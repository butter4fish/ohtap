Ian Seim: This is Ian Seim, and I&#8217;m speaking with Joanne Abel today, who is the Humanities and Adult Programming Coordinator at the Durham County Library, which is where we are right now doing the interview, before it opens. First, I&#8217;d like to start off with some general life history questions, so could you tell me a little bit about where you&#8217;re from?        Joanne Abel: I am from East Point, Georgia, which was a mill town but became a bedroom suburb by the time I was growing up. I went to Georgia Southern College in Statesboro, Georgia and majored in education. When I graduated in 1971, I went to Koinonia Partners in Americus, Georgia, which was an intentional community based on pacifism, racial justice, and peace that was founded in 1941 by Clarence Jordan, and Habitat for Humanity is a spin-off. I was there three years, a little over three years, and that was my first graduate school&#8212;it was a very amazing place with a lot of guys doing their Conscientious Objector, CO, volunteer work, there were Hutterites and Mennonites and Quakers and Hippies, and all kinds of people. It was a very exciting time, and that was a very formative experience. I actually was telling someone yesterday that I did some voter registration down there, and I went to one house, and the lady said, &#8217;Okay, you&#8217;re gonna give me a job and a house if I register to vote.&#8217; This is in 1972 and that was kind of mind-boggling, that there was still that prejudice in an area where SNCC and southwest Georgia project had done so much work in the sixties&#8212;it didn&#8217;t really feel that much different when we were there. I left there and moved to Durham in 1975, when I went to Duke, and I&#8217;ve been in Durham ever since. [19]74 actually, I moved here in October [19]74. I taught school for six years, and I became a librarian in 1980.         IS: Where did you teach?        JA: I taught in South Georgia at Koinonia        IS: Okay got it. So you came to Durham in 1975, you said&#8230;        JA: &#8216;74, October [19]74, but I usually just say [19]75.        IS: Okay, close to [19]75. I interviewed John Short earlier, before I interviewed you, and he said around Durham in the [19]80s, he was talking about the gay community here, and he said that there was this place called Little River where people would go, just to hang out at a creek, and go&#8212;he described it as a very idyllic type of setting. Did you ever visit that place?        JA: Yeah, it was a popular hiking place. I didn&#8217;t know it was&#8212;it was sort of a hookup place I think, for some gay men. The person that was killed was not gay. But it was a great place to go walking, and it&#8217;s where Little River Reservoir is now. But then, it was these pretty cliffs and good hiking trails, and people went there a lot and hiked. It was a well-known place. I won&#8217;t say anything more about Little River. But so much happened before, did you have more questions?        IS: Yeah, well, if there&#8217;s anything you want to talk about specifically, regarding the community before that&#8212;        JA: Before that, yeah, I think it&#8217;s really important&#8212;I came out, I moved to Durham basically to, I don&#8217;t&#8217; know if this is important, but to see if Christianity and feminism were compatible, so I went to Divinity school. And for me, I went there for a year and a half, that&#8217;s half an MDiv, which is not worth very much, and came out while I was there. Durham was a really heady place; TALF had formed, Triangle Area Lesbian Feminists, there was a real strong women&#8217;s center, there was a lot of women&#8217;s music happening, Ladyslipper was started in there, in 1976, which brought lots of attention, and women moved here. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I think we have such a strong lesbian community. But in 1979 was the Greensboro Massacre, I don&#8217;t know if you know about that. That was where the Klan clashed with some Communist Worker Party [CWP] people in Greensboro. They were having a march, an anti-Klan march, and the Klan killed five or six people. It was on tape, they were all acquitted, and that really&#8212;I hadn&#8217;t been a [lesbian] separatist, but I had been sort of a separatist; I still had a lot of men friends, but I was pretty much totally&#8212;all my energy had gone into the women&#8217;s movement, and the lesbian feminist movement. I think it was an identity time for us. As you can tell I had been pretty multi-issue at Koinonia with the race equality, and economic freedom, and peace, I&#8217;ve always been a pacifist. But that very scary, because it was very clear to me that the people with the Klan mentality, they didn&#8217;t really care, if you were gay or a woman or a black person or what, they just didn&#8217;t like you. So that was a wake-up call. I got involved with War Resistors League, and they [the CWP and anti-Klan progressive movements] had a big funeral march, and that was the [most scared] I&#8217;ve ever been. There were people on the buildings in Greensboro with AK-47s, the National guards, and you really didn&#8217;t think they were there to protect you. Because the police had been totally complicit in the Greensboro Massacre thing, there was an informer there, so it was&#8212;and a lot of Durham people were involved, a lot of Duke people were involved in the Communist Workers Party, and a couple of the doctors got killed. It was a very&#8212;Communist Workers [Party] was a very difficult group to work with in coalition, but because of that, I felt like that made Durham kind of, that really affected a lot of people in Durham, not only me, and I think that sort of set the climate for working in coalitions. I have to look at this date&#8230; There was this &#8220;Save our Democracy&#8221; conference pretty much after that at St. Joseph historic [African Methodist Episcopal (AME)] black church in Durham, and TALF had a table, we were the only gay presence there. TALF had a table with all the other progressive groups, and I remember it was like, we were accepted sort of, but it was also like we were claiming that we want to be part of this community and this organization. So when the Little River murder happened, in [19]71, no that&#8217;s not right&#8230;        IS: [19]81        JA: [19]81. There was already a foundation of at least some dialogue and at least some relationships, and at least some communications. So I think that really made things different in Durham, than other places.   IS: Because you&#8217;re already thinking about&#8230;  JA: the links.        IS: Right, exactly. You said TALF formed around that time?        JA: TALF formed actually earlier, it started as the lesbian rap group at Duke. It was before my time, but I think it was around [19]75, [19]76.                 IS: And then you later joined in, like, [19]70&#8212;        JA: When I moved here I pretty much got in, in [19]75 I was a member of TALF. It was a big group, we met at the YWCA, and there would be forty women often at the monthly meetings. And then Ladyslipper was doing a lot of music concerts&#8212;we had concerts that were bigger than the ones in Atlanta, at churches, and at Duke, and the Y had a concert space. I guess the other thing, I don&#8217;t know exactly when, when was Little River, was that October&#8230;        IS: It was in the summer&#8230;        JA: It was in the summer, yeah. But that year also, I forgot, October of [19]79 was the first march on Washington for lesbian and gay rights, and that was a real energizing thing for people. After the, after the Little River thing, I mean after the Greensboro Massacre we had that, so those were two really big marches. The trial for the Little River, we were really worried that it would just be blown over, that the two guys would get released without anything.        IS: Right, because that had been a standard thing, right? I guess it was call the &#8220;gay defense,&#8221; right? You could say that they were, you know&#8230;        JA: They were provoc&#8212;yeah.         IS: Propositioning.        JA: Yeah, and what happened was people from the library that I was working with, there was another out lesbian here, Nancy Blood, people from the library went with us, and we did protests, I think you probably saw pictures of the protest on Main Street, men wore coats and ties, and it was really powerful.                IS: This is in [19]81 you&#8217;re talking about?        JA: Yes after the march [in Washington]. And there were court watchers at the court every day. And Allan [Troxler] who I mentioned, he actually became acquaintances with both families of the victim and the people that did the shooting, so he has some really interesting stories. But it was-- they were convicted, and we were really surprised, but that was what was the basis of that first march. And the first march was really small, it went from downtown, from where Five Points is, near Toast and the Cupcake Bar, it went from there and it just went around the loop and then came back, so it was not very long. And we had to ask every store owner if they cared if we marched. [It turns out that this is standard procedure. I thought we were made to do it because of being gay!]        IS: Really, just in front of the stores?        JA: Just in front of the stores. I can&#8217;t imagine that was legal, but that was what, to get the permit, that&#8217;s what we had to do.        IS: You just had to ask the store owners, not the city?        JA: No we got the city permit, but they wanted that too, they wanted to make sure none of businesses&#8212;I can&#8217;t believe that was legal. But we did. And First Presbyterian Church was the one that we got childcare at, and that was pretty radical back then. I want to say there were maybe three hundred people in the march.        IS: Wow the first one.        JA: War Resistors League, which was a long-time, not religious, pacifist, multi-issue organization provided security. There were&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember any protestors, there might have been some, but it was so small and I think it was so low-key&#8212;we did get an article in the Herald Sun, I don&#8217;t know if you saw it&#8230;        IS: I did, yeah.        JA: We did get an article in the paper. It was not that many allies, I don&#8217;t remember but there were a lot of allies there, but not like the big march in [19]86, the first annual march. It wasn&#8217;t as scary as the march in Greensboro, the funeral march around the Greensboro Massacre, but it was still scary because we didn&#8217;t know about our jobs. I was out here, but I was new in the library, there were people that were supportive. I remember people wore paper bags over their heads, just to cover up.        IS: Just to protect their identity?        JA: One person went in a wheelchair because she thought her identity would be&#8212;that the way she walked was so distinctive that her boss might be able to see her. A lawyer didn&#8217;t want to march in it because they thought they could&#8212;a person in law school didn&#8217;t want to march because she thought that the ethics committee might not let her even take the BAR if she was there. So it was that level of fear. I don&#8217;t remember the police being particularly nice or particularly bad, they were just sort of there.        IS: That&#8217;s interesting. So it seems like there was already kind of an established community, but that didn&#8217;t feel really safe in public.         JA: Yeah, it was, yeah. And the original march committee was mostly women, I don&#8217;t know the exact percentage, but it was mostly women, which was another, I think, unique thing. I had a friend in Atlanta when we were talking about the [19]86 march, she said, &#8220;Oh were there many women involved?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; the planning committee had maybe three guys on it, and that was another thing that was a little different than other cities. We never talked about having another&#8212;after we did the first one it wasn&#8217;t like, oh we&#8217;ll do it again next year. It was like we needed to have a statement after the&#8212;        IS: The one response.        JA: --after the murder.        IS: Could you talk a little bit about how that came together, how that was organized?        JA: I was not on the inner circle of organizing, I don&#8217;t know if Allan was either. I know that it&#8212;I actually don&#8217;t&#8212;I know some of the people that were involved, but I just know that it was during the&#8212;I&#8217;m pretty sure that the idea of the march happened at the protest that we were doing,  out in front of the courthouse. I think people said, &#8216;It&#8217;s time, we need to have a visible presence, we need to not be afraid, we need to let people know that this is not going to force us back into a closet or make us go away.&#8217; And Allan made these great buttons, it was called &#8220;Our Day Out,&#8221; was what the march was called. And I think we just felt like we wanted to do that one&#8212;I think it did give people the space to feel they could be out more, but I still think it was so early that not much happened after that and people still went to TALF. I don&#8217;t know of&#8212;there was a men&#8217;s groups that I know of, which is going to be mind-boggling, there was an English country dancing group that was led predominantly by Carl Wittman, who actually wrote the Gay Manifesto, he was a pretty famous person who&#8217;d become a staff person for PIRG down here.  He and his partner, Allan, who I&#8217;ve mentioned, they did English country dancing. That was an organizing thing for gay men even though other people came, it was where they could be not in a bar and yet be together. And that was the other contingent in Durham, which again is pretty weird, and different. And sometimes we had live music. So, yes, and people from Chapel Hill certainly came over, but it was definitely a Durham-based event. I know they met at the library some for their planning processes. There was a newsletter then, [called The Newsletter]. [It] was created after the Little River where&#8212;there was a monthly, really, newsletter thing, and then a mid-month calendar of events because the Little River murder let people know we needed a way to communicate more regularly, and that&#8217;s the thing that happened. It&#8217;s amazing to think with all of the different ways we can communicate now, but we really used that twice-a-month print piece to communicate.        IS: Now, was that actually called the Newsletter?        JA: It was called The Newsletter because we had called it Feminary before, Feminary had spun off and become a literary magazine, so the calendar was called Around the Triangle, with a purple triangle, but we never could figure out another name for that, so that was kind of sad. But Debby Swanner was involved in that, Joe Herzenberg, the original planning committee. I don&#8217;t think Nancy Blood, the other librarian, was. It was pretty&#8212;the War Resistors League took a big lead in it, and I know Donnia Sutherland, who just passed a couple of years ago, was really involved. The War Resistors League had a working committee, and a lot of those folks were involved in the hands-on stuff. They weren&#8217;t necessarily gay but they were allies and they had experience with doing demonstrations and things.        IS: And you said you started working at the library in 1980? I guess what I&#8217;m trying to ask is did you help get the meetings come to the library?  JA: The library has the best space, it had the best neutral space.        IS: Okay, it was just a natural place to be at.         JA: It was just a natural place. My boss was very conservative, and she was still my boss in 1986, but it was more going to the marches, and going to the rally. It wasn&#8217;t that we were&#8212;I didn&#8217;t come out to my boss at that point.        IS: Oh ok she didn&#8217;t know.        JA: She didn&#8217;t know, but a lot of people knew because they would go with me to the demonstrations. We were a little worried about her because she voted for Jesse Helms, so we were really worried about how she was going to be about stuff. She ended up being fine.         IS: But at that point, you felt it was a covert thing going on.         JA: Yeah, we did.        IS: That actually leads well into something that I wanted to talk about, that happened later. I do want to fill in what happened between 1981 and 1986, because I wasn&#8217;t able to find a whole lot about what happened there. But I heard, or I read about something here actually, which happened in 1986 at this library, where there was a gay pride month display here that caused a lot of controversy.         JA: It did, it did. Nancy and I put that up. We did it on our day off, and we used our own personal materials. So it was completely okay, because community groups could use any of the display cases, any community group could do it. We did it as TALF I think. There was no formal procedure to do it, you could just call up whoever was booking, I don&#8217;t remember who that was, but probably a circulation person. The day we were putting it up, one of the pages, who are the folks who shelve the books, was at Mt Zion. He was a member of Mt. Zion church, and that was Reverend Forzar, who was extremely homophobic and very anti-gay. So by Sunday, it was out in that community that there was a lesbian, gay display. And it was books that the library had, and some albums, music albums, and buttons. That was it.        IS: That was it?        JA: That was it. It was so tame. It was so tame. And we used books that the library had.        IS: So pretty much just collected some things.        JA: We used our copies so the other ones could be there, so people could check them out. We had it up for a month. And we also, Meg Segress, that woman I showed you, she got the mayor to sign a proclamation for human rights, it didn&#8217;t even say gay rights.        IS: Yeah was that the anti-discrimination week proclamation?        JA: Yes, yes.        IS: I have that as June 22-29.        JA: This was before that. And I told the director, when it hit the fan, the library did great. Everybody stood behind us. It was amazing. That&#8217;s when I came out big-time to everybody in the library, my boss was fine. I was on the book-mobile then.         IS: Was that surprising, when it was so accepted?        JA: It was surprising, it was totally surprising. But it was also very affirming, it was very affirming. One of the women who works at the circulation desk, she&#8217;s long gone, she said, &#8216;You know, I don&#8217;t understand all this, but I&#8217;m Catholic, and I know how when we moved out here my little boy got punched out for wearing his St. Christopher medal, so I think we all have to get along and people need to be&#8212;,&#8217;you know it was that kind of stuff that was really wonderful. People would come up every&#8212;I was almost afraid to go up the stairs&#8212;it&#8217;s where the seed display was, where I showed you. People would come up and they&#8217;d be writing down all the titles. The library got all kinds of negative stuff. The paper&#8212;I don&#8217;t know if you saw&#8212;my favorite editorial was that the library&#8217;s place is &#8220;to offend as well as inform.&#8221; I thought that was the perfect&#8212; and that was the editorial in the Durham Morning Herald, supporting us to have it. The country manager supported it, the library board said there&#8217;s nothing wrong with this. We have things on every point of view. It was a rough first two weeks though. They talked about picketing the library, nobody did. But then, when Mayor Gulley did sign that proclamation, the focus changed immediately from the library to a recall of Mayor Gulley.        IS: So how much before was the library display?        JA: It was about a week and a half to two weeks. So we were up a little bit before, but we knew we had&#8212;and then we put the display up, we put the proclamation up as soon as we got it.        IS: So maybe that sparked some of the recall stuff that happened?        JA: Yeah, it was all one big ball of wax. They thought, &#8216;These people are just taking over everywhere.&#8217; Some people from the library&#8212;this was so funny. There was the petition drive to recall mayor Gulley. Then there was People&#8217;s Alliance, and some of the other groups, I don&#8217;t remember if there was a formal one. They started a petition drive to support Mayor Gulley, even though it had no meaning. So there would be a library person, one of our friends&#8212;two library people on two different corners supporting different things. But it was still okay. There was a great editorial [cartoon], I don&#8217;t know if you saw it. It was a black man and a white man at a &#8220;get rid of Gulley&#8221; thing, and the white man&#8217;s looking at the black man saying, &#8216;You know it used to be easier to tell who you hated.&#8217;        IS: Oh the cartoon yeah. That one&#8217;s funny, yeah.        JA: Yes, I loved that one. I just loved that one. But he did not get recalled, there were not enough things, and he was elected in the next&#8212;he was re-elected. That was a really intense month, and everybody, I mean&#8230;It really brought things out, and there were hundreds of letters to the editor. The library got some flack, but the director would call me in and say, &#8216;I got a five dollar bill in the mail, I got a ten dollar bill in the mail,&#8217; with no words, just support. So that was pretty cool.         IS: Did you feel for the most part then, that Durham as a community was on the right side?        JA: Absolutely. I really do, I really do. And I think that goes back, all the way back to the work that was done and coalitions with the different issues and the different groups, there had been an anti-Klan rally at some point and people were very visible and different, affinity groups. I really think it made a difference. And that march, that first annual march, in [19]86&#8212;people have debated if it was half allies, but it was a lot of people, because people really were supporting mayor Gulley.        IS: And that was right around that&#8212;that was the same summer.        JA: Yeah that was the same summer and that was the end of that month, just about. Now there were still people, a lot of teachers were incognito or wore wigs, and some brown paper bag masks and stuff, but it was so affirming. We had the rally at the Reservoir at the end of Club Boulevard. It was incredible, it was really amazing. That was a big rally. A lot of kids, a lot of&#8212;and it was really amazing. It was an amazing experience.                 IS: How many people would you say were in that march?        JA: Gosh, I don&#8217;t know. With the march and the rally it could have been up towards a thousand, I&#8217;m not sure. And it went from, where did it go from? It started from, if I can remember this right, I think it started from near where the Ronald McDonald house is, the Quaker meeting house, and the Episcopal student union over by Duke. And it wound its way down Club Boulevard to the Reservoir. And there was a big committee on that one, Meredith Emmett was on it. There was a lot of young Duke students on it as well as some of the older people, who were maybe 35, on it. That was a bigger committee. There was a straight-ally group that did all the&#8212;they raised a lot of money for the ads in the paper. There was a faith coalition that went around and talked to all the different minsters to get them to sign, supporting the march. There were a lot of moving pieces on that committee, and it was very well organized. And that committee became the committee that ran the march for several years.         IS: Were you a part of that committee?        JA: I was tangentially a part of that committee. I did a lot of different things. We were mainly doing the stuff at the library though, with that.        IS: But all the momentum&#8212;it seems like the momentum from the library display and then the mayor Gulley things, led directly into the march.         JA: Absolutely. The other march you sort of had to know about, even though there were signs. This one, it was like the whole town knew about it, whether you liked it or not.                IS: Yeah, that&#8217;s great. Okay well, I want to move back a little bit, just to talk about what happened in between 1981 and 1986. I couldn&#8217;t really find a whole lot about, really what was going on in the community at that point. Although, I mean, I know there wasn&#8217;t another march, and there weren&#8217;t many big spectacle type of things, but, I heard a little bit about there being like, there being these spaghetti dinners.        JA: Yes, Stonewall, yes. Joe Herzenberg, who was the first out, elected official in North Carolina Chapel Hill City Council, was one of the movers and shakers there. It was held at Binkley Baptist church, and it was a wonderful&#8212;we keep talking about maybe getting it going again. But they were spaghetti dinners, Faga beu Mirian always made the bread I believe, or desserts, he was another character. It was more men originally. And it was around Stonewall in June, and it raised money for different issues. I remember one time it was a custody case. A Chapel Hill woman was going to lose her kids, because she&#8217;d come out. Other times it was for HIV stuff, and AIDS stuff. That was a wonderful thing, and that happened, I don&#8217;t know when they started, but they certainly went all through the eighties. And there could be, I don&#8217;t know how many that hall would fit&#8212;I mean there would be two or three hundred people there. And there&#8217;d always be a speaker, and it was great. Everybody&#8212;people donated the food, and the labor, and it raised a lot of money. The other things, there was&#8212;let&#8217;s see, that was before&#8212;the Durham Women&#8217;s Health Collective, then, and there was the Lesbian and Gay Health Task Force that David Jolly who&#8217;s now at North Carolina Central, he was one of the main healthcare things, and they were operating in the eighties. They were&#8212;they started before the AIDS epidemic hit. And they were doing survey to find out if lesbians and gay men were getting proper health care, if they had come out to their physicians. They were doing physician surveys to find out which ones were open to having LGBT patients. And then when the AIDS thing hit, it morphed into that. And then there was the AIDS service project that also got going around that time too. Ladyslipper was still going on, doing concerts, and workshops; the women&#8217;s center did a lot of workshops. Everything from car repair to southern literature, women&#8217;s literature. There were a lot of consciousness-raising groups and a lot of theory groups. People were reading and talking. Let&#8217;s see, what were some of the other groups, TALF? TALF went on until the [19]90s, I don&#8217;t know when it actually went defunct. And I think partly&#8212;oh then there was Our Own Place, which was a lesbian space in Durham that operated for about, I&#8217;m not sure, but I want to say about five or six  years, in the late [19]80s early [19]90s, I think. There were the Lesbian Thespians that was an acting group that put on several plays. Let&#8217;s see, what else&#8230;I have all my seventies stuff here, but I don&#8217;t have.        IS: If you want to talk about that as well&#8230;        JA: Well there was another thing. Joanne Little was a black woman who assaulted her jailor, and there became a whole lot of activity around supporting her in jail. A book was published, Break the Chains of US Slavery, by a local women&#8217;s print collective. So there was that in the seventies. There was a lot of&#8212;well I said Feminary, which started as a newsletter and became a literary magazine. There was the Duke Women&#8217;s Radio Collective that operated on WDBS at Duke, we had two spots in the morning at night with like three minutes of news, and they had a music program on Sunday night. And Celeste Weston, who is with NPR now, she was there, and Chris Carroll, who&#8217;s in Atlanta and also did some public radio work. There was Dykes and Tikes for lesbians with children, which was more unusual then. Let&#8217;s see, anything else I have? There was another march on Washington, the Great March on Washington where they say a half a million people, in 87. Lots of Durham people went up for that, that was the second march for lesbian and gay rights, and that&#8217;s when the quilt was there, the AIDS quilt was there. And Cesar Chavez and Elly&#8212;what&#8217;s her name&#8212;Elly Small from NOW was there. And then the, oh the radical fairies were there. We did a lot around the ERA, in coalition with straight women in the seventies. I can&#8217;t think of anything else.        IS: Well that&#8217;s a lot!        JA: I can&#8217;t think of anything else to fill in that period.         IS: But it seems that there was still a very active, vibrant community.         JA: There was, and I don&#8217;t know why there weren&#8217;t marches. I really don&#8217;t know why that didn&#8217;t happen. But there was still tons of stuff going on.        IS: Just not as public, maybe.        JA: Lots of concerts and stuff, I mean big concerts. There was a Holly Near concert at memorial that sold out Memorial Hall [at UNC-Chapel Hill]. That was another mixed concert because she was a big pacifist and has a cross-over audience. But I don&#8217;t know why there wasn&#8217;t marches between that time.        IS: Do you think maybe it could be because people felt afraid at the first one? Or was it not necessarily like that?        JA: We were, I think we were cautiously afraid. I think that&#8217;s true.  I think we didn&#8217;t know if there was going to be Klan people there, if there was going to be people&#8212;you know what was going to be the reception. I remember at the rally there was some people that sang and read and talked, it was a typical political rally, there was no&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember any hostility. I remember hostility much more at the later ones where there&#8217;d be organized groups you know, chanting and yelling at us. But I don&#8217;t remember any at that original one. But it was still very&#8212;I guess people didn&#8217;t want to&#8212;you&#8217;re right, that maybe it was fear that we didn&#8217;t want to do it again. We felt like we had to make the statement when the young man was killed, but after that it was like okay, let&#8217;s see what happens.         IS: Especially given that a lot of people were afraid of like, losing their jobs.        JA: Or their kids, yeah.        IS: Yeah, I heard an interesting thing actually. John Short told me that he had a friend who was actually one of the people that was assaulted at the Little River beatings, and he was asked to testify to identify some of the people, in court. He was afraid to do that, and then he ended up losing his job, actually, because he testified.        JA: Did he? Yeah.        IS: It was shocking to me.        JA: Yeah well we, one of the things that we did much later, I would say in the 90s, is we wanted Durham County to do domestic partnership benefits for its employees. And we got a petition form the library, partly because all this other stuff. About 85 percent of all the library staff signed it and said that we want our coworkers who are gay or lesbian to have the same benefits that we do. So there was that kind of thing going on. The city gave domestic partnership rights much earlier than the county, the county was five years behind the city. Chapel Hill did it before Durham County, and Orange County did it before. So there was that thing going on, but when I look back now, I [am] stunned at the difference that has happened, really quickly.        IS: Just in terms of acceptance?        JA: Yes, yes. I mean, Durham voted, what was it, almost eighty percent against the amendment [Amendment 1 in May 2012], which was pretty amazing.        IS: Yeah, definitely.        JA: I&#8217;d love to talk with some other people about what their theory is about why there wasn&#8217;t marches after [19]81, I mean that&#8217;s five years with nothing. And we had, gosh what is [their] name, Luke, did you bump into Luke&#8217;s research? [They&#8217;re] the one who&#8217;s been helping Lynn collect the archives.        IS: Oh okay.        JA: She held a meeting at the Friends Meeting House sometime, I guess last fall, and Meredith Emmett, who is one of the planners of the [19]86 march, actually has a video tape of that march, that someone took on a 8 millimeter camera. It was pretty funny, but&#8230;        IS: Why is that?        JA: Just because it was so, I mean everybody&#8212;some people didn&#8217;t want to be in it, and it was just fun to see, you know. But there was a lot of people there who were trying to remember things, and it&#8217;s like we really, when you&#8217;re in the moment, it&#8217;s hard to remember&#8212;when you look back, it&#8217;s hard to remember all the details of what was really going on. And nobody brought up the question about why there wasn&#8217;t, what that five year gap was about, which is a really good question.        IS: Right.        JA: Because we certainly were going to Washington for marches. I mean it&#8217;s not like it wasn&#8217;t something that was, you know&#8230;        IS: You didn&#8217;t feel like there was a lull really?        JA: No, I mean. We should&#8217;ve, but there wasn&#8217;t. But we just, yeah.        IS: So why do you think then, marches did start happening after the [19]86 march? Because that&#8217;s when it became an annual thing.        JA: I don&#8217;t know, I think, and at first&#8212;a lot of us old-timers go, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not a protest march any more, it&#8217;s a celebration and a parade,&#8221; so a lot of people don&#8217;t even go, it&#8217;s so amazing to watch.        IS: And I do want to ask you about that later, what do you think about how its changed, because it&#8217;s certainly changed a lot.        JA: We always had a list of demands, what the march was for. I remember one of the ones, one of the first ones at East Campus, it was extremely powerful. They gave out red ribbons for everyone in North Carolina that had died of HIV/AIDS, and then all those people came up to the front of the rally, and it was extremely powerful. And we were pushing for more healthcare, and job security, and for domestic partnership benefits, and now it&#8217;s just a big party. And it&#8217;s still a lot of fun, and all the vendors, the fact that there&#8217;s a  kazillion vendors, and bank of America, and Home Depot, you know all the different sponsors, that&#8217;s like wow. And really different, a really different model. But it&#8212;if you John hadn&#8217;t taken it up, it would not have happened, and I don&#8217;t know if he told you&#8212;when did he take it over, do you know?        IS: So apparently in 2000, the committee was struggling to get the march together, right at the end, I guess. And he and another woman, who I&#8217;m forgetting her name right now but, but he and&#8212;they said that they were going to try to pull it together, right at the end. And somehow were able to do that, and then, from there, just&#8212;he assumed that position. I think that was in 2000 or 2001, is when that happened.        JA: And what happened, I don&#8217;t remember when, but for a while, they rotated. They would be in the triangle and then they&#8217;d be in another city.        IS: Right would be in different cities, yeah.         JA: And then the groups got&#8212;the one in Asheville I did not go to, it&#8217;s the only one I didn&#8217;t go to, and everyone said that one was kind of scary.        IS: Why was that?        JA: Asheville was not as liberal as it is now, but there were a lot of anti-protesters there. And they said it was the first march since that first one that people had been scared at, because of the feeling. You know Asheville is such a cool city, it&#8217;s kind of hard to imagine, but I think that was earlier on.        IS: I don&#8217;t know, I actually heard something the other day about&#8212; a couple of years ago in Asheville, there was some people beating lesbians and gay people&#8212;with somebody driving around in a car that had a bat apparently, did you hear about this at all?        JA: Wow, just whack people?        IS: Yeah, just hit people on the street. It was a couple of years ago.        JA: That&#8217;s pretty scary.        IS: I was shocked to hear that. I have a friend who used to live in Asheville, and she was telling me this.         JA: Yeah, because I love Asheville, I don&#8217;t want to hear that.         IS: I know, I was really shocked. But that&#8217;s interesting to hear that that was a place where they felt scared as well.        JA: Yeah. And then it was in Winston, and Raleigh a couple of times. Carrboro, of course, which was really fun. And then it settled to Durham because there was the organizing base here.        IS: So it was kind of like the organizing group in Durham went to these different places?        JA: They tried to get other people to have a local organizing committee, but the Durham committee would often provide a lot of technical assistance.        IS: Okay.        JA: And I don&#8217;t know if they just aged out. Most of the people were my age or maybe ten years younger, of the [19]86 group. So it was probably time&#8212;John is certainly no spring chicken, though. And I have heard that the group lost its non-profit status, so I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s true. But for a while we were a 501C-3 or 501C-4, I don&#8217;t remember which. I don&#8217;t know if they got it back again, but that&#8212;maybe it didn&#8217;t need to be because of all the ads and, the booklets and all that stuff. But that&#8217;s really different, I mean I remember the first time we had a vendor, and it was like, it would be completely gay vendor stuff. Rainbow this and rainbow that, and then the gay travel stuff would be there. And the book stores, those were the first vendors, there were maybe ten. And now it&#8217;s like a fair.        IS: Yeah.        JA: It really is.        IS: So, was is it like a definite point then, to go into these marches thinking about them as being political, more like civil rights marches?        JA: Oh yeah, they were very much like civil rights marches.         IS: And that was a definite decision made to do that.         JA: Yeah, and I don&#8217;t know when that changed, I really don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t have a sense about that. I would say probably in the late 1990s.        IS: When it shifted to more of a celebration kind of thing. John Short told me he made a definite effort to shift away from being so political.        JA: Oh really? Uh huh.         IS: And tried to make it more of a&#8212;feel more like a homecoming, or a celebration.         JA: Uh huh, and I think that&#8217;s fine. I think that people need a time to celebrate, and we have so many people that come from all over the state. And the act that they can be out, and feel free, is just wonderful. I mean the fact that they put&#8212;I think it was Carrboro was the first time they put the rainbow banners up on the lamppost, and when I saw that, it was amazing. It was totally, like, wow. But yeah, I think its fine, I do think it&#8217;s not&#8212;I think there&#8217;s still a lot of issues that affect the community. I think this healthcare thing, I think that&#8217;s really important, because a lot of LGBT people need, decent healthcare. So I still think it would be nice if there was a little bit more of a political flavor to it. But it certainly don&#8217;t fault the celebration, I think that every community needs a celebration too.        IS: Yeah, that&#8217;s a question I&#8217;ve had about it. By not being so political, or being much less like a civil rights march, I think it attracts, it just attracts&#8212;more people are willing to be around something like that.        JA: Oh yeah.        IS: So, I guess, it&#8217;s grown a lot in size from what it used to be.         JA: Oh yes, from the early days.        IS: And maybe that, in and of itself, is a political thing, just having that many people be out there. I don&#8217;t know what you thought about that.        JA: Yeah. I do think that, and I think the diversity is pretty amazing, I mean I&#8217;m always amazed at the number of Latina folks that are here now. There&#8217;s actually two wonderful gay men that work at El Centro, and they are&#8212;one&#8217;s an HIV educator and the other is a community organizer. So you know, it amazing the diversity at the parades. I don&#8217;t know, and I don&#8217;t really think that&#8212;I think there&#8217;s still a lot of straight allies that come, just for the celebration part. I&#8217;m in a little neighborhood of maybe 15 houses, and usually half of our neighborhood shows up, just to watch. One time we had three babies, the straight people brought their babies there with them, and that felt really neat. That it&#8217;s such an event, you want to go see all the costumes and the music, and everything. I think that&#8217;s fine, I do. And I think you&#8217;re right that if it was&#8212;if it did have requests, demands, or political agendas, it would really cut down on the number of people that would. Probably more out of town than Durham since Durham is such a political place. But, the only thing I&#8217;ve heard&#8212;and I wonder, does John, does he have a committee? Is it pretty much himself that does it? He has to have a bunch of people to pull it off.                IS: I think he has several committees that work on different things, and he oversees that.         JA: Because it is huge! I mean just the publication of that brochure must be, the Pride Guide is like, huge. I know how much work that would be, to do. But Durham is just&#8212;you know when I go visit&#8212;my mom lives in, outside of Atlanta, way outside in Fulham county, way, way outside of Atlanta, and I feel like an anthropologist when I go there. There&#8217;s&#8212;it&#8217;s very white, it&#8217;s very straight, it&#8217;s very conservative, and it&#8217;s so different than here. I wonder how it feels for someone, when they visit Durham.         IS: To come here, right.         JA: Yeah. You really feel the divide of the country because they are very different. I mean, where she lives, this to me is just astounding, they have three different garbage companies that you can contract with to get your garbage. Which means three times a week, big trucks rumble through your neighborhood and spill trash all over the road, because they don&#8217;t want to pay taxes for a garbage place. There&#8217;s no sidewalks, it&#8217;s a really long way to park. They have really low taxes. And were so, yes we want to pay a penny for our parks, it&#8217;s such a different mindset, and  I think that&#8217;s all involved with the way the community perceives itself as a welcoming, inclusive community that wants to have things for people.        IS: Do you think it&#8217;s been like that since you came here, did you have that sense when you first came here?        JA: Oh, well I came before you were born, late [19]74 early [19]75. I was working in a daycare center before I started Duke, because I started Duke in January, and I rode my bike from west Durham to east Durham, and I worked in a daycare center, which was mostly African American kids. I&#8217;ve always loved Durham&#8212;it was gritty, it was real, [back then] there was one or two restaurants downtown. But I always loved it because it felt like a real place, there were real people, you got to know the person at the hardware store, the person at the grocery store, you got to know them. So I just fell in love with Durham from the beginning. Duke has all the cultural things you could possibly want, a lot of them were free back then. So yeah, but I&#8212;and the women&#8217;s community was already forming pretty well then, so it was a really good place for me to land. I was trying to decide to move here or Boston, and I&#8217;m really glad I moved here because I think this was the right sized city for me. And Durham is a very livable place, I think the triangle is a very livable place. It&#8217;s big enough to have anything you need, but it&#8217;s still small enough you can know people. And now it&#8217;s gotten and better and better. I think every year Durham&#8217;s gotten better and better.        IS: Yeah, all of my friends are moving to Durham.         JA: Yeah, I know, I know. Used to be you wanted to move to Carrboro        IS: Yeah they&#8217;re leaving Carrboro now, it&#8217;s like an exodus.        JA: Yeah, actually the woman who is doing the history of drag [program for us] just moved from Carrboro to Durham. She&#8217;s living in Cleveland Holloway, which is over there, and one of the people said, &#8216;Oh you mean Cleveland Hollowgay,&#8217; I said, &#8216;Oh okay.&#8217; But yeah when I started here in 1980, I never would have thought that neighborhood would become a hipster neighborhood, that&#8217;s mind-boggling to me.         IS: Let&#8217;s see, oh one more thing sure.                JA: The other thing in the [19]80s during that period, there were too big women&#8217;s&#8212;Ladyslipper at one point employed 21 women. And then there was Travis Place which was a cotton underwear place that employed about 20 women. And then there was Francesca&#8217;s. There were lesbian businesses in Durham which also made a difference, in terms of making it a safe space. I think maybe interfacing with other parts of the community, because here were people who were entrepreneurs and bringing in money to the community. And the other thing, the gay folk dancing thing, but there was a lot of women involved with the AIDS service project, I don&#8217;t know the exact name of it. And there was an AIDS house, it&#8217;s now where the Eno River [Association]&#8217;s headquarters is. There was a garden there, and there was a lot of involvement with support with the early HIV stuff, with the lesbian community. So that was where a lot of the lesbians and gay men began to meet. It was from the health project originally, and then interfacing with HIV stuff.         IS: Before that was there, was there much mixing between the gay and lesbian communities?        JA: There wasn&#8217;t except for the folk dancing, the English country dancing thing.        IS: But other than that it was not really&#8230;        JA: It was not. And I remember Nancy, the woman that worked at the library, when Carl and Allan moved here from Oregon, they had us over for dinner, because we knew them through the War Resistors League, and they said, &#8216;Well ok, where are the other gay men, and how do we meet them?&#8217; and we said, &#8216;You&#8217;re the only gay men we know.&#8217; So it was kind of funny. But they sort of created their own community around the dancing, and one of the earlier&#8212;this woman is graduated, she&#8217;s from graduate school, she was Jeffrey and Mab Barb, and Jeffrey, I just forgot the guy from Central&#8217;s name. But anyway, they were the first, intentional, lesbian and gay couples to have kids that I know. And I was talking at Duke to a group of students, and they were laughing and they said, &#8216;We thought that turkey baster thing was all imaginative,&#8217; and David Jolly said, &#8216;Oh no!&#8217; So David and Barbara were the biological parents of Annie Elizabeth. But all [two] couples, all four [people] were involved in raising her, which was really interesting back then, because not many lesbian&#8212;the lesbians in the early seventies and eighties, if they had kids, they were usually from previous relationships. But David and that [three], they lived in two houses sort of close to each other, over in East Durham. That was really unique, and David talked a lot about what it was like for them to be gay men that chose to have a child back then. Their support group was the dance, was the English country dancing group. So there was that kind of stuff going on, I mean Durham was just&#8212;you could do pretty much what you wanted, you could try different things in Durham, which was fun.        IS: You mentioned before that, that first committee, that organized the first march and the courthouse vigils and all that, was mostly women. Did that continue on throughout the other marches?        JA: It did, they got more mixed as they went on, but that [19]86 march was also majority women.        IS: Okay. Why do you think it was like that?        JA: I think because the lesbian community was just more organized, and actually more political, at that point. The gay men&#8217;s community, that I can&#8217;t speak for, but my thinking is it didn&#8217;t really become political until HIV hit, and became a real political issue. A lot of their energy was dealing with that.        IS: Whereas the women&#8217;s community was more involved before.        JA: Yeah because of feminism, because most of us considered ourselves lesbian feminists, so we were definitely political from pretty much the get-go. Or some form of political.        IS: That&#8217;s interesting to hear that. Just to bring up John&#8212;he had interesting things to say reflecting about&#8212;John Short did, about what he had heard about these earlier things, because he went back and apparently interviewed some of the people, when he was getting involved. He said he got a big impression that, it was mostly women that did all of the work, with the committees and things, but that a lot of the men got the credit for it, but couldn&#8217;t tell him what had been going on, or what really happened. Whereas the women, knew exactly what was going on.        JA: That would be&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember the men getting the credit for it, they might have thought they did, but we all knew who did the&#8212;but I don&#8217;t know the later ones, I really don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know the ones from like 1995 to the changeover. I would go to marches, but I wasn&#8217;t involved even tangentially in any of the planning or anything.         IS: What were the marches like after that [19]86 one?        JA: They were pretty much the same. There wasn&#8217;t the urgency, so I think they were a little smaller, there would be&#8212;we were downtown again, I remember we marched around the loop sometimes, and we&#8217;d go down Main Street. And then they ended up at East Campus, where we&#8217;d walk around East Campus, Broad street, 9th street, our territory. Like I said, I remember the first one at East Campus, there were like three, five, or six vendors, and it was really fun because it was so exciting to go to see the stuff, you couldn&#8217;t buy anywhere else unless you went to a big city or something. There was always pre-rallies, and one thing that&#8217;s different, I think they&#8217;ve become&#8212;there was always a religious component with the different churches and stuff, but I think that component has really grown. The community of faith that&#8217;s involved is way bigger than it was early on. That and the Hispanic communities are the two that I think are the biggest new additions to the march. I went to the HK on J march in Raleigh in, whenever that was. It amazed me at the&#8212;it was the most diverse march I&#8217;ve ever been to. And it was amazing to me to see the coalitions all together. There was a strong LGBT presence, there was a strong Youth Dreamers, Hispanic young women and men, there was a strong&#8212;you know of course the civil rights movement, the church movement. And I thought, this is in some ways&#8212;our marches or parades are, they don&#8217;t have the people of color percentage as much, but those are the two most diverse marches I&#8217;ve ever been to; where you really have people from all walks of life, and all ages, and all economic levels, that kind of thing. So I do think that the march has grown. And now it&#8217;s a statewide march, too, and I don&#8217;t know if it was always a statewide march, or for a while it felt like it was the Durham march, or the Triangle march. I don&#8217;t know when they started rotating, but I know for a long time we really felt like it was a triangle thing. Then Raleigh and Charlotte started having their own festivals and stuff. I can get you the names of some people who were actually on the main&#8212;Allan was on the organizing committee if this isn&#8217;t going to be enough meat for your report.        IS: Oh no, no this is fine. It&#8217;s not like I really need to know the super fine details of what went into the organization. I mean, it sounds like you participated in many of these things.        JA: The Newsletter, I will tell you, the Newsletter that was started after the march, after the Little River thing in [19]81, it was a pretty big community organizing thing. It would&#8212;one of the&#8212;the way the community got involved with it, was you could put a flier in the newsletter, you had to pay like twenty bucks and have a person come to help do to the collating. Sometimes we&#8217;d have 15 or 20 fliers, and they could be everything form a yard sale you were having to book reading, a program. That was&#8212;that would be a way, not only to get the word out, but it also was a way where different groups of people would mix together, and talk, and interface. That happened twice a month, through that whole period. That was, I&#8217;m trying to think if we ever had any&#8212;we did have some gay things, but it was 90 percent women&#8217;s stuff. Except for the marches of course, which would be publicized heavily in there. And I remember, so glad when it changed from June to October. Oh god! I don&#8217;t know&#8212;I remember the Carrboro one where people were passing out, maybe the second Carrboro one, because it was so hot. And these gay guys in front of me, they said, &#8216;Can&#8217;t we march in the fall? Wasn&#8217;t Judy Garland born in October or something, we can&#8217;t do this anymore!&#8217; I said that&#8217;s true. That was the best thing was when it changed to October, or September now, I thinks it&#8217;s the last Saturday in September.        IS: The reason it was in the summer though was to commemorate the Stonewall riots, yeah.        JA: Yeah but that&#8217;s ok for New York. It&#8217;s not okay for the south. I think San Francisco still has theirs in June. I think a lot of places still do. But man, that was&#8212;it can still be hot in September though. I think two years ago was the first time I was cold. It was a cold rainy September, and I cannot believe I am cold at a march.        IS: Yeah I think that&#8217;s another very simple thing that changed that has led to a lot more people coming.         JA: Oh yeah.        IS: You know you&#8217;re on the asphalt, you don&#8217;t want to be in 100 degree weather.        JA: And people were literally falling out in Carrboro, they had the ambulance come up for a couple of people. We were in&#8212;where the Farmer&#8217;s Market is now, it was a big, sunny, no-trees meadow, and it was brutal, it really was. I remember our Dykes on Bikes, I mean the&#8212;that led the original parade were often on bicycles instead of motorcycles. Now they have real motorcycles, but I always thought that was pretty funny.        IS: So did you get the feeling that during those parades, where it was always in the summer, super hot, very politically motivated, what kind of atmosphere was it like?        JA: It was still defiant and celebratory. After the first couple ones, I think people&#8212;after mayor Gulley won his re-election, I think that really empowered people to feel like the majority of Durham were our allies, if not our friends. So the marches became a lot&#8212;became fun, they became festive, I think. But they still had the political thing.        IS: What kind of things would you do to try to push certain political issues?        JA: I believe&#8212;we would, we had a legislative agenda that we would take to the local government people and say these are our concerns, this is what we would like to work on. Often we would have, I know at one point we tried to recruit people to run for office, LGBT to run for office but nobody wants to do that, it&#8217;s like, boring. One thing, I&#8217;ll throw this in, because this might be interesting to you. This is the tenth anniversary for the Beaver Queen Pageant. And this is a little bit&#8212;it&#8217;s in June, and the founder wanted it to be&#8212;I see you haven&#8217;t heard of it. The founder wanted it to be, felt like we should do something in June for Stonewall for LGBT, but it started as a community celebration because the Duke neighborhood was fighting the DOT, department of transportation, when they were widening 85, and some beavers had built a lodge, and it was flooding some yards, and so the DOT thing. So the neighborhood fought the DOT, got the beavers relocated instead of whacked, and impromptu had a beaver queen celebration for people in beaver drag to compete to be beaver queen in Duke park with a karaoke machine. It has grown to around 800 people. People compete. This was, so 10 years ago was near the Gore, Bush election, so you bribe the judges, you can buy your judgeship, and you had to punch hanging chads to be able to vote, and we counted the hanging chads. Now it&#8217;s more formalized, and five or six compete, people compete in beaver drag, it has to be completely family friendly. So there&#8217;s kids running around, it has to be where a ten year old might not understand all the puns and jokes and stuff. Frank Stasio from the State of Things is the emcee. You compete in ready-wet-wear, talent, and then questions. And it&#8217;s amazing, and it raises money for the Ellerbe Creek Watershed Association, so its real strong ecological force, flavor. The queens have been male, female, gay, straight, Hispanic&#8212;we have a current Hispanic queen right now, Furbella. It is a completely Durham event, that you can&#8217;t explain until you&#8217;ve been there. There&#8217;s all kinds of puns, some of the contestants have been Scarlett O. Beaver, Belvis, Fur Pelton John, Badonna, and it has a little bit of a flavor of a gay pride event, a kid&#8217;s birthday party, a political rally, and Durham craziness. And so that&#8217;s what people do in June, a lot of people, a lot of neighborhood people do that in June, and it always definitely has a queer flavor, even though everybody comes and everybody loves it. It raises a lot of money for the Ellerbe Creek Watershed Association, and the beavers of the Beaver March which we actually helped purchase with money from the festival. And that was a neighborhood group that decided something needed to happen in June to commemorate Stonewall.        IS: Right, since the parades moved out of that time. And that&#8217;s been going on for ten years?        JA: Ten years, this is the tenth anniversary. The guy that&#8217;s going to be doing the art history of drag, he&#8217;s competing this year. So I think he&#8217;s going to be a formidable candidate.        IS: Yeah it sounds like he&#8217;s got the background for it.        JA: But you have beaver tails, that&#8217;s the other thing, you&#8217;re judged for your tail. I have a lovely beaver tail with sequins.        IS: Have you ever competed?        JA: I&#8217;ve been a judge. I have no talent, you do have to have talent to be able to compete. Being a judge is wonderful because you really get bribes. I got little bottles of champagne and shoulder rubs, but you have to buy your seat, and then the woman who&#8217;s being the history&#8212;our professor who&#8217;s doing the academic part, she said, &#8216;You won&#8217;t be able to vote for Justin.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Oh yes I can vote!&#8217;, &#8216;You mean you can vote before seeing?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Of course it&#8217;s corrupt!&#8217; we said vote early often. So that&#8217;s a Durham thing, and I feel like that&#8217;s what has happened now, is that we&#8217;re&#8212;the LGBT community is woven into Durham&#8217;s quilt, and we&#8217;re part of the community. So the march has changed in that respect too, it&#8217;s not the only thing we have, we have other things. And who knows&#8212;that&#8217;s just the one, the little community that I&#8217;ve been involved with. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the&#8212;I think that&#8217;s a nice rounding of where we are today.        IS: Yeah it seems like the two things have a similar trend. You know&#8212;        JA: You&#8217;ll have to google beaver queen pageant in Durham, to see some of the contestants, they&#8217;re pretty amazing.        IS: Yeah, more integrated with a larger part of the community.        JA: Yeah, yeah. I know one of my friends said, &#8216;It&#8217;s really important for me to have LGBT rights.&#8217; She&#8217;s a big environmentalist, she said, &#8216;You know, but I really want to be working on these other issues. I don&#8217;t want to have to fighting for my basic civil rights all the time.&#8217; And I think a lot of LGBT people feel like now that they can do that, and they are working, they are going to Moral Mondays, and they are working for, to protect voting rights, and to help end poverty in Durham and that kind of thing. I hope we&#8217;re not complacent, I hope that we don&#8217;t see a roll back on gay rights, but the whole thing&#8212;that the marriage thing might be proved unconstitutional is mind-boggling to me. I can hardly believe it. I will have to go back and say, the first march we went to, I guess not the first, but one of them, the Great March in [19]87, was&#8212;was that it? Was gays in the military, or maybe that was the [19]93 one&#8230;and for pacifists, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t want anybody in the military, so a bunch of us marched with the Radical Fairies, who were wearing little frocks saying, &#8216;We don&#8217;t want to be in the army!&#8217; so that was fun. And then the other one, gay marriage, I have some questions, because for the civil rights parts of it, yes, but I think marriage ought to be for religious people and civil unions ought to be what the governments are involved with. Everybody would get a civil union and that would be how you get your tax and your social security and all those kind of benefits. But if you want a religious ceremony, you have a marriage. They should be completely divorced. Marriage is a religious thing, and so this whole thing about gay marriage is like, well it&#8217;s going to be so entwined that--.        IS: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point actually, because, yeah--.        JA: That&#8217;s how other countries do it.        IS: Yeah it makes a lot more sense.         JA: And that way the religious people don&#8217;t get their panties in a wad because they keep marriage and everybody else has to do a civil inion. One of my straight neighbors, in our little cul de sac, she and her husband went down to the JP and got married there, and she said, it really should have been a civil union because we had nothing to do with religion. And that&#8217;s kind of like, yeah.        IS: How did you feel the community reacted, or at least the people that you know, to Amendment One. What was the response to that?        JA: Oh, it&#8212;I did not anticipate how deeply it felt to me, it affected me&#8212;but the Saturday before the actual vote, I was at the farmer&#8217;s market talking to my gay farmer friends, Ben and Noah [of] Fickle Creek [Farm], I don&#8217;t know if you know them. I burst into tears, it was really really tough. You know, you don&#8217;t vote one someone&#8217;s civil rights, and that&#8217;s what it felt like it was. One woman in our neighborhood, a straight woman in our neighborhood, [organized our neighbors and] people gathered in different places and at Motorco, and everyone had the same t-shirts and took pictures and put them on the internet&#8212;she organized our neighborhood, and almost everybody that was in town [from] our neighborhood went there and had their pictures [against] Amendment One, and almost everyone had a sign in their yard, so that was really affirming. Some of my friends had to quit the gym they were going to, which they liked, because they were not that way. I know two people who cut off their family and still are not in touch with their family because they supported Amendment One, so it was really personal. And I think that the Christians, the so-called Christians that were so for it, they don&#8217;t realize the collateral damage that has happened. So that was really hard. I was at Motorco and that whole Geer Street Garden area afterwards and the bands were there, and you would have thought we won, because even though we lost, Durham was so united. There was People&#8217;s Alliance, the liberal organization, was so strong for it, so many of the churches&#8212;Reverend Barbara in the NAACP. So you know, it was, on whole, it was a very affirming thing, even though it was very rough that we lost so badly. I didn&#8217;t think we were going to lose so badly, I thought it was going to be way closer. So that was something that was shocking to me.         IS: But it still did illuminate the communities that are&#8212;        JA: Yeah, where the universities are, it&#8217;s so clear how important education is. It really is. So what was your, I want to hear, how did you feel about it, since you&#8217;re so young?        IS: About Amendment One?        JA: Yeah were you involved with it very much?        IS: I was not involved. I mean, me and my family went and voted.  JA: As a group? Oh that&#8217;s very cool.  IS: Yeah, that was a great moment. I didn&#8217;t really participate a whole lot outside of that.        JA: I didn&#8217;t either,  and a lot of people I know were doing calling, and I hate calling people, I hate when people call me so I don&#8217;t do phone stuff. But I wore my button and I had it on my billfold, because I figured anytime I showed my billfold somebody would ask me about it. But you know, we&#8217;re here so it really didn&#8217;t matter that much. We should have gone to Roxboro or something if we were trying to make a difference.        IS: Right, yeah. I feel like everybody&#8217;s kind of on the same side in these areas.         JA: Yeah you do feel that way. But when I burst into tears at the Farmer&#8217;s Market,  I though, god this is really&#8212;I never cry in public&#8212;I said this is really, because he asked me how I was feeling about the amendment and I was like, &#8220;Ahh!&#8221; But yeah, it was a very interesting thing, it really was. I think that the King quote, that the arc of justice is forward, it may be slow, but the arc is in a forward direction, is true. And I think about Nazi Germany and how things were so good for gay men, at least before Hitler came in, and it scares me. Because if anybody does want to round up people it sure will be easy now because all of us that are out, it&#8217;s very easy to locate who we are now. So that&#8217;s, I think one reason that it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to have a little flavor of political&#8212;to be involved in coalitions. To be sure that we are working with other people and not just single issue folks.        IS: Do you think that maybe if the pride parades were still a little more politically motivated that it would change, change anything in terms of recent legislature?        JA: I don&#8217;t know if you could go back to that. I think it&#8217;s important that LGBT individuals and organizations be involved in things like Moral Monday and other political movements, Democratic Party, People&#8217;s Alliance, whatever. Green movement, whatever they are&#8212;as out LGBT people. When there is something like Amendment One, put energy into that. I guess I was disappointed because I thought there was going to be some kind of ongoing political organization, and I don&#8217;t think there one from Amendment One. And it may be because of everything that was happening in Raleigh sucked all the energy that way. But I think we have to watch&#8212;seeing what happened to the voting rights, could happen to voting rights here in North Carolina, who knows how that&#8217;s going to shake out. That kind of thing makes me think we do have to be aware, but I don&#8217;t think the march could ever go back to being a civil rights march, I don&#8217;t know. Unless things start really changing, I think its niche now is a celebration. Which is okay. And perhaps&#8212;I know one person told me it was the only time they ever felt like they could walk holding hands with their partner. That&#8217;s a wonderful thing to have that space, for that weekend.        IS: Yeah, that seems like the point, the end goal at least.        JA: Yeah.        IS: Would you say that&#8212;you mentioned a lot of political organizations that were going on in the [19]80s and [19]70s, do you feel like the climate is still like that here now? &#8211;in terms of the amount of activity?        JA: Gosh.         IS: Because we were talking about how a lot of things have seemed to shift towards more of like, integrating everybody, more of a community celebration, fun type of thing, as opposed to smaller organizations.        JA: Right. I think so. I think that a lot of people my age are just tired, and we don&#8217;t do a lot of organizing other than our jobs. The Marry Durham thing, you know there was a Marry Durham celebration a couple of years ago, where people had vows to marry Durham, shop locally, support artists, clean up the streets, support schools. It was pretty cool. But that was organized by a mixed straight-gay group, and it was a lot of, again it was a&#8212;some of the Beaver Queen people were involved with it. But that kind of thing, that spontaneous, pop-up event that involves lots of people in the community with the gay presence, that&#8217;s the direction I think we&#8217;re going, and I like that direction. There&#8217;s some pop-up things down&#8212;you should probably walk downtown, there&#8217;s some pop-up things with different art groups this week, getting ready for art walk. They&#8217;re making a giant Rubik&#8217;s cube and there&#8217;s some other weird things downtown, they&#8217;re doing a mural. So for organizations, most of the organizations that were involved then, except for People&#8217;s Alliance and the community on Black Affairs, the really gritty, the ones that are basically a political pack, I think they&#8217;re almost the only ones that are still in existence. I&#8217;m trying to think of any other, now War Resistors Leagues is located in other locations, there&#8217;s just not a chapter here. NOW is, I don&#8217;t know, I know there&#8217;s a NOW organization, but I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s involved with it anymore. So yeah, I think it is that in Durham, people are way more integrated, and I think if an organization had emerged, it would have been from Amendment One, and I don&#8217;t know if one did. I know a lot of people were involved in Obama. In fact I had a&#8212;it was Obama with a rainbow around it, there was some LGBT organizing around getting the vote out for Obama, both times. But it was in the context of the bigger campaign, so yeah. It&#8217;s another good question beside what happened in the five years between the two marches, is what is the, what will be the future of LGBT organizing or coalition building, and political involvement.        IS: And it seems a lot more integrated now, is what you&#8217;ve been saying.         JA: Absolutely. Which is good since we are a minority, we&#8217;re not going to ever do things by ourselves, we always have to be in coalition to have power.        IS: Definitely yeah. Well is there anything else you&#8217;d like to talk about?        JA: I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t have any more dates&#8230;specific stuff.        IS: Oh no, no problem        JA: Yeah. I think that&#8217;s it.        IS: Alright well great. Thanks for talking to me.        JA: Thank you this has been very fun, Ian, let me go give you that other&#8212;
