ROBIN PAYNE: This is an interview with Florence Glasser in her home in  Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on Tuesday, July 11th, 2006. Okay, Florry, if you could  begin just by please stating your date and place of birth.  FLORENCE GLASSER: I was born in 1931 in Baltimore, Maryland, and lived  there through my elementary school, high school years. I went to Goucher College on  completion of high school, and went there for two years. At the end of my sophomore  year I got married which is something we did in the &#8216;50s. In 1950 I got married to  Richard Glasser. Unlike many women of the time I decided not to drop out of school but  rather to complete my college education. I&#8217;m very thankful at this point that I did that.  RP: And what was it that you were studying at, did you say Goucher College?  FG: I knew that I wanted to be a school teacher, however, I did not want to take  education courses not thinking that they were academically challenging, and so I became  a history major.  RP: Okay.  FG: I did minor, I worked in education as a minor but took most of those  education courses in the summer. Since I was in Baltimore I could go to Johns Hopkins  and take some of the education courses. I finished college in 1952. At that time my  husband decided he wanted to go back to graduate school, and as is the way, as was the  way in those days, I helped put him through five years of graduate school. During those  years I worked as a school teacher in Baltimore County, Maryland. For five years I was  an elementary school teacher and became a demonstration teacher in my third year of  teaching. I finished five years of teaching in Baltimore County schools. At the time that  Florence Glasser 2  my husband earned his Ph.D. He accepted a position at the University of North Carolina  in the physiology department, and we moved to North Carolina at that point. Those were  interesting times.  I tried to get a job as a teacher in the Chapel Hill schools when we moved here in  1957. That was not to be. I was asked by the gentleman who interviewed me what I  though of Negro children going to school with white children, and I told him I didn&#8217;t  think that was a problem. At the time the Pearsall Plan was in effect. North Carolina  legislation had been passed that asked black families who thought that their children were  not receiving an adequate education to apply to the superintendent and ask that their  children be transferred to a white school. When I interviewed in 1957 only two African-  American children were enrolled in any white schools at all. These two had been at  Glenwood Elementary School, and clearly the superintendent was not pleased with that  situation and being forced to make that judgment. I can&#8217;t prove that that was the reason  that I didn&#8217;t get a job as a school teacher, but I did not, and went on to work in the  planetarium taking school groups through [clears throat], pardon me, to see their  installations and the (unintelligible), and so I worked in that way for a while.  I became a member of the League of Women Voters which turned out to be a fine  thing to do. There&#8217;s no better introduction to a community if you&#8217;re a newcomer than to  become a part of the League, so I did that. It was a good way for me to learn not just  about the community but organizing skills.  In 1961, sorry, in &#8216;59, I had my first child, so first child in &#8216;59, second child in  &#8216;61, third child in &#8216;65. I became an active participant in Parent Teachers Association and  school matters as well as being in the League of Women Voters. That pretty much  Florence Glasser 3  covers, I think, those years. I can get into a lot of what was going on in civil rights, but I  think that your interest may be more gender specific.  RP: Right. Although, you had mentioned you felt that one reason you perhaps  didn&#8217;t get a job in the Chapel Hill schools was because of your views on school  integration. Was the civil rights movement something you became involved in or were  interested in during this time?  FG: I was very involved in the civil rights movement. We actually moved to  Chapel Hill thinking we&#8217;d only stay a year. My husband signed a contract as an  instructor. We didn&#8217;t want to move to the racist south, but it was a fine little community,  and we soon discovered there were a lot of people in this community who believed as we  did that the schools should be integrated. We joined an organization to do just that, to  integrate the schools in Chapel Hill, and we became involved in that, and we did not  leave Chapel Hill. We stayed, decided to stay and fight rather than running away.  Those were interesting times. When my husband joined the medical school  faculty and the dental school faculty, he was a physiologist so he taught at both schools,  the medical school had just accepted, I think, their first or second black student, and in  the dental school when he went to introduce himself to the dean what he found were two  sets of water fountains, one marked white, one marked colored, two free standing signs,  one directing white patients in a certain way into the dental clinic, the other colored  patients. Both arrows were pointed in the same direction.  Those were the days when Harry Goldman was writing in the Carolina Israelite  about the ways to integrate the races, and he came up with some absolutely hilarious  ideas, some of which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read about. His columns in the Carolina Israelite  Florence Glasser 4  always brought a chuckle, and a lot of wisdom in cutting through some of the silliness  that was going on in those days.  So I got even more involved race issues when I worked for Howard Lee who  became the first African-American mayor of a majority white southern city, and I did his  precinct organization. It was a nonpartisan race. I was not yet at all partisan, but I  thought that his issues of social justice were important, and I worked hard to see that he  might become a mayor. At the time he campaigned it was on bringing water, and sewer,  and roads to the black community, the north side community. Those people paid taxes  but they did not have any of the services that most taxpayers enjoyed. Howard also  talked about the lack of public housing in north side. He was an extremely articulate and  attractive candidate, and in fact he won the election in 1969.  I went on later in 72 to work for his congressional campaign when he ran in the  second congressional district against L. H. Fountain. I decided at that time I would work  in the field to try to organize black voter registration, and I worked for six months north  of Hillsboro, North Carolina. Hillsboro is, after all, the center of Orange County, and  there is as much land north of Hillsboro as there is south. We don&#8217;t realize that here in  Chapel Hill. What I did was to use some of the skills and organization that I had tried out  in Howard&#8217;s mayoral campaign in black communities north of Chapel Hill.  Those were terrifying times. In fact, in 1969 I was part of Chapel Hillians who  went to the Orange County convention at the Hillsboro County Court House. The  democratic party was having a convention then, and the people who were standing in the  back of the court house were carrying guns in holsters and were members of the KKK,  and that&#8217;s who at the time was running the democratic party in Orange County. We had a  Florence Glasser 5  enough Chapel Hillians interested in county politics at that point to be able to out vote  those people and pretty much take over the democratic party in the county, and we did,  and we installed our own chairman.  In &#8216;72 when I worked north of Hillsboro that democratic chairman helped us to  get the first African-Americans appointed as democratic judges at the precinct places, and  we were able to very much change the numbers in terms of how many blacks were  registered and enrolled.  RP: Okay. So clearly you were very involved in civil rights activism throughout  the 1960s and 70s.  FG: Yes, very much involved. I got tired of standing with the fringe friends in  front of the post office on Franklin Street and decided it was time to stop being  nonpartisan and to join the democratic party. The League of Women Voters had taught  me when I was voter service chairman for them that the people who run the elections are  in fact appointed by the parties, and so I decided that was the time to change.  The other movement I was very involved in was anti-Vietnam War, and I became  in 1968 the co-chairman, it was still called co-chairman at that time, of North Carolina  Citizens for Eugene McCarthy. We were very active in that movement here in Chapel  Hill. Students were extremely active in anti-Vietnam rallies and marches. It was all of a  piece, you know. There was anti-war. There was pro-civil rights. All of that ferment  going on in the 60s was something we were very much a part of.  RP: So with all of these things kind of converging, and you said in part leading  you to become partisan and see yourself as a Democrat, were you also seeing yourself as  an activist during this time?  Florence Glasser 6  FG: I don&#8217;t know that I ever said I&#8217;m an activist at any point. It just happened. I  always was interested in history. I was reading about history. I needed to be a part of the  history that was evolving.  RP: Okay. So also during this time you mentioned you joined the League of  Women Voters.  FG: Well, the League of Women Voters was what happened when I came here in  &#8216;59. I joined the democratic party late in the 60s to become part of the decision making  of who the party candidate would be for president so we could stop the war.  RP: Okay.  FG: So the race issues, the civil rights issues. In 1965, I became part of an effort  by the town to open public accommodations, and we went to Washington to try to lobby  our senators, U.S. senators, Sam Ervin specifically, trying to get him to vote for the Civil  Rights Act. That was an interesting time, too, and that&#8217;s a whole other story, but there  were a number of us who went hoping that we would have some way to change his mind  which, unfortunately we couldn&#8217;t do. He believed that he was the constitutional expert in  the Senate, and his administrative aide wouldn&#8217;t let us get in to see him. He was not for  the Civil Rights Act. Later he was not for the Equal Rights Amendment either.  RP: So were there a lot of women involved in the same causes you were involved  in during this time?  FG: Both men and women were involved in the civil rights era. It was interesting  to me that later when we began thinking about feminism and gender that many of those  males who had been with us in the civil rights movement did not make the easy  translation and transition to work for rights for women. I guess Betty Friedan and her  Florence Glasser 7  book was, I think, a mobilizing call to women to see that relationship between pushing  for civil rights for African-Americans and pushing for civil rights for women in this  country.  I have a wonderful&#8212;I found a really wonderful picture that I think you might  like. Let&#8217;s see if I can find it. This is a picture. That&#8217;s me [points to woman in center of  photograph]. This is a picture of five of us at UNC at a panel discussing Betty Friedan&#8217;s  book. It was an interesting student sponsored panel, and each of these women was quite  active at the time. This is Patricia Stanford Hunt [second from left in photo] who became  the legislator in the house of representatives, the North Carolina House of  Representatives, later a judge. At the time she was still a school teacher, but then she  went through law school, and then took these other positions. This is Fran Tomlin [on  the far left in photo] who later became part of the Holtzhauser administration, a  Republican. Notice that we had Republican as well as Democratic women, all of whom  believed in this cause. Another Republican, Grace Rohrer [second from right in photo]  later became secretary of North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, and later  became my boss eventually in the North Carolina Department of Administration in the  Martin Administration. This is Shirley Marshall [far right in photo] who became county  commissioner in Orange County. So an interesting and very old picture that brought a  smile to my face when I found it.  RP: And so you said this is a panel discussion on Betty Friedan&#8217;s book?  FG: Yes, at UNC.  RP: Okay, and what was that like?  Florence Glasser 8  FG: A very, very interesting discussion. I remember talking about how important  that book was and how eye opening it was in terms of what opportunities were available  especially to college-trained women. That book let us all know what our potential was  and how limited we were in our choices, especially occupational choices. It made us all  believe that we were not alone in thinking that we were not fulfilling our potential.  RP: Right.  FG: I remember arguing, however, in the one place when I disagreed with  Friedan that she did not believe that&#8212;well, she believed that housework was fine but that  we were doing too much of it and more than we needed to do. We spent more time on  housework than was needed. But I do remember arguing that that should not be in the  same category as raising children, and that she seemed to equate child rearing with  dusting, and I thought these were two very different jobs.  RP: Right.  FG: She later came out, you know, with a second book which said something  similar to that, and then she was roundly criticized by feminists who didn&#8217;t think that she  should renege on that early philosophy. They thought that she had turned her back on  feminists. So it was an interesting, very, very interesting time.  I also remember that we decided to found something called the North Carolina  Women&#8217;s Political Caucus, and the person who was the prime mover was a woman  named Martha McKay. Martha at the time had been going to New York City and  working with Gloria Steinem and Bella Abzug and other feminists to launch a women&#8217;s  political caucus. It seemed to me that she had managed to put into action what all of us  were thinking because of the Friedan book.  Florence Glasser 9  She went to her friend Terry Sanford, who she had gone to UNC with, and she  asked him if she could borrow Page Auditorium to hold a conference for women to talk  about how we might get together and how we might organize to get the Equal Rights  Amendment passed. She had earlier been the women&#8217;s campaign organizer for Terry  Sanford&#8217;s bid for the governorship. Terry Sanford said, &#8220;Sure you can use Page  Auditorium.&#8221; Martha used all of her organizing skill, which were impressive, and all of  her contacts across the state and managed to bring together a thousand women in 1972,  and this is what pleased me the most. I have found for you a copy of that program of the  North Carolina Women&#8217;s Political Caucus, but I have to find it. Let&#8217;s see [looking  through album]. I saw it in here a little bit earlier. Give me a minute. Old family  pictures. Here it is.  RP: Oh, okay.  FG: Here it is. That, I think, is something I think you might want to have a copy  of.  RP: Yeah, absolutely.  FG: Martha had not only organized individual women but had gotten cosponsorship  from all kinds of women&#8217;s organizations, and they&#8217;re listed here. At some  point during this conference she railed at Sam Ervin for his obstinate refusal to accept the  Equal Rights Amendment, and threatened that she would run against him in the next  democratic primary if he didn&#8217;t change his ways. She got a standing ovation. Everyone  stood and screamed with delight at that threat. At this meeting district organizations were  formed for the North Carolina Women&#8217;s Political Caucus, and officers were chosen for  Florence Glasser 10  each of the congressional districts, so this was a powerful meeting and a powerful force at  the time.  It was later in 1976 that Martha came back from New York and said, &#8220;In New  York what they're doing is deciding that some women have gotten power already, and  they have formed a Women&#8217;s Forum. They formed a New York Women&#8217;s Forum, and  we need to form something in North Carolina along those same lines. We need to argue  for doors of opportunity to open for women, and we need to accept the fact that we have  power, and that we need to use that power.&#8221; She also talked about the fact that women,  especially southern women, were hesitant to use the word power, and were hesitant to get  into politics, and that we needed to take control of our own lives, and one way of doing it  was through the political process, so that we needed to run for office, and we needed to  get as many women who already held power to do what the men did which is instead of  an old boys&#8217; network, a new girls&#8217; network, a women&#8217;s network, a new old boys&#8217; network  that would especially link women who had power to one another. And because women  were so much more collegial than men we would use that network to help one another  move each one&#8217;s agenda forward so it would be a composite agenda for women, but there  would also be one-on-one help in moving other women&#8217;s agendas forward.  All of that, the North Carolina Women&#8217;s Forum began to happen in 1976. We  had a board. I was a convener of the North Carolina Women&#8217;s Forum. There were five  of us who met at Grace Roher&#8217;s office. At the time she was secretary of Cultural  Resources in the Holtzhauser administration in Raleigh. Five of us met in her offices and  came up with this idea of the North Carolina Women&#8217;s Forum. The Caucus was still in  existence, but the Forum was there to choose about a hundred women by invitation only,  Florence Glasser 11  whereas the Caucus you could simply join if you were interested in the movement. You  had to be invited to join the Women&#8217;s Forum. The North Carolina Women&#8217;s Forum  meets to this day and meets to this day so that has had a much longer life than the  Caucus. I think there are only two communities that have a Women&#8217;s Political Caucus  today.  RP: Okay. Before we talk about the Women&#8217;s Forum I&#8217;m just curious if by this  point in the 1970s when you&#8217;ve been participating in the political caucus and then helping  with the founding of the Women&#8217;s Forum, did you see yourself as a feminist by this  point?  FG: We laughed about the fact that nobody could use the word feminist because  there were women who really didn&#8217;t want to be considered feminist. There are some who  to this day see feminism, being a feminist, as a pejorative term. I have never had a  problem with that. I simply, when I&#8217;m asked to introduce myself do that, and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m  an unabashed feminist.&#8221; I don&#8217;t give any excuses for my views. I think anybody who&#8217;s  interested in human rights is a feminist by definition, so I have no problem with that.  When we used to meet as a women&#8217;s forum we would sit for the first few minutes  and go around the circle of those who were there and brag. It was called bragging time  because we had to get comfortable with talking about our own accomplishments. As  southern women we were told that that would be immodest, that what we should do is  talk about our husband&#8217;s accomplishments not our own. And even in the Women&#8217;s  Forum with a small number, all of those having reached some degree of distinction, even  with that, those women, there needed to be practice with bragging about success and  accomplishment. It was a sensitizing and challenging exercise.  Florence Glasser 12  RP: Why do you think it was that some women, and I&#8217;m assuming you mean  some of the women who were involved in the Women&#8217;s forum, were reluctant to see  what they were doing as feminism?  FG: I think they all knew that they were involved in feminism. We had lobbied  in the general assembly for the Equal Rights Amendment. We had begun to meet in  districts to see what could be done to elect women to local office. We&#8217;d begun to move  forward on running for office. I think there was a great deal of interest in moving women  forward and seeing that as our role. I don&#8217;t think that was a problem. It was this other  stuff. It was this feeling it immodest and not very womanly to brag that was the hang up.  RP: Okay. Earlier you mentioned that you thought for southern women in  particular this idea of trying to grab hold of power was especially kind of uncomforting.  Do you think that that kind of went along with these other things you&#8217;re talking about  some of the women feeling that they were being immodest?  FG: Women who were &#8220;ambitious&#8221; were thought of as unfeminine whether you  were ambitious in politics, or ambitious in gaining office, or ambitious in competing with  men it didn&#8217;t matter. It was not supposed to be your role. There were many women who  were still used to deferring to men. We were particularly interested in getting women to  think for themselves about voting and who to vote for. Often southern women would, in  fact, ask their husbands or be told by their husbands how to vote and who the candidates  should be. We certainly wanted to break out of that mold and think for ourselves.  There were issues too that we were very, very much involved in, the Equal Rights  Amendment being one. There were other issues. In those years property could not be  held by women. Divorce was a tricky business, and you could be left economically  Florence Glasser 13  strapped because there was no fair, equitable distribution of the wealth after a divorce.  There were many ways that women felt trapped in a marriage that wasn&#8217;t a good  marriage because they could not get a job if they divorced and left their husbands, so  there were many issues we were involved in and interested in. Social Security was one of  the issues I remember that we were aghast about because, as you know, the Social  Security System is set up with the presumption that a single earner, the man, is the one  who needs the earnings and his wife, who often had not worked, got short shrift when it  came to Social Security and retirement payments.  The other thing we were very interested in was training for good jobs. Women  were very much limited in terms of what kind of occupations they pursued. We were  interested in seeing more women get into good paying jobs instead of the poor paying  jobs, and we were interested in jobs that benefited society like teaching, and social work,  and nursing to be better paid. We saw occupational segregation, and the more women  there were in a particular job category the lower the salary was. The more men there  were in a particular occupation the higher the salary. So we became interested in  comparable work and studies that were done on that along those lines.  RP: Okay. One thing you mentioned was Betty Friedan&#8217;s book as something that  was really eye opening. Were there other things going on during this time that led you as  an individual to become particularly interested in these kinds of women&#8217;s issues you were  just outlining?  FG: I had grown up in a household where the roles between genders were clearly  demarcated. When I sat down at the dinner table with my mother and father, I had one  sibling but he was six years older and had already moved off when he was quite young,  Florence Glasser 14  but when I sat down at the dinner table with mother and father it was interesting to me  that my mother would talk to me about domestic topics. My father would talk about the  topics of the day. He was interested in newspapers. He would read his Time magazine.  He would not talk small talk. He left the child rearing to my mother, the disciplining to  my mother. He was in charge of going out and earning a paycheck and being what was  called a good provider while my mother was supposed to take care of the house and  home. I thought that that strict demarcation between the two genders was terrible, and it  made for a very uncomfortable situation for me. As an adolescent I had to make a choice  of which parent I would want to talk to or which one I could talk to, and there was never  a conversation for the three of us.  So it was interesting because much later after my state government experience  when I went to work for NC Equity, which was a private, nonprofit advocacy group for  women across the state of North Carolina, I started a center on work and family. What I  tried to do was figure out how many women I already knew, how many women had  already flooded into the workplace by that time, and the question was how to make the  workplace supportive of working women, and especially working women who had family  responsibilities. In other words, if you see work and family as a circle, and you put a  dividing line between it right down the middle, what I was trying to do was to erase that  dividing line and let people live an integrated life so they did not have to choose between  their work responsibility and their family responsibility. They could, in fact, manage  without guilt to do both. That was thought of as very idealistic I&#8217;m sure, but in fact it has,  I think, begun to happen.  Florence Glasser 15  My work at NC Equity was to work with and organize a council. The council was  made up of vice presidents for personnel from the forty biggest companies in North  Carolina, and those happened to be the forty best employers. In getting those forty  human resource professionals together what we decided to do was to let them do  information switching, teaching each other what personnel policies were most supportive  of working families.  At the time people thought of on-site child care as the only kind of family friendly  personnel policy. What I did was, in getting this council together, let them experiment,  create, and then inform others of which were the personnel policies that were the most  useful. By that I mean not only child care on site, but resource and referral programs for  both child care and eldercare. It meant flexible time schedules which is particularly what  was needed by both men and women who were raising families or who had elder care  responsibilities. It meant flexible benefits so that if you had two people working from a  single household they could use cafeteria style benefits to pick and choose, mix and  match the benefits that they and their families enjoyed. It meant employee assistance  programs that would help support them when they came through difficult times with their  family. There were all kinds of things.  I wrote about that pretty extensively and gave speeches about that pretty  extensively, but I think some of the best things that the Working Family Council at NC  Equity did was to sponsor conferences, and we invited personnel people from across the  state to come, and we were extremely successful in that. So over the course of about  eight years we were engaged in experimenting with changing, and hopefully for the  better, putting together personnel policies that allowed women to return to work after  Florence Glasser 16  childbirth more quickly so that it wasn&#8217;t an all or nothing, you had to be there forty, fifty  hours a week or nothing at all. We got that accomplished. We also accomplished a lot in  terms of flexibility which people with family responsibilities need. I think we did a  tremendous amount.  I will show you the names of the companies that took part in that. All of those  companies ended up, after the eight, nine year period with family friendly workplaces.  We managed to, in North Carolina, garner all kinds of recognition from Working  Mother&#8217;s Magazine that typically put together its most family friendly companies in the  United States. We were always among the big winners in terms of the states that had  workplaces that were supportive.  The other thing I did, was I had a contract when I was at NC Equity to make  government a model employer. I used Babcock Foundation money and got a contract  with the state of North Carolina to review what kinds of policies they already had that  were family friendly and to make recommendations about what could become new  personnel policies. That was interesting too. I did a lot of focus groups so I talked to lots  of employees, state employees, not just in Raleigh, but I had a contract to work in  Morganton and did focus groups with them, did focus groups with the disability services  unit of the department of human resources. I would ask typically, I would ask women  how they managed to balance their work and family responsibilities. That was absolutely  fascinating, the enormous pressures that these people were under, enormous guilt feelings  about not fulfilling their family responsibilities because of the obligations of work, and  they would come up with ideas and recommendations to change workplace policies to  Florence Glasser 17  make it better, to make it more possible for them not to feel that guilt and to be able to  fulfill those responsibilities. I think we accomplished a great deal.  RP: It definitely sounds like it.  FG: I left out the ten years that were probably professionally the most important  in my life, and those were the years that I was in state government. I worked in Jim  Hunt&#8217;s first two administrations, and then stayed on for two years with Governor  Martin&#8217;s Republican administration. In the Office of Policy and Planning in the North  Carolina Department of Administration the policies I was interested in were policies that  dealt with children, youth, and families, and figuring out what family policy was was  fascinating in those days. We were able in Policy and Planning&#8212;it was a wonderful  place to work because you got all the data from everywhere into a central place, and you  were able to look at it.  I did a book on the indicators of needs in North Carolina. I don&#8217;t know where that  is, but I could show it to you. Here. So it was children&#8217;s needs, but you can see that it  was broader than kids, and what I did was, and this was published by the state, I brought  together data users and looked particularly&#8212;for each set of data what I did was look at  the North Carolina&#8212;here are all the indicators, lots of them. I looked at the North  Carolina data for the whole state, and then I broke it out for each county, and rank  ordered each county on each indicator, so this was a large and difficult effort. I had a  graduate student helping me with this. But that&#8217;s something that we did, and I think it  indicated to me, first of all, that children were poor, that families, many families were  poor, were living in a state of the working poor. Infant mortality was one of the highest  Florence Glasser 18  in the country. That often related to poverty and poor water, sewer, public health  conditions.  But here was the big one which very much related to feminism. We had more  working mothers than any other state in the union, and when I realized that, you know,  there are lots of reasons of saying why is that true? Well, one of the reasons is because  men earned so little, and women had to go to work to support&#8212;.  END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A  BEGINNING OF TAPE 1, SIDE B  RP: This is side B of cassette one with Florence Glasser. Okay, Florry, we were  just talking about the high number of working women in North Carolina and some of the  problems that posed, so if you could continue with that.  FG: It&#8217;s a fascinating subject because when we found out that there were more  working mothers in North Carolina than any other state we asked why. One of the  reasons is because men earn so little. A second reason is that North Carolina was built  around tobacco farming at the time. Remember this was, I went into state government in  &#8216;77 and stayed ten years, so the three legs on the stool, economic stool of North Carolina  were tobacco, furniture, and textiles. There were many, many women working in the  mills, and we found that because of all that there were many, many women, especially  mothers, in the workforce. That was rather shocking to me, and I realized that it had  enormous implications in terms of the need for child care.  In &#8216;77 there was no state money in the North Carolina budget to help working  parents pay for their child care bills while they worked, and I also realized that the tax  breaks did not include breaks to help parents pay for their work related child care. I  Florence Glasser 19  remember working with Jim Hunt as governor in &#8216;77 to put together a package of policy  initiatives that he might put forward to the general assembly and to people across the  state that would address some of those problems.  I remember that in Winston-Salem in 1977 soon after I joined state government  he held a conference called Raising the New Generation, and that he gave an address to  four hundred people at Benton Convention Center who had come together for the  conference. He talked from that speech about poverty and infant mortality and needing  to do something about the terrible number of children who died before their first birthday.  He talked about the number of working women in North Carolina, and when he got to  that part about the implications for child care he stopped in the middle of the sentence  and said, &#8220;But I really think one of those parents ought to stay home.&#8221; He had, after all,  grown up in a household and his wife, who was a hard worker but worked on the farm,  and he knew his wife had raised their four kids, and she had been there to help with that.  What he didn&#8217;t know because of the circumstances he had grown up in is that life had  changed. He stopped mid-speech, singled me out in the audience, looked at me and said,  &#8220;But I really believe one of those parents needs to stay home,&#8221; and I had to think to  myself, what am I going to do about this?  I was asked by the press office to do the next speech because he really liked that  theme of raising up a new generation, and again it was infant mortality, it was child care,  it was reducing the number of drop outs in schools. Those were big issues. I had in there  the issue of supporting families.  I had been very much influenced by Carol Stack who was at Duke at the time at  the Institute of Policy Sciences and who had thought about family policy. As a good  Florence Glasser 20  anthropologist she thought about class, gender, family as important issues for her. She  had started the Center for the Study of the Family at Duke, and I was very much  influenced by her. The family policy people at the time were talking about family impact  statements, but she was an academic, and I was there in the real world trying to apply  some of that knowledge to family policy and figuring out what it was. It was all  interesting.  I was asked by the governmental relations office to do a conference for  Appalachian governors, so it was not just North Carolina now. We were spreading the  world to all of the Appalachian governors on these topics through the Appalachian  Regional Commission. Jim Hunt at the time chaired. It was a rotating chairmanship for  Appalachian governors, and he chaired the Appalachian Regional Commission. We did a  big conference in Asheville (NC) on these topics. The Appalachian Regional  Commission was smart enough to understand that there was a direct relationship between  economic development and child care, and so they were willing, and staff was able to  pull together, all the Appalachian Governors. They met in Asheville, and we had a fine  time of it discussing these topics. Infant mortality was horrible in Appalachia. We  discussed, certainly with experts, what could be done about that and what the  Appalachian Regional Commission could do about that.  We brought in the Vice President of the United States, Walter Mondale, who had  been the author of and sponsor of the Mondale-Brademas Child Care Bill as our speaker,  and I was able to influence the selection of that speaker which was great. We talked  about providing child care, reducing infant mortality, and raising healthy children, and  we talked about supporting families at that time, so this was an interesting program. I&#8217;ve  Florence Glasser 21  got a copy of the program if you would like to see it. Jack Watson came in also. Watson  was the secretary to the cabinet and special assistant to the president, so he and Mondale  were both excellent speakers, and we had truly wonderful conversations.  I think that the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the map of that group is  here, all learned and heard a great deal about this, and we had wonderful support from the  Carter administration on this set of issues. So I&#8217;ll leave that with you as well as leaving  with you the programs and the work papers. There is all of this here if you would like to  see it, and the Appalachia magazine that went out after the conference indicated that  these were topics, not just of prime interest to North Carolina but to Appalachian states.  So that&#8217;s the set if you want to see any of it.  RP: Okay. Thanks.  FG: The other thing that I did after that was to work on what the private sector  could do about child care. I wrote a book called Helping Working Parents: Child Care  Options for Business, and the governor published this. It had not my name but his on it,  State of North Carolina. That was 1981. We were able to send free copies of this across  the country, and thousands of these went out on request to child care people. What this  did was to begin saying that not just the pubic sector but the private sector can benefit  from offering these kinds of programs, whether it was company owned on site child care  or off site consortia model, whether it was voucher programs, vendor programs, and then  we got into other sorts of programs and personnel policies including what to do about  sick children. Do you force your employees to lie, or do you let them tell the truth?  What do you do in response to a parent who&#8217;s got a sick child?  Florence Glasser 22  Resource and referral became a really interesting option, and an interesting option  for many companies that didn&#8217;t want to get into the on site child care business, that  wasn&#8217;t their business, but did want to offer good advice and referral to parents who  needed that kind of help. And you&#8217;ll see here, &#8220;Sensitive Personnel Policies,&#8221; we were  just beginning to understand what some of those might be, whether it was flex time, or  job pairing, or compressed time, or staggered work hours, all of those, regular part-time  work with prorated fringe benefits, all of those are outlined here, so this was another  piece that we worked on pretty successfully. Governor Hunt also let me organize a  governor&#8217;s business roundtable, and employers got involved. This was very early in all  of this, but they began to be interested.  One of the things that I tried to do, whether it was in state government or in these  years when I worked in policy planning or later in NC Equity when I worked with the  work and family people, mostly private sector people, one of the things I really tried to do  was to find the research that could be used by personnel people to market internally these  kinds of possibilities.  The research indicated, and more and more research was done, and more and  more of it indicated that it was in the bottom line interest of the company to change their  workplace policies to make them more family friendly, and one of the things I did at  Equity was through the council member to recruit CEO&#8217;s, well known, large companies  across the state, CEO&#8217;s who would agree to write on the bottom line interest of the  company. We got a number of these published, and North Carolina Citizens for Business  and Industry, which looks like the state chamber of commerce, did publish in its own  house organ a couple of these articles. One was, I remember, by the CEO of RJR  Florence Glasser 23  Tobacco. One of these was the CEO of Bank of America. We did get some influential  businessmen to argue for family friendly benefits.  RP: All of this work that you&#8217;ve been talking about that you did in state politics  and later for NC Equity in terms of trying to resolve these kinds of tensions between  work and family, would you say that this work you were doing grew out of the North  Carolina Women&#8217;s Political Caucus and the Women&#8217;s Forum, your work with those  organizations or your concerns with women&#8217;s issues from earlier on?  FG: Well, they came out of my own personal experience which I&#8217;ve told you  about. They came out of my interest in children because I had started as a school teacher,  and the child care things were so related to that. It came out of the awakening in terms of  opportunities. It came out of a basic philosophy that I have and that I shared with Jim  Hunt, and Jim Hunt used to write speeches&#8212;give speeches that talked about burgeoning  out all that&#8217;s within you. That&#8217;s the philosophy. It&#8217;s a Charles Brantley Aycock quote,  and what it says is that every human being has potential, and that&#8217;s whether a man or a  woman, an adult or a child, and that that potential should be allowed to develop and be  realized. So it&#8217;s that basic philosophy rather than any single organization or experience.  RP: Okay. To what extent do you feel that feminism and things like the  Women&#8217;s Forum made it possible for women like you to continue this kind of work into  the &#8216;80s and even today?  FG: What Betty Friedan did and what the Women&#8217;s Caucus and Women&#8217;s Forum  did was to take women who had been isolated and who had not been talking about these  ideas, bring them together, allow a forum to happen, dialogs to happen, and to let women  explore those possibilities, the possibilities for women that could be realized. I think  Florence Glasser 24  we&#8217;ve just gone an enormous way in allowing women to think in creative and ambitious  ways about using their talent. In my day when I was growing up you were either a nurse,  a social worker, or a teacher.  Today there are just enormous numbers of opportunities available for women, but  if you look at the numbers it&#8217;s women who are the majority in the undergraduate schools.  Enormous numbers of women are now preparing themselves to be doctors and lawyers.  Maybe not so many engineers, but the other schools are full of women. It&#8217;s women who  realize that they&#8217;d better prepare themselves for a career because if they don&#8217;t they&#8217;re  going to be economically dependent, and so I think the whole mindset has changed.  In my day you went to college to find a husband. Today you go to college and get  a diploma which becomes a passport to a job and a career, and at different times in your  life, at different developmental stages in your life, you need to use talent, experience, and  judgment, and all of that can best happen if you&#8217;ve had many different kinds of  experiences yourself.  RP: Earlier you had mentioned the Equal Rights Amendment being one thing that  the Women&#8217;s Forum was interested in. Is that something that you became very involve  with, the effort to get the ERA ratified in North Carolina?  FG: I did. The North Carolina Women&#8217;s Forum really believed the Equal Rights  Amendment would pass in North Carolina. One of our members, Elizabeth Peterson, a  newly minted lawyer, just got a degree in law from Duke and a member of the Women&#8217;s  Forum, was asked by Martha McKay to come lobby for the amendment. I went with her  many a day and watched that debate in the North Carolina general assembly, an  absolutely fascinating debate.  Florence Glasser 25  There were all kind of ridiculous and outrageous claims made by the opponents of  the Equal Rights Amendment. We would have multi-sex bathrooms, heaven forbid.  Think of Calista Flockhart [laughing]. We would have women drafted into the army,  heaven forbid. Look at what is the case today, many women serving. All of those things  that were waved in front of us by the opponents were used to defeat the amendment.  I remember Sam Ervin having equal forums. Phyllis Schlafly would come down  to given testimony to the committee, constitutional amendment committee, in the North  Carolina general assembly. I remember her holding up this huge book called  Constitutional Jurisprudence, this was to impress those who were in the audience, and  talking about the dire things that would happen to the family, to society, to this country.  It would be the end of civilization as we knew it as far as she was concerned.  There&#8217;s a funny story about that. The weekend after I&#8217;d been to that meeting of  the general assembly I was called by a local reporter and asked whether I had seen and  heard Phyllis Schlafly, and I told her I had. I told her she was an Indiana woman with  that well scrubbed look, that she had interestingly enough become a lawyer, and therefore  probably was a feminist just without knowing it. What I told her was that she was a  demagogue, and in the paper there was this newspaper clipping, &#8220;Schlafly A Demi-God,&#8221;  but it was spelled, D-E-M-I hyphen God, and I had to figure out what to do about that.  Do you write a letter to the editor saying that&#8217;s not what I said, or do you just leave it  alone. It was interesting, interesting.  I have, let&#8217;s see, one of the things that I really tried to do was to get women  involved in public policy, not just politics, but if women didn&#8217;t feel eligible or competent  to run for office and serve, what could be done that would prepare them for that? The  Florence Glasser 26  difference being that when men are asked, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to choose you for a board,&#8221; they say  &#8220;thank you very much.&#8221; When you ask a woman to serve she says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m  eligible. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m prepared to do that.&#8221;  I came up with the idea of a talent bank, and I tried promoting talent banks with  the Women&#8217;s Political Caucus and with the Women&#8217;s Forum, and to this day I&#8217;m doing  talent banks at the county level now. What a talent bank does is to let women know  about all of the many appointed positions available. It puts them in the position of  getting themselves prepared and acquainted with the public policy issues the government  deals with, and it makes them feel more competent and become in fact more competent  so that they&#8217;re able to move through the ranks and go up to the next step. Talent banks, I  think, are extremely helpful and a good way to get more women to participate in public  policy and to make public policy.  I have a wonderful button that I&#8217;ll show you when you go through the kitchen. It  says, &#8220;Make policy, not coffee,&#8221; and that is the button that we all got in 1972 at the  Women&#8217;s Political Caucus. We laugh about the fact that we were the ones that always  brought coffee to men, and that what we wanted to do was to stop making coffee. Let the  men get the coffee themselves and begin to make public policy. It&#8217;s just ironic to me that  I ended up in the policy and planning shop of the North Carolina Department of  Administration. It&#8217;s fascinating.  I should also tell you, I&#8217;m skipping around here, the one area I didn&#8217;t talk to you  about was what I did with the Southern Governor&#8217;s Association and Southern Growth  Policies Board. I told you about Governor Hunt&#8217;s role with Appalachian Regional  Florence Glasser 27  Commission. He also played a key role as chair of what was called Southern Growth  Policies Board and the Southern Governor&#8217;s Association.  What we did was to take the issues that I mentioned to you, the policy issues on  children and families, into Southern Governors. He set up with the Southern Growth  Policies Board a board, and delegates from each of the southern states served on it, so  rather than calling it Raising A New Generation in North Carolina we called the project  Raising A New Generation in the South. I served as the chair of that board, and when  Riley, the governor of South Carolina, came in he appointed me to co-chair and continue  in that role so for two years I worked with southern states, again talking about the  problems of southern children and families. I think that we did a lot of sensitizing of  southern governors to all of these issues.  Again, it was a focus on mothers in the labor force, and we found that like North  Carolina southern states had more mothers in the labor force and needed child care  desperately. We had more problems with child health in the early years, with learning  and education in the south, with poverty. So all of that came out in publications, and the  conclusions were pretty much the same whether it was in southern states, or Appalachian  states, or in just North Carolina alone. There are unique ways that southern children and  families were not succeeding in life and not making advances that non-southern children  did, and it was all directly related to economics. Economic development and education  were paired for all of those governors.  We had a big conference in Puerto Rico in those years, the Southern Growth  Policies Board, Southern Governors sponsored it. The governor of Puerto Rico convened  the conference in San Juan. I remember to this day just an incredible amount of attention,  Florence Glasser 28  lots of media attention to those issues, lots of publicity about it. We did very well with  those issues. I remember having to give the keynote speech at that Puerto Rican  conference on this book that I&#8217;ve just shown you and the findings of it, so I think that we  did a good job of raising consciousness to not only what the problems were. Lots of  people were good at describing the problems, but what some recommended solutions  were.  At that conference I remember Bill Clinton sitting there as the governor of  Arkansas. I remember Governor Graham of Florida, Riley, of course, of South Carolina.  We had the Census South which went all the way from I think Maryland was the most  northern all the way down to Florida and across to the west somehow including Texas  and, of course, Puerto Rico. So I think we influenced quite a few people.  RP: That&#8217;s great. So you just mentioned raising consciousness among these  politicians about not just problems but solutions. Did you ever have a sense to what  extent you were also raising consciousness at more of community level?  FG: Yes. Some of the strategies and recommendations definitely were grass  roots oriented. If you look at Hunt&#8217;s Smart Start, which is his signature program for child  care, what you see is that, and this was done in his third and fourth terms mostly, it  required a task force at the county level of all of the stake holders, and it required that  they do a needs assessment at the community level, their county level, put together a  proposal for state funding, include both public and private sectors. Everybody was  included. It operated much like a foundation.  Smart Start includes, in fact, a public foundation board, and so that was the  design. It relied on the community to figure out its own needs. It relied on competitive  Florence Glasser 29  bidding much the way a foundation would request proposals, and everybody wanted to  get in on the act, and everybody wanted the financial rewards, and what it did was to  create an awareness at the community level of what the need was because those needs  had to be documented and a proposal submitted. So I think we were particularly good at  involving the local level on that. It also required a level of cooperation and collaboration  between agencies at the community level, and that was also extremely important.  One of the other things I did when I was in state government was to write  something called a children&#8217;s budget in which I identified all the sources of funding by  function, what purpose, and I think that helped. Here it is. I think this helped in figuring  out how to put streams of dollars together. This is an old, old book. We then sold this  idea to the National State Budget Officers, and they did a comparable piece, and we sold  the idea to the Children&#8217;s Defense Fund.  If you look here are the categories of function for spending, and then we looked at  of this, what percentage of total dollars were spent on kids, young children, and so the  focus was always on kids but on investments in young children to get them ready for  school, and ready to learn, and ready to succeed, so I think that this was useful simply as  a way, and especially in the child care arena, of figuring out&#8212;here we go. You can see  these were really limited dollars spent, and the federal dollars by far outweighed the state  dollars. These state dollars were match money for child care especially for abused,  neglected children who were in the care of social services, so child care was looked upon  as a child welfare service rather than a service that helped their working parents. That  was a totally different focus.  RP: Um-hum. Right.  Florence Glasser 30  FG: This, I think, really did help us understand that if we were to do this job we  would need an infusion of state dollars, and so if you look at this as your benchmark and  look at the dollars put into child care by the State of North Carolina today you&#8217;ll be able  to see what&#8217;s happened.  RP: Right. So looking back would you say at this stage, you know, you&#8217;re doing  all of this work about child care, and work, and family. Was that something you saw as  probably the biggest problem facing women, resolving this tension between work and  family?  FG: No, certainly not. The child care issue was one of many issues. I think the  economics for women was certainly the biggest issue. They simply did not have enough  money to make them financially, economically viable. They were still looked at as a  secondary source of income, but lack of equal pay for equal work is something that  especially was focused on in a conference the Department of Administration did. I  worked simply as many staff members on that conference.  The woman who put that conference together is now the president of Peace  College [Raleigh]. Her name is Laura Bingham, and she, I think, did a terrific job  working with the secretary of administration at the time, Jane Patterson. They did a  terrific job on pulling together women from across the state, men too, and the conference  was on women and girls and the economy. So all of the economic issues, whether it was  lack of job opportunities, lack of job training, equal pay problems, comparable work  problems, all of those surfaced, and that was an interesting conference that certainly  highlighted the problems that women had economically.  RP: And do you see that as a problem that continues today?  Florence Glasser 31  FG: Sure. I think we are still trying to take baby steps on that issue. My  daughter, I have one daughter who&#8217;s a doctor and one daughter who&#8217;s a nurse, but the  nurse who works here is constantly overburdened with too much work. There are too few  nurses. It&#8217;s a dramatic, terrible shortage of nurses. We have a dramatic, terrible shortage  of teachers. We have a terrible shortage of social workers. They burn out in three years.  Teachers burn out very quickly too. These women who are really helping society and  helping the most needy people and the most vulnerable people in the society are so  underpaid and over worked, so you&#8217;ll see all kinds of efforts supposedly made to help  them out, but if you compare their salaries you&#8217;ll see that they&#8217;re simply not paid  according to what&#8212;you know, people who argue for free market say that there&#8217;s a  relationship between supply and demand. That is not the case with women who are in  female dominated occupations. They get paid on the basis of their gender.  RP: Right. So although this continues to be a struggle, these economic problems,  what would you say are some of the most important accomplishments the modern  women&#8217;s movement made?  FG: Well, I think there are some accomplishments. We have certainly seen an  increase in the number of women who serve in the North Carolina general assembly, but  still the percentages compared to their percentages in the population are very small. I  can&#8217;t just blame that on obstacles imposed from outside. It&#8217;s partly from women  themselves not feeling adequate to the job. It&#8217;s partly from the problems of family  responsibility. So those issues remain with us.  In these challenging times it is certainly not an employee&#8217;s market either, and  we&#8217;re seeing cutbacks in benefits. I think probably today we have a tougher economy for  Florence Glasser 32  the employee than we did in the years I&#8217;ve been talking about. I think it is a very tough  time. Women are afraid of losing their jobs. They&#8217;re afraid of asking for time off for  family leave. They&#8217;re afraid they may not get back into a job they would like to have  because of all the outsourcing that is going on.  These are tough times, too, for women who want to get training. Education has  become more costly, and the number of subsidies has certainly not kept up. The role of  the federal government in helping with loans has taken a very negative turn as Pell Grants  get cut back. I think it&#8217;s a difficult time for people just starting out to get themselves  launched.  RP: So based on all the work you&#8217;ve done in activism, in politics, all these things  you&#8217;ve been working on, do you have any sort of suggestions for what direction you  think we should head in today of trying to get some sort of gender equality?  FG: I think we have to just keep on keeping on. We do the best we can in the  circumstances. The group that has impressed me the most in North Carolina is a group  called Lillian&#8217;s List, and you&#8217;ll talk to Jan Allen about the success she&#8217;s made. Part of  the problem has been not having sufficient funds to run a campaign. Martha McKay said,  &#8220;Money is the mother&#8217;s milk of politics,&#8221; and that is exactly right. If a woman doesn&#8217;t  have her own resources to put into an expensive campaign to challenge an incumbent  today she&#8217;s not able to run. So Lillian&#8217;s List is an effort to try to help offset that obstacle.  I think it&#8217;s been an incredibly successful effort.  RP: What would you say is the most important thing for us to remember about  the women&#8217;s movement?  Florence Glasser 33  FG: Oh, I think we should see it as a human rights movement. I think it is linked  in many ways to opening doors for minorities. I think it&#8217;s a social justice issue. I think  there is no question but that we have a bias. This is my husband, Richard Glasser.  RP: Hi, nice to meet you.  FG: This is Robin.  RICHARD GLASSER: Hello.  RP: Hi.  RG: It&#8217;s good to meet you.  RP: You, too.  FG: I forgot where I was going with that. Give me your question again.  RP: You were talking about seeing the women&#8217;s movement as a human rights  movement.  FG: As a human rights issue, as a political issue. I really think that unless  women are well represented in the halls of government, both in legislative, executive, and  judicial branches, that the people who are the policy makers lack the background and  experience to make wise decisions. The priorities in terms of topics that need to be  addressed are different for men and for women because of their life experience, so we  need to have representatives who represent the population. Women are, after all, fiftytwo  percent of the population.  RP: Right.  FG: So we still continue to struggle to make our representatives more  representative of the population.  Florence Glasser 34  RP: Okay. Those are pretty much all of my questions. Is there anything else you  want to make sure we add or cover?  FG: I talked your ear off. Oh, no. I think I&#8217;ve talked your ear off. You&#8217;re  welcome to whatever here you would like to have.  RP: Thank you so much for talking with me. It&#8217;s been very helpful.  FG: Well, I jumped all around the place so if you need anything from here you&#8217;re  welcome to it.  RP: Okay.
