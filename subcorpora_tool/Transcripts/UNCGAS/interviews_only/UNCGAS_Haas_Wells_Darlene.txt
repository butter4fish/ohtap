JH: I wanted to go back a little bit and just talk about&#8230;you know, I have this sense, and   you had also said that you began with women&#8217;s issues very early on&#8230;probably in the   early seventies. Is that&#8230;     DHW: Mmm, hmm.     JH: So, I&#8217;m curious about the environment you were raised in, how you perceived   women&#8217;s roles as you were growing up&#8230;and how did that shape you&#8217;re moving into&#8230;     10         Janet Hoshour     DHW: Yeah, that&#8217;s curious. I was the youngest of nine&#8230;and my parents, my family was   of fundamentalist Christian kind of background. So, very traditional roles, I was raised in.   I think the, the one interesting aspect was that my mother was very interested in all of us   getting an education. It was extremely important to her. And so I know that that   influenced a drive for me as well as everybody else. And my older sisters, my older sister   had gone through a divorce and went back to school and got a graduate degree and got a   job in elementary school counseling. And so, you know, and she&#8217;s twenty years older   than me, so she was certainly an older role model who presented you can get through you   know, tough times, and support yourself and your family, which she did. And my other   sister who was a little younger than that, she, she also went back to school after she had   her children and got a teaching degree and taught kindergarten. So, I think that that even   though I had a very traditional upbringing as far as male female roles, I also had, you   know, those two role models&#8230;and&#8230;I think that I had the good fortune of marrying a   man who did not have a stringent, traditional, conservative, you know&#8230;expectations.   And so, I said, you know, I&#8217;m really feeling a need to make more connections with   women and this is, I&#8217;m going to be out every Tuesday night with this group&#8230;he was   there with the kids. And he was involved as a parent in a way that at that time not that   many men were doing. So, you know, it&#8217;s a combination of, you know, that relationship   also which was, one that had a lot of flexibility&#8230;and respect and consideration. So,   how&#8230;I don&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t really pinpoint was happened in terms of my being interested in   women&#8217;s issues, but I think it surrounded my own struggles to find myself through, you   know, going back to school and trying to find a job, and trying to figure out, you know,   where I fit it and what I could do&#8230;other than being a mom in the South, which I felt I     11         Janet Hoshour     did, you know, I had a great time doing those two things and felt quite successful doing   those, because I was playing both of those roles, but I wanted more and I wanted to&#8230;be   out there. And so, that&#8217;s, I guess, I guess I just started talking with other women who   were moms and that&#8217;s just how it kind of started. We started spreading out and listening   and finding out what was going on. And I remember literally reading the first MS   Magazine and just thinking I&#8217;d died and gone to heaven [laughs]. All that information   right there just about women and women&#8217;s rights and women&#8217;s needs. That was really, it   was really an exciting time&#8230;as I recall.     JH: you talked about your older sisters being role models. Are there other role models   that you would identify as&#8230;helping you on your path?     DHW: Probably some instructors in college. Definitely. You know, people who&#8230;gave   me a lot of , helped me build my self-confidence. Because I was a very shy, not a   confident young person. The background I came from&#8230;I was very quiet. Anyhow   [laughter]&#8230;during my academic pursuits, you know, getting a lot of positive feedback   along the way. I think that those were definitely people who were important to me. And   certainly all the, all the women instructors that I worked with at Goddard College, they   were all feminists, and they were all just&#8230;they were gang busters, they did all kinds of   cool stuff. And were, you know, real supportive and really helped us move ahead, in   whatever direction we wanted to go in. Locally&#8230; I was aware of, I became aware of   some woman who were active locally. Like Miriam who&#8217;s mentioned in that [points to     12         Janet Hoshour     copy of the web article &#8220;The First Twenty Years&#8221; from The Women&#8217;s Center webpage].   And Janet Palm and Connie Renz.     JH: When you talked about that&#8230;Don or Donald, which does&#8230;     DHW: Don     JH: &#8230;the role that he played, you know, that allowed you, that you had a more   contemporary, like in terms, that you had a more contemporary relationship and attitudes   towards family life and how children are raised. Were you in a social circle that   supported that, so that he had contemporaries among your friend where the men, other   men were playing the same types of roles?     DHW: Yeah, I would say so. We moved here in nineteen-seventy&#8230;nineteen-sixty-nine to   be involved with Carolina Friends School. And it was a school, a Quaker school. I don&#8217;t   know if you are familiar with it.     JH: Mmm, hmmm.     DHW: Anyway, it was founded on the desire to&#8230;have an integrated school at a time   when integration was not so, and it was a couple of years old when we moved here and I   taught kindergarten and he, and Don, started as head of the, developing the middle school   and then he was Principal of the school following that. So, yeah, I mean I would say the     13         Janet Hoshour     majority of our peers were at that same stage of really looking roles &#8211; male and female   roles &#8211; and that sharing responsibilities of family and&#8230;we knew single people. We   interacted with single people, too who didn&#8217;t have children who, you know, became a   part of our lives. And they, often they were men &#8211; they weren&#8217;t all women, by any means.   We had you know, both friends in and out of our home.     So, I always say that there was a lot of openness amongst the folks that we hung out with   at that time. And a lot of discussions, you know. It wasn&#8217;t all calm and easy-going and   beautiful [laughter]. It was open. And it was honest. And that&#8217;s what seemed to work for   a lot of us.     This is a fairly typical excerpt where I found that opening a work-related topic elicited   informational responses with little personal exploration or reflection and I personally   had minimal success in trying to broaden or deepen the conversation. In addition, her   work history was not addressed chronologically and I found we were often circling. As   a result, I kept envisioning a kind of interview cul-de-sac.     JH: What year did you finish your MSW?     DHW: I think it was nineteen seventy nine.     14         Janet Hoshour     JH: Through your graduate work, according to this Herstory on the Women&#8217;s Center web   page, you were working with displaced homemakers in Roxboro. Can you talk about   that?     DHW: I can talk about that, but that was actually my first job out of, after I completed my   degree. I think I finished in May or something and got this job and&#8230;August, most likely.   That program, that the umbrella for that program was the North Carolina Council on   Women. And they had received a grant to set up these satellite centers around the State to   work with displaced homemakers. And the grant was a federal grant called SETA &#8211; I   cant&#8217; tell you what that stands for now, but that&#8217;s what it was &#8211; federal money that went   through the State to the Council and then that&#8230;organization set up the small satellites   around the State. So, I went to the one in Roxboro, which is, yeah it&#8217;s pretty rural &#8211;   there&#8217;s a town there of course&#8230;the environment all around it was quite rural, quite   conservative. And the format of the program [Displaced Homemakers Project], project,   uh was a six week program, where women would come in who were single, single moms,   or&#8230;separated or divorced&#8230;or widowed. Those were the, that was what was considered   displaced homemakers at that time.     And um, so the, there was a personal approach &#8211; confidence building, group building, and   then there was the&#8230;career or education focus that also, you know, what do you want to   do and how do you go about getting there. Teaching and job interviewing skills or if they   wanted to back to school, you know, what were the steps to take to get to a community   college or in some cases, quite a few cases, actually, to finish high school. There was a     15         Janet Hoshour     very good community college nearby there called Piedmont Tech, who worked with them   quite a bit. And we worked with all the local&#8230;Employment Security Commission, and   all the local&#8230;and the social services.     And then developed all the support groups to help these women to find ways to get where   they wanted to go. And it was really, it was really exciting and interesting to see what   would happen. Each group, I&#8217;m trying to think, remember, I think the smallest was   maybe a group of eight and the largest was maybe fifteen. It was a real small group   dynamic thing and it was like going to school. They came at nine, eight-thirty or nine in   the morning until four in the afternoon. So, it was a real intense&#8230;[laughs]&#8230;get your act   together kind of program. And I&#8217;m not sure exactly how many groups I worked with, but   the funding ran out, of course, because Reagan came in as President and that was the end   of all that. So, I believe I was there for a year and a half&#8230;I think, I know it was short of   two years, and that was that.     JH: Do you think that was a particular time period that&#8230;you know, that things were   going on that made that necessary, that kind of program necessary, a certain climate for   women?     DHW: Oh yeah, it think that the&#8230;especially in rural areas, I mean, North Carolina in   general, the South in general, there, really, I mean women were still considered property,   basically. And I mean there really, women, the awareness of having rights and being able   to support yourself, for example, was really quite new. And&#8230;I think&#8230;and I think many     16         Janet Hoshour     of them might have stayed in abusive relationships for a long time. That was also very   common in that area in those days. I know it&#8217;s still common, of course. Not in the same   way. Yeah, I mean it was, there were, it just was not acceptable for, I mean even women   going out to work was not, was a kind of new concept. So, making resources available   and support available to women in those situations was&#8230;very crucial. And you know, it   would have been great if it continued and grown cause there&#8217;s a lot of ways it could have   grown, but&#8230;it was a start.     Later in the interview, I return to the topic of the Displaced Homemakers Project to try   and get a bit further into social conditions.     JH: To get back for a moment, I&#8217;m just curious. With the displaced homemakers you   were working with in Roxboro. I guess I&#8217;d just like to explore that a little bit further as   far as how did the women do with this new information? With this new way of being? It   was so very revolutionary for that time, and especially for this area. How successful was   it for them, for their families [unintelligible] supporting what they were doing? Can you   say just a bit about what you observed?     DHW: I think that for a lot of them there was a real&#8230;the new self-awareness and the   building self-confidence that they experienced from going to this program&#8230;was a   positive impact on their families with their children and so forth. But the others, I think,   like their moms or their dads -people like that -probably weren&#8217;t all that supportive.     17         Janet Hoshour     I don&#8217;t recall hearing any horror stories about family reaction to what they were doing.   And in terms of their actual success, you know, they&#8217;re, I do not, I can&#8217;t come up with   what the percentage rate was of those who got jobs, stuck with them, or went to school   and stuck with that. I&#8217;m sure there was a reasonable attrition rate, that just&#8230;it was a drop   in the bucket. It helps&#8230;they were, they were paid a small stipend to go this program.   Yeah. Or maybe it was child care. I think they were given, they were&#8230;there was support   for child care in the program. I believe that&#8217;s what it was.     JH: So a well-designed program.     DHW: Mmm, hmmm.     JH: I was just trying to get more of the overall sense of it&#8230;it seems that you know, doing   those kinds of initiatives right now, it&#8217;s a part of people&#8217;s mental furniture even though   they haven&#8217;t experienced it, it&#8217;s still in our society, but at the time it wasn&#8217;t so I was just   kind of curious about you know&#8230;how much they struggled both personally and with   family members. I&#8217;m wondering if there was a sense of that.     DHW: The other thing I remember about it was the&#8230;the&#8230;collective sense &#8211; the group   identity that formed with each of those groups. And they would want to have reunions   afterward and get together. And when the program was being shut down, you know, we   had one big get together at my house. I lived in Durham at that time and they all   carpooled and brought food and everything. And we had one big afternoon party outside     18         Janet Hoshour     where a lot of them came to enjoy it. And there again that, the women together as a group   -not to sew or knit, or do church work &#8211; but to support each other and to&#8230;you know,   increase their ability to stand up for themselves. That was very unusual&#8230;for that time   and that place.     That was just an exciting thing to do.     This area of the transcript reflects limitations that occur quite often in the interview.   For instance, my research indicated that Darlene had been fairly proactive in legal   rights issues in more than one of her positions, yet I elicited no passion or enthusiasm   in her discussion of her efforts in this area. I felt that Darlene tended not to explore   her own thoughts when answering questions, so answers tended to seem very straight   forward without personal attachment or reflection. And I had trouble finding the topics   that would animate her conversation.     JH: &#8230;and then there was, you started the legal aid program, or were heavily involved in   the legal aid program at the Center [The Women&#8217;s Center]? Is that right?     DHW: We had, when I came there, there were two, they called them resource books and I   know that one was lawyers. It was very small at that point and not being&#8230;I don&#8217;t think I   instigated it, as kicked it up a notch and got more lawyers involved in committing to give   some time to provide information to women who had questions.     19         Janet Hoshour     Was that a time period, I know the late seventies that as women were divorcing that there   is very little power legally, and that custody issues&#8230;it wasn&#8217;t just natural that, from what   I understand is that it wasn&#8217;t natural for the child to go to the mother. That if the husband   decided, if he decided that he was the parent who should have custody, that the woman   had a much harder battle. Are those the types of things that&#8230;     DHW: We, there was a lot going on in the whole legal issues for women in divorce. And   separation. There were new laws that I think were coming in that&#8230;in terms   of&#8230;separation of property and all that kind of stuff. We had a number of symposiums on   that topic, on the very topic of women and the law. And you know, those were really   popular and very&#8230;a lot of women attended those, and so saw &#8230;so I mean, I don&#8217;t   remember the specific legal issues, but I know that it was a very hot topic and very new.   And also the fact that so many more people were getting divorced. The divorce rate was   really jumping at that time. Compared to what it had been. The legal resources and the   other was for counseling, I think. The other information and referral thing had, we had a   list of&#8230;people who, women who gave counseling.     JH: The legal rights program in Hillsborough&#8230;it says that you helped create that.     DHW: Again, I think that was something that came out of one of those workshops or   symposiums. And we really tried to do outreach to Hillsborough because we   knew&#8230;because it was&#8230;it was more, a lot more conservative than Chapel Hill&#8230;[laughs]     20         Janet Hoshour     at that time. And I think what we did was connect with, make sure that we had   connections with lawyers in northern Orange [county], who would be willing to give their   time and give&#8230;not advice, but information, legal information to women. I can&#8217;t   remember if we did a special phone line, I don&#8217;t think cause...they were still the same   then. But I know, I&#8217;m quite positive that we had a workshop kind of program in   Hillsborough and did follow up with that. And I remember meeting with a number of   women&#8230;a group&#8230;like a minister, a social worker, a couple of folks from the   Hillsborough area, to try to establish something a little more concrete. I don&#8217;t think it   went very far. I mean that&#8217;s just my recollection that it didn&#8217;t go real far. But in the   beginning stages at the time that I lost my ability to all of that at the same time [laughter].
