Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m here today with Barbara Staggs. I am  working with the OSU Library on a project entitled Women of the  Oklahoma Legislature Past and Present. Barbara served in the House  from 1994 to 2006. Today is April 11, 2007, and we   re at the OSU-Tulsa  campus. Glad to have you here today.  Thank you for asking me.  Bring us up to date about where you are now, but start back to your  place of birth, hometown, parents, siblings, that type thing.  Okay. I was born in Hulbert,  Oklahoma . I happened to come from the  generation that did have people still born at home. I was born at my  grandmother   s house there and I lived in Hulbert probably about three  weeks. I don   t remember those first three weeks too well. (Laughs) My  mother and father were in Muskogee and they moved me to Muskogee  where their home was. I have lived in Muskogee all of my life except for  the short period when I was a superintendent in Tahlequah, and that was  just three years.  I had a house in Tahlequah because my two sons had gone to school  over there and we had bought a house for them. I lived there and then I  decided   no really, my husband decided, that I was missing out on an  opportunity to run for the legislature. I had decided that I wanted to run  for the legislature quite some time before that, and I probably have three  of the best cheerleaders in the whole state, male cheerleaders. He   husband  called and said,    Barbara, the fella who is the current  representative is not gonna run, and you would probably like to have an  open seat.    And so I quit my job in Tahlequah at the end of three years,  telling them that I was going home to write a book, which I   m still going  to do (Laughs) but I haven   t been as good at that as I should have been. I  5  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  just didn   t want to tell them that I was going to run for office until I was  really sure I was going to run for office. And Muskogee Public Schools  was between superintendents, and they asked me to help them out for  that period of time while I was making up my mind, only they didn   t  know I was making up my mind either. And I did. I worked for them  from the beginning of the fiscal year for the schools in July  1993 , and  then I stayed until January  1994  and kept saying,    Guys you   ve got to  hurry up, guys you   ve got to hurry up,    so I could start publicizing my  plan to run for the House. I didn   t want to do that while I was working  for Muskogee Public Schools.  I have no siblings. My parents are both dead now. My father died when  he was very young, forty-four, and my mother had Alzheimer   s and died  several years ago. In fact, she died my first session in the legislature. So  I don   t have a family. I have very few cousins, and my husband has only  a brother and a sister, so we have a very, very small family. When we   re  gone, that   ll be about the end of the Mastersons and the Staggs.  Were you interested in politics during college?  No.  No inkling to do it?  No. I was interested in being a teacher. My very favorite aunt, my  father   s sister   and she   s the only other one in my family still living.  She   s ninety-eight right now, and I   m going to last longer than even that.  I keep telling her that. Anyway, she was a wonderful teacher. In the  summertime when my mother needed a break from me   I think they  didn   t know what ADD  attention deficit disorder  was when I was  growing up, and so she needed to have a little break from me. I would  always go down and stay with them  aunt and uncle  because they had  no children. And I got wonderful attention while I was with them, but I  also learned a lot about teaching. She was a fantastic social studies  teacher, and I decided I wanted to be a teacher.  And then I had good teachers in college and good teachers in K through  12, only no K when I was growing up. All of them made good  impressions on me. I wanted to be like many of them, an attribute or two  from one and an attribute or two from the other, and so I made up my  mind to do that.  I was very active in educational groups like OEA  Oklahoma Education  Association  and I wasn   t very active in the NEA  National Education  Association . In OEA I was active and whenever we had meetings and  visited with our legislators, I decided I didn   t like the fact that we didn   t  6  Finchum  Staggs  have their attention. I   ve always been a responder to what I consider a  negative threat   if you tell me I can   t do something, I   m determined to  prove to you that I can. I just felt like people thought teachers would not  be good legislators, and so I thought what we need to do is send more  teachers to the legislature then maybe we can get something better done  with the teacher retirement system, which I was not able to do at all. The  entire time I was there we made only one positive change in the system.  So, when my husband said,    You need to come home if you   re gonna  run for the legislature,    I came home and I got a big surprise. The  incumbent decided he was going to run again, and by that time I   d  already told a lot of people about my plan to run and     and they had  made me feel good. They encouraged me and said,    You   d do a good  job.    So by the time we got down to the filing period, it was Barbara and  four males. I loved running. A young man who had run before shared  some of his wisdom with me. He said,    Barbara, you will love this.  You   re a people person, and you will love going door to door.    And I  thought,    Door to door sounds like a breeze.    I didn   t realize that would  be one of the most difficult things I did campaigning, but nevertheless it  was the most fun thing.  And I   m a very visual person. I   m not an auditory person, and  consequently I can tell you where just about everybody in my district  lived, but I might not be able to remember the conversation that I had  with them. The best thing was I could remember when I came there to  their house and how much fun I had visiting with them and I knew  where they lived.  Did you have to do as much each time you campaigned, each time you  ran?  I think it   s pretty obvious I like to talk, so I don   t think I ever cut down  very much. I might cut out some republicans and focus on the democrats  since I   m a democrat. However, I had a lot of republicans who were  supporters, too. While we have some yellow dog democrats and yellow  dog republicans in Muskogee, we have a lot of moderate republicans,  too, and my philosophy is pretty moderate.  I   m fiscally very conservative. My mother was German and I know how  to pinch pennies, and when it   s somebody else   s pennies, I pinch even  harder. So I was in line with them in lots of ways, and I had also been a  republican at one time in my life. My husband   s comment when I  decided that I was going to change back to Democrat was,    I   m glad  you   ve finally seen the light,    because he was always a democrat. But I  changed parties when I was in Tahlequah before I ever decided to run  for office. I changed because the senator there, Herb Rozell said,  7  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs     Barbara you are absolutely worthless to me as a republican. I need you,  and I need you to be a democrat.    I had definitely disagreed with  republicans on lots of education issues. So it was not difficult for me to  change, and I changed there and then I   ve been a democrat ever since.  Did you have the same campaign manager for the twelve years?  Yes, I did. I like to do a lot of things myself. It   s not that I can   t  delegate. The woman who was my campaign manager was a friend who  lived down the street and owned a flower business. I just asked her. I  needed someone on a piece of paper to be my campaign manager, and  she said,    Oh yeah,    she   d be happy to do that. So, yes, she was there  the whole time. I probably did not use her as much as many candidates  use theirs, but I was not an individual that had someone else running my  campaign and telling me what to do. As I said a few moments ago, I   m  very conservative with a dollar and I wasn   t interested in spending my  money on someone to do what you ordinarily think a campaign manager  does.  That first year in    94, I probably spent in the neighborhood of twenty or  twenty-five thousand dollars, and twelve years later you couldn   t begin  to run a campaign on that. Most of the expense that I had was just  material that I handed out to people and postage for things that I mailed  to them and some advertising, and that was about it.  So your last campaign cost how much? Did you figure out the  difference?  It was not a great deal different, no. I probably spent maybe thirty-five  or forty thousand dollars, because few of those things had gone up. But I  did not spend a lot of money on campaigns   just couldn   t do it.  Your first election you won by like seventy-five percent of the vote or  something like that?  No, it was very close.  It was close?  Yes, because the incumbent, who had said he wasn   t going to run again,  did run. We had to have a run-off after the primary. There was no  general election opponent, no republican ran that year. They ran every  year after that, but they didn   t run that year. I would say that it was more  like I was in the upper fifties and he would have been in the upper  forties.  8  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  How long had he been in office?  Twenty-some years.  And had a woman ever held the office from your district?  No.  No? So it was a major coup for a woman to beat a man that had been in  that spot for quite some time     But he had a reputation for not always being nice to his opponents   to  being kind of tough on them. He was never that way with me. His wife  was one of my best friends during the campaign and we always sat  together. I don   t have any complaints about that first campaign and his  decision. I had a lot of men say to me, older men of course,    Barbara, I  just can   t vote for you. I just don   t think a woman ought to do those  things. You know I like you and I like Ross. I just can   t vote for you.     And he  the incumbent  may have decided to run again because he  didn   t want to see a woman get it. I don   t know. But I know that he was  never ugly to me in any way during the campaign.  I don   t really believe I   ve ever had an opponent who has been. I think  that there   s one thing that, at the local level anyway, has not really  changed much in all of that time. It   s not just me. I think for a male to be  really tacky to a female incites some hostility from other females.  They   re going to respond positively to the female if she   s not being  tacky herself, if she   s just passing it off and going on. This is business  and, you know, I can go out and eat with them later.  How many other women were in the House your first time in?  I can   t tell you that. I can tell you that I looked up where Oklahoma  ranked in all of the states in the country with the number of women  legislators and we were dead last. The other states were not large, but we  were absolutely dead last. I don   t know if that has ever changed for  Oklahoma. It would be like teacher   s pay. If it moves up one, it might be  a little bit higher for a year or two and then it   s back down. I think,  maybe, in the House at one time we had five or six out of a hundred and  one. That   s miniscule. The Senate has had proportionately a few more.  They only have forty-eight people over there.  What do you think we need to do to get those numbers up?  I think we need to do lots of things. First of all, we need to convince  people that women bring to the table an important ingredient in  9  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  legislation. Our presence cuts down on dirty jokes and a few things like  that, that go on when there are no women there. I   ve been on boards and  I   ve been in groups of superintendents and I know when there are  women there, the conversation subject matter is a little different than it is  when we are not there.  In addition to what I would consider the moral area of why we need to  be there, I think we also bring to the table attributes that are not so  common in men. It   s not that men do not like children. I know that they  like children, but there are not very many men who have spent years of  their lives home with their children involved in educating at home before  they get to kindergarten. And there are not very many men who do the  care giving roles that women do, not only with their own parents but  probably with their husband   s parents as well. We just have an interest  in areas that   I don   t want to say the men are not interested in, but I  would say they don   t have the experience in it that we have, and I think  that   s wonderful.  My issues were education, which involves not only teachers and  administrators but it definitely involves kids, and that   s something  women are very interested in. We   re also interested in older people     and sometimes it hits you kind of hard as you start getting there. I did  not like turning sixty-five, but I also don   t like the alternative. I think we  have a sincere, genuine interest and experience in older adults. It   s not  that men are not good listeners. I think men are good listeners, but I  think not only are women good listeners I think we understand some  things to ask older people.  I think that an all-male group is minus a significant factor if they do not  have women on every committee that they have in the House and in the  Senate, or whatever the group may be, even if it   s not legislators. If you  don   t have at least one female on it, there   s something missing. We  bring attributes that are different. It   s not that they   re better. It   s simply  that they   re different. And when females are the majority of the  population, I think it   s a little strange for us not to be present everyplace  there   s a decision-making process.  What do you think is the biggest hurdle from the woman   s point?  I   m not sure I know. I think I understand a little better after having been  there, so I   ll give you two or three instances.  Okay.  If you live in the Oklahoma City area, it   s much easier for you to be in  the Oklahoma legislature because you don   t have to leave your families  10  in order to go stay in a hotel while you   re in Oklahoma City. That   s a  factor if we want women from a lot of different areas. I live in what is  classified as a rural area, because Muskogee is not the size of Oklahoma  City and Tulsa. I would never have considered it a rural area until I got  there  State Capitol  and found out about that.  I knew we had lots of farmers but I didn   t know anything about  agriculture, nothing at all. I had some good friends in my district and  some good constituents who helped educate me in that area. In the  western part of the state we have many more women who are active in  agriculture. I want them to be sent to the legislature. I do not know all of  the brand new ones, but I think they bring, even in the area of  agriculture, some different attributes than the men have. I think that we  need to be present on everything.  One of the funnest bills   and funnest is one of my favorite words   one  of the funnest bills I ever did was a crossbow hunting bill, and everyone  looked at me like I was nuts. I have to admit, I hunted when I was a kid.  I   ve told you I was an only child. I think you   ve probably figured out,     Well she was probably a tomboy,    and I was. I hunted with my father  and was involved with target shooting and things like that. So I had no  objections to hunting or fishing or any of those things.  I had a man in my district with a very serious disability who came to me  and said,    You know, I like to hunt with a bow, but I can   t hunt because  I can   t stand up like you need to stand up to hunt with a regular bow.    It  wasn   t legal to hunt with a crossbow. He said,    I wish you would figure  out a way to help us so that we could do that if we have disabilities that  keep us from being able to hunt with a regular bow.    I thought     that   s  interesting. And of course I   ve always been an educator, not only for  everybody else but for me, too. So I learned a lot about crossbow  hunting and wildlife.  Well, I found out that I had a bunch of good friends in the wildlife  section of Oklahoma. I still enjoy seeing them and finding out about the  things they do like when they put trout in the streams so that we have  better fishing opportunities here in Oklahoma and all kinds of things like  that. They sent me a plaque and it was Legislator of the Year for the  crossbow bill, and I appreciated it. I think that my concern for his  disability and his inability to be able to do something he loved to do with  his son was what got me interested in it. I think women bring those  attributes. We show up on pieces of legislation people wouldn   t think we  would be the least bit interested in as females. We   ve got to bring  females from all across the state, not just those that live in Oklahoma  City and Tulsa. To go over there  Oklahoma City  for four months was  probably one of the most difficult things for me. I think my husband  11  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  loved it. He didn   t have anybody making out any    honey-do    lists for  him while I was away and he had his own business to take care of. I  think he probably came to the legislature   well I know he came the six  times when I was sworn in   but I don   t imagine he came but two or  three times more than that.  Did you rent an apartment or     Yes.     a hotel room or what?  All of those. I lived in a bed and breakfast. Mary Easley moved into that  same bed and breakfast while I was there. Then we moved to a hotel  where Jeri Askins, Mary  Easley  and I lived in different rooms next to  each other. We then rented an apartment and the three of us lived  together. Then Mary went someplace else, I don   t remember where, but  she   s still in the Senate. Then Jeri and I rented an apartment together. So  I   ve lived with Jeri for twelve years and I probably lived with Mary or  right next to Mary for   oh, I don   t know, maybe six or eight years of  that time. We were always very good friends and enjoyed talking about  bills together, too.  There wasn   t a living allowance so that just came out of your regular  salary?  No. No. There was a living allowance.  Oh, okay.  You had a per diem. It took care of meals, where you were staying, and  transportation back and forth from wherever you lived to Oklahoma  City. The people in Oklahoma City, or the surrounding area had a  mileage limit. I   m not sure what it was but it was just easier for them to  go home to their families. My children, for the most part, were both  grown.  Sometimes it   s tougher on a spouse than it is for the person who   s there.  It   s a job. You know, you can   t be mad at somebody for the way they  voted on your bill because next week you may need them to vote on  something else. I was able to do that pretty good. My husband was  always the kind that,    Barbara, don   t worry about it. You   re not gonna  have any competition in this race.    He just kind of kept me built up a lot,  and that was marvelous.  Can you tell me more about the day you were sworn in   feelings and  12  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  emotions and     I can   t remember who the supreme court justice was who swore us in the  first year. I   m going to answer your question, but I   m going all the way  around the bush, as you   ve found I do.  Okay.  The supreme court justices come from all over the state. There was one  there from Muskogee who happened to be a good friend of mine, and if  he didn   t swear us in the first year, he did the second time we were  elected. I have a picture showing him, the back of his head, as he   s  swearing us in. Kids who live in Midwest City, Del City, Oklahoma City  and even Edmond and those places, can come to visit the Capitol so  much more often than our kids. One of the things I always like to tell  kids, especially kids from Muskogee is,    I want you to know how many  people there are who work at the Capitol who are from Muskogee.    I  could point to Drew Edmonson. I could point to Hardy Summers, the  chief justice of the supreme court and I could point to a guy who worked  in the treasurer   s office. I could point to a lot of people who were there  to encourage them and say,    There   s a place for you to work in that area  if you really want to.    And then, of course, there were three of us   Ben  Robinson, Bill Settle and me when I first went up there  Oklahoma  City . They were always very, very good to me. And now I said I   d get  back to your question, and I   ve forgotten what it was.  Maybe I have, too. (Laughter)  That   s all right. (Laughter)  Oh, your first day   what was your first day like?  Oh, the first swearing in? You go into the legislature and you work your  way up on the floor. As you are re-elected, you move up closer to the  front of the chambers. The legislators sit in two groups, republicans on  the right side and democrats on the left side. Jeri  Askins  and I were on  the very back row, and so it was not difficult for us to point ourselves  out in the picture. We were the smallest ones in it, but you could  definitely point us out since we were on the back row. The gallery is just  packed because everybody   s there to see their son, their daughter, their  friend, their spouse sworn in.  I don   t really remember anything special about it, except it was the first  time that I had to sign the pledge that said I   ll do everything I   m  supposed to do.    I will abide by the Constitution of the United States  and the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma. I will not take any money  13  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  for anything other than the salary that I receive for my job.    And I  thought that was a good statement to have on there. That was the first  time I had ever seen that, and they still have exactly the same one.  Do you remember your first day debating a bill, where you were the one  leading the charge?  I can remember several when I was still on the back row, so it would  have been in the first year or two. I   m not a very original person outside  of education. This passed in    96, so it was my first session and I was  bringing a bill to put the Music Hall of Fame in Muskogee. The fellow  who was pushing this idea was in Muskogee, and he asked me if I  thought I could get a bill passed for that, and I thought,    Sure. That  wouldn   t be any problem. We   re just gonna put the Music Hall of Fame  in Muskogee.    Well, the legislator from Shawnee jumped up and he was  very concerned. They had lots of things they thought ought to be in a  music hall of fame and why shouldn   t it be in Shawnee. Tulsa, which  has the Jazz Hall of Fame, thought that we were going to try to take over  everything that they did. So I started out in committee with having to do  some more work explaining to them that this statewide music hall of  fame would be an umbrella hall of fame. It would cover all kinds of  music.  We have an awful lot of people who have been inducted into the Music  Hall of Fame that country and western happens to be their genre, but we  were interested in anybody that had been a long-time resident of  Oklahoma or had been born and lived here for a significant period of  time. I had to do some work to convince the people from Shawnee and I  thought I wasn   t going to be able to, I really did. I had some doubts, and  I don   t usually have too many doubts if I   ve done my homework. I can  get surprised, but I had a pretty tough time on that. We finally got it  passed when I convinced everybody that it was not our intent to close  down any existing hall of fame or inhibit anyone else from starting a hall  of fame that would represent the individual who had been born in that  town because that would also tell us this is someone we need to induct  into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame. Now it   s the Music Hall of  Fame and Museum, and we   re working to improve that.  Are there any other bills that you   re proud of that came through?  Well, I was chair of Education   or one area of education at a time, for  several years. I always considered it my responsibility to encourage and  maybe help improve a good bill whether it belonged to me or someone  else. I felt like it was very important for me not to hear bills that were  not good. You don   t want to take a risk that the bill gets away from you  and someone thinks,    Well that sounds good,    when it is not good. I did  14  Finchum  Staggs  a lot of not-hearing bills. I felt like it was just as important for me to see  that the legislation we sent out was good legislation insofar as we could  improve it to make it that way and also to keep bad legislation from  coming out. Bad legislation sometimes depends on the philosophy of the  party you belong to.  Now that the republicans are in control of the House, we have had  legislation that I really hate to see come through. Republicans have the  opportunity, because of their number in the House, to be able to pass  those, and the Senate has a difficult time because of their number being  able to kill those bills because of the 24-24 split in the Senate. I   m  concerned that we will continue to have good education legislation. I  was vice-chair of some other committees, but I was never a chair of any  committee that was not the education or one segment of education or  another.  How often were you the only woman on the committee?  I don   t believe I was ever the only woman on education, and that   s a  very interesting observation. Many times men thought they should put  women on these committees they called soft committees. It   s interesting  that you have more education legislation than almost any other  legislation. Why do we consider it soft legislation or soft issues? The  very first term I was there, there was a committee called Family Issues  or something like that, and it was a wicked committee. It really got  tough, tough issues. The woman who was in charge of it was a tough,  tough person, and she handled it very, very well, and I was very proud of  her. But they think family issues are going to be things that people will  readily agree on. We   re having lots of controversy in our whole country  over things that most of us would consider family issues, over changing  the way we handle divorces or gay issues, or all of those things. They  are not soft issues. There were always women on education because they  thought that was a soft place to put them.  That was not the only committee I would be on or other women would  be on. I think many women chose education because they liked it. We  got to choose four committees we would like to be on. The leadership  made sure that there weren   t too many people already on that committee.  I think that sometimes it was a choice women made, but I also think  sometimes men thought it was a committee women would know more  about than energy or insurance or things like that. Women are interested  in energy, and we   re also interested in insurance, and there are a lot of  women who are by themselves because they choose to be that way. They  choose not to get married. There are a lot of women who are single  because they   re divorced or they are also single because their spouses  died. They need to know about energy, and they need to know about all  15  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  of these issues. They don   t need to be left out of them because   it   s kind  of like going to buy a car and the salesman never talks to you if you   ve  got your husband with you.  Describe a typical day. How early would you start your day and how  late would you work in the evening, typically?  My philosophy was,    I   m going to try to get all my work done in  Oklahoma City and not have to take it home with me,    because I liked to  do things with my husband and also because I was well-known to show  up at everything. I wanted to know what people in my district were  doing. My husband loved pie auctions so we always went to all the 4-H  and the FFA  Future Farmers of America  and anybody who had a pie  auction   we could probably show up there.  I always went in early. Usually I was at the Capitol by 7:00am or  7:30am and I   ve stayed till 10:00pm or 11:00pm. I did that more when I  was there at the very first because you don   t have a history of the laws,  unless you happen to be an attorney. Since I wasn   t an attorney, I needed  to go back and look at things and maybe even talk to someone else. Bill  Settle, who was there during the first part of my time in the legislature,  was also a late person.  Which floor was your office on? Did you get to move around?  Oh, yes. My office started in what they call the fishbowl, and we shared  secretaries. And it was on the third floor, I think   yes, I   m almost  certain it was. Then we went around on another wing of it. I really liked  the third floor. They decided to move some of the staff out to another  place and expand the area where the legislators were and, when they did,  they didn   t have any marble to replace some of the marble that was in  the hallway, so they did carpet and marble, and carpet and marble.  You can   t imagine how the noise of heels and shoes went down the hall  and we loved it there. Jari, Mary and I were usually pretty close to each  other looking at where our offices were, as well. I was never on the  fourth floor. I was only on the fifth floor after the republicans came to  office, and the fifth floor was where most of the republicans were when  we were in power   when the democrats had the majority in the  legislature. The offices were smaller. You had to climb five flights of  stairs. Of course, for the tomboy that was just good exercise for me and I  didn   t really mind that part. But the offices were pretty small.  Did you have a role model? A mentor?  No. I really didn   t, and I really haven   t. At different times, I have looked  16  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  to people for different things. If there   s something that I consider them  to be pretty good at I try to talk with them and learn what I need to know  about whatever that issue is. I don   t suppose I   ve ever had one person in  my life. The closest that I would come to would be my husband because  he is so extremely laid back. He   s     he   s just, you know, real cool. He  rarely ever gets excited or upset about something, and that   s a good  person to have around. That attribute alone is one that I probably need  more. I need his help, too, when it comes to saying no to things because  I   m not particularly good at saying no. If I can figure out a way to  squeeze it in, and it helps somebody, then I   ll try to do it.  How long have you been married?  I am not good with numbers. I do not even remember our anniversary  date. We will have been married   I can do it like this   in    59 was when  we were married, so in    09 we will have been married fifty years so we  have been married forty-eight years this August.  Do you have a particular political philosophy?  I   m a democrat and I suppose my political philosophy has to do with my  personal philosophy and the things that I   ve always believed in, and my  husband has, too. He never came to an event to hear me speak. He said,     I can hear you at home.    But if they had kids doing something, he  always went with me and we   re both like that. We like to do things with  kids. He is very good about helping people. Now, he   s not so good about  helping me with the yard work, although he has been pretty good this  year because of the ice storm and we   ve had such an unusual amount of  it. But I happen to like doing it anyway and he doesn   t happen to like  doing it, so that   s part of the difference. But we like to help people. If we  see people that have difficulties or they ask us to help them with  something, we try to.  That   s probably been one of my worst situations since I left office. I  have always tried to help people. I   ll always call you back. There are  only a couple of people in my district who can say that I didn   t return a  telephone call, and it   s because I punched the erase button instead of the  forward button to the next message. I always return telephone calls. I  have a lot of people now who call me and still ask me questions. I   ve got  to do some research today on a bill that   s in the legislature and get a  message to a guy who wants me to let him know how it   s going, and I  will. I still have friends who work at the legislature. Staff people have  always been gracious to me whether it   s when I was there or now. I  appreciate that because they know they   re really answering this for a  citizen in the state, and that   s good.  17  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  The only thing is I need to learn to say,    You have a new legislator, and  you really need         I know what I should say.    You really need to call  them. They would want to do this for you   I certainly would hope so     because they want you to vote for them the next time.    But they end up  being people that I know.  I will tell you another philosophy though that I   m glad you let me talk  long enough to remember this. I think that many, many women who are  my age have this same philosophy although they may not verbalize it     and maybe they don   t even realize it, but many of us have been the first  ones to do things in different areas. I was the first female superintendent  in Tahlequah and although interim, the first interim female  superintendent in Muskogee, and the first one to do several things. As an  administrator, I was the first secondary female principal. And my  philosophy has always been that I want to do a good enough job so  people will not say,    Well, I   ll tell you what, I   ll never vote for another  woman again because of the way she  Barbara  was.    People never say,     I   m not gonna vote for another man.     That   s true.  But they would say,    I   m not gonna vote for another woman,    if I had  done a lousy job in some of those places   or,    I   m not ever gonna put a  woman in that position.    It   s going to take quite a while for women to be  treated that equally. I see women who climb poles to do outside work for  the telephone company. I don   t remember seeing them until maybe just  the last few years.  That   s true.  I want women to be able to do whatever it is they want to do and not  have someone say,    We had a woman do that once before and we won   t  ever make that mistake again.     Is there anything you wish you had accomplished while you were in  those twelve years that you just couldn   t get done?  There were lots of things, yes. I wanted to get money into the teacher  retirement, and it didn   t make any difference if it was democrats or  republicans. We made only one change that was a significant change,  and it was moving the fund from which teacher retirement got its  revenue over to sales and personal income taxes. With the republicans in  there now and their desire to always reduce taxes that amount of money  has gone down. So that   s the one thing I regret the very, very most. I   m  pleased with some things that I was able to do in education.  18  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  Staggs  Is there anything I need to ask that I haven   t thought of?  I don   t know. I   m going to look down this first list you gave me.  Okay.  It doesn   t do any good to ask me these things about my prior experience  in political things because I didn   t have any. With an incumbent staying  in, usually endorsements don   t leave the incumbent. That   s the reason  they always say it   s easier to win as an incumbent. I didn   t have a lot of  groups that endorsed me initially and I understood that.  Did I have any people support me? Well, yeah, I had a lot of people  support me but as far as groups collectively, even OEA   now the  teachers in my town did support me, but OEA didn   t because they went  with the incumbent. The Speaker of the House came over and had his  picture taken with the incumbent and it infuriated me, and I thought he  ought to just be quiet. And I said something to Bill  Settle , and he said,     Oh, the Speaker will always support the incumbent. That   s just one of  those political policies that they do.    And I said,    I   ll just remember  that.    And after the election was over and I had won and the Speaker  called me, he said,    I wanted you to know that I   m happy for you and  we   re going to be able to work together.    And I said,    Yes, I   ll give you  an opportunity to apologize in some way.    (Laughter) Anyway, he   s a  good friend of mine and he   s somebody that everyone would recognize,  but it was fun.  There were so many things that I didn   t know, that I had to learn. And  they weren   t things that bothered me. I didn   t know that was the way it  was done. I taught parliamentary procedure in school. I knew I was  going to be able to teach everybody over there how to do parliamentary  procedure, and turned out they don   t use the same form. It was just  hilarious. There were so many things that were different from what I  anticipated. I thought the legislators were all going to be so glad to have  me because I came with all of this information that they needed to have.  A lot of people say that teachers are not good at working in campaigns.  I   d never heard anybody say it until after I got in office, and I can   t say  that that   s true because they were the people who did a million things for  me. When I had telephone numbers that needed to be looked up or when  I needed someone to do a poll for me, I got some teachers to do it and  told them how to do it. I know they did a good job because it was pretty  on when I looked at what the results were. I think that education, and my  experience in education, were significant factors.  Not only did I say I was concerned about and interested in education, I  19  had a background of having been there. When I say I was never in any  political thing before   education can be pretty political, too, especially  when you   re a superintendent or a principal. I did have that little  experience, but basically I just had some wonderful teachers who came  to help me. I think people just need to ask them more, and maybe that   s  what we need to do with a lot of people is ask them to do things for us.  I   m impressed with the young people who are getting interested in  politics. It isn   t a large group, and I   m concerned that the future may  have fewer people who go to vote than what we even have now. And I  really believe we need to work at keeping people focused on   if you  don   t go vote   that   s the minimum thing that you should do   then you  should be ashamed of yourself.  The next thing is you ought to be active. I was just recently elected the  county democrat chair in Muskogee County. I really wasn   t ready to do  it but I thought maybe I can get some more people involved and we can  work to change some things. We have two young people in this group,  and we had about eighty that day   only two young people, and I   m  really concerned about that. The young people who are interested seem  to be vibrantly interested, but I   m not sure the democrats are working as  hard as we ought to work to get young people moved back in. I was at  the high school the other day and a young man came up to me and said,     I want to come do some things for you. I see that you   re going to be  working with the democrat party in Muskogee.    So, you know, little by  little I think we can get them in but I am concerned about that.  You had a question about tough choices. That   s a pretty funny one.  Because I had spent so much time in school, when we had the concealed  weapons bill, I had a pretty difficult time with it. We kept guns locked  up. I wasn   t that concerned about them, and my Dad had taught me how  to take care of them. Ross  husband  had taught our sons how to take  care of them, but the notion of concealed weapons really kind of  bothered me because I thought we   re going to have kids bringing these  things to school. Well, it   s true. We do. But I had one call from my  husband in twelve years, and he called and said,    I am one of your  constituents. I want to tell you that I would appreciate it very much if  you would vote for the concealed weapons bill.    And I said,    Well, I   ll  be sure to write this down that you have called, and we   ll remember that,  and I appreciate it.     Then I had a jillion women   and I don   t know how big a jillion is, but  it   s a whole bunch   and they were women who worked in the evening,  worked at night   went out to their cars after it was dark. They worked  in the hospital or they worked different places doing late jobs and said,     Make an honest woman out of me. I carry a gun, and I will make it a  concealed weapon, and I   ll take all the training I   m supposed to have.     20  Finchum  Staggs  And it was the women who made the difference for me. I still have those  reservations because of the school, but women were saying that they  were in places after dark where they did not feel safe. They obviously  had spent a little time learning to use a gun because I had some who told  me that either they had spouses who had helped them or they had  children   in some cases, grown children who had helped them   and  that bill bothered me. I did vote for the bill.  I had some others that I disagree with my constituents on and I will vote  the way the constituents want me to vote, unless I can really see that  they don   t understand an issue. Then I   ve always told my constituents,     If you and I disagree, it   s your responsibility to educate me or it   s my  responsibility to educate you.    One thing I always did was a survey. I  did a survey every year, not just election years, because I would tell  them what I anticipated seeing in legislature the next year and ask them  how they felt about it. I had pretty good response to that. And not only  does it give you an excuse   like on the concealed weapons bill when all  of them called me and I went over to that side   it also reinforces you  when all of you seem to agree. And one of the things that really pleased  me in the twelve years I was in the legislature was my constituents and I  agreed the majority of the time on most of the things that I asked them  about.  I was very surprised on Right to Work. When I first started asking my  constituents about Right to Work, it was, oh, a very miniscule number of  people who were in favor it. And I must have asked that then for four or  five years, and those in favor of it increased in number over the years. It  never got significantly above fifty percent, but I would say initially it  was down in the twenties and it was an interesting observation because it  means that those folks in favor of Right to Work were doing some kind  of a good campaign that was convincing people that that needed to be  here. I   ve never been a person in favor of Right to Work. So that was a  real surprise to me, and I   m sure that we have passed lots of things that  have had really good campaigns with the public as well as with the  legislators to get them passed. I may have been guilty of falling prey to  some of those campaigns, too.  But over the course of the year, you have to go through an awful lot of  bills, too, don   t you?  Yes, and that was a surprise to me. I was sure that nobody up there was  reading those bills, and I was going to be the only one reading them.  You know, I just had all kinds of grandiose ideas about (Laughter) what  it was going to be like when I arrived. I discovered that, by far, the  majority of the legislators read the bills when I went to committee, if the  bill was in that committee, it was rare indeed for a person sitting there  21  Finchum  Staggs  Finchum  not to have read the legislation. We didn   t always agree on the bill, of  course, but I knew that they had studied it and I was interested in their  opinion on that.  Another thing that surprised me about the legislature is that all of us  have a background, and the experiences that we   ve had are the things  that help us do a good job. And I would say that almost everybody in the  House and Senate has a friend in that body who is good at something.  They may be insurance people. They either own an insurance office or  they   ve been in insurance sales for years, and when we have insurance  bills, then we go visit with that person and it doesn   t make any  difference what party they   re in. When it comes to that, you want the  best information you can get. I   m not going to ask the author of the bill  so often as I   m going to ask a person who   s had experience in that area  because they will generally tell you both sides of it.  And I also have a reputation   when a lobbyist would visit me      I   ll be  happy to hear your side of it, but I also want you to tell me what the  other side is as well.    And the lobbyists that we had in Oklahoma City,  with the exception of maybe a couple of them, didn   t lie to you. They  would tell you the good and the bad, and they   re going to embellish the  good as much as they possibly can, but they would tell you both sides of  it. And they   d say,    This is what the other side is saying and wanting.     Those things are important to you, and I think you decide you   re going  to not deal with somebody who doesn   t tell you the truth.  My last question is when history is written about you, what would you  like for it to say?  I would like them to say that I listened to my constituents and I tried as  often as I could to support those things that they wanted me to support  and to not support those things that they wanted me to vote against, and I  hope that I was always truthful with them.  I   d say you were. Well, that   s all my questions. Thank you very much for  visiting with us today. This was great.  ------- -------
