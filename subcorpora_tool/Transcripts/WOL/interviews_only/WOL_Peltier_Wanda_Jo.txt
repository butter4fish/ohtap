Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m here today with Wanda Jo Peltier, and  we   re in the Southern Oaks Public Library in Oklahoma City, and today  is May 16, 2007. This is part of the Oklahoma State Library   s project  called Women of the Oklahoma Legislature Past and Present. So  welcome today, and thank you for talking with us.  My pleasure.  Okay, tell me where you were born and just a little bit about your  childhood and then we   ll move forward.  Well, I was born in Checotah, Oklahoma. I   m a lifelong Oklahoman  born in 1933 during the Depression. I   ve heard all about the hard times,  and the resulting attitudes affect my life until this day.  How early did you get interested in politics?  Well, it was in the 1970   s when my husband and I lived on a farm near  Macomb, Oklahoma. That   s when I learned from the League of Women  Voters that there were some laws on the books that seriously affected  women in my situation   that is, women working with their husbands in  small businesses or in farming operations. They told me that one of the  laws said the husband is the head of the family. He can choose the place  and the mode of residence and the wife will conform. A second one was  that Oklahoma is a separate property state as opposed to a community  property state. In a community property state, the wife has the legal right  to half of the property acquired during the marriage. But in a separate  property state, the property belongs to the person who earned the money  to buy it, and since the husband was the head of the household, that   s the  automatic assumption that the husband owns the property. So I got to  5  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  thinking,    Well, if I died first, this property would belong to my husband  free and clear with no questions asked, and if he died first, I would have  to prove money or money   s worth to own my very own property.    So  that   s when we got a will, and it   s a good thing we did because a few  years later, he died of cancer and I would have been in a real mess  without that will because of the laws on the Oklahoma books.  About that time, the Equal Rights Amendment was beginning to come  up before the Oklahoma Legislature, and I thought    Now that   s what we  need.    So I went with a group of women over to the Capitol to speak and  to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment, and we were so na  ve. We  thought if we looked good, if we smelled good, if we made sense, it was  a done deal. Well, about all we got at first were pats on the head that is,  until we organized   but that   s another story.  Well, go ahead and delve into that, if you want to, while we   re on it   or  do you want to wait till later?  Well, no, that   s fine.  Okay.  We built the Oklahoma Women   s Political Caucus, which is a branch of  the National Women   s Political Caucus, which is bipartisan by the way,  and mostly made up of women but men were most welcome. During the  struggle for the Equal Rights Amendment, we built the Oklahoma  Women   s Political Caucus to be the third largest in the nation, based on  population. We had more than 800 members statewide and I was the  chair from 1980 to 1984.  Our goals, of course, were ratification of Equal Rights Amendment first  and foremost, and also to elect women and men to office who supported  the Equal Rights Amendment and who were pro-choice as well. And we  did a pretty good job. In 1982, we raised  16,000 and we invested 5,000  hours in campaigns. In 1984, we raised  23,000, spent 10,000 hours  campaigning. We ended up with 13 women in the legislature in  1985.That   s up from six women ten years earlier in 1975 and, of course,  we helped men along the way, too but the best part was we got first-rate  training and know-how from the National Women   s Political Caucus. I  remember one year I got to go a day early to a national conference for a  workshop, a political workshop, and it featured the foremost political  consultants of the day, Bob Shrum, the democrat, and John Deardorf, the  republican. The workshop was fabulous.  Great background to run your own campaign later, I suppose.  6  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Yes.  When you got back, did you initiate anything that you had learned  there?  Oh, yes   absolutely. In campaigns, in individual campaigns, we worked  in lots of campaigns, and I   ve worked in campaigns for twenty years     more than twenty years actually.  Tell me about your first one.  Well, it started at the breakfast table. After I had spent the entire night  getting a campaign mailing ready for a candidate, we didn   t have all the  automation back then, and my dear sweet husband of two years said,     Sweet baby, if you   re gonna spend your life in everybody else   s  campaign, you might as well run yourself.    What he said was scary, but  interesting.  I   m a researcher by profession, among other things, and so I did the  research. I found a district where I thought I could win and took my  portable computer down to the Oklahoma County Election Board. I  typed in everything I could find about the voters. Then I printed out  some 4 X 6 cards and started knocking on doors. That was way back  when you had to register to vote through a voter   s registrar. I would  knock and I   d say,    Hello, I know that John and Mary are registered to  vote here, but does anybody else in your family need to register to  vote?    And along the way, I registered about 500 people, but I cleaned  up my mailing list, too. When I finished at each house, I would say,     Thank you for your time. I would love for you to have a copy of my  favorite recipe.    The recipe was on a yellow 4 X 6 card with the heading  at the top,    Wanda Jo   s Hot Hominy.    So I was getting name  identification along the way, but it was a splendid recipe and I got  requests for it for years to come.  I decided after walking and talking it over with my husband, that there  was compatibility there. The district was made up of older people  primarily, and many of them were older ladies who were living alone  and they just reminded me of my dear sweet Aunt Myrtle, you know     so it was almost like family, and that   s when we moved. My husband  owned his house when we got married two years prior. He sold his  house in northwest Oklahoma City. We moved to southwest Oklahoma  City, and that   s when the campaign became public. The next thing I did  was to walk the district, this time with a petition. Up at the top it said,    If  you will sign, Wanda Jo can save the  200 filing fee      some more of  that Depression-type frugality, I guess. I went to each door this time and  I said,    Now this doesn   t mean that you   ll vote for me at all. It just  7  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  means that you   re helping me save that  200.    But that time along the  way, I noticed something unique about each house   the purple petunias  in the flower beds, the dog   s name, the wind chimes   colorful. I loved  colorful wind chimes, the elephant ears, anything that was different, and  I jotted the information down on the card. My goal was 5,000 signatures  and I got them.  Then it was time for me to file for office, so I sent out a little yellow post  card telling the people    up at the top, there I sat. The drawing looked  like me. I was sitting in a basket in a hot air balloon and I was holding a  banner and on that banner at the top it said,    Lift up District 93. Vote  Wanda Jo Peltier.    A printed note said I had filed for office, and at the  bottom I wrote a handwritten note      loved your purple petunias           hello to Fido      or whatever was unique there. You know a year after  that, a woman called me and she said,    Honey, I got you some of those  purple petunias.    Those were my favorites though really   purple  petunias mixed with pink, and I became quite an authority on flowers  going door to door, by the way. And so the third time I walked, I shook  their hands, looked them straight in the eye and asked them for their vote  and a yard sign, and I got them quite successfully   and that was my first  campaign.  I read a story about a wheelbarrow full of apricots     Oh, well, yes   our   (Laughs) there   s some more of the Depression  stuff, isn   t it? Well, yes, I was campaigning. This man had a  wheelbarrow full of apricots and the flies were just swarming, you  know, and he was gonna bury them to get rid of the flies. So I rescued  those apricots and took them home. My husband and I cleaned them  really well, put them in the freezer and made fried pies for the campaign  workers.  That   s a good story that needs to be down, I think.  And one time, a man took me in his back yard to show me something in  a pick-up, some literature or something. He had a pick-up out there, and  his dalmatian, a huge dog, bit me on the leg. Oh my, it was a bad,  vicious bite. So the man took me to the emergency room for a tetanus  shot, and I was out hobbling around the next morning. That was when I  was getting my 5,000 signatures, so I had adventures along the way.  And did you have a campaign manager or were you it?  No, I didn   t have a campaign manager.  And how about your budget, for your first campaign?  8  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Well, you mean where did the money come from?  Or how much you had even.  Well, not very much. As you can see, I didn   t need very much. I got the  most support from individual members of the Oklahoma Women   s  Political Caucus. They sent me checks, and I didn   t take any PAC   Political Action Committee  money at all during my ten years in office.  I didn   t ask the democratic party for any support.  For any of the campaigns?  No, for any of the campaigns. But I had a carnival after I was elected. I  started having a carnival every year. We have a huge back yard and my  constituents come and friends and caucus members   everybody came,  and we ate barbeque, drank lemonade, and played games that had  political names   fun games really. For example,    Play veto. You too  have power.       Play Porko. Bring home the bacon.    And one was     whatever was current at the time, whatever issue   and one game I  remember one year was    Tin cups. Tin cups for lame ducks. Help them  fly high at taxpayer expense.     That game was about last minute trips  made by those going out of office.   About how many people would be in your back yard at one time?  Oh, a lot   fifty to a hundred. They   d come and go and I raised about   2,500 each year. That was ample. Postcards didn   t cost much, and I  really communicated mostly on postcards. You can   t get people to read  big long things. What they can read between the front door and the trash  is about all that works.  That   s true.  And there was not a lot of trouble with the post office then. We didn   t  have to have bar codes and all that automated stuff, so it was quite easy  to do a mailer. I never lacked for constituents after that first election to  help stuff envelopes or do whatever needed to be done. I walked that  district every single year, and knocked on the door and said,    Because I  work for you, I   m reporting to you   and my home phone number is  right there, so please call me anytime.    They did, and I answered my  phone at home. One morning at 5:30, a woman called me and she said,     Honey, I   m going to the hospital now,     and at the very beginning when  I was first elected, one older man called me every night to pray. So I  listened to him pray every night. I thought that was a bit much, but  anyway.  9  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  You were a comfort to him.  That   s what you get when you answer your phone at home, too, I guess.  Tell me about your first opponent. Who did you run against?  Oh, well, I   m not gonna tell you because he   s high up in democrat  politics, and I don   t want to embarrass him.  It was a man?  Yes, a man was my first primary opponent.  Okay, primary.  And I had a general opponent, an incumbent   a Republican incumbent  for the general election.  Male or female?  Female.  So a female had held the position before you did?  Yes.  And has there been a female after you?  No. My successor was Al Lindley, and he   s term-limited. He   s in his last  term. He   s a fun legislator. I like him a lot.  Do you remember your first day you were sworn in   the very first one?  (Laughs) Yes, yes, I do. John Monks was in the chamber and he looked  around, and I thought he would faint and fall out of his seat. He is  deceased now, but he was a legislator from Muskogee and during our  work for the Equal Rights Amendment and the days of the Women   s  Political Caucus, we leafleted his district one time. Thirteen members of  our SWAT team from the Oklahoma Women   s Political Caucus, went to  leaflet the grocery stores in his district because he was very opposed to  the Equal Rights Amendment. Our flyers said,    Did your 59 cents buy a  dollar   s worth of groceries today?    We were, of course, pointing up the  inequity of pay between men and women. We went on to say,    If not,  call Representative John Monks,    and we gave his home phone number.     He   s the one who voted against cervical cancer screening, against  displaced homemakers, against victims of domestic violence,    and the  10  Finchum  Peltier  list went on. He was not too happy with us, but then I tried to make up  with him when I was elected.  In my very first session, I was getting ready to go to work, and I heard  on the television that,    This is the 75th anniversary of the Girl Scouts.     So I thought,    Well       I remembered from the struggle for the Equal  Rights Amendment that the Boy Scout flag could fly over the Capitol  but not the Girl Scout flag, and so I thought,    Well, wouldn   t it be nice if  I filed a bill to allow the Girl Scout flag to fly over the Capitol?    just as  a little nicety, not significant legislation or anything. I thought,    I   ll stop  by Representative Monks    office and see if he   ll co-author this bill with  me.    I just thought that was a really good political move after the past  and he was delighted. He told me that he had filed the Boy Scout flag  bill, and he was just so happy to do that. I knew that it was far enough  along in the session that we couldn   t get bills out of committee because  the deadline had passed, so I thought,    Well, we   ll just do it next year.  We   ll announce this and tell the Girl Scouts    happy birthday    and finish  the bill next year.    First thing I knew, Representative Monks was  standing up on the House floor and he said,    I ask unanimous consent to  pass this Girl Scout bill and send it on to the Senate,    and so it  happened, just like that, within seconds.  A couple of weeks later, I was driving home from the Capitol and I  heard on the radio that the Make My Day amendment had been attached  to the Girl Scout bill, and I thought,    Well      I didn   t think too much  about it. I thought,    Well, the media   s made a mistake. Something   s  wrong here.    Sure enough, what had happened in the Senate, Senator  Ford from Tulsa had filed a Make My Day bill and Governor Bellmon  had vetoed it. They got together and compromised and they came up  with language suitable to both of them, and they couldn   t find a place to  put it. Well, the Girl Scout bill was the only bill alive in the Senate that  was in the criminal section of the law. It said,    It is against the law for  any flag to fly over governmental buildings, except the American flag,  Oklahoma flag, Red Cross, Boy Scout, Girl Scout,    and so they put the  Make My Day amendment in the Girl Scout bill. It came back to the  House from the Senate and Representative Jeff Hamilton got up and  asked,    Is this germane to the intent of this bill?    Lonnie Abbot from  Ada was sitting in the Speaker   s chair and he slammed down the gavel  and he said,    It   s germane.    Representative Monks, of course, was  handling the bill, and that   s how I became the principle author of the  Make My Day law in Oklahoma.  I guess it made your day then, didn   t it?  (Laughs) No, I   m not too sure about that. (Laughter)  11  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Tell me about a typical day. How early would you get started and how  late would you stay up?  Well, I was so proud of that job and I was just so grateful to my  constituents for electing me that I just wanted to do the best job I  possibly could. I got up at 3:00 every morning to read the bills. There  were stacks. They were just massive sometimes, but I did. I would get  out to the Capitol, follow through, and I was known for catching the,     wooly boogers,    in the bills. You know, things slipped in for special  interests that were harmful to my constituents and, of course, I   d point  that out. I couldn   t always take them out   couldn   t always get the vote  to take them out, but I certainly exposed them.  If you got up at 3:00, how early would you get to the Capitol? It  wouldn   t open till 8:00, would it?  Oh, it took a long time to read the bills   hours and hours.  But you did that at home, not in your office?  At home   oh, yes   no, I didn   t go to the Capitol until eight     And you lived close enough where you didn   t have to rent an apartment  or     Oh, I lived close, yes   five miles probably from the Capitol.  So if you got up that early, how late did you stay up? Were you up till  midnight? You had to sleep sometime.  Well, no. My body clock is strange, different, I suppose. I got up at 3:00  this morning. So it   s not an ordeal for me. But, I go to bed about 8:00, so  I get plenty of sleep.  And you had to attend functions and     Well, no, I didn   t. I didn   t participate in a lot of them   the evening  functions.  How many other women were in office when you were there   in the  House?  Well     Counting yourself.  12  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  There were thirteen women in all.  Okay.  I think there were seven in the House.  Did you have to share an office?  No. I had a little cubbyhole on the third floor. It was not very big, but I  filled it with plants and it was very comfortable.  Did you do lunch out or lunch in?  I lunched in. I don   t ever remember doing lunch out to tell you the truth.  There wasn   t time.  I   m very practical. (Laughs) That   s right.  What was your biggest challenge as far as a bill goes? Does any bill  come to mind?  Well   oh, yes, I had a lot of challenges. (Laughs) I didn   t go out there  with a preconceived notion about what I was going to do, what bills to  file, issues I would pursue, or anything. But the issues were thrust upon  me almost immediately after I was elected to office in November   when  everybody was busy with holidays, you know.  My constituents started getting these attractive pink and blue brochures  from Southwestern Bell describing a personalized calling plan, and it  sounded so good. They could save money on their phone bills by paying  only for the calls they actually made. They were special because only  five areas in the State of Oklahoma were being chosen to field test this  personalized calling plan. Well, as a researcher, I started digging in and I  found out that this personalized calling plan was a form of local  measured service, LMS, we called it. It was a per-call charge for each  local call as if it were long distance by the time placed, the distance  called, and the amount of time on the phone. So I held a press  conference. I filed a bill that delayed the implementation of local  measured service in Oklahoma for three years, and we had a full-blown  campaign going. We even had our visuals, and we had a slogan. The  visual was of a little lady in a rocking chair in her modest little living  room. There was a pay phone on the wall that said,    Pay before dialing,     and she was sitting there thinking,    LMS means    leaves me silent.       We  won the first round and that was at the beginning of 1997.  13  Finchum  Peltier  I learned that President Reagan and the U.S. Congress had reduced  corporate income tax by 12 percent, from 46 percent to 34 percent, and  that the utilities were holding  19 billion in taxes they had collected  through our utility bills. They would never owe it to the Internal  Revenue Service because the taxes had dropped. They just wouldn   t owe  it, and I thought,    Well, that money belongs to my constituents.    So I  went to the Corporation Commission to see where it was and to get it  back to them. I found that the Corporation Commission had already  given OG E  60 million. So here I go to Attorney General Robert  Henry, and I remember just shaking with anger, and he was very nice.  He told me he would intervene in the very next case, and he did. The  next case was the Southwestern Bell case, as fate would have it. The  Attorney General sent Robert Butkin over there to represent the rate-payers,  and he couldn   t have chosen a finer person. Robert was our state  treasurer after that time, and the case dragged on for almost ten years.  Along the way, we enlisted the help of AARP   and I got documents.  When you   ll stand up and speak out, people will slip things to you, so I  got these private documents that showed that two of the Corporation  Commissioners had signed a private deal   you know, in the back  room   to settle that rate case for hundreds of thousands of dollars less  than what was actually owed. But our dear Attorney General Drew  Edmondson finally settled that case, I believe, in 1995 for  640 million.  And each of us, each of the rate-payers in Oklahoma got, at the time of  the settlement, a check for  125 plus a calling card worth about  40, I  think, along with other benefits through using certain services.  I   ve described the settlement of that case and those additional benefits in  this booklet that I published near the end of my term. It   s called,    How  many politicians does it take to       and the end of the question is on each  chapter in the book. And this booklet contains my weekly columns that I  wrote when I was in the legislature, and the Oklahoma Press Association  posted my columns on its bulletin board. They were published in  newspapers around the state. This booklet is full of information about  utility issues     We   ll have to go look.  I just fell into that issue by accident really, but I   m leaving this with you.  You can have this booklet.  The other significant issue with lasting impact   I learned that the state   s  cost for in-patient psychiatric care of children in private hospitals had  exploded. It had gone from  7 million in 1983 to a projected  98 million  ten years later in 1993. So I did a lot of research on this, and I found that  over 500 of those children were age four and under. I found that many of  the children were being locked up for acting out, you know, typical  14  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  adolescent behavior   failing to obey rules, talking back, using four-letter  words. I thought the situation was so serious that I did pass a law  which strengthened out-patient mental health service and said that in-patient  psychiatric care for children would become a last resort instead  of a first response. Helen Cole carried that bill in the Senate, a  Republican. It was a true bipartisan effort and it passed overwhelmingly.  I kept up with cost savings for the first three years, and we saved the  taxpayers  40 million a year plus a lot of kids didn   t get stigmatized  along the way.  That   s good to hear.  And the fourth   Freddye Williams, dear Freddye Williams, had filed a  bill the year before. This was the second year around for her to try to  pass that bill, and it took that Head of the Household law off of the  books. You remember,    The husband is the head of the household and  he will choose the place and mode of living and the wife will sit there  and conform.    That bill affected young women in Oklahoma in college  who married out-of-state men   they automatically were eligible for out-of-  state tuition then, and      Interesting.     we had a legislator in Oklahoma City who married a legislator in  Tulsa and, under that law, the woman in Tulsa would have been  ineligible to represent her constituents because her legal residence would  be in Oklahoma City. But Freddye filed the bill, I gathered up the votes,  and we got that sucker off the books.  Full circle.  Yes. (Laughter)  What went into your decision making to not run for twelve years? You  served ten years, right?  Well, yes, but the way I did it, so independently   can   t go on forever. I  just burned out. I just couldn   t bear the thought of knocking on 5,000  doors that eleventh year, I guess, because I was exhausted. I gave  everything I had to that job   just everything   and I have the dearest,  sweetest husband in the whole world. He supported me 110 percent, and  he took as much pride in my accomplishments as I did. But I decided  then, after I knew so much about utility issues, that I would run for the  Corporation Commission, and I did. I ran a very effective statewide race,  and I was runner-up (Laughs) with 48 percent of the vote statewide. It  was a big disappointment to me that I hadn   t won, but I gave that  15  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  everything I had, too.  Then after that, what?  Well, I have had a busy, busy life outside the legislature. I spent two  years with a private tutor learning Spanish. I   ve worked in numerous  campaigns since I have retired from the legislature. I spent five years  tutoring adults to read at a community literacy center, and spent six  months in a local school in the reading lab with small children. And I  discovered those for whom English is a second language primarily had  such difficulty with our vowel sounds. We have nineteen vowel sounds  in English, which don   t seem so difficult for those of us who   ve grown  up hearing them. But they   re such a challenge, and I couldn   t find the  material that I needed to be an effective volunteer tutor and so I created  it. I wrote a book and published it. It   s called,    Vowels, Patterns and  Sounds,    and it   s very clear, simple and understandable. It doesn   t have  all those difficult words in it that you have to learn. It   s just plain  English, and I have a web site on the Internet for that book now. I   m so  proud of it.  We   ll take a look at that, too. Have you considered running again?  No. My district is open, the seat is open after Al Lindley retires. I  believe I could win, but after I won   oh my, I don   t know if I could do  it   if I have enough energy to give what it would take. My husband is  84 years old now and he   s just been such a wonderful man. I just  couldn   t be all-consumed with being in the legislature at this point in his  life and at this point in my life really.  Well, you have done well for the state, having done ten years. We   re  lucky to have had you there.  Thank you. Thank you very much. The part I enjoyed the most was  helping constituents deal with bureaucrats and red tape. When they  couldn   t get through to the right people, and just got so frustrated. As I  said, I answered my phone at home and 30,000 people have a lot of  problems. So it was just such a pleasure, such a satisfaction for me to be  able to call an agency and get straight through to the head of that agency.  But, I spent my time solving legitimate problems and not making deals  or anything like that, and that was very satisfying. That   s a powerful  position, and it   s rewarding to use your power to help people with their  everyday problems   but I tell you one problem I created myself that I  never will forget     Okay.  16  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  A person called me and said,    Our neighbor   s septic tank is running over  and it   s stinking, and it   s fouling the whole neighborhood.    So I called  the county health department and reported it. They said they   d take care  of it and I didn   t think much more about it. But a couple of days later,  this older man late, late in the afternoon came banging on the door, and I  thought he was gonna have a heart attack. He said,    County health  department   s gonna turn the water off on our block tomorrow.    I didn   t  connect the two at all, so I told him I   d try to help. I called the county  health department and they said,    Well, my goodness we   re trying to  help you    (Laughs) and so I asked them,    Please don   t turn the water  off. I   ll see what we can do,    and so I went to the city. I couldn   t  imagine there was a block without a sewer line on it, but there was, so I  negotiated with the city and with the homeowners there. The city would  build the sewer line if the homeowners would pay  30 a month through  their water bills until their part was paid, and everybody was happy to do  that, so I solved the problem. I don   t think anybody ever found out who  created it in the first place. (Laughs)  Any other favorite stories?  Well, not that I can think of at the moment.  No more recipes to share?  No. (Laughs) I don   t even have a copy of the original   well, not in its  form, you know   not on the little yellow card. I gave them all away.  What advice would you give a young woman today thinking about going  into politics?  Well, I would say,    Life is short, and we just go around once      and you  know our first grade reader said,    Run Dick Run.    I   d say,    Run Jane  Run. You   ll always regret it if you don   t.     How did pay differ between men and women? You had commented  earlier that it was the first job that you had had equal pay for.  Well, yes. I was so grateful for that job because it   s the first one I ever  had with equal pay for equal work. Well, equal pay anyway.  I thought that was interesting. Did you have a mentor, role model?  No. I really didn   t have a role model or a mentor. Well, my dear Aunt  Myrtle. I loved my dear Aunt Myrtle. She wore an apron, worked in the  garden, cooked and all of that. She   s my role model for being   oh, kind  and generous and helpful to people. My political role model was, I  17  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  suppose, Betty Friedan. She wrote,    The Feminist Mystique,    in 1963,  and she was one of the founding members of the National Women   s  Political Caucus. I didn   t read her book until 1969. Have you read it?  No, but I think I should now.  Well, it   s mesmerizing. It was about the problem that has no name, and  the problem that has no name was this social expectation that women  would be quiet and passive and submissive and live their lives through  their husbands and their children. That book had a profound effect on me  and my thinking.  As did the women in the caucus   the National Women   s Political  Caucus? Did they have an effect?  Well, yes   the women and the men, those two male political consultants  who were prominent in the day gave me the best advice I ever had on  how to run for office. I don   t remember exactly what it was, but I put it  into effect.  Well, knocking on doors, did your hand get tired of being shook?  You know it was the most interesting thing. It was so difficult for me to  shake hands   to learn to shake hands. Finally, it just got automatic. I  enjoyed it. We just became family in that district almost. As I recall, I  got about two thirds of the vote in that first campaign in both the  democratic primary and in the general election. After that I got in the  70th percentile   somewhere in the 70th percentile   and one time I even  got 90 percent of the vote. That was a strange campaign. My opponent   s  name was Joy Weed.  A woman?  A woman   and she filed. I didn   t notice it before the Friday that I could  have said something and challenged it. I knew the address was right in  the middle of the district, and so when I was knocking on doors I came  to that house and it was empty. I knew it had been empty for several  years since. I knocked every year and so I put out a post card   a little  yellow post card, and there was Sherlock Holmes with his magnifying  glass and Dr. Watson, and it asked,    Has anybody seen Wanda Jo   s  opponent living inside District 93?      but I didn   t tell them to call me  about that. (Laughs) But anyway, I put out the postcard. Well, I had  taken a picture of the empty rooms in the house. I put a camera up to the  window. My husband was there and the neighbor across the street came  to watch me, and I ran the picture of the inside of the empty house. My  opponent went to the police and reported me for breaking her door  18  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  down, and she even took her receipt where she had had to have the door  fixed. So I ended up at the police station, and they gave a copy of the  photo to an expert, photo expert, and he said,    It has been taken through  glass.    So that was the end of that, but I got 90 percent of the vote that  time around.  Your little yellow post cards worked well, didn   t they?  Yes, they did.  Let me check my questions, Wanda. I think we   ve gone through most of  this.  Oh, you asked about local constituent issues? What was the most  important to my constituents? Could I tell you about that?  Sure.  I soon learned that they were very vocal about their property tax because  it kept going up. It   s going up now about five percent a year, and they  were experiencing that and it really concerned them. One little woman,  struggling to live on Social Security, even told me one time,    Honey, if  my water bill goes up two dollars, I don   t know what I   m gonna do.    So  you can imagine, this was a low and moderate income area for the most  part, and that was a great concern.  There were two attempts during my tenure in the legislature to double  the Vo-tech property tax and can you imagine what that would have  done? The problem began, oh, years ago when the senator in south  Oklahoma City established Oklahoma City Community College. It had a  different name then, but to get the money for the community college, he  called it a vocational technical school in the law. That enabled the  community college to collect the property tax in that designated area in  south Oklahoma City for the operational costs of the college. Well, years  later, Metro-Tech was established, and Metro-Tech has a huge district  which encompasses all of the Oklahoma City school district and  overlaps the community college area. It   s called the overlap district  where the community college overlaps with Metro-Tech and, of course,  Metro-Tech was serving that area without the legal ability to collect any  property tax there. So a couple of times along the way there were bills  filed to allow both the community college and Metro-Tech to collect the  Vo-tech tax. As unfair as that was to Metro-Tech, I just could not stand  by for a double Vo-tech tax on my people to solve a problem that  somebody else had created. That is such a complex problem that there  have been many lawsuits filed and some attorney   s general opinions,  too, on it. It is just very complex.  19  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  This session  2007 , the legislature has devised another solution for the  problem and the bill has already gone through the House and the Senate  and will probably become law. What I compromised during my tenure  was that, okay, the community college could ask the residents in this  overlap area for the incentive Vo-tech tax   that   s over and above what  they   re paying for the operational cost   and the community college  could share that money with Metro-Tech. Well, the community college  never asked for the money because they knew what the outcome would  be in that small overlap   well, it   s not too small, but in the overlap  district. So the bill this year, which will become law I bet, says that  either the community college or Metro-Tech can ask for that incentive  levy and divide it with the other. What will happen, of course, is Metro-  Tech will be the one to ask and a lawsuit in the past was settled and said  that Metro-Tech can ask everybody in the Oklahoma City school  district   whatever it wants to ask them   so what will happen is  everybody in the Oklahoma school district will vote on an incentive levy  for people inside this overlap area. The result will be people outside the  overlap area imposing a tax on the people inside the overlap area, which  those inside have voted against. I don   t know how that   s going to shake  out. But in all fairness, the people outside of the overlap area didn   t  impose the tax on themselves because they already paid the incentive  levy. So it   s a complicated situation, and it never should have happened.  You almost need to have a degree in law to understand some of this,  don   t you?  Well, yes, or you dig and dig and dig and dig.  Read the fine print.  And, you know   when you get really interested and serious about a  subject, people will help you. They will give you information that they  haven   t shared before. At least, that   s what I   ve found along the way.  So you did most of your research, or all of your research, yourself?  Oh, I did. (Laughs)  So you would go to the libraries or to the     Wherever I needed to go   wherever I needed to go. Along the way, I  owned a research and technical writing business for about   I think it  was about eleven years, so I knew where to go and how to find things.  You got to be efficient at it, didn   t you? (Laughs)  20  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Yes.  Were you a chair or vice-chair of any committees while you were there?  Yes, I was chair of the Telecommunications Committee and I spent a lot  of my time on the Energy, Environment, and Natural Resources  Committee. That was the committee with oversight on utilities and the  environment. When I chaired the Technology Committee, which you  know should have been for technology    the telephone issues probably  was what you   d expect   that committee was bypassed for those bills so  it was interesting but not as productive, I should say, as it should have  been.  Several of the other women I   ve spoken with always commented on how  cold the chambers were. Do you remember them being cold,  temperature-wise?  No.  They made the comment that they were cooler because men wore suits,  and they had the temperature adjusted     Is that right? I never noticed it at all. But I usually wore a jacket too.  And some of them started drinking coffee in order to stay warm.  (Laughs) You didn   t notice that either?  No, but I am so focused   (Laughs)  On why you   re there.      you know, that I don   t pay much attention   and it   s amazing that  when the Murrah Building blew up, I didn   t feel it, although some  people did. I was probably so concentrating on something that I didn   t  even notice it.  Would you do it all again?  Oh     Run     Oh, absolutely   absolutely.  No regrets?  21  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  Finchum  Peltier  It   s has been the privilege of my life to serve the people in that district  and if I die tomorrow, I have had a full and happy life, both as a public  servant and as a private citizen.  Well, the state   s better off to have had you both ways.  Well, aren   t you nice   thanks.  Anything else we need to cover?  I can   t think of anything.  I   ve asked all of mine.  I can   t think of a thing.  Well, thank you very much.  You   re most welcome.  Okay.  I appreciate it, too.  ------- -------
