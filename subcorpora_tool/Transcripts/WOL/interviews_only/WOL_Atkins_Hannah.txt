Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m here in Silver Spring, Maryland to  speak with Hannah Atkins who was in the House of Representatives from  1968 until 1980, in Oklahoma. This is part of the Oklahoma State  University Library   s project called    Women of the Oklahoma  Legislature,    and this is June 22, 2007. Thank you so much for talking  with us today.  I   m happy to be a part of your, I started to say campaign. (Laughter) I   m  honored to include my memoirs and history.  We   re glad to have you. Give us a little bit of background, where you  were born and how you came to be in Oklahoma.  I was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, number five in a family  of six children. I was brought up with a very loving and caring mother  and father. They both were well educated, and my father always said     there were the four sisters   he would sit us down and say,    Now you all  are attractive young ladies, and you could get married, but I   m going to  insist that you get at least your bachelor   s degree and I hope you   ll go on  and at least get a master   s.    And, fortunately, each one of us did.  Somehow I was the first of the girls to get married (Laughs) and others  did get married later. I was the only one to have children, and I was a  very proud parent of two sons and a daughter, and now grandma. I have  two grandsons. I keep saying,    I want a great-grandchild. I want a great-grandchild.     (Laughter) But I don   t see that in the near future.  And how did you come to be in Oklahoma?  My husband knew someone. He had a friend there, and they said,    They  need doctors here badly.    And my husband went out there in January  and visited with his friend there, and said,    They really need doctors  5  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  badly. There   s only one doctor here in the African American  community,    and he brought back snapshots of himself and his friend in  shirt sleeves in January. I said,    In January, outside in their shirt  sleeves   that   s the place to be.    (Laughs) I said,    That looks like  Florida.    (Laughs) We got there  Oklahoma  lock, stock and barrel  without my ever having been there. We packed up and had everything  hauled there, and the people welcomed us with open arms. It was like  being in a southern town. Everybody was friendly from day one.  Did you have your children there?  Yes. We were there for    umpteen    years. (Laughs) Yes, indeedy.  And what got you interested in politics?  Well, I   ve always been concerned about things in the community. We  built a house on a hillside and it had a very large patio, and every Fourth  of July I would invite friends out there. We would just sit out there and  have snacks and discuss. One year, an African American who was in the  House of Representatives decided not to run and they were going around  saying who would run, and everybody had a real excuse. So they finally  got to me, and said,    Hannah, you can run. You can run.    I said,    Oh,  no. I wouldn   t want to do that.    But they twisted my arm and so I finally  ended up running and won without any problems.  Was your opponent male or female?  There were several. They were all male. I was the only female running.  And you beat them.  Yes.  Do you remember the day you were sworn in?  I remember the occasion, yes. It was very moving.  There were several who were running at the same time, but when it  boiled down to the last two, my opponent said,    She   s a tea-sipping  lady.    (Laughs) Like that was terrible, you know. In Oklahoma, you  drank beer twenty-four hours a day      She   s a tea-sipping lady,    like  that was something negative, but I won each time. I ran six times and  won each time.  And the day you were sworn in     6  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  My husband, of course, was there, yes. It was a very moving experience.  And the first time you debated a bill on the floor?  I don   t remember it, but I got more bills passed that time than any other  person in the House because I was an early bird. I would go out to the  Capitol early and have breakfast with the    good    ole boys.    At breakfast,  we would sit around while they were sipping on their coffee and decide  who was gonna speak for this bill and who was gonna speak for that one,  and who would vote, and then we would trade off, you know. You vote  for me and I   ll vote for you   and so I got in with the    good    ole boys,     and they didn   t run me away. They let me join in, and if it was a good  bill, I would say,    Yes, I   ll support that.    And sometimes my vote was  the crucial vote, and that   s how the breakfast meetings worked out.  They needed you as much as you needed them.  That   s right, and so many times one vote would make the difference, so I  was inside   outside but not quite inside, but enough inside to get things  done. I got more of my bills passed than anybody else, just by getting up  early and going out there and having coffee with the other legislators.  Well, I had tea, they had coffee. (Laughs) And they still call me the    tea-sipping  lady.    (Laughter)  Did you notice a difference with being a woman   part of the happenings  there?  Of course. They made it a difference. They weren   t accustomed to  having women involved that much in politics. They would get women to  help with their campaigns, but they weren   t inside negotiating on who   s  gonna support this bill and who   s gonna support that, but I was there  involved in everything because I was there early, between 7:00 and 7:30  every morning, yes.  And then stayed how long? Long day?  Of course, legislation wasn   t over early. I   ve always had what I call  good work ethics. I was brought up to, whatever you do, put all your  talents into it. That   s what my mother and father taught us. Don   t  shortchange any job because you end up being shortchanged.  And if you were there twelve years, you ran six times.  And won six times.  You won six, and you chose not to run for the seventh time, correct?  7  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  I was appointed Oklahoma Secretary of State by a republican governor.  Were you the first woman to hold that position, in Oklahoma anyway?  Yes. Governor Bellmon was a republican, and here I was what they call  a,    yellow dog democrat.    He was criticized for that. Others would say,     How dare you appoint a democrat to that high position.    And he said,     She   s the best person for the job,    and that was it.  That was it.  He was very supportive all the way, a wonderful person.  Did you have any problems, besides being a democrat and being a  woman?  Oh, yes. Oh, sure, but I just ignored it. (Laughter) Don   t let things get  you down, if you decide they   re not gonna get you down.  You were involved with the ERA  Equal Rights Amendment  legislation,  trying to get it passed     Oh, yes. Oh, definitely.  And the other woman in the legislature was Jan Turner?  Yes.  And she was against it from what I   ve read.  There was another woman. I was there twelve years so I wasn   t the only  woman all the time     I think during your twelve years, there were eleven. Counting you, there  were twelve different women.  Yes, but not all at the same time.  Not all at the same time. And your children were young at that time and  you could stay at home. Other women had to move   have an apartment  in the city. They were from Tulsa or further out.  Well, my home was way on the outskirts of town, just barely inside of  Oklahoma City. I built there because it was on a beautiful hillside. Then  I found out it was,    Tornado Alley.    (Laughs) My house was hit three  times by a tornado.  8  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Oh, gosh.  And I was there each time alone except once my daughter was there and  I rushed her into one of the bathrooms and so she wasn   t hurt. But once  it took the west wing, once the east wing, then the north wing. The  insurance man said,    Hannah, don   t you get the message? Move.     (Laughs) But my husband just loved that hillside, and so as long as he  was alive, we stayed there. Yes   weathered the storm.  It didn   t run you off. At some point they were trying to change the  abbreviation for the state from O-K-L-A to O-K.  Yes. Yes.  Which one were you for at that time?  Keep it O-K.  That   s been awhile back, hasn   t it?  Yes, indeedy.  And then I read in the newspaper that you were afraid your office phone  had been tapped?  I knew it had been tapped.  You knew it?  Yes. The FBI thought I was a Communist because my motto was,     Planning with People for Progress,    and so if you   re with people, then  you   re a Communist. So they wire tapped my phone for awhile to be  sure that I wasn   t connected with Communists in Russia or somewhere  else. Yes, they did. They thought I was a Communist.  How did you find it, or how did you come to think that it was tapped?  They told me after awhile, they admitted that they were tapping.  Oh, okay.  Yes. Yes, they did.  When you campaigned, who was your campaign manager?  I had several different ones, but     9  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Men or women?     behind the scenes, my husband was the best advisor.  And did you knock on doors and hand out brochures and all that?  Oh, I did that in most of the neighborhoods. You know that Oklahoma  City was very much segregated. There were African American  neighborhoods and whites, and it used to be that on the day of elections,  the big money folks would come with the limousines and pick up people  and take them to vote in the black neighborhoods. But I went around  with my sons and campaigned door to door. They had never been asked  to vote like that by a candidate, and they came. I went to the various  churches and shook hands with people after the ceremonies and all, and  that was something they never had because in those days, big money  would just come over there and take people in their limousines and take  them to vote, and that was it. But I changed that.  I dealt with it person by person. We went door to door, and my little  sons went with me and, of course, they were cute (Laughter) and that  helped people open their doors when they saw this mamma and her  boys. (Laughter) Yes, and I think that   s how I got elected.  At least the first time. The second time, they probably knew you were  doing a good job.  Well, I hope so. Yes, indeedy.  Yes.  Yes. I devoted my time to it.  And do you remember a lady named Texanna Hatchett?  Yes.  She was there for one or two terms     Yes, she was.     I believe, with you.  Oh, yes.  And I don   t know if she was a democrat or a republican, but     10  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  She was a democrat, I think   if I remember correctly.  And then at some point you taught at OSU  Oklahoma State  University ?  I taught at OU  University of Oklahoma , OSU and Oklahoma City  University, all three universities. I enjoyed that very much.  What do you recall about OSU?  Well, the people were very friendly, the staff, and I still hear from some  of the faculty members occasionally   very friendly, and I enjoyed it.  The only problem was I didn   t like driving up to Stillwater and back.  (Laughter) One time my car broke down and if I hadn   t had AAA  insurance, I would have been stranded but fortunately a trooper passed  by and saw me with a flat tire, and he called AAA for me and then drove  me to a service station. People were so nice. Oklahoma is the  friendliest   like a southern town   friendly people.  Where did you teach at OSU? Was it public administration or     Yes, public administration, and I taught at Oklahoma City University  and at OU. Yes.  And you have a library degree?  Yes. I was a librarian. I still am a book-aholic. (Laughter) I still collect  too many books. I gave away about a thousand of them when I moved  here, but we grew up surrounded by books as children, and when my  Dad was in general contracting   when he   d return from South Carolina  or wherever, he   d always bring us books instead of candy and junk  things. He   d bring us books.  And you were a member of the Oklahoma Library Association   s  executive board     Yes.     for awhile? You know this year is its one hundredth year.  Doesn   t time fly? My goodness, one hundred years. I wasn   t here at the  beginning (Laughs).  No, you weren   t.  Not quite.  11  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Not quite. You were a law librarian, is that correct?  I was law librarian there at the State Capitol. That   s how they twisted  my arm and got me to run. They said,    Well, there   s a vacancy. And  since you   ve been the law librarian here, you   d be the top-notch  candidate.     Here I was, a little shy librarian (Laughter) and had to get up   and my  husband was an excellent speaker. He said,    Just find someone in one of  the first few rows and make eye contact with them and then you   re  talking to someone not just a big audience,    and it worked. I learned  how to talk to a group, and I used to tremble very much, being a shy  librarian I dreaded the idea, but I got where I felt comfortable.  And you had to do a lot of that over the years.  Oh, yes, indeedy. Yes I did. I was invited to speak at churches and  schools and everything, and you learn something every place you go.  Did you usually talk about women in politics or just about anything?  Just whatever they asked me to.  And then you went to China?  I   ve been to China, Japan, everywhere   and, of course, all over Europe.  And most of the time the only woman in the group?  Well, not always. Have you heard of Elder Hostel?  Yes.  I frequently travel with that group now because my husband   neither of  my husbands cared to travel, so I felt better traveling with a group like  that where you had a leader and somebody, you know, and you felt safe  that way.  You went with a group of state legislators at one point?  Yes.  You   ve been in some unchartered territories, haven   t you?  Yes, but the main thing is I   ve enjoyed everything that I   ve done and  I   ve learned something every step of the way.  12  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Can you think of anything in particular that you have learned that you  want to share?  I learned that everyone has something to offer. Each person is a unique  individual, and they have something to offer. You can learn something  from everyone.  Well, we can learn something from you.  My dad taught that to us. He said,    Everyone is deserving of respect,     and we will talk to everybody, whether it   s a yard man or a trash man or  whatever, and we were to address them by,    Mister.    We were brought  up that way in the south. My mother and father were very concerned  about giving every human being respect.  How much campaigning finances did you have the first time?  I refused to accept anything more than a hundred dollars. Most of my  money came in at twenty-five dollars or less   lots of small donations. I  refused to accept big money because my dad said,    If you accept, then  you   re obligated to somebody and you should not be obligated to  anyone. You should feel free to vote your conscience,    and that   s the  way I operated.  For all six campaigns?  Oh, definitely, yes.  Campaign finances have gone up.  Oh, my, yes. But I put in some of my money in each one of the  campaigns, too. It got expensive to buy radio time.  And now they   ve got signs they stick up everywhere.  Yes. Oh, yes. Well, I usually would buy radio time when the regular  driving people would be driving home from work. I   d buy radio time for  that, and I knew what the popular radio stations were and with the little  money I had, I would buy that time. I   d buy that early in the campaign  before it all got bought up.  Once you were in the House, did you do some of your own research  when you were pushing a bill through?  Of course. Yes, indeedy.  13  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  That was before they had staff to help with it?  Well, we had staff, but they would be assigned to two or three different  ones. I still hear from one of my staff people.  Really?  Still in touch, yes.  That   s great. Where was your office?  I was on the third floor once and then they moved it around, you know.  And from what I   ve gathered, the chambers were always cold so the  women had to wear an extra jacket or a sweater.  I always came prepared, yes. (Laughter) And one time I brought a  little   one of those little blankets, (Laughs) and one of my seat mates     little son would come in, would run up and hop on my lap, and guess  who? Brad Henry.  Really?  The Governor. And his dad and I were seat mates, and Brad was a little  boy and so much fun. He   s doing a good job as Governor.  He is. You knew a lot of people.  Well, if you   re around there for twelve years     And in politics longer   I mean, in the Secretary of State and then     Oh, yes. Political arena, not politics.  Okay. I learned something today, too.  I would go there every morning and sit down with the old gang at  breakfast time, where we   d decide who would vote for whose bill and  who would sign on as the co-author and all that, and I found that that   s  where you get the work done, in these informal meetings. It   s all just cut  and dry by the time you get to the session open   and I was the only  woman that would be there most of the time. Yeah.  I wonder if anyone else has picked up on that secret?  I don   t know. (Laughter)  14  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  And you were on the Commission on the Status of Women?  Yes.  I don   t really know much about that. Can you tell me about it?  We were trying to push for equality for women because in most of the  occupations, for the same job, employers paid men more than women,  and so we fought that and had success. We were able to pass a bill. It  took a couple of years to get the bill passed, but we did it.  And then someone later started taking out the terms in the statutes that  had to do with gender?  Yes.  So that took awhile, too, from what I understand.  Oh, yes. Yes, it did. You   ve been doing a little research.  A little bit. I   ll have to remember    political arena      instead of     politics.     Yes, indeedy.  And, let   s see, what else? You were a member of the U.S. delegation to  the United Nations.  That was one of the greatest experiences in my life. President Jimmy  Carter appointed me and I occupied the same seat that Eleanor Roosevelt  did. That gave you a tremendous feeling, and to work with the top  officials from all over the world was a terrific experience.  And you had to travel to do that?  New York. The United Nations headquarters is in New York so that   s  where I went. That was a great experience   one of the greatest in my  life.  And how long did you do that?  Four years. I learned a great deal.  You got to shake his  President Carter   s  hand a couple of times, I   ll  bet?  15  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Oh, of course, yes. I still hear from him. Yes.  His was the first presidential race I got to vote in.  Is that right?  And I voted for him.  Now you   re telling me how old you are. (Laughter) Yeah, he was  terrific, caring   he didn   t get the credit that he deserved.  Right.  But he was so quiet and unassuming   and most of them, you know, are  gonna promote themselves, but he was not that kind of person. He was  out to do good, to help people, and he did.  He was a southern gentleman.  Yes. I hear from him and Rosalynn occasionally. Yes, indeedy. I still  make contributions to their foundation, too. They do some good things.  He was an underappreciated president because he was quiet and  unassuming.  So you hear from a lot of people. I   ll bet you have a long Christmas list  when you send out Christmas cards?  Oh, I do. (Laughter) Yes, indeedy.  Okay, and when you were campaigning, you had a group of kids called     Hannah   s Helpers?     Oh, yes. Nobody had ever had that kind of help. They would go door to  door. My sons were kind of the leaders, and that just opened doors for  people who had never had even a politician come directly and ask them  to do it. I would campaign for months going door to door and with my  kids.    Vote for my mom. Vote for my mom.    I was even on TV, and my  dad had predicted that,    You   re gonna be on the front page of the  newspaper,    and sure enough, I was. That was sparked because it was so  unique to see children campaigning for mamma.    Vote for my mom        my little son would carry a sign, and that got people   s eye.  I   ll have to go back and see if I can find the picture from the newspaper.  They have it in the archives at the Oklahoma State University now.  16  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Okay. I   ll look. So    Hannah   s Helpers    were kids about the age of your  son?  Right. They were mostly his friends. Yes.  And did you have, when you were in office, a mentor, a role model for  yourself that you aspired to be like?  Well, Governor Bellmon. I admired him so much. He was republican  and I was what they called a    yellow dog democrat.    But he was a man  of high morals and integrity and really cared about people. He   s the one  that comes to mind. I   m sure I had others, but he was really a good role  model and a strong person. He was criticized when he appointed me  Secretary of State.    Here she is a    yellow dog democrat    and an African  American woman, and you put her in that high position.    He said,    I  want the best person for the job, and she is the best person.    That was it.  What type of things did you do in that position?  Secretary of State? Oh, my goodness   you want   you got a couple of  hours? (Laughs)  Well, just     It was a kind of catch-all   everything would end up on my lap. We had  to, of course, approve businesses   approval and oversaw a number of  state agencies and all. It was a hodgepodge of all kind of things.  Had to manage a budget?  Oh, definitely. Oh, yes. Yes, indeedy. But Governor Bellmon stood up  right there beside me. He said,    She is the best person for the job. That   s  why I appointed her.    That was quite an experience, too. Yes.  Going from eastern North Carolina to being the Secretary of the State   of Oklahoma . That   s a long way.  Yes.  And not necessarily easy.  Not easy. No, no, no, no, no, no. It wasn   t easy. I got hit over the head  all the time, you know. First, I was a woman and then I was an African  American. They will beat you up on those things. Oklahoma was still a  southern attitude. But my daddy told me,    Don   t ever let that stop you.  You have your ambition and you go ahead and do what you think you   re  17  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  cut out to do. Don   t let any of those things stop you,    and I tried to live  that way.  In 1968 a lot of things were going on.  Yes, indeedy.  From Robert Kennedy and     Oh, yes, indeedy.     Martin Luther King and     Oh, yes, indeedy. Yes.  And do you think that impacted your being able to get elected at all?  No.  No?  I think my ability was dependent on going door to door asking people to  vote. They had never been asked directly to vote. Usually in those days,  especially in the African American communities, they would have no  contact till election day and no discussion on what was important. So I  brought a new day to the election there in the African American  community.  The time was just right.  Evidently.  And the Civil Rights Movement had been a couple of years earlier.  It was still going on. Yes, not everybody knew that they could register to  vote. I had lined up some of the registrars and took them around to some  of the areas to register the people, and I visited churches and   didn   t  campaign in the churches, but afterwards, you know, I would go in there  where they held their coffee and cookies, and I would shake hands with  people and everything.  And you participated in a garbage strike?  Of course. (Laughter) Well, you   ve seen that picture, haven   t you? Yes,  indeedy.  18  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  What was that like?  Very upsetting. (Laughter) Here I was a quiet little lady getting hauled  into jail, but a friend said,    Don   t worry. We   re gonna get you out in a  few hours,    and they did.  Well, you were in your mid-forties or fifties when that happened?  I was born in, what   1923, so you can subtract from that.  Early forties maybe.  Maybe. I didn   t feel that old. (Laughter) I still don   t feel old. (Laughs)  I keep saying,    You   re only as old as you feel.    That   s what my daddy  always taught us.  Live to be a hundred.     Live your life to the fullest,    that was his slogan, and we tried to do  that.  Well, how old were they when they passed on   your parents?  My mother was eighty-nine. I don   t know how old my dad was, but I  remember my mother was eighty-nine. That was quite old back in those  days.  You come from a good bloodline.  Oh, yes. Well, my oldest sister is ninety-four, and she still travels all  over the world. She swims every day and she doesn   t give up for  anything.  That   s good.  I think I may have a year or two left. (Laughter)  You did some work for the Department of Human Services in the area of  aging?  Yes.  That must have been interesting.  It was. I visited all of the nursing homes and everything. Well, I had  multiple duties. I also was over the Department of Corrections, so I had  19  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  to visit all the prisons and correctional centers in the state, and I would  make unannounced visits, and you   d be shocked to see what I   d see  sometimes when I   d walk in there. Some of the conditions were really  unbelievably bad. You wouldn   t have an animal living in some of the  conditions and by making unannounced visits, I got them cleared up and  got a few people fired. (Laughs) Yes, indeedy.  I would always tell the correction officer, I said,    The inmates are  human beings. They should be treated with respect as any other human  being. Being incarcerated is punishment enough. You don   t need to treat  them like animals.    And that was the message I would leave.  And you passed some legislation about people that were mentally  incompetent that were charged with crimes.  Yes. We had quite a few of those (Laughs) who committed crimes and  did not know what they were doing. Yes, quite a few.  So you   ve done it all   a lot of stuff.  Well, it   s been an interesting life so far. I   m still enjoying living.  What brought you to D.C.?  To be near my family. My son, Charles, was worried about my being out  in Oklahoma alone, as I had no relatives out there. My friends were  dying off every month. He said,    Mom, we   ve got to get you on the east  coast.    So he pulled up several on his computer and there was one that  was more upscale than this but it was remote. It wasn   t near anything,  and there was another one that I liked better but they had a waiting list of  three years. I said,    I   m not gonna wait three years.    So I settled on this,  and this has been comfortable. I feel safe here. That   s the main thing.  So he   s in the area?  My oldest son has a home in the District  of Columbia . My youngest  son has a home, a little condo on Park Avenue (Laughter) in New York  City, and my daughter is in Delaware, so I   m near     All of them.     all of them, yes. It got to the place where they   d cut back on air flights  to Oklahoma City, and you couldn   t get there sometimes in one day.  You had to sometimes go to Dallas and then back up to Oklahoma City  and all. So I   ve been satisfied here. I feel safe, and I don   t have to cook.  (Laughter) That   s another plus.  20  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Have they tried to elect you to some office?  I decided when I came here I   m gonna keep my mouth shut and just  enjoy being here. I do attend the meetings when we have residents  association meetings, but I   ve been there, done that. I don   t need that  anymore.  So very few of them know what you   ve accomplished in your lifetime.  That   s right. I don   t brag about it, no. I lived it. I don   t have to brag  about it. I   ve enjoyed everything that I   ve done along the way.  Did you go into the legislature thinking you wanted to do something in  particular and then, if so, did you get it done?  Yes, I did. I changed several laws affecting women and minorities, and  also upgraded the nursing homes and the Corrections Department. The  nursing home situation was atrocious, but I was able to make  unannounced visits and got a couple of top people fired, you know, to  really correct it because the nursing home got to be an industry, not a  caring place, and they weren   t giving the people proper food or they  weren   t getting the baths that they needed and things like that. Like I did  at the Corrections Department, I   d walk in unannounced and you   d be  amazed at what you   d see if they didn   t know you were coming.  And how long did you do that?  Let   s see    oh, the years are disappearing, but I think eight years in all. I  did the best I could and Governor Bellmon was wonderful   very  supportive, and if there were any major problems I could go directly to  him and he would exercise his power.  Is there anything you had hoped to accomplish during that time that you  didn   t quite get done?  Well, I wasn   t able to clear out some of the nursing homes that needed to  be closed, but they had big political allies, you know, they were paying  off, but there were some nursing homes that I got corrected up to a point  but really should have been shut down, but I did the best I could with  what I could do.  When you were in the legislature, was there any bill that you tried to get  passed that just couldn   t get over the hump?  Oh, I   m sure there were. (Laughter)  21  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  No major ones that stick out in your mind?  They only come to me at midnight. (Laughs) I   ll call you at midnight  and tell you.  Okay. (Laughter) You do that. You go through a lot in a year   s time   a  lot of bills. A lot of reading.  But as I told you, I would meet with the    good    ole boys    in the morning  at breakfast and we would decide who was gonna support who and  would make the tradeoffs, and I got a lot of mine passed.  And you worked with John Monks?  Yes. He was a very nice person. He was an interesting person. If you get  through smiling at his name, you know   Monks. (Laughs)  And you had a part to play in the women   s caucus?  Oh, yes.  Oklahoma or     Oh, yes, of course. I helped organize it. There wasn   t one because at one  time we only had about two or three women, but as we grew I said,    We  need to exercise our muscle and let them know we   re here.    And we got  bills passed, yes.  How often did you convene with them?  Well, probably about once a week while we were in session. We   d meet  for breakfast, and that was the best time to meet because as the day went  on, you had committee meetings and, of course, the session, so we  agreed to meet early.  Did Senate members come, too?  Oh, sure, yes.  Did it matter if they were a democrat or a republican?  No.  Just had to be a woman.  That   s right. And, of course, there were some things that bypassed the  22  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  democrat/republican aspect and just needed to look at what would  benefit women and correct some of the things that women were missing  out on, yes.  I would like to have been a little mouse listening to all of that back then.  Well, women were not paid the same thing as men for the same job.  That was one of the major things that we fought.  And then something about property    that wives couldn   t claim property  unless     Yes, women were treated like second-class citizens at that time.  In 1972 a group of women campaigned against you   African American  women?  I don   t remember that.  Well, it didn   t work evidently. (Laughter)  No. Nope. There were always    anti    people, you know. If there   s a  campaign, it   s not gonna all be just flushed through.  Did you ever think about running for the Senate     No.     instead of the House?  No. I liked the House. They tried to twist my arm to get me to run for the  Senate, but I said no.  What was the difference between the two then   besides years?  The length of service.  Besides that though     There was a different atmosphere, (Laughs) and the Senate felt that they  were superior to everybody. But I found that you could get more work  done through the House because you could get more support and push it  through faster than in the Senate. Senate would stall around on things.  The House is much more lively.  And there was a time when you were trying to get something passed  23  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  about public housing?  Yes.  And had opposition to that as well?  Of course.  One of my last questions is   when history is written about you, what  would you like for it to say?  I   d like them to say that Hannah Atkins represented the people. She  worked in the interest of people, to give everybody an equal chance at  life and living well.  Well, I   d say she did.  I hope so.  And, if you had to pick one or two top memories of your time in the  political arena, what might they be?  I guess the first one would be the first public speech that I made  (Laughs) and I was so nervous that I almost forgot what I had to say, and  we weren   t suppose to hold a script, but I looked at my husband who  was sitting in the front of the audience, and I took a deep breath and then  it came back to me. They would not permit us to hold a script. I guess  being a nervous little librarian, I was just completely flabbergasted to  see the crowd of people out there. I wasn   t accustomed to making public  speeches but I learned because my husband was a terrific speaker. He  taught me how to make eye contact and speak to somebody   just pick  out somebody in the audience and talk to them, and it worked.  Do you remember what you were talking about that first time?  Oh, no. I don   t remember. Whatever the political topics were     Were at the time?     always were a dozen things you had to talk about.  Okay, what about the last day that you served as a legislator?  Oh, dear, I don   t   it was very moving. So many of my friends came and  patted me on the back and said,    We   re gonna miss you.    Some of the  staff people gave a little farewell party for me and all. So it was a very  24  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  moving experience.  You weren   t leaving the Capitol. You were switching office.  Yes, that   s right. Yes. I still hear from one of my staff members a couple  of times a month, so     What do you consider your greatest accomplishment?  I   ve never thought of it that way.  Probably three successful children.  (Laughter) Yes, indeedy. I just   I think being able to survive. In  Oklahoma in those days, it was quite something, and a female and an  African American. That was quite something, but I was taught   my dad  said,    Wherever you are is where you   re supposed to be. Just hold your  head up and keep going.    And that   s what I did. And he said,    If you  upset somebody, your being there, that   s their problem not yours.    And  that was the way I was brought up and it worked.  Everyone that I   ve asked about you has said that you are a very gracious  lady and one with integrity, and I think they   re correct.  I tried to live that way. That was the way I was brought up. My mother  and father both said,    Honesty is the best policy always, and everybody  is deserving of respect.    We were taught to call our yard man    Mr.    and  the garbage man    Mr.    and we treated everyone with respect. That   s a  southern upbringing.  You   re a good role model for those who came after you.  Well, I hope so.  One in particular   I   ll interview her later   is Vicki Miles-LaGrange.  Oh, yes. I think about her every day   Vicki Miles-LaGrange, yes. She  was one of my prot  g  s way back there. She has done an excellent job as  senator and everything. Yes, indeedy.  I thought you might recognize that name. Did you have any other  prot  g  s?  Well, I   m sure I did but she   s the one that     Comes to the top.  25  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Finchum  Atkins  Yes, indeedy. She   s done so well. Yes. I   m really proud of her.  Is there anything else we need to cover?  Well, I   ll think of it at midnight tonight, and I   ll call you. (Laughter)  Allrighty, well thank you very much for talking with me today.  Well, thank you. I feel very honored to be considered.  ------- -------
