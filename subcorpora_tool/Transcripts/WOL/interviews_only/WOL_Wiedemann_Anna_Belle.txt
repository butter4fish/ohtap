Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  I   m Tanya Finchum. I   m here with Anna Belle Wiedemann and we   re at  her home in Yukon, Oklahoma. Today is May 2, 2007, and we   re going  to be talking about the time she was a House Representative, from 1968  to 1972, elected in 1967 from Canadian County, District 43, correct?  Right.  Alright, and this is part of the Women of Oklahoma Legislature oral  history project being completed by the Oklahoma State University  Library. Okay. I   m so glad you agreed to talk with me today.  Well, I was glad to have you in my home.  Thank you.  It   s been delightful.  First question, bring us up to date a little bit. Tell us about your  childhood, where you were born, date of birth, siblings, that type thing.  Well, you know, you say that you can get,    old as dirt,    and that   s kind  of what I am  (Laughs) I was born on July 22, 1931 in a country home  near Piedmont, Oklahoma. And I had wonderful parents. Growing up at  that time, we had no electricity and no telephone, but we did have  propane for our heating. I had two sisters, one that was two years older  than I am and one that was four years younger than I am. At that time,  when you   re out on the farm, someone always asks if my parents had  problems with us children. Well, when you   re fifteen miles from the  largest town, which was El Reno, the county seat, we didn   t go to town  very much   so no, we did not get into trouble. (Laughs)  I think that maybe we were the happiest people going at that time  5  because I remember when Rural Electric Co-Op came in and brought  electricity to our home. I was about seven years old and what a joy it  was to have electricity. All of the sudden, we didn   t have the ice man  anymore that came and brought the block of ice to put in the  refrigerator   that is why it was called an ice box back then.  As time went on, the school that I went to for grade school was Racine,  and it was a fourth of a mile south of the house. It was set on the  property, so we walked to school every day. I went my full eight years to  the rural school and the last three of those eight years, there were only  three students in that school. When I took my county exam, at that time,  the county superintendent came in and gave the exam to you. That exam  determined whether I could go on to high school   and I was third  highest in the county. The two that defeated me for salutatorian and  valedictorian was a brother and a sister, now isn   t that something? And  they were country schools also. So I knew that I had to pass that test  because I didn   t want to stay in that one-room school the next year.  After passing the test, I went to high school in Okarche. During high  school, we didn   t have FFA but agriculture was always a prominent  thing in my life because that   s what my father did and my mother always  had a lot of chickens. I wanted to take agriculture, so the last two years  the school offered a course in agriculture, and there were only two girls  in that class. But FFA still wasn   t prominent at that time and it was not  taught in the schools, so I never was an FFA member but later here in  life, I   ve belonged to their alumni group and supported their efforts and  became one of their heroes, as I call it.  After graduating from high school, my sister went to OSU  Oklahoma  State University  and she became an elementary teacher and a special  education teacher. In some cases, you hate to say that you didn   t  particularly get the education you wanted, but my parents at that time     there was not a lot of money to go around and my younger sister went to  Draughn   s Business School, and I married.  I married Carl after I got out of high school, and we moved to a farm  that was on school land. His dad had rented this school land for many  years, and just before we got married, someone had rented another little  house that we were going to move into, so we lived one month or so  with his parents. And you know usually that   s a disaster, (Laughs) but  Carl had the most wonderful parents that one could ever have, and so  then we moved on down to the school land after we cleaned up a little  that was on it.  On my nineteenth birthday I stood there in the yard at his folks   , because  we helped them milk the cows, and Carl was going to farm with his  6  Finchum  Wiedemann  father that day, which he normally did. I reached in my pocket and I had  a dime, a thin dime, and that was about all we had. We had no money,  you know, but we were in love (Laughs). And after I stood there and  saw the milk truck come in to pick up the milk cans that we had  processed for the delivery man, Mr. Briscoe, I felt this dime in my  pocket, and here came his sister and brother-in-law driving in and they  had a long house trailer. They were coming back from the war in  Germany where his brother had worked for the postal department. They  were driving a new Lincoln car that was pulling this trailer, and as I  reached back down in to get this thin dime, I thought,    Well, now I have  not gone to college like a lot of them would or could. I worked there on  the farm, but someday I would own a farm and drive a Lincoln.     (Laughs) I put a goal in my head, you know, because I knew that we  were going to have to work.  Later, I got a job outside the farm and worked for Dr. Leroy Goodman  who had an office on Main Street in Yukon. He was a precious doctor as  a lot of his patients, if they had no money, didn   t have to pay him. If  they had money, it was three dollars for an office call, and he was just  like a father to Carl and I. I worked for him for about five years and then  we rented some more land and just kept saving. I made ninety-nine  dollars a month working for Dr. Goodman.  Then, I got a small job in Oklahoma City with Rothchilds  Kansas City  based department store with several locations in Oklahoma City  and  rode the bus from Yukon to Oklahoma City for fifty cents a day. I kept  saving and we had a lot of chickens and cattle on the farm. When we  still lived on the school land, we had to pump all the water by hand.  Then my parents decided to move to El Reno and we acquired their  estate at this time. We moved there and began to expand the farm. Then  his folks passed away and they put their place up for auction and we  were fortunate enough to acquire it. As the years have gone on, we   ve  just kind of put what we call the Slash C Ranch together, and it consists  of about three sections of land through here now.  Did you ever get your Lincoln?  Yes. Did I get my Lincoln? Someone else asked me. Yes, I got my  Lincoln and I own that ranch. (Laughs) And that   s why I say a goal is so  important. I always thought that if I didn   t get that college education,  and I regret it, but I had to work twelve hours a day if they worked eight,  so I was going to make it up in hours. I read everything I got my hands  on and I say that you can certainly   at that time, I think you could do  okay, but now you must have that education.  It   s just   I don   t know if I would have done any different if I went to  7  college because farming and ranching is in our blood. When we moved  to   I call it the home place that we acquired at Piedmont, Okarche     they have two addresses there   we had 1,300 chickens that I took care  of every day, laying hens, and I really enjoyed it and that stemmed from  4-H. I had chickens in 4-H and G. H. Ware of OSU was always the one  that helped us a lot with the type of chickens that we had, and it turned  into a business for me. We run a lot of cattle and Carl was very good in  taking care of them   and we   ve always done our own work. I drove the  wheat trucks for fifty-some years, and enjoyed every bit of it. We always  talk about tipping, and I always laugh and say,    You know, I don   t mind  tipping. I know they work for tips. But I never got a tip when I drove  that wheat truck across the scales. Nobody ever gave me a tip for  bringing that wheat in.    (Laughs)  As time went on, I was active in extension work and that was our  learning process of how to cook and sew and do outside work. One day  when the House of Representative position was being thought about and  there had been a fellow that had been in District 43, Canadian County,  for about twelve, thirteen or fourteen years   the people of El Reno came  out one day with the district judge and wanted me to run for the House  of Representatives. I said,    I can   t do that. We farm and ranch and we   re  partners, Carl and I, and we had a lot of hogs also.    And he said,    We  need you. You know more about the rural community and the towns  than anyone since you   ve worked in all the aspects.    They felt like I was  well respected in the community and so I said,    No, I   m just not  interested.    They came back the night before the last day of filing and  the next morning. Judge Whelan came, picked me up and took me to the  Capitol. He paid my fee, and that   s how I got into the House of  Representatives.  At that time, women had to be a third to a half better. I mean this  sincerely because people weren   t ready for women in public office, and  you didn   t see as many, and especially in 1967 or 1968. I knew I had to  overcome that and also had to overcome an incumbent that had been in  office twelve years or more. I also had to overcome being a lady. I just  put on a white dress that had a red, white and blue little seam around and  that   s how I campaigned. I washed it every night and we campaigned  every day.  I was a democrat and a republican filed also. He was the mayor of El  Reno, the largest town in Canadian County. So I had to run in the  primary and then I had to run in the general election. My tongue was  hanging out and I was stepping on it, (Laughs) but I overcame the  incumbent and the mayor and being a woman   it was just unbelievable.  They couldn   t believe it. So it was a hard race and, of course, our  daughter was about six, I believe, when I was elected. And actually, you  8  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  know, you hate to go off and leave them but I had a good thing because I  could stay home. Oklahoma City was not far away and I drove back and  forth every day. But you have many, many long hours, and I ran the next  two years serving until 1972. Then with redistricting, they took out my  home town of Piedmont because Oklahoma City expanded so much and  I lost a third of my good supporters. We had the 18-year-old vote at that  time and a young man ran against me. I think I lost by sixty or ninety  votes   something like that.  Not much.  It was probably the best thing that ever happened because I had a good  rapport with all of the House of Representatives, and the fellows treated  me just as one of them because I had a strong foundation in agriculture.  Several bills that I pushed through still exist and have helped the  community.  Can you tell me about the day you were sworn in   some of your  thoughts and feelings?  Yes, the day I was sworn in was     The first time, I guess.  Yes, the first time, I had a light blue suit on. I can remember that so very  vividly. The office I was assigned to was on the fourth floor. The  democrats were in control of the House and there were probably sixteen  republicans. When you have that few of the other party, you pretty well  control what is going on. So I had a good location for my office. You go  by seniority or by the party you were elected with at that time. I was on  fourth floor, so I could walk around the corner and go into the House  chamber. I shared my office with two seasoned House members   Ray  Trent and Spencer Bernard. Of course Spencer Bernard became  lieutenant governor later and Rex Privett was named Speaker of the  House at that time. So I had some good committee assignments and a  good office. The three of us shared an office and also shared a secretary,  but I never was skirted around that I could ever say, being a female. I  was never treated any different. I was never denied anything that  people   a lot of them say, you know, were denied and I never saw  anyone because of race, creed or color be excluded or denied of  anything. The Speakers of the House were gentlemen when I was there.  How many other women were there when you were there?  I believe there was three others   Pauline Tabor, Texanna Hatchett, and  Hannah Atkins.  9  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  So they didn   t group you all together, you didn   t have to share an office?  No. Pauline was from southeast Oklahoma. She had been in the  legislature quite awhile and her projects were different than mine.  Texanna was a republican, and Hannah was from the black community  and a really delightful lady. I   ve often wondered about the other two. I  believe they   re deceased. I     I   m not sure.  Describe a typical day. How early would you get up and go and how late  would you stay?  A typical day would be   committee meetings sometimes started at  seven     a.m.?  7:00am   and sometimes your evening meetings take place at 6:00 or  7:00pm and wouldn   t end till about 10:00pm. So once you really got  through the first week or two at the beginning of session and you   re deep  into it, you would have had four hard days every week, Monday through  Thursday. Then Friday we usually didn   t meet, but you never ate a hot  meal in your life (Laughs) because the phone rings all the time at home,  and that   s what we   re there for. We are working for the public. It   s the  taxpayer   s money. And then on Friday or Saturday night, you always  had somewhere that somebody wanted you to be, a banquet or whatever.  My husband went to many things with me, but they always thought he  was a lobbyist in the background a lot of times and never knew who he  was. He brought home more information than I did   My first session was with Governor Bartlett, a republican, and the  second was with Governor Hall, a democrat, so I knew kind of both  sides of it at that time, of the republicans and democrats. And then later  when I was in the Department of Agriculture, Governor Bellmon was  back in office and he certainly was a friend of mine. I enjoyed him very  much and worked with him a lot on different agriculture projects, so   of  course, he was in the U.S. Congress and worked with us very closely.  Do you remember the day you presented your first bill on the floor?  Well, you   re up and down with so many, and you co-author so many,  but one was a bill that declared we could have wineries in Oklahoma. At  that time, I think they could make up to 200 gallons, and I had one in my  district that wanted to become a larger winery and that was the Schwartz  Winery.  Everybody knows the Schwartz Paving Company and their father began  10  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  the Schwartz Winery at Okarche. Representative Heber Finch had one at  Sapulpa, so we had two in the state. We got our bill up and passed it and,  of course, now we have 68 wineries, I believe, in the state. Today, the  bill needs some work because things have changed. I was asked the  other day why I didn   t include that they could ship their wine or sell it at  different places because it includes provisions where they can   t, but back  then it wasn   t necessary. So, you know, times change but that   s one of  them I worked very hard. I also worked hard on highways although I  wasn   t on the committee, but road projects were very big. One of my big  efforts was to raise the highway north of Yukon and straighten the  correction line because every time the rain came, it flooded and no one  could get across the river to Yukon or back, and so we got that road  accomplished   and, oh, a lot of educational bills that we worked on.  Did you do your own research when you were presenting a bill?  We did some and then we gave it to a research committee, but we didn   t  have near the research that they have now     Or the computer     Yes, we didn   t have computers at all in there, and so much of it was  done before computers. Back then, we didn   t have electronics in the  House and the speakers that come into your office to know what was  going on. It all was done by pages and your secretaries. And for your  bills mostly the secretaries typed all day long, you know. They were  really busy and we had some very good assistance, but the House, I  would say has grown ten-fold with research and     Staff support?  Yes, staff support. And not criticizing   because the whole country has  grown ten-fold. I always say,    If you don   t take progress by the hand,  it   ll take you by the neck.    So when these new things come in, you need  to be sure to research and look at it. It may not be for us but there   s so  many bills to go through, and a lobbyist is very important to you because  if you   re given a 150 page bill and it   s going to come up on the floor in a  few days or a week or two weeks, usually there   s a lobbyist that comes  to assist you and tell you what   s in that bill. You have to trust someone  and if that lobbyist one time crosses you and tells you wrong, you   re not  gonna deal with him, and he probably won   t get in your door again.  Lobbyists have always had a bad name in a way. You know, it is the  perception that they are out to scheme or whatever, and that   s not true.  They are very important people, and that was one thing   about the first  day that I went to the legislature, why Rex Privett said to me,    A  lobbyist is very important   they can help you in every way and you   ll  11  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  find out which ones you want to deal with.    That   s why you see so many  lobbyists around the legislature because on whatever bill, whether  you   re on a farm bill, an oil bill, an education bill or whatever, someone  is hired to assist that company to tell you what it   s all about.  Other than him, was there someone else during your first six months or  so that you considered your mentor?  I would say my two office mates, Ray Trent from Midwest City and  Spencer Bernard, and later Wayne Sanguin was also in my office, and he  was a very close friend of the Speaker and, of course, you know, that  helped me a lot. But I was glad that I had a secretary that had been there  for several years because she was so much help. That along with the two  or three men   there may have been four of us in the office at that time,  Wayne and Ray and   you would hear them talk, and you would know  what was going on around in the chambers and outside.  In the evenings at that time we had what we called a    cheese room.    The  cheese room was usually at the Eighty-Niner Inn or one of the other  hotels depending on which one gave us a free room. We   d have cheese  and Spencer Bernard   he raised peanuts so he always brought peanuts.  We would all sit around and discuss what was going on, both democrats  and republicans, and not scheme but just talk about was in the other  committees and what you could do and if there was a way that your  friend could vote with you on your bill. We had a nice relationship that  way. It would last about an hour, but as soon as we dismissed from  session we would head to the cheese room and spend an hour or so that  way.  Debriefing in a way.  Right. And usually no one else showed up. Bringing wives or  husbands   that was usually a    no-no.    It was just kind of a little business  session that we could do at that time.  Did you do that your entire time that you were there?  Yes, we did that the entire time. They don   t have that, I understand,  anymore.  No one has said that. You   re the first one      Maybe I wasn   t supposed to tell that secret. (Laughs) Sometimes we  would enjoy products that were grown in Oklahoma or stuff that others  dropped off but overall it was a very helpful secret and a really good  way to learn.  12  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Sure.  We provided our own ideas and input. We didn   t have to vote for  something we didn   t want. All of our members contributed.  Do you stay in touch with any of those legislators from that time period?  Yes, I stay in touch with most of them but I believe sixty to seventy  percent are dead from my first session. And that   s sad to say. I have to  look at the pictures again, but I had a seat mate, Bill Jones  William G.  Jones , from southeast Oklahoma from the first session. The second  session   s was Donald Coffin from Guthrie, Oklahoma who owns Granny  Had One, the restaurant. And your seat mates are important. Bill was a  lawyer and he helped a lot in the law side at that time or you would ask  Donald. It   s nice to have a good seat mate because things move pretty  fast and you always have to remember that you   re dealing with people   s  businesses and their lives. It   s the most important body that controls the  whole state.  Do you get a certain feeling when you walk up the steps into the  Capitol?  Yes, you know, the Capitol is always just a great institution and the  nation   s Capitol   when you fly there   you can be there so many times  and your heart just goes out. But yes, the State Capitol is very dear to  me. I just can   t believe that I spent some time there. George Nigh was  always a good friend and still is and was also a good governor and  senator and house member   whatever you want to call him.  Do you have a favorite moment, or two?  Oh, I don   t know that I have a favorite moment or two. I had an uncle  that considered my service in the House as a favorite moment of his  because he served in the U.S. House of Representatives.  After you or before you?  He served before me. He chopped cotton and kind of came up, you  know, through the ranks as you   d say. He never thought he   d ever be in  Washington, and so I always heard from him a lot, and never dreamed  that I   d would run for political office. Of course, Judge Whelan was a  distant relative and he always made sure that I was treated right.  Looking at favorite moments, all of them were. Even some of my bad  feelings and experiences have become favorite moments because it  helped open your eyes and ears to see that good people serve in  government, and 99.9 of politicians are good people and their intentions  13  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  are to serve their community.  Let   s go back to your first campaign. Was your campaign manager a  friend or male, female or     He was a male   Bruce Haynes at El Reno. At that time, we didn   t  handle very much money. It was done by handshakes and knocking on  doors. He kept me advised of things because he was in the Kiwanis  Clubs and knew where to steer me and what to do, and I didn   t have  large reports on money because my whole campaign maybe cost  2,400.  The first one?  And the next one wasn   t that much either. I had people willing to give,  and there was no need if everything was paid. So we just didn   t handle a  lot of money back then. We walked the streets and talked to the people.  Did you have a slogan?     Ring the Bell for Anna Belle.    (Laughs) Everybody comes to me still  and says that that know me, but I never had any large donations. I  always said I   d rather have a thousand one dollar bill donations than  have one  1,000 donor because those that contribute one dollar to you  really mean that they want you to be there. Those are the people that  came up and are concerned. I always carried my hometown of Okarche  where I went to school and always said,    I only lost three votes up  there.    (Laughs) And, you know, that always speaks well for you, when  you are raised in a community and they support you wholeheartedly.  From El Reno, so you would have spent some time in the Carnegie  Library there?  Yes, yes. It is very nice and I think they   re getting ready to re-do some  of that building now. I have always enjoyed working with the black  community in El Reno. They had a good say as long as I was there. El  Reno College was another thing that I supported very heavily. It was  first in the old post office building downtown, and I remember a time  when Dr. Harrison, the president of the college then, came to me and  needed some funding. I said,    Well, we   ll get the appropriations and  budget chairman together and talk to them to see if there is any way.     We were able to get Dr. Harrison and the appropriations budget together  and we sat down, had a piece of pie and talked about it. When we left, I  often had to laugh, because Dr. Harrison said,    I don   t believe that guy  understood a thing I said.    And I said,    Oh, yes.    And he got his  appropriation.  14  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  So, you know, it   s just one-on-one knowing people but campaigning is  hard. I   ll tell you, when you knock on that door, it was easier then  because people answered their door. Television wasn   t the thing because  you couldn   t advertise on television. Newspaper ads were killers due to  cost. Those ads were the most expensive part of your campaign, but  people read the newspaper, so they were necessary.  Did you have signs?  Yeah, I had a lot of signs. A lot of signs that were, oh, about eleven by  thirteen or so, on stakes that we would put out. Most of the big ones  were homemade signs. The others were done by a company that we paid  and we had a few bumper stickers, but I   m not a bumper sticker person.  Didn   t want one on your Lincoln, did you?  No, I didn   t want one on the Lincoln or for them to put it on their  vehicles. I may be the candidate for them, but I never asked people to  really put a bumper sticker on. Also, I never asked anyone to endorse me  in the newspaper. If I lost, I didn   t want to drag them down with me.  (Laughs) I always was concerned about the well-being of the other  person. I never wanted to ever drag the other candidate down, so I just  went with my motto,    Ring the Bell for Anna Belle.     Do you think your voters were mostly   female and male?  Female and male, but a female vote is hard to get.  Even then?  Even then, probably. You know, I don   t know why females don   t  support females harder. I always say that you can have ten standing there  and a lot of times, you know, a female can help you so much. But, I have  had other females tell me that maybe the instinct of a female is  jealousy   I don   t know. But it shouldn   t be that way. I always say,    If  someone makes a good move, maybe there   s another place for you and  they can help you get where you would like to achieve that goal.    If  you   re working for money and that person is successful, they may help  you be successful in the same way, so I never walk into a room and  apologize if I   m the only female in that room. I don   t notice that. I   m  there for the purpose of doing the job that I was sent there to do and, like  you say   I   m a loner in a certain way. I love people and I love to be out  with them, but I can also take a trip by myself and have a good time.  (Laughs)  Did you chair any committees?  15  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  No. I served as a vice chairman at that time. We didn   t have many  woman that chaired committees among the four of us women, but I was  vice chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee, which included  banking, consumer credit and all of those areas. I also served as the  liaison between the Agriculture Committee and the Department of  Agriculture, and did a lot of work in that area. And of course, later, you  know, I was appointed county commissioner during the county  commissioner scandals by Governor George Nigh at that time     And how long did you do that?  I just did that for a short time because that wasn   t what I wanted to run  for. I represented Canadian County   s district two, and before I finished, I  lost all my commissioners to the    situation    as we call it. I served as  chairman, vice chairman   I was everything but couldn   t transact much  business so I set up the election and there was a lady that was elected at  that time.  After that, I also lobbied for a couple of years representing the  conservation districts. The conservation districts knew that I was  familiar with how to tap the right areas for funding. At that time there  were 85 districts all over Oklahoma. I carried a lobbying license, I guess  you   d say at that time. After traveling quite a bit, my husband Carl did  too   someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I would be  interested in working as the International Marketing Coordinator at the  Department of Agriculture, because the position was open. And I said,     Well, I   m, you know, not really sure that I would be.    But I did go to  work right after that in September of 1983 and became a Market  Coordinator for International in the Department of Agriculture. Then in  1984, I became the Director of Marketing and International Marketing. I  took over that area and stayed there until 1994 or 1995, I believe. I  decided to move on and started the Rural Development Committee for  the Department of Agriculture, and knew that I was going to retire about  a year later after that, so we got it going and that   s what most people see,  you know,    Made in Oklahoma,      the little logos and    Buy Oklahoma,     that came from me.  That   s you?  That   s me. It came from our office and I worked with most of the  farmer   s markets and we had about ten or fifteen when I came there and  got it up to around thirty-five, forty of them.  You   ve been going for quite a while, haven   t you?  Yes, sure have. And so that was another good thing that happened.  16  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  So since retirement, what have you been doing?  Well, I still do a little agriculture consulting. My phone still rings a lot.  I   m always telling them call their representative, (Laughs) but I   ve done  a lot of traveling and had the opportunity to go with President Carter   s  son, Chip Carter, to Israel, Egypt, Syria and Jordan   and just got out of  there before that heavy war started. I   ve also spent a month in Vietnam  and traveled from the north to the south quite a bit covering a lot of area.  I   ve traveled to around sixty-some countries and continue to keep my  passport up, but I   ve tried to do quite a bit in the U.S. recently. Then we  have what we call the Slash C Ranch here, and it   s still very big. We  have several   almost 2,000 acres of wheat out that the boys do.  Do you still drive a wheat truck?  No, I don   t drive a wheat truck anymore. About five or six years ago, I  did it every year and now we leave it to the young boys that lease who  are delightful. They run a lot of cattle and plant a lot of wheat, and we  have a lot of alfalfa.  You watch the weather a lot.  Watch the weather   everything hinges on the weather for us. And we   re  proud of the ranch because we kind of keep it tidied up and have about a  twenty-five mile circle. It   s not all in one contingent area but we are in  Canadian and Kingfisher County. Being this close to the city, you can   t  buy land that joins but we have a lot of housing developments around us  now, and don   t intend to sell. We   re ranchers and farmers, so that   s what  we want to do. Carl has never drawn another paycheck but his own. He   s  been devoted to farming and ranching, and he   s an avid hunter. In  September he went bear hunting in Maine and got a black bear. But what  makes you think about your life, you know   your family is important.  Our daughter has two children and they   re both getting college  educations. One just graduated from hotel and restaurant business  management, and the other one is in cosmetology. Our daughter teaches  for Francis Tuttle Vo-Tech and is starting her twenty-second year, I  believe. She was a surgical nurse for nine years prior and has several  degrees and is currently finishing another, I believe, in land management  with Colorado State through the Internet. She   s gonna get her bachelor   s  degree in it, I think, in December.  And she   ll take over the ranch?  Well, she   s ready   she   ll take over the ranch when her time comes.  She   s an avid bow-hunter and killed two black bear   s with a bow or I  17  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  guess maybe one with a bow and the other with a gun, but yeah, two  black bears   Any aspirations to go into politics?  No. (Laughs) She was small when I was campaigning and when a dog  came out to bite her, she threw her stuff down and she said,    Don   t ask  me to campaign any more.    So now, she has no aspiration of going into  politics. Every once in awhile, I will mention it, and she would rather be  involved with wildlife and game and those areas. But, she   s really  devoted to Francis Tuttle. She loves every portion of her job, along with  the faculty and her superiors     She   s giving back to the state, too, in that regard.  Yes, she really is.  Would you have any advice for women that were thinking about politics?  Or young girls that     I think the opportunity is out there for any young girl, young lady. I  think you have to focus on and be sincere about what you   re going to  run for. You know, just to be in politics is not the answer. We see this  every once in awhile whenever eight or ten or so are on the ballot and  it   s because,    I want a job,    and that   s not what the house of  representatives, the senate, or the governor   s office is about. It is not,    I  want a job.    It is about wanting to serve the people and if you are there  to strive for something that has irritated you over the years or it may be  just one project   your project, nobody else   s, that   s not a good enough  reason. So that   s why people usually say they are there for education,  health and other things.  And we have some real problems. We   re going to have to fix the health  problem. My criticism of the legislature involves the surpluses. At that  time we only had, I think,  27 million in surplus. We   re now in the two,  three, four hundred million surpluses so why not fix a large project for  three or four years like the teacher   s retirement, or just take one time to  get that thing turned around   one big appropriation? Look at our  lodges   we shouldn   t have ever let them run down like they did. If an  independent can make them work, the State of Oklahoma could have  made those work, which we already owned, and completed that project  one year   put so many million into those projects and brought them up  to snuff. Now we   re beginning to work on the bridges and highways and  so forth. Now our traffic is so tremendous that we   ll barely keep up  because, you know, we used to not have the traffic, but we   ve got to  think back to traffic and see that everything is changed. We   re on a fast  18  Finchum  Wiedemann  pace, with more cars, more everything, more students. I don   t like to see  the bond issues any more on my tax roll than anybody else, but  something   s got to give, and we   ve got to educate and it has to be done. I  don   t know where it   ll stop, you know. It   s if I left for ten years and  came back, I wouldn   t recognize my community I   m sure.  Sounds like you might need to run again.  Oh, no   I   m too   you know, you get a few years on you. I don   t like to  ever call myself    old    because I   m not. I like to think young and still  like to get out and do things. What will set you back   it will be thirty  months, maybe thirty one, my husband was diagnosed as having  pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is just about the last resort as you   d  say, and he found out that he had it after buying a farm south of El Reno,  about thirty months ago or more. It had bindweed on it and we sprayed  and then planted it back to wheat. He rode the fence lines to see if there  was any bindweed out in this field and, in doing so, got pneumonia and  was in the hospital about six days. As he got ready to come home, he  kind of chucked up and doctor said,    Carl, are you sick?    And Carl said,     No, everybody gets an upset stomach,    and he said,    No, let   s see you  Monday and let   s just take another look.    So they did a scope and they  came out and told me he had pancreatic cancer and that OU Medical  Center would be calling us and not to call them   that the world   s best  was right there.  And, you know, how you go home? I   ve been in government and I  thought maybe that government person won   t call me. (Laughs) Tuesday  morning we saw this doctor and the next day they called and told me  that they   d see him on the following Tuesday at OU Medical Center and  I thought,    Oh, happy day.    The doctor he was going to see was Russell  Postier. He was an OSU graduate and an OU graduate and from back  East, and just got in there to have Carl looked at, and Carl was feeling  fine. Then the fire alarm went off and we all had to get out of the  building. After the alarm, we come rushing back in and the doctor, he  came right out and took hold of my hand and took hold of Carl   s  shoulder and said,    Don   t leave. I want to see you now.    So he took us  back in and Dr. Russell Postier set him up there and said,    Carl, why are  you here?    And Carl said,    I don   t know. I think it   s time to go home,     just kind of kidding him, because that   s Carl. Carl is kind of a laid-back  man, and the doctor said,    Well, let me tell you why you   re here. You  have nine months to live if you go home, and if I operate on you, we   re  going to do a Whipple  name of the procedure which includes the  removal of the gallbladder, common bile duct, part of the duodenum,  and the head of the pancreas , and that takes part of your pancreas and  five percent die on the operating table. I   m gonna have to tell you this  because it   s not an easy operation, and then you can do as you wish.     19  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  And Carl said,    Well, you didn   t give me very good options. Well, I   m  gonna let you kill me now.    And the doctor just took out his palm pilot  and scheduled him to the medical center, and the following Monday they  rushed him   you know, just kept hurrying all this   and we were there  about a month. He got the surgery and it took about seven hours, and  he   s completely cured   just a miracle. They wrote him up in the journal,  I guess, and Dr. Russell Postier when he saw him   why I know it was  thirty months, we were in two weeks ago and Dr. Russell Postier said,     Thirty months and no sign at all in his blood,    and they call him  completely cured.  Thanks to pneumonia, I guess.  Yeah, it was good   and so, you know, here   s how farming can help you.  We bought the farm, rode the fence lines and got pneumonia. If we  never bought the farm and had pneumonia, he   d never have known  about the cancer so he said he wouldn   t sell that farm on a bet. It saved  his life. But from just the time to finding out about it to surgery on his  pancreatic cancer   it was about the size of a pea and in that week and a  half span had grown to the size of a golf ball.  Grows quick.  Really quick   and then he did another experiment at the same time on  his pancreas. When you fool around with the pancreas, you have to take  insulin to wake it up. After fifteen days of giving Carl insulin, he said,     That   s all the needles I can stand.    He was kidding them, and they quit,  but his pancreas woke up and he doesn   t take insulin now either so he   s  a lucky, lucky man   really is. So we   ve had a real journey, a life   s  journey, and politics has been very good to me.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say  then? That   s my last question.  She was there to help someone else   truly there.  Is there anything I need to ask you that I haven   t? Anything you wanted  to cover that we haven   t?  No, not especially. I always   very seldom talk about all my life.  (Laughs)  You   ve done great.  Very seldom. I always say,    There   s others a lot greater than I am.     About two years ago, probably one of the nicest things that happened to  20  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  Finchum  Wiedemann  me. I was voted the    Cattlewoman of the Year    from the Oklahoma  Cattlewomen   s Association.  And mother of the year, if I remember correctly.  Yes, voted in 1991 as    Oklahoma Mother of the Year,    and that was a      a good honor.  So, I   d say a lot of people will be saying you were there to help them  along.  I was also voted as    Citizen of the Year    here   I forgot what year, for  Canadian County.  Do you still have that dime?  Yes. (Laughs) I have two or three thin dimes, I always tell people. I  supported a lot of college and educational programs that people don   t  know where it came from, and that   s always good. I had a lady one time  that came to me and she worked a lot with the veterans and did a lot with  the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, and she  wanted to go see her mother and didn   t have any money. Her mother  was dying and I   at that time, you know, the planes didn   t fly that  much, and I bought the bus ticket and sent her on her way. It was at that  time not quite a hundred dollars, and just before she passed away, she  sent that hundred back.  That   s sweet. Now you can use it to help someone else and keep it going.  You   re an amazing lady. I hope I can be sitting there in a chair when  I   m your age, too, and be able to say     I   m sorry.  That   s okay. Thank you very much, and we   ll cut this off before you get  any more teary-eyed. (Laughter) That was great. You did very well.  Thank you.  ------- -------
