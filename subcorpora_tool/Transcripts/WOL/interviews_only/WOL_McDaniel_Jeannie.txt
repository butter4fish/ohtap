Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Today is October 15, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m at the  OSU-Tulsa Library to speak with Jeannie McDaniel who is in the House  of Representatives here in Oklahoma. She was elected in 2004 and re-elected  in 2006. This interview is part of the OSU Library   s project  entitled Women of the Oklahoma Legislature. So thank you for joining  us today. My first question is really about your childhood. What was it  like? Where were you born? Tell me a little bit about your family life.  Well, I was born in Ohio in a rural farming community. And probably  the two single, biggest influences in my life were my grandmothers     just the salt of the earth, hard workers. I spent a lot of time with them  and really learned about community service, about the role of religion in  your life, the role of the weather for farmers and looking back through  the years, I have to say it was pretty strong family ties and which has  served me to this day. So things in my family revolve around food and  fun and being together and probably our happiest memories are when  we   re together and we   re all talking at the same time. And we have  saved recipes. We have preserved just a lot of things from our past and I  think it   s served as a great foundation.  How many brothers and sisters do you have?  Well I had a, I guess, dysfunctional family by many standards but I  didn   t know it. I have two real brothers, two half-brothers and two step-brothers.  And so     No sisters?  No sisters. And at the age of five, my parents divorced and my mother  moved us to a large city where I took dancing lessons, music lessons   I  was a clarinet player for ten years. I rode a bus, public transportation,  5  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  lived in an apartment and actually then went to twelve schools in twelve  years. Moved a lot and when she re-married, my step-father of over fifty  years now was in the military. And so through the Bay of Pigs, through a  lot of different states and Air Force bases, my family moved and my  mother became a school teacher. I actually graduated from Grand Forks,  North Dakota High School. So all of that made me think on my feet and  make friends quickly and generated a great love of reading because it  was my way to see the world. And wherever I went, no one could take  that away from me. I think that really helped me to grow and to  appreciate education, but also to appreciate people of all cultures, all  religions.  Looking back, it was a great foundation. I don   t think we could have  planned it. But I was a Girl Scout, I did all of the typical things that I  think kids in my generation did. And we all were really aimed toward  college. But at the time, I think making the world a better place to live  was something our parents instilled in us. No matter what we did  education-wise, that we would give back. And so when you watch your  parents do that and being scout leaders to picking up trash to  volunteering a lot and you grow up with that, from your grandparents on  you realize that   s what makes the world a better place.  So you visited the library a lot?  At one point in my little town of 600 people, I tried to read every book  in the library. But at that time I was only there in the summers later and  so I didn   t quite get that goal. I also found attics of my grandmother  where there would be books, The Girl of the Limberlost   just all kinds  of books and I was really uncensored if you will. And you just learned a  lot. All the Alcott books, all the great authors and we played the game     Authors    and so I think all that generated in us that you could see   you  could just see the whole world through the eyes of all the adventures we  went through. All the Nancy Drew, all the Hardy Boys, all the Bobbsey  Twins and The Catcher in the Rye and it was a great way to grow up.  And then you went to college where?  I graduated high school at sixteen, which I don   t believe anyone should  do, and hit the college campus in Oxford, Ohio   Miami of Ohio at  seventeen. I completed two years and didn   t do very well. My kids  constantly would ask,    What were you doing?    And I would say,     Having a good time and growing up.    I protested the Vietnam War  even though my dad was there   Dow Chemical and Napalm. So I guess  you could say I could have been sort of a hippie at the time   bell  bottoms and long hair and I just didn   t like Napalm. And then married  and moved right to military bases and moved six times in the next  6  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  twelve years. And again, an education and meeting different people and  had four children in six years   then came to Oklahoma.  What brought you to Oklahoma?  My husband   my kids    father was in the military and got out after ten  years and we came here with American Airlines. We stayed here ever  since 1978. And I decided it was a great place to raise children and it  was a small state where you could influence policy and see the changes  that you wanted to see, be a part of the changes you wanted to see. So in  spite of the divorce in 1981, my children and I stayed here. The public  schools have served us very well. The community helped me raise a  great family and I now have five grandchildren here in Oklahoma and  I   m very blessed. In the religious community, the business community  and all the friends we   ve made here really have led to us being able to  give back to our community and I think that   s what   s important.  And how early in your life did you become interested in politics?  Wow, that   s hard to say. I mean, I always voted in national elections but  I never really thought republican or democrat. Having been a single  mother for a while, without an education, I probably always   and  having had a heart for the under-served in our community and the  disabled and disenfranchised, I suspect I was always a democrat and  didn   t know it. But when it came time to register, I always   I   ve never  voted straight-ticket. So I would always look at the people and learn as  much as I could.  But, I actually became involved in politics when in 1981 I went to work  for a young woman at the time named Susan Savage. And Susan and I  ran the Crime Commission. It was a non-profit which dealt with crime  prevention and community safety. We chugged along as any non-profit  does, making it month to month, raising money and serving the  community. It gave me the opportunity to visit homes all over Tulsa.  And most of these people were victims of crimes. I volunteered for Call  Rape at the same time and set up a close relationship between the police  and myself and learning how to teach people to protect themselves and  prevent from being victimized again. Sort of teaching them to be Bob  the Builder and have a toolbox of common sense and ideas and things  they could use. So it gave me the opportunity to be in apartment  complexes, economically challenged neighborhoods   dealing with  everyone from prostitutes to the disabled to those who were mentally  disabled to the very wealthy. And that was a great education for me.  When Susan Savage left and went to work for Rodger Randle, who was  then the mayor of the city of Tulsa, I became the director of the  7  Finchum  McDaniel  Commission. She went on to be the mayor of Tulsa. I went to City Hall  and took my toolbox of skills of neighborhood and community  organizing and opened the Office for Neighborhoods under Mayor  Savage. It was a great way to expand what we knew about crime  prevention and in building safe communities, but taking on other things  like crime related conditions in neighborhoods, the broken window  syndrome, facing trash, junk, debris, graffiti and merging that with crime  prevention skills and better roads, streets   it just all merged to help  form community organizations that we could use through City Hall to  help people live in a community they wanted to live in and it could look  the way they wanted it to look. So at that time Susan was mayor, and so  even though she didn   t involve us in a lot of campaigns, I did get  involved in sales tax and bond issues. And so that was pretty much my  first exposure to seeing how you had to raise money for campaigns and  how you had to work with people, listen to their needs, to craft  campaigns, to help them to support what they wanted.  So what led up to your decision to run for office?  Well after Susan Savage served as the first woman mayor of Tulsa for  ten years and when she chose to leave office and go on to other things     she   s now Secretary of State in Oklahoma for Governor Henry. But at  that point, my youngest child graduated from medical school and I  moved the office into Public Works and sort of took on recycling and  more environmental issues   working with citizens cleaning up trash and  debris and that sort of thing. But at that time when my son graduated  from medical school he said,    Mom, you have four kids with post-graduate  degrees. It   s about time for you to get back to school.    So I  enrolled in Tulsa Community College and got my associate   s degree at  night and then to OU  University of Oklahoma  to get my liberal studies  degree, my bachelor   s degree, while I was working at the city.  And just as I graduated, Mary Easley, the woman who represented our  district, went on to be a Senator, was giving up her seat and she came to  me and said,    I think you would be perfect for this. Would you consider  running?    And Jari Askins, Lieutenant Governor now, came and spoke  with me and I saw it as a way to move to a different level to help people.  And I thought about it long and hard because I love local politics, I love  grassroots, being close to the public as possible. But I also have a lot of  people in my district who didn   t have health insurance any longer. That  troubled me. Typically when you went into a home and talked to people,  the first thing they talked about was either crime or the neighbor didn   t  mow their grass or a barking dog or a street light out. More and more  they were saying,    I have cancer and I can   t get insurance. I   ve lost my  job. I   m working on a contract. I can   t support my family.     I have seen more depression. I have seen suicide attempts. No matter  8  Finchum  McDaniel  what neighborhood I went in, when I asked how things were, it was  leading back to economic challenges people were having. And so I  thought at the state there were two things I could help with, education  and I   m on the education committee because I saw Tulsa Public Schools  as an economic driver. It was driving people out of Tulsa in some ways  because the schools had challenges they hadn   t had before of more  economic depressed neighborhoods, more minority challenges for  schools. So I thought perhaps I could affect health care and public  schools by being elected to the state legislature. So, I decided to run.  And did you have a particular campaign strategy? Knock on every  door?  I did knock on every door. I knocked on over 10,000 doors the first year,  and the second election as well. I find that when you knock on a door, it  was a surprise to me because the community had changed even more  than I knew. I would have people come outside, close the door and start  crying. They were grandparents raising grandchildren. Unbeknownst to  me, Oklahoma was the leading state in grandparents raising  grandchildren. We incarcerate many women here in the state. We had a  methamphetamine problem which led to part of that. But overall, we  incarcerate women at a higher rate than most any other state. With that,  we have women who lose their children and next of kin, grandparents  have stepped in to take that role.  In other cases, parents have just disappeared for whatever reason. And  so these are people in their seventies who have not planned to raise  grandchildren. They would step outside and explain they   ve exhausted  their resources. They are seventy-five and trying to teach a sixteen year  old how to drive, which frightens me too, frankly. I learned about that. I  learned about the challenges in having had breast cancer and not being  able to afford your insurance premium any longer. So I realized more  and more companies were offering jobs without benefits. It was an eye-opener  for me and a heart-opener   it was just, the challenges these  people face every day, unable to maintain their homes on their social  security and their retirement.  The need to plan for the future and how a community can step in and  off-set some of these losses through non-profits, which Tulsa is very  generous in the giving community and through the United Way. But it  just helped me to see through the eyes of people, maybe a little different  than myself. I hadn   t realized all the challenges they had, the challenges  of mental illness in our community and not being able to get parity, and  not being able to get health insurance coverage. I found many people  were confusing substance abuse and mental illness, because they  couldn   t see it. Often times, insurance companies, disassociate your head  9  Finchum  McDaniel  from your coverage. If you have cancer, you have coverage but if you  have bipolar disorder, you may not have the same access to healthcare.  And so all that became real to me during the campaign.  The grassroots campaign of knocking on doors, to me, that   s the single  most valuable tool we have when we campaign. I mean, usually when  you knock on doors, people think you are trying to sell them something.  So I decided never to use a phone call. And I don   t use a phone bank. I  always tell people,    Talk to me while I   m at your door because I   m not  going to be calling you.    And I   ve tried to hold to that tradition. And so  it   s a lot of walking, but I   m a marathon runner so walking is actually  enjoyable and it   s healthy and at the same time, you get to hold people   s  hands and listen to them.  What was the election like the first time around?  Well, actually I lost the election   my first election, election night. When  they closed the polls, I had lost twelve out of twenty precincts. And so I  was behind but there were absentee ballots, which I didn   t know about.  And as it turned out, about midnight when the absentee ballots were  opened. I won the election by thirty-five votes out of over 15,000. So the  idea that every vote counts became very real to me. And so I went home  and woke my husband up. He   d gone to bed and I said,    Well it looks as  if we won this election.    I had been out taking down all my signs  (Laughs) because I didn   t know what else to do.  So we started out with a re-count and I learned to really appreciate the  electoral process here in Oklahoma. Every ballot cast was taken to the  courthouse and was opened and counted by hand. And it validated that I  did win the election. When there is a smudge or any doubt, we knock  that vote out, so I ended up winning by twenty-four votes. More and  more I say to people,    Go to the polls. Educate yourself on the issues  and vote.    The second election, I won by a little bit more, six-hundred  and some votes out of 12,000. But I think there is no better system in the  world than the system we have. You live with the results and I don   t take  it personally. If the message I offer people is different than what they  want to represent them. I completely understand that. So I like to think  we have more common than not. But if that ever becomes the case, I  would understand that.  There   s lots of work that can be done and this is just an honor to serve  people. While I think I bring good skills to the table, listening and  representing people in my district, what I like to do is broaden their  knowledge of what we do. So often there   s polarizing issues that they  may cast a vote because of one issue. But if you cast 1500 votes in a  year, in committees and on the house floor, they understand there is so  10  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  much more to it than perhaps just a woman   s choice vote or an  immigration vote. There   s a lot more that comes into play. And so they  need to know how their money is being spent and how their voice is  being heard and how votes are cast on their behalf.  Did you have a slogan?  No, I don   t think I did. As I think back about it, I didn   t. I   ve always  been a neighborhood person and I just wanted to be a good voice at the  capitol and the people   s house. And I could only say   I didn   t go with  preconceived ideas that I would be one way or another. I really felt I  needed to listen to them and I   ve carried that out. I   ve continued to  survey, to knock on doors, to be accessible always. So I didn   t go with  preconceived ideas that I will do this or I will do that. I have been  labeled that I   ve led other people to that. I think there   s too much work  to do to try to wear one hat or another. But instead, look at each issue. If  I had any slogan, it would probably be   I   d fall back on the Rotary Four  Way Test so I   m always asking,    Is it the truth? Is it fair to all  concerned? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?    I sort of fall back on  that and look at it through those lenses when I cast that vote.  Well tell me about the day you were sworn in.  Wow, it was   well first of all, I didn   t know until just a week before  because we had to wait for the re-count. And so, when you step into that  chamber it is such an honor because you know that you   re representing a  part of the state in the people   s house. My grandchildren were there and  my children and I think all of us that are parents, that is our goal   to  always do things that would make our children proud and set a good  example. And try to lead your life in a way that is exemplary and that  they would be proud to say that I was their mother. I always hold myself  as a mother and a wife and grandmother and a friend and a daughter and  a sister and as a representative. I know all my constituents have all those  relationships, too.  When you step in there, it   s just such an honor. It   s very humbling to  represent people and to carry their wishes with you and their troubles  and their successes, their desire for good education in Oklahoma, for  higher education, for good healthcare. You know, we   re making  Oklahoma a great place to raise your families and to grow old and to  work and have a career. And so all that sits on your shoulders. I would  say that my faith has been not renewed, but validated and has grown. My  prayer time has grown a great deal and people know me probably find  that kind of funny because as a runner and a marathoner, I   ve always  said,    Well when you are running you have lots of time to talk to God.     But I must tell you, this job has brought that relationship even closer in  11  Finchum  McDaniel  my spiritual life. I say that because there are times when you know  nothing else to do, but to say,    Dear God, what can we do about this  situation? Help me to understand both sides of this issue and to vote in a  way that it makes the world a better place to live.    And so all that  weighs on you when you walk in the building. Not just in the chamber,  but when you walk up those steps   I just take it very seriously.  What about the first day that you presented a bill?  Well that   s very scary, even for those of us that have done a lot of public  speaking. And that   s what I found to be so strange, was that you are  nervous and when the microphone comes on, even though I   ve done  public speaking for years and never been at a loss for words, people will  tell you, you still find yourself with the gravity of the situation and the  honor and that you   re speaking for many people and that you don   t want  to offend anyone, that you want to be very careful in what you say. And  actually, looking back I wish I had a little more debate. I feel like the  Lincoln-Douglas debate (Laughs) might have helped me a bit because  you   re trying to present your bill in a way that helps those who may  oppose to see what you   re trying to do.  I realize before you get to the House floor, people have already decided  how they are going to vote, in most cases. So often your debate is out  there as sort of a history of your thoughts on this. And to explain your  feelings and the feelings of the constituents that you represent and why  you feel this is important. It   s grown more important because now we   re  on audio so people at home can sit and listen to us. That   s probably been  the hardest thing about debating and being on the house floor because  people sometimes are confused that you voted no on an amendment but  you voted for the bill. So I think debate is very important. It does make  you nervous and I don   t know if it gets easier or not but I   ve found that I  write   I script out pretty much what I   m going to say.  And of course, you can   t always in debate but you just want to be very  careful with what you say and not to insult anyone because partnerships  are critical in the legislature. Whether republican, democrat, urban,  rural   it   s just critical that our partnerships and our trust amongst each  other is very important. Because on any given day and issue that you are  partnered with someone on and you   re working and they   re a very close  friend of yours   the next day you could be debating against them and  very passionate in your belief and hope to defeat them. And that night  you   ll share a cup of coffee. So that was probably the hardest thing for  me because I sort of wanted to like   I wanted to brood a little bit when I  lost issues and there   s no time for that and so I just go back to the  drawing board and you watch faces and you see what words provoke  and emotions that you want and you need to put those in your little  12  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  briefcase and use them often.  I   ve found that being brief and not talking a lot on the floor, people tend  to listen more because they don   t hear your voice all the time. And so  when they hear a new voice, they   ll stop what they   re doing because if  you   ve ever been to the House, there are people walking around all the  time and there are a lot of conversations going on as we are in debate  and passing bills. So I   ve found being brief and succinct and to the point  and not wasting people   s time is very important.  Did you have a mentor or a role model?  I would have to say there have probably been a multitude of them.  Certainly Susan Savage has been a mentor to me and she   s younger than  me but she had the foresight to see in me the potential. I asked her once  why she hired me and she said,    You are a single mom with four kids.  You can get them up, get them out the door, get them to all their  practices and games. And I thought, this is a person I need, because if  you can organize and all that       So, that had an influence on me.  Watching people work, having a good work ethic is so critical. All the  people I come in contact with that I admire, I look at that and think what  I liked about them, what leadership style they had that was effective and  I try to use that. It varies from day to day but I would say Susan was  very great and very articulate. And she kept copious notes of  conversations so she could refer back to them.  I don   t think anything can serve you as well as just doing your  homework and knowing your issues, always telling the truth and when  you make mistakes, which you will, learn from the mistakes and confess  that you made a mistake here but see how we can do it better. Those are  skills I learned in watching her. And always being respectful of the other  person whether you agree with them or not   not to ever humiliate  anyone or humble someone. I think learning that, watching her certainly  working under her for fifteen years, I learned that. And also I would tell  you that in her opinion, family came first. If your family and your own  spirit isn   t filled with what it needs, you   re probably not going to be the  best employee you can be. So always being respectful of people   s family  and they   re going to give you sixty hours a week if you do that, whether  they know it or not they will. So having worked for a great person helps  you.  Did you live in Oklahoma City while you are in session?  I do.  You do.  13  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  I have a garage apartment there and that reminds me of the story of the  Millicent Fenwick who had an apartment when she was in Washington. I  have no television there. I have one radio station, I won   t name it but it  gets me my news. And I have a coffee pot and a refrigerator, no  telephone and it   s sort of my place to go and have solace and I can read  my bills. So yes, I stay there during the week and come home on the  weekends.  Your Walden   s Pond, I suppose.  Oh absolutely, and you know I   ve been to Walden   s Pond because I  lived in Bedford, Massachusetts at one time and absolutely. I   m a person  that people think that I   m extroverted, but on Myers-Briggs I   m a tad bit  introverted. I need time to fill my own well. And I do that through  reading and contemplating and just enjoying the weather, what   s around  me everywhere I go. I   m a runner so I incorporate that into my daily  routine as well.  What is a typical day like for you when you   re in session?  Well, it starts pretty early. Usually between five and five-thirty and I try  to get up, turn the coffee pot on and listen to the news, tie up my shoes  and head out the door. And sort of plan my day on running. I try to go  alone, I might see someone else or wave but I like starting the day in the  dark. I like all kinds of weather   rain, we don   t have snow anymore but  I like it too. I think it gives me a good balance and maybe not every day  but I try every day. I   m not one of these people that if I don   t get it, that  I can   t manipulate during the day. I   m not that addicted but it   s a  contemplative time so I like it. And try to get into the office, depending  on the day when it starts. But I   m a morning person. I like my pot of  coffee. I like to be behind a desk between 7 and 8 depending on what the  schedule is, if there is a breakfast.  At the capitol it   s very hard because we spend a lot of time at meetings  and a lot of the meetings are coordinated around food, which I know is  great coming from a family farmers, food is important. One of the  challenges is trying to be pleasant and polite and not eat everything  that   s put in front of you because we   d just   it wouldn   t be healthy for  us. And using every minute to listen is probably my hardest thing  because I   ve always tried to do other many things at the same time, write  something while I   m listening to something. But I   ve found with so little  time now and reading being so critical to our job, I have to listen to  every word people say because if they hand me something, the chance to  read through it may not be as great as listening to what they say.  And so keeping copious notes on who you talk to, thanking them. I don   t  think anything replaces being polite to people and to sending thank you  14  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  notes, handwriting notes, I probably do at least ten to twenty a day hand-written  notes to people. Anyone that calls me or e-mails me, I try to get  back to. And also thanking people for their time. Meeting with lobbyists  is critical   they bring the perspective of whoever they represent. And  hearing both sides of every issue and doing the research I couldn   t  possibly do it. They   re the ones that have to stay up all night and read  the bill. I rely on them to tell me what   s in the bill and then I can look up  the amendments and listen to the debate. You spend the day on the  phone talking to people from the time we get up to the time we go to bed  at night. So for most of us, if we don   t go to the gym or do something in  the mornings, we don   t get to it after that because there are people  waiting for your time.  Well is there socializing at the end of the day     As freshman there is. During your freshman year, that is pretty much  when meet yourself going and coming and you eat way too much rich  food. You probably don   t get as much sleep. In my second year, I  reserved only so many nights to go out a week   two nights a week. And  I have a granddaughter who is three and a half and so I desperately tried  to see her for just one night a week. Then the second year, your second  session   I also spent more time in the office at night. I suspect this year  I will probably go out maybe one night a week and spend the rest of my  nights in the office. Because you can sit there, and that   s when you write  your letters and you can return phone calls and e-mails. I try to do all  that personally and get back to people and ask what they think. And then  sometimes we just sit in our office at night and call constituents because  you are away from the city and ask them what they think about things.  And   because we don   t know till we get there what bills are going to be  introduced necessarily and what we   re going to here on a daily basis. So  I just have people that I may call that maybe have adopted a child that  has a disability and say,    Are you being served? Are you getting your  phone calls answered? Just how you doing?    That helps connect us back  to our constituency.  How do you pick those people? How do you know who they are?  You generate lists of people and when I ran the first time, one thing I  started when I worked at the City of Tulsa was block parties and so I  understand the importance of neighborhood coffees or block parties.  You develop hundreds of relationships, of someone who may be a child  in my history who was abducted and murdered. So the people in that  area had a very different feeling for awhile, building a memorial in her  honor at a local elementary school, so you meet so many people. A first  grade teacher who has taught children from Mexico for ten years and I  would call and say,    How   s it going?    Well one thing that surprised me  15  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  last year, she said,    Well to be honest with you, things have changed. It  used to be these kids would come in at first grade and within a few  weeks they were teaching their parents English and things were  changing very quickly. Well now our population in Tulsa is such that  Hispanics have their own television stations, radio stations and even  their own newspapers so there   s more reluctance on the part of the  parents to learn English. And so the kids aren   t learning English as  quickly.    Little things like that, I would never have thought about that.  But it   s a fact and so what someone tells you one year may change two  years later. And so you just call folks and teachers. I have 285 school  teachers in my district. I very much want to know how things are  changing.    Did you get the raise that we voted on? How   s No Child Left  Behind? How does it trickle down? What does it mean to you as a  special education teacher?    All those things I need to hear because  they   re in the classroom. I   m not. And even when I visit and shadow, it   s  not the same. So their eyes and ears are valuable to me when I sit at  committee meetings and listen to bills.  So you sit in the office till ten o   clock at night?  Well, usually not that late because I have to go to bed and get back up.  But certainly the longer you serve   I think you spend more time doing  that. Whereas your first session, you really just spend time meeting  everybody and you   re invited to dinner at very nice places. And it   s a  group and a circle of people that you will come to rely on. But now, as I  look at my fourth year, I know those people. I know their phone  numbers, I know their cell phones. They can call me and I call them so I  don   t need to have dinner with them any longer really. I can get them  quickly if I need them.  Well you   re one of nineteen women serving in Oklahoma, can you tell a  difference between how that group reacts or interacts with the men or is  gender no longer an issue?  You know, a lot of people ask me that and I never thought that it was.  But after I got elected I must tell you it came to my attention that  perhaps women weren   t as respected and highly regarded in the world of  politics as I thought that I always was. I guess I just never thought about  gender. I always thought the skills you bring to the table were what were  important. But, I have found that we have a ways to go. So actually I   m  probably kind of more of an advocate for women than I was when I was  elected because I saw that we might be allowed to talk, perhaps what we  said wasn   t considered as high a priority. I just love the opportunity to  share with people my perspective. And we do bring a unique perspective  and I think it needs to be a balance of men and women.  16  Finchum  McDaniel  The world is changing. But perhaps   and I can liken it to this, I was a  woman in the    60s. I remember when only married woman could have  access to birth control. Single women could not have it. I lived when the  pill came into existence. And I   ve seen fathers now, including my son,  and my daughters who   ve had children, realize they   ve looked at their  children before they   ve been born. They looked at them through  ultrasounds. They   ve come to know the child in utero and we didn   t in  my generation. So we look at things differently and I greatly respect  that. It   s given me a chance to understand how important it is for women  to speak out because women today are in the workforce. They   re not  going back to the home. We don   t have access to that. My daughters  have full-time careers and they balance challenges that I didn   t have to  balance when I had little ones at home. But with that change, I think  women do need to pay attention to politics. They need to be educated on  the issues and they need to have a voice.  When I went back to college, I had women sitting in my classroom who  were saying they were going to grow up and meet Prince Charming. And  I don   t think they really thought they were going to be in the work force  until they were seventy, which they will need to be probably because of  the Social Security situation and the life expectancy for all because our  life spans are changing what we do in different decades. And once I was  elected, it became clear to me that there were people that still thought  the woman   s place was in the home, that children shouldn   t be educated  before first grade or kindergarten. They really didn   t realize the  profound need for prenatal care and for early childhood education. So I  think we do need women to share these experiences and to verbalize  them. I think we can do a good job of that. So that   s what I see as sort of  my role now. I love men but I see myself more and more articulating the  challenges of women in a global society.  If a woman was interested in going into politics, what would you have to  tell her?  I would say it   s very rewarding, but it   s all encompassing   every minute  of your day. And you can be a great manager but when the phone rings  at ten at night and someone needs to tell you something that has  happened to them or has someone who   s died in another state and needs  to know how to get them back, or they have a grandchild who has just  been picked up for methamphetamine and how do you bail them out, and  they had your phone number on a magnet on their refrigerator. You   re  going to take that call. And so it   s very important to balance   to  constantly balance your spiritual life, your family, and meeting needs of  your constituents. It takes a lot of energy and it   s very rewarding. But I  think that it   s not something you can capsulize in a 40-hour week and  just say you   re going to do it at certain times. Because to be the best you  17  Finchum  McDaniel  can be, I think you have to be accessible. You can   t say,    Oh well that   s  not my job.    Because they called you, you certainly need to put them in  connections to where they can get help as quickly as possible. So I  would definitely recommend it, but I always tell people with young kids,  it   s a balance. I don   t know if I would want to be away from kids I had  at home and having to live in the city for four months in the year. I   m  married to a saint. My husband of over twenty years now is just a perfect  person. He just balances it all very, very well. He has a career too, but if  I had kids at home I would really think twice about it because you are  away a lot.  And I do take grandkids to meetings with me. Just as I did my own kids,  my own kids have always had a mother who   s at a public meeting some  place. They   ve always done their homework while they sat beside me or  rode in the car or when I was running, they would be on a bicycle and I  could give them spelling words because I   d memorized the words before  we left. So if you can juggle and manage it, it can be the best of both  worlds because you are also going to open it up to young families too.  But it just takes a commitment of your partner, your spouse, and a lot of  balancing and a great sense of humor.  Probably one of the funniest things I did one day, because you   re always  in a hurry and you   re always trying to look nice and I   ve been so jealous  of men because they just jump out of the shower, they just put on their  suit and I don   t know if anyone notices if they wear the same suit  everyday or not. But I think for women, we want to always look  presentable and be clean and look like someone   s mother, sister, wife,  friend. And I was driving to work and I looked in my cosmetic mirror  and my eyes are just pure red. And I said,    Oh my gosh.    You do read a  lot when you are in the legislature so I have a lot of eye drops and six  pairs of eyeglasses. Because you fall asleep reading and you wake up  knowing that you need to reread something to educate you about an  issue. And I looked at my eyes and thought,    Oh my goodness. I   m  going to have to go to the doctor.    Well what I had done, I had used  some lipstick liner for eyeliner because they looked kind of the same and  I was in a hurry. And so it was fine and it turns out I was just fine. But  you have to get little tricks so you don   t make mistakes like that, and  fortunately I wasn   t going to a television interview that morning. You do  learn to look in the mirror before you go out in public but that was a  first. When you are trying to micromanage and you are trying to do  everything, you can get kind of busy at times.  Do you have a bill that you are particularly proud of?  Oh there are lots that I have worked with that I   m proud. I would say  that my passion has become women and children and so any bill that  18  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  we   ve worked on that is getting more kids to have insurance, access to  insurance. Because I truly believe that, and there   s a saying that   s not  original with me but it   s,    Sick people can   t earn and sick children can   t  learn.    And I think that if people are healthy and have access to  healthcare, they are going do better at work and their children can learn  better at school. And so those have been issues, being on the Health  Committee has been very helpful to me and trying to make sure the kids  have access to those needs and then good education.  There are little bills that you bring and we   re a very populous state. We  have a huge constitution. And so, working with people with disabilities,  looking at the list for the advantage program, making sure people are  having access to what they need. Navigation systems for grandparents  raising grandchildren   that we   ll probably look at this year. Also I come  to the table believing that all state employees want to do good and great  jobs, citizens of the state. And if someone   s not served, perhaps it   s just  a communication that we have hooking them into the right channel and  the right system. So I   ve really been fortunate to work with great  department heads and I know that they want to connect with people  where we can serve them the best we can do.  Probably just channeling people together and putting the connections  and networks together to communicate needs and services has been  probably the most important thing. I don   t have a huge need to be an  author of something. Being a part of something and moving it forward  within the group has been important to me. This year I   ll probably  introduce the bill that would prohibit adult smoking in cars with  children. Every time I see a car go by with   I just think,    Ugh     And so  it   s not so much the ownership of a particular bill, it   s issues that you  work on with others and you try to do the best job you can.  Do you find yourself    buddying    up with any of the women in  particular?  Absolutely. Representative Lee Denny and I   Lee   s a Republican     we   ve talked about starting a Common Sense Caucus because a lot of  times you see things and you scratch your head like,    Who thought of  that? What were they thinking?    But you do. And it   s funny, you reach  across the aisle. I   ve probably worked with most of the women on the  other side of the aisle on issues. And on my own side, sometimes we  agree and sometimes we disagree. That   s what   s interesting. It doesn   t  always break down party lines. And we have a Cancer Caucus which I  found to be very interesting.  Mostly men? Or men and women? Or mostly women?  19  McDaniel  It   s women and men actually. But when women come together   it   s  funny, I find myself in meetings, having been a mother March of Dimes,  mother marcher   I find that certain disease groups or specialty groups  will go to men or women sometimes to run. And actually, they   ll go to  the majority party, which I   m in the minority right now. So if you have a  bill you want, you probably need to have an author in the majority party  or one in each party because right now we   re kind of in a unique  position because our Senate is equally divided and the House, it   s just  not republican. So people sponsoring bills, you have to look at that to  see if you can get it here.  I actually carried a bill last year which didn   t get a hearing. It was to  require seatbelts in the backseat. In Oklahoma, you don   t have to wear  seatbelts in the backseat of a vehicle. A child does but adults do not. I  thought that was a great bill, but I didn   t get a hearing. And then there  are things you carry, sales tax exemptions on hearing aids, Habitat for  Humanity   I   ve been a chairman so I   ve carried sales tax exemptions on  materials for Habitat. So you carry all these things and sometimes if you  can   t get a hearing because you are in the minority, a majority member  will take that and carry it for you if they believe in that. So there are just  many things   this is an interesting state. Our tax structure is interesting.  It   s not like any state I   ve ever lived in because we   re so dependent on  sales tax, which is regressive in my mind. But this is a state unlike  Massachusetts that has realized that people here don   t want to pay  property tax. And in other states I   ve lived, property taxes were a much  bigger part of the equation for state funds to meet their need. So it   s very  interesting.  I would say as a state legislator that   s been my biggest challenge is to  learn the funding formulas of all our agencies in the state and then try to  see how we can do a better job of it. And if you look at the history of the  United States   and when I was first elected, I went back and read Angie  Debo   s works and tried to figure out who is Oklahoma? Who is the  Oklahoman? And where did these people come from? And why did they  think the way they think? Because I wanted to know. I thought if I  understood the roots of the state, I could do a better job. So I went  through Leadership Oklahoma, which took me from Fort Sill   being in  the barracks, talking to men about being deployed to Iraq, visiting Death  Row in McAlester   Big Mac   going to Guymon to Seaboard to the hog  factory and watching people work. I thought,    Surely they get carpal  tunnel working these shifts day after day in a hog plant.    Just trying to  learn what makes Oklahoma tick. And that helped me understand better  some of the bias and some of the culture of Oklahoma.  When I came here, we have a culture not necessarily of having the same  desire for education as other places that I   ve lived. A culture of  20  Finchum  McDaniel  education being a path out of poverty and I think that   s changing and I  want to see us keep moving in that direction. And then there   s the  culture of insurance and as of right now, with the presidential election  already underway for 2008, I finally started realizing that a lot of people  in Oklahoma have not valued insurance necessarily, or healthcare. So I  listen to that and talk to people 21 to 35 who think nothing is ever going  to happen to them where they would need health insurance. And  hopefully they are right, but unfortunately they are very prone to need it  at some point. (Laughs) And so understanding that, and then putting it in  terms that people in our state can see how this can move us ahead in a  global economy because more and more, I think, we understand that  we   re not competing with Texas and Kansas   we are competing with  the world. And our children tomorrow will be competing globally and  that   s exciting.  I think taking where we started today and going back to the roots of my  grandparents who gave me security and a feeling of safety and a great  work ethic, how we will plant that in kids today who are examples and  then let them move through. They are going to be navigating in a world  that we can   t even envision at this time. So I think that   s part of our  challenges as legislatures is how do we bring Oklahoma to a level to of  giving these kids the best foundation possible for tomorrow.  Sounds like you need to be re-elected and re-elected.  Well, I would think so but you don   t know. I think when one door  closes, another opens. So that   s really up to voters. I have one thing I  can   t do. I   m not the greatest campaigner. I can   t ask people to say they  will vote for me. I just ask them to consider me when they go to the  polls. I don   t ask people for money. That   s probably the hardest thing.  And I think probably when I was growing up you   re taught not to talk  about yourself, not to talk about your religion, not to talk about money  or politics. And when you start to run, you have to do all those things. I  have to tell you, I don   t like to talk about myself. I try to learn more  about you and store that in my memory so if I see you again I can ask  you something about that grandchild who was born premature, or where  you grew up. But these are things that you have to learn to do.  I would say to anyone running, a woman or a man, they have to be able  to believe enough in themselves if they   re going to ask people to give  them money. And it   s probably harder than asking them to vote for you.  And I believe in using my own money too. I believe in contributing to  my own campaign. How could I ask someone to contribute to me if I  wouldn   t contribute to myself? But I also think that in respecting their  religions and their spiritual life and talking to them about that and just  knowing that we all have to work together.  21  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Do you drive to the capital from Lincoln Boulevard? Or do you come  from a different direction?  No, I do drive down Lincoln Boulevard and it   s awesome. Every time  you go there, you   it   s just a feeling that you   re doing something that  we do in America. We do it in capitals in all fifty states. And there   s  kind of a fraternity of feeling. I don   t play golf, I don   t shoot skeet, I  don   t go on these turkey ventures. And you know, at first I thought,     Well you know, when you   re in politics       But I   ve learned that we  have other common denominators. I think all hundred other legislators I  serve with in the House come with the same good intentions that I do.  It   s just they have different things in their suitcases. Their suitcases are  packed with experiences. So when we get there and we open our  suitcases, then we begin to negotiate on how we reach our goals. But I  think anyone that runs for public office has good intentions to serve  people. I have to believe that every day. And no matter what party they  represent, or what area of the state they represent or how they   re funded,  I think the rules of the Ethics Commission has put forward and the voter  having the ultimate say is the best   it   s just the best system on earth. It   s  not perfect, but it   s the best.  Where   s your office? Being in the minority.  Well, I   m on the third floor. I   m in what   s known as the    bullpen     because it   s very crowded. I have an office   it   s not as big as this room.  But it   s bigger than the   I was in the closet last year. But I like to stay  down there because I stayed with freshmen. I could have moved up to a  bigger office and my assistant   I share my assistant with another  person, which is fine because I try to do as much of my own hands on as  I can and not delegate. But I like being on the third floor. And of course,  when the bells ring I have to run up the steps. And that   s another thing,  guys don   t have to wear heels. I have a red pair of shoes that I   ll be  wearing this year. Sort of a take-off on the Wizard of Oz because I feel  sometimes I am in Oz when I go to the floor. And so I   ll be having a pair  of red heels this year to click together and maybe help me make more  sense of all this. But it   s a great process. It   s such an honor.  I encourage women to think seriously about it and then look to other  women. There are attorneys, there are judges, there are so many women  in positions now and I think that we can take the experiences we have  had, share with each other, have a laugh about it, and then go in there  and try to do the best job we can. I think we   re doing a good job. But as  I said, until I got elected, I really didn   t realize that we were still a  minority in many ways. And we   ve just had the right to vote such a short  time in relationship to the men that have been in control of our world.  22  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  Some have said that it   s not necessarily gender that makes a difference,  it   s where you   re from   Tulsa verses Oklahoma City versus Guymon,  that geography has something to do with it.  That could. One thing being elected to the legislature does, is it gives  you access to people you wouldn   t otherwise get to meet or spend time  with. So we do spend time with people that run colleges, people that are  in huge corporations, people that have been successful worldwide,  people who have gained wealth and success and who often have  different management styles. But you try to glean from them what  worked and what can we take from them and take to the House with us?  And one person I met last year, who I think I will always remember, was  Dr. Jared Diamond who wrote Guns, Germs and Steel. He won a  Pulitzer Prize for that. He was in Chickasha and I had a chance to go and  listen and I took my book to be autographed and I bought his latest book,  Collapse, but he gave a lecture on civilizations and cultures around the  world as an anthropologist. It just brought home to me that even the  differences among the rural and urban legislators, big city, little cities     when you go to New Guinea or when you go to Montana or you look at  Haiti or the Dominican Republic or Africa, we   re all children, we   re all  human. We have the commonality of our own genomes, if you will. And  how we make that work to preserve this planet, it has a profound effect  on me.  So certainly I would tell you that after listening to him and having that  exposure, it even broadens your universe more. So it doesn   t trivialize  what we vote on at all, it makes it more important because you see it as a  much larger picture. It   s sort of a responsibility you go with thus the  growth of the spiritual life because I seek guidance more and more  because I know I   m just one person and I need all the help I can get.  You know, actually you need to spend time with college presidents. It   s  been very interesting. From John Fever down at Chickasha to Gary  Trennepohl who is a runner here at OSU  Oklahoma State University  to  David Boren, George Kaiser, Chief Chad Smith. I mean this state has     I   ve met Wilma Mankiller and I knew Chief Rhodes who just got voted  out. But all these people have unique management styles and skills and  it   s really an education.  It   s kind of like piecing a quilt together isn   t it?  Very much so, very much so. And that   s the kind of safety net we try to  build for the state.  Are you planning on any particular bills this year? Do you already have  23  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  any in mind?  Yes and no. I found that the best success sometimes isn   t all the bills that  you take down there, but all the bills you end up working on with others.  I   ll definitely run a smoking bill, an environment bill probably. I   ll  probably run that seatbelt bill again because AAA and Safe Kids  Coalition have decided it   s important. I listen to my constituents. I talk  to my D.A. I talk to my court system. I   m going to drug court graduation  next week. I was instrumental in a mental health court starting in Tulsa. I  knew we had one in Oklahoma City and we had a great jail diversion  program for mental illness in Tulsa but we didn   t have a mental health  court. And I did an interim study on that and so it didn   t take a bill. The  interim study resulted in the funds being available for Tulsa to use.  Sometimes you have to sort of look at all the things you do and then  look back in a year to see what it   s resulted in. I did an interim study my  first year on mental health court in Tulsa, which ended up happening.  And really, not to plan what was being done but just to offer them  continued care, another tool in their tool box that judges can use and  sheriffs can use. I also did a study on pregnant women   s use of  methamphetamine because visiting the shelter here I realized we were  getting a lot of newborns that were testing positive for drugs. What we  could do about that and how we could do better prenatal care and  screening and educating pregnant women. Because we didn   t want to  lock them up, certainly, because then they wouldn   t have the prenatal  care to have testing done. So that   s a whole social work issue.  Usually groups will come in like social workers or educators and ask  you to carry a bill. Or people in your district will ask you about a bill  that is important to them, and so that   s sort of what we are doing right  now in the interim. And we are allowed to introduce eight bills. I just did  an interim study on housing authorities    jurisdictions and I did an earlier  study this session on adult adopting birth records. In the state of  Oklahoma, if you   re an adult adoptee, you do not have access to original  birth records except to a court order and those are hard to come by. And  so I have a lot of women meet with me who   and men   who are adults  now and they have sought to get access to their original birth record.  And we can   t do that in the state of Oklahoma. So, if it will result in  legislation or not, a bill I   m not sure of right now. Title X is being  rewritten, adoption as part of that bill. So those are just things that you  work with and so I probably will introduce eight bills but I   m not sure  what the content is right now.  So when you say interim study, what all does that entail?  An interim study is usually something that needs more scrutiny. So  24  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  rather than just introduce a bill, you bring together and you have a  concept that you want to discuss and it gives the group a chance to  provide their point of view. In the case of the mental health court, what  we did was we had people from Oklahoma City, the judge and the  D.A.   s office come and make a presentation and people who suffered  from mental illness and how that court had helped them and keep them  from jail. And then the people from Tulsa who had the jail diversion  program came and met at the same time. And you get into a room and  have a discussion. There is no right or wrong. You simply discuss   you  look at what other states are doing and then out of that can come a bill  where you may decide that, just an amendment to a bill or you may  decide that there is no consensus for this to move forward and so you  don   t introduce a bill. It sort of gives you an idea.  Some of the interim studies produce big reports and I have an interim  study right now that I just finished on reactive attachment disorder for  parents with children with RADS  Reactive Airways Dysfunction  Syndrome  and it was an interim study. A plan was developed but the  plan was never implemented. And so often the plans don   t get  implemented unless there   s a resource and funding to put them into  place. So I   m looking at that right now to see if there is access to  services and if these parents have or are they there and they just don   t  know how to get it and we need a better web site or a better support  system. So that   s one thing that you work on in the summer in your  interim time.  Are you the chair of any committees or have you been?  No.  Not yet?  Well no, because I   m in the minority party so I wouldn   t be. The other  party, the majority party, has all the chairmanships. We may have one,  I   m not sure. And then your seniors, your most senior elected officials  are usually chosen to co-chair. But it   s sort of new. It   s a new day in  Oklahoma. I   m in the minority party after 80 years of the democrats  being the majority. I actually came in the year that the democrats lost  majority in the House of Representatives. And so it   s been kind of  interesting, but since I didn   t know it the other way it   s really okay. I  mean, it would be nice because you   d probably get all your bills heard.  But I   ve been very fortunate with the system. I must tell you, I   ve been  treated well by the two republican Speakers that I   ve served under. And  they granted the interim studies I asked for and my bills have, for the  most part, been heard. And so I can   t speak to the other way because I  don   t know.  25  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  What committees are you on?  I   m on the Health Committee, which we now have full committees and  sub-committees and this is a different committee structure too. I   m on  the Full-Health Committee and I   m on Full-Education, which means all  the public school teachers, all the public schools so it   s kind of exciting  because more than half of the Oklahoma state budget of over  7 billion  dollars is allocated to education, Common-Ed and Higher-Ed. So being  on the education committee is an honor and it   s a full-time job. We have  met every Tuesday of the last six weeks studying interim performance  pay and other issues that come up on reform bills.  I   m on Full-Health, we are taking on healthcare. You know,  Massachusetts just went to mandatory healthcare in their state and so we  will be looking at things along those lines. How do you provide  healthcare? Do you take lottery money? Do you take smoking, tobacco  money? Or do you do it with Medicaid? And then I   m on Family and  Children   s Committee and I   m on another committee, Public Health     it   s a little bit different. It   s a variety because some are sub-committees  and some are full-committees but I   m mostly on full-committees.  And that changes from year to year?  From session to session. So I will stay on those committees next year  and then if I   m fortunate enough and re-elected in 2008, then I could  probably stay on the same committees and maybe move up in   you  know, I don   t know if I get to be a vice-chair or not.  Are there a mixture of men and women on most of them?  Yes, they are usually republican majority and democrat minority in the  chemistry of the committees. And that   s the way it is. That   s why when  people say well,    It doesn   t matter whether you   re democrat or  republican.    It really doesn   t until you get into a situation like this  because that is where being the majority is very important. It is critically  important because that sort of decides how the ship is going to go. And  so it   s   and I would say we agree, we being the House, probably on our  votes. It   s 98 percent of the time we all vote together. It   s just on real  divisive issues that we have very clear and distinctive roles.  Does the House have a Mouth of the House?  We do. We do have a Mouth of the House and that is usually someone  who is on the microphone a lot. And maybe someone who   well they  talk a lot.  26  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Who have they been since you   ve been in?  Oh my goodness, Fred Perry. I   m trying to think if we   ve had a woman.  I don   t think we   ve had a woman when I think about it. But it might be a  guy that   it has to be someone that can take a joke. It might be someone  who stood up and screams and yells a lot or someone who has an  opinion on just everything.  Is it normally a freshman or     I was the brunt of a joke which is kind of funny what they do. Every  year they pick a person who they play a trick on and they say that the  Governor   s on the phone and he needs to talk to you. And you go to this  one desk that has a phone and you stand there and I waited thirty  minutes the first year. And you   re voting and everything is going on and  they say,    Representative McDaniel, has the Governor come on yet?     And I say,    No.    And you   re so in awe that the Governor is calling you  and you   re on the House floor and it turns out to be a joke. (Laughs) I  think I probably waited as long as anybody. You   re standing there with  the phone to your ear trying to vote. And of course everyone knows  what   s going on except you, the freshman. But I have a great sense of  humor and I can certainly laugh at myself and so it   s very enjoyable.  Has he called you since?  I have talked to him. Actually, usually he would have an aide call me.  But we do have a close relationship. The Governor vetoed a bill this year  and called the democrats in to stand behind him on that. And it happened  to be on medical anomalies for pregnant women and it was a very  poignant bill and it   s the first time I remember us having all the  OB/GYN   s and nurses and doctors come forward and stand behind us.  We sustained the veto and then it was later a new bill brought back and  we lost that cause. When you work in groups like that you try to reach  out and when you deal with people   s professions that   s when you know  the importance of your constitution and your state.  I certainly never wanted to come between a doctor and patient  relationship or scope of practice. And that   s where we do have doctors  on the floor. We have a doctor who serves with us who has delivered  over 600 babies. He   s a family practitioner. He is a republican, but often  times he stands with the democrats (Laughs) on some issues regarding  medical issues. And so stem cell research, things like that. It   s just very  different, tax cuts is something that I have not been able to support. I   m  a person who believes you get the government you pay for. So I pretty  much support taxes and believe it   s my way of paying for the services  that we desire.  27  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Can you envision any of your children ever going into this career?  No.  No?  (Laughs) Maybe grandchildren. I will say that they have gotten involved  going door to door. My oldest daughter, Theresa, is my campaign  manager. She is a registered republican and she   s an accountant. And  I   ve written a story on everything you ever needed to know you learn  from your children. So having four   and she   s been a teacher to me and  in the business world   she   s a partner in the business now. Her sister is  a social worker with a master   s degree who is probably further left than I  am. I have a son who is a doctor who is right   a little farther right than  Theresa. And then a son who is in California, which I   m not sure what  anyone is in California. But certainly brings perspective of what  Schwarzenegger is doing there now and certainly has cultural challenges  that we think we have in Oklahoma but we have no idea than if you were  in California. From them I learn, I learn and listen and I call them and  ask them what they think. And it   s not if what I   m being told the truth or  not because they know there industries very well. So I have medicine,  accounting, insurance, and then I have social work. So through their  eyes and ears, they   ve helped me a great deal.  They understand the campaign structure. They understand about raising  money. They understand the importance of me being clear in my  messages. They   ve gotten savvy to campaigning and knocking on doors,  and I   m grateful. I couldn   t do it. They are my team and we   re as  grassroots as it gets. My grandchildren can knock on doors too. And so  hopefully what they are learning is how the political process works and  how important it is to be involved. If not in politics, it   s certainly as  community level volunteers. We are serving for and raise money for  causes, scout leaders, Sunday school teachers. And so they know the  importance of giving back.  Do you have a major campaign story?  Well of course the poignant ones are the ones of the grandparents  coming out and talking about the challenges in our society today raising  grandkids. There   s always the funny ones. You know, being invited into  homes, which is something you should never do is go into someone   s  home but probably my family has been guilty of that. You know when  you hear five locks being unlocked for someone to open the door and  invite you in and they   re ninety, my daughter went in and sat down and  people are lonely. And you probably spend more time with people than  you should sometimes. But when something begins moving under a pile  28  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  McDaniel  of laundry on the couch and this guy didn   t have any pets, she exited  quickly. (Laughs) And you certainly want people to be dressed and  we   ve all had people open the doors and found people not clothed as  fully as you would like. And there are always those stories that you  have. But you know they are all God   s children when you knock on their  door.  I guess perhaps I did find a funny story one time. I saw a bumper sticker  on a car in front of a house. It said,    Politicians are like babies, they  need to be changed often.    And so my curiosity just got the best of me  and I knocked on the door, and this man was not a voter on my list. But I  knocked and I said,    Can I just ask where you got that?    And he said,     At the gun show.    And then I noticed he had a gun tucked into his  waistband and he said,    Oh, the gun show.    I saw in the back he had in  his living room a silhouette of a target and it was of a female politician.  And he said,    Oh, you can buy those at the gun show.    I   d never been to  a gun show. And so he had had a bad week. His wife had gone to visit  her mother and he wasn   t sure if she was ever coming back. He lost his  job. And he had done everything right   gone to college, gotten an  education, and he was a victim of downsizing. The company had sent  the jobs overseas. And he had had a pretty bad day and we talked a  while. I later got an e-mail from that man and he was likening the visit  that I had with him to someone throwing a starfish back in the ocean  when a bunch had been washed up on the beach. You pick up one and  throw it back. He said,    You know, you stopping and talking made me  rethink my day. Thank you.    And those are the times that you think,     I   ve got to keep doing this.    You meet people in the community that  want to listen and hear people   s stories and their challenges so we can  try to make life better.  And you   ve been doing just that.  I hope so. And I plan to keep trying to do that.  Is there anything I haven   t asked that you want to make sure we get  down? I   ve gone through most of my list.  No I think that   s fine. Just thank you for asking me.  Well my last question is   when history is written about you, what would  you like for it to say?  I would like it to say I was a good person and I worked as hard as I  could to make life better for our community and my family. And you  know that I was fair and just worked hard. I don   t need a lot of material  possessions in life and so living in my one room when I   m in session is  29  Finchum  McDaniel  Finchum  very easy and not to leave a footprint. I   ve been a backpacker and to be a  responsible person that takes responsibility for my health and for what I  say and do. And to be a good role model for my family and whoever I  come in contact with whether it   s a child that pages for me or someone  that works in my campaign. Just every time you talk to someone, just try  to leave them with a smile and there   s hope. And the problems we face  today, people faced twenty years ago or a hundred years ago, just in  different packages. And so making life better for tomorrow and  preserving the planet is something I hope people will think I took  seriously.  Well I can see why they would after talking to you.  Oh well thank you.  Thank you so much for sharing your story.  --- -------
