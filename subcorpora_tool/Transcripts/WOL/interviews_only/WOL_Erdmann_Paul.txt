Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Today is March 23, 2009. I am in Muskogee, Oklahoma talking with  Paul Erdmann who is the son of Mona Jean Russell Erdmann. Mona  Jean was elected to the House of Representatives in 1944, re-elected in     46 and served through    48.  Lost a state senate race in    48. I   m the consolation prize on a lost state  senate seat. Mom always talked about there being a power group that she  didn   t please coming through. She told them that if they ran anybody  against her, she was going to run for the Senate and take their senate  seat. Well in the last couple of hours of the last day, they sent a guy  down to file but Mom had a friend in the department where they had to  file, so she called my mom. My mom went down, struck her registration  for the House and moved to the Senate, and she was always very proud  of the fact that it cost them  3,000 or  7,000   I never can remember  which now   1948 dollars for them to beat her in the Senate race. They  had to spend very heavily to beat her, and she thought that she had  injured them in their pocketbook. Just a few years back I found out that  she was not aware that my father was not going to marry a state Senator.  If she had won the race, she was going to lose my dad.  Interesting.  They were courting at that point and so      But if she had been re-elected to the House?  He was going to walk.  He   d walk?  Yes. She had to lose. I mean this is 1948. My father had a high school  education, was going to TU (University of Tulsa) on the GI Bill. My  5  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  mother was a lawyer and a Representative to the House. The disparity  would have made it look as though he was the kind of man whose  woman told him what to do and where to go and pushed him around, and  that was just not acceptable in those days unless you actually were, and  my father was far from that. When I mentioned that, my mother was  startled and denied it, you know. I didn   t know what I was talking about.  But my dad and I had had a rather lengthy conversation about it while he  was dying, so that   s when I got to know a lot of things. Actually it was  while he was sick and didn   t know he was dying yet. But yes, I   m the  consolation prize. (Laughs)  She was born in Wilburton, Oklahoma.  Yes.  Did she have brothers and sisters?  She had one brother who was 13 years older than she. He was a judge in  Ottawa County District Court for many, many, many years. He was a  considerable influence on my mother, in interesting ways and that was it.  She had one cousin her age who, in the depth of the Depression that  branch of the family lived in Chicago and couldn   t find work, and  moved in with them for four years, I believe. She went through high  school with my mom and they were very much like sisters, so that was  the other close family member she had.  Had she always been interested in politics when she decided to run the  first time?  Not really. When she came out of law school, she set up a little practice,  but she also, due to a sense of public spiritedness, accepted the job of the  city attorney for the City of Picher which paid a pittance, and that   s what  got her feet wet in the arena of politics. She always talked to me about  this political machine and how she didn   t like them and she didn   t vote  the way they wanted her to. Her father was greatly loved and respected  by the people of the town. He died when my mom was 17, but he had  very high prestige in town.  When my mom decided to run she didn   t have any trouble really  securing the seat based on her. She   d been a straight-A student through  high school and valedictorian. She made her only B in college in  physical education and I don   t think she got a Phi Beta Kappa key. Then  in law school she didn   t do as well but she was the third or fourth  woman to graduate from the OU law school. They didn   t want them;  they didn   t graduate them. So her academic abilities were required for  her to get the law degree from OU.  6  She talked about this power group for years and years and then I read  this article about the resurgence of the KKK in the tri-state area in the  late    40s and suddenly it snapped together for me. My mother, the well-to-  do, well-educated, very white daughter of a much loved man in  town   he was a 47th degree Mason in Knights Templar and 46th in  Scottish Rite. He did the Knights Templar and then his grandfather   s  sword came down to him, but his grandfather had been Scottish Rite, a  mason of the Scottish Rite. His grandfather had been Scottish Rite, so he  read his way through Scottish Rite to the 46th degree just so he could  wear his grandfather   s sword. Back then that was one of the backbones  of the town in terms of social contacts for men, and every summer he  had this huge party with beer and watermelon and everything for the  whole town, and so everybody was invited. He owned the ice plant  which was now like owning OG E, you know, because everybody had  to have ice. There was no refrigeration in the homes, so everybody had  to have an icebox, truly an icebox.  So my grandfather   s employees came in three times a week and put this  big chunk of ice in your icebox   how big depending on how big an  icebox you had   and they talked to the people and he was very good to  his employees. As a matter of fact, he started out the son of relatively  poor immigrants, and by the time he was in his forties he owned seven  ice houses. So seven towns up in the mining district, he owned the ice  plants for and, like I say, treated his employees well. So the name was  incredibly well known and my grandfather, as I said, had been very  much respected so when Mom, who everybody knew had been  valedictorian   little bitty town, everybody knows that kind of stuff     when she ran for office, just name recognition alone   Russell Ice had  been what came in the door every day for a long time.  My mother would have been an heiress, a major heiress, but my  grandfather sold the seven plants. He had heart trouble and he was going  to take it easy. He was diagnosed with heart trouble in his very early  forties and I guess it was in his early fifties that he died. He was  diagnosed in his early 40s with heart trouble. So he was going to take it  easy and they signed the papers on a Thursday night and when he went  to pick the money up from Escrow Friday, the bank had closed and there  was no money. He had lost all of the things he   d worked for his whole  life. Well the people who bought them from him thought that that wasn   t  a fair deal and so they took him on as manager of two of the ice plants.  By the time he died he owned those two again. But yes, Mom would  have been a rich heiress and I certainly wouldn   t have been who I am.  (Laughs)  I got way off of the story. You asked me about had she always been  interested in politics. I believe that she got into politics to counter the  7  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  people who were controlling the politics of the area, and that was the  KKK. So my little petite mom was staring down the Ku Klux Klan. She  never said a word about that for years and years, and then when I  confronted her about it after I read this article, she said,    Didn   t you  know that?    She started having little strokes and forgot things, and she   d  forgotten that she wasn   t telling me. She   d say,    Haven   t you known that  for a long time? I told you that a long time ago, didn   t I?       No, as a  matter of fact you didn   t.    So I think that   s the reason she ran was  due  to  a very strong belief that her father had pounded into her that all  people were of value and nobody was to be thrown away. Now on the  other hand, she very much had the racist thoughts about the culture and  the choice of wallpaper and the choice of perfumes and things like this.  That was kind of funny, but she apparently got into politics to counter  the Ku Klux Klan. They had a hard time going after her because she was  the very individual that they were supposed to be protecting.  So when she ran, she would have been in her mid-twenties? I   m trying to  think. If she graduated from law school, she would have been      Well, she graduated from high school a year early so she went to college  when she was 17. She was 21 when she officially graduated from  college. At that time, your fourth year of college was essentially a first  year of law school and then you did two more years so she would have  been 24. Then she was the   well, she was born in 1917 so we can figure  it out easy enough.  Right.  If she started in    42, then she was 27 years old. She was in her early  thirties when I was born.  Did she talk any about her campaigning?  Some. Not a lot, but a little. She did the normal things   put up placards  and things. The employees and ex-employees of the ice plant put up a lot  of her placards and did a lot of that kind of stuff and it wasn   t,    Put it up  or lose your job,    it was their choice. So they did a lot to support her,  and then people she went to high school with and all sorts of people. My  grandfather, like I say, was a self-made man and he had great respect for  the working man and he imbued that into my mom, so she had support  from a lot of the miners and the people that worked at the ice plant and  then grandfather   s Shriner buddies and grandfather   s other buddies. The  businessmen in town knew each other and there was even a little section  of town where they had their homes. I think the one my uncle, who was  a doctor, built is still there in Picher. I   m thinking that it was a  mansion   they weren   t really mansions, you know. There were  8  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  mansions built at the time. They weren   t ostentatious, but they were big  houses for the time and big houses for an area full of immigrants and  miners who didn   t bring home a whole lot of money. So a shotgun house  was the standard.  My great-aunt and her husband lived in a shotgun house, modified     they moved the back door (Laughs)   right across the street from the ice  plant. My mother lived above the ice plant. They had an apartment, a lot  of square feet because their home had the same square footage as the ice  plant. Well actually it didn   t initially, but when my mother was born her  dad built a bedroom for her that covered the whole dock area of the ice  plant. There was this huge room, knotty pine and windows all over the  place. I remember the ice plant, and that was the room that my  grandfather built for my mother when she was born. So she was a late  surprise and he just doted on her and she worked very hard to live up to  his opinion. Even when he was long dead, she always tried to do the  right thing.  Well how did she choose law?  Her brother was a lawyer. He went to law school. My mother lived  outside of Picher for one year. She lived in Norman for one year. My  uncle got himself kicked out of Kemper Military Academy and  someplace else so they enrolled him at OU. My grandmother and my  mother moved down to Norman and my uncle had to live with them and  they kept him on the straight and narrow, but he lived the life and  behaved the life of the rich man   s son. He had nice cars and there were  some attractive women who were not suitable for marriage   stories  along that line. Nothing like that about my mother, not a bit.  Did she live in Oklahoma City when she was serving?  Yes. She took an apartment in the Skirvin, a hotel that at that time was  one of the very nicest in town. She took a three-room apartment there  during the legislative session.  She actually stayed there?  Yes. She lived there.  That   s a very nice place. In its day it was really nice, they say.  Yes. Once again, she missed being truly rich by 24 hours. Real mansion  rich   but was very well-to-do. So yes, she stayed at the Skirvin when  she was down there. Interestingly enough, her stories about the time  while she was down there didn   t have a lot to do with politics, although  9  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  she wrote a resolution to put women   s toilets on the same floor as the  floor of the legislature. There weren   t any women   s toilets on that floor  because the women would be in the offices which were upstairs and a  few downstairs, but there were no legislative offices on that floor at that  time. So there was no need for women   s toilets on that level  (Laughs)  So she actually wrote a resolution to have a women   s bathroom placed,  and they did, as a matter of fact.  While she served or later?  While she served, I think during her second term. That was one of the  stories she told me. Another was that being female, she carried a certain  power over all these guys. A bunch of the legislators had gone down to  Krebs, not too far from Oklahoma City that has two fabulous Italian  restaurants. I got the impression there were roughly a dozen of them, and  I can   t remember the name of the restaurant, but two of them got to  talking politics, which they weren   t supposed to do while they were  eating, and it became a very heated discussion. One of them pulled a  knife and the other one pulled a gun, and my mom stood up between  them and told them there wasn   t going to be any such behavior as that  by two legislators in the restaurant. Oklahoma was dry, but both the  restaurants in Krebs, one of their draws was that both of the restaurateurs  put up their own wine. So there was plenty of Italian red wine to go with  dinner, so that was part of how a political argument escalated to that  point, but she just stood up between them and said,    Put those away.     (Laughs) Although my mother was not a large person, she had a  presence and people did what she said, most of the time. She had the  voice of command.  Was she the first woman to win from Ottawa County?  I believe she was. She was the ninth  in Oklahoma .  She served with Grace Mitchelson.  Right. There were just the two of them. Actually that   s not true because I  think there was at least one woman that served out a small part of her  husband   s term when he dropped, but I may be wrong about that. My  mother was somewhat disparaging of the women who got in that way  (Laughs) and I don   t know if you   re studying all of the women or just  the ones who were elected.  We   ll have to check and see. We had 77. I thought they all were elected.  Yes, you   ll have to check and see. She was a democrat, of course,  because being anything but a democrat in Oklahoma at that time was  political suicide. The democratic primary determined the winner of the  10  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  seat. You had to really politic for the democratic primary, but then you  put out a couple of signs for the general election if they even had a  republican who   d stand against you, and I don   t know if they did have  one who   d stand against Mom.  Did Grace live with her at the hotel or did she live somewhere different?  No, they lived some place different.  Did they stay in touch after they got out?  No, they did not. Mom stayed in touch with a couple of the women who  were in law school with her, but she didn   t stay in touch with the gal  who was in the legislature with her.  I can   t find her, so I was just curious.  Yes. My Aunt Vivian was one of the women that went to law school  with Mom and became her roommate during the last two years. My  mom, as I told you, was valedictorian, straight A   s   it came relatively  easy to her and so she had an active social life and she went to the  dances and went out on dates and, you know, the proper things of the  time. So the lady who was my quote    Aunt Vivian    was a gal who it  didn   t come tremendously easy to, and she was a bit of a grind, you  know, studying all the time, and my mother took it upon herself to teach  my Aunt Vivian that there were other things in life besides studying the  law books, etc. She must have done a good job because my Aunt Vivian  was quite the character. (Laughs) Didn   t marry till very late in life and  then married a unique fellow.  Did your mother have any interest in going back into politics later in  life?  No. My mother left politics to become a housewife, and that was it. It  was    this is the next chapter in my life      boom.  And quit law as well?  Pretty much, yes. Dad wouldn   t have his wife supporting him. He had to  support the family. Mother had an inheritance   not large, but she had an  inheritance   and Dad made her put it in investments and not touch it.  He earned the money. I remember we did not live in palatial digs  (Laughs) when I was very young. The first house I can remember, which  was the first house they bought, was very small and then the next one  was medium sized. One of my dad   s nephews lived with us for a year  while he was going to TU; it was a two-bedroom house. My sister and I  11  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  shared a bedroom, my mom and dad had a bedroom, and the formal  living room grew a bed and became my cousin Dan   s living area for the  year. I remember that.  So she pretty much stayed in this area, Northeast Oklahoma?  Yes. We lived in Tulsa except for three years, and then she went to  Houston, but my fifth and sixth grade, the last two years of grade school,  which was    60 and    61, we lived in New York. My dad was transferred,  he worked for an oil company. They closed down the separate oil office  and took it into the big corporate offices and then they put it back out.  So two years I lived on Long Island. Then my senior year in high school,  Lyndon Johnson passed a bill that really stuck it to the oil companies  and so my dad   s company sold all its holdings in the United States. They  were just terrible investments at this point and packed up and moved the  whole oil division to Calgary, Canada, another oil town. Calgary   s as  much the oil center of Canada as Tulsa was to the United States at that  time. But anyway, those are the only times we moved away. Like I say,  my mother lived the one year in her childhood in Norman and that was  to get her brother by.  The Edmondsons, one of them became the governor,  J. Howard   Edmondson, he was the younger brother. The older brother  Ed  Edmondson  had been a bit of a mentor and a great friend to my mother  while she was in the legislature. So I remember when I was about six  going to this big J. Howard Edmondson rally   the only time I ever went  to a big political rally. My mom went there in support and to help pull  some support out of Ottawa County. She was just seven years out of the  trenches by then, and the family was still well-known and remembered.  As a matter of fact, there used to be a Tri-State Herald paper up there, I  think it   s finally gone, but several years ago I went up to get some  information. I was being blown off and I said,    I   m Mona Jean Russell   s  son.       Oh, Mona Jean   s son, why didn   t you say that? Your mother was  a fine  woman ,    on and on.  By the way, that was not her legal name and if any of the people she ran  against had known that, they could have voided her.  What was her legal name?  Her name was Ramona Regina Russell. (Laughs) So, let   s see.  It says Office Number 2 so they didn   t have districts back then, I don   t  guess. It   s down at the bottom of that first page.  Well, I think she was the second representative from that district.  12  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Okay, that would make sense.     Graduate of Picher School; city attorney at Picher for the past 2-1/2  years; president of the Picher Board of Education at the present time;  resident of Ottawa County for 25 years; a qualified, conscientious,  efficient resident of Ottawa County    (in big letters)    who, if nominated  and elected, will devote her time and efforts to the best interests of her  constituents.     I think the KKK moved a guy from Missouri or Kansas over early  enough so he could file and so the guy she was running against was  legally a resident, but had not lived there for long. These are from The  Quapaw Chieftain.  Oh, that   s right. Grace Mitchelson, the other lady you   re looking for,  was elected from Ottawa County, too. They were both elected from  Ottawa County.  It was the first time two women had been elected from the same county.  Yes. I don   t know a thing about Grace Mitchelson. Mom never said a  thing about her or anything.     Women Win By Big Margins   Light interest was taken in the primary  election, very light weight was cast over the county Tuesday due to the  lack of interest despite the fact that both parties had almost a full ticket  in the county, and with congressional and senatorial races to stir up state  interest, unofficial returns showed that the two women candidates, Mrs.  Grace Mitchelson of Commerce and Miss Mona Jean Russell of Picher,  were leading their opponent easily in their races on the democratic ticket  for positions one and two as representatives of the state.     So there were two from the county and Mom was running for the second  position.    Mona Jean Russell was far out in front of Charles  A.   Douthat, 1,542 to 655.     Double.  More than double. Double would have been about 1,300 for him   1,310  to be exact   and she was 1,542. So she more than doubled.    Friends and  patrons at public schools.    Yes. Not patrons at private schools; my mom  was a rich girl but she went to the public schools, kind of like the  decision I made with my sons.    Unofficial returns.    There were polling  places where it looks like the whole turnout was something on the order  of 35 people. (Laughs)  13  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Anything about a campaign slogan?     I take this opportunity of thanking the voters of Ottawa County for their  splendid support and their vote of confidence last Tuesday. It is my  earnest desire to merit the faith of the tri-state citizenry      again, tri-state        in my ability to make them a good state representative. If  elected, I will make every effort to give them full representation.        Glamour may come back to the legislature.     title of another newspaper  article  Mom also was a fairly attractive young lady      She sure was.      and she dressed well and so that was the glamour bit. Congressman  Kerr of the  McClellan- Kerr Waterway, you know, he was a role model  for my mom and was somebody that she really looked up to in terms of  the politics of the area and somebody that she was very proud of  knowing. I don   t know if he was Governor while she was in the House,  but she was very proud of knowing him and then knowing him when he  went to Washington as the little giant.     Qualified for service, fairly qualified by a wealth of experience in the  legal profession and private business enterprise,    (the family business)     and municipal affairs and in school administration. This county would  be ably represented in the state legislature by Mona Jean Russell.     That may have been her slogan then,    qualified for service.     May have been. Well,    Put the tri-state on the Capitol beam. Cast your  vote for Mona Jean.     There you go.  That   s it, or one of them anyway. There was a flight training school in  Miami  Oklahoma  and there were Brits brought over and got their  primary flight training in Miami. There   s still one of the old hangers left  up there and the strip was through what   s now a residential area in town,  the landing field, you know, the landing strip. But the people of the area  took in the boys who came over   they were 19-year-old kids, away  from home and such   and they would invite them for Sunday dinner  and things like that. My mother developed great affection for one of  them   probably would have been my father if he   d survived. He didn   t.     Repealed the textbook law.    The textbook contracts were patronage,  but she wanted it to be on the basis of the quality of the books and a  secured, certified audit of the school land department. This is just the  guy who ran against her, but he was attacking her school experience by  14  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  saying,    textbook laws and audit of school land      like she misused  some school land or something      and reduce gasoline taxes and  eliminate 2  use tax on equipment used by Oklahoma laborers.    You  know, she was the rich girl. But you saw the numbers. (Laughs) It didn   t  work at all.  Do you know if she made the scrapbook or if someone made it for her?  Mom made it.  She kept up with it?  Well, no wait. At first it was made for her. I think Aunt Vivian made it  for her. Mother   s other roommate  Alma Bell Wilson  was the woman  on the state Supreme Court for so many years  beginning on February  17, 1982  who died in the last 10 years or so  1999 , but yes, that was  Mom   s other roommate. Like I said, she was really proud of working  with Kerr.  Did she ever talk about the day when she was actually sworn into the  House?  No. She talked about swearing. (Laughs) When the debate got heated,  the language would degenerate and Mother would take her female  presence. Oh, I started to tell you a story and I didn   t finish about me  getting in trouble   the Virgin Street sign. My friend who   s now a  lawyer wanted us to get  a sign  that was about three feet by seven feet  that was by the off-ramp from the expressway there, and so we dropped  him off to get it and figured he   d figure out in awhile that he couldn   t do  that. When we came back around, he was on top of the sign and the sign  was still up, and then the second time we came around the sign was  down, and we called for him and nobody answered. We were afraid he   d  killed his fool self undoing the bolts that held the sign up while he was  on top of the sign. But no, he jumps in, so just as we   re putting the sign  in the trunk, a police officer drives by the end of the off-ramp. Well he  had to think about what he   d seen, so we got in the car and we got done  turning and made a turn in the other direction.  When I had my wisdom teeth pulled I was in the hospital with a car  thief   he was a little older than I was   I think he was residing in a jail  at that time. He said,    If the cops are ever after you turn into a residential  area, pull in the driveway, turn off the lights and chances are they   ll  drive right by you.    I remembered this and so we turned in and turned  off the lights like that, but then the officer came back and we all jumped  out of the car and ran and wound up under a pick-up truck up on blocks  in the backyard of the house where we parked the car originally. You  15  Finchum  Erdmann  know, the thing was seven feet long. It stuck out of the trunk, and you  know that courtesy light in the trunk that lights up to make it easy to get  stuff out in the dark that never works, that breaks the day you get the  car? Worked perfectly; we had an illuminated Virgin Street sign in the  back of our car.  So anyway, we got caught and we went up and talked to the officer and  he said we were probably going to have to pay to have the sign put back  up and we agreed that that was only fair and such, but then his boss  shows up and he looked like he used to be a wrestler and he kept his  head shaved, mean character. This officer looked just like the Great  Bolo. He looked at three long-haired college kids and whispered some  things and then got in his car and left, and my friend who   s now a  lawyer waited awhile and then he walks over to the officer and says,     What are we waiting for?    He says,    Well for another cruiser.    He said,     Why are we waiting for another cruiser?       Well you can only put two  felony suspects in a cruiser at a time.    He goes,    Felony?    and he says,     Yes, you   re being charged with special federal grand larceny.    It was a  law they   d passed when the hippie party   I can   t remember the name     anyway they said they   d shut down Washington, D.C. by stealing all the  signs and people wouldn   t be able to find where they were going, and  they passed a special law about stealing signs off of an interstate  highway and it was two years minimum sentence in a federal prison.  So anyway, the judge that this was presented to started laughing and  couldn   t stop. He was just laughing, and he couldn   t stop. When the  bailiff came down to get us and take us up, he asked us what we had  done, and we kind of wondered why he   d ask that. So we explained that  we   d stolen a Virgin Street sign and been charged with special federal  grand larceny, and he kind of smiles and looks down. The judge had  been laughing, and my mother had told the judge that he could not see us  and sentence us until he could keep a straight face, and he waited until  he could keep a straight face before he had us brought up. (Laughs) She  just had that kind of presence, and I mean this is after she   d been a  housewife for 23 years, you know. She just always had that presence.  People who met her when we came here,    That   s a fine lady.    People  met her and she just exuded the presence. To give you some idea of how  proud Mom was of knowing Robert Kerr, part of her scrapbook is an  invitation from Kerr to go to a movie.  To see Wilson   I   ve not heard of that one   at the Tower Theater. And  she kept it.  Yes, she was very, very proud of having a political relationship and a  friendship with Robert S. Kerr.    Honoring members of the OE Home Ec  Club, the Dramatic Art and Literature Departments of Sorosis Club will  16  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  entertain a program and tea Monday.    I have no idea what this is about.  You   ll have great fun trying to figure out what that   s about; it   s people  who showed up at some    Dramatic Arts and Literature Departments of  Sorosis Club honoring the Oklahoma Club and the wives of state  legislators.    Maybe the Sorosis Club had something to do with being  family of legislators.    Present Cleo Dawson  author of She Came to the  Valley , on Monday the 29th.    So if my mother had a political mentor  and somebody she wanted to behave like   not just be taught by, but  behave like   it was Kerr.  Did she ever take you down and show you where her office was?  Yes, as a matter of fact, we went down   and this was while there were  still a couple of the legislators  at the Capitol  that had been in with  Mother. This was before we went to New York so I was eight or ten. So  she   d been out of the legislature ten or twelve years, something like that.  But a couple of the ones there she still knew and they took a short recess  or something to discuss a bill that was before them and she went down  and caught a couple of the guys, so my sister and I got placed on the roll  as honored guests. Actually I guess it was my mother and my sister and I  that got placed on the roll as honored guests. She showed us where her  office had been, showed us where her pictures were there. I wouldn   t  have known if she hadn   t shown me when I was a kid, where the  pictures were there.  Do you remember which floor her office was on?  The legislative floor is on the second floor, right?  I think so.  She was on three, I   m pretty sure. It was a little bitty office, yes, the first  and second term. You start getting the good offices when you   re fourth  term. (Laughs) The thing about the textbooks      Balloting ends three  days of bitter debate over alleged graft in the adoption of textbooks.   Johnson D.  Hill silent on future plans.       The Oklahoma House of  Representatives today rejected six articles of impeachment against A. L.  Crable, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, by a hairbreadth  margin of 55 to 59 on the count.     Close.  So he was guilty, but had enough support. (Laughs)    House in furor as  Hill resigns and Crable fight.    Hill was the Speaker, but he was from up  around where Mom was from.    Hill versus Crable race rumored for  1946.     17  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Mom sat on the education committee, you know. It was her great area of  interest, and it was not a high-power  position ; it wasn   t Ways and  Means or Appropriations or anything like that. So they tossed her a bone  and let her be on that. She wanted to be.  Well did they have an Aviation committee? Since the flight training was  in Miami, she might have been on that, too?  I don   t think they did. Mom did train as a pilot and she had a pilot   s  license. She decided that her depth perception wasn   t good enough, and  she finished flight training and didn   t solo, and her instructor kind of  agreed with the idea.  Here   s    Girl About Town,    a thing about Mom living at the Skirvin  Hotel. Oh, yes, that   s what it was. The guy with the bandage on his  head   they threw an ashtray in one of these heated debates and it hit  him in the head, cold-conked him. (Laughs) Here   s the thing about it.  Mom presented the bill to permit women to serve on juries in Oklahoma.     This bill has been before the legislature several times before and has  received very little support and Mona Jean presented it at this session,  the bill carried by a very nice majority in the House and is now in  committee in the Senate. We wish to thank Mona Jean for her interest  and congratulate her upon the results of her efforts.    I guess that   s from  The Citator.  According to this, she was thinking about buying her own airplane, a  Taylor Craft Coupe.    Plays a wicked game of bridge.     Yes. Mom played bridge down to the year before she died. She had  multiple strokes, and the stroke that left her unable to play bridge just  devastated her. There were holes in her abilities that you could drive a  truck through, but she could still play bridge. But then it bagged the area  of memory that let her keep track of the cards and so that killed her  bridge club. One of my mother   s earlier times when Mother got to be  proud of me before I became a doctor was when she had me sit in at her  bridge club. They lacked a fourth, and I played bridge, too, and I bid and  made a little slam and all the room just thought I was a great bridge  player. They would make little slams, but they wouldn   t bid it. I don   t  know if you play bridge.  No, I don   t. That   s a very good picture of her.  Yes. It   s amazing how much my sister looked like her at the same age.  She had a number of stories about stopping fights between the guys  because she was female and she had the presence and she could stop it.  18  Finchum  Erdmann  The articles are just a couple of things I have up here about    flying  ashtray knocks out.    Things about the war, that picture   the newspaper  that that picture was part of   tax increases, committees. Mom   s  committee assignments:    Chairman of Correction of Journal       people  made sure that the book was right.    Vice Chairman Mines and  Mining      she was from a mining district so that was moderately  important.    Member Appropriations, Employment engrossed in enrolled  bills, Labor and Arbitration, Lakes and Waterways, Public Health and  Sanitation, State Parks and Forestry, Ways and Means      that was  second term she got on Ways and Means. Kerr got her on Ways and  Means. All kinds of    Rhymes of a Knot Hole,       The Women of the  House      somebody wrote a poem about the women of the House.     We   ve been here now for many weeks,  some good work we have done;  On some bills we were serious,  on others we have fun.  Though noisy as a young cyclone  or quiet as a mouse,  we ne   er had done a thing  without the Women of the House        and the angel. (Laughs) It goes on. I   ll make sure you get a copy of  that, too. And a thing here about Kerr planning three hospitals        Expansion at University Hospital      and a picture of Mom in a mink  coat, yes. She had that   it may still be hanging in that closet. We had  the fur coats. She had some beautiful jewelry, too.  My mother was generous, and that showed up in a number of ways. She  stayed in touch with family and, like I said, we put up my dad   s nephew  when he was at TU. My dad wouldn   t let her spend any of the money,  but my mother pointed out to him that real estate was generally a good  investment, and he had to agree to that so he let her buy a house in  Miami for my grandmother and grandfather Erdmann to move into out  of the bakery in Quapaw and into a nice little house in Miami. I did not  know that until years after my grandparents were dead. I did not know  that we owned the house that I went to visit my  grandparents in . These  were in her school things. I believe that   s her right there.  She   s tiny.  Yes. She was not a large woman. It was just a matter, as I said, of her  having a presence. She had the voice of command. When she said,     Stop,    everybody stopped, and she didn   t even have to raise her voice  unless things were loud.    Stop that.    Boom   people would stop. I have  19  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  it a little bit, but not to the extent my mother did. That   s my grandfather  Russell.  He   s looks very distinguished.  Yes. He had that look. (Laughs) School pictures, high school pictures,  mementos of friendship, with her friends, freshmen, her classmates   all  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Mabel  Phillips attended my mother   s 90th birthday party in Miami, Oklahoma.  Mabel graduated with my mother but my mother started a year early. So  Mabel was actually 91 but they graduated together. Birthdays with my  friends, sophomore and the class roster, Mabel Phillips.  Probably another name now   she married someone else?  Yes. Maxine   was Maxine not in her class? I guess Maxine was a year  younger or older. Maxine was the individual who was president     President Maxine Curley. Curley was my maternal grandmother   s  maiden name and so Maxine Curley was the cousin that came to live  with them, and she apparently was the class president of the sophomore  class. She didn   t sign the book with the rest of the classmates because  she was like a sister. (Laughs) Let me see if there   s anything back here  in that area getting toward junior; senior; baccalaureate; napkin from  Picher high school commencement exercises, high school auditorium,  Picher, Oklahoma   high school   s still there.    The Wanderer,    a  trombone solo. I don   t know if you are familiar with that song. Well it  looks like that is all her political career. This is all school. Mom was in  the Dramatic Club   now I did not know that. (Laughs) Maybe that   s  where she developed part of her voice.  Could be.  So I will copy all this and e-mail it to you. Is there anything further  you   d like to ask me or get on tape? I   ve been telling you a lot about      No, we   ve covered quite a bit.  The Edmondsons and Robert Kerr were her good friends.  J. Howard   Edmondson ran for governor  and served from 1959 to 1963    his older  brother was a great friend and political ally of my mother while she was  in the legislature and then Kerr was her mentor. What she shot at  knowing she couldn   t achieve, but she just recognized him for what he  was while they were both in the legislature. I think most of the people in  the legislature did, too.  If she hadn   t gotten married, she might have gone for the U.S. Congress,  20  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  Finchum  Erdmann  who knows?  I think it quite possible, but my mother believed that the role of a woman  was to be a mother and that you couldn   t be a mother and be something  else other than a basic housewife at the same time, although she did  draw pay from the ice plant for keeping the books when I was young.  Her mom had her keep the books, and she got paid for that. So I spent  every other weekend in Picher, Oklahoma   first it was in Picher and  then it was in Miami when my grandmother fell and broke her hip going  up to my mother   s bedroom from what had been her brother   s bedroom  but was a hall now   there was a very steep set of stairs and my  grandmother was starting to get elderly and she fell down the stairs and  broke her hip. They moved her into Miami where my uncle lived and  moved her in just a little further away than mom is from me here.  That   s really close.  So I wanted to look after her. She stayed down in Texas too long and  didn   t take care of herself and she was focused entirely on my father  until after his death. She didn   t allow herself to be sick. A couple of  months after his death, she went in to a doctor for a check-up or because  she was feeling a little bit nauseous   I   ve forgotten which it was   and  her heart rate was 40 and she had to have a quadruple bypass. Of course  that had not happened in the six weeks since my father had died. She   d  been ignoring symptoms and pain for quite awhile   although you  women have less pain, not a reliable symptom of heart attack.  We put up with a lot. Well thank you very much for your time.  Thank you. It   s a pleasure, and it   s good to know that somebody is  looking at the accomplishments of women during that time period. Like  I say, the one thing that just floored me when I finally got it is the fact  that the political machine that my mother was going against was  essentially the KKK at that time.  That   s amazing, too.  Yes.  Interesting.  Yes. Well her dad   like I said, she was bigoted but she didn   t believe  that the African-Americans shouldn   t get their basic rights. All people  have got basic rights, but my mother said many, many times, the only  time that her dad ever really read her the Riot Act was during the  Depression. She had a group of friends and their families were all well-  21  to-do, and so they went down and drove by the line of people at the soup  kitchen. Her dad heard about it and he told her that those were good  people who just couldn   t find a job and having a bunch of upstart rich  kids embarrass them by driving along and snickering and laughing at  them being in line, if that happened again, he was going to have to strike  her.
