Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Today is July 14, 2008. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re doing an oral history  project called Women of the Oklahoma Legislature, and today I   m with  Rebecca Hamilton in her office at the State Capitol. She has served  twice   two different time periods.  About 16 years apart.  Elected in 1980 and served through    86, and then elected again in 2002  and currently serving. Thank you for having me today.  Well, you   re welcome.  I   d like to start by having you tell a little bit about your childhood,  where you were born, any siblings, and then we   ll move forward.  Well actually I was born in my district. I was born in my district in south  Oklahoma City and I grew up there. I lived there basically all my life.  My father was a mechanic at Armors, and then when that plant closed he  got a job with the city. A few years after that, he went to work at the  stockyards in my district. So he actually worked in my district. My  mother was a weigh master at the stockyards in my district. So I   m  really part of my district, part of my area. I graduated from Capitol Hill  High School, Jackson   we called it Junior High then   Jackson Junior  High and Capitol Hill High School. I guess those are the highlights of  my childhood.  No siblings?  Oh, yes. I have one sister, Brookie. She is three and a half years younger  than me.  5  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  And is she into politics?  No. (Laughs) No, she   s not.  Well in high school, were you interested in the political arena that  early?  A little bit. I got involved in a political campaign when I was 15, I think.  One of my teachers was running for office, and a lot of us volunteered to  help him. I went out one Saturday and put flyers on doors   knocked on  people   s doors and said,    Hello, I   m here for this person    and handed  them the flyer, and then did a thing where he drove us all around in a  pick-up and we yelled his name out.(Laughs) That was my initial  political involvement.  And then come 1980, you started thinking about it, or how did your first  turn come about?  Well I got involved in the women   s movement in the    70s. I was very  active in the Women   s Political Caucus. I was the state treasurer and I  was on the finance committee of the National Women   s Political  Caucus. There was a big push to try to ratify the Equal Rights  Amendment here in Oklahoma. And the man who represented the  district where I live was, I don   t want to say anything bad about  someone, but he was opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment. He was  kind of ugly with some of the people   the women who came up here to  lobby for it, and they were personally hurt by what he said. They didn   t  know I lived in his district, and they were looking for someone for years  and couldn   t find anybody. I just in a chance remark said,    Oh, well, I  live there,    and they were just all over me trying to get me to run. I said,     No,    for months and then finally decided,    Well, okay. I can do that,     and so I did. I didn   t know anything about what I was getting into, and I  had some people try to warn me that it was not pleasant running for  office, that I was going to be called horrible names and I would be  stunned by what people would say about me. I thought,    Oh, that   s no  big deal.    When it happened, I learned it was. (Laughs) It does hurt  when people say these things. I lost that election. That was in 1978, and  I lost that election by 21 votes.  Oh, close.  And so at that point, I was determined to run again. I do that. That   s just  the way I react to defeat. I was just absolutely determined that I was  going to run again and I was going to win, which I did in 1980. So I was  elected in 1980 and, as you mentioned, I served from    80 to    86.  6  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  So in    80, you won against an incumbent?  16 year incumbent, yes.  And who was your campaign manager that second time?  I   ve always managed my own campaigns.  Do you have a particular strategy?  I had a whole set of strategies. I learned how to run for office in the race  that I lost.  Okay.  Losing is actually very, very good for you in the long-run. It hurts a  whole lot when you do it, but it   s a great learning experience. The basic  strategy, I guess you could say, that I use is to be as   well, I work with  the district. I don   t concern myself with special interest groups or with  people outside the district. I look at what the people that I   m going to  represent need and what they want, what they care about. And since I  grew up there, it   s not any big stretch for me because I   m one of them. I  want the same things. I care about the same things. I do care about these  people, and so it   s easy for me to represent them. But that   s what I do  with my campaigns is I focus on my people in my district.  Do you have a slogan?  It changes every time, but I think the first time I was elected it was,    Put  Hamilton in the House,    which is pretty goofy. When I came back in  2002 it was,    She   s Not Just One of the Boys,    I think, or something like  that because I had two opponents at that time and they were both men.     She   s Not Just One of the Good    Ole Boys.    That was my slogan.  So in that race, were you up against an incumbent as well?  No. No, it was an open seat, but the two opponents were good  opponents. They were both very   well, they had all the support, not me.  In that difference in time, had campaigning changed quite a bit from the     80s to 2000?  Not too much   not in the little races. I think that the big difference is  that the computers   you now have computers. When I ran in 1980,  everything was by hand. We ordered mailing lists. We ordered labels  from a computer company in 1980, but other than that we kept all of our  7  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  records by hand. We did everything   I had big three-ring binders     those great big ones, those five-inch three-ring binders that I kept  records of every voter contact and everything. Everything we did was by  hand, and that took an army of volunteers.  Sure.  When I came back in 2002, everything   s by computer and I could do  that myself. So the big difference is that you don   t need nearly as many  volunteers to run a campaign, with computers doing so much of the  work. That   s good and bad. I mean, the involvement of the volunteers  is   losing that somewhat diminishes the power of democracy  unfortunately, I think.  I hadn   t thought of that.  It makes money more important and people less important, and that   s  not really good.  Well the first election   not the one you lost, but the second one, do you  remember the night of the election?  Oh, yes.  Watch party or whatever might be going on?  Yes. There was a huge crowd there because, as I said, I had to have a lot  of volunteers and I had a tremendous amount of help from people in the  women   s movement at that time. I   ve done a big change on one issue  and that   s abortion, and when I was elected in 1980   in the 1970   s I had  been the state director of NARAL. I was extremely pro-choice and so I  had a lot of people who were there. I think almost everybody was  actually there because of ERA, at that point, because that   s where the  big push was. I actually didn   t get much help from pro-choice people. I  mean, they liked me, but they didn   t do much for me. It was the ERA  people who were there. There was a big crowd there and it was fun. I   ve  tried winning. I   ve tried losing. Winning is a whole lot better. (Laughs)  It definitely is better.  What about your first swearing-in ceremony?  I don   t remember that as well. I do remember it. I have photos, and I  look like such a kid. I have all these friends who were there with me and  they all look so young. I was so broke   this is kind of an interesting  story. I was so broke, you know, I really am from my district, and my  district has the lowest income level of any district in the state. I was so  8  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  broke, I didn   t have any money to buy any clothes to be sworn-in with,  and so a friend of mine took me out and bought me a suit so that I would  have something to wear to my swearing-in (Laughs) ceremony. So that  was kind of neat, actually. That wasn   t bad. That was good.  Do you still have it?  Yes, yes   and I still have her. She   s still my friend.  That   s good, too. When you walked into the Capitol that first day, I  guess maybe every day, do you have a certain sense or feeling     I was a real kid back in 1980, and I walked in here with a bunch of my  friends and I said,    Where   s the House?    (Laughs) because I didn   t  know. The guy looked at me and he said,    Ma   am,    he said,    You   ve got  to go upstairs,    and he was really very firm about it. He said,    You don   t  go in here. You go upstairs,    and I said,    No. No. I   m a representative.  (Laughs) You   ve got to let me in.    (Laughs) And all my friends teased  me about that for a long time   you know,    Where   s the House?     (Laughs)  When I was first elected, that was before there had been many women in  the legislature. We were kind of a novelty back then, and they tried to  give me things to Xerox and they tried to ask me to go get them coffee  and all sorts of things. That never bothered me or offended me, but it  certainly embarrassed them. (Laughs) I always thought it was kind of  funny but it really embarrassed them. But back then we didn   t even have  a ladies restroom. They just made one for us outside the House, out of a  storage room, and it was pretty bad. (Laughs) Well it wasn   t bad, but it  was unusual. It was actually kind of fun.  Well did anyone take you under their wing?  Oh, yes. Yes. I had tremendous help. Representative Mike Fair, he   s a  republican, but he was a tremendous help to me. Representative Charles  Gray was a big help. Most of the other representatives from south  Oklahoma City tried to help me. Frank Shurden   representative   he  was a representative then he later became a senator   and so did Mike  Fair, he became a senator later. They both tried to help me. Of course I  met my husband here and he didn   t exactly take me under his wing, but  we certainly formed an alliance, I would say. We   ve been married a  quarter of a century (Laughs) and raised two kids.  I remember my first bill was a bill legalizing   it made rape by  instrumentation against the law, which had not been illegal before, and it  made it illegal for a man to rape his wife. Well, that   s kind of a  9  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  bombshell to put out on   back then, those were really controversial  ideas, very much so.  I can imagine.  So I talked to the different legislators about it and   they were all men  that I was talking to about it   and said,    I don   t know what to do and  I   m scared to go      and I was, I was. You don   t know what it   s like  standing up on that floor. There   s a world of difference between  watching a car wreck and being in one and standing up on that floor is a  lot different when you   re actually the one holding that mic. I mean, it is  scary and they all come at you and ask you questions. They can really  make you look like a fool, which is something most people fear a great  deal. I told them, I said,    I don   t know what I   m going to do. I don   t        We sat up here one night late trying to figure out how to help me pass  that bill. And what we did, and I   ve never told anyone this but I don   t  think he would mind now, I had another bill doing something or the  other   I don   t remember what   and they were both out on the floor.  And Frank Shurden said,    Well, what we   ll do is I   m going to amend  your bill to put my castration bill in it, and then there   s going to be this  huge fight.    He said,    Then you run your bill making spousal rape  against the law right after that, and they   ll be so exhausted from the fight  over the castration bill, they   ll just pass it and never even notice what  they   ve done.    There were about four or five of us who were involved in  this genius plan, and that   s exactly what we did and it worked.  And it worked?  And it worked. When I got the thing through the House, I couldn   t find a  Senate author to save myself. They would not touch it, and finally Frank  Keating stepped up. I   ll never forget that. He was a senator at that time,  and I had been through everybody in both parties, and I went to Frank  and he said   I still remember this because this was my first bill and I  was a scared kid   and he said,    Of course I   ll help you. What you   re  doing is right and it needs to be done and, yes, I will help you.    I have  never ever forgotten that about Frank Keating   and so anyway   yeah, I  had a lot of help.  Has it gotten any easier to do bills on the floor?  No, it   s much harder now. Oh, you mean handling things     Yes.     on the mic and stuff? Yes, it   s easier. I know what to do. It   s always  10  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  scary when you stand up. You never know what   s going to happen on  that floor, but no, I don   t get petrified before I handle a bill on the floor  anymore, if that   s what you   re asking.  Have you had any other bills that just stick out    the ones you   re  proudest of?  Well, I was the original author of the Protective Order here in  Oklahoma. It took me two years to pass that back in the day and the  major reason why is because it took me that long to get the chips to pass  it. That was a big coup because that was just unthinkable to pass that  here. That, I guess, and my first   I also got this capacity hotline for rape  victims here in Oklahoma. I got the funding   it wasn   t a piece of  legislation, but I got the funding to set up the first statewide   it was five  pilot programs around the state for adult daycare.  Okay.  And I was one of the people who worked on nursing home reform, and  back then nursing homes really, really, really needed reforming. Then  when I came back, I   ve done a lot of things in my second go-around that  I   m really proud of, too.  Can you tell us about those?  Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office.  Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came  back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of  controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary  author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the  log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting  that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the  republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too  but it took all of us. I think that   s something that people don   t realize.  We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that  matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That   s  terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that.  Let   s see   I passed a bill saying that you couldn   t put rape victims     private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important.  I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed  consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The  first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged  with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the  second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I  passed that. There again, that was actually Representative John Wright   s  11  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  bill, but in order to get it through I had to author it at the final thing, and  that   s an example of both parties working together. I really don   t know  that I passed that bill. I stepped in when I needed to step in to get it  through. I passed a bill this year making it a crime to beat up a pregnant  woman, which only took me five years.  Only five?  Only took me five years. So, yes, I   ve done some things I   m proud of  both times. It takes a long time to pass things when you   re talking about  people that other people feel justified in doing things to. You can tell  how much people   s human rights are being disregarded by how angry  people become when you try to stand up for them. You can always tell,  and right now it   s immigrants. Everybody hates immigrants, and you can  do anything you want to to them. If you stand up for them, you become  the object of a lot of the hatred that   s directed toward them. It   s the  unborn   if you do anything to stand up for the rights of unborn children,  then you are going to get really hit   and it   s always women   always. I  mean, it changes. When you   ve been in office as long as I have, you see  it change. It used to be black people. In the    80s, it was black people. It   s  not now, but now, I mean you say something really racist now and  you   re going to   if you wanted to say that, which I don   t   but if you  did, you   d be smacked down.  You can do almost anything you want to certain groups of people. It   s  like we   ve always got somebody we hate, and right now the number one  everybody hates is immigrants. They   re just not even like human beings.  We want to deny them medical care. We want to deny them an  education. We want to   and those things are human rights, basic human  rights, but it   s always women and it   s not just here in Oklahoma. You go  right around this globe and it will always be women. I mean there may  be the untouchables in India. There may be this and that and these and  those but it   s always women. There are always women in addition to  that, everywhere. When the day comes where standing up for women  doesn   t get me in trouble, I   ll know that we   re making some progress.  (Laughs)  Any forecast     I don   t know. I don   t know. After this race this spring, seeing the sexism  that came out in this  presidential  election this spring, I   m wondering if  we   ve made any progress at all. We have with people. It   s the powers  that be. I don   t know if you noticed that, but the people were very  willing to elect a woman for president. It was   in fact the    boy   s club     had to run over the people to keep from doing it. So, you know, it   s got a  ways to go.  12  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  At least we have had  women  lieutenant governors.  Yeah. We have a wonderful lieutenant governor  Jari Askins  right now.  And Mary Fallin.  She   s a great lady, too. I like her very much. I like both of them.  Well you were here pre-dome and post-dome. Did you have any  comments about that, one way or the other?  The dome doesn   t matter to me. (Laughs) I don   t care about the dome.  Some have and some haven   t. Well what would you consider your  political philosophy? You   ve said some of it   do you have anything else  you want to add about that?  Well, I think that my political philosophy now is different than it was. I  wouldn   t have said that I had a political philosophy at first. To use this  power that I have   you only have it for awhile and when you have it,  it   s almost like magic. I mean, you can make things happen when you   ve  got    R-E-P    in front of your name   to use this power to do as much  good for people as I can and to save as many lives as I can, that is what I  try to do.  On your break between    86 and coming back, what prompted you to  come back?  You know, I don   t know. I seem to run for office without knowing why.  (Laughs) I found out that the guy that was leaving, the man who had  had it before   Charles Gray, who was a friend of mine   was leaving,  and I really debated on   filing is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,  and it closes at five o   clock on Wednesday. On Tuesday, I was just  driving everybody crazy trying to decide what to do. I drove my husband  so nuts, he went to bed, which is what he does. He just listens to me until  he just gets   I talk and talk, talk, talk, talk, talk when I   m making a  decision and he   d had it and he went to bed. So I called a friend of mine  in California and talked to him until midnight trying to decide what I  should do. I remember he said to me, he said,    Well, if you file you will  win.    And I said,    Well, I         what I finally decided to do was file and  then I had until Friday to change my mind and withdraw. (Laughs)  I was actually that unsure about what I wanted to do, and then, as usual,  people started coming at me trying to make me leave the race. I would  guess, no one told me this, but I would guess that they knew that I was  someone they needed to eliminate anyway they could   and once that  13  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  started, I was in. Once you start trying to push me around, I just fight. I  mean   yeah, that   s just what always happens with me. You can be nice  to me and get me just totally    wussed    out of everything. I mean, you  can talk me out of anything by being nice to me, but you start fighting  with me and I will just fight right back at you.  In    86 you chose not to run again, right?  Yes. I had a baby. I made one of the best decisions I ever made. I stayed  home with my kids for 16 years.  And once your 12 years is up, what do you think you   ll do next?  Oh, I don   t know, die, I guess. I   ll be so old  (Laughs) I don   t know. I  don   t foresee running for any other office. I   m writing a book right now,  and we   ll see if that gets published. It may cause a lot of controversy  because I   m actually talking about some of the same things that I   ve  been talking about here in this interview, and that seems to cause a lot of  people to get upset. And so it might or might not   assuming it even gets  published. I don   t know. I don   t have a publisher. I   m just writing it.  I also want to do work for   I have incorporated, and I need to advance a  group called Oklahoma Democrats for Life, and that will be an affiliate  of the National Democrats for Life of America. The whole purpose of  that organization is not just abortion. It   s about a consistent life ethic.  We tend to try to splice life up, and you   ve got one party saying,    Well,  we   re for life after birth,    and then you   ve got this other party saying,     Well, we   re for life before birth,    and well, you know, maybe we need  to look at it all and take care of it. So that   s what this organization is  about, and that   s true on the national level, too, is espousing   electing  pro-life democrats, developing a pro-life voice within the democratic  party, and working toward legislation that will enhance the basic human  right to life of all human beings from conception to natural death     which is my belief. I mean, that   s my concern   and not pit one person   s  right to life against another the way we do with abortion. So I want to  work on that organization, and I have another organization that I   m  starting as well. Now what will happen with any of that, you just do  these things and then see what happens.  You may end up lobbying some?  Oh, I don   t like lobbying   the thought of lobbying. If I did lobby, it  would be for some cause. I   m not a hired gun. I don   t have the  temperament or the personality for that.  If some woman came up to you and asked you what your advice would  14  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  be if she was thinking about running, what would you tell her?  I   d tell her to do it. We need women in office. You can   t have good  government unless all the people are represented, and that means all the  people, both men and women. Men cannot speak for women. They try  and I   m not saying men are bad, because they   re not. Some of the best  people I know   the two I gave birth to are both men  But the fact is, you  can   t speak from someone else   s experience. You can only speak from  your own and for a government to be truly representative, it needs to  have women in it. Also, women have an emotional intelligence and a  dynamic that men simply don   t have. We are not just little guys with  higher voices, we are the life-bearers of the human race and we have a  tremendous amount of perspective that if you take it out of the public  debate, you lose so much that you don   t ever get good government.  Good government comes from having that perspective as well as the  perspective that men bring.  Just on a practical note, I don   t think it would have taken five years to  pass the bill about beating up pregnant women, as a for-instance, if the  House had had 90 women and 11 men. I think it was   and this really  makes these guys mad when I say this (Laughs)   I mean, I got in major  trouble for saying this last spring, but it   s just the truth. It   s not that they  are cold and cruel and uncaring, it   s that it always falls to the bottom of  the list. Now some of them are cold and cruel and uncaring, but most of  them aren   t.  There   s   what, 18 other women right now, 17.  There have been 11 women in the House and then there are some  women in the Senate.  Okay. So do you do things together after hours?  We   re trying to. The partisanship up here has been very destructive. It   s  destructive first of all to us as people because we   re in such a froth of  hatred toward one another, and that   s just not a healthy way to be   and  it separates people unnecessarily. Then secondly, it   s very destructive to  our government and it   s ultimately very destructive to the people and to  the country. It is getting better. It really was much better this year, and I  do believe that was the change in Speakers. I think Chris Benge is a very  nice man, and I think that   s why it got better. It is getting better, and I  hope it continues to get better because we really need to understand that  we   re going to disagree about things because we are different people and  we represent different constituencies.  It would be an immoral thing for me to represent my district by voting  15  Finchum  Hamilton  the way   well it wouldn   t be representing my district for me to vote the  way that the representative from Nichols Hills would vote because I  would be doing things that would be harmful to the interest of the people  that I represent   the people to whom this office really belongs. On the  other hand, if he started voting the way I do, it would be immoral for  him. It would be wrong. We need to accept that. What makes democracy  work is you have a lot of different people from different backgrounds  with different ideas who are thrown together, and yes you fight. You  have to   I mean, these are things you care about very deeply, and so  you   re going to argue and you   re going to get angry when someone  comes against you in your closest beliefs. But that doesn   t mean that you  hate the other person and that doesn   t mean that you turn it into some  sort of vendetta. That just means that you   re different, that when you do  that, that   s how you get really good decisions because nobody   s left out.  That   s how you get government that works for all the people is if  everybody has a say.  When you get into this partisanship   and it was the most discouraging  thing I   ve ever experienced in politics the last few years. When I was in  office in the    80s, you could talk to the people you were serving with  about a piece of legislation and just discuss what it would do to people,  the impact it would have on their lives, and you could get their vote if  you could convince them that it would do a good thing. They would  change their vote based on that. When I came back up here, especially  the last two or three years, they don   t care. The one argument you can  never make that will have any impact is how it   s going to affect people  because they don   t care. All they care about is getting each other. All  they care about is getting power and keeping power. All they care about  is the Republican Party versus the Democratic Party and the power. Now  when it gets down to that point, that   s really bad government and it   s  really destructive to the people who are in office. I look at them and I  feel sorry for them because I keep thinking,    You   re wasting this time  you have when you could be doing so much good. You   re throwing it  away, and you   re never going to get it back. I mean, you may do other  things, but you   re never going to get this chance to do this good ever  again, and you need to do it while you can.    I might as well be talking to  that thing as my colleagues. It   s gotten better this year. Leadership really  matters.  Sure.  Who the leader is really matters. It just kind of amazes me but I   m old  enough now   I   ve seen it over and over again   people just adopt the  attitudes of their leader. So I   m glad we had a change in leadership, and  I think this is a much better situation. I hope it does better as time goes  by.  16  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  There hasn   t been a woman Speaker, has there?  No. No. There should be, too, I think. I think that we need to as   I   ve  said what I think which is that you   I don   t know if I made it clear, we  need both men and women, not one or the other. That goes for what I  was saying about the Democratic Party and pro-life. I   m not trying to  run pro-choice people out of the party. I think they raise valid issues. I   m  not afraid at all to discuss this with anyone. We just need to make it  where people can follow their own conscience.  Do you think this changing attitude came with term limits or was it     Term limits has been very destructive. Term limits has been extremely  destructive because it eliminated anybody who knows what they   re  doing. This is an extremely complex job. I don   t understand why people  think that running a government is something that you always want a  neophyte doing. (Laughs) My feeling about term limits is that voters  could kick you out any time they wanted to and that   s the way it should  be. What we   ve done with term limits is we   ve created a situation where  we constantly have these people who are just totally green. So many of  them think they were anointed and not elected and they   re arrogant. I  realized after awhile, part of their arrogance is because they don   t know  what they   re doing and they   re scared somebody   s going to figure it out  and so they act arrogant to cover that. But no, term limits is very  destructive.  Any way to reverse that?  A vote of the people would be   I suppose someone could bring a court  case. That   s what happened on the federal level. The Supreme Court  ruled that   and they saved the country, in my opinion, by ruling against  term limits on the federal level. I mean, we don   t need a revolving door  with our Congress. As I said before, we need probably reforms to try to  eliminate money having so much power in elections, but we don   t need  term limits. That   s not an effective or good reform.  Let   s back up a little bit. You said you left the first time, you got married  to a fellow     I got married in    83.  Was he in the House or Senate     He was in the House     at that time, too?  17  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Yes.  Have others done that? Do you know?  Twyla Gray did that. Representative Twyla Gray   she   s now a judge,  district judge   and Representative Charles Gray married. She left the  legislature and then ultimately ended up a district judge, and he left for  awhile and then came back and ran for office again and served. Those  are the only two I know of besides us.  Well when you two   did one of you have to move     Well he was out of office at that time. Twyla and Charlie got, I think, a  Supreme Court decision or an Attorney General   s decision, one or the  other, saying that they could live in their respective House districts   but  then Charlie left. I think he did that partly to clarify that for her, but no,  we   ve never had to deal with that at all. I think that would be pretty  complex.  Are your boys interested in politics?  They   re interested, but I don   t know that they   re interested in running.  They certainly have opinions (Laughs) about it.  It   s discussed around the dinner table?  Not too much. I don   t talk about it a lot. I talk endlessly to my husband,  but I don   t really talk to my kids. I try not to bring it home. I   m kind of  two people. When I   m up here, I   m Representative Hamilton. I tell  people when I get out of that car in the parking lot, it   s not just I   m  Representative Hamilton, I   m District 89 when I get out of that parking  lot. When I step out of that car, I am the people of District 89. And there  are a lot of things sometimes that I fight about that I wouldn   t fight  about if it was just me, but when somebody pushes me around up here,  they   re pushing them around so I have to. At home, I   m just    Mom    and  I don   t have to do any of that. (Laughs)  You live close enough where you can live at home?  Yes. I just live about 10-12 miles from the Capitol. Yes.  Has it been difficult managing family with     No, because my kids were older and my husband, as a former House  member, knew. But no, I can   t say that I have had any trouble at all  managing it. The truth of the matter is, if my family needed me, I   d be  18  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  out of here tomorrow.  So describe a typical day. How early do you get here during session?  Well when we   re in session, I   m not a person who gets up early and  comes rushing out to the Capitol. Some of these guys get out here at  5:30 or 6:00 in the morning. Well they   re farm boys and that   s how  they   they always get up early. I   m a city girl so (Laughs) I sleep in. I  tend to get here   it depends entirely on what I have. If I have an  appointment, I come for the appointment. If I have a committee meeting,  I come for the committee meeting. If I don   t have anything, sometimes  we come in to session early and we stay. I don   t come until I need to. I  can do most of my business   thanks to computers and the phone and e-mail,  I can do a tremendous   I can run this office from my house and  do. But I get out here when I need to be out here and I go to whatever I  need to, and it   s very hard to describe. There isn   t a typical day in the  legislature. Every day is different     That   s what I keep hearing.     which is what makes it fun.  Sure. Sure.  There are a lot of things about this job, but boredom is not usually a  problem.  Have you chaired committees?  Oh, yes.  Any particular ones?  Well in the    80s I chaired the Health Committee, which was a huge  omnibus committee at that time. Then when I came back, Speaker Adair  offered me the chairmanship of Commerce, Industry and Labor, and I  chaired that for two years. So I   ve chaired those two committees and the  Health Committee was more challenging because it was much bigger, a  much bigger committee.  Have you gotten to travel much with the job?  I could. I don   t. I do occasionally, but very seldom. I just don   t ask for  travel.  So are you campaigning this summer?  19  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  No. I didn   t get an opponent so I don   t have to campaign, which I   m  glad about.  Does that happen very often?  Well it happened in 2004 and then I had an opponent in 2006. So maybe  it   s every other time. I don   t know.  Well I   m sure cost-wise it   s probably changed quite a bit from the    80s  to now.  A little bit. I was surprised at   when I was re-elected in 2002, I only  spent  5,000 dollars and my opponent spent over  100,000 dollars so it  varies. This last time I spent about  26,000 dollars on my race in 2006,  which isn   t too far off from what I spent in the    80s, actually. The  computer does make it   the big change is postage is a lot more  expensive. However, the computer makes it possible to do a lot of other  things a lot cheaper and so it kind of   yeah, it   s more expensive but I  don   t do one of these big races where you go on the television and stuff  like that. That   s where it gets outlandish very quickly. I actually don   t  know how some of these people spend all the money they spend. I don   t  know what they   re doing. They   re not doing what I do.  Inside the city, it   s easier just to walk and knock on doors, I guess.  I do that and I design all my own mailings. I have a big printer and I  print a lot of my own mailings. The printer that I use   my commercial  printer   s very reasonable. I just do a lot of things myself, and it saves a  large amount of money. I don   t pay anybody. If somebody   s working for  me, they volunteer   putting up yard signs or whatever.  On the floor, where   s your seat this time around?  I was right behind the democratic floor leader on the   one back from  the front.  Have you been on the back row before?  Yes. I like it back there actually. I   m going to have so much seniority  compared to everyone else. I could pretty well sit   except for the  Speaker   s desk or something   I could sit wherever I want. I have been  debating,    Do I want to go back to the back row or do I want to        There are advantages to both. In the back row, the television cameras  can   t get you and so you can slouch or pick your nose or whatever you  want to do and (Laughs) and in the front, the television, they   re on you  all the time and I tend to forget it. I   ve been very fortunate they haven   t  20  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  put me on television saying, you know,    Here she is drooling,    or  whatever (Laughs) but, you know, I   m sure I look pretty goofy  sometimes because anybody does when they sit someplace for 12 hours,  but the nice thing about being in the front is you have access to the  Chair. You have access to the floor leader. You have access to all these  people and when you   re working legislation, that really is nice. So I  don   t know. I haven   t made up my mind     In the middle?     where I want to sit. No, that   s one I don   t   I   ll either be at the back or  the front. (Laughs) I don   t know which one.  Do they count your previous years into your seniority years?  Yeah, yeah. I   ve got more seniority than anybody in either House. I   m  number one in seniority.  Interesting   and you get to pick your seatmate as well or you pick your  spot and then they pick?  Well, it   s a mutual thing. You don   t just say, well,    You   ve got to be my  seatmate,    and, I don   t know. My seatmate is terming out this time,  Representative Darrell Gilbert who I was very   we got along really  well, had a good time together. Before that, my seatmate was Ray Miller  for two terms   four years we sat together, and I enjoyed both of them.  Your seatmate   s important because you sit there and talk about stuff and  so it   s important you have a seatmate that you like   but I haven   t really  thought about that. We   ll decide that after the election in November.  So the very last day of session, is there any particular traditions that go  on?  Well there   s a lot of   the last day of session   s always a    Chinese fire  drill.    We   re trying to pass bills and we just have the very last minute to  do it. And it   s complicated passing a bill under any circumstances, but it  especially is the last day because you have to pass it through the  House   let   s say it   s a House bill. You have to pass it through the  House. Then you   ve got to get it engrossed, get it through that process,  get it over to the Senate, get it called up, get them to vote on it, and it  may have to come back to the House, you never know. So if anything  goes, you can lose bills in a heartbeat that last day and if you   re not  really on it, you will.  I just hate having bills come up on the last day because the pressure   s so  extreme trying to get them through. If it   s a Senate bill, it   s the reverse.  21  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  They   ve got to get it heard. They   ve got to get it to you. You   ve got to  get it heard, and there   s so many people you   ve got to get to agree to get  it through that last day. And they   re tired and they   re   I mean, they   re  really worn out and everybody   s on top of everybody else, and so it   s a  very complex thing the last day. By the time we get to actual sine die,  most of the fight   s been beaten out of us and we   re (Laughs) just really  glad that we   re able to yell    sine die    and go out, but that part   s kind of  fun.  You actually yell it?  Yes, well we usually yell and we tend to   used to, when we had a lot of  paper on the floor before we went to computers, when we printed the  bills out, we   d throw it all up in the air and that sort of thing. When  session   s over, it   s kind of like being thrown off a horse because it   s just  pandemonium and you   re working extremely long hours. You  basically   you don   t even get enough sleep. You spend all your time up  here the last few weeks, and if you   re not up here you   re still fussing  about it and you can   t   you go home and dream about it because it   s so  intense and then you   it   s just over. I mean, pfftt   over, and it takes  two or three days to get halfway normal again, and that   s if you   re a  pretty fast adapter. When it stops it is so sudden and so complete, there   s  almost a feeling of amputation. I mean it just   I mean all of a sudden,  there   s   and so there is an adaption every time you sine die.  Do some wait to present their bill on that day or   ?  Nobody wants to present their bill on that day. It just happens to you.  I   ve never heard anybody say,    Boy, I   d love to present my bill (Laughs)  on the last day.     So you get something through?  Well and see policy, if you   re someone who is the Speaker or someone  like that   and I   m not saying that the Speaker does this   but if you  were in that position, you would have control of the process and so you  could   but even the Speaker has   or, let   s say you   re the Pro Tempore  of the Senate, it doesn   t matter, whichever one, you only have control of  one body and then of course nobody controls the governor and it takes  all three to make law. So the further back you do it, the best or the more  time you have to correct mistakes and that   s important.  My last question is when history is written about you, what would you  like for it to say?  Oh, I don   t care. I   ll be dead. (Laughs) I don   t care what it says. I just  22  Finchum  Hamilton  Finchum  Hamilton  want to do the best I can now.  Okay. Well that   s it for me. Anything else you want to say?  No, I don   t think so.  Well, thank you very much.  You   re welcome. Thank you.  --- -------
