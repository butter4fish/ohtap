  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Okay, today is October 10, 2007 and I   m in Oklahoma City at the  Capitol. I   m talking with Sally Kern who is in the House of  Representatives. Elected in 2004     Correct.  Re-elected in 2006.  Unopposed.  Unopposed.  That was nice.  And this is part of the Oklahoma State University   s project titled     Women of the Oklahoma Legislature.    Thank you for having me today.  Oh, glad to do it.  Let   s start by having you tell a little about your childhood, where you  were born and then we   ll work forward.  Okay, well I was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas back in 1946. So, I   m one  of these people that I don   t mind telling you how old I am. I thank the  Lord for everyday I   ve had, so that   s not a problem. I was born to  Marvin Rogers and Ruby Rogers and they were both from Arkansas. My  dad graduated from Arkansas State University. That   s the first time I  thought about this, I don   t think my mother graduated from college. But  anyway, we grew up and my dad was in insurance. He was with a  particular company and he would get a promotion and go to another  place. Then he ended up getting headquartered in Dallas, Texas and so  we   d be in Dallas and we   d move to Wichita, Kansas then back to  5  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Dallas; Kennett, Missouri back to Dallas; Wichita, Kansas back to  Dallas; Liberal, Kansas   that   s where I ended up finally graduating  from high school. They moved back to Dallas after he retired and then I  went to college.  In Texas?  Yes I did. To begin with, I started off at Wayland Baptist University in  Plainview, Texas. Transferred to Arkansas State University and would  have graduated from there but my dad was in a very serious accident. It  happened right when finals started so I finished finals and went home  and got a job working for Proctor and Gamble. I just turned my check  over to my mother because my dad couldn   t work anymore. She was a  real estate agent and in insurance. My whole family has been in  insurance, so I said I would never be in insurance. But I worked for  about, oh, almost a year and during that time, I met my husband. From  the time I first met him to the time we got married was about six months.  I wasn   t going to get married. I was going to be an old maid missionary.  But when I met him, I just knew he was the right person. I had always  felt like I was going to be a missionary and was very content and happy  with that. And then when I met him, I just knew he was the one. So we  got married, been married thirty-eight years next January.  There were higher plans.  I would say there was. I ended up graduating from University of Texas  at Arlington about a year after we were married. I think it was December  of 1971. And he was working   what was Steve doing at the time? Well,  when I met him he was in bonds. He ended up going back to college. He  went to Atlantic College  now called Palm Beach Atlantic University   down in West Palm Beach, Florida. We got down there because we  started working through a ministry called The True Vine and we were  sent down there to work with street kids. This was back in the early     70   s, middle    70   s. While we were down there, he felt called to preach  and so that   s when he went to school at Palm Beach Atlantic College.  And when he graduated from there we went back to Texas and he went  to school at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.  We ended up moving from Fort Worth over to Dallas, not far from  where my parents lived. My dad had, by that time   he couldn   t go back  into insurance after his accident so he and my brother started a janitorial  business. After his first semester of Seminary, Steve went over there and  we got a place to live. Steve worked nights in my father   s janitorial  business and would go to school during the day. We had a baby then,  our first child, Jesse, at that time. So I was a stay-at-home mom. When  he graduated from Seminary, when was that? Golly, 1978 I think it was.  6  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  We went to our first pastorate in Lone Star, Texas down in East Texas  and we were there eight years. During that time was when I went back to  school and got my teacher certification. I had graduated, like I say, from  University of Texas at Arlington, but I didn   t have a teaching degree.  And I went back when the boys got into school. We had another son,  too; Nathan came along two years later. Once the boys both got into  school, I went back to school at night and got my teaching certification  and started teaching school there in east Texas. And we were there eight  years and in    88 we moved.  My husband took a pastorate up in Boise, Idaho. Grandparents were very  upset with us but that   s where we felt the Lord was calling us. So we  went to Boise, Idaho and we were there seven years. Our oldest son  graduated from high school there and came down to Oklahoma and went  to college at OBU  Oklahoma Baptist University . My mother was dying  and so my husband resigned from the church so we came down and  lived about a year with my folks. And I subbed in Texas and Steve  worked at Central Freight and preached here and there. About the same  time my mother died, the Lord opened a pastorate up here in Oklahoma  City and that was 1996, I think it was March of    96. So Steve came up  here and I stayed down the rest of the school year with my dad and our  son who was graduating from high school down there. And then we  came up here at the end of the school year and have been here ever  since.  More than seven or eight years this time.  Oh yes, yes. It   s been a little over eleven, I believe. We   re going to retire  here. My husband is the pastor of Olivet Baptist Church, an inner-city  church here in Oklahoma City.  What subjects did you teach?  I always taught government. I was a social studies teacher and all the  years that I taught, the one subject that I always taught every year was  government. I also taught world history some and U.S. history,  economics, and when I came here to Oklahoma I got a job teaching at an  inner-city school in Oklahoma City and I taught government. And I also  taught some Oklahoma history and economics and geography.  So you came by the political arena naturally, perhaps.  Well, I don   t know if you   d say naturally. I never, ever, ever   I can  honestly say, not once, dreamed of being in politics, running for office.  Because I was teaching government, I was very much involved in it as  far as on the national level. That   s pretty much what we studied in public  7  Finchum  Kern  schools. And I always voted. That   s our constitutional right and  privilege. I would motivate my students to see that this was their  government and they needed to have a voice in it and they needed to do  that first and foremost by voting. I had contacted my representatives, my  elected officials in the past quite often. But you   re looking at a person  who, before I felt led to run, had never attended a precinct meeting, had  never been to, say, a political club, a Republican Women   s Club, had  never been to a county meeting or state meeting. And so I guess you  want to know how did I get here.  Yes, that   s my next question.  Well my husband being a pastor and our church being down there in the  inner-city off of 10th and Western right in that area, the state  representative for that area asked him one time to come and be chaplain.  Then he was asked by our senator right where we lived, we lived in  Northwest Oklahoma City area. He was asked twice so three different  occasions   he was the chaplain here in the legislature for a week. He  would come home each time and he would say to me,    Sally, you ought  to run for office. You know government and I   ve met some of those  guys and you could do this.    I would just laugh at him and say,    You  must be kidding.    I was not interested in the least.  I was very happy, very fulfilled being a minister   s wife, of course being  a mother to two wonderful sons, and was very happy teaching school. I  loved teaching school, I loved being with young people. And I had the  opportunity to coach here in Oklahoma City. I was a girl   s softball  coach, volleyball coach and golf coach. I do love golf. So I was very  content. I loved my job. Both sons were out of the home by now and so I  could really devote a lot of time to my church and to teaching and I was  very happy. And I just literally laughed at him and said,    You must be  kidding.    Well after the third time that he was chaplain here, he didn   t  say anymore and I didn   t say anything because I wasn   t interested.  I found myself one day in class, we were talking about politicians and  campaigns and the prevailing attitude of my students was this:  politicians are all crooked and they are all rich. And I made a statement  that day, I said,    Look, some are just like in any profession, you   ve got  crooked people.    I said,    They all aren   t and one of these days Mrs.  Kern may run for office and I hope you know that I   m not rich. After all  I   m just a school teacher and a minister   s wife. And I hope you know  I   m a person of integrity.    So I went home that evening after school and  I   m sitting there in my recliner   I remember this just like yesterday.  And I   m thinking,    Why in the world did you say that?    And I never  said a word to my husband. Well you know how an idea just gets in the  back of your mind and gnaws at you and won   t go away? Well that was  8  this idea and it just stayed and I continued to deal with it and never said  anything to my husband.  Finally as a Christian, I felt that maybe I should pray about this. So I  began praying about it and the more I prayed about it, the more I felt like  I should run. And to be quite honest with you, that   s when I said,    No  Lord, no way, this will get me out of my comfort zone. I don   t want to  do this.    So I said no and I struggled. I was miserable for close to a year.  No Christian should say    no    to the Lord and struggle like that,  especially you would think a preacher   s wife wouldn   t do that. So finally  there came a point when I said,    You know Lord if you want me to run,  I   ll run. Even though I don   t want to do it I will.    And I just had peace.  So I told my husband. I remember I was sitting in the recliner again and  he came home one evening and he walked in the door and I looked at  him and the first thing I said was,    I   m running.    And he looked at me  and said,    For what?    And I said,    I   m running for office.    And he said,     Really?    So I told him how I   d been struggling and all this. And so he  said,    Okay.    So here I am.  I didn   t know anybody up at the Capitol. I   ll be honest with you, I had  never been to our Capitol either. I mean, I didn   t know anybody. Steve  had met an individual who had been in the Senate for four years, had  served under Governor Keating. And Steve had met her at various  meetings and he said,    You need to talk to this individual because she  can help you out and give you some advice.    So I called her up and we  met and had lunch, about a three and a half hour lunch one day and our  hearts just bound together. So she was my political adviser. I didn   t pay  her anything, she wouldn   t take anything. I did everything on my own. I  was still teaching school and I would stay up late working on designing  my own brochures and campaign stuff. And I would call my friend and  say,    Well, what do you think about this?    When something needed to  be mailed out, my Sunday school class that I was a member of helped. I  would have twenty-five ladies and some gentlemen in the house and we  would be stuffing envelopes and putting stamps on and writing. And just  did all of this.  I had another friend that became a very dear friend who I got to know  through all of this. I   m not going to name any names, but her husband  happened to run the same year that I did and won. She had been working  up here and so she introduced me to a lot of people and was very  helpful. And so when I started running, I really thought that I would run  and lose and just be a much better government teacher for having gone  through that process. And there were five of us. It was the first year we  had term limits and my predecessor could not run again. There were five  of us in the primary. And about a few months before the primary I  wanted to win. I had gotten invested in the process. I had learned a  9  Finchum  Kern  whole lot.  I had a real good sense of where I stood with the people because I  knocked on thousands of doors. I got around my district three times. My  husband got around once and I had some other friends who got around.  So I wanted to win and in the primary, I came in first with about thirty-one  percent and my predecessor   s wife, who had gotten in only four or  four and a half months before the primary, came in second. And so, you  know that really scared me because I thought,    Oh no, she just got in.  She came in second. She   s just building up this momentum and we   re  going to have a run off in three weeks.    So I worked my tail off those  three weeks and I beat her 60-40. And fortunately my district is a very  conservative district and I did have a democrat in    04. I think I won  almost 69, just under 69 percent to 31. And so here I am and in    06. I did  not have an opponent and it   s been a wonderful experience. It   s been a  challenging experience. It   s been a learning experience, a growing  experience, a frustrating experience   just an awesome experience.  I   m very honored to be here. I am not a lifelong politician. I don   t even  like to refer to myself as a politician. I try to refer to myself as an elected  official or a state   s person because being a government teacher and a  lover of the beginning of our nation and American history, I   ve studied  our founding fathers a lot and spent a lot of time on that when I taught  government. I think we need statesmen today where their primary goal is  to serve the people. And that   s what I want to be. I have no higher  political aspirations. I don   t fault anybody that does because somebody   s  got to want to be our next governor, senator, or congressman. I don   t  have anything like that. I   m proud and honored to serve right where I  am. And I try to get out in my district as much as I can. I go to the  schools. I try to read. I go to the school carnivals. I do get OU/OSU  football tickets and I give them to my schools so that they can use them  to raise money to buy whatever the principal thinks they need. I donated  the OU/Texas tickets to the Northwest Chamber of Commerce and they  brought in  850 this year. So I try to be out there with the people. I   m  still learning every day. I would try to tell my students there is never a  day without learning and boy have I learned that being here these past  three years.  What was your very first day in office like? Do you remember swearing  in?  Oh man it was scary and it was very awesome and emotional. I was so  full of pride when I took that oath because I   m a very patriotic person.  When 9/11 happened, if I had been younger I would have gone and  signed up. I was the first person on my block with the American flag out  there and it hasn   t gone down since. I got a new flag though. I was just  10  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  so proud. So proud to be an American. So proud to an Oklahoman. After  they swear us in, they punch our button and we get the opportunity to  say something. I could hardly speak without tears because I was so  honored and so proud. This is not anything I ever dreamed about. For  many of them, this is a fulfillment of a dream. I   m just really honored  and privileged to be here. I know that I   m here because this is where the  Lord wanted me to serve first of all Him and secondly my constituents  and all the great citizens of the state. It   s just a wonderful honor.  What has been your biggest hurdle to date?  Gosh, it seems like there   s been so many hurdles. You know, on one  hand I   ve felt like I understood the political process a little bit because I  taught it but then there   s one thing to say theory and then practicality.  And just understanding the bills that you read is the biggest hurdle. I do  read all of my bills. I think that   s my obligation. And when we   re in  session, I very seldom get to bed before 1:00am. I read my bills. Now I  must confess, that doesn   t mean I understand everything I read. But I  read them all. Those that I don   t understand there are some colleagues,  that I feel like we have kindred spirits if you want to put it that way, they  help me and we all do that. We can   t be an expert in everything. And  I   m certainly not an expert in anything. But if there is one area that I  know more about it is education. And so when I read an education bill or  something dealing with that, I understand it.  I have a lot of my colleagues that say they look to see how I   m going to  vote on an issue, how I   m going to vote on a particular education bill.  And then I have those that I trust that   okay, I read this bill, what  exactly does this mean here? What would be the consequences, etcetera,  etcetera. And they tell me where they stand on it, what they think it  means. And then I look at it again and I understand it a little bit better.  Bottom line is I still make my own choice. I always make my own  choice but I do depend upon some of my trusted colleagues to help me  understand some things. So that   s the biggest challenge for me.  How does it feel being one of the minority women of the group? I think  there   s nineteen in both chambers this year  2007 .  Well I think you   re about right. Well, to be honest with you I compare it  to when I was teaching and being the women   s coach. There   s just the  good old boy club, okay, in public schools among the coaches. And  we   re women so we   re not in there. There   s that here.  Still?  Yes, there still is. Now I do not mean by that that the men are not polite,  11  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  they are; that they are not thoughtful, they are; that they   re not helpful,  they are. But personally, I   m not going to go hang out with the men  because I do not think that would be appropriate. Guys can just hang out  with guys. To me, that   s just the way it is. You can   t change it, fine. I  don   t have a problem with that. Sometimes when it comes to placing  people on different committees or doing things, perhaps the women  might be a little slighted. But you know, the way I look at it, it   s not  about me. I   m not here to make a name for myself, I   m not here to make  sure that I get recognized here or get on this. I   m here to serve my  constituents and that   s a big enough job right there. You know, I don   t  need all the other. Now if something were to come and that   s what I feel  like I   m supposed to do, well my motto is    God   s grace is sufficient.  He   ll give me what I need to handle every task He puts before me.    But  the way I look at it, I   m old enough to be most   not all, but most of  these guy   s mother. And so I just kind of treat them like that.  You just can   t beat the women, especially the republican women. I   m  much closer to them than I am to the ones on the other side of the aisle. I  feel a kinship with them too but my republican women colleagues are  just like sisters. I just love them to death. It   s just a unique   I don   t want  to say club, but it   s a unique experience. There are fifty-seven  republicans. We have caucus meetings together. We go out to eat  together. We have a caucus retreat every year together. It   s just like a  family. And yes, you   re closer to some in your family than you are  others, and I   m closer to some than others. But we   re all family. There   s  not a single one of them that I don   t love and wouldn   t stand up for.  We   ll change the subject just a little bit. Do you remember your first bill  that you presented on the floor?  Oh gosh.  Do you remember if you were nervous or not?  I   m trying to think   the very first one? I   m not a hundred percent    I do  know that I was nervous. I   m really a little bit nervous every time I do  because it   s just a unique experience and you never know whether  you   re going to get drilled from the other side of the aisle or maybe even  some of your own colleagues. But I think probably my first bill was a  bill dealing with reading. Because that   s one of the things that I  campaigned on. If you can read, you can learn. If you can   t read, you  can   t learn. Because as a teacher, that   s what I saw. I saw twelfth  graders, that   s mainly who I taught. The vast majority of them in the  school where I was teaching either could not read or if they did read,  they couldn   t read well and they could not comprehend what they read.  So you have to ask yourself the question,    What kind of education have  12  Finchum  Kern  those students received after twelve, counting kindergarten, thirteen  years of school?    Not the best, not what they should have received.  I always talk to a lot of teachers. I have teacher friends down in Texas  who taught in elementary school from Lone Star where we lived. And I  called and talked to them. They   re the ones that gave me the phrase,    If  you can read, you can learn.    Here   s what they told me. From  kindergarten to third grade you are learning to read. After third grade,  you are reading to learn. So it   s like a foundation. When you build a  house, we don   t do the wall first, we don   t do the ceiling or the roof first.  You start with the foundation and you must have a strong foundation. If  you don   t have a strong foundation, then it doesn   t matter how  expensive the rest of the materials may be. You are going to have cracks.  You are going to have problems. And my philosophy is,    if children are  going to learn, they   ve got to be able to read. Reading is not a subject  matter like history, English, science, math. Reading is a skill and you  need to have that skill down and have it down well so that you can  master the subject matters.     So my first bill that I ran with Senator Wilcoxson was to allow teachers  from kindergarten through third grade to spend more time in reading and  teach the other competencies through reading. It was part of the Reading  Sufficiency Act, we expanded upon that. You can read to students about  science, about history. So that was my first bill and each year, the three  years that I   ve been in, I   ve been able to pass a bill dealing with reading.  And I think, in time, as we have those children, in their foundational  years, really learning how to read they   re going to grasp everything else  as they get farther up in the grades and they   re not going to get  disillusioned. They   re not going to feel dumb. They   re not going to be  lost as much.  Any disappointments? Tried to pass something and just couldn   t?  Well yes, yes. I had been made aware through constituents in my own  district about the problem we have here in Oklahoma. We   re second in  the nation for grandparents raising their grandchildren. And they need  help. They need financial help and I   ve told them,    I   m a limited  government person and I can   t really in good conscience go out and try  to get a bill passed that   s going to give you money. But you need to  know there are already state agencies and services out there that can help  grandparents.    They don   t know what they are. So they need to know  what they are. So I   ve tried to get a bill passed the last two years that  would give grandparents a little more standing in the courts, because  right now they don   t have hardly any. And that would require agencies  that handle any kind of funds or any kind of programs that grandparents  could benefit from to be used for their grandchildren   for those  13  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  agencies to have to make that information known some way. And both  times the bill has passed the House and the Senate hasn   t even taken it  up. So that has been a disappointment because it   s a great need in  Oklahoma and across the nation.  And are you bringing it forward again?  Well, I very well may.  Do you have a role model or mentor?  The lady that my husband introduced me to who is definitely a role  model for me and has been my mentor is Kay Dudley, who was a State  Senator and Governor Keating   s Appointment Secretary.  She   s on my list.  She definitely is a mentor and a model, a fine Christian lady and just a  sweetheart. You know, not being an individual who was a political  insider, I guess you could want to say like that. I can   t really name  anybody that   s in politics on a state level or federal level.  Do you have a political philosophy?  Do I have a political philosophy? Yes. I   m a strict constructionalist. I  believe that the constitution should be observed. I think that the  constitution is a miracle. No nation has survived as long as we have  survived. We   ve had one constitution in 217-something years. We   ve  been a nation, or the idea of a nation, for a Declaration of Independence  230-something like that. I may not be right on my figures. France has  had what   over fifty constitutions. Peru has had about ten. Our  constitution has stood the test of time because our founding fathers  wrote such a marvelous document that gave power to the people. A  limited government is what they provided and I   m a very limited  government. My philosophy is limited government, government that  represents the people because after all, that   s what our founding  document, our birth certificate which is the Declaration of Independence  says, that we should be a government of the consent of the governed.  And it   s the people   s government and they need to be involved. I believe  governments should not be running the show economically. I   m  definitely for free markets. I   m for the individual having their rights.  Part of my philosophy is that we are a Christian nation. We have  revisionist history today that tries to say we weren   t, that our founding  fathers were deists. But one of the things I did when I was teaching, I  tried to challenge my students,    You go find the primary sources of our  14  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  founding fathers and read what they had to say.    And they would come  back and say,    You know, they didn   t have a problem with God or the  separation of church and state.    Because you can read the diaries of  George Washington. You can even read the two most ungodly ones that  people try to cite, which is Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin. And you  will find references to God and specifically to Jesus Christ. So they  make some modern-day Christians look like we aren   t even Christians  because they did have a belief.  So my philosophy is real freedom comes when the individual has the  right to make the vast majority of decisions for themselves. Government  does have a place, yes, because you   ve got to have a way to tie the  people together for the common good. And the people should always  have the say-so to change things if they disagree. So my philosophy is  very limited government, for the individual, free markets, for the  family   that   s the founding establishment, I guess you could say, for  our whole society. Not just America but the whole society.  What committees are you a member of?  Well, when I was first selected I was the Vice Chairman of the  Appropriations and Budget sub-committee on Education. And then I was  on Health and Human Services and Small Business and Economic  Development. This    06 term, I am the chairman of the sub-committee on  Social Services. I   m on Common-Ed, Education and by virtue of being  the chairman of the sub-committee of Social Services, that puts me on  the full committee that is over Social Services with is Human Services.  So you must have to get up at four o   clock in the morning to get all this  done.  Well, I try not to get up any earlier than I have to. I   ve learned  something the first two years in office. I tried to go to everything.  Sometimes there would be two or three breakfasts in the morning,  maybe as early as 7, 7:30, 8. And some of them might be here in the  Capitol and some would be elsewhere and I would try to get up and go  to all of them. Usually we would have lunches here in the Capitol and  then there would be a reception, sometimes two and three receptions and  then a dinner. And I went to everything because I felt like I needed to  get to know everybody. But by my third session no longer did I get up to  go to breakfasts, unless it was just a really particular organization that I  really wanted to go to. Because I needed my rest, to be honest with you.  And then I cut out a lot of the receptions and a few of the dinners. And  now that I   m a grandmother, my grandson is three months old, when  session starts up again if I try to do things the way I   ve done them, even  with cutting out last session, I won   t get to see him except on the  15  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  weekends, and that   s not acceptable. (Laughs) So I   ll cut out more.  You live close enough to live at home     Yes I do, I live about ten miles from the Capitol.  That   s not bad. Not like some that have to drive     You know, they have my admiration those that live out in the state and  come in and leave their family for a whole week. And then those that  have small children. I just don   t know if I could have done it. I   m  thankful the Lord didn   t lead me to do this at that time in my life.  Kind of figure that   s why more women don   t do it?  I think that   s probably why.  Would you encourage other women to go into politics? And what would  you tell them if they did?  Well, I would if they have an interest and I would if they have one-hundred  percent cooperation and approval of their husbands. Because  this can be hard on a marriage. Fortunately, my husband , being a  minister, was always gone a lot at nights, out visiting and meetings and  things like that, so you know, we just grew up like that. And of course, I  guess it   s just our personalities. I   m a pretty independent person. I   m not  one of these people that I have to have my husband around me all the  time. And he   s not the kind of man that has to have his wife around him  all the time. We have a date every Friday night, we   re very close, we  talk a lot. We   re very secure in our marriage. But even for people who  are secure in their marriage, it can be hard on a marriage because there  are a lot of times that you don   t see your spouse very often. Especially  when we   re in session, you know. You have to make that a high priority.  You have to have a husband who acknowledges that and accepts that  and doesn   t feel threatened in any way. And who is willing to be a part.  If my dear husband had not supported me and helped me and I mean, he  stood on street corners the day of the election, held signs and had a sign  in the back of his car. I mean, oh man, I could never have been here  without his help. And so I would say if you have an interest to run, make  sure your husband is one-hundred percent on board and try to make him  as aware as you can of what it   s going to be like because you   re not  going to see him much.  You   re not going to cook much either.  16  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Oh, cooking, what   s that? (Laughs) Or clean.  That could be a concern for some of them I   m sure.  Well my husband is very good about that. Matter of fact he was actually  a cook in the Marines. He   s probably a better cook   or as good a cook  as me. So he has no problem and we don   t mind eating out, just the two  of us.  Some of the women I   ve interviewed said they   ve lost weight while they  were campaigning and then they gained it once they were in office     Exactly, that is so true. Well you meet and eat, you sit and eat. Kind of  like the joke   kind of like the Baptist church we meet and eat and take  an offering. Here we just don   t take an offering.  Do you have a favorite campaign story? Anything that made you stop or  laugh?  Oh gosh.  Dog bites?  Oh, well I only had one of those. I   m very afraid of those. I   ve been  attacked five times already.  Campaigning?  No, no, growing up. I used to be a jogger and I had a couple of  experiences there. But that was my biggest fear,    Lord, please don   t let  me run into any dogs.    I   m trying to think, since I didn   t have to  campaign the second time. The biggest thing that I remember about  campaigning that people make fun of me about was I seemed to trip all  the time. They really made fun of me about that. Matter of fact, I tripped  one time and injured my shoulder and had to have shoulder surgery. So  they joke about that.  But I guess one thing that   s kind of funny, like I say, I hadn   t planned on  running for politics and when we moved here, I didn   t mention this. Just  so happened the home that we ended up buying is the home of my  predecessor. He was moving farther out into the district. And so when I  was running, one of the things that I would always say when I spoke or  knocked on doors was,    You know my predecessor was Bill Graves.     And so I would say,    You know I moved into one house of Bill Graves  and I would just like to move into his other house.    And people got a  kick out of that.  17  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Did you have a campaign slogan?  Yes, I did. And I have to give up front credit to my wonderful husband.     Vote KERN-servative    And I would have    Vote    and then    Kern    was  in all capital letters, red I think and then       servative    I think was smaller  letters in blue. And I   ve had a lot of people tell me that it was really  catchy. In fact, I do remember one night I was knocking on doors, and it  was on 36th street and a young lady came and I was talking with her and  she said,    You know, I just want to say this. I   m in PR work and I want  you to know that your slogan    Vote KERN-servative    is fantastic  because it ties a person and an idea together. She said that was really  good.     Did you tell your husband?  Oh yeah, I told my husband that. And he gets all the credit for that. I was  going to have    Rally Around Sally,    you know. (Laughs) My son says  that   s too cheesy.  If you have a campaign sign left, we   ll add it to our collection.  I do have some.  So other than the late nights, has anything else changed in your life  because you come to work in this office?  Well, I think I   ve become a little bolder. I mean, I know what I believe  and I   m not afraid to stand up for my beliefs. I think I   ve become a little  bolder in doing that. One of the things that I feel very strongly about     when somebody comes in and wants to talk to me about something, an  issue, or when a lobbyist comes in, one of the things that my friend Kay  Dudley said to me that I try to operate by is,    Be slow to commit.     When, say, a lobbyist comes in and gives me their side of the story I   ll  listen but I don   t commit myself. Here comes the next lobbyist for the  other side, I   ll listen but I won   t commit myself. And I try to really  weigh the two and then know where I stand and then tell them. I   m not  going to let somebody come in here to my office and try to persuade me  into something. If it   s not what I believe, if it   s not what I feel  comfortable about, I   m going to tell them so. I think I owe them that. I  think I owe my constituents that.  One of the things   I   m just amazed at all the parallels between being a  minister   s wife and being an elected official. Don   t ask me what they  are, unless something happens I can   t think of them. We   ve only been at  three churches but I would tell the people, usually they would have a  women   s meeting where the prospective pastor   s wife could meet them,  18  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum     Look, what you see is what you get. I just try to be me, if you like me,  great. And if you don   t, you don   t.    And that   s what I try to do here. I  think a lot of problems could be solved if everybody is just honest and  open and right out front. And so I   m not going to try to make you think  one thing when I   m thinking something else. And if you ask me  something and I don   t know, I   m going to tell you that I don   t know.  Like a librarian, I don   t know but I can find out.  You know, I said that a lot when I was teaching.  Did you have to change your wardrobe when you switched from being a  school teacher to this?  Oh yes, I sure did. I had to go out and buy some dress suits. And I   ve got  to lose weight so I can get in them. (Laughs) Because you do gain  weight. And I   ve got a few that I still can   t get into. So I   m still working  on that. Yes I did. I got more pant suits too, nice pant suits because when  I was teaching most of the time I wore slacks and a jacket or a nice  blouse or something and nice shoes. Occasionally, at least once a week, I  would try to wear a dress or a skirt because my philosophy there was  I   m the teacher, they   re the students. I need to look like the teacher, not  like one of them. So I did have to upgrade my wardrobe.  I   ve been told the chambers are cold.  Oh the chambers are freezing. As a matter of fact, I have an afghan that I  take in there to use. We could save the state a lot of money if we would  turn up the AC.  Have you gotten to travel much?  I have. And I   ve traveled more than I thought I would. I don   t travel on  the taxpayer   s money. I have one time which the Speaker Hyde asked  me and Ann Coody to go to a Southern Regional Education Board  meeting. And that was on the tax dollar. When I go to the National  Conference of State Legislators    meeting, I get reimbursed. If you use  your campaign funds, you get reimbursed or you pay your own way. But  there   s a little more traveling than I thought. I   m pretty picky about what  I go to because I don   t like to go to every meeting. I like to be at home  for one thing, but there are some meetings I will try not to miss because  I think they are very educational for me as a legislator.  So after you finish up your term limit, what do you envision yourself  doing?  19  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Well, if I get to serve out twelve years I will be seventy years old. So  I   m not going to do anything. (Laughs)  Fair enough.  I   m going to take care of grandbabies, watch grandbabies, of course  work in my church. I hope I   m still able to play golf then. I   m sure that I  will try to be involved through Republican Women   s Club or something  like that. But I have no plans to lobby or to find some other positions.  Want to share what your handicap is?  Well, not as low as I   d like it to be. I have about a 25-26 handicap. So  you know, I hit around 100. It   s been a long time since I   ve broken 110.  Before I hurt my shoulder and when I am playing regularly I can usually  break 100. And I   m happy with that. My goal was to break 90, but  running for office is hard on your golf game.  How often do you get to play?  Not as often as I like. I haven   t played in two weeks. Actually I didn   t  even play two weeks. We went on vacation and we played golf so that  was the first of September. So I haven   t played in about a month. If I can  hit under 100, I   m pleased as punch. I just love being out there. I   ve  always been a very competitive person who played sports growing up.  So before I started coaching girl   s golf I would get frustrated on the  course when I didn   t hit a shot I thought I hit. But when I started  coaching golf, you have to teach the girls the most important shot is the  one you are about to make. If you messed up on the one before, you   ve  just got to forget it. You   ve got to play controlled. And that helped me a  whole lot. And my game has been better.  How has the media responded to you or is that something you had to  learn to adjust to?  Yes, yes. I think being a school teacher where I talked in front of people,  even though it   s been students, has helped me. I have a couple of, well  one   I won   t say her name, but she   s just petrified to speak on the floor.  But I think she does a good job. I   m not petrified to speak and I think  that comes from teaching school. As far as the media, I would much  prefer to be behind the camera. I don   t care to ever be on the camera.  But there have been occasions where I have been. I   ve learned to be very  brief, short sentences, because then they can   t splice here and here and  make it look like you are saying something you aren   t saying.  You have to be thinking constantly.  20  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  You do, you do. And so it   s okay. It   s way down on the bottom of my  list of favorite things. I   m really surprised. There   s one issue you haven   t  asked me about?  Well go to it, then.  That   s the library issue. And that   s kind of a funny story, I think it   s  funny. When I was knocking on doors I told people when I was  campaigning, I just told them up front as a matter of fact my spiel was,     Hello, I   m Sally Kern I   m running for State Representative District 84.  Bill Graves is term limited out, that   s why he   s not running. I want you  to know that I   m running as a decidedly Christian candidate because I  believe we are in a cultural war for the very existence of our Judeo-  Christian values and if you agree with me, I would love to have your  vote. And if you don   t, I   m not the person you want.    That   s what I   d  say. I still have got it down. I had no problem saying that because when I  first started I didn   t care whether I won or lost. Actually, I didn   t care if I  won because I just would keep on teaching. So that   s just what I said.  Well, I got elected. The very first of March, when session started in  February   the very first of March, I get this phone call from a young  constituent who said,    Representative Kern, I remember what you said  when you came to my door. How you were running as a Christian  candidate. I have an issue I want to share with you.    She shared about  her daughter going and getting this book. And I promise you   at that  time, we had different desks and my desk was over there. And you   re  probably not old enough to remember the cartoon Little Lulu where the  devil is on one shoulder and the angel on the other. Man, that   s what I  thought of that day. It   s like on one shoulder the angel was saying, the  Lord was saying,    This is why I put you here. You   re here to be a values  representative.    On the other shoulder was,    Oh man, you know. I  haven   t even had, I   ve just barely had a month. I don   t want to do  something like this.    Because I knew immediately that it was going to be  a confrontational issue. But I knew without a doubt that   s why I   m here,  to stand up for values like that, traditional family values. So that led to  going to the local library, in the Metropolitan area. And that led to filing  at the next session, a bill. That particular session, the first session, we  just did a resolution. The next session we did a bill, which I ended up  winning the Mouth of the House award.  Okay, I   ve heard of those.  The only reason I did is because the library bill, the debate on that bill  was something like if I remember correctly, an hour and forty-five  minutes. The other bill that I ran which was controversial, which I firmly  believe in, is the teaching the controversy of evolution. Not teaching  21  Finchum  Kern  creationism, not teaching intelligent design, I don   t want to go there  because I know we   d lose that. But let   s just teach the pros and cons of  evolution, because there are some arguments against it that even the  leading evolutionists say. We teach the pros and cons of everything else.  Even America, we teach what   s wrong with America and we teach about  all these other countries and their forms of government. And that debate  was not quite as long so that   s how I got the Mouth of House award.  I got a lot of media attention from those two things. The thing I learned  is, the media doesn   t really care about the truth. They want a story. The  teaching the controversy bill never once in the paper was portrayed  correctly. It was always portrayed as intelligent design and creationism.  No. I don   t want to do that. Let   s just take what the leading evolutionists  are saying, their doubts, their problems with evolution, and show those  to the kids so that students will know that this is not fact. It   s a theory.  But anyway, I find it interesting. I don   t do it at all anymore. I did do it  every now and then.  You can go on, say Google or Yahoo.com and type in my name and you  get all of this stuff. And of course, it   s all from these real left-wing  homosexual groups and I   m just Hitler, you know. I   m just the worst  thing that there is. And I never once said that I hated them because I  don   t. Matter of fact, when I taught school I had a homosexual teacher  about four or five doors down and the kids would ask me questions. And  I   d say,    You know, that person has the right to choose that lifestyle.  They don   t have the right to force it on you or anybody else.    And that   s  what I believe. I never treated that individual mean or harsh, never  would, never will. Because they are people just like me, that need to be  respected. But that doesn   t mean I have to agree with what they do. But  you know, according to everything that was written, I hated them. No, I  don   t. I don   t hate anybody. So anyway     I   m glad you brought it up. I wasn   t going to push you to     Oh no, it doesn   t bother me. I mean, it   s something that I believe. I think  it   s a big threat. I think the homosexual agenda   and when I say the  homosexual agenda I mean the political aspect of it, where they are  trying to push that lifestyle on Americans to say it is normal and natural,  that is very detrimental to our country. You have to just look at the  statistics. I   m probably getting into more things that you want. Because  it   s a deadly lifestyle. Do we really want that on our children? Plus, too  it   s playing on the natural development of children. When the hormones  haven   t kicked in yet, little girls only want to play with little girls and  little boys only want to play with little boys   normal, natural  development. Let   s don   t pervert that.  22  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Have I missed anything?  Well, I don   t know that you have. I think something that probably isn   t  mentioned a lot that I think is real important up here, is our LAs   legislative assistants . They make us look good. They do a lot more  work than people think. In the Senate they are called EAs   Executive  Assistant, they do the same things. But I tell you, they deserve a lot of  credit because they do a lot of good stuff. They keep us on task. They  answer a lot of constituent things for us. I have a great one and I   m very  thankful that I have her.  Did she come with you?  No, she did not come with me.  Do you get to pick your own?  Yes, you get to hire your own so I chose an individual who had been up  here before. And she ended up only working one session. Her mother is  getting older and she needed to be with her. So, let me see, did I have  somebody else the next year? I can   t remember. Anyway, T.J. has been  with me   no, I think I got T.J. after that. So she   s been with me two  sessions. And she better stay as long as I   m here.  That   s the group we need to interview next. The ones that have been  around fifteen or twenty years.  Oh yes, they know a lot. They are good people, good gals. Most of them  are women, almost all of them, there is a man or two.  Does she do most of your research? Or do you have somebody else that  does it? Research your bills and     She doesn   t usually do that. We have staff that does that. To be honest  with you, I have a couple of people that have said you know, they are  just people who are just average citizens who say,    You know, I really  support you, I really believe in you. I don   t have a lot of money. I   ll help  you any way I can.    And so what I say to them is,    Look, because we  get bills thrown at us so fast, if I have a bill that I would really like some  research on, can I give it to you?    And I   ve got a jewel, she lives in  Tulsa and she   s a jewel, really very helpful. I just had another one not  too long ago come up and say that, who   s worked for somebody on the  federal level, and so I think she would do a good job. So she   s going to  help me.  Not a one man job, is it?  23  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  Kern  Finchum  No it   s not.  One woman job.  One man, one woman, no. I guess I   ll close with this unless you want to  ask me something else. When I   m driving up, and I generally come up  Lincoln here, and I see this dome, this Capitol, I promise you, there   s  very few days that I don   t say this. I look at this dome and just thank  God for the opportunity to be here. And I say    It   s not about me and not  I but Christ.    I mean, that   s who I am. That   s my motivation. And you  know, I   ve had somebody say to me,    This isn   t Sunday school, it isn   t  church, it can   t operate like that.    And what I say to them,    I know it   s  not Sunday school, I know it   s not Church. But I believe the Bible and  the Bible is a book of principles and it operates anywhere and everything  and I   m going to try the best that I can to live by biblical principles.  Does that mean I always follow them and apply them correctly to  everything? No. But my intent is to try to do that.    And so it   s not about  me. And for me, that   s real important because Lord Acton, many years  ago in England, said,    Absolute power absolutely corrupts.    And when  you are an elected official, you have power. You have a place of  prestige, status, influence and I believe that all of us need to make sure  that we remember, it   s not about us, it   s about the people who elected us.  It   s about serving them and keeping our eyes on them and not thinking  that we are something really important.  Somebody said this right after we were elected. It   s so meaningful. They  said,    Being an elected official is like putting on a nice coat. As long as  you   ve got that coat on you are special. There   s going to come a time  though, you   re not going to be an elected official anymore and the coat  is going to come off and nobody   s going to care. You   re just plain old  Sally again.    So why be puffed up from wearing the coat? Just as  humbly as I can, I try to do the job. Now do I have to have people at  times tell me, Hey, you need to watch? Yes. And I   ve got a few people,  I   ve told them,    Look, if you think that I   m getting too big for my  breeches, I want to know it.     Okay, what   s your last question?  My last question is when history is written about you, what would you  like for it to say?  When history is written about me, what would I like it to say? I would  like it to say,    She   s a woman who loved the Lord, who tried serving  and as best as she knew how stood up for what He wanted her to do.     You are doing just that, right?  24  Kern  Finchum  Kern  I   m trying. I   m a sinner saved by grace. I   m going to make mistakes.  When I do, I want to be big enough or humble enough to say I made a  mistake. Because scripture says,    if you cover over your mistakes you   re  not going to prosper.    And at the end of the day, when I put my head on  that pillow I want to be able to go to sleep because I have peace.  Well I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me. It   s been a  pleasure.  Well thanks very much. Thanks for being patient.  ------- -------
