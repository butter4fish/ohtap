Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Today is May 31, 2007. I   m in the Oklahoma County Courthouse in  Oklahoma City, and my name   s Tanya Finchum. This is the project for  the Oklahoma State University Library called Women of the Oklahoma  Legislature, and I   m with the Honorable Twyla Mason Gray who was in  the House of Representatives 1980-84. Right?  Yes, Ma   am.  Welcome. I   m so glad you were able to let us talk with you today.  It   s my pleasure.  Okay, first tell us a little bit about your childhood, where you were born,  about your youth.  I was born in Tulsa. My parents were both born and raised in  southwestern Oklahoma, and my dad went to OSU  Oklahoma State  University . He was the first member of his family to go to college, and  after he graduated he went to work for the IRS in Tulsa. I was the  middle child of three, and Tulsa was a great place to grow up. I have lots  of happy childhood memories and I think, like a lot of people my age,  you know, we were able to go out in the morning and pretty much play  hard all day and our moms were home when we got home. I went to  public schools. I had a physical disability that became an issue early in  my life. I had a deformity in both of my knees. That really impacted my  life because there were a lot of physical things that I could not do. I also  had surgery a number of times as a child, and so I began to read. The  week after school would be out, I   d have surgery again and I   d be lying  around for a great deal of the summer and I would read a pile of books,  and I lived through those books. I traveled and had experiences, and I  think it had a huge impact on my life.  5  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  My father was very involved in politics in Tulsa and across the state, and  so I grew up tagging along to political events and knew candidates and  knew people who were in elected office. I also worked in a whole lot of  campaigns. In 1976, I worked in a particular campaign when James R.  Jones was running for re-election to Congress. I had worked in his  earlier campaigns, but after the    76 election, I went to work for him in  his office in Tulsa, and I really did that for about a year and a half. Then  I decided to run in 1980 and, in part, I ran because I knew a lot of people  in the legislature.  I had been over at the legislature. I had seen what they had done. I  realized that there were many people there that didn   t work as hard as I  did, where I had sort of held them in very high esteem. I saw that, as a  group, there were people that were smart and people who were not so  smart, people who worked hard and people who didn   t, people who were  talented and people who weren   t     and I thought,    You know what? I  can do this,    and so in 1980, I ran. I was twenty-five years old when I  filed for office. I turned twenty-six the week before the election, and the  day after I was sworn into office, which would have been in November  of 1980, I had surgery on both my knees again it   s sort of a lifelong deal.  It impacted my election because I couldn   t walk the district.  Shake hands, knocking on doors     Yeah, I had to campaign in a different way, so     Can you explain a little bit about how you did campaign then?  I ran for a House district. I was a registered democrat at the time, and I  ran for a House district that was very large. The census was done in  1980, and in 1981 we would do re-districting. So, I ran for a Senate seat  in population and size and then I got the House seat. It required me to do  a lot of mail. I think probably at that time we may have done nine or ten  different direct mail pieces, which was a ton back in 1980, and it was  expensive. It cost a lot of money to run a campaign. Some districts and  some communities are very historically campaigned by knocking doors  and you just can   t win in those districts unless you knock those doors.  The area that I was running in, which was east Tulsa County, did not  have that kind of a history and was one of the things that I looked at and  evaluated when I decided to run. I thought it was an area that could be  campaigned by direct mail. I also had a series of coffees where we  would go in and we would mail a precinct. Then we would have a coffee  and people could come by and meet you and visit with you. Then I  would send them thank-you notes. We did that in the precincts in my  district. I don   t remember now how many precincts there were. I will tell  you that Sue Tibbs, who   s currently a member of the House from my old  6  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  House district, was a childhood friend, and she had one of the coffees for  me.  Were you the first woman from your district to win?  Oh, yeah. In fact, I was the first democrat.  And what was that like?  Well, it was okay. At that time, the House of Representatives did have a  majority of democrats and I think that there was some appreciation for  the fact that I had taken a seat that was republican, but Tulsa was not  held in high esteem in the Oklahoma legislature. The year that I was  elected in 1980, I think there were five women from Tulsa, Penny  Williams and myself and Helen Arnold and Arlene Baker and Joan  Hastings. There were five of us. And so I was not only very young, I  was from Tulsa County and neither one of those things was particularly  helpful in the House.  Did anyone take you under their wing and kind of shepherd you along?  Not at first. There were people that I knew and trusted. The majority  leader was a guy named Vernon Dunn, and he was from Loco,  Oklahoma, and Vernon was a really tough guy. He   d had a farming  accident. His leg had been caught, I think, in a combine and to save his  life he cut off his own leg and crawled to the farmhouse. He was really a  tough guy, and at the time that I was elected Cleta Deatherage was the  chairman of Appropriations. She and Vernon did not get along and  Vernon really had it in his mind that all young women were going to be  like Cleta. So one of the things that I did was work hard to persuade him  that that was not the case. When you go into a group like that, you have  to find a way to get along with people that you have nothing in common  with. It   s easy to look at people, like Robert Henry, who was very well  educated and very articulate. We had a lot of things in common and we  had a lot of positions in common and I got along with him. But if you  hang out with the people that you get along with, you don   t learn  anything, and so I needed an understanding of people that I had nothing  in common with.  When I first started trying to see Vernon and go by his office, he  wouldn   t see me. What I finally did one day was I noticed his wife in  there, and I sat down and visited with her for a little bit. His wife  stitched and she had stitched   oh, a pillow or a little wall hanging or  something that was in his office   and I love to sew. It   s one of the  things that I developed after I   d had surgery. I knit and I stitch, and I still  do those things, and so what I began to do was to take my needlepoint  7  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  and sit in his office. After I had done that a couple of days and he was  too busy to see me, he walked through and said,    My daughter does that  and my wife does that,    and I said,    Yeah,    you know, and,    I do, too.  It   s a great thing to do while you   re waiting around.    It gave us a  beginning of a conversation and we became friends and there were a lot  of things that Vernon taught me. Ultimately I began to date a member of  the leadership whose name was Charley Gray. He was a member from  Oklahoma County, and taught me a great deal and, of course, we  married in November of     Eighty-one?  Yeah, 1981, so it was a long time ago. I like him even more today than I  did then so I   m really blessed, but Charley taught me a great deal.  I had read in the paper where you had to go through some legal steps  before marrying     Well, the law in Oklahoma at the time had to do with what they called a  Head of Household law. Residency and domicile are two different issues  in the law, but there was some confusion over whether or not when I  married I would lose my residency in my district. Some of the  republicans told me that if I married him they would sue me on the basis  that I had vacated my House seat. So we had to get an attorney general   s  opinion that by marrying I was not giving up my domicile, that I could  choose that, so     And when you ran for re-election, was it an issue again?  What they did was they claimed that I didn   t live in the district   that my  husband had an apartment here and that I lived here all the time. I not  only was re-elected, but it wasn   t true and Charley and I didn   t really  live together full-time until we   d been married about three and a half  years, and then we lived in Tulsa full-time.  That was a historical moment, too, from what I gather from the papers  because it was the first time two incumbent House members had  married.  Yeah.  An issue of interest in time, I would think.  It was very interesting. We had a great time courting, as my husband  would say. He was from southwestern Oklahoma and, in fact, we dated  for a couple of months before another member, a guy named Tommy  8  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Manar who was from Apache, told us that our parents all knew one  another. I went home and found out that indeed our parents did all know  one another, and it was just really peculiar. It   s such a small world.  It was destiny.  I guess.  What was your first day in office like when you were sworn in?  I remember the swearing in as being just a day of great joy. There are a  few days in your life where you have such a surge of happiness, and that  was one of them. I remember the first time that I made a speech on the  House floor. You push these little buttons for recognition, and I  remember holding the microphone and I looked down and my hand is  shaking. I think,    Oh, no,    so I clamp my arm down by my side and I   m  not gonna shake and then my voice begins to shake. I was so nervous,  but you know I was really young to have those experiences and they  were great experiences to have at that age. I think I learned valuable  lessons that have been applied in all areas of my life because on any  given day you had to get along with fifty-one members of the House.  You had to get along with twenty-five members of the Senate, and you  had to get along with the governor   and in politics, friends come and go  and enemies just accumulate.  So you would have an issue, and you   d be working side by side with  somebody that you just really didn   t like, and you had to develop respect  for them in some way in order to be able to work together. Somebody  that you really didn   t think was very smart or very talented. I think  particularly when you   re young and you   re very impatient with people,  and you would see them with their children and you   d think,    They   re a  great parent,    and that   s something you could kind of hang onto. Or  there would be somebody who worked really hard and you   d think,     Wow, you know, they   re very dedicated to this.    People are not one-dimensional,  and so there are people that you come across in life that  you just detest, but you discover that in another realm they really do  wonderful things, and as a judge now, I often tell people,    I do this  professionally. I had to give up my amateur status as a judge.    I   m so  glad that there   s an omnipotent God that knows our hearts and our minds  and our intentions because our view is so narrow, and I think that that   s  one of the big lessons that I learned in the legislature.  Did you present any bills that you worked really hard to get passed and  then they didn   t?  Oh, sure. I don   t even remember what the content of the bill was, but  9  there was an old gnarly guy named Bill Bradley who was the head of  Banks and Banking, and Bill was about 157 at that time and he  introduced me and said, you know,    There   s this little woman from  Tulsa County. We   re gonna let her talk about her bill before we kill it.     Yeah   and of course they did, so there were those kinds of experiences.  One of the lessons that I learned from my husband was that I was not so  much interested in whether my name was on the bill, but on what  happened, and so there were a lot of pieces of legislation that I handled  on the floor or I did the roll calls on because I cared about the topic. I  worked on the bill that allowed for prosecution of spousal rape. People  do things to each other that frankly I had never heard of or thought about  before I went to the legislature. And I worked on a bill that was a,    rape  by instrumentation.    There were lots of bills that I worked on.  One of the things that was the most important to those of us from Tulsa  County was the University Center of Tulsa. Sometimes everybody plays  a small role, but every role is important, and that   s kind of what  happened in that bill. Jim Williamson, who was a House member then  from Tulsa   my husband taught us both how to roll call a bill, and I did  the democrats and Jim did the republicans   and what happened on the  bill was that with Cleta Deatherage representing OU  University of  Oklahoma  and the Speaker of the House, Dan Draper representing OSU   Oklahoma State University , we couldn   t get the bills out of committee.  They made a mistake in the appropriation process and they did not move  the higher education appropriation bill out of the Appropriations  Committee by deadline. The next day I was reading the journal and saw  that it had not come out. Bob Hopkins, was the older statesman of the  Tulsa delegation, and I went running to Bob on the floor and said,    This  bill is still in the committee.    Well, I had called to check to see if the bill  wasn   t out of committee. I had called the chief clerk   s house to see if it  was a mistake and, of course, they went to the chief clerk, who was  Richard Huddleston, and said a mistake had been made. He told Draper,  and Deatherage got up to ask for unanimous consent that the bill be  moved, and Bob Hopkins objected and then the fight was on because we  had taken this roll call to keep the bill in committee until we got the  University Center of Tulsa.  We were able to keep that bill from coming out for four days which was  a big deal when you   re opposed by the Speaker of the House and the  Appropriations chair. They can make a lot of promises and people begin  to fall off, but eventually we got it   but it was hand-to-hand combat  every day. In fact, one of the things that happened because it was close  to the end of session was in the leadership meeting there was a big battle  because my husband, who was on the leadership, had helped us roll call  the bills and had taught us what to do and had coached us about how to  10  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  talk to different people. There were folks who were really mad at him  and they got into a big fight. The leadership didn   t meet the rest of the  year. Their weekly luncheons were cancelled. It was an exciting time.  How early in the morning did you have to get up to prepare for this type  of day?  Early, yeah. I was there early and I was there late. I was not one of the  people who breezed in at 9:00 and left at 4:00. In those days, we didn   t  have the kind of deadlines they do now, which gave us the ability to  throw a potluck dinner and to talk about ideas and to brainstorm and to  share stuff. I went to events and I spent time with people as a way to get  to know them, again because you have to get to know people to get  beyond that picture in a legislative guide.  You said you came in with five other women from Tulsa. Did you form a  support group?  Well, Joan Hastings and Helen Arnold had been there for awhile, but  Arlene and Penny and I all knew each other really well. I don   t know  that we were in any kind of formal sense, but Penny Williams and I were  very close friends and she was there for me a number of times. I had  known Joan for a long time, but we weren   t as personal friends, and  Helen Arnold was absolutely wonderful and gracious to all of us. I think  at that time, I won   t remember everybody, Freddye Williams was there,  and Freddye was just as sweet as she could be, and Dorothy Conaghan.  Did you rent an apartment and live here or did you commute back and  forth from Tulsa?  I rented an apartment to stay here Monday through Thursday, but then I  was back in Tulsa.  Did you share it with any of the women?  No. I had a little efficiency and lived by myself. Actually, Penny and I  lived in the same complex. We weren   t in one another   s apartments  often but I think there was a little sense of security in knowing that we  were there. We all talked to each other a lot and had mutual interests  with education and in the university center. It was a very nice group of  people that were as supportive as they knew how to be. We   re  notoriously independent and notoriously controlling, you know     thinking that if you   re not out there working, the sun just may not shine  today. So in some ways, it   s kind of an odd group, but at the same time  people really did try. My sister was very ill by the second year of my  term. My sister got ill and Charley and I had to postpone our wedding.  11  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  She died in January right after session started, and I remember a number  of women who were quite a bit older than I was who really reached out  to me. It was my first experience with someone close to me dying and,  you know, as you get older you have more of those experiences. I think  that they had a very good understanding of what that was going to be  like and were just very generous.  In the right place at the right time, I guess.  Yeah.  Did you notice any difference in the culture between the men and the  women on the floor and outside of the     Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It   s a huge difference. For a lot of those guys, they  had never worked with women before. If they   d been ranchers or they   d  been farming, they really hadn   t had a lot of contact with women. We  know that people tend to stay with things that they   re familiar and  comfortable with, and so there were men there who thumped the Bible  and who said that they had a biblical entitlement. I   ll never forget a  senator on the spousal rape bill saying that if he didn   t rape his wife,  he   d probably never have sex. We were doing a child support bill and a  guy in the Senate was saying,    Does this mean that, you know, if you  have a one-night stand you   re responsible for the child? I just can   t  imagine that,    and I thought,    You can   t be that ignorant.    But a lot of it  was based on what I clearly believe is misinterpretation of the Bible and  ignorance.  So when people tend to hang out with folks that are just like them,  they   re going to hang out with other guys   and to throw a woman into  that mix, they   re really uncomfortable. In fact, I tell people that first I  was a member, so I got to go to places that members went. Then I was a  girlfriend of Charley Gray, so I got to go to the girlfriend places. Then I  was a wife, and I got to go to the wife places, and that made some of  them very uncomfortable. You know, men say and do things with one  another that they   re not always comfortable doing in front of women and  quite frankly a lot of them were uncomfortable that I would say things to  their wives about what I had seen them doing. I think it   s interesting, and  perhaps we   re not so tolerant of this now, but there was a lot of,    Do as I  say, not as I do.    A lot of the guys who were the biggest religious  thumpers on the floor of the House were also the ones who were the  most unfaithful to their families, and I didn   t have a lot of respect for  that then and I have even less tolerance of it now.  Could you tell if they treated you any different when you were the one  presenting the bill on the floor   ask tougher questions or      12  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  No, because once Charley Gray taught me about roll calling a bill, I  never went to the floor unprepared. I knew where my votes were before  I got up, and one of my best friends in the House was a guy named Jim  Glover who was from Elgin, Oklahoma. Jim was about 6   4    and  weighed about 240 pounds, and we became great friends. I always  enlisted his help. There were times when we couldn   t agree on positions,  but if Glover and some of those guys could help me on bills   if  somebody started to harass me on the floor, they   d just stand up and  move to advance the bill or to cut off debate. That just comes from those  personal relationships. In fact, when I retired, they gave me a little award  that said that I was the only member of the House that Jim Glover was  afraid of. (Laughs) I don   t think that was true, but we were good  friends   good friends.  Where was your office? What floor?  Well, originally my office was on the fourth floor, in part because of my  lousy knees and it was very close to the chambers so I didn   t have to  walk very far. Those marble floors really wreaked havoc with me, and I  spent lots of days with ice bags. Then, let   s see, I officed on five for  awhile and then I officed on three, so I was kind of up and around  everywhere. In 1982, when I was re-elected, my husband retired and  Dan Draper was still Speaker of the House and I got punished for the  University Center of Tulsa and so Dan took my office, and there was a  variety of things that went on. All of my bills got triple assigned. I had  been able to accomplish the split in the leadership, I had Vernon Dunn  and Charley Gray helping me against the Speaker, and it was a big deal  and so there was a change in the Speaker of the House. Jim Barker was  elected, and then everything changed and kind of went back to normal.  That first session I had very little to do because I couldn   t get anything  done, and so I sort of did what I called guerrilla warfare. I didn   t have  anything to do other than to read their bills and to ask irritating  questions, and so that   s pretty much what I did. Then when Jim Barker  was elected Speaker things leveled out and I worked on legislation and  could get my bills out of committee and     He was ousted, wasn   t he?  Yeah, a couple of terms later, yeah   but I was gone by then.  I   m beginning to learn these names.  I bet.  And you chose not to run for re-election the third time, correct?  13  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Correct.  Any particular reasons why?  I wanted to start a family, and I could not do that from Tulsa. I couldn   t  commute and so it was a pretty easy choice for me.  You had other career goals in mind, too, when you decided not to run  again?  You know, I had always wanted to go to law school and so I did, and I  don   t know that I had any specific goals in mind other than I really was  passionate about going to law school, and my husband was very  supportive of that.  Here you are.  Here I am.  Do you have a particular political philosophy or a philosophy of life?  You know, a friend of mine suggested recently that it   s a useful exercise  to write your philosophy of life, so I   ve thought about it a little bit. I  think by nature I   m a very black-and-white person. It is very easy for me  to draw bright lines, and I think more of my life these days includes  seeing the grey, having compassion for yourself as well as for others. I  think that I have been very demanding of myself through the years. I  always want to be able to say,    Yes, I ate all the fiber. I eat five  vegetables a day and I don   t feel any better,    so then you don   t have to  do it anymore, but you do feel better and so you have to say,    Darn, now  I   ve got to really do this.    I think that discipline plays a huge role in life.  There   s a beginning sentence in a book that I just love and it says,    Life  is difficult    and it is   and once you kind of accept that and quit trying to  fight that, then it gets easier.  Would you encourage women to go into politics? And if so, what kind of  advice would you give them?  I would encourage women to do whatever they find rewarding and  valuable. For me, that included politics. It is a life-changing experience.  It is not easily translated into private business   the skills that you learn.  Some are, but some aren   t. In many situations the kind of personal  power that you use in the legislature is inappropriate and overpowering  to people. If you win, it   s a life-changing experience, but it   s also life-changing  if you lose   and I   ve seen a number of people   s lives really  changed by that. I found it to be a very rewarding and very valuable  14  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  experience, so I would certainly encourage women to look at it. I think  that the public has high expectations for women. I think they expect us  to be more ethical and to be more responsible, and to be less influenced  by money and by traditional systems of power or the    good ole    boy     system. I think we have to be careful with the trust that   s been placed in  us.  Did you have any role models, female role models? Barbara Jordan?  Barbara Jordan was somebody that I had great admiration for. I was in  high school when the Watergate hearings were going on, and I can  remember going home and turning on the television and watching the  hearings. She was beautiful and she had this wonderful voice, and as I  was able to read about her life I just thought,    Wow, this is somebody  that I can really admire.    And I had read a lot, Eleanor Roosevelt and  other really powerful women in history, but Barbara Jordan was  somebody that was more tangible to me. I can   t say that there were any  particular women that I knew that were particular role models. There  were pieces that I learned from Penny Williams. There were other things  that I learned from Helen Arnold. There were lots of things that I learned  from men as well and I really did have some great male mentors through  the years. In Tulsa County, there was a guy who was a contemporary of  my father   s, named Tomy Frasier, and Tomy had taken me under his  wing and was very gracious to me through the years. There was also  another guy that was a contemporary of my dad   s   a friend of my dad   s,  Darvin Brown. And all of those guys were really good to me. I think it   s  particularly important, if you can, to mentor other women, and I try to  make myself available to do that. I just didn   t have as much access to  women back then.  You said you had a sister. Was it just the two of you?  No, I had a younger brother, too. My sister passed away, and my  younger brother is a very successful businessman in Dallas, and I laugh  at   he   s been so successful, people are waiting for me to do well.  (Laughs) We   re very close. He   s a great guy. He has two daughters.  Were you the only one that went into politics?  Yes. My brother actively supports candidates and does fundraising and  is interested in politics, but did not choose to run for office, so     May yet.  Could, I guess.  15  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Let   s see. What else haven   t we covered? We could go into what you   ve  been doing since you left office.  Well, I did go to law school, and after that I took over the financial  management of some companies, and did that for a couple of years.  Then I had cancer in 1990. It took me about a year to go through all of  the treatment, and my husband and I decided to move back to Oklahoma  City, so we did that. I did some volunteer work for Legal Aid here, and  then in 1994 I was appointed as a judge for the City of Oklahoma City.  In 1998, I decided to run for office again and I was elected as a district  judge here in Oklahoma County, and I   ve been re-elected twice since  then.  Did your days from the legislature help this time around?  Oh, sure.  With both campaigns?  Oh, sure.  Different type of campaigning?  Oh, very different, because it   s a non-partisan race and, in fact, you   re  prohibited from disclosing your party affiliation which, I think, is right  in a judicial race. I really do think we want to elect people based on their  qualifications, not on their party. It certainly helped that I knew a lot of  people and it helped that my husband had been an elected official in  Oklahoma County. After we moved back here in 1992, he was re-elected  to the legislature and served ten years and left in 2002. We have one  child, and she   s now a senior in college, so we   ve been busy with her  through the years.  My last question then is   unless you have something else you want to  say   is that when history is written about you, what would you like for it  to say?  That I did some good for somebody.  From what I   ve read, you did it and have and will continue to.  Well, thank you.  Is there anything I haven   t covered that we need to? Anything else you  want to say about the gender differences in the     16  Gray  Finchum  Gray  Finchum  Gray  You know, the only other thing that I would say is that I think that a lot  of times men presume that women will be easier to overpower. Bully is  not quite the right term, but when you are a member of a group and  there   s a big divide, maybe a tax increase, and there are people who are  pushing hard on both sides, it is difficult not to succumb to the pressures.  I do remember, I think it was a gasoline tax increase for roads but it was  a big deal, and they called my father to see if he would talk to me about  changing my vote, which really made me mad. The governor called me  down to his office to explain to me what was going to happen, and I  remember really feeling pressured about it   and I can remember getting  up in the morning and kind of getting ready for the office and thinking,     If I give in on this, I will never forgive myself, and I   m not going to do  that,    and it was very hard to do.  In fact, as I recall, my husband voted for the bill and I voted against it  and he didn   t say a word to me about it. Knowing whether you have the  ability to withstand pressure is a very valuable tool. I remember  somebody saying to me one time,    You know, everybody has a price.    I  just don   t know what mine is yet. It   s not about money. We all have  things that we care about so much that we would be pressured about  that. I watched a lot of men that I thought had a lot of backbone and  discovered that I had more backbone than most of them. That   s  disarming to a lot of men. I don   t think it   s quite as socially acceptable  to say those things now as it was twenty-five years ago, but I think it   s  still reality.  Lessons learned.  Yeah.  Well, that   s all I have. Thank you so much for allowing me to speak with  you today.  It   s my pleasure.  ------- -------
