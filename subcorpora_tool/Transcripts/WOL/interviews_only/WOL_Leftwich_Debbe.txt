Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Today is November 30, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m with  the Oklahoma State University Library and we   re doing an oral history  project called Women of the Oklahoma Legislature and today I   m with  Debbe Leftwich. And she was elected to the Senate in 2003     That   s correct.     and is currently serving. So thank you for having us today and you are  District 44, right?  Correct.  Let   s start by having you tell a little about your childhood and then we   ll  work forward. Where you were born and     Well I was born in Lincoln County here in Oklahoma, the county seat  called Chandler but my parents were both from Wellston about eleven  miles away and that   s where I grew up. Again, with both of them  growing up there I think I was quite fortunate to have both sets of  grandparents and lots of aunts, uncles and cousins in a small community.  It was a lot of fun growing up in a small town. We were real big on  sports like most small towns in Oklahoma   particularly basketball back  in those days. I played a lot of sports as a child and in high school, as  well.  There were only thirty-one in my graduating class and years later,  looking back, I think that was really a unique experience to have those  small classes. We got a lot of one-on-one with our teachers. We had an  awful lot of good teachers. I even had a couple who taught my mother.  (Laughs) Which I always thought was kind of funny and one always had  a hard time getting my name right. She would call me my mother   s  name instead, two-thirds of the time. I loved school and my first grade  5  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  teacher, it just so happened, was the sister of an uncle of mine, he had  married one of my aunts. And so she was kind of family and I was the  teacher   s pet and that was pretty cool. Then I had another two or three  teachers in grade school that I just really thought a lot of. One of them  still lives in Wellston and still I see her on occasion when I   m down  there.  Siblings?  I have one brother. He is two years older than me and we   re pretty close,  I   m happy to say, after all these years. (Laughs)  And after high school, you went where to college?  I went to Oklahoma Baptist University (OBU) which is where my  brother was at too. (Laughs) I only went there for three semesters before  our dad had an accident and he was injured and laid off work for about a  year. And so I dropped out of school and went to work.  And how early were you interested in political issues?  Actually, that probably started younger than I can even   I   ve thought  about that question. I   ve been asked that before. I know my real interest  really surged in high school but I probably had a little bit of interest  before that. I can remember teachers in grade school, even, would have  us bring articles from the paper every once in a while, in the fifth and  sixth grade level, and talk about civics, events of the day and that stuff  was just real interesting to me. But it really kind of got its    feet wet, I  guess you call it, in high school my freshman year. I had a teacher that  encouraged me to take speech. And some of the kids in speech class then  were also involved in student government so the next year I ran for  student government and that   s what really got me interested in it.  Did your parents discuss politics around the dinner table?  Absolutely, (Laughs) oh yes. Yes they did.  That helped I guess.  Well it did and I was always interested in what the grown-ups were  talking about.  Do you remember your first election where you got to vote?  Yes I do and I can tell you. You had to be twenty-one years old to vote  back then. That dates me a little. The year that they lowered it to  6  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  eighteen was the year I turned twenty-one and I was so mad because all  those eighteen year olds got to vote and I had to wait. (Laughs) I  remember that real well. I couldn   t wait to vote. I just thought it was one  of the best things in life. I had been involved a little bit in some local  campaigns through people I knew or relatives. One of my best  girlfriends, her uncle ran for county sheriff one year. We would go out  on Saturdays and put up signs and do leaflets in small towns. And back  in those days they would do a little county caravan, they   d call them.  You   d go from town to town because Saturday was a big deal in small  town Oklahoma. Everybody went to town on Saturdays and they would  have little local drawings or a little local something on the town square,  and so everybody would go to town. It was a big, big deal and it was a  good time to campaign. It was a good time to hit those little towns at that  particular time of the day to do your campaign work.  Shake hands and move on to the next one.  Yes, right. Get through there and on to the next town.  Now take us up to the point when you decided to run for this seat.  Well that was a very long journey. I was not involved in student  government in OBU. It wasn   t big in the bible college, back then  anyway. There were no active young political groups. And so I really  didn   t get too involved. I was out of school a couple of years when an  OBU professor I had had a couple of classes with ran for governor. His  name is David Boren. (Laughs) I think just about everybody that went to  OBU during that period did something in his campaign. I mean, there  were so many young people involved in his campaign for governor. It  was such a huge grassroots movement, and again when you couple that  with the fact that there   s so many young people being involved, that was  pretty exciting. I worked on that campaign and after he was elected, my  life kind of took a few other directions and I wasn   t too politically  involved until years later.  I got married shortly after that and then I got divorced shortly after that.  (Laughs) So that kind of took up a lot of time. It wasn   t until I met my  second husband that I got involved in politics again. And it was because  he had ran for office before I met him and he had been involved in  politics since he was a young child. His mother had been an activist and  I think she drove him to every political meeting that she ever went to  and he was her only child, and so he grew up with it far more than I did.  He had been active with Young Democrats at OU  University of  Oklahoma , where he went to college. And he had worked in a lot of  Senate races out in Choctaw and the Del City area   he grew up in  Choctaw. He had run for a House seat once before I met him, like I said.  7  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  When we first met he told me he was going to run for office again, he  just wasn   t sure when. And so it was just a year after we got married, we  hadn   t even been married a year, when he ran for a House seat and he  won that one. That threw both of us in to just being really active in his  campaign.  I got involved with a local democrat women   s club. I got involved with  party. I had never been involved with a party before but I decided I  wanted to do that because I wanted to help him. That really started it. He  was in the legislature and the House for six years, three terms. Then he  decided to run for a statewide office, he ran for Corporation Commission  in 1988 but he lost in the primary run-off election and he worked for the  Del City Chamber for a couple of years. Then he ran for the Senate in  1990 and was elected. And then he passed away in 2003 and that   s when  I decided to run for his Senate seat shortly after his passing.  He served another thirteen years.  Thirteen years. So twenty of the twenty-two years we were married, he  was in politics.  And your fingers were in it too, then.  Absolutely, it was just a way of life in our household.  So how did your first campaign differ from the ones you had helped him  for himself?  First of all, it   s different when you   re the candidate, pure and simple. It   s  just a whole lot different than being a spouse. Secondly, it was a special  election. It was late in the year. It started in October. We only had eight  weeks to run a special election where normally you   re in it for about five  months. So you cram five months into eight weeks.  Not so much     You don   t. It   s very fast-paced. You   ve got a lot of information to get  out in a short period of time to the voters. And special elections are  tough anyway because not that many people turn out on special  elections. You   ve really got to work the voters to get them to turn out to  vote.  So then when you ran for a full session     Well I ran again. I filed last year in 2006 and there was only one  individual that filed against me and he withdrew. So I did not have a  8  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  race last year and no one was more shocked than me.  And happy.  Absolutely, I could go help some friends.  Then you can   t answer   I have some questions about strategies and  slogans. Did you have a slogan in those eight weeks?  In those eight weeks?  Yes. Did you have time?  Not really. Not really. During that kind of period, I know it was a really  sad period for my family and for a lot of supporters of his, too, that  basically   a lot of them knew me. I had been that involved in his  political career. And I think it was just the message I can gave them that  if they trusted me and elected me that I would continue to vote and do  the same things he did, vote the same way and represent that district in  the same manner. And I guess they liked it because they elected me.  (Laughs)  Tell me a little about your campaign sign. I read somewhere where it   s  just a little different from his.  Mine is right behind you. I wanted my sign to be almost identical to his,  but I didn   t want to confuse the voters. Now he always had a theme   he  was the walking candidate. When he ran in    82 when we first got  married, or after we first got married, he put a big footprint on his signs.  A big man   s footprint because he was the walking candidate, that he  knocked every door and believe you me, he did back in those days. It got  a little tougher as we got older, but he walked every door. So that was  his slogan. He was the walking candidate. But that meant that he was  close to the people. He was out in the district and he was, you know,  talking to them at their doors, listening to their concerns and always  available and that was kind of what that symbolized. So what I wanted  to do, he never put his first name on his sign so I put my first name on  the sign and I put a woman   s footprint. Even though eight weeks is not  enough time to walk (Laughs) an entire Senate district but it was just a  symbol that I would remain close to the people in every way that I  possibly could that they were used to and accustomed to and what they  deserved, quite frankly.  And it worked. On election day, tell a little about what you might have  been doing or thinking or     9  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  That was a very emotional day. And it was very cold   it was winter     December 9th and it had snowed that morning. I had volunteers out  waving signs at corners and I was at the corner nearest to my house but  it was so cold we were all bundled up. You couldn   t tell who we were  because of all the layers of clothing and coats and mittens and out  waving signs and waving at voters and just freezing to death. That part  was still kind of fun and exciting even though it was cold. I was  concerned that some of my voters may not turn out because it was  getting pretty slick outside and we had telephone polls running all day  trying to get people out to vote.  We were offering rides out to the polls and that sort of normal things  during the campaign that we always did anyway. Some of them were  saying that we aren   t getting out in this unless it really clears up. Well it  didn   t clear up for awhile. So I knew I had lost some votes due to the  weather. But I remember a little bit later that day, it dawned on me  that   and I knew this but I just hadn   t focused on it in a while   but  because when the Governor had announced what day the election was  going to be held on, shortly after Keith passed away, that was the exact  day we had met in 1980   December 9th.  It was meant to be then, huh?  It was just almost like a little sign or something, if you believe in those  things. But to me that was just so symbolic too that I was elected on the  same day we had met years earlier.  Destiny.  I think so, I really do. I   m part Irish so    (Laughs)  Well do you live close enough where you don   t have to commute a long  distance when session is going?  I live here in the city. Yes, I   m here in Oklahoma City.  Do you remember swearing in day?  Yes I do because my family was up here with me, especially my father  who had never been to the State Capitol ever in his life.  Really? Not till that day?  Not till that day. But he came up and I had him hold the bible while I  was being sworn in by Justice Apollo, who had been a good friend of my  mother-in-law   s   my late husband   s mother. They had known each  10  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  other real well years ago. So that was another bittersweet day.  When you drive in, do you drive in on Lincoln?  I drive down I-235, I get off on 23rd. I love that route and here   s why  because just as you almost top that hill when you get off on that 23rd  Street exit and you just see that dome and you see the Capitol building.  It   s like over the horizon and it   s just kind of unique.  So it starts the day off for a good start.  I think it does.  Describe a typical work day when you get here, during session.  During session? Well that varies depending on what time all the  meetings are starting. Early in the session we   ve got committee meetings  but you   ve got appointments before and after. Typically I   m here  anywhere between eight and nine o   clock, at the latest. Whether I   ve got  a meeting set up here in the office, then the committee meetings start.  You   re just back and forth. You   re in meetings all the time just about     if not with committees, with groups, with individuals about a number of  things, mainly legislation but there are a number of things going on.  Constituents that come up to the Capitol, you want to take time out of  your busy day to go talk to them and greet them and have a photo-op or  whatever. That   s one of the fun parts. And during session   oh the last  couple of years, we all put in some pretty long hours, even when before  we start having much activity on the floor when we   re still basically in  committee meetings. There   s still so many other things we   re doing,  working on legislation, that it   s not unusual for me not to get home  before eight or nine o   clock at night.  More than a forty hour week.  Well it really is. I   ve often kind of joked in a way but it   s really true, if  you   re really out here doing people   s business you   re going to be  clocking in forty hours at least before noon on Thursday. And then on  weekends, on Fridays and Saturdays we are all in our districts going to  meetings with your local civic groups, your chamber groups or church  groups or whatever that have meetings and events that they want you  there for. So it doesn   t stop when you   re not in this office or in that  chamber, not to mention all the calls you a have to return. (Laughs)  Have you had the same assistant the entire time?  11  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Yes, I   ve been very, very fortunate because Jeri  Holland  worked for  my late husband for about six or seven years. So not only does she know  the ropes, she grew up in south Oklahoma City. She graduated from U.S.  Grant so I always say she probably knows more people than I do. In fact,  when I decided to run, I had a little conversation with her I said,    You  know, if I do this and win, I want you to stay or I   m not going to do it.     (Laughs) You know, I wasn   t a dummy.  It   s worked out well, too.  Yes it has.  Do you recall the first day you debated a bill on the floor?  Hmm, the first day I debated a bill   I hope it was on my own. I   d have  to stop and think about that.  Maybe, if you can   t remember that, do you have a memorable  experience of debating a bill on the floor?  Well I know one of the first bills I passed my first session was very  memorable because it was a big, important bill and I was very lucky, I  mean absolutely lucky to be a part of that. It originated in the House,  however, because I had already missed the deadline to file bills when I  was elected so I didn   t have any Senate bills that first year but I got  asked to be Senate author on some House bills. And that particular one  was with Representative Danny Hilliard who had been in the House for  a while. He was in leadership at the time and I had known him of course.  He was working on a cancer bill, his mother had died of breast cancer,  and I had some friends of mine working with the American Cancer  Society on a bill that came and asked me if I would be the Senate author  and of course I jumped on it right away. But I also realized it was a very  big endeavor. That not only was it going to affect women in Oklahoma  who were uninsured, under-insured or uninsured for breast and cervical  cancer treatment, it was going to take some money   some big money.  I certainly wasn   t in the position. I said,    I may have gotten my  husband   s Senate seat but his seniority didn   t transfer to me.    And so  right away I went and enlisted the help of the First Lady. She had come  out and helped me campaign one weekend   which I   ll always treasure  that time with her and be grateful to her. And I went to her about it  because I found out we were the only state in the nation that was not  participating in a federal matching program that we could get federal  money. In fact it was a four to one match and boy, her eyes lit up like  mine did   a four to one match, how come we   re not doing this? And we  got it done through her efforts. It was on the Governor   s agenda and we  12  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  got that bill through that year and we got that program started in the year  2005. That was huge for me, especially being a freshman legislator. And  that was pretty exciting, and I   ve since been on the advisory council that  oversees that and the Health Department   the screening and the   I  chair it now   screening and the treatment. That program is just going  great. There   s many more women than we thought we   d be serving in  Oklahoma and it   s just a wonderful feeling to be a part of that.  Sure. What other committees are you on?  Well right now? Because it   s changed since I started, a little bit.  Well what were you on?  I co-chair Business and Labor and I was chairing Business and Labor  before we had the split in the Senate so I co-chair it now. But I co-chair  with a very good friend of mine, who was my vice-chair before so that  committee gets along real well. (Laughs) So I co-chair that committee  and then I   m also on the Human Resources, which is Health and Human  Resources Committee and I   m on Transportation and I   m also on the  Public Safety Sub-Committee, Sub-Appropriation Committee and I   m  on Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, which is a relatively new one that  they created last year. That   s a lot to keep you busy.  When you hold public office, you do get asked to serve as members of  boards and commission type things. So I   ve gotten involved with a  group called Skill which helps children that are in high school that for a  number of reasons are living independently. We help them live  independently and we help them finish high school and try to get them  into college or Vo-tech or something like that. And then I   m on the  advisory council for the Breast Cervical Cancer Committee. I   m on two  or three other committees like that that may or may not be directly  related to state government but it   s a role that legislators do play. And  that takes up a lot of other time too but it   s important work. You just  kind of have to be asked to do that kind of thing.  I got asked recently to work on a YMCA board that I   ve helped them  with. They do an annual retreat at the Capitol. They bring kids to the city  from all around the state, juniors and seniors in high school. They come  up here and have a mock session in the House and Senate and they pass  legislation and stuff. I   ve been hosting them ever since I   ve been up here  and so they asked me to be on their board now, which I think is a neat  deal. I   ve always been at the breakfast they have every year during that  time where they have a panel of legislators. We actually talk to them  about some of their legislation questions or if they are wanting to  propose legislation, get our take on it. We get their take on some bills  13  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  we   ve passed and it   s a really fun exchange because these are really  bright kids. I just really have fun with that.  What can you see yourself doing after your twelve years, after you   ve  termed out?  At my age, retiring. (Laughs)  I don   t know     I don   t know, I   ve thought about that and I   m honestly not 100  sure  what I   ll be doing. I think that more than likely I   m still going to be  involved in something political. I love working campaigns. I think that   s  probably the old athlete in me   the competitive edge, the  competitiveness of the campaign. I   ve worked a lot of other people   s  campaigns and I think I   d probably still do that to some degree, whether  it   s actual managing or consulting or advising or something like that. I  probably will still be involved in campaign work.  Consulting on campaign work.  Consulting, yes.  Do you have a mentor? Since you were elected?  Maybe not since I was elected but I   ve had at least a couple of mentors.  That   s okay. Do both if you want.  Well I had a high school teacher that was my mentor who got me  involved in student government and through speech class and debate and  stuff like that. I had a mentor who was a retired teacher that was a  mentor as far as some of the work I was doing with the party at the time,  with the democrat women. I was state president for a few years and she  had been state president. She   d been state president of the retired  teachers, too. So she just knew everybody, I swear, this lady was  phenomenal. I really adored her. She   s been gone for some time now.  And since I   ve been here, that   s one thing I think women are a little  short of, role models because let   s face it, we don   t have many women in  the legislature. We   ve got a few more just since when I came in, but as  far as Senate, we still just have a handful   six.  Six. And there   s nineteen total, I think.  Right. I think we had twenty-two last year and the year before. So   but  before that, it was down in the single digits. There   s still a lot of women  14  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  in our state   s history, I think, we can draw back on that were trailblazers  and     Any of those come to mind?  Oh, well I was even talking about one   we went to Guthrie a couple of  weeks ago for the centennial. To me that was a very moving day being  part of our state   s centennial and being one of the few women in the  legislature taking that train to Guthrie and all that and being in that  special session they had up there that day. And one of the reporters  asked me about the significance of being a woman. I said,    Well gosh,  when Oklahoma became a state, women couldn   t even vote.    (Laughs)     And here we are in the legislature. We can still use a few more.    One of  the gentlemen that was standing nearby said,    And do you know who  that lady was?    I knew he knew and he was just seeing if I knew and I  said,    Yes, that was Kate Barnard.    I made the comment rather about we  already had one woman who had been elected before women could even  vote. And that was Kate Barnard so     The statue is downstairs.  Yes the statue is downstairs by the south entrance. There   s a really neat  history about her time in office too. If you haven   t read it, you need to  read it, it   s really good.  And the first Senator  U.S. , was Alice Robertson.  Right.  And Mrs. Lamar Looney.  Mm-hmm, Lamar Looney.  And then there was a gap for a considerable number of years.  A considerable gap, yes here that was back in the    20s.  And then in the    60s     There was one lady in the Senate, or maybe it was the House   Betsy   Bessie McColgin     first woman to serve in the House  somebody. Her  picture is out here in the hallway. I can   t think of her last name. But she  is a relative I think of Glenn Coffee   Senator Glenn Coffee   s wife, if I  remember correctly.  So in your freshman class, were there any other women?  15  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Well I don   t really have a freshman class. Although I was the third  special election that year so we three kind of have our own little class.  (Laughs)  Two men or other women?  Two men.  Can you talk about any other gender differences you   ve noticed, if there  are any?  I think there are. I   ll be very blunt. I think we still probably exist in  the   it   s just not relevant to the Senate or the House or legislature in  general. I mean, I can draw a list from working as an administrator in the  state agency or an administrator in a private company. Before that, that  there   s still the boys club   the inner circles that are pretty much still the  boys club. That   s not going to change until we have a woman Governor  or a woman Pro-Tempore or a woman Speaker.  And more women period.  And more women period. (Laughs) That   s not going to happen unless  you have more women. It   s just not. There   s been a few times, though,  I   ve felt that women weren   t taken as seriously up here because of  gender. Because there are still some that don   t think women should be in  office. It   s hard to believe in this century that there are, but there   s still  some with that sentiment that does exist. Doing personnel work like I  did for years, I   ve studied people. You know, they can say all day what  they want to, their actions tell me a lot more. (Laughs)  Do women tend to group together and have a women   s club then?  Well, you know, we really didn   t when I was first out here. And then a  couple of years ago I decided to help organize a women   s caucus. We  started to have enough to have a little caucus to maybe do a few things  that or help each other, support each other when we can. Having partisan  differences at some times might not allow that but there are a number of  things that we can help each other on. So we formed a women   s caucus  and we didn   t do much this last session but I   ve got some plans for them  this year.  It was so funny, I remember when we had one of our first meetings, it  got all of the guy   s attention   what are they up to, you know? In fact,  when I noticed that a couple of times that session, I did this just for the  heck of it. We went and had a meeting scheduled but I would announce  it on the floor. You know, during session they have time for  16  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  announcements and I would announce,    Women   s caucus is meeting in  whatever room.    And we   d just go stand in there and laugh and giggle  because we knew they were just,    What are they up to now?    (Laughs)  One of the gentlemen over in the House commented   one House  member said,    Well maybe we should just create a men   s caucus too.    I  said,    You   ve had one for almost 100 years.    (Laughs)  And how did he respond to that?  He just stopped and said,    Well.    But it was true. (Laughs)  One of the things that some women have said is that the chamber   s  temperature is set for men instead of women and they freeze.  Mm-hmm.  They have too many layers and suits.  Right. Well that   s why I   ve started wearing more pant suits, myself,  because it does get chilly out there. It does.  What advice would you have for a female that   s considering running for  office?  What advice? I always tell them   well actually, I would probably give  them much of the same advice I would give a male candidate, to some  degree. Because first of all, don   t do this unless it   s something you really  want to do. Don   t let people talk you into it for their reasons. Do this  because it   s something you really want to do. If you   ve got a genuine  interest and you have a genuine desire to serve the people, that   because  I don   t think you can be as effective if you   re not. And that you   ve also  got to sit down and discuss with your immediate family the impact it   s  going to have. I do some kind of reality check with my candidates I  work with and I tell them,    During the campaign season, you know,  you   re not going to be home very much.    And you   ve got to sit down  with your spouse and say,    Now while I   m doing campaign work,  someone   s got to fill in the slack of whatever I do at home   whether it   s  with the kids or different duties, chores or whatever.    You   ve really got  to realize that   that that person is going to be gone a lot during  campaign season because they   ve got to be out meeting voters and  raising money.  And that   s another thing, you   ve got to not be bashful about asking for  money. That   s one of the things that I hear from men and women  candidates that is hard for them, but I think particularly for women  because there   s just not that many of us but you   ve got to be willing to  17  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  ask for money. They are more than likely going to give to the candidates  than someone else asking. You   ve got to learn how to close deals. And  when I say close deals, I mean get that person   s commitment   will you  support me? A simple yes or no, and maybe I   ll get back to you but  you   ll learn how to close those deals. You need to get people to know  that I   m serious about this and this is what I   m going to do.  Is there any training out there for that sort of thing?  There are some candidate workshops that some people put on  sometimes. I even put one on one year through the party, so there   s  different venues to learn some of that but there   s absolutely nothing that  will replace hands-on experience. I like having, especially if someone is  new interested, come work in a campaign, see what it   s really like. If I  can   t get you involved in one that I   m involved in then I want to  introduce you to someone else. Just get involved and do it yourself.  There   s just no better experience whatsoever, to get in and work with  someone or with a group of people who have done this before.  What was your biggest challenge?  Money is the biggest challenge, I still believe, for women. I really do.  It   s not that some of the contributors don   t take us as serious, it   s just a  lot of them are hedging their bets on who is going to win. Everybody  wants to support a winner and they   re not so sure the women candidates  out there are going to win. But I   m encouraged at this particular time in  our history that I   ve seen more interest in female candidates, even since I  ran. I think that   s about to change. I think the public is   overall, it   s just  generally more interested in   I   m talking a more local races, probably  more because that   s the more that I   m personally involved in. But I see  them being so much more receptive to women candidates.  And so we   ve just got to find women candidates that want to be willing  to put that time and effort into it. It   s hard, too, to struggle the family  life. If you   re young and you   ve got children, I   m not sure I would have  wanted to do this when my kids were little. That   s got to be one of the  worst things. You know, it was hard enough having my husband do it  and I was home alone a lot with them. But you know, unless one of the  parents is there filling this role, that   s going to be very, very hard. We   ve  got a lot of single mothers in this day and age so unless they   ve got a  family support group somehow, that   s a tough call.  And then you get down to the geography aspect of it too. If they   re in  Tulsa and     Yes, but even your rural communities are worse that Oklahoma City or  18  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Tulsa. We   re more compact, our districts are right here, where out in  rural Oklahoma, they are spread out everywhere. They could go over  three or four counties. So that   s something to consider also.  Were you the first woman to hold your district   s seat?  No, I   m the second. Kay Dudley was the first one. Senator Kay  Dudley   she replaced Marvin York back in 1986.  Twenty-seven years though in between.  Yes, she was the one my husband beat in 1990. (Laughs)  I suppose you   re friends with her or at least cordial.  Yes, absolutely. And one of the representatives that came after him in  his House seat   it was House District 91   was Alice Musser. She had  that seat for one or two terms, I think. So there have been a couple of  other women out in that part of town.  I haven   t interviewed either one of those yet.  Oh well you   re going to love them. They   re both darling gals. And  sharp, oh let me tell you. Of course, Kay served as Governor Keating   s  appointment secretary when he was governor. Alice has been real  involved with senior groups and other activities. She still remains active.  That   s nice that you   re aware of some of the other ones that came before  you.  Oh, absolutely. Well of course when my husband was first elected to the  House, he was seatmates with Freddye Williams who was a  representative from northeast Oklahoma City. A great gal   she was the  one who pushed through the mammograms being covered by insurance  companies. I remember that battle way back in the late eighties. I had  gotten to know her pretty well back then, too. Of course, Angela  Monson who served in the House and the Senate, I did get to serve with  her for at least a couple of years.  Do you stay in touch with them?  I still see Angela every once in a while. Of course Freddye   s gone.  And what about social networks   once you get out, some stay friends  and some don   t, just like anything else.  19  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Yes.  Are there any other special issues you want to go over or anything that   s  happened?  Yes, why not? (Laughs)  Go to it.  You can all read about someday what I did accomplish. Of course, when  I first came up here my first goal was to finish some things that my  husband wanted to finish his last term. He had just gotten reelected in  2002 before he became ill. And so one of the programs that took me two  sessions to complete was the graduated driver   s license for teenagers. He  had worked on that for a couple of years so I worked on that pretty hard  and we got that done. The other one is a trucking bill that he had and this  is one I had a hard time following. (Laughs) So I at least got some other  senators involved in it and we were able to get that done. It was to help  get kind of a one-stop shop for truckers to get licenses and other things  in one agency instead of spread out over two or three, which was just  costly and time consuming. So they did get that done. Another group did  that.  A couple that I haven   t finished yet, is on driver   s license programs in  public schools. We had them for years and now we   ve quit having them,  then they started coming back and then they   re gone again. And that   s  because of the money and the driver   s license education fund. I   m going  to try to work on that again this year because it   s a reimbursement  program. If schools don   t get reimbursed sufficiently, they   re not going  to carry the program, pure and simple. So I   m going to look at that.  Another one that I   ve started that Keith did work on some was trying to  create a aging department to consolidate all of senior   s services because  right now they   re spread out over six or seven agencies. That just  doesn   t make any sense to me. This is something very high on senior  groups lists   your area-wide aging, your silver-haired legislature and  other senior groups, AARP, this is pretty high on their list. And so I   ve  had that bill up there for a couple of years and I   m still working on it. I  think we   re going to see a little movement on it this year, I really do.  We   ve got some additional groups involved and interested and some  more legislators interested in it too.  Another one is domestic violence. I   ve got a real passion for domestic  violence as far as trying to do something about it in Oklahoma. It just  gets me that it   s still a misdemeanor for a first-time offense. And if  anyone knows anything about domestic violence, you know it   s  happened more than once before it ever gets to court, before there are  20  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  ever charges filed. It is a violent crime, first and foremost   and yet we  are not making that first-offense a felony. But yet we   re filling up our  prisons with all these non-violent offenders. I have a real problem with  that. One of the scenarios I use is in Oklahoma it   s a felony to own a  fighting rooster or fight dogs but it   s a misdemeanor to hit your wife.  I am hoping in the time I   m here, that Oklahoma is going to stand up and  say,    Enough is enough.    That    We   re not having any tolerance for  domestic violence.    And help me push that through the legislature and  get that done. In addition to that, it   s important to also give some  economic security to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  That   s another bill that I   ve been working on.  They can leave if they choose to?  Yes, and they can not be afraid to take off work and do things they need  to do like go to court and relocate and other things like that. A lot of  them don   t think they have that safety net and more times than not they  will quit a job rather than try to explain or get time off from their  employers. I think if we just have a little safety net there to encourage  the employers to be a little more proactive that they would feel a little  safer in doing so   the victims would and they could work and help each  other. I   ve had one bill that   s flown around a few times here. Made it out  of Senate, didn   t make it through the House that I   m going to revisit this  year and I   m going to rewrite it just a little bit. I   ve looked at what some  other states are doing so I   m going to try to tweak it a little bit.  Did you actually write it yourself?  Well I tell them  the staff  what I want   the ideas I want in it and they  do the actual language.  And then you do some research to prepare, you tell them what you want  in it?  Yes. Yes I do.  I need to learn more about how the bills start, just an idea that you work  it forward and it might take you a year or two.  Well sometimes it does. Sometimes, yes. In addition to that, I   ve worked  with the American Cancer Society. We also have a cancer caucus out  here too. Again, I lost my husband to cancer so I   m going to be very  involved in every cancer issue that there is out here while I   m here     among other health issues. But I introduced a bill last year to require  insurance companies to cover colonoscopies. This is big on the  21  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  American Cancer Society   s list too. For a number of reasons   but first  and foremost, it   s one of the few that you actually, in fact it   s the only  cancer that I   ve read of so far, that you can actually prevent. You do a  colonoscopy, you see polyps, you remove them and you prevent that  patient from having cancer because it   s the polyps that turn into cancer.  And insurance companies have bought it and so we haven   t got it done  yet. Some say that they do cover it, but here   s how they get around it.  They say they   ll cover it if you   re symptomatic or you have a family  history. Well there   s enough statistics now to show that family history  doesn   t hold water. There are a lot of them that get it that don   t have a  family history. Symptomatic   this particular type of cancer, if you wait  till it   s really detected, you   re in late stage cancer. So the chance of your  survival is pretty small. And if we screen, we can save 80 or 90  of  these people. I mean, statistics are hugely in favor of doing this and right  now, this summer, there   s a new procedure out that   s similar to a  sonogram or ultrasound type of procedure   something similar to that. I  forgot what they call it   which isn   t as costly or invasive as a  colonoscopy but will still show the physician those polyps. But if they  do see them then they can do the surgery and remove them. So I   m  hoping that that new procedure will help us advance that bill this year.  Do you have to have a co-author in the House?  Yes. In fact our rules are   we have to have an author in the House  before we can have it heard in committee. Right.  I guess that   s kind of hard to do sometimes too, to find someone who is  willing to     Sometimes   now if it   s an idea that I want to do that I just thought  about, read about or whatever, then you know I   m going to have to go  find someone. If it   s a group, like if it   s the American Cancer Society  that brings me a bill and wants me to offer legislation then they   ll go  find the House author. So you don   t have to spend time getting authors  for every one of your bills.  Well and with the split, with the co-chairs on the committees are a little  bit different too with the split.  It   s a lot harder to get bills heard. Instead of going to one committee  chairman, you have to go to two.  Are visitors allowed to come listen to some of those discussions,  committee meetings?  22  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Oh absolutely. They are subject to the Open Meetings Act so they are  open to the public. And we have two committee meeting rooms here in  the Senate side of 419C and 511A that are wired over the internet that  you can view them over your computer. Now they have sound hooked  up in the chamber of the House. We have audio and video on the Senate  floor, as well as those two meeting rooms.  Well I   ll have to check into some of that.  Yes.  And League of Women Voters, you   re a member of that too?  Yes, I think my dues are probably due again. I joined it a few years ago  and they just haven   t done a whole lot here in Oklahoma County.  (Laughs) Because I   ve talked to a lady here awhile back and I said,    I  know I haven   t gotten a newsletter, I   m sure my dues are due. What are  you doing?       Well, we   re kind of reorganizing.    I had really gotten  involved with them earlier through a friend, kind of through a dare  because that one year that I first joined, I was vice-chair of the State  Democrat Party and the vice-chair of the Republican Party had joined  and so I kind of joined on a dare. It was kind of like, there were people  trying to get both of us to join and we just said,    I will if she will or I  will if she will.    (Laughs)  In most states, what do they do then, if they were active?  Well the League of Women Voters, at least in Oklahoma in the past, has  been a very non-partisan group. They have been very involved   or they  were   in getting information out to voters about candidates and about  procedures   just good, solid information that you can get at an election  board pretty much but they kind of act as another caveat to do that. And  they also hosted another debates statewide congressional-type debates.  Is it just women   s issues?  Not so much. Not so much that I saw here in Oklahoma. I think some  other states they may have. But so they haven   t done much in the last  year or so.  What   s been your most memorable event during this whole   since  December of    03?  Memorable event?  Yes, getting one bill passed or a particular constituent that you were  23  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  able to successfully help?  There are so many (Laughs) events that happen in the life and day of a  legislator.  One or two?  Well I know one weekend, I showed up at a church for a couple   s 60th  wedding anniversary that I   d gotten word from a family member about.  And we do these little certificates of congratulations and stuff and I  showed up to present one to them at their anniversary and you would  have thought I   d handed them a pot of gold or something. They were  just so tickled, they were just so appreciative. It   s just a little thing to do,  and it doesn   t take that long to do one or spend the time to go over there  for a little while. You know, that was just marvelous.  Or run into someone in the grocery store that you helped them with a  problem with an agency or some service they were needing and they  come up and thank you and hug you. Now that makes it all worthwhile,  (Laughs) let me tell you, it really, really does. But if I had to say as far  as a big event   I have hundreds of those little ones. I mean, they   re just  marvelous. The centennial day   I mean, that was such an historic day. I  was in Williamsburg, Virginia earlier this summer and they were  celebrating their 400th birthday. And I remember being there and being  back where in the part of the country where our history, our country  began. Some of that part of the country still looks like it did back in  those days and thinking,    Wow,    we   re just hitting our 100th birthday  and they are celebrating their 400th. Look at how much we   ve done in  100 years.  When I hear some Oklahomans complain about,    This isn   t going right  in our state and this isn   t going right in our state.    Boy, I tell you I go to  conferences and I hear what other states are doing or not doing and I  think,    We are so much better off than other states in so many ways.    I  was a conference here in the city of Council of State Governments a few  weeks ago and I was bragging about our Vo-tech system, for example.  We   ve got one of the best in the country and we have for a number of  years, and other states are still struggling with that and trying to get  people retrained and get kids in the Vo-tech that aren   t college-bound or  whatever. So I   m going,    Wow, we   ve been doing that for a long time  here in Oklahoma.     And talking about our new OEPIC  Oklahoma Employer/Employee  Partnership for Insurance Coverage  program about where the state pays  a large portion of insurance to get more businesses to insure their  employees. It   s still relatively new but we   ve begun that trail and this is  24  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  something other states are still trying to figure out how to do. (Laughs)  So we   ve got a lot of good things going for us here in Oklahoma. Again,  looking at how we   ve progressed in 100 years and right now, the time of  our city here in Oklahoma City, I   m very proud of what our city has  done. We   ve literally transformed this city in the last decade. I moved  here in the early    70s, back when East Reno was nothing but salvage  yards.  Really? Wow.  And then I look and it   s part of Bricktown and all that wonderful stuff  down there   it   s absolutely gorgeous. And you know, we   re rebuilding  our schools and we   re investing in our infrastructure and so a lot of good  things are happening around us. I   ve had visitors from out of state that in  the last couple of years that I   ve just taken great pride in showing off our  city.  You can tell a little bit more about the train trip into Guthrie for the  Centennial? No one else has mentioned that an experience     Oh, I got goose bumps. I just thought it was a neat deal. And     And a wedding too?  Yes, yes absolutely. And just being there in that hall where the first  legislature was. It was very   it was ceremonial for us that it was   I just  got goose bumps thinking,    Wow, this is where it started. This is where  they really were.    A lot of folks in Guthrie were dressed colonial style or  the era there and made it very realistic. They just did a really good job.  The citizens of Guthrie just did fabulous for that day.  The next day that you came in this building, did you have similar type  thoughts? The feeling that now it   s your turn?  Yes, well it made me think about we were reflecting on what we had  done the past 100 years. So what are we going to lay the groundwork for  the next 100 years? Not just my kids    generation, but we need to be  thinking about how we can make the state better   again, if nothing else,  lay some groundwork to start building to keep the state moving forward.  Like Oklahoma City, we want to do things to keep the city moving  forward. We need to be doing that for the state, too. I think that   s going  to take some major changes that are going to be difficult.  Let   s go back just a little bit. Your husband was in office when the  Murrah Building bombing happened?  25  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  That   s right.  Do you remember much about those few days?  Yes, I do. Actually for twenty-one days. I worked for the state medical  examiner   s office then. And I didn   t see much of my family for twenty-one  straight days. My kids were still in school. That was a horrible time  for our city and the state, for that matter. Yes, I was working down there  and I was personnel director but I got put in charge of supplies and some  other things. And we worked. I did get to go home a little bit during that  time but we spent a lot of long hours down there. It wasn   t but a few  days before the city knew we were not in a rescue mode, we were in  recovery mode. That was a very sad time. And what was it? 162 bodies I  believe? So you know   but through that whole horrible experience, the  whole nation saw what great people we had in Oklahoma. You know  they called it the    Oklahoma Standard    by how the rescue workers that  came out of state didn   t have to ask anything, it was given to them. You  know, if they did ask for bottled water, they would get ten bottles of  water. Even where I was working, we had people show up with supplies  and things that we didn   t even ask for. But that   s just how the people in  the state have always been. They   ll give you the shirt off their back and  then some.  Was he in the Capitol that day?  He was in the Capitol that day and I remember that morning shortly after  the bomb went off and we knew what had happened, I was trying to call  him and they had phone lines down though for a few of hours. It was  before we had good cell phones that we have now. They had the old  ones that you would plug in your car but they weren   t working either. So  it was a few hours before we had phone service before I could get word  to him where I was at and that I was not going to be home any time  soon. I wanted to make sure that he could either pick up the kids or get  someone to pick up the kids. I knew they would be worried but didn   t  know where mom was at that time. They were both in school and my  youngest was still in grade school. And sure enough, you know, a few  days later they, when I did get back home and see them, they were in  bed. The first time I went home, they were both in bed asleep but   and I  had to leave early the next morning, and they said,    We knew a bomb  went off somewhere near downtown and we knew you were near  downtown and we didn   t know where you were.    Then Dad finally said,     Well your mom is okay she just has to work.     Scary.  Yes, it was. It really was. You know, he knew I was okay because he  26  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  knew I wasn   t near the building. But it was several hours, like I said,  before I could really talk to him.  And you didn   t really know if there were more.  We had no idea that first day how many fatalities to expect. The first  report I know that we got at our office was, because it was a federal  building, there could have been up to 500. But not knowing how many  were in that day   we didn   t know that until the next day or two before  we started narrowing the numbers down as far as the missing.  And that first couple of hours they didn   t know if there was another  bomb somewhere else.  That   s right too. Yes, because they evacuated at that one point.  The Capitol.  Mm-hmm, yes.  That   s a moment in history most of us will remember.  Yes, we didn   t have metal detectors up here and I remember before they  even   I had made comments to him that,    Anyone could walk into the  State Capitol and carry anything into that building. Aren   t you guys ever  worried about that?     So do you have to come through it too?  Oh yes. I don   t have a problem with it.  No, I don   t either.  I   m glad it   s there. (Laughs)  Do the Human Services have them too? The Department of Human  Services, do you know?  I haven   t been over to their department.  I have one last one if you don   t have anything else you   d like to     What   s your last one then?  When history is written about you, what would you like it to say?  27  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Finchum  Leftwich  Oh     Not an easy one.  No, that   s not a very easy one. I   m not used to talking about myself like  that. I suppose I probably want them to say that I showed courage and  conviction in what I did and when I did it. And that I was true to my  word. If you   re not true to your word out here in this building, you are  not any good. (Laughs)  I   d probably add a little more   that you   ve walked with your people,  right?  Yes, I have.  To go with your campaign slogan.  Mm-hmm.  Sometimes beside, sometimes ahead and sometimes behind     Well you know I had someone early my first session, or during my  second session, I can   t remember which. Anyway she commented about  how she had always been told that my husband had always supported all  my political little activities, even when I think I probably sometimes  caused him a few headaches. (Laughs) And I said,    Yes, he always did  encourage me.    The reporter who was in the room at the time said,     Probably because all the years you walked behind him or something     behind every great man is a great woman.    I said,    You know what, I  always walked beside him. He never made me feel any less.     Well I think you   ve filled the shoes well and we are lucky to have you up  here.  Well I   m the lucky one. I   ve got a great district. The people out there are  just wonderful. They   re just down-to-earth folks. They   re just working  and trying to take care of their families and trying to take care of each  other. My part of town, I   ve always loved it. It   s got that small town  feel; that   s why I   ve always like the South side. It   s got that small town  feel. The people there are just very genuine and very caring and they  kind of look out for each other.  You   ve got their back up here.  I sure try. (Laughs)  28  Finchum  Leftwich  Well, thank you for your time today.  Well, thank you. I   ve enjoyed this. I really have.  --- ---
