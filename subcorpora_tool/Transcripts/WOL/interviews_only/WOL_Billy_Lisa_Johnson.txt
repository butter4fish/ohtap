Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Today is December 3, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re doing an oral history  project entitled    Women of the Oklahoma Legislature, Past and  Present,    and today I   m with Representative Lisa Johnson Billy and she  was elected in 2004. So thank you for having us today.  Absolutely.  Let   s start by having you tell a little bit about your childhood   where  you were born   and then we   ll work our way forward.  Okay. Well, I was born in Purcell, Oklahoma, and I was born in the old  hospital   it   s now becoming a museum so that kind of dates me. But I  spent my early part there in Purcell and actually spent most of my  childhood in Bristow, Oklahoma, east of Bristow on a farm. My father  worked for OG E so we were transferred. I spent my life as a child  riding horses. My grandparents are from Purcell and my grandfather was  a cutting horse trainer. I spent a lot of time learning to hang on to his  horses that he trained. He was very skilled, and sitting on his horse you  had to hang on tight because it would follow any calf that moved in the  arena.  I chased pigs and horses and dogs and cows and chickens and learned to  haul hay. I learned to a drive compound hay truck at a very early age  because if there wasn   t anybody to drive, then it was my dad and brother  and a couple of neighbors bringing in the hay bales and so I would help  drive. That   s how I spent my childhood   running the creeks and picking  up snakes and scaring my mom and just, I had a really, really wonderful  time. I think being with animals and learning to work with animals     personalities was very beneficial to me as a child.  And you had one brother then?  5  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  I have one older brother, yes.  And in high school were you interested in politics or government?  No, no. I   d never been interested in politics in high school. I   m probably  an odd one compared to a lot of my colleagues. In high school, I was  very   I was an artist, so I was very involved with our art club, also our  Native American Student Association, very involved in that. Served as a  cheerleader for a number of years   and at that point, we had moved to  Madill High School. We had a farm and had pecan trees so I spent a lot  of time shaking those pecan trees and loading up my barrel and doing  things like that on the farm, just the things that were necessary to keep it  running. But I was never interested in politics.  As a high school student, I reluctantly   at my parents    urging   ran for  student council when I was a senior in high school, and so I did run. I  felt like I was being pushed to do that by my parents and a couple of my  teachers. I reluctantly ran and I won, and I   m glad that I did that. It was a  lot of fun serving with my friends. We were all graduating that year, so  it was kind of neat having some leadership opportunities as a senior and  looking at how we were going to do the prom and different   the  graduation ceremony and how that was all going to transpire, so that was  a lot of fun.  Then after high school you went where to college?  I did my undergraduate degree at Northeastern State University in  Tahlequah, and I   m very thankful because I had an art teacher named  Dan Baskin who pushed me, pulled me, prodded me to put all of my  artwork together in a portfolio of which he purchased the portfolio. He  did all of my matting for my artwork. My family was not able to do that  for me, and so Dan Baskin did all of that for me. He did it for all the  students that he felt like had a real potential to pursue art in college.  Because of his working, and then my dad, I remember we drove on  campus and I went and actually applied in front of a committee for the  art scholarship. I was selected as one of the recipients and so off I went  to college and sold my artwork literally all the way to Tahlequah. I had  several relatives and friends via Oklahoma City and Moore and Mustang  and on the way to Tahlequah. I had printed my artwork into stationary  form and sold my artwork on the way to college so I would have money  for gas and necessities and things. I had just sold a couple of my calves,  so along with my art scholarship I had my tuition paid for the first year.  That began my career in college.  And then after that, did you work or did you go on for a master   s?  6  Billy  Well, actually I did both, and again, it was not something I had planned  to do. My brother and I almost graduated at the same time. I think I beat  him by maybe a month or two from college. He had gone on to play  professional football, so his college career was put on hold for a little  while but my parents had not had the opportunity, nor my grandparents,  to pursue college and so it really was something new for my family. I  really wasn   t sure what I would do beyond graduating but while I was in  college, I became very active with an organization that I founded, along  with several of my friends, called    Peacemakers.     I had worked several odd jobs, as you can imagine when you   re in  college. I worked as a waitress and babysat and literally did anything I  could do. I did work study on campus, and I also worked in the  Sequoyah boarding school, which is near Tahlequah. It   s a boarding  school for Native American students that come from all over the United  States. Through that opportunity I realized a lot of native kids were  struggling with a lot of issues I had struggled with, and in me arose this  passion of,    How can I help them to get beyond high school and look at  college and look at the rest of their destiny that I believe God has  ordained for all of us? How can I help them get from there to the next  step in their life?    So literally as an accident we formed an organization  called Peacemakers, Incorporated and began doing these motivational  workshops on campus. We worked primarily at that time with Native  American youth high school students, and then we began working with  younger students. Then we began working with all students, not just  Native Americans but we realized that we had something to offer all of  them. So there was a group of us   there were about fifteen of us  Peacemakers in the beginning.  When I graduated from college, my mother was a state employee and  she wanted me desperately to apply for their fitness director because I  had become a fitness instructor on campus. She wanted me to become  one of their activities fitness directors at one of the state lodges where  she was employed. I thought it would be a nice stable position and it  would be money and I would enjoy it, but my heart was calling me to  continue building Peacemakers which had no money and truly, there was  not any road already paved. I took the hard road   which is kind of  typical sometimes of me and I began doing Peacemakers as a full-time  job. Actually, I did that up until I married and had children. So  somewhere along the way, people started paying me to do that and we  actually became an incorporation, a business, and it was just a wonderful  opportunity because I worked with young people from all across the  United States and into Canada and of course, lots of work in Oklahoma  as well.  But during that time, I met a professor that really encouraged me, and I  7  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  met a man who was Secretary of Transportation at the time, named Neal  McCaleb, and Neal and his wife became great friends of mine. Neal   s a  Chickasaw Indian, as I am Chickasaw, and they encouraged me. So I  began my master   s degree at OU  University of Oklahoma . I had never  planned to do a master   s. In fact, when I graduated from Northeastern, I  planned to never, ever go back into a classroom, as probably a lot of  young people do. My trips to the library were when I had an art showing  at the library. I wasn   t very studious at that time. I was more into doing  human relations and art and things of that nature. I was very involved on  campus. I did get involved in Student Senate, again at the urging of  someone else. It had not been my plans or desires but the president, at  the time, of Northeastern was Roger Webb, and Roger obviously saw  some potential in me. I   m not sure how deep he had to dig, but he got  me involved in Student Senate. So I ran and was elected.  At the University of Oklahoma, I became very involved in campus  activities and ran my business from my little storefront shop in Purcell,  Oklahoma. I had a little art studio there and did my master   s and  traveled all over working with young people and doing motivational  organizational development. I didn   t know it was called all of that at the  time though. I really didn   t understand all of that until I had finished my  master   s degree. I had several professors that helped me. I needed a lot  of help. But Dr. Beverly Fletcher was another amazing woman who  channeled me and guided me and she basically defined for me the work  that I was doing with young people. So that   s what I did.  And is that still in operation?  No, I quit doing that. I met my husband through Peacemakers and so he  and I together did the work, working with native youth and it was just an  incredible opportunity. I planned to continue doing that, but when we  had our first child   we had been married I guess about three years and I  had not wanted my own children because I felt like I had a huge number  of kids that were always at my house and just didn   t feel like my own  children   that would just take up more space. At the time, that was my  thinking. But we got pregnant with our first son   we now have three  children   and they   re just the love of my life. After I had my first child,  I didn   t know that I would change my desires, but my desires definitely  changed. I did a quick turnaround and decided to stay home with my  first baby, and so that   s what I did.  And then when did all of the interest in the politics, to run actually     Well, let   s see. Probably my first child was about two years old and  there was a position at the Chickasaw Nation. I   m Chickasaw and my  father was serving on the Chickasaw Legislature. And my dad called me  8  and he said,    You know, you   ve had such a passion for youth and doing  things for family, why don   t you run? While you   re a stay-at-home  mom, you   ll have the time. It will probably be the only time in your life  that you could do this.    And he said,    Why don   t you run and get some  of the ideas of the younger generation on the Chickasaw Legislature?    I  thought,    Hmm, okay.    I   d never thought about doing that, but it  sounded very reasonable to me. I had the time. I could take my baby  with me, and the ability and opportunity to do something for the next  generation of young people was very exciting to me. So I ran and I won  and served. Then had my second child and decided I would just serve  again. So I served six years on the Chickasaw Tribal Legislature, and  then I had my third child and decided I did not want any more politics.  I was a scout leader and kind of typical   I   d become a scout leader, very  active at my church as a Sunday school teacher teaching children   s  ministry, and so from there I decided to really just stay at home.  And what happened is I have a very good friend who has passed on now,  but she   s a former state senator and her name is Helen Cole. Helen Cole  changed my destiny, and I believe that she was used mightily to do that  because I was very stubborn in not wanting to go back into politics. She  called me one fall afternoon and she said,    Lisa, I have a question for  you,    and Helen would often call me. I would help her with little odds  and ends, maybe if she needed a ride somewhere, if she wanted me to  pick up something at the store and drop off to her   and so I just  assumed it was something along that nature and I said,    Sure, what can I  do for you?    I was sitting there with my new baby, about a year old now  at this point, and she said,    I want you to run for the House of  Representatives,    and I literally laughed. I was drinking a cup of coffee  and I was like,    I don   t think so,    but I didn   t say that out loud because  you don   t say those things to Helen Cole. And she said,    Now before  you answer me, I know that you tell me you   re a woman of faith so I  would assume you   ll pray about the matter.    So what do you say at that  point? And I said,    Oh, yes, ma   am. I will pray.    I hung the phone up  and I thought,    Well, I don   t hear any booming thunder from the Lord to  tell me to do this so I don   t think so,    and I didn   t give it another  thought.  She called me three days later almost to the exact time and she said,     Lisa, Helen   what did the Lord tell you?    and I said,    Miss Helen, I  haven   t heard anything so I   m kind of thinking that   s a no.    She said,    I  believe you   re wrong and I believe you are supposed to run for the  House of Representatives.    I laughed and I said,    Helen, first of all, a  woman   s never been elected in my House district. My political party has  never been elected in my House district, and a Native American has not  been elected.    And I said,    Helen, in case you don   t know, I don   t come  from a family of wealth or political prestige. I don   t have anybody in my  9  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  family or my husband   s family that could even offer any type of advice  in this arena.    She said,    I believe you   re supposed to run, and I am  going to make sure that happens.     A few months after that, Helen had a stroke and she ended up passing  on. The time that she spent in her hospital bed, she spent making a lot of  telephone calls, and she was literally paralyzed on one side of her body,  but that did not stop her in her eighties from making phone calls to  people who would then call me and encourage me to run for the House  of Representatives, and I felt that sense of obligation. Here   s a woman  who really believes in me, who overcame those obstacles herself when  she first ran. She was a bank teller when she first ran, and I thought,     How can I tell her no?    So I really felt that strong obligation, especially  seeing her in the hospital continuing to work,    No excuses      that just  kept coming back to my mind,    No excuses,    and so I made the  decision. I remember when I went in to visit with her and I said,    Helen,  I   ve made the decision, I   m going to run,    and she said,    Good, I   m  glad.    And of course she passed on just a few weeks after I had finally  told her, and I   m glad that I did tell her before she passed on.  How had you met her to start with?  Well, Helen is Chickasaw and I   m Chickasaw, and being a former  Chickasaw legislator   or when I was a legislator   she and I had met at  different events. In fact I was the chairman of a committee that helped  set up the bank for Chickasaw Nation and we were in the process of  interviewing bank board members, and her son, Tom Cole, was one of  the folks that we interviewed. So I remember   of course I already knew  Helen at that point, but kind of made those connections, but we had met  just at tribal functions and events.  Tell a little bit about your campaign.  Well, the campaign was definitely a shoestring campaign, and it was a  door-to-door campaign. That was the only   probably the only asset I  had. Helen told me, she said,    If you don   t wear out a good pair of tennis  shoes, you didn   t knock enough doors,    and so that was the one thing I  had. I could knock doors, and I could jog from house to house and  literally I would jog from house to house. I got chased by a lot of dogs  and outran all of them except one Chihuahua. That one got me on the  back of the heels, but that   s how we ran our campaign.  On most days, it was myself driving, but I tried to work out two or three  days a week   I campaigned six days a week   never campaigned on  Sunday, but I always tried to make sure that there was a friend or my  mom would come down. My mom helped take care of my children, so  10  Finchum  Billy  she really couldn   t help me campaign a lot and my husband was working  five jobs to help pay for the campaign and then he was also my number  one sign man, so he was pretty filled up doing things. But I would try to  get a few of my friends that would drive me because it made it go a lot  quicker. I could get more done if someone was driving me. That way I  could just jump out at each house, run, knock the door, come back, jump  in the car and we could go down the road   but that   s literally how we  ran it. I would pack a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or a bologna  sandwich in the mornings and if I had a bag of chips or a pickle and  something to tide me over for the afternoon   and whoever drove me, I  would always say,    I   ve got a PB J or bologna, which do you prefer?     and that   s how we ran it.  And then election day, what was that like?  Well, election day was very nerve-wracking. I just remember waking up  going,    Oh, I just want to get this over with. I just want to get it over  with as soon as possible,    and my mother had been preparing for several  days to have a watch party, and so she had been cooking. She is a  wonderful cook, and she   d prepared all kinds of wonderful food   and so  that evening we had a little place in Purcell where we sat all the food up  and I was so nervous. I just   now that   s the part about campaigning that  I don   t like to revisit. The campaign day, the actual voting day   it   s  very nerve-wracking.  I began that day at about 6:30 that morning. A friend came down and I  had people located all across my House district. We did something a bit  unusual but I was an unusual candidate so I had to do things a little  unusual. We did sign waving, and a lot of people laughed at us but we  were on the corners in the different parts of my district. So I did that all  day long. I went from one part of the district to another part to another  part to another part. So by seven o   clock, I was worn out from doing all  the sign waving but I had a lot of people that helped me. So there were  Billy waving signs all across my House district. At seven, I made sure  that myself and several of other friends who weren   t sign waving, that  we had gone out and provided hot cocoa and candy bars to the teenagers  and coffee to the adults that had been out sign waving. It was very cold  on that day in November, so we made sure that they were all invited to  come eat at the watch party, so they had their bellies filled and warm  coffee or warm tea.  Then we received the call probably around 9:30 and it had started  pouring down the rain and they told me that I had won. And I said,    I  don   t think all the precincts are counted yet.    I still didn   t believe it. I  just couldn   t believe that I had won, and they said,    Most of the  precincts are in   more than fifty percent of the precincts are in and  11  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  you   ve won.    I just remember thinking that,    This is overwhelming,     and they said,    You need to come to Oklahoma City.    I remember  thinking,    I just want to go to bed. I   m so tired. I don   t want to go to  Oklahoma City.    But a good friend of mine who   s   I lost my mother  about fourteen months ago, and a good friend of mine who   s like a mom  to me, she said,    You get in my car. I   m driving you up there. We   re  going.    And so we drove to Oklahoma City and celebrated with  Congressman Tom Cole and all the other new House members.  We got home after midnight, and my mother and I stayed up till about  three o   clock. All the kids were in bed and she   d spent the night with  me. My husband was out of state working one of his five jobs to help  pay for the campaign, bless his heart, and my mom and I stayed up on  the couch till about three, just talking, back and forth. And just the  excitement and just hardly believing what had happened because of the  poverty that my family has overcome. My little grandmother chopped  cotton, picked cotton, drug her babies through the cotton fields, and  when the cotton season ended in Oklahoma, she   d move to west Texas.  She would chop and pick and whatever new baby, she would tie them on  her cotton sack and drag them through the cotton fields. So it was really  a great moment when I won. I felt like I   d won for my family. And so  that   s how it happened.  And then swearing-in day?  Swearing-in day     Did they all show up?  We only were allowed actually one ticket to get in because it was so  crowded in the gallery on that particular day, and so I was able to finagle  around. There were a lot of House members that had been sworn in  before, it wasn   t that big of a deal to them, so I was able to get several  other tickets so my children, my mother and my husband could be there  on that day. That was my first time to ever be on the House floor. I   d  never   a lot of my colleagues served as a page or had done an internship  or had an uncle who worked here or a grandfather   and I never had any  of that. Living in rural Oklahoma on a farm, I   d never been to the State  Capitol. I never toured until after I was elected, and it was very  overwhelming for me being sworn in.  I   d say, yes. Did you come down Lincoln Boulevard that day?  I did, I did. And I looked at the Capitol and I just felt this overwhelming  sense of opportunity and duty.    I have a huge responsibility   35,000  bosses live in House District 42, and they   re all my bosses.    I remember  12  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  I just stopped and I prayed. I knew nothing, and so I asked the one who  knows everything to help me, to give me wisdom, and I still do that. I  still, when I drive down Lincoln Boulevard, I look at the big Capitol and  I think,    My gosh, I work there. I   ve got a big job. I   ve got to make sure  I   m doing it right so that when the next woman chooses to run for this  House district, people will say,    Well, you know,    ole Billy, she did  pretty good. I   d elect another woman.       So it   s very important to me that  when I leave office that I leave it perhaps better than I found it, but that I  follow in the footsteps of the person who was here before me, but that  the person who comes along   I leave some type of a model so that he or  she can also leave it better than they found it.  Do you remember the first day you debated a bil?  (Laughs) Oh, my gosh. Yes, I do. I was as scared as a cat in a doghouse.  It was very nerve-wracking. The only speech class I   ve ever had was at  Northeastern State University, and it was just your basic speech class.  We didn   t debate   it was just learning how to stand up and present an  argument or an opposing view or sometimes the same view as the  class   so I   d never had that experience and it was quite overwhelming  for me. My hand was shaking so bad. I was holding my microphone and  I kept switching my microphone and I would try to hold my arm so that  it wasn   t apparent that I was shaking in my shoes. My knees were  knocking. It was very overwhelming for me.  Did it go well though? Did you win or     It did. It passed. It did pass, and it actually became law   that particular  piece of legislation.  And what was it? Can you tell a little bit about it?  It was a pro-life piece of legislation. It empowers women when they   re  pregnant and perhaps didn   t mean to be pregnant   it gives them all the  information about their unborn child. It certainly doesn   t take their right  away   if they still choose to terminate the pregnancy but it does let  them know what   s inside of them, provides an opportunity to have a free  ultrasound if they so choose. It also provides a waiting period of three  days. I figure if you can go in to refinance your mortgage   and you do  have to wait to do that   then perhaps women need to have an  opportunity to review the information of a living child that   s inside of  them. The other piece   there were actually four parts to that, but one of  the important pieces to me besides the information aspect, was that if a  woman is murdered when she is pregnant, that person will be tried for  two deaths so that we   ve actually recognized an unborn child as a living  being and that   s very important to me. So it still had several processes to  13  Finchum  Billy  go through, but it did become law.  Were there any other ones you want to talk a little bit about?  Yes, actually there was an idea that came from   I have three children     my husband and I have two boys and a girl. And my oldest son when he  was ten   he   s now thirteen   but when he was ten we were driving  down I-35 in Oklahoma City and there were pictures of billboards that  contained pornography, advertising various clubs that you could go to  view these women. I felt very vulnerable as a woman, especially if I was  on a business luncheon and I had to view these with other men in my  vehicle. It   s very embarrassing, at least for me. But it was my young boy  who said,    Mom, I don   t think women should be allowed to be portrayed  that way. Why don   t you do something about it?    I looked at him and I  said,    Masheli, I can   t do anything about that.    I said,    That   s too big.  That   s bigger than me,    and he said,    Well, someday Mom if you   re  ever in a position to do something about it, you should.    And then of  course later on I was elected   which I wasn   t planning at that point     and then I won and I remember he came back to me and he said,    Mom,  do you remember we said if you ever became in a position of influence  what you would do?     Of course he was a Cub Scout   he had just earned his Webelos badge  and was working on his Arrow of Light and so he was very, you know,  duty and responsibility and making our community better, all very  important to him   and I said,    Yes, I remember that.    It was my second  legislative session that I decided to do something about it. I actually  patterned the bill from two other states. Missouri and Massachusetts  already had on their books laws that prevented pornography from being  displayed. And it was very descriptive in the law how we define  pornography, and so I took those actual bills and we re-wrote them. I  worked with an attorney here on the House staff, and it failed in  committee the first time. I had everyone stand up and say,    You   re  taking my   ,    you know,       first amendment, free speech   you   re  attacking my rights,    and so we worked on it. It affectionately became  known as the    Billy Billboard Bill    and then after we re-worked it and  re-worked it, then it became the,    Bigger and Better Billy Billboard  Bill.     There was lots of teasing, as you can imagine, that went on when I  would present the bill in committee   sometimes embarrassing, but I had  to keep my focus of how to make our highways family friendly and not  embarrassing for women, especially for my daughter. And so it did  become law but it was held up. There were some groups that claimed it  was unconstitutional, and it was a very long process before it all  happened, but it did finally happen. I   m very happy about that and I   m  14  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  very thankful that I had enough of my colleagues who also shared my  vision to help me to make that happen.  If you hadn   t been re-elected, would there have been someone to carry it  on? I mean, you had a second     I did. I actually didn   t draw an opponent in my election.  Okay.  And so I was automatically re-elected and I   m very glad that I was there  to help make sure that it went through. I don   t know if it would have had  I drawn an opponent at that time.  Any other bills?  There are several other bills. I think those are probably the most  passionate to me. We   ve done several other issues that I think are  important, but my passion and my heart really rises up when it   s issues  that impact families and children and making things safer for  Oklahomans.  Did you have a role model once you got here?  Oh, I think   I didn   t know anybody that was here. Helen Cole had  certainly been my role model and I grieve for her. I wish that she was  here. There are many times I wanted to pick the phone up and say,     Helen, I need help. What do I do now?    There really wasn   t. I   ve  developed very close relationships with several other women that are  elected, and we   re often given different titles, you know   the    band of  women,    the    three musketeers.    But I definitely have found my role  model since I came here now.  And who would that be?  Representative Lee Denney   she   s my role model, that   s who I wish to  become when I get older. Yeah, that   s who I want to be when I grow up,  as they say. She is a strong and courageous woman and not afraid to  stand up for what she believes in and she   s a great mom. She and I both  stayed home when our children were little and, of course, her children  are off now and it   s great to see the work of her hands. So, yeah, she   s  who I want to be.  Well, do you live here in town or do you commute back and forth?  Oh, I commute. It   s about an hour drive, depending on the flow of  15  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  traffic, but I do commute. My husband and I have three children and it   s  very important for me to make sure I have breakfast on the table. My  mother did that growing up. We had biscuits and gravy and sausage and  pancakes and hash browns and   I don   t do all of that at the same time     but I always pick. If we have hash browns, we   ll have eggs. But that   s  very important for me. I want to make sure my children are well-fed and  their clothes at least semi-match. When my husband   s in charge, they  don   t always match, but at least he can get them seasonal. If it   s cold,  he   ll dress them warm. So that   s the main thing. But I have lots of events  in my district as well in the evenings.  During session, it is challenging because we   re about fourteen hours a  day working on legislation so I don   t always get to attend the events. My  husband and children are usually out and about and attending. Phillip  and I are both very active in the community but sometimes I   ll come in  at midnight exhausted, and when that alarm clock goes off the next day I  definitely feel it, but it   s worth it.  So a typical day, you would get here about what time?  Well     During session?  During session, I normally pull in around 8:15. I drop my children off at  school around 7:30 and, depending on the drive, I   ll get here 8:15, 8:30  in the morning. And from the time I drop my children off till I arrive  here at the Capitol, again if there were no wrecks on the road   I   m  generally already on the phone and talking to other House members  about what committee work, what bill   s coming up in committee, and  how can we make this flow and then we begin. We run literally from  meeting to meeting to meeting. I visit with constituents pretty much  every day, either on the phone, e-mail, or they   ll come to my office. I   m  always available. Those are the people who put me here, and I feel like  they   re most important.  My second job is to make sure I do what they need me to do, so I have to  be at committee meetings, I need to be on the House floor. I don   t miss  work. My father and mother definitely had a strong work ethic, and I   m  very thankful   I wasn   t always thankful as a child. There were Saturday  mornings I didn   t want to get up and go break the ice. I had a big brother  who did most of the hard labor around the farm, but my parents   I saw  them work. I saw my dad who had fallen off an electrical pole   he was  an electrician   who still got up and went, bandages on his face. My  mom went to work every day whether she felt good, whether she was  running a fever. When you run a farm, you have to take care of the  16  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  animals regardless and so I really appreciate that strong work ethic.  There are some days I would rather stay in bed and just drink coffee, but  I can   t do that. There   ll be a time for that, but it   s not now.  What committees are you a member of or chair, co-chair     Well, I chair a new committee. The Speaker of the House created a  committee called the International Tribal State Relations Committee.  When I was elected, one of my goals was to form better relationships  with the tribes in Oklahoma. The tribes in Oklahoma formed the  infrastructure of our great state, and I   ve always sensed that tribes have  been left out of the process of negotiation, sitting at the table, and so I  was able to form, along with a couple of my colleagues, the Native  American caucus. So what Speaker Cargill did when he was elected  Speaker is he came along and he said,    I want to keep the Native  American caucus and I want to keep everything you   re doing, but I want  to make it a little more official so we can have a committee that we can  actually run legislation through.    He created the International Tribal  State Relations Committee, so I chair that one.  I serve on Transportation. Living in rural Oklahoma   highways,  bridges, very important in particular. When we   re running tractors  there   s no shoulder on the road or moving hay from one pasture to  another, it   s very important that we get those shoulders on our roads. So  Transportation is something I serve on. I also serve on the Human  Services Committee and then, of course, Families and Children, another  passion of mine.  What has been your biggest hurdle?  Oh, gosh. I think I   ve had a lot. Catch-up learning   a lot of my  colleagues have a lot more experience than I do, so I feel like I   ve been  in House of Representatives maybe not even 101, just like your    Prep  Class to the House,    or    Prep Class to Class 101.    I really have felt like  I   ve needed to catch up, just even understanding the process of how  committees work, of how we run bills, of how the Senate works, of how  we work with House staff. I really wish I would have learned more. I  wish I would have been more active in college, but I wasn   t. I was very  active in other organizations, and those have played a key role in my  life, in particular with the Native American caucus. I know tribal  members and now leaders all across the state in nearly every tribe  because of my previous activity. So those have come to play, but I think  playing catch-up.  I think being a woman, many times if we   re assertive or we really work  hard and we want to get things done sometimes   we maybe have certain  17  Finchum  Billy  names or titles stuck to us, if a woman is very assertive. I think  sometimes that   s the challenge and we have to work to overcome it.  Certainly I did have people in the campaign who just would not vote for  me because I   m Chickasaw Indian and that hurt sometimes and so I  would always say,    Well, I   m half Irish, too.    I   m not sure they believed  me, but I would always try to say,    Well, I   m Irish,    and certainly my  political party in my House district. I   ve had to work very hard to let  people know that I   m a person and I   m going to vote what my district  wants. This is my political party, but here   s what my district wants, and  so I think   at least I hope   my prayer is that I   ve proven myself and  that my district realizes that I   m a hard worker whether I   m a female,  whether I   m Indian, whether my political party.  I   ve worked very hard, but the assets of being a woman are great. We   re  much more detailed-oriented. I try to call people on their birthday   I  don   t get to do that every day, but I actually go through my voters    list  and I call people, and 99 percent of the time and sometimes 100 percent  of the calls I make, people really appreciate that. I think women, because  we are detail-oriented, we can remember. When I see people at the  grocery store and in my district, I remember their daughter had won one  of the relay races last week,    How   s your daughter? That was so great  that she won that. I saw her run, she   s really fast,    or    How   s your son  doing? He   s first-year of college. What   s going on with him? What  sports is he playing?    I think women have that ability because we can  move from the right side to the left side of our brain, and so I see it as a  real asset.  One thing my mother always taught me is whatever people see as a  detriment in you, as a negative, as a deficit, you are responsible for  turning that into a positive and you   re the only one that can do it. You  can either believe that,    Oh well, I   m not smart,    or,    I   m not an  attorney,    or,    I   m a woman.    You can believe that or you can say,     Yes, I am a woman. No, I   m not an attorney, but I can read,    and so     lots of reading involved. But definitely I think any negatives can be  turned into a positive. You might have to work a little harder, but that   s  okay.  While we   re on the subject of women, what advice would you give to  someone that was thinking about running?  Oh, I would say,    Do it.    I would say,    Do it.    Just like Helen Cole told  me,    Just do it, Lisa. You can run this race. You can win. Don   t give me  any more excuses.    I think we need more women in politics. I think  women bring a wonderful balance. I think women bring a personal  perspective of what it   s like. When we talk about children and families,  who better than the wife? Who better than a female to bring those  18  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  perspectives forward? Not to say that men can   t do it. I have a wonderful  husband, but women can bring so much to the table.  When we can manage   I remember one time I was in the dollar store  buying candy to throw out at a football game. All three of my children  had a major breakdown at the same time      I want this,       I want that,        No, she gets this,       No, you give that to me,       He took that away from  me      and we all had our campaign t-shirts on and I thought,    Oh, great.  If we only just didn   t have campaign shirts on, nobody would know who  I was.    And everybody stopped and looked at me like,    I wonder how  she   ll handle those kids of hers.    I looked around and I remember  thinking,    You know, if I can handle my children   s selfishness, not  telling the truth, always wanting it my way, don   t want to be a team  player, I think I   m ready for the House of Representatives.     Women bring that experience with them everywhere they go, so I would  encourage every woman to get involved. Maybe it   s not in the House of  Representatives, maybe it   s on the local school board council, maybe it   s  in the city council. In Purcell, we have the second woman, Mayor Betty  Gerhard, serving as the mayor of Purcell. Only the second woman in  Purcell   s history, and she   s definitely setting a wonderful road that  others can follow. So I would say,    Go for it.     And then about juggling family life     It   s a challenge. It is a challenge. Of course, my mother has passed on  now. She was a huge help to me. She lived an hour away from me, but  she would drive down and she helped me incredibly. It is a challenge,  that part. There   s just no denying, and there are things for me personally  that I   ve had to let go of. I can   t tell you who Hollywood actors are right  now. I have no idea what movies are popular. I don   t watch any of the  current television shows. When we do watch television, we watch Andy  Griffith anyway but I   ve had to give up a few things. I really don   t have  any hobbies, I guess you would say, but I really enjoy my life and I   ve  always wanted to put my photo albums together with my children. I  don   t have time to do that, so I have them in a box. Someday I   ll put all  that together. But you definitely have to give up some things, but I figure  whatever television shows are on now, if they   re really good     Re-runs.     I can watch. I watch Andy Griffith re-runs, so I figure twenty years  from now I   ll watch all the re-runs of what was popular in 2007. And so  it   s okay, but you do have to give up   my house is not as clean as I wish  it was. That   s the other part, and I do like a clean house but I can   t do it.  The real positive thing is my children and my husband have learned to  19  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  do more, they didn   t know they could do. My daughter, who just turned  six, she can do a whole lot, and she didn   t know she could do that much.  So I have to bring in the troops and get all the help that I can. The kids  know when mom comes home I like things clean, and they do a really  good job for children, so that   s the good side of it is they do more now  than they used to.  Do they cook? (Laughs)  You know, I did get   they   re not great at cooking. Now they can open  up blue box macaroni, but I don   t often buy that because I   m more of  a   I prefer homemade things. If we   re gonna make biscuits, pull out the  flour. It   s just cheaper. But I did put my son in charge of mashed  potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I thought it would be a simple   I   d  already cooked the chicken,    Here   s the mashed potatoes   I   m running  to a meeting, I   ll be right back, your dad will be home soon.    He totally  scorched the mashed potatoes   ruined the pan   had to throw the pan  away. He said,    Mom, I can clean it.    I said,    I don   t think so.    But it   s  just one. It   s okay. (Laughs)  Didn   t burn the house down.  It didn   t burn the house down. He   s a good kid. So they do know how to  make toast and grilled cheese sandwiches, and they can open a can of  tomato soup   so I figure that   s pretty good.  At that young age, do you think they   re interested in politics themselves,  do you think?  You know, politics sometimes can be so demanding and challenging that  I don   t know that I really encourage my children to go into politics. But,  interesting enough, my oldest son, who   s now thirteen, attended a fall  retreat with the Chickasaw Nation. There were probably three-hundred  teenagers, young people that attended, and he ran for the Chickasaw  Youth Council     Well, that   s a start.     and I didn   t encourage him, and I didn   t know he was gonna do it, but  when he came home, I think there were fourteen that were ultimately  elected. He said,    Mom, I didn   t plan to run, but just something in me  said    I   ve got to make a difference.       And then my husband looked at  me and he said,    I wonder where he   s heard that from.    So I thought,     Oh, great,    but I don   t want to encourage them but yet I do want to  encourage them. I can   t help but encourage them to be involved, maybe  not politically but to be involved actively as a community town member.  20  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  So we   ll see what happens with that.  What happens after you finish your twelve years? Back to art?  Oh, maybe sleeping for a few nights. I don   t know. I   ve really not   I  probably should be more visionary. I can serve eight more years, but  right now my main goal is to raise my children, get them off and give  them a strong foundation of whatever they want to become in life.  Serving my House district, trying to be the best wife I can be   I don   t  know what I   ll do after twelve years. I literally may just ride my horse  around my pasture and enjoy the sunsets.  Put your photo albums together?  I may put my photo albums together, that   s right. (Laughs)  When you were campaigning, did you have a slogan?  I don   t know that I really had a slogan. I probably should have now that  I think about it. Most of my campaign   my husband, I   m very fortunate,  he   s a very good writer. I   m not a very good writer, but I can tell him  what I believe or what I   d like to see happen and then he can put it on  paper. But I do remember one line that said,    Tougher than you think.  Works harder than you believe,    and I remember I liked that line  because a lot of people did only see me,    Oh, you   re the mom,       Oh,  you   re a housewife,    because that   s what I really was doing, I was a  housewife. I taught a few classes at OU, two or three a year in the  Department of Continuing Ed, but certainly didn   t work full-time  outside my home at that point when I ran, so I think a lot of people,  because of my profession of being a homemaker, I did have to work an  extra step. Perhaps a woman who was already employed outside the  home, she may not have had to work that hard, but I think a lot of people  saw me as,    Oh, yeah, she   s the mom. We see her at the park swinging  her kids,    and so I think that my husband helped put that together        Tougher than you think. Works harder than you can imagine.    I think  he probably did that to let people know,    Yes, she pushes children and  changes diapers, but she   s tougher than you think.    So I guess that did  carry on a few of them, so maybe that was it.  And do you have colors? Did you have colors for your signs   particular  ones?  On our campaign signs, we used blue. I really wanted to use burgundy  because that   s my favorite color or red. I had several people say,    That   s  just too feminine,    and I went,    Okay.    My husband said,    Honey, I  really think blue will be great.    So we went with blue, and it   s good.  21  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Blue   s good. I just   red and burgundy, maybe some lavenders in there. I  couldn   t get anybody   all my volunteer team   and these are not  political pundits   these are just normal folks like myself. They   re like,     I don   t think so.    I   m like,    Can   t you see like a lavender with a  burgundy outline?    They go,    No, we can   t see that.    So I gave in, and  all the campaign signs were blue.  Did you have a consultant or you just figured it out yourself?  No, I couldn   t figure any of this out by myself. Helen Cole was actually  my beginning consultant, and I   m very grateful. I don   t think I even  realized then what she was doing for me when she would tell me,    Lisa,  you have to knock a hundred doors a day. Lisa, you have to be on the  phone with people. Lisa, you must do this. You must have large  campaign signs so everybody can see them. You have to strategically  locate them.    Well, that   s a great campaign strategy. I just didn   t realize  it at the time.  But before Helen passed away, she had several people she wanted me to  contact, people who had lots of political experience and so I ended up, I  did that. For me, it was very beneficial because they had years of  experience that they could help me with. The good side is that my  husband is a good writer, and so he could do all of my writing for me so  that saved us money but it also came from my heart and not from maybe  a person sitting in Tulsa or Oklahoma City. So, yeah, we did   in a way,  we did. But eventually we did have a full-time consultant that would  help me. I   m very grateful that I did that because I knew nothing about  the campaigning.  Do you speak Chickasaw?  Well, I speak Chickasaw and Choctaw, but I   m not fluent in the  language but I speak okay, maybe depending on who you ask. Ask one  of our elders and they   ll encourage me and say,    She   s doing good, but  she has a long way to go.    Ask my children, and they think we all just  speak all the time, but that was our first language for our children at  home. I   m very fortunate my husband grew up speaking Choctaw and so  that has been a great help, but yes, we speak.  Do you want to say something so we   ll have it on record? You   ll have to  help translate it later.  Yes, I   ll translate it.  Is that putting you on the spot too much?  22  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  No, not at all. I would say     Johnson Billy says phrase , which is more  of the Choctaw way of saying,    Hello, how are you?    Or if I was  speaking to a Chickasaw, I would probably say     Johnson Billy says  phrase , which is another greeting. I love to start, whenever I   m  speaking somewhere, I really love to say     Johnson Billy says phrase   and that just means,    This is a great day.    When I say that, it is a great  day but there   s much more behind just saying it   s a great day, and if I  say it in English, it   s just not as meaningful for me.    It   s a great day.     Okay, great.  When I say     Johnson Billy says phrase     It is a wonderful day.    It is a  wonderful day in Oklahoma when I can win this election, when someone  like myself can run for politics and actually win. When someone like  myself, who   I   ve lived in poverty, I   ve lived in middle class   I prefer  middle class, I don   t like poverty, but I know how to survive in poverty.  When a Native American can run in Oklahoma and win, it is a great  day.     Well, my last question then is when history is written about you, what  would you like for it to say?  Oh, I guess I would like for it to say,    She was a great mom and she was  a great cook.    That   s what I would like for it to say.  Great cook? What do we cook that   s great? Do you have a favorite  recipe?  I make great Indian tacos and enchiladas and biscuits, and I love to make  chocolate gravy. My grandmother always made chocolate gravy, and my  mom taught me. Of course, I can make white gravy, too, but I love  chocolate gravy   and when I make gravies, whether it   s brown gravy or  white gravy or whatever, it   s symbolic to me, too, because my  grandmother made gravies, as a lot of people did in Oklahoma, because  it was a filler, it was cheap. And so my kids love my gravy. Last night I  made a great deer soup. It was really good. The kids loved it, and there   s  just nothing more satisfying to me than after my kids eat cornbread and  soup and they go,    Wow, mom. That was so good.    That   s just very  satisfying to me.  Does chocolate gravy actually have chocolate in it?  Yes.  And what do you serve it over?  Well, biscuits.  23  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Biscuits.  Yes, I serve it on biscuits. It kind of looks like pudding but you make it  like a gravy. You still use bacon grease, but you put cocoa and sugar in  it along with your flour.  It sounds good.  It   s very good. You should try it. It   s really good.  I grew up with sausage gravy and red-eye gravy.  I don   t do red-eye gravy. Now my husband will put red-eye on my white  gravy just to kind of make his own. He really likes it, but I don   t know  how to make that one.  You use coffee.  Oh, I didn   t know that.  My grandmother would use coffee to do red-eye gravy.  Really?  Pour it into your grease drippings.  Oh, really? I had no idea. I   ll have to look that up somewhere.  That   s good on biscuits, too.  Yummy.  Some of my Tennessee coming out here.  There we go. That   s right. Yeah, I love sausage gravy. Absolutely.  Did you have to buy a new wardrobe when you started this job?  I did. You know that was very challenging for me and of course I didn   t  have the money to do that, and so I   m very grateful. I had five friends  that gave me clothes. I had five different women   one was my sister-in-law     but I had five women give me clothes, and I was so grateful. That  got me through my first legislative session because we were depleted.  Financially I was exhausted   and I don   t like to shop. That   s the weird  thing about me, I   m not a shopper. And I   m very fortunate, I have a  sister-in-law who loves to shop, and my brother doesn   t like for her to  24  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  shop all the time so this gives her a great reason to go shopping   but she  does a lot of shopping. And she   s a great sale shopper, so she picks  things up for me. But those five friends, I   ll tell you, I would not have  made it because my   teaching at the University of Oklahoma, I taught  at Sooner Flight Academy, we wore flight uniforms. I was teaching math  and science to fourth graders. We wore our flight uniform because we  were talking about NASA and talking about flight and aerospace and so  we just wore jeans or shorts under the flight uniform. So after I won, that  was my next step. My mom said,    Oh, you have to buy some clothes,     and then I found out there was a dress code to be on the House floor.  For women, too?  For women, yes. And so I thought,    I don   t have any clothes like that,     and our church where we go is a small country church. Even at church, I  mean, you don   t have to dress up and so, yeah, I definitely had to do  some shopping, but then after I had all my friends give me clothes, after  about a year or so, they thought,    Well, okay Lisa. Now you   re gonna  have to do this on your own.    I thought,    I don   t know how to do that.     So Representative Denney has helped me quite a bit. I   ve just   frankly  that was not important to me. Jeans and a sweatshirt and a pair of boots  and a good pair of running shoes. I figure that   s all you need.  I understand it has to be warm clothes.  It has to be warm clothes. The House floor is chilly, and then a lot of the  men like to turn the fans on and   yeah, we   ve taken blankets down  there. (Laughs) Definitely had to change my wardrobe.  And then where do you sit in the chamber?  Right now I sit about mid-way back on   I guess kind of the middle  really. A little bit, I guess I   m right at the center line, on the right of that  center line about halfway back. And they pretty much do it by when  you   re elected.  Okay.  As you become a junior, a sophomore or senior, then you slowly move  up to the front. I kind of like sitting in the back myself.  See more of the action?  Yes, yes, definitely. And plus you can walk out the back door and run  and get you a cup of ice or a glass of water and not have to make a big  scene and walk in front of everybody, so     25  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  Finchum  Billy  When you were a freshman, how many other women came in with you?  Do you remember?  Let   s see   women that came in with me   Lee Denney, Ann Coody,  Marian Cooksey, Sally Kern. Sue Tibbs was already here, Pam Peterson  was already here. I think four or five, if I haven   t left anybody out?  Yeah, there weren   t very many of us that came in. Odelia Dank was  already here, but certainly more women than has been, yes.  There are nineteen currently if I   ve added correctly.  Oklahoma has typically been around the 47th in the nation on women  holding elected positions. I think we went down to maybe 46th, 46.5. We  still have a ways to go, but we   re improving.  They   re lucky to have you here, too.  Oh, well, thanks.  Okay. Well, if nothing else, that   s all I have.  All right. Well, thank you.  Thank you. It   s been a pleasure.  Yes, it   s been a pleasure.  ---  ---
