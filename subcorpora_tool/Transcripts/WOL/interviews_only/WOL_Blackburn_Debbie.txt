Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Today is May 23rd, 2008. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m here  today with Debbie Blackburn, who served in the House of  Representatives in Oklahoma from 1994     I was elected in    94 and started in    95, yes.     and termed out in 2007.  Yes.  And this is part of the OSU Library   s project called Women of the  Oklahoma Legislature. So thank you very much for joining me today.  Glad to be here.  Let   s start by having you tell a little about your childhood, and then  we   ll move forward.  I grew up in northwestern Oklahoma in Woodward   was born there and  graduated from high school there. My father was a small business  owner. My mother was a homemaker most of her life, although she had  worked in retail prior to that. I   m the oldest child of three. I have a  younger sister who   s three years younger than myself, who   s an  attorney. I have a brother who   both of them are OSU graduates. My  brother graduated from OSU and has worked for Ditch Witch in Perry  since he graduated. Northwestern Oklahoma   s a sparsely populated part  of the state. It definitely has its own culture that   s very different than  southeastern Oklahoma, or even northeastern Oklahoma, or even  southwestern Oklahoma.  I   ve heard sometimes that Oklahoma has more geological and bio  diversity than any other region, than any other state in the Union, other  5  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  than California. I think culturally, we have the same thing. That   s what  made politics so interesting, because the cultures are very, very different.  The culture I grew up in was pretty Midwestern. Basically, it had  already changed, before the rest of the state, to more republican. But it  wasn   t the modern kind of republicans. It was early on Nelson  Rockefeller kind of republicanism.  My dad was a P.O.W. in World War II. I grew up with a large extended  family. There are still a lot of them in that area. I was a baby boomer, so  I had a lot of freedom that a lot of kids today wouldn   t understand. We  could go out and run four blocks away from home, and play hide and  seek, or go to my grandparents    farm out in the country and build dams  and build forts. And it was a very free childhood, very fun childhood.  In high school, did you have favorite subjects? Happen to be politics or  government or   ?  It was history. I was very interested in history, culture, and sociology  and what makes society run, what has brought changes on. I   m  interested in how people operate together for the common good.  And then college. Where did you go?  My undergraduate is from Southwestern State. My first job was a  teaching job. I taught in Altus, Oklahoma. I do have postgraduate hours  from OSU, but I never got a master   s or a higher degree simply because  I   m such a generalist that I could never figure out what I wanted to go  into, and I didn   t want to be tied down.  Not yet?  No.  When did you become interested in running for political office?  I never had any interest in running for office. I was approached because  my predecessor was going to retire, and she had just made this decision.  And there were two weeks before filing. I was approached and asked to  run, and I said, very firmly,    No.    I had helped   it   s not that I   m not  interested. I   m very interested in what   s going on community-wise. And  I   d been very active on a volunteer basis, but I never wanted to get into  politics because I just didn   t think that was my thing. I   m too  plainspoken, and I don   t have time to play games. It   s just not my  personality. So that doesn   t always make a good politician, and I just  didn   t think that I was going to run, but my husband was very  supportive. I had all these reasons why I couldn   t do it, because of this,  6  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  this, this, or this.  At that time, I had a 12 year old at home, but of course, I lived in  Oklahoma City two or three blocks from the Capitol. So it wasn   t as  though I wouldn   t see him. But, I had all these excuses why I couldn   t  run, and every single one of those evaporated so that I didn   t have any of  those excuses to hide behind anymore. And so, ultimately, on Fourth of  July weekend, the weekend right before filing, I decided that I would go  ahead and run even though I had made no preparations, had not begun to  fundraise. A lot of people start years out and I hadn   t done any of that.  But I just jumped into it and said, you know,    If it   s supposed to be, it   ll  be, and if it   s not, it won   t.     Who was your predecessor?  I had a female predecessor, Linda Larason.  Who was your first campaign manager? Yourself?  Myself, absolutely. Because, in the first race we had, it was my husband  and I. I felt sort of like the little red hen. Now I had good help from my  predecessor, but I didn   t think that I could afford to raise money to pay  somebody when I needed to use all my money on printed material and  other things, and signs and so forth. So I literally ran my first race  myself which was a mistake because I was spread too thin. I didn   t have  the contact with the voters that I should have had. Consequently, I came  in, in a squeaker, which was a shock to me because I   d been so active in  the community that I didn   t think that I   d have to explain to as many  people who I was.  I found out that people want you to ask for their vote. They want direct  contact, especially at that level. A house district was a lot smaller than a  city council ward in Oklahoma City. So it has to be very personal, and I  realized after the election, which we did win but it was much narrower  than I would have hoped for, that I wasn   t going to do that again. I  would hire somebody to do the nuts and bolts stuff so I would have more  time to campaign.  So you knocked on more doors the second time?  I did. I did. The first time, I did not knock as many doors. I didn   t  make as many phone calls. And the second time, I made sure that I  knocked as many doors as it was humanly possible to do. Actually, I  knocked every door that I could, I think every door of registered  voters   high percentage voters, I made it to the door.  7  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Did you have a slogan?  What we used on the sign was,    Debbie Blackburn works for you.    I  thought that kind of went back to my roots as being a volunteer activist  trying to improve things. I had run an initiative petition before.  Oklahoma City tried to have a vote on different issues to fund different  things in Oklahoma City. One that failed was more money for police  and firemen. And in working with neighborhood associations   which I  did   I knew that there was a lot of support for the fact that as big as  Oklahoma City is in square miles, that we needed more people on the  ground, both in the fire and the police departments, because these calls  were not being answered fast enough. And that failed. It failed, I  thought, not because people didn   t support that, but because so many  other things were put into the package.  I was then working as a director of an organization that was a nonprofit  that helped support neighborhood associations and improving quality of  life, essentially unpaid. I had been on the board of directors, and the  organization began to have trouble. So I stepped off   financial  problems. I stepped off the board, became the executive director in  order to try to help right the organization. And during this time, the  election for the police and fire went down, and we decided to go ahead  and try to do this initiative petition. I had no idea   no idea (Laughs)  what I was getting into   how difficult that is. The length of time that  you have to try to get those signatures is almost impossible unless you  hire help. So we had a lot of volunteers getting petitions, but I also had  to raise money.  We were trying to stabilize our organization, to run the initiative petition  and have enough people on the ground to get those signatures, which we  did. I think that   s one of the reasons that, given my background and the  community activism, people came to me thinking that I would be logical  to try to continue in that role in the legislature. So that was some of my  background, and that   s why I went ahead and decided to run. I have a  flaw that if I am even driving down the street, I tend to analyze the  condition of the roads and the housing and just all the whole social  conditions. I   m very interested in the whole   the community and how it  works together holistically, and that   s just   I guess it just seemed a  natural then that I would try to get into improving the district at a larger  level, at the state level.  Would each subsequent campaign go a little smoother? Any more  squeakers?  Oh, no. From then on, we were winning by nearly 70 , from that time  on. Yes.  8  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Knocked on doors each time or name recognition?  It helps after you   ve walked once that much that you can go to the  phones and do other things. So I didn   t walk as much after that as I  walked in    96. In    96, I was out all the time. I   m frankly glad that I had  done that, because    98 was the summer we had 120 degrees every day,  and I took to the phones. It really would have been ridiculous to be out  in 120 degrees every day. When you opened the door, it was like going  out into a furnace. And actually, people won   t open their doors to you  when it   s that hot. Everybody kind of avoids the heat, so I did change  the way I campaigned after that. I was able to go to the phone more.  On your first swearing in day   can you tell a little about what you were  thinking and feeling that day?  Wondering what I had gotten myself into. (Laughter) Hoping that I  would be able to make a difference, that it wouldn   t just be time spent     that there would be a result. It wasn   t fully euphoric. I was grounded to  know that I needed to do something now that I was there.  Where was your first desk on the floor?  It was at the back. That   s all I remember. (Laughs)  And then when you left? When you termed out?  Based on seniority, you got to choose where you sat. I actually did not  want to sit right up at the front. I preferred sitting at the back, but my  deskmate did get me to move a little bit forward so that we were in the  middle. We were not at the front but we could have been.  You were there when the dome was being put on?  Yes.  Any thoughts about     About the dome?  Yes. It   s impressive when you come down Lincoln     I think it needed to be finished but I think maybe it would have taken a  republican to get it done, because there would have been more criticism  of a democrat. You know, tax and spend   that kind of thing. So I think  it took a republican to actually push that out there, kind of like Nixon  going to China because he always talked so loudly against Communism.  9  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Then a lot of people felt that it was safe for him to go and negotiate.  The same thing   I don   t think a lot of the democrats in southeastern  Oklahoma complained about the dome when there were poor people that  needed to be fed also. But I personally thought it was something that we  needed to do to show that Oklahomans finish projects, and that we do  things properly, and we have high standards.  The Murrah Building bombing came in within all that, and that was in  my district, and the Oklahoma standard   the way we operated during  that crisis   went all over the country. And I think that   s something that  we still need to keep in mind, is that we don   t need to do everything  cheap, quick, and dirty. If you do that, you ultimately lose. You lose  economically, you lose in every way. You cannot attract people. You  cannot attract companies. You can   t attract economic development. So  I think the dome was a symbol that Oklahoma is in business, and we do  things right. And we do them high quality. I think that   s what we need  to aspire to.  Where was your office your first term?  It was in an area called the fish bowl.  Okay.  It was where they put freshman democrats, and all the freshman  democrats were in that area, all eight of us. On one side of one office  was Jari Askins, who I shared a secretary with, and on the other side was  Clay Pope from Loyal, Oklahoma, who   s also a northwesterner. And  my other classmates were Joe Eddins from Vinita, Bob Plunk from Ada,  Abe Deutschendorf from Lawton, Barbara Staggs from Muskogee   is  that eight? Who am I leaving out?  So three women?  There were three women which was very unusual because the total  number of women in the Oklahoma Legislature has always been  proportionally less than other states in the Union   drastically lower.  And for one class to have that many females   that was the democratic  side. There were also females on the republican side. For that many  females to come in at one time was really unusual, very unusual. And  unfortunately, we didn   t maintain our numbers. Our percentages of  women have dropped.  I think the most has been 20, maybe, at one time?  And I never saw that. There were very few women when I was there.  10  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Well, the few that were there, did you do things together, or was it more  party line than gender?  There really was not a female caucus, if that   s what you mean, no.  Occasionally we would have an end of session party or something. I  didn   t go to all of those. But no, we really didn   t. We were too busy to  do a whole lot together.  You were close enough to live at home?  Yes.  So, describe a typical day for you. How early would you get there, and  that sort of thing?  Oh, you always needed to be up there at least by seven     A.M.?     if not before. In the early days when I was there, it was not unusual  for us to go to midnight if things were not proceeding as they should.  Later on, we had floor leaders who organized it in a way that we didn   t  have to keep those kinds of hours, so that was much better. But a typical  day at the Capitol is almost like somebody would describe someone who  had ADD  Attention Deficit Disorder . You have to be on top of all  kinds of things. You might be thinking about something that has to do  with education, and you are always fair game when you are up there.  You don   t have a lot of time. You can   t sequester yourself. Lobbyists  are always pulling you off the floor to talk to you and constituents could  do that too.  If you were in your office and somebody came in they would want to  talk to you right then. It was difficult because you might be pulled   I  felt like a Gumby doll sometimes   you know, different directions   180  degrees. Somebody would want to talk to you about an insurance bill  when you were trying to think about, and didn   t have time to get to a  conclusion on something that had happened on education. So you don   t  have a lot of time. If you   re out in the hallways, or if you   re anywhere  in the building, you   re fair game for anybody that wants to walk up to  you and try to turn you in a different direction. So it was very frenetic     very, very frenetic.  That pace increased at the end of session because things that had been  put off   or not really even put off, but decisions couldn   t be made,  agreement couldn   t be reached   finally, it was only reached sometimes  at the end because we knew that time was running out. People would  11  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  finally make an agreement. You would have huge important things being  done in the waning minutes when you didn   t have a lot of time to  analyze it the way you should. And I did not like that. I didn   t like that,  the way that things played out. I never ended a session feeling very  good about what had happened because of the fast pace that we shot  things through at the end sometimes.  In a normal day, how many bills might be covered?  Oh, that varied. When you   re in the first of session or when you switch  the bills from one house to the other, a lot of bills haven   t had time to get  out of committee. So you might go to the floor in the first days of the  session and just have roll call and not vote on a single thing because  nothing has come out of committee. You   re spending most of your time  in committee rather than on the floor. And then, after the bills get out of  committee, there were days when we literally sat on the floor. I can  remember some days   from early in the morning, like eight in the  morning, to midnight, with occasional breaks. Sometimes, they would  just bring food in. We would not even get out of the building, they  would just bring food in, and we would take a break, eat the food, come  back into the chamber in 30 minutes.  You had to learn to multi-task.  Yes.  Do you remember the first bill you presented?  Actually, I do. It was a child support bill, and I thought it was very  logical. So I probably wasn   t as prepared as I should have been because  I was shocked by the fact that there would be any opposition to this. But  what I found out is there are a lot of things that people will not express  to you because they don   t want to be embarrassed. Why they would not  support something that logical and that good for kids   they just won   t  support it   because they may have emotional reasons. They may have  had family that have gone through a divorce and have sympathy for one  side or the other. And so they   re not going to express that, but they   re  just not going to be for the bill.  I learned with that first bill that a good idea doesn   t always mean it   s not  going to have a lot of trouble and that logic does not always prevail.  That emotion, you know, men like to think of themselves as rational     that   s always been the stereotype   and not emotional. I found that  wasn   t the case. There was a lot of emotion that went into a lot of this  stuff that you couldn   t put your finger on. And so my first bill was a  child support bill and the response to it was a shock to me. I thought I   d  12  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  have no opposition, and I was astounded when I saw the reaction.  I take it, it didn   t pass?  Yes, it did. In fact, I got an award two years in a row from the Child  Support Association of Oklahoma for work that I did in that area. There  were organizations of non-custodial parents who fought tooth and  toenail anything that would try to force both parents to be of support to  their children. You know, that just didn   t make sense to me because if  they don   t pick up the support, it   s the state that ultimately has to help  keep that child alive and going. And to me, it was totally irrational. It  was an emotional response and very vile. A lot of those groups, non-custodial  parents particularly, they were male   very misogynistic and  very emotionally driven by their own previous problems. It was very  interesting.  Any other bills you want to talk about that were near and dear to your  heart?  I was the author of the Tuition Savings Plan Act for college. I asked  Governor Henry to be my Senate author, and he liked it well enough that  it was one of the things he touted when he ran for governor. I   m very  proud of that. I   m also very proud of something that is still being   will  probably be dealt with for as long as I   m alive and even more after that.  One December   and I can   t remember exactly the year   it was either  2001 or 2002, I had some friends from southeastern Oklahoma contact  me about a water sale that Governor Keating was putting together, to sell  huge quantities of water outside of Oklahoma to Texas. And they didn   t  seem to be able to get their representatives to help them   to be  responsive. So they called me, and I knew what a fight this would be  because this is the black gold   right now. This is the most important  thing around   is water. Boone Pickens would tell you that. He owns a  lot of it, and he would like to sell it.  The thing that bothered me about the sale was not that they were selling  it so much as is we had never done a study in Oklahoma to know how  much we need. And in a state that had gone through the Dust Bowl, and  growing up in dry northwestern Oklahoma. Now, right now, the  technology to pump the water from the eastern part of the state to the  western part of the state is not where it needs to be because the western  part of the state is higher in elevation   but, eventually, that may occur.  And my thinking was that we needed a water study   a true, good water  study. Texas had had one. That   s part of the reason they were coming to  us. Plus, I found out later   at that time, I didn   t know that much about  water law   that Oklahoma   s water law is real giving. If you ask for  water, you   ll get it. And so, because we had that   and nobody wanted  13  to   in the state, nobody wanted to touch that because it   s like opening  Pandora   s box. If they could have just kept it the way it was, it was  okay.  They were being threatened by water taken out of the state. So all of a  sudden you had this alliance of very unusual people who usually won   t  work together, and hate each other   Farmer   s Bureau, Farm Bureau,  who hates the tree huggers, the Sierra Club, the independent oil  producers. And the reason the independent oil producers were opposed  was because Keating had included the Choctaw   s and the Chickasaw   s  in this sale and was going to give them 50  of the proceeds of the  money made to keep them from suing the state for selling the water.  Now, I   m not opposed to tribal sovereignty, but one thing I didn   t think  was that the previous federal cases on fights between states on water did  not   they had not made decisions that the water belongs exclusively to  the Indians. They have found, in fact, the opposite, and I thought that it  was premature to start going off and selling huge quantities of water  when we didn   t know how much we would need. Plus, they were  talking about building huge reservoirs in Oklahoma   in other words,  taking the land of Oklahomans, turning it into reservoirs so that Texans  could get water   and not asking Texans to conserve the water.  In large part, the economy of southeastern Oklahoma is dependent upon  tourism, and all these same Texans come up into the beautiful pine  forests of southeastern Oklahoma, and they use the water there, they use  the lakes, they fish. That is a key part of Oklahoma   s tourism. If the  water   s taken down to a certain level, aquatic life cannot survive. And  they had this argument that the water was going into the Red River,  becoming saline and unusable. We knew that wasn   t right. We talked to  agronomists in Arkansas who had land along the Red River and used it  to irrigate. Now, if an agronomist is doing that, then there   s not a  problem.  Also, it looked like good ole    boy politics to me, too. We heard instances  of newspaper editors in southeastern Oklahoma that were all of a sudden  all for this, wanted to sell the water. People had been promised that this  money would all come back to southeastern Oklahoma, and they could  dictate how it was going to be spent. And I knew when I got into it, it  would be incredibly difficult. It was the kind of thing that everybody had  turned their back to, including those representatives from that area  These people were very sincere, and they really cared about their area.  And so we began to try to run a bill and to see if we could get  agreement. I met every single Friday, every single Friday, with these  groups that normally couldn   t even talk to each other, about how to set  up the parameters for a water study of Oklahoma   s water usage. We  14  included quadrants of the state like they did in Texas when they did their  water study. You   d have people from all four quadrants and the  panhandle; you   d have irrigators; you   d have agriculturists; you would  have oilies; you would have municipalities   everybody that had a stake  in the water to be involved in the water study.  I had to have a Senate author, but I was told by Senate leadership     democratic leadership   my own party, that there was only one particular  person that would be allowed to take that on. The Senate was going to  control the bill because they knew there was a lot of concern about it. I  even had people   state employees who were working against what I  was trying to do. And you   d think, they worked for the Water Resources  Board, they   d be working for the plan. But they were very political, and  they knew that the governor was behind it, a lot of big moneyed interests  were behind it, and so they were behind it. They were very politically  savvy. They walked the halls and tried to work against my bill, which I  thought was astounding for state employees.  When it came out of the Senate, it was not a true water study. It was a  legislative water study and that was a joke. It was a farce because  legislators   you have to have equipment; you have to go down and  measure the water. Really, to do a good water study, you need ten years  to track the water in a river bed to see how much the water ebbs and  flows until you know how much is needed. It never occurred but I was  able to get a moratorium. I will fully admit I did demagoguery. I was  able to debate Keating   s right hand man who had negotiated that sale,  Howard Barnett, on television and get it into the paper. We were able to  embarrass enough people with that kind of high profile that the sale was  put on hold, and I was able to get a moratorium on the sale until we did a  water study. So that   s probably one of the things I   m proudest of.  Somebody was elected from the southeastern part of the state where that  was going on, and he ran just because he cared about the water   who  had the same interests I had. So I finally got an ally and that was Jerry  Ellis, who   s still in the legislature. Jerry expanded my moratorium in  length of time because we hadn   t funded it immediately. And before I  left, we finally got the money to do the water study, to start the water  study, which is undergoing now. The difficulty is that Fort Worth     Tarrant County   sued the state of Oklahoma within, I think, the last  year, asking for more water than every hamlet, hole in the wall town or  community, city in Oklahoma uses   more water than Oklahoma uses     every town, every city. And it   s been taken to court and we   re right in  the middle of that right now. I think what, hopefully, the Attorney  General is arguing is that it   s very legitimate that we be allowed to have  a water study, too.  15  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  It is possible because of down river dependency, that if we ever get this  water going that way, we will never get it back. Let me give you an  example of that. New Mexico sold water out of the Pecos to Texas.  And when New Mexico usage went up, Texas wasn   t given the water  that they had been promised under their compact. So Texas went after  New Mexico in order to get them to fulfill the agreement they had. The  courts upheld the agreement and said that New Mexico had to get the  water to Texas one way or the other. So New Mexico had to start  buying water so that Texas could get as much as they had been given.  This is the danger. Water is the black gold. There are countries in the  world that are fighting now, and they   re fighting over water. A lot of  people don   t even realize that. They hear about these wars there   it   s  largely due to water.  We   re a western state. So this is a critical issue, and I think it   ll be  critical for a long, long time. And I   m very concerned about what will  happen. Will southeastern Oklahoma be made a fiefdom that can never  compete economically because all they   re going to be used for is dams  and lakes to feed northern Texas   which is booming economically?  And that means no water then for Oklahoma City, or no water for Tulsa,  or no water for western Oklahoma when we need it   when we get the  technology that will allow us to reasonably transport that water from  southeastern Oklahoma or eastern Oklahoma to the drier parts of the  state. I think that   s still up in the air. That   s all very critical. And I hope  that the courts recognize that Oklahoma has a right to do a water study  before we have all the water just arbitrarily drained out without any idea  about how much we need.  Now that you   re out, can you help get some other     Actually, I have been kind of quiet about the whole thing because I was  told that, as the legislator who ran the original moratorium on the sale,  until we had a water study that it might be misconstrued or used in court.  So I have been keeping a very low profile on it and not talking about it  while it   s still in the courts. And my argument never was,    Well, we can  never sell any water.    I never said that. We just need to know how  much we need before we go selling everything off and see dollar signs.  Texas came up here because they knew it would be easier to get from us  than from other parts of the state. What does that say? What does that  say about the leadership of the state, or what does that say about our  water laws?  That   s a big shoe to fill, too, if you   re not there to help push it along.  Also, I was very interested in education. I was a chairman of  appropriations for education in the House. Let   s see, I guess the second  16  Finchum  Blackburn  to last session that I served before the democrats lost their majority,  education has been one of my primary interests, always has been. So I  was very interested. Unfortunately, I served during the time when we  had that incredible downturn, when the head of the Office of State  Finance grossly overestimated and I might say I suspect because he  wanted to do tax cuts. They were talking about tax cuts. So they grossly  overestimated what our revenue would be   that was budgeted. In the  middle of the year, we saw that we weren   t going to get that kind of  money. That   s never happened before. That just doesn   t happen. And  schools and everybody was left in the lurch until we could get to the  next budgeting cycle to give them money to make up what they had lost.  But those two years, it might have made it easier for me because we had  no money. All we did was cut in those two years that I had that position.  It was very painful because there are a lot of areas that are, especially  Common Education, given all kinds of mandates, but we don   t give  them the money to do what we tell them to do. And so that was very  difficult for me. But it was a great opportunity. I was really looking  forward to being in that role my last two years when the democrats lost  their majority, and I wasn   t even able to serve on the committee that I  had chaired. They wouldn   t even allow me to sit on it.  Where did you go from there, then?  The last two years were very, very frustrating because the rules of the  House were changed to operate to be like they were under Newt  Gingrich at the Congress. It was very, very difficult to amend a bill     just almost impossible. We just didn   t have any debate. That continues  to this day. There was no good debate, and I will say that the democrats  didn   t always treat the republicans fairly, but we always allowed debate.  And sometimes debate would go on for hours on a single bill. Nobody  was cut off. But that wasn   t allowed. Debate has been stymied and  stifled, and you can   t amend bills on the floor. There are very strict rules  about how you amend them in committee. It   s gotten even worse. I  didn   t like the way the democrats always operated, but it got very, very  bad at the end.  The democrats would have been willing to put me on the Appropriations  Committee, which I had chaired, but the republicans would not allow  that. They didn   t want me even on the committee, so I wasn   t allowed  to even sit on that. That   s something democrats would never have  dreamed of doing. They did allow the republicans to pick who they put  on their committees, but we weren   t allowed that, we weren   t allowed  that same thing. So my last two years were quite frustrating, to watch  the democratic process just really, basically being shut down, where  there was no debate. The rules were actually changed on the floor. I  17  Finchum  Blackburn  mean, we would have rules that they said   this is the way it operates  yesterday, but they would change them for themselves. And so, it was  very frustrating the last two years.  Someone knows they   re going to term out   is it similar to that, the last  two years always kind of rough?  No. No, it was different because I was in the minority, and there was no  amending of bills. It was made almost impossible. There was no debate  on the floor. It was very difficult   very, very difficult. They wouldn   t  recognize you to speak. They just wouldn   t allow people to speak   very  undemocratic   very, very undemocratic. And I have criticism for  democrats, too. I think that   s one of the things, maybe, that made me  not a very good politician because   or not a natural politician, because  game playing is just not my style. There are too many important things  that need to be done.  I know that you have to compromise but one of my biggest concerns  right now is the fact that the average citizen is just not really being  heard. It didn   t used to be so bad. It was bad in Washington this way.  The people that could pay for lobbyists, were the ones that were always  heard. It wasn   t so bad at the state level. During the time I was there, I  saw it go down or degenerate and I wouldn   t mean by that that there was  any bribe taking or anything like that, it   s just that when you see  somebody up there that has 20 lobbyists, or five lobbyists, or even two  lobbyists all the time, it   s human nature to want to make that person  happy. And you know they   ve got a lot of money to give to campaigns  and so forth.  It   s just gotten to be where the corporate welfare and the exemptions  from taxes   here we are talking about a bond issue, right now, to do  basics. We   re borrowing money to cover our basic needs on roads and  so forth. Why? Because starting when I was in the legislature, we gave  tax exemptions and tax relief to everybody and their dog. There are so  many tax exemptions out there for every kind of thing that   it   s good  politics, it makes sure you get reelected, but, it   s very bad for the state in  the long term, and I have voted for all kinds of tax cuts. I will say that I  do think you can be overtaxed. I don   t think that we are overtaxed in  Oklahoma. I   ve had people argue with me about that.  I don   t like taxes anymore than anybody else, but I do like a decent  society with the basics covered, with a standard, like I was saying, that is  high quality   that proves to people outside the state that we value  quality. We value quality education. We value quality services. We  value cultural things which attract people. They want to come  somewhere where there are things to do, where there   s creativity, where  18  there   s thinking going on. When you   re between forty-fifth and fiftieth  in everything you fund in the nation that tells you something. That tells  you that we are not overtaxed. If you look at the tax burden, we are not  overburdened.  Everybody, when I was in there, they always used to talk about,    Oh,  we   ve got to be like Texas.    Keating loved to talk about how we needed  to be like Texas. I don   t think Oklahomans would want to be like Texas.  If you take the total tax burden   they say,    Oh, they don   t have income  tax.    Well, they made up for it in other ways. They made up for it in  high property taxes and other things that Oklahoma just doesn   t have.  Tax rebates or paying tax back to you doesn   t work in Oklahoma as well  because our taxes, our property taxes and so forth, are so low. You   re  not getting back much.  I fought for years   one of the other thing   s that I   m very proud of that  we did was   which is good for the rural, suburban, and urban areas     was that we got a tax credit for rehabilitation of older buildings that  mocks the federal. So here I am talking about a tax cut, but it makes  sense because there   s a result that has to occur. The person that   s  rehabbing these properties has to put in money and do something to  bring the area up before they get their tax rebates.  So, yes, I was the author of tax rebates and tax cuts, but they were kinds  that were logical. I have to say here, there were so many tax cuts going  on that I had to wait to try to get that done, and by my last two years,  when I thought we were going to get it done, I was in the minority and  even though I had the bill, it was taken away from me and put in a huge  ombudsman tax cut bill. It doesn   t bear my name, but the people who are  in preservation and economic development know that I fought for that  for years and years and it finally bore fruit, although it doesn   t have my  name on it. So I am proud of that. It did have my name on it at the  beginning of the session, and that is an example of a kind of tax cut, or  tax support for business, that produces something for the state,  something for the community, and can be used at the rural level, the  suburban cities, or big cities. It   s good for all. Those are the kinds of  tax breaks we ought to require. Instead we, like on the Great Plains  deal   and I voted for this, and this was one of things that taught me     we just gave like 20 some million dollars to this airline. What do we  get? They went bankrupt. They went belly up, and there was no return.  Look at all these companies that need to have trained, educated people  working for them, that are doing well in Oklahoma now, that are asking  for tax exemptions, tax supports   all kinds of things from the citizens.  And yet they   re not paying what they should be into the pot. How will  they get those kinds of educated citizens that they need if they aren   t  19  willing to pay? More and more, the tax burden is falling on the middle  and the lower classes. This is not just true at the federal level, where  you have Warren Buffet, who says,    When my secretary, who makes   60,000 dollars a year, pays more taxes than I do, there   s something  wrong.    That is occurring in Oklahoma too. And democrats are as  guilty of this now as republicans. That, I think, is the biggest concern  that I have.  I think the biggest change we need in government is public financing of  campaigns. A lot of people won   t understand that. They   ll say,    I don   t  want to pay for politicians to run for office.    But look at the absurd  amount of money that is being spent on this last presidential campaign.  That has trickled down even to state races. When I first ran   I heard to  run for my job in California as an assemblyman, which would have been  my equivalent, it took a million dollars because the districts were so big,  you couldn   t walk door to door. So you had to have TV. That   s  occurring now in Oklahoma. It   s beginning to occur, and the costs are  going up.  Arizona and Maine have made attempts to encourage people who run for  office to take public money and not depend on other people so much. I  think if we went to that kind of system that the people would get more  attention than just the big money corporations or the big money possible  funders for their campaigns. I   ve seen people vote against the interests  of their constituency. I think that they will not be able to vote against  this because it would hurt their constituents. I   ve seen them do it   if  there was somebody that wanted it who had a lot of money, and they  weren   t taking   I don   t mean to insinuate they were taking bribes. They  weren   t. But they just knew this person had a lot of ability to fund their  future campaigns, and so forth.  There are more and more politicians who are thinking more about  survival than they are about making the hard decisions and saying no to  somebody who has a lot of money. I hear people that say, on the one  hand, they don   t like welfare mothers. But those people will give local  tax money, state tax money, any kind of tax money to a corporation that  has already all kinds of tax exemptions. And on top of that, they   re  getting public money in addition to their exemptions. We   re out of  balance. We   re completely out of whack. And I   ve had people tell me,     Well, if you do that, you   ll take away my free speech.    My response to  that is,    It isn   t free if you have to pay for it.    We are supposed to  represent everybody, and it   s getting very, very difficult for most  politicians to do that. They   re not doing that. They   re paying attention  to those people who can afford to have 15 or 20 lobbyists   or even two.  And, yes, they may only get a  250 dollar donation from that entity, but  20  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  I can tell you, if you vote against some of these people, you will hear  about it. They say,    Oh, we just want access.    That   s not true. I have  voted against people, corporations, who gave me money, and I heard  about it. They didn   t just want access to me. They wanted my vote.  And they thought that that donation would be my vote. I think it   s very  critical, and I think there may be people who think, well that   s na  ve  thinking, but I think things are so totally out of whack when you   ve got  one presidential candidate running who raised  31 million dollars in one  month   now, this is one that   s not taking PAC money, which I admire,  but something   s out of whack. Something   s got to give. It would be  better if the money was coming all from single individuals rather than  PAC   s and 527   s.  If you go to public funding, you would have to consider how those  527   s, who can act on their own and do ads for people   would they be  allowed to do that? Those things would have to be figured out. But  right now, it   s out of balance  Campaign finance has been an issue in other states, too. So are there  any models out there that are     Arizona and Maine, and I will say that I had a bill to try to   and I hadn   t  put anything fully fleshed in it, because I didn   t want it shut down.  Now, this was when the democrats, my party, were in control of the  house. I tried to put a bill together that was going to use some of the  Arizona and Maine encouragements towards public finance of  campaigns. And my own leadership sent it to Rules, which is committee  where it   s sent to die. They sent it there to die, because they weren   t  sure what I was going to do with it. So I get as aggravated at my own  party right now, sometimes, as I do republicans, because we   ve always  been the party of the big tent, the party of all people. We   re not acting  like that right now, either, with the demand for money to run campaigns.  When you first got there, did you have someone that would take you  under their wing, and show you the ropes, or     Actually, I did not     No mentor?     and, I   ve always regretted that. There were a lot of people who I  would have really liked to have worked with that went out before I got  in, and therefore I didn   t, or there were people in the Senate that I  admired a lot. But, it   s difficult when you   re working like that. You   ve  got to be working in the same entity, almost, to have contact. So no, I  really didn   t, and that   s something I   ve always regretted. I   ve heard and  21  Finchum  Blackburn  read about people that really got into politics that had someone that had  the time. But with the term limits and the way it   s changed the face of  things, you just didn   t have a lot of those old timers, and it   s getting  worse.  The people   term limits   I   m like everybody else. There are a lot of  people I would have liked to see retire. You know, they got to where  they couldn   t think outside the box. They were always thinking the  same old way and supporting the status quo. I think everybody tends to  do that after you   ve been in an organization so long. But I do think that  you need experience, because it   s not a natural job. There is a lot.  You   re asked to make decisions on everything in the whole world, and  you need that experience. You need people who   ve gone through this,  and what happened in the House of Representatives when I left was   or  my last two years   they fired all our staff, practically all our staff, that  had been there forever   because they had been associated with the  democratic regime. And a lot of them were independents and  republicans, but they were associated with the democratic regime. So  they just fired them all, and there went our institutional memory. And  we were also losing our institutional memory because term limits were  kicking out the older members.  I literally had some staff members who were   I loved working with  these people. They were very honest. When you   d talk about doing  something in a bill, they   d say,    Representative, let me tell you why  that   s dangerous. We tried that in 1985, and we didn   t have any idea  what would be the result of that. But a year later, here   s what was  happening, and we had to reverse it. It seems like a good idea on the  surface, but we tried it and it doesn   t work.    That kind of stuff is good.  That   s good experience. Right now, what you have is a lot of  greenhorns   a lot of greenhorns who don   t have any background. If  they   re pure ideologues, which we seem to have   just, it   s amazing, the  people that don   t want to listen to anybody else.    This is what I think,  so this is the way it   s going to be.    In fact, I   ve had some staffers, there  were very few that survived, but the few that survived, they did research  for somebody on an issue, and the research seemed to show something  that their ideology did not agree with. So they just threw the facts aside  and did what their ideology told them to do. The people that have the  most power at the legislature now are lobbyists and long-time  bureaucrats.  They don   t term out.  They don   t term out. They   ve been there longer. They know what they  want. They know what they can do, and so they can lead these  greenhorns around by the nose and they don   t even know they   re being  22  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  led around. You don   t have any staff that   s been there long term, and a  lot of them don   t have a background in what they   re being asked to do.  It   s quite frightening for Oklahomans as a whole, especially when the  power of money for campaign donations, and even somebody pointed  out to me, possible jobs for the future. When you get out of the  legislature, you want to do something different. You don   t want to make  the people that have the jobs angry, because you might not be employed.  So, that   s another consideration, which I have to admit probably is true.  I would say that I   ve always thought that you needed to have a decent  salary for a legislator so that you could encourage people of all ranks  and files, not just the ultra wealthy, to hold office. Maybe a lady who is  a single mother, to help her, allow her to do that, because it would be  hard to hold position as a legislator, and raise her family, and do all  these things if she didn   t have some money. But I think you can get the  salary so high that you have people running for a job for a salary instead  of to really do anything. So, I think there   s a balancing act. I don   t  think that legislative salaries should go up too high, because then, you  have people running for the wrong reasons.  I   m kind of concerned sometimes. We have people running for office,  and some of them are going to flinch when I say this, that have no life  experience. It   s their first real job, and we are actually electing them to  the legislature. That   s interesting, too. Some of them do a very good  job, but if you   ve never been out and you don   t really know what it   s  like to do this, that   s kind of strange, too. Some of these young people,  though, were some of my best friends, and they   ve done a very good job.  Legislators don   t raise their own salaries in Oklahoma. We have a board  that decides to do that. But I hope that they keep that salary at a pretty  medium level, because, if it gets too high, you   re going to have people  running for money and not for trying to do the right thing.  Or at least running for one term and trying to figure out something else?  Well, most of them won   t do that. I just hate to see people run because  they think that   s their job   that   s their only job.  At any point, did you think of running for the Senate as opposed to the  House?  I couldn   t. We have the toughest term limit laws in the nation. Twelve  years means 12 years   both houses. So I couldn   t run for Senate.  But during your 12 years of service, you could have switched if you   d  have wanted to?  23  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Well, I had a long time Senator there who was of my same party, and  that would have been great disloyalty to challenge.  Do you have any favorite memories of maybe campaigning or service on  the floor or something special?  Actually, sometimes   and I know this may seem strange   it   s not just  the bills that you run that you   re proud of, but things that nobody will  ever know that you helped stop.  Like what?  (Laughs) Well, there are a lot of things. And I won   t be specific, but just  things that are really mean spirited that you were able to stop or hold up.  That is as most satisfaction as passing something and I never understood  those people that just passed things to be passing something, you know,  to make it look like they were doing something. Some of that stuff  probably didn   t need to be done. I think the people that I met   the  relationships   there were a lot of staffers that I had great admiration for  and a lot of legislators that I had great admiration for that were very  brave and stood up sometimes, when nobody else would stand up, and  speak the truth. It   s easy to speak the truth, maybe more so when you   re  not speaking it to people that do have power and money. But that   s what  seems to be the most difficult thing to do right now. So I think it was  relationships, people that I met. I just don   t think that there   s anybody  that doesn   t come in as an elected official that doesn   t have a sincere  desire to do good. I think sometimes people get caught up in it, and their  egos maybe get control of them and they forget that they   re there to do  something and not to survive, or not to be garnering attention. You  know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  So, it   s possible to get off track, but I think everybody comes in with the  sincere desire to do something good. And, everyone, whether they get  off track is another thing, and whether they become a survivalist is  another thing. But I think the people I met, the relationships that I  developed with staffers and legislators are probably my fondest  memories.  Do you stay in touch with some of those?  Yes. Yes.  What was your last day in office like?  24  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Sort of a haze, you know. One of the people I worked with, a legislator,  called me and his 12 years was almost up. He said,    It took me 12 years  to get out of public school, and that seemed like it was so long but this  12 years has just flown.    And I said,    Yes, you get older, and time does  seem to fly.    But, it did seem to go very, very fast. I think that there  was just sort of      Gosh, is this already over, and I didn   t get everything  done that I think should be done?    That was kind of it. It was kind of  like a haze.    Well, that went fast, and I didn   t get everything done that I  wanted to.    So, in a way it was kind of bittersweet.  Have you been back to the Capitol?  Yes, I have. I have, and I was going to try to get up there tomorrow to  see some of my friends who are terming out before they leave. The  water warriors had asked me to come up. They were going to do a press  conference. I didn   t participate in it because I   m trying to, as I told you,  remain quiet. But I just went up there to watch what they did with their  press conference on the water situation and the lawsuit. And so I have  been up there.  Feel a little strange?  Feels very strange. And in fact, in some ways, it   s very difficult because  I do care. I care so much about the progress of the state and the whole  state. When I was campaigning one of the constituents said,    What are  you going to do if something is good for the district but not good for the  state?    And I   d say,    Well, it   s going to be the state.    In that, I   m  unusual because most people think about the people that elect them. I  guess that   s how I got into the water thing because if I had really any  sense about it, I wouldn   t have gotten involved in that. It didn   t involve  my part of the state. In fact, Oklahoma City gets some of their water  from southeastern Oklahoma, and I wouldn   t do anything to keep  Oklahoma City from getting water, but I thought this was something that  was good for Oklahoma City as well as southeastern Oklahoma. We  need to care about the whole state.  I come from northwestern Oklahoma, so it   s just like a line down, you  know. I care about Woodward. I care about Oklahoma City. I care  about Broken Bow. This is something that I don   t understand about  people, why they can   t see this. This is common sense. If one part of the  state is starved out or doesn   t do well, the whole state   s not going to do  well, ultimately. If only certain companies get exemptions or tax credits  or relief, the whole state   s not going to do well, even though the  chamber of commerce might think that that causes economic  development, and they give out jobs. Ultimately, if anybody,  corporation or individual, gets more than their share or has the football  25  playing field tipped to their advantage, they ultimately will suffer, too,  because you cannot do things that are only good for one little group and  expect that the whole will flourish. Ultimately, everybody will go  down   the special interest, the corporation, the one wealthy individual,  or the person that has more sway. They will go down with the rest of the  state if the rest of the state is not treated fairly   if only certain groups of  people are really doing the tax paying.  I think we   ve gone through a period where there was so much bashing of  government, of what it does, of what it does here, what it does on this  campus, what it does for everybody. I don   t understand that, because  you can   t have a civilized society unless you have a government.  Government does jobs that you cannot make money on but you have to  have to have civilization. And the corporations are not going to go and  do most of these things because you can   t make a buck. But those  things   infrastructure, education   have to be done in order to have a  civilized society. We have forgotten that. We have forgotten that  because we   ve had politicians who, to get elected, demagogued and  talked about how horrible taxes were, how horrible government was.  Should we hate it? We should hate it.  And now, you have a lot of people who really do hate government and  see no good coming out of it, see only waste. And a lot of them aren   t  intellectually honest because these same people, then, will fight tooth  and toenail to keep Tinker Air Force Base when the government   s trying  to save money by getting rid of bases and Army posts. They   ll fight for  that, but they don   t want government in other things. But then they want  government for their tax reliefs or their tax incentives or their tax rebates  to help them do their personal business. You know, that   s not popular,  and politicians, most politicians are just not going to say that. But it   s  true, and they get away with it because people have become so  brainwashed over the years and so sickened by the partisanship of  politics that they don   t want anything to do with it. And I understand  that.  I don   t watch TV anymore because we don   t have true journalism. It   s  more entertainment. The announcers argue. I don   t care if it   s liberal or  conservative, arguing with somebody who   s expressing their opinion     the journalist should not even respond to what they   re saying or analyze  what they   re saying. They should just report it. They   ve turned more to  entertainment by nitpicking on some little personal foible or something  that the person does that doesn   t really make any difference. And  because of that, I don   t think that government is operating at as high a  level as it could be both because of the fact that the real important stuff  is not being reported and because of partisanship and because journalism  has turned into entertainment. Secondly, because we have had people  26  Finchum  Blackburn  like Gingrich and others tear down government for so long that the  people have a sour attitude about government in general. And I do  understand that, because sometimes I share that.  It   s very difficult for me to hear sometimes what   s going on at the  Capitol. I get incensed because we   re not operating as we should be.  But I think in some ways we   re not doing that because of the funding  mechanism for campaigns and people wanting to be survivalists and the  fact that the media is causing politicians to be very careful. And being  careful sometimes just means surviving. It doesn   t mean doing the right  thing. I don   t mean to talk in circles, but there are two things there. I  think I do understand why people are frustrated with government,  because I am too, to a degree. But I think we do need government, good  government, and I think it   s very sad that, by all this propaganda that has  been spewed out for so long, that there are a lot of people who just don   t  want to pay anything for government. And we can   t operate as a  civilized society that way.  I   ve got a couple more questions, and then I   ll let you get out of here. If  a woman came up to and said she was interested in running, what  advice would you give her?  We need more women. You could get a group of 12 people in the  House or the Senate that work together that could really affect the  agenda and the way the agenda operated. We never had that many  women. It   s been my experience that, with some exceptions, I will say  there are some exceptions, most women work because they want things  to get done and not because they want to see their names up in lights.  However, there are exceptions to that. And one reason that, with the few  women that you had, they were so far apart partisan-wise, that you could  never really get them together. I   ll give you one example, on abortion  because of the extremes on that issue. Even though that   s a woman   s  issue that you   d think that maybe there   d be some coming together on,  that just didn   t happen. And if you had, I think, just 12 women   a  dozen women of like mind   you could alter the way things get done  because that   s a big enough voting block that you can have a great affect  on what gets done and what doesn   t get done. I   ve seen it. If there are a  group of people of 12 that have enough in common, they can push it.  They can push the agenda. That   s happening in Oklahoma right now. It  has forever.  As an urban legislator, I sometimes found more in common with my  republican compatriots who were urban than I did with those rural  democratic good ole    boys. The rural guys have always had control of  the Oklahoma Legislature, and they have   by the way they redistrict     they have never allowed that to go away. But now, with term limits,  27  Finchum  Blackburn  that   s one good thing I can say about term limits, maybe, is that it   ll be  more equitable. I have nothing against rural areas. I come from a rural  area and I want them to be helped. But a lot of times, the rural areas got  more help than the urban. Certain parts of the state got a lot more  attention. The politicians from that area got a lot more money there.  They got a lot more things done for two reasons. Most of the politicians  that had power always came from east of I-40  I-35 . Think about it.  We   ve only had one governor from west of I-40  I-35  and that was  David Walters. And also culturally, the western part of the state seems  to be real   the part I   m from   independent.    Don   t tread on me; I   ll  just do what I need, and I don   t need government.     Now, the eastern half of the state had a different culture, especially  southeast had a Deep South sort of culture, which kind of had the  grandfather attitude,    We need our money, and we need to get our stuff  down here.    And because that was there the population was, that   s  where you had more politicians, that   s where the money tended to go.  It   s always been that way for two reasons: because the westerners were  too independent   didn   t want it, didn   t ask for it   and the population  was so small, they didn   t have the kind of representation that the east  had and because the east had a culture of asking for more   of  demanding more. The rural guys would keep the urban areas down by  taking the urban areas and just taking a little bit. Each one of them  would take a little bit out of the urban area to add to their rural area, and  that kept the representation of purely urban down. They were really,  basically, a rural legislator. That   s going to change.  That is changing with term limits, and the urban areas will become more  powerful because probably the redistricting will allow them to redistrict  where you   ll have a true urban district, and not one that is a pocket of  urban, surrounded by more rural. So that   s changing. That will change.  It   s always been rural dominated and that will change, I believe, with  term limits. And I say that saying I   m a rural person. I grew up in a  rural area. I taught in Altus, which is   a lot of people would say,     That   s very rural. That   s very out of the way.    But I understand, too,  that to be equitable and to be fair, you need to spend the money where  the bulk of the population is, too, not just in the rural areas. But some  rural areas are so sparsely populated that if it wasn   t for the state, there  would be nothing. And Oklahoma has real challenges. I mean, we   re  twenty-sixth in land area, and some of these areas hardly have anybody  living there, but they   ve got to have roads.  Mm-hmm.  So that makes it even more difficult for us. We   re not like Connecticut.  It   s easier for them to maintain their roads. It   s hard for us. We   ve got a  28  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  lot of area to cover. So we have some challenges that other people don   t  have. Our population distribution is strange. There are three pockets of  population, actually, in Oklahoma.  That   s probably the three that get the most women coming, too?  Yes. Yes. I would compare it to what you see at the presidential  election with Barack Obama. When I noticed the primaries in all these  states where Obama does well is in the urban areas, where you tend to  have more professional people and more people that are college  educated, have a higher degree of education, and I   m not putting rural  areas down. I know   I love rural areas. I grew up in a rural area. But I  also know that, just because of the economic base in the cities, you do  have more college educated people. You do have more professionals,  and consequently, you have a different result. You have more women  elected   more minorities.  Well with the women, too, though, it   s with family, coming from the  rural   two hour drive or whatever to     Oh, you   re absolutely right. I would not have run for office if I had  lived outside of Oklahoma City. And if you look at most of the females  who are in the legislature, for the most part, they   re retired or they   re  unmarried with no children   because, if you have a child and you live  out of town, it   s just nearly impossible. A lot of these guys get away  with it, but as a mother, I wouldn   t have done it. And, it still was hard  for me. Every time before I ran, I would ask my son, who was 12 when  I ran,    Do you feel like you   re ignored? Do you feel like you   re not  getting enough attention?    And he would say,    I wish you had more  kids so you wouldn   t focus on me, just so         and we only had one  son         so you wouldn   t pay so much attention. No, I   m fine.    So,  yes. It   s harder for women. It really is, because you don   t want to leave  your kids. Everybody that I saw on the legislature was retired, and their  kids were grown. I was the only one with a child for a long time, and  you could see the Capitol from the second floor of my house. So that  helped me.  I   ll never forget, I was in a national conference of state legislators  meeting in Washington, D.C. one time, and we had a break, and I was  walking down the hall. I heard these women talking, and one said,     Well, how many women do you have in your legislature?    She said,     67.    You could have knocked me over with a feather  I ran back, and I  said,    Where are you from?    And, I believe she was from Ohio   I think  that   s where she was. I said,    Oh my goodness. I can   t imagine. We  think we   re lucky if we have ten.    She just looked at me like I was  crazy. But hopefully, we   re becoming more enlightened, and the more  29  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  education we have, we will see that it won   t just be urban areas that elect  women and African Americans, and minorities. It will be the rural  areas, as well. But, it seems to have something to do with economic  development   whether an area is booming or there   s fear that there   s  not going to be enough to go around. Fear causes people to do crazy  things like look at people that are different as a competitor or a threat.  You would encourage them to come   any advice as to how to prepare to  do that or what to consider in making their decision to run or not run?  I have a friend who thought about running for the Senate, and she is  younger than I am. She   s probably 20 years younger than I am, and she  has tiny little girls   twins. And she was considering it, and she would  be outstanding. She is a great diplomat. She   s very, very bright. She  has everything. She would be such a great senator, representative of any  kind, any kind of elected official. But her little girls are tiny, and I did  tell her,    You know, you   re stellar enough that you can run at any time,  but I think you   d regret it if you ran when they   re as small as they are.  So I would wait a little while.     Politics is so mean anymore. It   s a game of    Gotcha,    trying to make  people look as bad as possible. And then, I   m sometimes amazed at  what other folks seem to get away with. It seems to have to do with  what your politics are and what the journalists   who they   re working  for   what their politics are. It keeps really good people from running.  It was what held me back even that long ago, because I came in at the  time of the so-called    Gingrich Revolution,    when they turned over  Congress to the republican party and all that hatemongering started. It  had already begun. And frankly, that was one of the things that held me  back, but I thought   and I   m not happy with the way politics is  operating today   but I thought,    If good people aren   t willing to get in,  who   s going to be running it? Who   s going to be running government?     So that   s something that I still think about sometimes. In a way, it   s a  relief to be away from it. But when I hear what   s going on, I get in my  fighting mode, and I   m ready to go back and fight the good fight and try  to do what   s right, what needs to be done, for everybody   not just for  the people that could afford lobbyists, but for everyone. I guess  basically, I   m a populist at heart, is what it is.  You can become a lobbyist, I guess.  I couldn   t be a lobbyist     You couldn   t?  And I   ll tell you why. No, because you have to do whatever the client  30  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  wants you to do. And sometimes what they want you to do is only good  for them and is not good for the general population. I have no desire to  be a lobbyist. I would be a lousy lobbyist, unless I was lobbying for a  group that I believed in so much that, you know, education or something  like that. Education is publicly funded, so they don   t really have many  lobbyists.  Well, what   s next on the agenda?  I don   t know. I   m trying to decide what I want to do when I grow up.  I   ve got some ideas. We have a publishing company, and that   s what  I   ve been working on. But I   m ready to go to something that challenges  me. I   ve thought about going back to school, getting another degree  finally, even though I started post-graduate here at OSU, never  completed it, never completed what I started to do. So, I have not  completely made up my mind. (Laughs)  We   ve covered quite a bit. Is there anything you want to add before I ask  my last question?  I can   t think of anything, and I   m sure, when I walk out of here, I   ll  think of something that I wish I   d said, but     Well, we can do round two if you want to, sometime.  (Laughs) Okay.  I usually end with asking the person this question. When history   s  written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Hmm. That I honestly tried to do what was best for the most people.  That I fought for higher standards for Oklahoma in everything that we  do, so that we can be the best we can be, so that we can attract economic  development without having to pay them to come here, and then seeing  them leave or go belly up, but that they will want to stay here, because  Oklahoma is just so good and so flourishing. But the only way that it  can be that way is if we have high standards, and if we do what   s good  for everybody, not just for a few people.  Well, if they reverse term limits, you need to go back, huh? (Laughs)  I don   t think anybody   s fighting that battle, and I don   t know. At the  point I am right now, it   s so much calmer. I   m so much nicer since I   m  not (Laughs) in the legislature. I   m just a nicer person, I think, to be  around. It gets very frustrating.  31  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  Blackburn  Finchum  I would imagine that it would take a couple of months to get down time  after walking out that door.  I was always at a fever pitch at the very last of session. Yes,  unfortunately, usually frustrated at the things that had happened at the  last minute. And you know, I do understand that, from a human  standpoint, it   s just that, sometimes, things that are difficult. It   s hard to  get agreement on them, and you can   t get agreement on them until  you   ve got the deadline that   s just saying we   ve got to make some  decisions here. But I think some things were intentionally held until the  end so that they wouldn   t have time to be scrutinized fully.  Fly under the radar.  Mm-hmm. Or, as my friend, Wanda Jo Peltier, used to say, wooly  boogers that were put into the bills. (Laughter)  I could imagine her saying that. (Laughs)  (Laughs) Yes. She   s a straight shooter, isn   t she?  She is. (Laughs) Well, that   s all I have.  Okay.  And I appreciate you coming today.  Well, thank you.  It was great.  --- ---
