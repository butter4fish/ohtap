Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Today is November 12, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  OSU Library and we   re working on a project called    Women of the  Oklahoma Legislature.    We   re at the OSU-Tulsa campus and today  we   re talking with Maxine Horner who was in the Senate, elected in    86  and termed out in 2004.  Right.  Thank you for joining us today.  My pleasure to be here.  We   ll start by having you tell a little about your childhood, where you  were born, and then we   ll move forward.  I am a native Tulsan, born here in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I attended  elementary school, which was Dunbar Elementary School. It no longer  exists. I attended Carver Junior High School. It   s now Carver Middle  School, and graduated from Booker T. Washington High School, class  of 1951. We were the first class to graduate from the new school.  They   ve done some current expansions now, but we were the first class  to graduate in the new school when it moved to the site where it is now.  I came from a musical family. My dad was the jazz and blues guy. My  mom was classically trained. I began piano lessons because I loved  music. I always did and was surrounded by music, always. I certainly  liked my dad   s side which was the blues and the jazz   and more jazz  than blues   but mom was the stern one. She made you practice the  lessons you were supposed to learn classically, and she was a classical  singer. As the story was told to us, as a 16-year old, she came from  Muskogee, Oklahoma, and she was in a concert at the Convention Hall,  which is now the Brady Theater. She performed with her high school  5  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  production and received outstanding reviews for her performance.  From high school, I received a scholarship to attend Wiley College in  Marshall, Texas. My dream was to go to Lincoln University in Jefferson  City, Missouri. While I was in high school, I was quite involved in  journalism classes. We worked on the newspaper and the yearbook. I  was one of the students to receive an opportunity to attend the  journalism workshop along with other students who went as well. I fell  in love with the campus. Because I received a scholarship to attend  Wiley, which helped my family financially, I of course, enrolled at  Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.  I remember getting on the train  in Tulsa  and kind of scared. It was my  first train ride. It is so surreal for me now because, 56 years later the  train station is the new home of the Jazz Hall of Fame, which I am the  founder. I can remember when it was a segregated building.  Full circle.  Yes.  Were you an only child?  No. I have a sister and two brothers. I   m the oldest and my sister is next  to me, and then of course the two guys are, we call, the    brats    of the  family. (Laughter)  And when did you get interested in the political arena?  Well, actually I was fortunate to work for Congressman Jim Jones. I  went to work in his office and I was absolutely fascinated with the work  that we did here in his district office. And I did have an opportunity to  go to Washington, D.C. and meet the Congressional staff and legislators.  The type of work we did was as though you became the congressman,  and he demanded whatever his constituents needed, to make sure that  they were taken care of. When he would make his visits to Tulsa, he  would always make sure there were town hall meetings, and all the staff  had to accompany him. Then on the following morning he outlined  every question from every constituent attending the meeting and he  wanted those concerns resolved in a timely manner. He wanted an  instant response to his constituents. And I think that was something that  was so foreign to me because I did not know that politicians possessed  that kind of concern   and maybe they all don   t, but I know he did. He  was absolutely adamant about answering the phone. It shouldn   t ring  three, four, five times. You needed to answer that phone on the first ring,  if at all possible.  6  Finchum  Horner  I was excited about the kinds of things that we were doing. I was excited  about being a part of the staff. I wasn   t thinking about running for an  office but the seat became open. I was always bragging about this  Congressman Jones and all of the things that we did. I just didn   t know  people called and said,    I didn   t get my Social Security benefits    or    I  didn   t get my IRS check    or veterans who had problems and you delved  into it and took care of those needs for people who had exhausted  everything they knew to do to get assistance.  He made sure his office responded to his constituents that he served. So  one of my friends said,    You have been talking about all the things that  you do. You should run for that seat,    and I said,    Oh, no. Not at all.    I  said,    I just enjoy working in the office. I don   t see myself out there as a  candidate for an office.    I kept telling them,    No, I just don   t think that   s  my thing.    And it was my daughter who gave me the push. She said,     Well, all the things you brag about doing in the name of the  congressman, why don   t you do it in your name?    That   s how it all  began.  And how old was she?  She was in her early twenties. So I looked at her and I said,    Well, you  know, we need to sit down as a family and talk about this. Some of the  things that I see candidates go through, every member in the family must  have real thick skin. Because you   re not going to like what they say  about your mom. I   ll become a whole different person in the eyes of the  people. You know me as your mom, but other people are going to see  me differently.    And that   s how it really all began.  And of course, the majority in the race was men. There was one other  female. It was an open seat. So I think in the primary there might have  been ten candidates at the time, and I think I was probably one with the  least name recognition. I had been involved in more things, but always  in the background   stuffing envelopes somewhere, working in the  campaign or knocking on doors.  I   ve always had a competitive spirit. When someone would say,    Oh,  you can   t win.    And then you hear things like,    That   s not a place for a  woman to be. It   s just not fit for a woman.    So I said,    Well, we   ll see.     The more I was told no, the more I pushed forward to win. And I went  through the run-off, which was kind of scary. The person that I most  feared was J. Homer Johnson because he was quite well-known and  quite popular among constituents in the district that we would have both  been representing. I did come out of the run-off as the winner.  I had a general election, and of course I was up against a very prominent  7  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  name in our community. The father was the pastor of one of the largest  churches in our community, Dr. Chappell. His son Carlos Chappell,  who   s a judge now and an outstanding young man, and here we were  side by side running together. I did have the utmost respect for him and  he had respect for me. He said,    We are going to conduct a clean  campaign. You   ve been bruised pretty badly through the primary and the  run-off, but I am here to tell you that    may the best person win    and we  are going to run a clean campaign.    I said,    Well, that works for me  because I   m not comfortable slinging mud.    So that began my journey  into the legislature in 1986 when I was elected and started serving in  1987.  Were you the first woman to hold the seat?  Actually Judge Miles-LaGrange  of Oklahoma City  and I were the first  African American females to serve in the Senate.  Were you the first woman from your district though?  I was the first African American female from Tulsa.  What was your campaign strategy? What do you think gave you the  cutting edge?  Well, I have always been a strong proponent of education. That was the  key thing for me in running for the seat. I also focused on economic  development. Whatever could be achieved through the legislative  process was my platform for my area. I was able to get   which is the  greatest thing I think that has ever happened in our state   was to pass  legislation that created the OHLAP  Oklahoma Higher Learning Access   bill which provides all students statewide an opportunity to attend  college tuition free. I think it is now being called the Oklahoma Promise.  It was a struggle because there was no money in the very beginning, so  trying to convince some of the legislators,    How are we going to fund  this thing?    and    I don   t know if that   s a good idea.    But the one thing  that I would not give up   and we did not get it passed the first year, but  I was relentless in pursuing that avenue to make sure that our young  people had that opportunity, and it went further than just college.  It also included technical education, too, because everyone isn   t college  bound. Also I thought, suppose you go to technical school and you get  so excited about the field you   ve chosen to study that you could say,    I  might need some advance curriculum here. I need some more    umph    to  what I   ve obtained through my technical training.    I felt strongly about  the bill, and I think that came from the fact that my parents were focused  on education. Never did say more-or-less,    What are you going to major  8  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  in? What are you going to do with it?    but education, education,  education. And the fact that I grew up in a segregated community,  segregated schools, universities in the state of Oklahoma were not  accepting students   African Americans   into their universities. The  only school that we had in the state of Oklahoma, if you were going to  stay in Oklahoma, was Langston University.  Times have changed and of course there were great fighters who were  responsible for making a change. My mom always said,    No excuses  because of your race. I will not allow it. I will not allow excuses. What  has to happen is that you have to be a person who must run faster, go  faster, learn faster and do your best. That   s all I can expect of you. But I  will never allow you to make excuses for anything. If obstacles get in  your way, you get rid of them and you pull yourself up and keep  moving.     Was she present when the bill was signed?  No. In fact, my mom actually did not live to see me become a state  senator, but I know that her strength and her words were always with  me. In fact, while serving in the legislature, particularly on bills that  were controversial for some of my colleagues to vote with me, I would  just think about my dad being on one shoulder saying all kinds of crazy  stuff. Then my mom   s words were there, more gentle, saying,    You can  still do this,    and he   s saying,    Let them know their remarks are stupid.     My dad had no tolerance for stupid behavior. You could hear both their  voices bounce back and forth. But I think a combination of both is the  strength I carried with me every day as a minority in the legislature.  Was that your first major piece of legislation?  Actually, it was not. The very first bill that I became supportive of was  on human rights issues dealing with hate crimes. That was my first piece  of legislation, and I heard all the excuses. The very first bill did not have  the strong teeth or enough penalties but it was a start. Your bill may  change but my thought was,    This is step one,    and then you can always  amend legislation to make it a stronger bill to effect change.  What I did find is that when situations happen to individuals, your  colleagues will become a bit more supportive when it affects their  constituency. I   m always reminded of Freddye Williams who served in  the House of Representatives. Freddye is deceased, but I remember  Freddye   s fight for breast cancer and it was bitter. When you see things  happening now, I always think about her because we do stand on the  shoulders of people who have been there before us because it was her  plight and her fight and she was relentless. No matter what was said on  9  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  the floor, she would say,    We are going to get this done,    and she did.  That is one of the things that you learn   you don   t just give up,  particularly if you have a real passion for your advocacy.  So she was a role model?  Oh, absolutely, yes. I loved Freddye and I think we had a connection  because of her love for music and the arts and, of course, that was an  area that was very dear to me being a strong advocate for the arts. What  I didn   t say is that as a child growing up and playing the piano, my  dream was going to New York City, probably performing in a club  playing piano and singing jazz, until I got a reality check from the  counselor at Wiley College who said to me,    Well, in the event that type  of job wouldn   t come through, what would you do?    And it got me to  thinking,    So let   s talk about developing some skills as a back-up plan.     I did not get to get to New York and perform in a club, but her advice  was absolutely worthy because acquiring a skill did open up doors for  me in terms of being employed.  What did you major in then?  I majored in business, and I received an associate degree from Wiley  College. Financial problems brought me home, and I was able to get an  associate degree.    But whatever and whenever, I will get my degree.  That is my goal. That is the commitment I   m making to myself.    I have  two children, a son and a daughter, and when the empty nest happened, I  made a decision and I went on campus to Langston University and  finished my last two years on campus and did get my degree.  When was that?  That was in    80   just before I went into the legislature. The interesting  thing about that, I was in my 50   s. When I first went to class the very  first day on campus, I thought,    Well, let me try to look as casual as I  can for my age, and I am going to be in class with 17, 18-year old  students.    So when I approached the classroom some of the students  were hanging around the door and standing outside talking, this one  young man said,    Guy, get out of the way  Get out of the way for the  teacher,    and so I laughed about it. I said,    No, I   m one of you. I   m here  to be a student along with you.    I developed a great relationship with  young classmates.  I have to give a big thanks to Dr. Holloway who made it possible for me  to stay on campus in one of the adult apartments and an opportunity to  work in the library. I was always fascinated with the library anyway, so,  it was a great, great two years. It wasn   t about getting the degree for any  10  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  particular job or to enhance employment, it was a goal and that  commitment I made to myself that I would get my degree. I just did not  have the discipline to do it as a wife and mother at the time and work. I  couldn   t split myself between the work and my children. I felt if I   m  working, then I   ve got to give them quality time in the evenings and so I  am not going to take that time away from my family. And I feel good  about my decision because it was a great time I had with my kids when  they were young.  And what did they think about you being in the Senate?  Oh, it was a journey for them, especially my son. We had to work with  him. I can remember on one of the forums, it was pretty hot. I mean,  sheer attack. You have people who are not supporting you, and it was  my night to get all the blows. He was there at the forum, and of course  that   s his mom, and he just became violently ill. My husband had to just  take him home. When I got home and he said,    Why are you even doing  this? Why are you letting those people attack you? You weren   t fighting  back.    I said,    No, you missed it because I was fighting back, but I was  fighting in a way that was comfortable for me because they were  throwing the ugly remarks. I was not going to do that. I think I did rise  above the fray and not allow those guys to break me down.    I had heard  over and over and over,    We must find the spot to make her lose her  cool, show the people she is not strong enough to serve in the Senate.     Mostly the men?  Yes. Yes. Yes. Mostly men. Back to your question about my son and  daughter, they began to understand. And then I said to them,    It   s not  only me that has to be in check. You guys will have to be in check as  well. You have to keep in mind you are being scrutinized as well as I  am.    So it becomes a family thing. I think one thing is very important,  having the support of your family and being able to balance your family  life and your political life.  When I first served, we did not have the time element when session  would end, so it meant we may be in session through June or later. That  all changed and of course session started at a certain time and ended at a  certain time. At five o   clock on the last Friday in May, it   s all over. And  so coming home and then putting on the mother hat and the wife hat you  learn how to balance your time. Along with that you are 24/7 with your  constituents at home who are calling on you and wanting you to come to  their events or addressing some concerns they want to discuss with you  or need your help in resolving a situation. You wear several hats.  Did you live there then when you were in session?  11  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Yes, I did. Senator Rodger Randle was Pro Tempore at the time and he  was very helpful in locating apartments and getting adjusted in  Oklahoma City. I stayed in the apartment Sunday through Thursday,  maybe sometimes Friday. My husband became a bit more flexible and  rather than come home, sometimes he   d say,    Let me drive over and  spend the weekend in Oklahoma City.    We would do some fun things  in Oklahoma City, so sometimes that kind of balanced out.  Tell me a little bit about swearing-in day, the first one.  That was very, very, exciting. Before I went to the Capitol, Judge  Charles Owens came to Tulsa right after the general election to conduct  my swearing-in ceremony in Tulsa. I thought this was a great idea  because all the people who had worked in my campaign, friends, family  and close constituents were able to come to the Mabel B. Little House  on Greenwood, which is part of the Greenwood Cultural Center  complex. This was really special because it was sharing a really great  moment with all the people who worked with me, believed in me, gave  up their time to get me elected.  When I was sworn-in in Oklahoma City, that   s like the red carpet. You  are here with all these people and you start looking around and thinking  all these people with all this experience and,    Duh, what happens to me  now?    One thing I can say in the Senate is the assistance of your  colleagues is there, and even though you may disagree, walking you  through the process, teaching you some of the things necessary to  become an effective legislator because it is totally different but it is the  greatest honor, I think, one can have. You are one of 48 members  serving to make a difference, not only in your community but also for  the state of Oklahoma.  Are there any particular moments   defining moments   for your career,  for your time there?  One of the      Besides the first one you mentioned about the Oklahoma Higher  Learning Access Program, are there other   ?  Of course, my passion for the arts     Sure.  A professor from OU came to Tulsa and he did a book review about jazz  and he was just absolutely exciting. I knew, being from a musical  family, a lot of these artists, but when he started talking about people  12  Finchum  Horner  like Barney Kessel and Chet Baker and Oscar Pettiford and the list just  could go on and on, coming from Oklahoma. Some he mentioned I knew  because I heard these names in my home. After the lecture, I went to  him and said,    Your book review was just absolutely exciting.    I said,     We should be able to honor these people. People should know this,     and he said,    Oh, that will never happen.       Well, if it could happen  would you be willing to help me if we were able to get something done  to recognize, establish a Hall of Fame or something?    And he said,    It  will never happen.       Well, what if it does?    He said,    Well, if in fact it  happens, yes, I will agree to consult with you and help in any way I  can.     I was so excited I went to Senator Bob Cullison, President-Pro Tempore  at that time, got an appointment to talk about my idea. His desk is full of  everybody   s reports and he is looking at budgets and getting ready for  this legislative session and how we   re going to get through these budget  items, and all of the necessary things he needs to take care of, and I   m in  here talking to him about establishing a Hall of Fame for the state of  Oklahoma. He looked at me, and I said,    Well, right now, we do not  have to worry about a home for the Hall of Fame, and we do not have to  worry about money.    I said,    Would you support this? I mean, if I can  get legislation passed, would you be supportive?    And he said,    You   re  saying no money, no building,    and I said,    Not at this time.    I said,    It  has a home. It can be housed in the Greenwood Cultural Center       So  he agreed and of course legislation passed to establish a state-wide Hall  of Fame to be located in Tulsa.  We are celebrating our 20th year and we have honored many great  legends as well as educating our youth and adults, bringing attention to  our great artists all over the world, from Oklahoma. We have a wealth of  treasures that should be recognized and honored.  We remained a focus group for the first year with an emphasis on  education. Everything we were to become had to include education in  our schools. It all began at a book review   what a great idea  establishing the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame to honor and educate,  creating unity and diversity through music.  And, you did something with the page program, too?  Yes. It was my desire to recruit my pages. I know some of the legislators  preferred a letter from students. I wanted to get involved with  organizations who were working with kids who would not know  anything about the Capitol, had never made a trip to Oklahoma City,  never performed any kind of community service. So I made it a point  every year to make sure I had students coming from an environment  13  who had never visited the State Capitol.  I had a guardian angel who was very close to me in the campaign,  understood what I was trying to do who said,    Whenever you have  young people coming in as a page,    she said,    I want to have money  there for them to be able to do whatever the other youngsters are doing  through the week.    There is a planned program for them, but they get to  go shop and eat. She said,    I want them to be able to participate without  saying,    No, we will stay at the hotel.    Of course, the Senate took care  of the hotel, but you were on your own in the evenings for any of the  activities allowed. It was always supervised.  I can remember there was a young man from Bristow, but he was in a  facility here in Tulsa going through some correctional behavior. His  counselor said,    I have a young man I would love to come and be your  page,    and he said,    We will have to get clothes.    I said,    They have to  have shirt, tie, suit jacket. It doesn   t necessarily have to be a suit, but  when they are on the floor they must have a suit jacket and be dressed in  that way.    He said,    We   ll work that out.    And so the young man came  and he was a bright young man. I took him home because he did not  have a way to return to Bristow. When I reached his home, I said,    Well,  I hope you had a good week.    He said,    I did. I really have thought  about a lot of things and thought about what I would like to do, what I  would like to focus on.     And one day I was at the service station getting gas and the counselor  came up and said,    Aren   t you Senator Horner?    and I said,    Yes.    He  said,    I just wanted you to know the young man you allowed to serve as  a page for you went to college and he would like to become a lawyer.     There are many stories I could mention, but his story was a vision for me  to make sure every year I would give students this opportunity and  experience.  When I worked with one of the organizations, one of the counselors  said,    You   ve got to get prepared. You   re going to get points so that if  you get good stars and all that, then you   re going to have an opportunity  to go to the Capitol. If you fall by the wayside, you   re not going to get to  do it.    He instilled in each student to start working toward being better  people day by day to earn the right to be selected to serve as a page at  the Capitol.  I go back to the congressman and one of the things, more than  legislation, was in my district many people would never think of calling  on their legislator to try to get certain kinds of things resolved or having  difficulty getting housing or other kinds of concerns they may have. This  was something that really appealed to me. When I started with the race I  14  Finchum  Horner  wanted to educate people in my district on how you go about getting  access to getting things resolved, how to contact different agencies about  their problems. It was not all about legislation for me. It was about  educating adults and youth as well on how to utilize the political  process.  That   s great. Let   s back up just a little bit and talk a little bit about your  campaign a little more. Did you notice if the bigger obstacles were race  or age, gender or any of those?  I would say race and gender. The Senate district I served was  predominantly white. I remember when we were preparing my  brochures I was advised by one of my supporters to leave my picture off,  and I said,    Why?    and he said,    Well, I just think because you are an  African American lady, this district does not need to know this. I asked  why, and he said,    Well, I do not think it would be good for this district  to know because they may not support an African American.    I said,     Well, I find that kind of hard to believe because there was an African  American male who was in this seat.    He said,    Yeah, but they probably  didn   t even know who he was.    I said,    Well, they   re going to know this  face. Maybe the problem is they feel like they have never been served.  Maybe no one has ever knocked on their door, and I plan to do that, and  I   m not going to hide.     I go back to my mom,    I   m not going to hide who I am. They need to  know who I am because this is important. They need to know who I am,  irrespective of my skin color. I am here to serve this district.    And he  said,    Well, you are taking a big chance.    I said,    Well, it is a chance I  am going to take and I am going to knock on as many doors as I can.     I remember going to a home and this gentleman was sitting on the porch  and I said,    I would like to talk to you. I   m running for the Senate.    And  he looked up at me and said,    Are you a lawyer?    I said,    No, I am not,     He said,    Well, I don   t vote. I don   t believe in none of that stuff. People  don   t do what they say.    Oh, he took me all around the horn and he said,     I just don   t think a lady has any business being over there. You can   t  hang with those old guys. That   s the good    ole boys    club. You can   t do  that.    And he just kept saying,    can   t, can   t, can   t    and I said,    Well,  why don   t you do this? Why don   t you give me an opportunity to try?    I  said,    Why don   t I leave you some material?    And I said,    I tell you  what, this promise I   ll make to you, is that if in fact you ever need me I  want you to call the office.    He said,    Oh, yeah, right. That   s what they  all say when they   re out here trying to hustle your vote.    Oh, he went on  and on and on   and so I said,    But I   m going to leave the material,  right?    He said,    Well, do what you want.    This was a negative voice  one would not forget.  15  I don   t know exactly when, but I remember this phone call and my  assistant said,    You have a call from your district.    I made it plain to  her, too, that I want to make sure and return all calls. I do not want them  to ever feel I won   t return a call so if I   m in the office I want to always  be accessible to whoever calls me.    I wanted that clear up front because  my constituents are very important to me and I want them to know I   m  here to serve them. They put me here. I   m here to work for them.    So  she transferred the call and I heard this voice, the very voice who gave  me the third degree about why I shouldn   t be doing this, and he said,     Well, you told me to call you. I have a problem. I don   t know if there   s  anything you can do about it, but I have a problem.    I said,    Well, I  don   t know what the outcome will be, but whatever it is, let   s talk about  it and let me see if something can be done.    And it was something I  could do, which was resolved, and he called back and said,    Well, you  know what? As long as you   re running and as long as I am in your  district, you can always count on me to be a supporter of yours and you  can always put a sign in my yard when you   re running.     And so I use those two things. Of course I had many more dealings with  race, but I think it was more gender. Even in my own district men felt,     Women are taking over everything. Only men should be there.    But  you have the wonderful support of people who have gone before you  who have served, like Hannah Atkins who called me and said,     Congratulations. Let   s get together and I   ll take you to dinner when you  arrive in Oklahoma City.    She took me to dinner and shared with me  some things I might encounter as a woman in the legislature. She said,     Because the men can get together in the evenings   they can go play  dominoes and talk about legislation over dinner and certain kinds of  things that they want to see get passed. But, you know, as a woman, you  can always do breakfasts. You can always have a breakfast meeting and  you can always have a lunch meeting until you feel your way and until  you   re comfortable. In fact, if they don   t let you in the good    ole boys  club in the evening, you can always schedule those early morning  meetings and get a feel for the kinds of things that may be coming your  way.     And of course she supplied me with many other helpful things I may  encounter, like    Don   t take things personal. Step outside your box and  realize that you are serving in the legislature. It   s not Maxine, nor your  personal views necessarily. You are representing your constituency, and  you are representing the state of Oklahoma. You have to listen to  everyone and that   s an important factor. An important key is to listen;  you are a freshman, you do not have to rush and take the world by storm.  Listen. Take your time. Look at things and step by step. You will find  your way through the legislative process. Even the things you  campaigned for may not get done your first year. There is a process in  16  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  the way this thing works. So take your time. Look, listen and learn.     Do you think she told the other freshmen women that same thing?  She might have, and the fact that Judge Miles-LaGrange was already in  Oklahoma City, she probably had the opportunity to have those  conversations early on, probably even during her campaign because they  were very close as well. I think she probably knew the Judge personally  through the years. Vicki  Miles-LaGrange  had always had aspirations, I  think, of at some point to serve in the legislature. So those are the kinds  of things, though, that are very, very helpful. Of course we went through  orientation and the process is there for you but it   s always good to have  someone who has walked those steps and able to tell you how to keep  yourself in check.  Also I was fortunate to have help from Representative Don Ross and  Representative Darrell Gilbert. It was good to have someone from Tulsa  in those positions there to offer their support where they could go and  talk to their House members, or even carry your bills for you. You must  learn how to engage and connect with House members. Having that  support factor, both in the Senate and the House, is very, very important.  Did the women group together?  Yes, we did   always on Wednesday   our fun night. One of the women  I truly admired was Senator Helen Cole, a republican, and of course, I  am a democrat, and the majority of us were democrats, but she was just  the greatest and we all had fun together. One thing you learn, one may  disagree on policy issues, but at the end of the day you could get  together and really enjoy one another.  I never will forget Senator Helen Cole because the first day I carried my  first bill, she walked over and put her hand on my shoulder and said,     You   re going to be fine. It   s okay.    I think she could see that I was very  nervous. They are getting ready to call on me and I hope I don   t make a  fool of myself over this bill. But when she walked over and said,    You  are going to be fine. We all go through it. We have all had that first time.  Once you do the first time, you will become an old hat. It will get more  comfortable,    it was the fact of doing it correctly. When you have  someone come forward, like a seasoned Senator, it gives you  confidence. She gave me a wink and went back to her seat. So we really  had great respect for one another.  We were talking a little bit about socializing with women while you were  there. Were there any other obstacles once got there? You had some  when you were running, but once you got there, did you have any  17  Horner  particular troubles?  Oh. Yeah, well, mostly with the type of legislation, certainly, that I  carried. I can remember quite vividly one was the confederate flag and  one was the 1921 race riot. And on the confederate flag, Helen Arnold  was serving, I think, as secretary of state at the time, and the  Confederate flag bill was introduced to fly the flag over the Capitol and,  of course, we as a black caucus, were adamantly opposed to that  happening. So there was heated debate on the floor. It is good to learn  you have colleagues who support you for something you feel very  passionate about and can counteract some of the negatives coming from  some of your other colleagues.  And regarding the race riot, it was horrific and a violent act; that should  be known, and it was amazing to see the bill taken out of context. It was  just like the Oklahoma City bombing. It was not pretty but there is a  memorial memorializing what happened. Why couldn   t the 1921 Race  Riot be recognized? You had many people who said they never even  heard of it. They knew nothing about it. This was the whole purpose of  educating people to something that had happened. The beauty was the  people who survived were relentless in restoring the community, and so  their story needed to be told. The fact that the survivors could return and  rebuild their homes they lost, businesses they lost, with no financial  assistance from the city nor the state of Oklahoma.  Several of my white colleagues came on board supporting the  scholarship piece in the bill and economic development. But the piece  most could not support, both the House and the Senate, was reparations.  So the point I want to make, one learns to compromise to get the bill  passed and signed into law. It   s not a pretty part of our history, but many  things in history are not pretty. It was imperative for the story to be told  by the living survivors.  It was most important because the survivors were finally ready to share  their story. For many years, people would not talk about it. Not someone  else   historians coming in imagining what happened, but actually the  stories from the survivors, how they left their home, when they left their  home, how other members of the white community came in and  supported them and got them to safety. It was more than just the riot  itself. It was a whole story of the event, how it happened, how the people  bounced back and began their businesses and building their homes all  over again.  I think, in my political career the flag and the race riot were two of the  most controversial issues I was involved with. Then the confederate flag  came back around just before I retired from the legislature. I think the  18  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  saddest moment for me, in my political career, was the fact it resurfaced  and from the black caucus, I was the only member of my caucus that  was opposed to the flag being placed in the  Oklahoma  History Center.  The very people who had been adamant against it had now come, and  one of the members even authored the bill, carried the bill on the Senate  floor. Here again, you make a decision,    One has to stand up for what  you believe,    and so I have stood up against my colleague. That was one  of the saddest moments because we were one of the first states to make  sure the flag was not visible in the State of Oklahoma, and then to be a  state to fly this flag was just offensive to me. So this was the saddest  times for me, that every member of the black caucus voted for it and I  was the lonely black caucus member who opposed this offensive  legislation.  What was the outcome on the Race Riot Commission?  The legislation did pass to establish the Race Riot Commission, with  appointments to the Commission from the House, the Senate, the  Mayor   s office and the county. People were appointed from both the  Speaker of the House and the Pro Tempore to serve on that commission.  There was also a designee to some from the mayor   s office. Based upon  the recommendations from the Commission, a bill moved forward. The  bill passed, but without reparations.  There were disappointments from members who served on the  commission who felt strongly reparations should have been included in  the bill. Some members of the commission wanted to fight for  reparations. On their own a group continued to fight and is still fighting  for reparations for survivors and their descendants. The survivors are  fewer and fewer, but they have traveled to Washington and appeared  before the congressional black caucus in Washington, D.C., as well as  inviting Congresswoman Maxine Waters to Tulsa to pursue reparations  on a national level.  While we   re on that type of subject, too, do you recall the day of the  Murrah bombing?  Yes, I do. In fact, it is so vivid for me because I was traveling to Tulsa  for a funeral for one of my mentors and leading citizen of the  community.  I could not believe this was happening in our state. There were people  you knew, and you just couldn   t imagine these people were no longer  living. You just could not imagine innocent lives destroyed. I think this  is the worst feeling one could have   it was just unbelievable.  19  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  Were you chair of any of the committees that you were on?  Yes. I was proud to serve as the first female democratic caucus chair. I  was appointed by Senator Stratton Taylor who was Pro Tempore. I have  served under three leaders of the Senate   actually four, because Senator  Cal Hobson was there before I left. I chaired the Business and Labor  committee.  I served as Chair of the Business and Labor Committee along with my  Vice-Chair, a republican. This is a large committee and very important  legislation passed through this committee. The Chair reviews all bills  assigned to Business and Labor and determines the number of bills to be  heard in committee.  As chair, did you have to read a whole lot more?  As chair and member, and that is ongoing. When one would say,     You   re taking your homework in the evenings,    and I mean the bills  once they   re filed and there   s so many, and then when we became on a  time limit, you have until the last Friday of May to take care of business,  and if you are on several committees, not only are you reading, trying to  stay on top of those bills in committee, but you are trying to stay on top  of all of the other bills before they come to the floor that you are going  to vote on. This is where I say there is a need for advocates.  There is a need for lobbyists. I know some people think of lobbyists as  the dirty word, but there are those you come to know who are highly  respectful. If it is their special interest they are really pushing, they know  who I am, they know what I represent, and if it is going to be something  negative that affects my constituents I serve, then do not bring that kind  of information to me.  On the other hand, it does make you aware of some things you might  miss, even when you take all the information, take these piles and piles  of bills home to read. There might even be things you do not understand.  And so one cannot say,    I understand everything in every bill,    Also you  have these wonderful talented bright staff people who do all the research  and write most of the bills. As an example with the OHLAP bill   staff  worked with me to make sure all the language was correct.  I can remember a bill presented in committee regarding smoking     where you could smoke and could not smoke, or no smoking in  restaurants. I was on the committee when the bill was being presented,  and I did not think this is something we need to determine. I think if  people want to smoke, they ought to be able to smoke.    I was not a  smoker, but did not see why we were here discussing what people do in  20  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  their private lives, and I was not in support of the bill. When I returned  to my office I received many calls upset with my vote. I quickly learned  you have to remove yourself from your personal views and listen to all  points of views before making a decision.  Describe a typical day then   how early would you get to the Capitol and  how late would you stay?  Well, early because I am an early-riser. My time would start at 8:00 a.m.  and, of course, in the evenings was not a time limit for me because once  I was out of session, it gave me an opportunity to return phone calls or  do some needed work in the office. And so any day for me could have  been from 8:00 in the morning until 6:00 or later in the evening.  Sometimes I would plan my day around receptions, particularly when  Tulsans were the hosts. When I first went in the legislature, we could  have been there much later. I can remember an occasion where we  couldn   t come to a consensus on a vote and we were there around the  clock. That doesn   t happen anymore, but I can remember a few times  that it did happen. If you were going to get an 8:00 appointment with  someone, then I would be there at 7:00. I always wanted to make it a  point to be there before the pages, and they usually got there about 8:30,  and I always wanted to be there before they would come.  If you have pages there, then they   re going to come and they may want  to visit with you for a little while in the office or share some of the  things that they   re doing or you want to visit with them as well and see  how they   re doing. And speaking of them again is that, I always made it  a point that when I had pages over, that I would take them out to dinner.  I would spend an evening with them, and I always tried to take them to a  restaurant that they wouldn   t normally go to. But then I finally got kind  of smart on that because they were like,    Oh,    they would have just been  happy with a hamburger (Laughs) but my discussion with them was that,     I just would like for you to   the food may not be all that good  sometimes, maybe you   d rather have a burger, but just wanted to give  you the experience of a very nice restaurant.     If a woman came up and asked you what your opinion would be or  advice would be for her if she was thinking about running in politics,  what would you have to tell her?  Well, the very first thing that I would say is that if she is married, make  sure that the family is on board. I think that is very important, you have  got the support of your family. And then I would say    passion      and  usually I found some women who did come to the legislature came  because of a passion for change, the passion for the things you would  21  Finchum  Horner  Finchum  Horner  like to see happen or changed.  And then I would say be relentless in what you are trying to accomplish  and do not give up even if it looks dismal. It may not get passed that  year, may not get passed the next year, but you continue the fight. And I  have found that most women who have come into the legislature who  were there before me and certainly those who came after me, came with  a passion. You could tell, if their thing was education, there were things  they wanted to see changed in our public schools or there were things  they wanted to see changed in higher education or there were health  issues or there were criminal justice issues. Those would be the things  that I would say, family support, strong passion for what you believe in,  and learning how to network with your colleagues.  I would say the other thing that is very important, is    your word is  golden   . When you make a commitment to your colleagues, I would say,     Don   t make it if you can   t keep it.    If you are unsure, say,    Let me  think about it. Let me do a little research. Let me see if it is going to  negatively affect my district.     Also, stay close to your constituency and make sure you are representing  the views and issues you promised to do when elected. I would also say  keep an agenda to stay focused on achieving your campaign promises  and then it may be time to fold and let someone else step in.  Speaking of that then, did you have any final thoughts when you were  leaving office? You termed out so in your last session or as you were  packing up and going out the door?  I was absolutely ready to leave. I began to ask myself,    What else, even  if I were here, what else can I do, would I do?    And I said,    Well,  actually, I feel pretty good about this because I have done what I set out  to do. We were able to   ,    and when I say    we    I always acknowledge  my colleague Representative Don Ross. We were able to get the cultural  center expanded in our community. We had the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of  Fame. We were able to bring attention to the 1921 race riot. We were  able to see some changes in economic development through legislation  and through giving program funding to our community. So I could say,     Well done, well done good servant.    We served well and tried to  represent our constituency and their best interests.  My final question   unless you have something else you want to add   is  when history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  I think about that sometimes and I think that I would say probably my  strengths, my unconditional love for my family, and my loyalty to my  22  Finchum  Horner  friends. Those are the things I would like for one to remember. When I  met Joe Kinney, who wanted to do a bust of me, he said,    I have  followed your career and I would love to do this bust and donate it to the  Jazz Hall of Fame, because I think some of the things you have done are  wonderful and I admire your character and your strength.    He said,    I  was struck by the fact when you shook my hand and you looked into my  face, I saw your strength. That is what I want to capture in this bust is  your strength.    And I think that that goes well because a person coming  from a segregated environment being able to move through the system in  spite of obstacles, race, and accessibilities that were denied, but you had  the strength to move forward, staying focused and the strength to keep  your eye on the prize.  Well, I   m impressed. It   s been a pleasure hearing your story today.  Thank you so much.  Well, thank you. Thank you. It   s been my pleasure to be here.  ---  ---
