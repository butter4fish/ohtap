Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  My name is Tanya Finchum. This is March 26, 2007, and I am in Tulsa  interviewing Nancy Virtue Lewis and her friend, Carolyn Thompson  Taylor. This interview is part of the Women of the Oklahoma Legislature  oral history project of the Oklahoma State University Library.  And they both served in the House of Representatives. Nancy was  elected in 1981 and served two terms, right?  Yes.  And Carolyn was elected in 1984 and served four terms.  Correct.  Okay. Nancy, will say her name so we   ll recognize her voice on the tape.  So, say your name, Nancy.  Nancy.     and then     Carolyn.  Okay. I   m so glad to have you both here and be a guest in your home,  Nancy. So let   s get into the questions. From what I understand, both of  you are native Oklahomans. Is that correct?  Yes.  From Norman or     5  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Oklahoma City.  Oklahoma City, of course. And Carolyn is from Norman, right? And you  taught school before you became a politician.  Yes.  Did you always want to be a politician?  Yes.  How far back do you recall that you wanted to be one?  I don   t remember.  It just kind of happened then?  Yes.  You were a lobbyist for awhile too, right?  For the OEA.  Oklahoma Education Association   And that kind of piqued your interest in politics?  And then I ran   and then I served two terms.  Did you run against women or men?  Men.  Both times?  Yes.  And you beat them?  Yes.  That   s good. (Laughter) And was your campaign expensive? Do you  remember about how much you paid each time?  No.  I would imagine that it   s probably at least fifteen to twenty thousand  each time?  6  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  At least.  Did you do a lot of knocking on doors?  Yes.  That would be kind of tough. And I read somewhere that you had had an  apple pie and ice cream social before a campaign was to start.  Yes.  Was that something a lot of people did?  Yes.  Do you remember your first day when you were sworn in?  Yes.  What kind of feelings or thoughts were going through your head then?  Well      Nervous? Excited?  I don   t know.  I would say very nervous. Where was your office in the Capitol?  On the fifth floor.  Was that the top?  That   s the top.  And was it there all four years or did you have to move around?  I moved down to the third floor for the second term.  Which is the prime spot? Third     Fourth floor, wouldn   t that be the best spot? That   s where the Speaker   s  office is and all the leadership offices.  Did you have to share an office?  7  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  I was by myself.  Since you were from Oklahoma City, you did not have an apartment  there, you had your house?  Yes.  When you were campaigning, was your campaign manager a man or a  woman?  Woman.  Same person both times?  Me. (Laughter)  That explains why you won, I guess, right? (Laughter) How did you  and Carolyn meet?  We both taught at Norman High School      That   s the connection.      but at different times.  Yes.  We weren   t there together, but we had the same group of teacher friends.  We went out a lot together with them and then we both worked on other  people   s campaigns together as volunteers.  Yes.     especially a former friend of ours, Cleta Deatherage Mitchell, who  was in the legislature from Norman. Nancy was good friends with her.  When Nancy decided to run for office in    82, I was still teaching at  Norman High School and so she needed someone to help get her  campaign going. Since I was off for the summer, I kind of started doing  that and then when I had to go back to school in the fall, another woman,  Gretchen Harris, picked up and managed the campaign until November,  so she really had two of us.  Yes.  I helped through the summer and the other, Gretchen, helped through the  fall.  8  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  It   s a long process then   what June, July, August?  At least.  And then a little bit in the fall?  That   s right. Nancy   s district was huge. It was Moore and all of east  Norman.  East Norman and all   I had this big area, plus all of eastern Cleveland  County.  And you tried to knock on a lot of doors in each one of those sections?  She did. She was out there every day, and she got her family and all of  her friends and her Dad. Everybody met her Dad. Her Dad knocked on  so many doors and pestered everybody for his daughter.  Yeah. Yeah. (Laughter)  And I guess fundraising comes in there, too. Carolyn, were you in  charge of that as well?  Well, everybody pitched in. We had lots of events, like you mentioned,  apple pie and ice cream and hotdog cookouts at the community center.  Remember that at the Moore Community Center?  Yes.  We had a couple of things. Every time you could get a group together,  you know, that would be an opportunity, whether it was a group of  teachers or a group of     Did you have to do as much the second time around?  No.  People knew your name and your job. You had some neat ads in the  paper   the,    For the Kids,    and,    A Job Not a Title.    Can you think of  any one event during your terms that just stands out as a favorite  moment of yours?  I was the only girl in the  freshman  class. (Laughter) I   d make them go  around and take field trips and see places.  That   s right. Nancy would ask the Education Committee that she served  9  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  on, to go with her and look at schools. She would take them, wouldn   t  you, to schools in Oklahoma City.  Yes.  Hands-on.  She would talk about class size or whatever the issue was that she was  trying to get support for. She was the only one for awhile that did that.  Did they treat you any differently than they did their fellow fellows?  No.  Did you do things with them outside of the session, like in the  afternoons   for dinner?  Yes.  Were there women in the Senate at that time, too?  Yes.  Did you socialize with them much during that time?  No.  Did they just pretty much stay to themselves?  Yes.  That   s interesting. Did you dress up every day?  Yes.  I   ve asked that question to other women, and they have commented on  how cold it was in the chambers. Do you remember it being cold?  Yes.  It was freezing because the males always had suits on. We always ended  up wearing jackets or bringing sweaters, I remember, often times when  we were going to be in the chamber for a long period of time because it  was just so cold.  Yes.  10  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  I didn   t start drinking coffee until I was in the legislature   just to keep  warm. (Laughter)  Did you have any role models?  No.  What about Cleta, Nancy? Do you think she was a role model for you?  I think so.  A little bit?  Was Cleta of similar age?  Pretty close.  Yes.  Did any of the men take you under their wing and kind of show you the  ropes, or did you have to learn on your own?  I learned on my own. (Laughs)  That   s tough...  Yes.  Did you stay up late a lot reading bills?  Yes.  Nancy always did her homework, more than anybody else.  You read an awful lot. A lot of bills cross your desk from what I   ve been  hearing, two or three hundred a year or more.  At least.  That   s a lot of reading.  Yes.  Were you a speed reader?  Yes. (Laughs)  11  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  You   d just about have to be. Did you have an assistant?  No.  You did it all on your own.  Yes.  You did stay up a lot of late hours then, I   d say. And get up early and go  to bed late.  Yes.  And you earned your PhD after you were out of office?  My EdD.  EdD. And it   s from OSU?  Oklahoma State University   Yes.  And your other ones are from?  Colorado College and Oklahoma City University     and OSU.  While you were in the legislature you had a master   s at that time, right?  Yes.  And that wasn   t necessarily required   it just probably helped. Was it in  education as well?  Yes.  So that helped when you were the chair of the Education Committee?  Were you the chair of any other committees?  No.  And you were in charge of how many men then on that committee?  I don   t know.  Probably five or six or more?  At least.  12  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  And they listened to you.  They did.  Yes.  I guess before you were there though, there had been other women.  Yes.  You weren   t the first woman to be in the House. There had been a few  others, not many though.  Not many. What other women were in the legislature, Nancy, when you  were there? Do you remember? Was Maxine Kincheloe? And Linda  Larason was there with you, wasn   t she?  Yes.  There was a Sue     Sue     Milton?  Yes, Sue Milton. I forgot about her   from Oklahoma City.  She was an educator   had been in education, too, at Rose State.  That   s right. Republican. (Laughter) Yeah.  That came into play, too, which party you are with      Yeah.     so not very many.  And Betty Boyd. Did you serve with Betty Boyd?  Yes.  I thought so. I think there were maybe four or five women in the  legislature when Nancy was there.  Yes.  13  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  But not on the Education Committee.  Were you on the Education Committee both terms, the entire time?  Yes.  On Appropriations or Budget?  No.  And then after you got out of office, you married and missed your  honeymoon. I   ve been reading in the paper, where you had postponed  your honeymoon twice because legislative sessions were extended.  Yes.     and that made the news. (Laughter) I thought that was interesting, too.  (Laughter) Do you have a particular political philosophy?  No.  Just do the best you can.  Yes.  Get the facts before you make a decision.  Yes.  I think Nancy worked a lot on women   s issues and children   s issues  especially.  Yes  She spent a lot of time, of course in education, we mentioned that, but  she was very interested and made a big difference in especially  children   s healthcare. I remember one time you got all the guys to start  thinking about the dangers of smokeless tobacco among children  because a mother in her district at the time had      Yes.     had a son who had developed oral cancer because of tobacco,  smokeless tobacco, and she filed legislation regarding that and was  involved in that. After Nancy left the legislature, she worked to get a  major law passed that actually created Sooner Start, which is the  14  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  assistance the state gives to children with certain disabilities under six  years old.  Yes.      and so Nancy worked with a coalition of other healthcare  professionals once she left politics to get that law passed, which was a  major achievement.  Yes.  That   s great. And then you did something with alcohol and children.  Yes. I   ve forgotten what that was.  It was fighting for having to be at least twenty-one before you can buy it.  That   s right. Beer maybe? You and Helen Cole did that? Senator Helen  Cole from Moore, who was a major proponent of alcohol and drug abuse  and   of course, Nancy   s Dad was formerly, for many years, the director  of the Norman Alcohol and Information Center.  Yes.     which is a drug and alcohol counseling assistance program, and so I  think Nancy   s personal experience and support from her dad especially,  working with Senator Cole   again, that   s a good example of children  and healthcare types of issues that she worked on.  Yes.  Well, as the mother of a sixteen year old, thank you. (Laughter) It should  be thirty.  Yes, it should be. (Laughter)  That was very good. And I read somewhere you had opened a field  bureau so your constituents could come in and talk with you after you  were elected?  Yes.  And is that something other people do or you just decided that was  something needed to be done?  Yes.  15  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  And you shared that office with Cleta for awhile?  Yes and Cal Hobson, also, who was then a representative from our area.  Yes.  And did you have that for the four years that you worked?  Yes.  And that is unusual. I mean, it   s more of a typical thing for a  congressman to do. But I don   t think a lot of representatives or state  senators do that.  Did it get used? Did you have people come in a lot?  Yes.  That   s good. And then after you finished, it just closed? Has anyone else  since then done that?  I don   t think so. Do you Nancy?  No.  We were lucky to have some volunteers that staffed it and ran it. It was  very helpful.  You also gave back part of your salary to the school districts in your  area.  Yes.  Ten percent or something of your salary you gave back to the schools.  I think that   s right. One year there was a salary increase, and I think  Nancy donated the increase back to the local school districts.  You should have stayed in longer   doing all these good things.  (Laughter) How early in the morning did you get up and show up at your  office? Were you there by seven or eight or      Seven.  And most mornings?  16  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Yes.  Did you take lunch out or in?  Did you eat at the Capitol most of the time or did you go out? Just ate at  the Capitol?  Capitol.  Save time   and then you were there until late hours?  Yes.  Makes for a long day, doesn   t it?  Yes.  And you had evening events, too, where you had to party hop or go from  event to event?  Yes.  Events   that   s right. That   s when a lot of the work gets done.  In high heels and sore feet by the end of the day.  Yes.  Long days. Then she   d drive home to Norman where she lived.  That   s, what   about an hour?  About thirty minutes   not too bad.  Most people go from legislator to lobbyist but you went the other way  around.  Lobbyist to legislator. (Laughs)  Do you think that helped?  Yes.  I would think that it probably helped.  She knew her way around     17  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Yes.     and knew a lot of people already. It was very helpful.  So you went from educator to lobbyist to legislator back into education.  It wasn   t back at the high school level. It was at the college level.  OU.  University of Oklahoma   And at some point you got to present a proclamation for Irish American  Day   March 17th, a while back   at Kelly   s. That must be a pub or  something in      In Norman   very popular bar.  Yes.  I didn   t know you did that.  Well, you got to do some fun things.  Yes.  It   s not all work then. That would be a little bit of fun. So you and  Carolyn met prior to running and then you overlapped for one term.  Yes.  And then you  Carolyn  stayed in longer.  Yes.  Once Nancy was out, did you all stay in contact while you  Carolyn   were still in?  Yes. After she left, before she went into higher education, there was that  period where she worked with the, was it the State Medical Association,  Nancy?  Yes.  And that   s where she worked on this coalition of mental health people  and health people and to put together this lobbying effort really to get  the legislature to pass what then became Sooner Start.  Yes.  18  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  So she kind of went from lobbyist to legislator and then sort of to quasi-lobbying  into the State Medical Association while she was married to  Steve  Lewis . And so we stayed in very close contact because I was the  principle author of Sooner Start because Nancy asked me to do it.  Yes. (Laughter)  So we worked together on that after she left politics, and of course we  saw each other all the time socially and are friends still.  Yes.  We still have the same group of friends      Did you have to stand up in front of the group a lot and present your  bills   ?  Yes.     and make arguments for them?  Yes.  Was that difficult?  No.  I think after you   ve been a teacher and you   ve stood in front of a  classroom, it   s not that difficult, is it   so much?  You kind of have to debate though   if someone says something, you  have to be able to respond and pull them over to your side?  Yes.  Do you have to stand up in front a lot? I know that there are a lot of bills  that come through, but you   re not always the author. It   s the main  author that has to stand up and do most of the work, so once or twice a  month?  Well, some people do a lot more   carried more legislation or was the  principle author, more legislation than others. I think Nancy always  carried a pretty heavy load. She carried a lot of   followed a lot of bills  that her constituents wanted her to do.  Yes.  19  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Like the tobacco one.  Yes.  But then she would also do a bunch on her own, so I think she probably  was on the more heavy side of authorship in her term in the House and  was often called upon to, or volunteered to, debate other people   s bills,  too, or support them.  Yes.  She was really good at that because she   d always done her homework,  and the person that has the most knowledge of the facts usually won, and  she always did.  Yes.  And that was before computers.  That   s right.  So doing your homework would take a lot of work.  Yes.     or maybe a secretary would pull things together      There wasn   t a lot of staff then like there is now. I think we did a lot  more on our own.  Yes.  So when you say you do research, you went to the library?  Sometimes, and the Capitol. There was staff that would provide you  information if you asked for it, but no one had their own personal staff.  You shared a pool of staff. Nancy was always very close with the staff  and always had more information than anybody else did because she  either asked for it or she dug it up herself.  Yes.  You knew what questions to ask and who to ask too.  Yes.  20  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Well, that takes some training and experience. Maybe that   s from being  a schoolteacher as well     Yes.     some of those same skills carry over.  That   s right   and being a lobbyist, too. What a lobbyist does is   you  know, you   ve got to push your point of view and get people to see your  side, and since she had done both of those, she was really a very  effective legislator     as a freshman.  Were there any bills that you really pushed for that didn   t get passed?  No.  So everything you tackled you were successful at for the most part?  Yes.  I think that   s probably amazing, too.  Yes.  Not everyone can say that.  That   s where I met my husband though.  In the committee or he was serving in the      In the House.  And did you get more passed than him?  More bills passed? I don   t know. He was there a lot longer. (Laughs)  But if you did a percentage      Oh, of time? That would be interesting.  I   d be curious to see if      Well, they wanted Jim Barker ousted. Then Steve got elected Speaker.  I   ve seen that name on something before. They wanted him out, too, at  some point   a group wanted to oust him.  21  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Yes, we were involved in that, weren   t we?  Yes. (Laughter)  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  We thought it was a good thing at the time. He wasn   t the kind of leader  I think we all thought was necessary at the time.  Yes.  So we were able to persuade him to step down and then that   s when her  husband was elected Speaker.  Has there ever been a woman Speaker?  Not yet. Not yet. Nancy worked very hard. Jeri Askins would have been  the first woman Speaker in Oklahoma, but the House became majority  republican. She was the democratic leader, Speaker-elect, but then the  year she would have become Speaker, the republicans took control and  so she didn   t get to be. She would have been.  Yes.  Nancy raised lots of money for her and did lots of work and      Yes.     to get Jeri to that point, and it probably helped her actually in the     now become lieutenant governor because of a lot of the efforts that she  put into trying to become Speaker.  Yes.  They have to start somewhere, so you may have had a finger in that.  Yes.  You did.  And then one of you, I don   t remember which one, were pushing for  changing the terminology in the House rules to be gender-neutral.  Oh, (Laughs) I did.  That was you. (Laughter)  22  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Yes.  Did it work?  It worked. That was kind of a crazy day.  Yeah, the quote I had read somewhere about someone   Monks?  John Monks. Do you remember him, Nancy?  Yes.  From Muskogee? He always thought the Communists were coming to  take over. That was always his line. When Nancy was trying to get her  tobacco thing done or raise the alcohol limit, John Monks would always  stand up and say,    That   s the first thing the Communists do when they  come in and take over.     Yes. (Laughter)  But he got all over me for the gender-neutral language.  Feminist.  Feminist, yes.  There are different definitions for feminist.  That   s true.  The quote they had him saying was something about    panty-waist           don   t make a panty-waist.        Panty-waist      oh, I forgot that.  I probably should edit that out, shouldn   t I? (Laughter)  That   s funny though. I forgot that was      Was he there when you were in, too?  Yes.  I think it   s probably fair to say John Monks and Nancy didn   t see eye-to-eye  on very many things?  23  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  No.  Well, did he last very long in the legislature?  No.  I don   t think so.  A term or two and then he was out? Well, you chose to leave. You didn   t  run and not get re-elected. You just chose to not run again, correct?  Yes. I served two terms and then, you know, left and      Married Steve.  Yes.  That   s a good reason to leave.  Was that the reason you did leave or were you just tired and wanted a  new challenge?  Maybe both.  Yes.  Did you start your EdD program pretty soon?  EdD, Yes.     pretty soon after that?  I married Steve and then, you know, I was living in Shawnee   Oklahoma  and we were constantly going back and forth, back and  forth up to Stillwater  Oklahoma . Then we moved up here  Tulsa,  Oklahoma . Then I was going back and forth, back and forth.  You kept the turnpike hot. And the EdD is in education?  Higher education.  Higher education administration?  Yes.  That was before    The Bus    so     24  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Before Bob?  Yes.  The Big Orange Bus.  Nancy and I took some classes together in Stillwater. We both were  working and finishing our degrees at the same time so we   d ride over  together and back     Yes.     another way we stayed friends.  And good friends.  Yes.  A lot of common threads      Ate at the Golden Corral too many times in Stillwater, didn   t we   in  between classes?  Yes.  Laughter   There was a Golden Corral?  I think it   s called a Golden Corral   or it   s like that   a Western Sizzlin  or      There was a Western Sizzlin. It burned back in    96 I think and they  didn   t re-build.  Oh, shoot. (Laughs) It was probably a good thing. (Laughs)  Western Sizzlin's are okay.  Good salad bar. That   s what we had.  So you   ve been busy since then.  Yes.  You didn   t just retire after you got out and you were young when you  went in, too.  25  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Yes.  You were in your early thirties when you went in?  Yes.  And you ran against a man. Was he an older person?  Yes.  Was that David Hopper?  Yes.  He was probably in his late   what do you think? Late thirties, early  forties? Not a lot older.  So there wasn   t an age difference, just maybe gender or maybe just  because you knew more.  She worked harder. I don   t think that district had ever elected a woman  until Nancy came along.  It was a new district. It was kind of like they pieced it together. It was  Moore, Norman and eastern Cleveland County. It was a new district.  What was the biggest town then, Moore?  Part of Moore, about a third of Moore, a third of Norman and then a  third kind of a rural area. So      But a third of Norman   would that include the campus?  No.  No, that was my part. She had along the eastern side. That   s the  reason   do you want to tell her   for the yard sign, the colors that she  picked?  I picked orange from Norman and blue for Moore, so that   s why      That   s why the signs were multiple colors. The school   s colors.  Yes.  And it looks good. It shows up good. Almost glows in the dark, too,  26  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  doesn   t it?  It does. (Laughter)  So what was the toughest part of being in the legislature? Having to  read so much?  Yes.  Or was it having to campaign too much instead of being able to allot  your time to getting things done?  Yes.  Just a lot of demands on your time.  So a four-year term would do better than a two-year, wouldn   t it?  Four years. I served two terms and then I left and      Married and got an EdD and moved to Tulsa?  Yes.  Became a vice-president at OU  University of Oklahoma  in Tulsa.  We moved to Tulsa. My husband got defeated in the governor and  senate races and then was appointed U.S. Attorney up here and so that   s  how we got to be here.  When he was running for governor, did you help with the campaign?  Yes.  Did you help with fundraising or knocking on doors?  No.  Nancy went and did a lot of speaking. When Steve couldn   t be  everywhere he needed to be, Nancy would go and talk for him a lot of  places.  Yes.  Well, that was a busy time, too.  27  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  The two of them covered the state as much as they could.  We lost both the governor   s race and the senate race.  But you worked really hard in both campaigns.  Yes.     a major, key part of the campaign team Nancy led. In fact that   s what  brought them to Tulsa after both those campaigns.  Is he a republican or a democrat?  He   s a democrat.  And you   re a democrat?  I   m a democrat. (Laughter)  And she   s from a long history of democrats. Her parents are both very  politically active.  Well that may be where you got your early interest in politics then, from  your parents.  Yes.  What did you teach?  I taught government.  And then, did you teach at UCO  University of Central Oklahoma ,  Nancy   or   I thought you taught at Edmond or OCU  Oklahoma City  University    public policy some   somewhere along the way.  I don   t know.  I don   t remember where you did that.  So you   ve always had your finger in politics in some form or another.  Yes.  Nancy stayed very active in a volunteer role. She   s the head of the Tulsa  Library Board, or she was.  28  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  I   m still on the library board.  On the library commission, that   s right   Tulsa Library Commission and  the Oklahoma Foundations for Excellence Board of Directors     Yes.     and just helping recruit candidates to run for office, especially  women. I think she   s spent a lot of time doing that.  Yes.  Have any of your recruits run?  What   s your former student, Nancy, that   s in the legislature now?  Oh, Jeannie McDaniel.  Jeannie McDaniel.  I   ve seen that name   she   s still in, right?  Nancy was her teacher at one point.  Yes.  So you still have an influence. That   s good. You   re friends with Cleta, do  you still stay in touch with her at all?  No.  She lives in Washington, D.C. now. You probably see Penny quite a bit,  don   t you? Senator Penny Williams from Tulsa, we run into her a lot and  stayed in touch with her and      Yes.  Did she serve about the same time?  Yes.  She was in the House with us actually.  Yes.     and then she moved over to the Senate and then Senator Maxine  29  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Horner     Yes.  Nancy   s worked a lot with on Tulsa-related issues.  Besides the two-year and the four-year, what   s the other reason people  would switch from the House to the Senate?  Mainly the four-year term.  Yes.  And the Senate is half the size of the House. There are only forty-eight  of them and there are a hundred and one house members, and so it   s a  completely different environment. You have a lot more power and you  have a lot more control over issues because there are fewer senators.  You may be one of two people that handle all of education policy, where  in the House there would be ten or twelve of you, you know.  Yes.  So it   s just an attractive environment, I think, a lot of house members  feel like. You represent a bigger area, twice as big an area.  Yes.  Obviously, other than that I think, you have a better chance to move up  because there   s only forty-eight of you. Your chances of getting to be a  committee chairman or chairwoman is a much greater...  Yes.     or to be potentially leader of the Senate one day or one of the major  people on the leadership team than you do in the House.  And neither one of you chose to switch?  No. You know, the environment of the House is, I think and house  members feel this way, it   s just a lot more down to earth. It   s just a lot  more real. It   s more day to day   you know, I think probably because  you do have a shorter term.  Yes.  You stay closer in touch to your district and you have to work a lot. I  30  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  think you have to work harder in the House to get something done  because there are so many more of you. You have to get broader  support to get anything done and I think a house member would say the  House is a lot more honest in some ways than the Senate is. Maybe we  should have turned off the recorder before we told her that.  Right. (Laughter)  Senators always think they   re better than the House members     Yes.     but we don   t always agree with that. (Laughter)  But you have to co-sponsor   a bill has to have one from each      That   s right. It has to pass both the House and the Senate.  House and the Senate   so you have to be at least on speaking terms     That   s exactly right. There   s a lot of competition between the two  bodies, but you do have to have friends in both houses to get anything  done.  That   s interesting.  Nancy     another thing she used to do that was unusual at the time      she sort of showed everybody the way to get something passed in the  House it would have to go over to the Senate. A lot of times House  members pass their bills in the House and then, you know, it goes over  to the other side and they just sort of sit back and wait to see what  happens and if it passes, great, and if it doesn   t, that   s too bad. Nancy  wouldn   t do that. She would go over to the Senate and lobby them and  work as hard to get her stuff passed in the Senate      Right.     as she did in the House.  Right.  Sometimes that kind of irritated some of the senators, but that   s too bad,  that   s the way you have to get it done today. And she just didn   t rely on  chance to get something passed.  Right.  31  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  She made sure. She followed it all the way from the beginning, from the  committee and the House, all the way to the governor   s desk. And that  was very smart, and she knew to do that probably because of her days  lobbying, just because she figured out. That   s just her work ethic.  Yes.  Determination pays off.  Yes.     persistence and determination, I guess.  Yes.  And I guess that earned you respect from your colleagues, too, if they  saw all the extra steps you went to.  That   s right.  That was a good influence for women that came after you.  Yes.  You had already plowed the path as they say for.  Yes.  Do you remember your last day in office?  No.  And you   re sworn in, in November, right? But you don   t start      Until January.  So during that December people are changing guard, moving out,  moving in?  Yes.  Moving out, moving in, and you   re working with the staff to get any  bills ready to be filed. And there are lots of meetings that happen in  between that period. If you   re new, you go to some orientation sessions.  Yes.  32  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  It   s really a year-round job. People don   t realize that.  I didn   t either.  It just looks like, you know,    Oh, they   re just working from January to  May or February to May,    but      It   s the campaigning the last six months      Campaigning that you   re always into and there   s always interim work  when the legislature is not meeting, they   re not in official session. That   s  the time you have all these study sessions and hearings and, you know,  it   s just constant work and balancing.  Yes.  Well, when you write a bill, do you actually write it yourself or does  someone else that knows legalese do it?  There   s a staff that you work with that actually writes it for you.  Yes.  But you approve every word along the way, or give them a concept and  then they   ll draft something for you to look at.  So it helps if you have a law background?  It helps. I think it does help, but it   s not necessary. Neither one of us  have a law degree. It   s not a requirement, but most people in the  legislature are lawyers, you know, and I think partly that   s because they  have time to run for office. If you   re a school teacher, you   ve got to quit  your job to run for office. You see the legislature filled with occupations  where you can afford the time, insurance agents or farmers or lawyers or  people that work for themselves and business have the luxury of being  able to run.  Yes.  I hadn   t thought about it that way.  I think there are a lot more retired teachers in the legislature now, and  superintendents and people like that.  Yes.  33  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  That   s what Betty Boyd did. She retired and then ran for office      That   s right.     she was 65 when she ran.  Most women typically, studies show, run for office after they   ve raised  their family and after they   ve had whatever career they   re going to have,  then they get into politics. I think Nancy and I and Cleta were unusual in  the respect that we did that first     Yes.     and then we had our families and then we had whatever higher  education career, in Nancy   s case.  And both of you married     Politicians.     politicians.  Yes.  Do you know of other women that did? Do any come to mind?  Rebecca Hamilton   did she marry a former House leader, Nancy? I  don   t remember who that was.  This is Tape Two. Would you encourage other women to go into  politics?  Yes.  And the main reward is?  Getting elected.  Getting elected. That   s got to be a rush, just to know you won and  especially, I think you won by a large percentage each time.  Yes.  And you just should have stayed in longer.  No.  34  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  No? Four years   I guess that is long enough to be reading from seven in  the morning to seven at night.  That   s right.  That   s where I met Steve. (Laughs)  That was a good thing, too, wasn   t it. Did you finally get to go on a  honeymoon?  No.  Never did?  No.  Well, it   s time, isn   t it? (Laughs)  Yeah. You   re too busy to be on a honeymoon.  It   s amazing what makes it into the paper. That headline showed up  twice in big headlines. (Laughter)  You   ve done your homework.  Do you remember those  showing a couple of campaign ads from the  newspaper        A job not a title?     That   s a good ad.  There was one where when you told your grandmother you were going  to run for office and she said,    You   re such a nice girl. Why would you  want to do that?    (Laughter)  That was Andy Rieger. Do you remember him?  Yes.  He   s now the editor.     of the Daily Oklahoman. And you were elected during the time when  the economy had turned south     Yes.     so you had to deal with budget issues     35  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  It was very difficult; had to make some terrible cuts and raise taxes at  the same time just to keep things from falling apart, and it was political  days.  Even harder to keep money going into education     That   s right.     during that time, too, I   ll bet.     which is the largest part of the state budget. About sixty-one percent  of our budget is education, higher education, common education,  vocational education   was trying to preserve that as much as possible.  You had a big challenge going in     Yes.     and were successful at it. I noticed that they set the age limit on 3.2  beer. That   s what you had talked about earlier.  That   s right.  And at some point your opponent was James Henning and Ed Story.  Yes.  And you beat both them.  Yes.  And then you did some things with the elderly     Yes.     as well as the younger children    with Bernice Shedrick.  Yes, we worked with her a lot. She was in the Senate. She was the chair  of the Education Committee in the Senate.  Room and Board Homecare Act, you helped get that passed. So you  didn   t just focus on education. You did other things   and rural roads  and bridges?  Yes.  36  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor     you pushed for improvements of those.  She did a lot of that. A large part of her district was the rural.  Yes.     their greatest need was roads and bridges so she was a good example  of helping the needs of her district even though that wasn   t her  background.  Yes.  You listened to the people and the field office gave them another avenue  to reach you. Have I forgotten to ask anything?  No.  Do we need to cover anything?  No.  I   ve asked enough.  Yes.  Nancy, I   m going to see if those brochures are in this bag.  I would think it would have been easier being in the legislature single  with no husband and no children to take care of     Yes.  ...so your time was your time.  Yes.  I think it would be harder if you had young ones that you were trying to  go to softball games and stuff.  Yes.  You had a flashing smile    very friendly face.  That was a long time ago. (Laughs)  That was a long time ago   another life, wasn   t it? (Laughs)  37  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Anything else you want to say?  No.  Anything you want to add, Carolyn?  One last big accomplishment we haven   t talked about was when OU   University of Oklahoma       Yes.     bought what   s now called the Schusterman Campus Nancy was in  charge of moving from what was UCT  University Center at Tulsa  or  OSU  Oklahoma State University -Tulsa      Yes.     to that campus and getting it all ready.  I had   you know   Boren   I was at TCC  Tulsa Community College   and Boren  President of the University of Oklahoma  was staffing and  hiring three levels down for the UCT and then they bought that campus   Schusterman Campus . The Schusterman   s gave the money for that  campus and I had to     She was in charge of pretty much getting that campus ready to become a  university campus.  Yes.  It was what before? It was Amoco.  Yes.  It was a chemical or oil company before. The buildings   she had to get  everything turned around so it could have a library     Yes.     and be classroom ready and have faculty offices or space for all of  that, and really was in charge of all the operations. It   s a blossoming  campus. I think a lot of people over there, if you talked to them, they   d  tell you Nancy is largely responsible for a lot of that.  Yes.  38  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Must be a very good organizer then.  Yes.  She   s very meticulous; a detail-oriented woman.  Yes.  Which is what you have to do when you campaign, too, and pass  legislation.  You have to be willing to delegate.  Yes.  And she has a son named Reed.  Yes.  We haven   t talked about Reed.  He   s here. He goes to Mayo  Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma .  He   s what, ten or eleven?  Eleven.  So that explains   (Laughter) the guys here, transformers, legos. Is that a  family name, Reed?  Yes.  There   s a picture.  Reed Cowen   he   s a boy.  I shouldn   t show somebody from OSU this picture. (Laughter)  Photo  of husband Steve and son Reed dressed in University of Oklahoma  apparel   Oh, there he is. Oh my god.  He   s got your smile, too. (Laughter)  He   s a cute kid.  39  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Taylor  Oh, what a sweet little fellow.  He   s a big boy now   real tall.  And does he like to read?  Yes.  He   s a big kid now, isn   t he?  He   s eleven.  Eleven. Yeah. My daughter   s birthday is today, Abby. Nancy   s her  godmother, and so we wanted Abby to have a good role model. So I  always told Nancy she   s in charge of Abby   s values and morals.  (Laughter)  Okay. This is a good picture.  That is a good picture.  ...a very good picture.  Steve has this down at his office.  He does?  Yes.  That   s a good one.  So you need to take one that has OSU in it, too.  Yeah, that   s right.  Did Steve get any degree from OSU?  No. He got a law degree from OU.  Well, that explains the  OU photo . So he watches Bedlam  Bedlam is  the term used to describe when OU plays OSU in athletic events  with  great interest then?  (Laughter) Yes. They   re a pretty big sports family. I think they go to a  lot of events in Norman and Stillwater.  40  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  So when it comes time for college, he   ll be encouraged to go to      Where are you going to send Reed to college, Nancy?  I have no idea. (Laughter)  Wherever he wants to go. (Laughs)  OU will be high     High on his list   where his grandparents live     Yes.     good thing.  Well, it   s kind of interesting because when Steve got appointed U.S.  Attorney up here  in Tulsa , I was working at TCC  Tulsa Community  College  and was staffing and hiring three levels down so I went down  to     OU-Tulsa or UCT  University Center at Tulsa ?  And you know.  She was in charge of the OU office when UCT was a kind of mix of OU  and OSU and I understand she ran the OU part  Yes.     and then when OU separated and went over to the Schusterman  Campus, then she was the major person in charge of the transition     Yes.     to them being independent.  Come a long way from being a high school teacher.  That   s right, but stayed in education pretty much all the way.  Yes.  It   s been the thread in her life    children and women   s issues.  Anything else we need to add?  41  Lewis  Taylor  Finchum  Lewis  Taylor  No.  No.  Well, thank you very much.  Okay.  Sure.  ------- -------  42  Oklahoma State University Library  Women of the Oklahoma Legislature Oral History Project     a conversation about Nancy Virtue Lewis  In this interview, Carolyn Thompson Taylor reflects about her friend, Nancy Lewis.  This interview took place on May 9, 2007 in Tulsa, Oklahoma with Tanya Finchum.  Finchum  Taylor  This is Tanya Finchum. I   m here with Carolyn Thompson Taylor, and  we   re at the OSU-Tulsa Library, and this is May 9, 2007, and we   re  going to talk a little bit about her friendship with Nancy Virtue Lewis. If  memory serves me correctly, Nancy was in the House from 1982 to  1984, which is an overlap with yours. Can you tell me a little bit about  memories concerning her?  Sure. Nancy actually asked me to be her campaign manager in 1982  when she first ran for office. I was still a teacher at Norman High School  then, and so I really learned from her how to run a campaign. She had  been a volunteer for other, lots of other campaigns, including Cleta  Deatherage Mitchell   s and had learned about how the campaign part  worked. She needed a campaign manager and I was a teacher and I had  the summer off, so she showed me how to do all that, which later helped  me know how to run my own race when I decided to run for office. She  taught me a lot about the campaign process and what you have to do to  get elected. I don   t know that I could have gotten elected had I not had  that experience and learned from her about what all it takes.  Once I was elected and she had already been in the House for two years,  I learned a lot from her in terms of how to make sure your legislation  passes and ultimately becomes a law. She was very adept at the  legislative process, and I think the thing that I learned from her that she  did that was different than most of the other people there is, at the time,  most people I think really just sort of looked at their little part of the  process, you know. They would defend their bill in committee and then  defend it on the House floor and then sort of drop it   whatever happens  when it goes to the Senate or down to the Governor   s office happens.  She really was one that followed it all the way through. Whatever she  was passionate about, she would make sure it passed in committee and  then would do what she had to do to make sure it passed in the House.  Then she would go over to the other side of the Capitol, the Senate side,  and work it over there and make sure it passed. Then she would go down  to the second floor to the Governor   s office and she   d make sure  everybody down there was for it, and I think she showed us how to do  that, and that was very helpful. I think she broke new ground in a lot of  ways doing that. She made a lot of people mad doing that because  43  Finchum  Taylor  senators don   t like House members coming over messing in their  business. But that   s what you have to do to get something into law that  may be a particularly difficult issue or controversial issue or complicated  issue. She would be there to explain it and push it, and maybe that came  also because of her background.  Before she ran for the legislature, she was a lobbyist for the Oklahoma  Education Association, and so it was her job to follow a bill all the way  through the process as a lobbyist. She really never lost that lobbying way  of doing things when she became a representative. It was very valuable  to her because things got done that she cared about because she knew  her way around the Capitol. She knew how things worked in Oklahoma  City and I think I learned a lot from her.  She also was very passionate about women in politics, and I   ve watched  her for many years recruit women to run for office and actually help  them get elected and raise money for them. She was very involved in  helping get Jeri Askins elected, the first woman Speaker in Oklahoma     which didn   t happen because the republicans took over the House, Had  the democrats stayed in control, Jeri Askins would have been our first  woman Speaker and Nancy was behind the scenes all the way to make  that happen. Of course, Jeri, today, is our lieutenant governor and so  probably a lot of the groundwork laid for her being Speaker and the  money raised for that was helpful to her in her lieutenant governor   s  race.  Nancy always cared about more women in politics and helped mentor all  of us. She would regularly try to get us all together as a women   s group  or women   s caucus and have lunch together, or breakfast together. She  thought that was important and organized all that. She always saw the  social value of it all as well as the political value, and she was just a real  trailblazer in lots of different ways.  Did you do any bills together?  Oh sure. We did lots of bills together. Of course, we both represented  different parts of Norman so whatever Norman needed, they would  come to us and we would co-sponsor it, usually together   or what OU   University of Oklahoma  needed or the Moore-Norman Vo-Tech  School needed or the Norman business community needed, you know     we would always do it together.  After she left politics and she was involved in some social service  agencies and would come and ask me to sponsor bills that they needed  done, and that   s how Sooner Start became law. The Sooner Start is a  multi-agency effort that provides care for children with certain  44  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  disabilities in Oklahoma from age three to six, and she really was the  one that got all the agencies to agree on a plan and what needed to be  done. She pulled together the Department of Mental Health, the  Department of Health, the Department of Education and spent two years  really working with all those agencies to lay out a service plan. Then she  came and asked me to sponsor the legislation that would create that  program and fund it. Now it   s a multi-million dollar program in  Oklahoma that serves thousands of children and has become a role  model around the country. We were the first state to do that, and now  many states have copied that legislation, and Nancy did that.  Did she do anything else that comes to mind, as     She was one of the first representatives and senators to really focus on a  health issue in Oklahoma that at the time was controversial. She tried to,  and did, warn everybody of the dangers of smokeless tobacco and the  health hazards, especially use by children or young adults, and worked  hard to pass legislation providing an age limit on that. You know, in  rural Oklahoma and in many parts of Oklahoma, it wasn   t a popular  thing to talk about or to try and get government to do, bring up  the      That   s not something government should do,    kind of argument  and      That   s a personal decision,    argument. And, she really just got  everybody on board behind that, and it was amazing how she did it.  Do you have any favorite memories, special memories, funny memories  or stories     Oh, she loved campaigning and she taught us all how to campaign and  knock doors. Her whole family was involved in all of her races, and then  she helped all of us get elected, and I think those are some of my fondest  memories of her.  So she would have been sworn in at the same time     Yes, 1984 we would have been sworn in together and in 1986   no, I  guess just 1984. That would have been the only time, and that was a neat  thing   getting to be sworn in next to my best friend at the time  together   two women, two young women from Norman   single women  from Norman, you know. At the time, it was unusual. Both former  teachers and      A lot of similarities.  A lot of similarities in our background.  And then when she got out and you got out, you still stayed in touch?  45  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  We still stayed in touch, and we are still very good friends today. We did  a lot of things together when we both left politics, in terms of giving  advice to candidates and helping people get elected, and then for many  years, we did Girls State together. We would go down and be counselors  together for that experience for high school students, and counseled  them and showed them how the legislative process works, and we did  lots of speaking things together and     She was in a higher education, too?  She was. We actually worked together at UCT  University Center at  Tulsa  at the time. She worked for OU  University of Oklahoma  for  many years here  in Tulsa . Before OU moved to its present location at  the Schusterman Campus, we got to work here together when it was the  University Center at Tulsa.  Do you remember much about her last day in office?  No        did you help her make the transition?  No. I think it was an emotional, bittersweet day for both of us, her  leaving   but it was a happy day, too, because she was ready to move on.  She had gotten married, and they were gonna move. I was happy for her  that she had found somebody that she cared deeply about, and I knew  she   d always be happy     Was he in politics?  He was in politics, too. He was in the House and later became Speaker  and then later ran for governor, Steve Lewis   and she was heavily  involved in all of his campaigns.  And you married someone in politics?  Yes, we both married somebody in politics. Our lives are parallel in  many ways   but she always did everything first. She ran for office first.  She got married first. (Laughed) She moved into higher education first,  and so I always just joke with her that, you know, my life was easy. I  just did whatever she did two years later. (Laughs)  Is there anything else you would like to add to the record?  I don   t think so. Thank you.  46  Finchum  Okay. Thank you very much.  ------- -------
