Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library, and we   re doing an oral history project called,    Women of the  Oklahoma Legislature,    and we   re with Mina Hibdon today in Norman,  Oklahoma at the public library, and it   s May 2, 2007. Thanks so much  for joining us today.  Thank you.  Okay.  My pleasure.  Give us a little bit of information about your background. Where were  you born, did you have siblings, and what your hometown was like?  I was born in southeastern Oklahoma in McAlester on a farm. My  grandfather was a doctor, my mother was a nurse and both participated  in my birth. I was the last of eight children and grew up on the farm  where we had goats. At that time goat milk was very popular. We drank  goat milk, and I remember playing with the goats, and they would butt  you. They never really became your friend because if you turned around,  the little goat might butt you around. McAlester is the home of the  Oklahoma State Prison, and we used to think   and maybe our parents  put this in my mind, that when there was an execution the lights would  dim and it was, we felt, a sad time. But I   m not sure that really  happened. We lived very near the prison, which is truly a beautiful part  of the state.  As I grew up, and because I was much younger than my brothers and  sisters, pretty much playing by myself. In those days, we had barns  around the farm and it was wonderful to go out in the barns and see the  5  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  stray cats and other animals, but mostly cats. We were not too far from  the railroad tracks and often people would come out to the first railroad  crossing and dump their cats or their dogs   and we got them, and of  course we had plenty of milk. In those days, the houses were so  constructed that you could go under the house very easily. So we had  many dogs and many cats living under the house that drank lots of goat  milk, and I had lots of playmates because there was no one around for  me to play with. My oldest sister was ten years older. I can remember  my playhouse was a dirt floor in one of the barns with one of the wild  cats or other animals that I would play with.  What was school like?  School was a long walk and, as they say,    The longer you live, the  farther you walked.    School was Sixth Ward. My grandfather was a  doctor and my father was a teacher and I walked alone, quietly, on an  old country road to school, which at the time seemed a long way. But  I   ve since gone back in the car, and it wasn   t very far at all   but coming  home, I would have to face the north. The wind would be very, very  cold, and I seemed to never have enough clothes, and I used to think,     Well, my parents took better care of the little farm animals than I.     They would bring them in, in the wintertime and put them behind a  wood stove. They put them in a box when they were first born so that  they would be warm. I would play with them at night, but we had a lot  of animals behind the old wooden stove. We used to keep the animals,  soon after they were born and in the cold winters   we kept them night  and day, and my mother and I would mostly take them out when  possible during the day for their exercise.  In your school, how many children may have been in your class, in your  age group?  Maybe twenty.  That   s a pretty good number. How early on did you get interested in  politics?  Not until it was announced that I would run for office.  And how did that happen?  My children and my husband, who is professor of Economics at OU   University of Oklahoma , were on a vacation here in one of the state  lodges and we took a couple of their playmates. In those days you did  not travel very far, at least we never thought of going anywhere other  than staying in the State of Oklahoma for our vacation for several  6  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  reasons   sometimes because of money, sometimes because of time. So  on this vacation, I got up one morning, opened the Daily Oklahoman,  which is the major newspaper, and on the front page it told of the death  of the state senator where I lived   and I was shocked. I read, I was  puzzled and I was sorrowful because I knew his wife very well but I did  not know him as well. And as I read the article, my name was mentioned  as a possible candidate to go into that senate seat. I thought      Now  that   s very strange. Wonder where they got that idea and from whom?    I  read on and I showed it to Jim  her husband  and we just kind sighed and  thought,       really?    And things began to move from there on quite  quickly   very quickly because he died near the end of his term, so you  had to file very quickly and go to work campaigning.  Did you ever find out who suggested your name?  Yes, the local banker. There were three banks in Norman at that time. In  two of the banks, the CEO   s were democrats. In the third bank, the CEO  was a republican. So it was the republican CEO of that bank in Norman  who started working on things and getting together a committee. I was  not back in town yet from vacation and he had things going. When he  did reach me, since there were no cell phones back then, we met on a  Sunday with about fifteen other people at a home. They already had  plans for me to run for the senate seat. Well, as it turned out, the house  of representative young man decided to step over in the senate seat and  filed there, so that stopped me from going into the Senate. Instead, I took  his seat in the House of Representatives where he had been some years  and, of course, he being a democrat, there was no problem for him, but I  being a republican, we foresaw lots of problems, and there were many,  many problems when I filed as a republican, the very first in anything  political in Cleveland County.  And first woman as well?  The first woman and that was an anomaly. Voters just didn   t know what  to think and we all felt that it just will not work. And well, work it did,  and I went down three dress sizes going door to door meeting people,  which I loved. Molly Griffis wanted me to do a book with her because I  have so many stories of happenings going door to door. For instance,  I   m going door to door and I meet a woman who comes to the street and  she tells me I should not be running because I   m a woman, and the Lord  did not want a woman in politics and why am I running?    Shouldn   t you  be home taking care of your children?    And I answered all her questions  as best I could but of course she was not convinced. She was just  shocked to think that a woman, not particularly any party affiliation, but  that I would leave the home, kitchen, and sink and run for a political  office.  7  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  You surprised her by winning, too, I   ll bet?  Very much so.  How much was your campaign budget for that first time around?  Very small, maybe  25,000.  Did that increase each time you ran?  Each time   three times.  And did you do the same type of campaign each time, knocking on doors  and walking around?  Each time walking door to door and the dimension of shaking hands was  very important. In fact, I shook so many hands I got tennis elbow and  the doctor had to put the right arm in a sling, which really looked like,     Oh the poor thing.    (Laughs) But it kept me from shaking hands and  from getting the tennis elbow, but I liked the dimension of shaking  hands, and people were surprised   very surprised to see me at the door.  I didn   t get a lot of publicity at first, and then it began to hit the papers  that,    Here   s this woman running and she   s working hard,    and then the  ball really started rolling.  Lots of things happened, and I loved the people, and I kind of made up  my own rules about going door to door which, since those years, I have  advised other candidates the things you do and the things you don   t do  when you   re going door to door, particularly, leave the dogs alone.  Learn how to face the dogs. Be very careful because one morning going  door to door, a dog kept me on the porch until the postman came and  freed me. The dog was not going to let me off his porch. So that   s just  one of the happenings that came about that was so interesting, and so I  do teach the young candidates nowadays about going door to door.  Do you have a favorite memory from campaigning   I mean, one that  immediately comes to the surface?  No, other than the woman that met me in the street and we chatted a  long time, but she really wasn   t listening. I was invited many, many  places and met many, many people, which I enjoyed. My children and  my husband were cooperative and took over household duties. One child  older than the other, Jennifer, took care of the younger one, and that  child   that was my babysitter. She stayed in politics, not running for  office, but stayed in politics with a senator and moved on to Washington  and was also with a governor here in Oklahoma. But she went on to  8  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Washington with a senator and she   s very astute in politics. Somehow it  rubbed off on her. With the other child, I was just Mom, no big deal.  That   s okay, too. What was your first day in office like?  Lots of cameras, and Judge Lavender of the supreme court did the  swearing-in. I really didn   t know what was coming or what. I had  worked so hard going door to door, that   s all I did. I was pretty much left  alone, though there were forums to attend where I was asked,    What do  you think about this? What do you think about that?    But the very first  day in the House chambers, I was sworn in by Judge Lavender of the  supreme court here in Oklahoma.  Any particular thoughts going through your head?  I had no idea of coming events.  Not nervous or     I didn   t know what was coming.  Your whole family was there, I   m assuming?  Yes, and I had really no other family. I guess the rest of my family were  democrats. (Laughs) They weren   t that excited about   and finding out  that,    Say, Mina   s a republican, really? From McAlester?    I think there  were two of us in town in McAlester that were republicans.  Did you rent a place to stay or did you go back and forth each     Went back and forth every day.  Every day?  I lived in Norman, and I never thought of the commute then. It was not  interstate, and sessions began at 10:00am. I had a very cooperative  family. I got my children to school, and that really was not a difficult  time. I often was not home evenings. Had lots of invitations and  sometimes my husband was invited, and when we   d walk into a room,  their hand would go to my husband   s first and he would say,    No. She is  the representative.    And I would see that startled look in their eye that  they had not read or heard about me as yet, though everybody in this part  of the state pretty much knew about me and, of course, my hometown. I  was on the front page there.  How many other women were in the House at that time?  9  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Hannah Atkins had been there not very long, and there was one more  from Tonkawa.  So just three of you.  So I was the third one.  In the Senate?  I don   t think anybody in the Senate.  So just three women?  Three women.  Did you have to share an office?  No. I had my own office, a private secretary of my choice, and on the  republican side.  Go ahead while we   re here.  I had bills that I presented in whatever committee that bill should be in,  and I would explain the bill in full meaning, what it would do, but I  never got them out of committee. It was very partisan. They would not  pass out of committee - the majority were democrats, so I had no choice  but to accept that answer. So I was not able to do the things I wanted to  do. But I soon got into things as I talked to people and learned about the  needs of Cleveland County, and I represented the major part of Norman  and the University  University of Oklahoma , but they would not accept  me as a republican. Members were very blatant about not accepting my  legislation. I did get some things out of the committee, but very little.  Do you think it was more because you were a republican than a female?  Both. Partisan democrats were the majority.They really didn   t like me.  They just didn   t think a woman at that time     Did the other two have similar difficulties?  It was a little better for them, and for the democrat representative, very  easy. For the other republican lady, it was a little better for her. But I  was given a comeuppance,    You?    And I had so much publicity at that  time because there was just nobody in Cleveland County, anything south  of Interstate 35, as we know Interstate 35 now, and I couldn   t overcome  that. There was nothing I could do.  10  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  In any of the terms or in your first term in particular   your second  term?  No. It got no better.  Didn   t get any better?  It got harder, harder and harder. The campaigns became harder. Each  person running against me received more and more money than I     much more, and couldn   t overcome that. There, people were not  contributing as they do now. And now, of course, is entirely different.  The media, the postal cards, the telephoning     You did a lot more     A lot more.  Did you have a slogan?  No, I didn   t. I had very clever bumper stickers with a pretty little flower  over my    I    in my name   M-I-N-A and for that dot over the    I    I had a  little yellow flower there that was feminine, but no slogans. I didn   t have  a slogan then. That   s a long time ago. My, how things have changed.  They have a little. Some people still have them. Do you have a political  philosophy?  Well, I   m not sure what I would want to say on a philosophy.  Okay, we can come back in a little while. When you went into office,  what were you hoping to get accomplished?  Had nothing in mind     Nothing in mind?     absolutely nothing. It was   it was very quick, as I said. The death and  the filing time of the senator were very quick. The main thing was this  banker got together with others and they were just focused on getting me  elected. They worked very, very hard and they felt it just couldn   t be  done. But if anybody could do it, I could because I was well known.  Back then, I was PTA president, I attended church regularly and was  active in church, active in schools, and a professional volunteer. I was  known by name, only not really by face, because often people didn   t see  my face but I loved being with people and I loved volunteering, and I  still do an awful lot of volunteering.  11  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  You did that more once you were out of office   you went back to  volunteering at the Salvation Army?  Salvation Army   I   ve been on that board. I don   t think you can get off  of it once you get on it. I have been on the Salvation Army board  because of the wonderful deeds that the Salvation Army does and the  fact that in it   s hundred and something years, there   s never been a  scandal   never been any question about those that give and work for the  Salvation Army.  I also am a hospice volunteer. I do respite work. Many people say,    Oh,  Mina, how can you do that?    Well, I don   t have any problem with the  person that   s dying. By that, I mean I   m saddened but it doesn   t keep me  away from sitting by the bed, and maybe they want to be read from the  Reader   s Digest or read from the Bible   whatever their needs are as I sit  by the bed or just hold their hand and be quiet, and I have no problem  with that. And I work with foster children   not hands-on. I helped work  on a grant in Norman   s Cleveland County to get money for foster  children. There   s so many nowadays. Abused children are taken out of  homes in the middle of the night. Say a young baby is taken out of a  home somewhere in Cleveland County in the middle of the night  because of the abuse, whatever it is and the number, the problem trickles  down to me eventually. I have a number and they call me and say,    We  have this baby.    I   m given all the information about the baby, the needs  and I buy what that baby needs, from a bed to diapers. And of course  I   m very active in my church and I do other things whenever called  upon. I just love being a volunteer. Being a volunteer is like throwing a  piece of bread on the water and it comes back to you toasted and  buttered and ready to eat. It   s so rewarding.  Would you encourage women today to get into politics today?  I would. Of course, I wasn   t prepared and it was tough for me, though I  remained,    me    all during it, you have to. I think the women nowadays  are far better prepared and have been encouraged to run and they   re  qualified. I didn   t know it though, but I became qualified quite quickly.  But nowadays, the women certainly should and use their wonderful  talents and their wonderful faith in their government, whatever side they  believe in, and get in there and work and just do the best they can. They  will love it.  I had read somewhere where you had quoted,    My life would be much  more pleasant if I didn   t create waves of turbulence.    Do you remember  saying that?  No, I don   t.  12  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Back in 1974, a long time ago.  That memory has faded. It might have been on a forum     Could have been.     that we had held in one of the universities OCCE  Oklahoma College  of Continuing Education  when I talked about in some cases abuse from  a man or a woman that it would be alright with me if they were flogged.  Well, that probably shocked the world because I had seen what would  happen and how a life can be destroyed so,    Let   s flog them.     I can see how that could cause some trouble.  Yes, that   that really caused a lot of problems.  And I had read that you favored ERA. Was that a big deal at that time?  At that time. The women that worked for that were not of my party and  because the republican party, being conservative, felt that some parts of  the Equal Rights Amendment would not be the right thing for a woman,  but the part   and I studied it, though I felt it would never be completely  adopted by every state in our republic. I felt at that time that was the  thing to do. I understand today, 2007, they   re thinking about bringing  the amendment back. It has to be ratified by every state. I don   t think  that will ever happen.  It   ll be a long time if it does, I think. Who was your campaign manager?  Didn   t have one.  Didn   t have one? Not either time?  No, we didn   t     You didn   t need one.  I didn   t need one. To me, I just felt campaigning needed to be door to  door, what I loved to do. I would start at 9:00 in the morning with a  thermos, with a sandwich, and come home at 5:00 in the afternoon after  going door to door.  All summer long?  All summer. Each time it   s in the heat of the summer, and Oklahoma can  be so hot. So if you want to go down three dress sizes, leave at 9:00am  at the middle of summer and come back at 5:00pm. (Laughs) You will  13  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  soon work whatever it is you want to work off.  Once you were in office, can you describe a typical day? What time  would you get up and what would you do during the course of the day?  Well, I was an early morning riser, never was ill. I did miss   leave a  session, which caused a really big flap, but I would do my homework in  the mornings, housework that needed to be done, and my husband was  very cooperative. He rode his bike to school. We only had one car, and  my children would go to school. We didn   t have to walk to the corner  with them in those days, and it was two blocks from school, and so I  would get the young one to school. The other one would meet a friend  and walk to junior high as we called it, or high school. I had a very  cooperative husband. He never lost weight, so I guess I cooked and fed  him well.  And then once you got to the Capitol, what did you do?  Well, usually I would meet the doctor of the day and introduce myself,  and then I would go into my office. I had lots of mail. I had so much  mail and such a good secretary, and I had to spend a lot of time reading  every letter   some were kind, some were unkind. I also looked over the  bills that were to be presented that day, and once again being  discouraged because I had presented a bill to be in a certain committee  and knowing that I was going to be disappointed once again.  Did you have a mentor?  Not really, other than the older representatives that would advise me and  encourage me. And though I didn   t get very discouraged, I was told  early what it would be like by the other representatives, but each partisan  group are very, very close to each other and stick up for each other and  vote for each other   s bills, but not for me. In our committee, there were  few republicans so I did not have enough to overcome the votes to keep  that bill in committee.  Did you socialize with them outside of normal work days?  With republicans, I did   yes. We had lots of invitations, and Norman  particularly was a great place to be from because lots of things going on  at the university. I had so many invitations, so many dinners, and so  many things that were very frivolous   some of them were, but you   ve  got to be there. They   re looking for you, and so my appointment  calendar was always full. I seldom had time to stay home. You just had  to go to everything in town, and particularly in Norman it   s a university  town, are always busy and they want you there.  14  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  And they still do probably.  Still do.  Still do. I read, too, that you had proposed bills to eliminate reference to  gender?  Yes.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?  Well, I   m trying to remember. There were so many,    Him, him, him,  male, male, male,    and that went over great. That bill changed the  wording in many, many legislation from    him    to both or to either    him  or her    and     Less specific or whatever     I was trying to think of the word I used. That was very popular   was a  lot of work done about that and that was a big change and a very good  change. It just made things read better in the books of the legislature,  and there were many of them, but until that time it was all male, and  wrong.  What prompted you to start that?  Well, in reading and studying, I thought, well, this is not quite right now  because we have some women and we   re left out of everything in the  legislative libraries   all legislative write-ups, all legislative biographies,  all legislative bills. I thought maybe this would be a good thing to do. So  I changed all of that which was a big job for the legislative libraries to  take over, to make the changes that were needed in legislative histories.  That was the day before computers were real popular or would be easy  to change.  Oh, I know. I gave them so much work.  But it was good work.  Good work     Good work.     and I saw a young lady recently who worked in the Oklahoma state  library system, legislative library system. Last week, I monitored a test  15  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  at one of the schools here in Norman, a middle school. I monitor tests as  a volunteer, and you have certain rules and a little bit of study to do  because testing time is, of course, very important in whatever grade     and I ran into the woman who was in the legislative library at the Capitol  and she said,    I   ll never forget you,    (Laughs) because I had given the  workers so much work, but they did it and so, she lived through it and it  was good to see her again. It   s a small world.  She thanked you, too, probably?  Indeed she did.  Well, that   s great. That   s a good story out of your days there. Do you  have any more   any other bills that you...  Well, I had a bill I was successful in getting   and I don   t know what it   s  called   a large machine that   s used in hospitals to detect cancer?  MRIs or   or CAT scans or     Well, I   ve forgotten the name, but it was before those     Okay.     and I was successful in getting that big monster in one of the hospitals  here in the state that was used often in those days. Of course, it has  progressed now to great, wonderful things and so has the medicine, but I  was successful in getting the machine that would help to detect cancer.  That   s a very good thing.  That was wonderful, yes.  Do you remember your last day in office?  Yes, I do. I had very little in my office. My secretary had a lot. She had a  lot more to do than I, and of course when I left I didn   t know I wouldn   t  be back. But one of the things I do remember, to slide off of your  question a little bit, was I often talked to students who would come to  me and say,    Would you help me get into medical school,    or       in  dental school,    and they were from Norman. I had a lot of students that  did that, wanted my help and I would say,    Yes, I will help you but I  want you to bring your grades to me. I want you to tell me a lot about  yourself.    I remember one time during that, a young man wanted to be a  lawyer and I looked in the yellow pages and there were only one and a  half yellow pages of attorneys     16  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Only?  Only. Now look, page after page after page. And this young man, he  brought information to me. He proved to me that he could use my help  and that I would be helpful to him and I would be proud to help him, and  there are a couple   there   s a dentist here in town and a dermatologist  whom I helped get into the school at that time. And they went on and got  their degrees   medicine degrees. Good feeling.  Good feelings, yes. Very good. Now what was my question? (Laughs)  Let   s get back here   oh, your last day in office.  Yes, of course I didn   t know I wouldn   t be back, and so after the  election then, of course, in the county   in the city, then I went back with  my husband and children, and we moved the things in the office, and by  that time I was pretty hardened. You know what   s coming. You know  what has happened, and you know that you don   t have that money that  your opposition has, and you know where their money   s coming from  and it   s going to be a lot of money that I, as a conservative, didn   t  receive that kind of money, and that was sort of the beginning of  needing money for advertising, for the flyers they were putting out   lots  of bumper stickers. You don   t see so many bumper stickers anymore  because they   re very expensive. They weren   t then, and though we  didn   t do telephoning. I don   t know why. Why didn   t I know that? But  we didn   t, and pretty much used newspapers, and the editor of this  particular newspaper did not like me. I had a lot of criticism from him  that was unfair, but he did not want me to win again, and he was  instrumental in public opinion from a newspaper. It happens.  Has there been a woman since?  Yes.  So you broke some ground there then.  Yes, for democrats.  Democrats. No republicans     No republicans   no republicans in the Norman area. Now in Moore  area, there was one. And then there   s another one   and they   it began  to blossom so     You broke a little bit of ground.  I broke the ground. It was some years though before they finally got the  17  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  nerve to do it.  Is there anything I haven   t asked that you want me to   to be sure and  cover?  Well, no. You haven   t asked my age, but that   s okay.  You   re welcome to tell us. I always worry about that, whether to ask or  not.  Do you really? I   I guess   well, because I   m eighty-one.  And you were how old when you ran then?  In the forties.  In the forties, about my age.  Brown hair, the color of yours. I   m totally white now. (Laughs) I   m not  sure what caused that other than maybe my genes, but I always had very  brown hair and   was a wonderful experience. It was tough. I held up  well and I encourage women to run.  So you would do it all over again?  I would do it all over again. I was asked, maybe some years later,    Come  on back in,    and today, I   m active, very active. I do not attend as many  meetings. That doesn   t interest me much anymore   co-chairman or  chairman of the county. Though I am a conservative and do support  them   I let the young people do it now. You make the decisions and I  do a lot of,    Come into my dining room table and talk.    I   ve talked to  many, many young men and women   not women, but young men   that  have run for office that have come to me first and we talk, and I tell  them what I know what are the things to do and kind of check them out.  They   re all very good. Some have won. Some very good ones have won.  Some have not, but money is the big thing nowadays and it   s very  important because the cost of living is more and the cost of running a  campaign is more, and many are paid workers now. I didn   t have that.  Some have other jobs now then? Is that what you   re saying by paid      paid workers?  Paid campaign advisors.  Okay.  18  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon     and in the evenings     What was your salary?  I had a salary. It wasn   t very much. I don   t remember.  Was there travel expenses?  Yes. Oh about, ten cents a mile or something   and you could speed and  the cops wouldn   t do anything to you.  Really? You were exempt because you were in the Legislature?  In the legislature. You were exempt.  But we didn   t speed, did we?  No, we didn   t. And I was taught how to drive by the local police chief  coming home late at night to keep myself safe. Oh, there are just so  many things that happened. I wish I could recall the many little things. I  was taken out on a gunnery range and taught how to use a gun because I  came home very late at night, after many functions. They were often in  the city and I would be alone in the car. I was taught how to use a gun  and had the permit to keep the gun in the car. And I had one episode that  was frightening   on the road from another driver, a single man in a  car   but I was taught what to do, how to react, and so forth and so on  so, just lots of things about that life that was exciting.  How did that come about though? Did you ask for instructions, or did  they just pop up and say,    You really need to know how to do this?     No, I knew everybody from the police chief to the garbage pick-up guy  whom I left doughnuts to, and I asked questions. I asked lots of  questions that I felt I needed to know, and the police chief or the  sheriff   oh, I called on the sheriff one time, who was my neighbor,  because I had someone following me     A stalker?  Stalker   I had a stalker, and so that came about through the sheriff   s  office, and they found him and took care of that. And then I had on the  telephone, someone that called me a lot, and the local telephone  company whom I knew, I knew everybody, see? Everybody knew  me   they just met me sooner or later, so I knew the telephone company  manager, and I called him about the telephone calls, and that was taken  care of. Oh, I can wander on and on as these things come back to my  19  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  mind   so many things.  But all of this within a couple of years    time?  I know.  Did they have someone to escort you out of the Capitol if it was late at  night or did you      Yes. Oh, we were well protected.  You had assigned parking spots?  Assigned     Even then?  South side of the Capitol, and some things were the same as the  opposition party. The seating in the House was not, and always  recognized from the floor. There was no problem there. It was just that  getting bills through, as we see nowadays in the U.S., the problems  that   on legislation, on voting, pretty much the same way in the state      pretty much the same way. The Speaker   oh, that   s another story. The  Speaker during my first election   the young man that I defeated wanted  to cut me out of a certain district. What   s the word I want? He wanted to  change the district   to gerrymander me.  Redistrict?  Redistrict   but there   s the other word I can   t think of right now   reapportionment  and so that there was no way I could win again  because I would be in a heavily democratic district.  Okay.  And the Speaker of the House, who turned out to be such a good friend,  and I can   t recall his name   I wish my memories had not faded, but he  stopped that very quickly. He said,    I will not have that. You will not        the word I want,       get her out of the district she   s in so that she can  never win again.    He said,    I will not allow this bill to go forth.    So     Good for him.  Yes, he stopped that. Had he not, it would have been even more difficult  for me. I had a lot of difficulties, but I just rolled with them at the time  and I   m sure many, many more memories that   I thought they were all  20  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  exciting and I really didn   t have any problem with depression. (Laughs)  Did you do your own research when you were presenting a bill or did  your secretary     No, the state legislative library does all of that for you. You tell her  the  library staff  what you want and she does it all. That   s a wonderful  system they have, and they still do that. The legislators do very little  work on a bill. It   s pretty much told to a library person that needs to  work on it and they do it all.  And then you just have to read everything they find?  That   s right, read it but they do everything. All you have to do is file it.  Do you remember about how long each bill would be page wise? I  mean, it   s probably some variance.  Some   not very thick in those days. They really were quite small, and  nowadays I can imagine they   re quite lengthy. The Equal Rights  Amendment, of course, was probably the longest one because of the  things that the presenters wanted for the women to be able to do, and  that was quite lengthy.  Did you do lunch in, lunch out?  Lunch in. Lots of dinners invited   could have saved a lot of money. So  many things happen every day. You either get a rose or invitations to  dinner, so many invitations. They want to see you and they want you to  say something and particularly here in Cleveland County.  There were so many crippled children east of town that I would visit  with   just so many things to do and I enjoyed going to all of them. I had  a very cooperative husband that took over with our children and helping  with homework.  Did you have to have a new wardrobe?  I did. I wore suits, and remember I lost those twenty pounds  campaigning. I was in a different dress size and I loved that. There were  no long dresses, never. I never saw a long dress in those days. Suits for  women and for the men always ties in the chambers. Now the Senate  would go in much later in the day. They would go in at 1:00pm, but the  House docket was 10:00 in the morning.  Until what time in the afternoon?  21  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Depending on the bills and the length, but would usually end about  4:00pm. They don   t work hard.  Well, I don   t know about that. (Laughter) You work hard preparing to  be there, I suppose.  I suppose.  No burning the midnight oil?  Not really.  No?  No. You receive so much help. You have so much legislative help  through the libraries and through the system, the government system     and, of course, I was lucky to be in office when there was a republican  governor, Henry Bellmon. I sat on the right of Ronald Reagan when he  was President. He came to Oklahoma, and of course he was republican  so our caucus met with him and we had breakfast, and I sat on his right,  and I have a picture   maybe it isn   t there   well, that   s strange, but   so  many celebrities   many political people     Who else?     that I was with. Well, Henry Bellmon, Dewey Bartlett   oh, the one  that died recently and they had the three-day funeral     Ford?  Ford, and met her  President Gerald Ford   s wife, Betty Ford . She was  inebriated. I could   ve told him, because I   ve read somewhere he never  realized that she had an alcoholic problem. I knew it the moment I saw  her.  Interesting.  I met her and all of the republicans. I didn   t meet Nixon. The interesting  thing is that I ran during Watergate years. It couldn   t have been a worse  time because there was so much scandal about that and here in Norman,  Oklahoma is this woman running for legislative post and she   s a  republican, and look how crooked they are in Washington   but it didn   t  touch me.  And you won.  22  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  Finchum  Hibdon  In the middle of the Watergate years, right in the worst part. The day  when Nixon was doing that, and he didn   t even touch me.  I would   ve loved to have known you back then. You would   ve been a  good role model.  Thank you.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  She loves people. She respects their opinion. She will always go part of  the way with you and she will discuss whatever part of government that  you feel very strongly about, and we   ll talk about it and if we don   t  agree, we still shake hands and like each other   because that   s life.  People just don   t agree with you sometimes, but I enjoyed the short time  that I was in state government and though I would have liked to have  made other changes, my timing was wrong.  Well, I   m thankful that you were there at least a little while.  Thank you.  And so thank you for joining us today.  Thank you.  ------- -------
