 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, May 7, 2012. I   m in Kingfisher County,  Oklahoma, on the A. Thomas Hill Farm interviewing Karmaleta Hempel  and Twila Williams. Thank you so much for joining us today. This  project is part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral History  Project. We   re going to begin today by learning how your family came  to Oklahoma. Would you like to start us off, Karmalita?  This story probably describes a lot of what happened in 1889, April  22nd. It was written by my great-aunt Maddie, who was the daughter of  John Derius Hill and Mary Shaw. She just tells her story and I   m going  to read it.    My father, John D. Hill, came to the opening of Oklahoma on  April 22, 1889. Brother Frank was sick at the time of the opening so  Mother could not come for the Run. Father first staked the farm east of  his farm, but a man came up from the creek and claimed he had staked  the farm first. So, Father went back west and traded a horse for the farm,  which he kept for a home. He filed on the farm and came back to Texas  and sold the little calves, which he said would be too small to make the  trip and a few other things. He then put all our earthly possessions in the  wagons and hitched two yoke of oxen to a wagon that was loaded high.  And then on behind this, hitched a trail wagon loaded with an extension  bed, which was wide so we would have room to ride and sleep at night.        Every night, one bed was made on the ground. We brought five cows  and they had to be milked. We would drink and use all the milk we  could and throw the rest away. We brought five horses and two of us  children rode to drive the cows. Three young horses were tied to the  back of the trail wagon. He had a very small garden, at first, then Father  dug a well in which mother hung her butter so it would be nice to sell.  He also made a dugout in which to keep the milk. The spring was nice,  but when it rained, we couldn   t get across the creek to get water. There  5  was a real large cottonwood tree near the house, which made a  wonderful shade for us.        My father and brother, Herbert, plowed and planted corn, Kaffir, and  cane as fast as they could, and planted crookneck squash, sibley, and  hybrid squash and pumpkins. We raised lots of them. When Father built  the sod house, we moved in and then gathered the pumpkins and squash.  The dugout was full of them and we sold some and fed some to the five  cows, which Mother milked. The grass was knee-high until it was  pastured so much.        Father freighted for the Fred Belt a few times the first summer and took  pay in groceries. The trips to Guthrie were long and hard. Father worked  some when they were building the railroad south of Kingfisher. Mother  washed and helped the woman who was cooking for the men who  worked on the railroad. The woman had three little girls and needed  help. With the money which the folks received, we had a wonderful  Christmas, which I never will forget. Father built a pole stable and  stacked lots of feed on the north side, and prairie chickens came to eat  the grain. When it snowed a lot, Father shot lots of them. We had them  to eat and took to town and sold some.        The next summer, Father built another sod house and when he thrashed,  he put his wheat in the first sod house and had a large bin of potatoes  and quite a bit of onions. He sold some in Kingfisher and took some to  El Reno. The sod houses were cool in summer and warm in winter. The  second summer, we raised nearly three barrels of cucumbers and we  pickled or brined. Mother thrashed them out and made sweet pickles of  them and sold them.        I never heard people talk about the hard times, then. I guess they didn   t  have time. Father hauled logs to the saw mill and the oak lumber was  used in the first house we built. Lou Thorpe helped build that house.  Father worked some at the stone quarry and got some stones for his  house and some for the walks to the well      the first house they owned,  the basement area was stone, I think      and some for the walks to the  well. Our first granary had a stone foundation, also.    That was basically  it.     When we were coming to Oklahoma, I started to get out of the wagon  one day about 1 p.m. to ride one of the ponies and help drive the cows.  As I jumped from the tongue, my dress caught and I fell and the front  wheel ran over my ankle. We drove the rest of that day and all the next  day until it was about 9 p.m. when we got to the doctor   s office at Fort  Reno. My ankle was awfully swollen, and the doctor and his two helpers  worked four hours with my ankle. When it was finished, I had the  6  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  thickest plaster of paris cast I ever saw, to wear for five weeks. The joint  was awful stiff so I soaked my foot every day in warm water and rubbed  it with angleworm oil, which we made by gathering lots of worms and  heating them carefully until they were an oil.        One of our ponies was bitten by a snake and as soon as Father found  her, he brought her to the well and tried to give her water. As it was hard  for her to bend her head down, Father put the tub in the wagon and the  horse stood there all the time with her jaw in the tub. Father emptied the  tub often and put fresh water in it. He also put some feed in the wagon,  and she could do as she wanted to do about eating. She lived several  years and was a very nice horse. There was a small sore on her jaw  where the snake had bitten her.        Our first school was in a sod house. Ms. Lula Hunt came down from  Kansas and taught one month. She stayed with her sister, Mrs. Dunlap.  Ms. Hunt was only sixteen and when the four weeks were up, she went  home. She and her mother came to visit us in 1891 when her brother, Ed,  cut our wheat. We had Sunday school at the sod schoolhouse and there  was some preaching. A colored minister preached one sermon. The  people liked his sermon very much, but I never saw him or his wife  again.        Mr. Preston was our first Sunday school superintendent and lived on  the farm that cornered Father   s on the northeast. He sold his farm and  moved near Cashion. He came to see us once and stayed all night. We  had a fine visit with him. He told us his days were numbered and he  expected to go any time so he wanted to get his business fixed for his  family. He went to Kingfisher just nineteen days after that, and he  reached to shake hands with one of his friends and that was the last  move he made and he was gone.    That   s the woman   s perspective of  being raised on this farm in 1889 and early 1900s.  And they made the Run from     I have another story that tells where they made the Run from. Let   s see.  Yes, this one tells that. It was written by my grandfather. Do you want to  hear that one, too?  Let   s hear it.  Okay.    My father      and this is written by my grandfather, Herbert C.  Hill. It was in the Kingfisher Free Press, 75th Anniversary Edition.    My  father, John D. Hill      this is a brother to Maddie,       was born in  Michigan, his parents having come from New York. My mother   s  parents, whose name was Shaw, had come from Canada to Michigan. I  7  Nykolaiszyn  was born in Michigan on November 17, 1879. Maddie, Lemuel, and  Robert were also born in Michigan. Father moved the family from  Michigan to Meade County, Kansas. Jenny and Frank were born during  the four years we lived in Kansas. Then we moved to Texas, where we  lived until April 1889.        At noon on April 22, 1889, Father started in the race for land from a  point just southwest of Kingfisher. He first staked the southeast quarter  on Uncle John   s Creek, four miles south of Kingfisher. After staking this  quarter, a sooner came up out of the creek and said he was there first.  The sooner gave Father a horse for that quarter. After that, Father staked  the adjacent southwest quarter, which he owned until his death. The  family came from Texas in covered wagons pulled by two yoke of oxen.  Lemuel and I rode horses and drove the cattle. The cows gave plenty of  milk for our food on the trip. The Indians wanted to trade for the little  blue-eyed boy, Lemuel.        The first summer we lived in a covered wagon under a large  cottonwood tree. A brush arbor was built for our living room, and a cave  was dug in the bank in which the butter and cheese were stored. In the  fall, we built a sod house, which was warm for the winter and cool  during the next summer. The next year, the sod house was enlarged and  used for the following four years. Additional children born during this  time were Etta, Alva, Jim, and Floyd. The first year, we plowed with  oxen and planted feed and garden. Some feed and butter were sold. In  Kingfisher, we sold squash and potatoes. We had antelope, deer, quail,  prairie chickens, cottontail rabbits, and jackrabbits for food. On the  creeks, there were raccoon, mink, beaver, and opossum. Several  rattlesnakes were killed in the first few years.        Later, we hauled lumber from Uncle John   s Creek and from Campbell  Creek to build the first frame house on the farm. There were four rooms  downstairs and one room upstairs. A good well was dug near the house.  This well was used to supply water for horses and thrasher crews.    Also,  this house was built in 1892 and the well was dug in 1892. Then they  later built a barn in 1910, which is still here on the farm.    First      this is  my grandfather      First, I attended a school in Kansas and later, one in  Texas. After moving to Kingfisher County, I went to school with my  younger brothers and sisters in a sod house. I attended Kingfisher  College. Several of the children went to Kingfisher High School, some  to Edmond Teacher   s College, and others to Hill   s Business College.     The next part tells about him going out west to Ellis County to do  another land run and stake a claim.  Just so I have the generations correct, your father and mother were   ?  8  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  A. Thomas Hill and Thelma Hill.  And then your grandparents?  Herbert C. Hill and Lily Day Hill.  And your great-grandparents?  John Derius Hill and Mary Shaw Hill.  And they made the Run and     Yes, yes.  Okay, good. So, when they moved here, you know you have to live on the  land for so long, did they build a dugout?  They did. They called it a sod house in here, but I know at first, it was  just a dugout.  It does talk about a dugout. It said there was a brush arbor and then they  had a dugout for the milk and vegetables. And then it said they, before  winter came, they enlarged the dugout so the family could live in there.  What would happen over time to the dugout?  Like if you looked for it now?  Yes.  It would be eroded. I tried to find that spot. The only way I can find that  spot now   because I came back after having not looked for thirty years.  The creek has changed   the little stream has changed its course. The  cottonwood tree, there is no sign of it, that they parked the wagon under.  That was wonderful shade they talk about in the stories.  We know the general area. We can show you.  We can tell by a post because there was a fence. The corner post was  where my dad showed me that they had the dugout and camped. I  remember the cottonwood tree had been struck by lightning when I was  a child. I can   t find all that stuff now, I can just find the corner post.  But we can show you that.  So, tell me about some of the early structures on the property.  9  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Well, as I told you in those stories, it was a sod house. The dugout,  before that, to put the cold things in to keep cold. Then they dug another  well down closer to the area they first settled in. Then in 1892, they dug  the well, that we knew as the windmill, which you can still see here.  That   s where they also built a home, which was described in that story.  The family lived in that. When we came here, when we were children  here, you could still see some of the furnishings they had. Like a horse  hair sofa that was back on a back wall and a creamer and different things  they had used were in that house, still.  How big was the home?  Four rooms downstairs and one up. Not large.  Maybe a basement or a little bit of a basement?  I think there was a little bit of a basement.  The well was dug real close within ten steps of this house. They lived in  that house until 1914 or    15 when they built the home that was here that  burned in    04.  Well, tell me about that home.  Okay. That home was a 1914 Montgomery Ward     Pre-fab type.     mail order house. The lumber and nails were shipped by rail. It was  two-story, it was a square. Every room was square, I think. They were  kind of on top of each other. Four rooms upstairs for bedrooms with a  little hall at the top of the stairs and a closet. Four rooms downstairs,  living room, dining room separated by double doors of dark mahogany-type  wood.  And an enclosed stairway that emptied into the kitchen.  Kitchen and bedroom on the south side of the house, and as you came  around from the kitchen to the bedroom, there was an enclosed stairwell  up to the upstairs. It had a door at the bottom. That   s where we had our  old-timey telephone. They didn   t have that at first.  I couldn   t bring that, that   s on my wall. (Laughter)  She actually has that decorating her house. Then on the back porch, it  10  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  was   I don   t know, I think it was enclosed even early on. But definitely  when we were there. We had a washtub and the old fashioned wringer  thing going with a rinse tub, on that porch. Then later, a freezer on the  other end. It was fairly roomy. On the south end of that was, when my  grandmother lived here and my great-grandmother, a pantry and maybe  a washroom or something. We made a bathroom on that south end with  a sink, toilet, and bathtub in it. They didn   t have that until we moved  here in 1950. The kitchen was large, had sunny, south windows and kind  of the hub of the home, I think, always.  When we moved here in 1950, they were using woodstoves. Wood for  heat and wood for cooking. We actually had a pile of coal out there that  sometimes they used when I was really young. It wasn   t much. But he  bought it from the estate. His father lived here at the time with his  family. They had moved back here in 1934 because Grandpa John  Derius Hill was alone. His wife had passed away. He was needing help.  He was getting elderly and senile and needed help, and they came to  come take care of him.  At that time, the two oldest children of Herbert C. Hill, my father, A.  Thomas Hill, and his brother, Earnest, were in college at OSU  (Oklahoma A M at that time). Ruby, their sister, had married and  stayed out in western Oklahoma. The other children were raised here,  my dad   s brothers and sisters. There were seven that were raised here  and went to school here. They went to a little school. I think my uncle  called it Victory School. I   ve got notes on that somewhere. I may have  left them at home. Victory School was less than a mile east of here. Two  of the boys, I know, were in 4-H Club, maybe three.  The youngest  girl  was even in 4-H Club. My uncle told me that recently. I have two uncles  still living that can tell me a little bit of history of this farm. When they  moved here in 1934,  during the  Depression years they used the  woodstove for heat and woodstove for cooking.  The other children didn   t want to come back to the farm?  Well, they were already grown, at OSU (Oklahoma A M at that time).  They came back to visit, I   m sure, but they were grown.  They didn   t want to work the land, or   ?  Well, my dad really had a dream since he was a little boy, since his  grandfather lived here. He came back when he was three or four and has  an early memory of coming back on a train to this place and was so  excited to see it and see his family.  He loved the land. Our daddy loved the land.  11  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  He always loved the land. And he dreamed from the time   he made two  or three more trips back, he wanted to live here and farm this land.  So, he was waiting for an opportunity.  He worked his way through the Depression on ranches out in western  Oklahoma in Roger Mills County and put himself through high school  and then worked his way through college at OSU (Oklahoma A M at  that time). I   ve got stories about that. It may not apply to this history, but  he really had to work his way in the barns and the different areas there to  get to be a student there and graduated there. I think he went there,  maybe, around 1932. I   ve got when he graduated, somewhere. But he  got his first degree in vocational agriculture and then taught vocational  agriculture, but he also got a master   s degree in  economics .  Agronomy?  Well, anyway, he ended up working in that field, but he studied  agronomy.  At the time our daddy was in college at Oklahoma A M, his family was  really struggling here on the farm to feed the family, to clothe them. And  one of the girls said   they tell a story about one of the girls, she said,     Momma is going to have another baby and we don   t have enough shoes  for the ones we have.    So, there was definitely very much of a struggle.  Even A. Thomas Hill and Ernest, his brother, in school at OSU would  send money home for like glasses for their mother or something like  that, as little as they had.  They tried to help out.  The children being raised here,  from  the youngest one  age  five up to  about high school age, when they moved here. As soon as they got high  school age, they worked off the farm to support themselves.  They didn   t have school buses to transport the children to high school.     to Kingfisher High School so they stayed in town with an uncle and  lived in his basement or worked for someone and stayed in town to go to  high school. They worked for their older sister who had gotten married  and lived on a farm east of here. The boys would go work and help over  there, and the girls would go help with those children.  So our daddy, A. Thomas, is the one who started college. He was the  12  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  oldest of ten children and several of the other brothers and sisters  followed, to get their college degrees   against all odds.  He encouraged them a whole lot and tried to help them.  But Herbert C., their daddy, he valued an education. When some of the  men were probably keeping their children home for harvest, I think he  sent his to school. I think that   s why they were able to complete high  school and go to college.  Well, tell me about the early crops being grown.  I asked my Uncle John that question because he grew up here and had  heard that. Let   s see if I can find that.  And he was a vo-ag teacher and     He ended up being a vo-ag teacher. A lot of them majored in vocational  agriculture or something related to that. I know they raised oats and  wheat.  This early, early story relates too, that they did sugarcane.  Or some kind of cane.  It   s some kind of cane.  I don   t know if it was sugarcane. I had that somewhere in that story, too.  But they did, my Uncle John told me, have more acres in wheat and in  crops. They got to where they had about a hundred   let   s see if I can  find that note. They ended up having a lot in crops and then when my  dad bought the farm, he gradually put native grass back in some areas  and had some more pasture. It probably had to do with, he was a product  of the Depression, Dust Bowl days and was studying conservation at   Oklahoma A M .  So, this farm has a lot of natural grasses on it that were planted by my  dad.  And the man renting it now would like to plow up some of that, and I   m  real hesitant to put more in wheat because I know Dad had a reason for  having those pastures there. Sometimes you can make your living from  cattle when you can   t when the wheat gets hailed out or drought takes it  or something. I had the crops written down here. I can   t find my notes  on that. I know they raised alfalfa when we were children and the  generation before them raised alfalfa. I don   t know when that started.  13  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Somewhere I   ve got how many acres were in crops at one point.  But this particular land seems to have been best suited for wheat. That   s  what you   ll see in this area more than anything else.  My mother was raised in eastern Oklahoma. When she came here, she  was amazed that you could just plant your seed and leave it in the  ground, and you didn   t have to hoe in between or pull anything. It just  kind of took care of itself until it was time to harvest. Of course, there  are still a lot of things that can happen to the crops before they get  harvested.  Where would you take the crops to market?  Well, when we were children,  they  had  grain  elevators in town that  you took them to.  Kingfisher?  Kingfisher Co-Op elevator.  Kingfisher Co-Op elevator and then they were freighted to wherever  they went  for  the next step in the process. And I don   t know about  when my grandfather was here. I   m sure it was a railroad car that carried  the grain. I know there were threshing crews and threshers before there  were combines. I   ve read something in here about the well they dug, the  one we were raised with, too. They went to a certain depth so the water  would be a softness or something for the threshing of the wheat. Which,  I don   t understand about that.  Your father   s mother, did she have a job off the farm?  She didn   t at first. She quit working. She was a teacher before we were  born.  No, she   s talking about   oh, our father   s mother.  A. Thomas Hill   s wife, Thelma Hill?  You were talking about the grandmother, weren   t you?  Right, your father   s mother.  Our grandmother. No, she was home.  Oh, no, she had ten children.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Okay, so she was full-time     Oh, full-time, very. (Laughter)  And mostly taking care of the kids in the house. She did carry, I   m sure,  water from a well, too, sometimes.  And then your grandmother was a teacher?  My mother was a teacher. She didn   t teach after we were born until I  was in the fourth grade. There was a drought  in the early 1950s . Every  crop my dad planted, the cotton crop, they even tried cotton, and it  failed. The wheat crops were not very good.  That was the last year to try cotton. (Laughter)  Yes, it wasn   t fun and didn   t work. It was hard to make a living, those  years. When I was in fourth grade, I guess they figured I was old enough  I could come home with a key and get in the house. She started teaching.  My dad was still here, but he would be out working on the farm. We   d  come home from school and Mother would get home a couple hours  later because she taught in Cashion at first. Then when I was in the sixth  grade, twelve, eleven, probably eleven, my dad went to work for Soil  Conservation Service. He had to travel all the time. The home office, I  think, was Claremore, but he worked in eastern Oklahoma County,  McAlester, Chickasha     Oklahoma City, El Reno        Claremore. He worked in all those places, and he worked until he  retired. He was probably sixty-five when he retired.  So he was a part-time farmer.  He was a part-time farmer and it was very stressful. He would call home  and ask what the weather was. Mother was always supposed to know.  She was supposed to turn on the TV and watch the weather forecast.  His vacations were harvest.  He took his vacation to harvest.  We never traveled and took vacations as such.  On weekends, he would race home and get out there and do the work  15  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  that had to be done. He   d be tired at night and have to drive back to  Claremore or McAlester or wherever he was working.  Would he have outside help?  He did hire help, but not usually when he was gone. It was when he was  home, he would hire someone.  He would go to town to the courthouse where people would gather that  were looking for employment. He also picked up hitchhikers along the  road, highway, and they came and worked for him. Sometimes high  school boys came out and worked. My mother fixed the noon meal for  them, and that was dinner. They got the full meal deal. If they were too  busy to come in, their meal would be taken to them in a bucket to the  field. So, he got the help wherever he could find it. It was temporary  help, it wasn   t full-time help. In fact, one of the hired men was sleeping  out under the trees on a cot and the wind came up, such a gust of wind  that it blew his cot over. That could have been Alabama Joe. He was the  one from Alabama that we always remembered.  He actually got to sleep in a bed in the house after that, I think.  (Laughter)  Dad  would also come through El Reno on his way home  from Chickasha. He would stop and pick up hitchhikers near that prison  and my mother would say,    Don   t pick up those hitchhikers.    He  brought some out here to work on the farm. It   s a wonder we   re still here  today. (Laughs)  We were never        worried about that. Even though we took milk and sandwiches to the  field and interacted with them, never any problems with them. They  enjoyed talking to us and joking with us. But there were always hired  men when my dad was working on the farm. Except for maybe in the  winter when we could kind of handle it ourselves. Then we got old  enough to where we handled quite a bit, too, in the way of chores.  (Laughter)  Well, we   re going to get to that in a little bit. So, it was a dream of your  father   s to come back to this farm. When he did, did he switch up the  crops at that time?  Like I said, he put in more pasture over the years. I   ve got it written  down somewhere how many acres there were toward the end in wheat,  and how many there were at one time earlier on.  Our daddy just had a passion for the land and the soil and the crops. He  16  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  took the pride of ownership in being part of the legend that preceded him  here. That was very important to him from all his life until he died. He  was out here when he was ninety-five. He still lived here and was doing  everything he could.  Well, being a conservationist, did he terrace the land?  He did, and he was so conservative with his money, and you had to be  from the Depression years. It was a hard time making a living. He never  bought the newer, bigger tractors. He had a little gray Ford Ferguson  tractor, and he plowed those terraces up and back with that. We rebuilt  those terraces, he built in 1950, just this past 2011, with bulldozers.  That   s what he got the award for, that conservation     Soil conservation award that he got in 1990-something     For building the terraces and for planting the grasses.  Native grasses, and doing some crop   they call it CRP, now, but they  called it Soil Bank at one time, I think. He did a lot of terracing, but he  did it just with that little Ford tractor going back   I remember just  seeing him going back and forth. That took a lot of time to do that way.  His budgeting teacher was the Depression, but also growing up in a poor  family and also, he learned a lot about economy when he was at  Oklahoma A M. Our mother, also, knew a lot about budgeting because  she grew up in the Depression and also, she was schooled at Oklahoma  A M in home economics. In the 1930s, she worked for Farm Security, a  government loaning agency for farmers. Her job had been to teach the  farmer   s wife how to make what were called    home plans,    to  accompany the farm plans made by the farm supervisor. So, her home  plan here on this farm had a slim budget. But somehow, back then, we  didn   t have so many requirements as we have now. So, we were well-fed  and we were clothed. We didn   t want for anything, really. It was  stressful for our parents. That was the biggest challenge of living on the  farm was just trying to make the dollar stretch. I do remember one  Christmas, where our mother   and we always got one gift   she said,     This year, there was only one dollar for your Christmas gift.    So, we  went to the catalog, Montgomery Ward catalog, and I picked out a  storybook doll, and I was satisfied with that. I don   t know what you got.  I think I got a storybook doll, too. One year, I got a hairbrush.  (Laughter) One year, I got a scarf. I wrote that in my diary.  But we can remember those things. If we had gotten fifty things, could  17  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  we remember that now?  No.  Not really.  What is a   ?  Storybook doll?  No, a   well, that, but what is a home plan? What she did    It was a  budget?  Actually, I should have brought it. I   ve got some of them. It was a home  farm record book. You got those from probably your county agent.  But this was the home plan she did back in the    30s. So, if you were the  farmer   s wife and she came in here, the man would go out with a farmer  and make the budget or be at the table and make the budget. You were  the farmer   s wife, she would come in and sit down with you and say,     What are your necessities? What is your source of income? This is how  you can save money, and this is what part of your budget should be for  this and that.     Interesting. And then, a storybook doll? What   s that?  I think it was a rigid, probably about six inches tall.  They fit inside a storybook-looking thing. It opened like a book. It was  just in there and they were just little cute dolls. I don   t know if there was  a story with them, but they were dressed and they were small.  It was something we got for Christmas that we remembered. (Laughs)  Most of the people that were our age got a storybook doll for Christmas  at one time or another.  And a few other things, maybe. All depending on farming for income.  (Laughter)  So when you moved here in the    50s, tell me, outside of the home, what  were some of the structures still left on the land?  They were all here, except that I don   t remember seeing the dugout. But  the barn, the old 1892 house, the windmill. They built some henhouses  for laying hens on the west end of that home they built in 1892. They  18  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  just extended it out and put a henhouse, kind of went out west from that.  A little garage was up there, too. I remember my dad could pull his truck  in it.  Then there was the original frame house that, by the time we moved  here, had been rocked. There was a garage closer to the house, but it was  detached.  It was a buggy garage.  It was called a buggy garage.  But we used it for our cars, too.  Very narrow and very crude.  It was right outside this house, just right within ten steps of this house.  There was kind of a little shed that the sheep went in sometimes. So,  there were several little buildings and an old barnyard.  Behind the buggy garage was another henhouse that I remember when I  was little, going out to gather eggs. You ate the fryers and saved the  laying hens for laying eggs. That was just out behind that little buggy  garage.  Well our mother would go out and chase down a hen. She would wring  its neck. She would step on its neck. She would pull its head off. She  would dip it in boiling water, and then we would sit outside and pluck  the feathers. Then we got fresh chicken for supper. It was very good.  (Laughter)  See, I always ask,    Was there always a technique?    Everybody has a  different technique with the chicken.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Well, where did you move from?  We moved, let   s see, my parents first lived in Covington, Oklahoma and  he taught vo-ag there for five or six years. I saw that, it was quite longer  than I thought. Then they moved from there to Dover, which is between  Kingfisher and Enid. I was born there and lived there until I was two.  She wasn   t born yet. Then we moved to Moore. He taught vo-ag at  19  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Dover and then at Moore High School. We just lived within a block of  the high school.  I was born then.  We were right next to the railroad track. She was born there, and we  lived there until I was about four and you were two. Then we moved to  El Reno for a few short months, and he taught veterans there. This was  right after the war.  After World War II.  After World War II, he taught veterans there. Then we moved at the end  of 1949 or very first of January of 1950, I think right at the tail end of  1949, into this house. Not this house, but the one that John Derius Hill  built in 1914.  I had just turned two.  We moved into that house.  Which they modernized with a bathroom before we moved in.  I know you were young, but did you have a sense of what was going on?  Was it a shock to you that,    Now, I have all this land to run around on.     I don   t remember that.  I was two so this was my life, my home. I roamed all over this land. I  loved to go outside and go down the road and pick the wildflowers and  ride my bicycle down the road and wander all over the land and go down  to the trees, what we called the woodland and play around down there. It  was real peaceful down there. In the springtime, there were the sweet  blossoming-type of trees. I was more the one that loved being outside.  Karm would sit in the house and read a book.  That   s her memories. I loved outside, too. (Laughs)  Well, you worked. You did a lot of work. I was the little sister so she  was the one that did more work.  We were playing in the woodland and things like that, but we could  roam this farm. They never worried about us being out of sight, which is  different than today. But I remember that it was a two-story house and it  had an upstairs. It was big compared to where we lived before. I didn   t  want to sleep upstairs.  There  was only one bedroom downstairs, but we  20  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  were both afraid to go upstairs and sleep. I was afraid to get away from  my parents so I would lay on the floor in the kitchen with one of those  bulbs, that glaring, just bulb hanging down in the kitchen. There wasn   t  a globe around it. Lay on the floor and go to sleep on the floor and then I  guess they carried me to bed. We all slept in one big bedroom that first  couple of years and I finally moved upstairs. We didn   t like being  upstairs by ourselves.  I don   t remember being afraid of being upstairs at all.  Because I was there. (Laughter)  I remember laying upstairs and the cross breeze blowing across  the   and the sounds outside, the sounds of nature. I remember hearing  Daddy going around the field in the tractor. I remember the Johnny Pop  tractor, the neighbor that had the Johnny Pop tractor. You could hear it  pop, pop, popping around. So, I have sweet memories of sleeping  upstairs.  Oh, I do, too. I loved the moon. You could see it in the east. The window  was right by the bed so you could see.  We didn   t have any real close neighbors. The closest neighbor was a  quarter-mile away. They didn   t have any children so we pretty much  grew up with each other except when our cousins came out. Sometimes  we had some church friends home on Sunday afternoon, but it was pretty  much she and I. We had a pretty big playground here.  And you were the only children of Thomas Hill.  Yes. That   s why I sound just like her because she   s the only person I had  to talk to. (Laughs)  But because my father had nine brothers and sisters, they all came back  to visit sometime during the year. Their memories of their childhood,   was  an important part of it, coming to the farm. I didn   t realize they  thought we were rich because we had that big house, but we were poor.  We had hand-me-down clothes, you know. They loved coming out here,  and we enjoyed having them. They got to sleep upstairs.  Oh, we loved when the cousins came, that was fun.  Do you know what year the farm got electricity?  I did write that down. I think it was on the last page here. Nineteen  twenty-eight, maybe? Let   s see if I got that down.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  And indoor water.  It came with the 1950 moving in. I remember the man that helped them  build that bathroom.  But we continued to carry water from the well to drink. Otherwise, we  had faucets for all other water uses. But that well water was really tasty.  Kept it in a bucket and dipped it out with a dipper.  How far would you have to walk with the water?  From here to the barn, close to the barn. Just this side of the barn, not  that far. But I remember carrying the buckets, and you do, too, don   t  you?  Oh, I carried those buckets.  We could carry two buckets. (Laughter) Not now.  Then we had to go down after dark and turn the windmill off sometimes.  It was quite a ways from the house for a little child. I would think there  was a giant coming from that corner up there to get me.  Oh, you had lots of fears. (Laughter) They thought I was real brave and  never scared. I was scared sometimes.  Tell me about your chores growing up.  Well, a lot of our chores had to do with the sheep because the cattle  didn   t have as much maintenance as the sheep.  We were in charge of the sheep as soon as we got old enough. My dad  may have let them out in the morning of the pen, but if they weren   t in  the pen at night, the coyotes got them. It was our job to bring them in so  we got behind them and drove them in the pen, and I had to count them.  She did later, probably. Well, I don   t know.  I did the trying-to-mess-you- up on the counting. (Laughs)  I would be counting and there were a lot of sheep and they move around.  They don   t just line up and let you count them.  She would stand over there and mess my counting up. I don   t remember  that, but anyway, I was responsible for getting those sheep in. I do  22  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  remember early on that one got left out and I saw what the coyote did to  it. That impressed me.  There were times that we took the sheep down to greener pastures, little  shepherdesses.  During the hot dry summers, we took them all the way down to the  woodland and all the way as far as they wanted to go, except we  couldn   t let them go out of the fence where the creek kind of left an  opening and the fence couldn   t quite keep them in. We had to make sure  they     They had to be protected. They couldn   t just be out there on their own.  They had to be dipped, they had to be sheared, I guess, wormed     Tagged     They had to have ear tags. They were registered Shropshire sheep that  our daddy        sold to FFA boys.  They showed the sheep in the fairs.  And you   d have to shear them and tag them?  We didn   t shear them. We hired a crew to come in and shear them.  Well, now, our daddy had shears.  He didn   t do most of that. He had sheared one, but that whole bunch of  sheep, that was a big job.  He did have more than one pair of electric shears. I didn   t do that part, I  know.  I watched this crew shear them. Like you said, you had to dip them  sometimes. I don   t know. We always had to dip them.  They were kind of high maintenance, sheep were. But Daddy was real  proud of his sheep and he did have some award winning sheep in the  fairs.  Prize winning sheep that went all the way to Kansas City. That picture  burned up, but I remember that picture being in our other house. The  sheep chores were the main thing. In the wintertime, I had to go throw  23  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  hay. I don   t know if you had to.  I remember pitching hay out of the barn after school.  On the hay mound down into where the cattle would eat.  How many head would you have back then?  I don   t remember. Maybe fifty?  We had more sheep than we had cattle, I know.  Probably at the most, maybe, fifty head of cattle.  No milk cows?  Yes, we did have milk cows. They were milked until Mother started  teaching.  And would you have to milk it?  I did do it, but I never got good at it. (Laughter)  I never got good at it, and  they were  Jersey cows. My daddy used to  squirt the milk in my mouth if I happened to be in the barn at the right  time. (Laughter) I remember that. There was no milking machine, it was  all hand-milking and old stalls that they anchored the cow   s head in. I  could never get any out, either. That   s a technique. (Laughs)  I got a little bit out, but I gave that back over to Mother. She could do it  faster.  I guess if we got hungry enough, we would have figured it out.  Dad milked, too.  Did you have a large garden?  We didn   t have a large garden. When my grandmother was here and my  great-grandmother was here, this front yard was all garden and they  raised a lot because they were self-sustaining. Dad would till up some of  the land for potatoes and maybe some watermelon.  A little squash.  A little squash, but we didn   t grow much garden. We went into town to  24  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams   Springer   s  Market. We would buy our produce there.  So you didn   t do a lot of canning?  No, actually, our grandmothers did. My dad got a big freezer and put it  on that back porch. So, we would buy fruit  in season  pretty reasonably  and slice the peaches or whatever it was and freeze them. That was one  of my favorite things, sliced peaches with cream.  For some reason, gardening was not Daddy   s thing. Our mother being  employed off the farm, it was not hers either. Although, she knew how  to can, that wasn   t what she did.  Well, freezing was a lot easier than canning. (Laughs)  Now, we did churn the milk and make butter, but that wasn   t our only     And I remember her making cottage cheese and hanging it in a cheese  cloth out on the clothesline.  I remember that, too.  And our chores were hanging clothes.  Pulling weeds  That was my least favorite  (Laughter)  Did you ever drive the tractor?  I did. By the time I was twelve,  Dad  was teaching me. You did later.  I did a little.  Do you remember the first time you drove?  I remember, he would outline how the tractor should follow. You just  got in the next line, plowed the next line, just got your wheels lined up  with what was supposed to be next. I would go around and round. He  would pay me and I saved it. I don   t remember how much I got paid, but  I saved it. Some of it went toward college. Probably got to keep some  for buying a purse or something.  You bought a watch and then you jumped in the pool with it. (Laughter)  But our daddy used to go back to OSU and visit the agriculture  department there and talk to people there. I remember seeing the  beautiful farms there, with all the perfect rows of beautiful green crops.  Do you remember that? And then our mother retained her dentist there,  25  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  from her college years so she would take us back ever year.  At least twice a year, yes.  And visit her dentist there. Take us to the university and see those  beautiful old buildings and the gorgeous landscaping that was there. I  thought,    Oh, I want to go to school there, someday.    That was my  dream, was it yours?  No. It was probably one of my choices, but not where I ended up.  Anyway, I just thought it was a beautiful campus.  Speaking of school, where did you go to school when you were growing  up?  Kingfisher High School.  Rode the school bus.  Kingfisher Elementary School, Kingfisher Junior High, and Kingfisher  High School.  How   d you get to school?  School bus.  Our buses were not the long buses like we see mostly now. They were  the shorter buses. Sometimes, if the roads were muddy, the bigger boys  would get in the back and go back and forth and try to get the bus stuck.  Do you remember that? (Laughs) So, we had a lot of time riding the  school bus and got to know a lot of students in the school by being on  the school bus.  With high school, junior high, and elementary school.  All in one bus.  It   s still that way.  And were your parents very encouraging? Did they say,    Think about  college.   ? Did you have a choice?  Oh, from birth. They started saving for our college as far back as we can  remember.  26  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  And you don   t get married before you finish college. So, I never had a  thought that I wouldn   t go to college.  No, I think we just knew we would go to college, and we knew how hard  they saved for us to go. We actually, even though they had a hard time  on the farm when they went to work off the farm, they were able to save  for our education so we didn   t have to work.  They were very careful with their money and they invested carefully. So,  we really, each of us were able to go to college without working.  Of course, we didn   t have a car. That wasn   t a necessity then.  Yes. But they paid our room and board, books, clothes     We didn   t have a lot of spending money, you didn   t need much.  I think I got a candy bar a day.  I didn   t.  And I can remember there was a place in Stillwater that had fifteen cent  grilled cheese sandwiches back in the late    60s. (Laughs)  Did you both go to Stillwater?  I didn   t go to Stillwater. I went to Chickasha Women   s College, first,  because my daddy was working in Chickasha for Soil Conservation  Service. One summer I went there. Then I went to Oklahoma Christian  College, which is now Oklahoma Christian University, for a year in    63-     64. Then I went to what used to be called Central State College. Now,  it   s University of Central Oklahoma and graduated from there in 1966.  Then our parents, as soon as we had children and they had  grandchildren, they started saving for our children   s college education.  Well, they started contributing like a hundred dollars at Christmas  toward that. They didn   t get presents. They got one hundred dollars in  the bank for college. (Laughter)  But they highly valued education.  And during your breaks from college, would you come back to the farm  and work?  Not if I could help it.  27  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Yes, we didn   t come back much. (Laughter) But I went  to college   every summer. I started the summer after high school. I just went every  summer to school. I know one year after I got married and wasn   t quite  out of college, I came back. My husband and I worked a little bit on the  farm.  My husband at the time, and sons, we came back a few times to help  with harvest, which were very memorable times.  Did you have any desires to go into farming?  Not me. (Laughter)  I would love to have lived out here if it looked like it did back then. But  after you put up this business down the road that has a lot of junky-looking  machinery parts, downwind of the dairy that        brings flies.     brings odors. (Laughs) I   m looking at Amber because she lives here  now. (Laughter) She moved in and the wind was not out of the dairy  direction. She just was fine and then we got a call later that night  when  the wind changed directions ,    Help     (Laughter)  Well, they asked him.  There also is some runoff in the little creek that snakes through our  property. Sometimes it has pollution from runoff from the dairy. So,  those things are disappointing. Those things have changed the landscape  out here. So, I would have liked to have lived out here at one time. I  wouldn   t want to depend on farming for my income. I wasn   t up for that.  My oldest granddaughter would like to move out here. She   s real  country-minded and likes to hunt and fish and ride the tractor and mow  and all that. She   d like to live out here some day.  I   m guessing he started with 160 acres?  Yes.  Did he ever expand around them?  He bought the farm south a quarter-mile south, across this east-west road  in about 1985, I think.  28  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  And he sold two little acreages within this farm to a couple of different  people.  Six acres to a man on that far corner that way and twelve acres to a man  at the far corner, this way. (Gestures)  Nobody lives in one of them and somebody lives in the other one, now.  Any major changes during your father   s time, to the farm?  No, remember, he was very frugal and so was our mother. (Laughs)  So, the home wasn   t remodeled much or furnishings changed much. The  buildings got more and more stuff in them because he didn   t believe in  spending money, even for his tractor. The last time I remember him  driving a tractor, he had tied a chair up on the post where the seat used to  be. He was ninety-five   or older than that? Yes, about ninety-four, I  think, trying to get up and ride that tractor.  Our daddy invested wisely, but he didn   t spend his money. He got his  clothes from the     Thrift shop.     the resale shop in Kingfisher. So, even though he was really generous  with us, he was very frugal with himself and still really had the  Depression mentality as far as     Holding onto everything.  holding onto   and our mother was very frugal, also. She would save the  rubber bands off the newspapers.  Aluminum foil.  And iron the wrapping paper after you use it, you iron it. I guess you   d  have to iron the sacks, the gift sacks, now. (Laughter) She was very,  very frugal and very good at making the dollar stretch. We never went  out to eat, almost virtually never. Maybe once a year or such.  No, not when we were little.  Well, not in the early years at all. We didn   t know what that was.  Would you go to town at all?  29  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  We went to town, the grocery store.  We went to church every Sunday.  Did you ever go to the picture show?  Not often. Dad didn   t like that. But we did some when we were in high  school and a few times in grade school.  I remember the first picture show I saw.  Yes, I do, too. A cousin took us.  The Ten Commandments, or something?  No, I remember one. I don   t remember the name of it.  But our dad was really not into recreation. (Laughter) Of course, we  made a lot of friends in school.  He thought work was fun, working on the farm was fun. That was his  vacation and he wanted it to be ours.  That   s what he called his vacation. We had a little different opinion  about that. (Laughter)  How would he keep records?  My mother kept the records. But I remember even up until almost he  died that whenever he went to the bank and deposited any money, he  would call her and tell her what he put in the bank and tell her what he  bought, and she just kept records of all of that.  Her records were very meticulous.  She might write it on a note first, but then it went to a farm record book.  They were serious about count ing  all their expenses  against the farm  income .  She would be keeping it today if she was able. Memory-wise, she   s not  able to do that right now.  But I followed her example. And one thing they did for us that really  helped me is from the time they were about my age or younger, maybe  sixty, they started showing me their file cabinet, and he saved  everything. The file cabinet with all the records for every year that went  30  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  back, back, back. He took me to town and introduced me to the banker,  the telephone office people. Everywhere there was that he did any  business, he would introduce me to people. So, when he died, I knew  these people. I knew where his bank accounts were. I knew how to take  care of the telephone bill and how to take care of this or that that had to  do with this farm. I was able to keep the record book because my mother  had gone over that with me. I could just start up where she left off.  He was living on his own when he was ninety-five and passed away. He  would go to town and get his  newspaper . We didn   t really want him to  drive. We tried to put an end to that, but it didn   t happen. But he would  go to town and buy his newspaper and pay his bills because he liked to  socialize with the people in town. Sometimes they came out and helped  him out of his car.  He went to all the meetings, the Wheat Growers Association, Pioneer  Telephone meetings. Just every one of them, he went to anything he was  associated with, he went to the meetings.  Were there any natural disasters?  In 1942  or 1943  the house was hit by a tornado. My uncles and aunts  were there. It was in the middle of the night, there was no warning. It  blew out all the windows but one north window. It blew the double  doors that were between the dining room and living room down, but it  didn   t hurt anyone. It may have done a little damage to outside  buildings, I don   t know.  Then in 2004, the house burned down. There was a big grassfire. We  think it might have started  from  real high winds, like seventy and  eighty-mile gusts, and it may have clapped some old electrical lines  together because there wasn   t anyone smoking on the property. There  might have been a storm eighteen miles away with a little lightning. But  anyway, a big grassfire started and it finally caught the propane tank on  fire, then the house was a goner. It was too hard to put out. So, it burned  to the ground along with the buggy garage and henhouse. Then that  night, after they thought they had it all out and the  fire department  left,  embers from it burned the old house built in 1892 and the brooding  house. The only thing it didn   t burn was the barn, which had a metal  roof and this Case Ban building out here. It didn   t burn those two. The  Case Ban building was built later, like in the    70s or    80s.  The fire was a big tragedy for your family. What happened? Tell me  about the cleanup afterwards.  That   s an interesting story because our daddy really could not bear to  31  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  bury the rubble, so it stayed there with orange whatever they call it for  safety.  We  fenced off that area. He could not bear     To fill in the basement hole where everything landed.  Just sunk into the basement. So, it wasn   t until he was     After he passed away.     yes, that we could actually clean up, bury the rubble.  Four years later.  Heartbreaking for him. Even though it was an old house with old  furniture and nothing that the world would value in there, it was his  home and he was really devastated. He really didn   t know what to do.   We  finally got him interested, twisted his arm and talked  him  into  getting this home     This home is a double-wide Solitaire home. He was going to just go  spend five thousand dollars for an old rickety trailer that the floor was  caving in because he didn   t want to spend money. We took him to the  city and it   s the first time I ever remember him writing a big check, and  making a decision in one day, to buy this house. He wanted to live here  on this farm so bad. He was at the point of wanting to camp out in the  barn.  So, he never really got over that. He made the best, and our daddy had  the respect of the people in the town. He was friendly and the people in  the town were friendly. He got a lot of support, but he grieved. I think he  never got over grieving, losing the home.  Did anything special burn up in the house?  There was a chair upstairs in a room that we just stored things in. It was  Governor Seay   s, territorial Governor Seay   s chair. He had lived here in  Kingfisher for a short time. They still have the Seay Mansion here. So,  we were going to give this chair   my dad didn   t want to give it away.  He thought it was worth too much money. But at some point when he  wasn   t here, we were going to give it to the museum or to the Seay  Mansion so they   d have an original piece of furniture. I don   t think they  had any originals. We have a picture of  the chair , and he valued that,  and we valued that.  It was  leather upholstered, kind of looked like an  office chair. It may have been his office chair.  Any family photos, pictures, records?  32  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Actually, there were a few that burned up, but I had been here and I was  afraid of a fire sometime getting to the house because there was so much  paper in it.  And the electrical system was very old in the house.  So, I had asked him for pictures and I would take them home with me  and make a copy, put the copy back in the frame, and keep the original.  So, I ended up with most of the important family pictures of dating back  to John Derius Hill   s family.  Did he know you were making copies?  Yes.  And putting the copies back?  I think he did, well, I don   t think he even cared. They looked good to  him. I felt good about it and he did, too, after the house burned down. I  still had all his pictures.  There wasn   t anything of monetary value in that house. The value was  sentimental value.  It was old furniture, a lot of junk.  We wondered what we would do with that house. Now, we don   t.  We hated  that it burned  down because it was so old and had history,  but we really couldn   t have maintained it or remodeled it up to par with  electricity inspection, up to code. It would have cost so much to do it,  and we didn   t have anyone that wanted to live here bad enough to do  that.  Wow. And how much longer did he live after the fire? Four more years?  From 2004 to April 2007, so that   s three more years. Part of that time, he  was in the nursing home because he fell.  We thought he would never come back to the farm.  But he set a date.  He was determined.  33  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  He wanted to be back home for harvest. He went into the hospital in  October or November. He went into an assisted living center in probably  December, late that year, of    04. Then in    05, he was in an assisted  living center. He kept telling them he was going home. They said,    If  you   ll get out of that wheelchair and start walking, you can go home.     So, he gradually got to where he could get up and hold on to the walls  and walk. By May, early May, he went home. He was here for harvest.  We thought he would get out and he would fall and that would be the  end of him, but he didn   t. If he fell, he got up. (Laughter)  He did fall that one time again.  But he managed to keep going. He really didn   t want any help here. He  wanted to do it himself, and so he did.  Well, I think it   s that love for the land.  Love of the land and pioneer spirit.  Yes. Talk to me a little about the fences on the property.  Well, originally, there were bodark posts used for fences. Probably some  post oak, but mostly bodark because that   s what trees we see out here  now. They are very sturdy posts and they don   t rot easily.  Crooked and ugly. (Laughs)  If you get around a bodark tree, you get scratched, but they cut those  posts up and made fences. They were the same fences that were still here  when he died. Even though there weren   t many strands of wire left and  might have been leaning, not very good fences at that time. But they  were barbed wire fences. They were built or put in back in John Derius  Hill   s time.  They planted those trees so that they would have them for fence posts.  And, too, bodark trees make kind of a thick underbrush around them and  animals can   t even get through them easy. That   s what the border was  out here along this road. So, it kind of made its own fence, too, even  though there was a fence.  Yes, the barbed wire could be nailed to the tree.  So, in 2007 we   or 2008, we started working toward getting new  fences, so it would help the liability situation, keep people out, keep  34  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  what needed to be in, in. Barbed wire fences are now here all around the  exterior, but there   s not many interior fences because there   s no  livestock.  As you   ll see on other farms in this area and other parts of the country,  they built a snow and wind belt of trees, cedar trees.  In the late 1940s and    50s, early    50s. Those trees have now kind of  gone to the wayside, but there are other trees that have taken their place  in there. So, there is still kind of a wind belt.  Like a shelterbelt?  Yes, shelterbelt is what it   s called.  This is not really what you would call a wooded area. (Laughs) And  when we came here one time   my sons grew up in a big city. We lived  in a Dallas suburb, and my son got out of the car when he was four and  he said,    Mom, the sky sure is big here     So, that tells you a lot about  the landscape around here.  What about the water source?  Well, the well where the windmill still stands, although one of the  storms blew the top of that windmill   what do we call it?  The blades? What   s the top of the fan called?  The veins and the blades fell off. We still have those, but you can see  where it was. That well was dug in 1892. It   s not very deep, maybe  twenty feet deep. It was used then for the house that was built in 1892  and the livestock tank was real close. Then, at some point, there was a  concrete storage tank built. Water could flow into that and be stored  there and be piped to the house.  That was our source of water.  That was our source of water, but some years and sometimes there was a  drought, dry times. We used about six inches of water in our bathtub to  take a bath. You didn   t ever fill it up, unless you were afraid pipes might  freeze. And they did a lot in the winter. Pipes weren   t very far under the  ground. The pump would freeze up sometimes. So, we just were very  conservative with water. If we knew it was winter and it might freeze or  there might be a leak, we would fill a big tub with water and some pails  and jars, and that   s what we used. In recent years, this last   it was about  a year ago, we had such a severe drought that the well really wasn   t  35  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  pumping hardly any water. So, we just, this year,  2011 , actually, the  end of  20 11, had someone drill a new well. So, we have a new well  and more water supply now. It   s deeper, like 120 or more feet deep.  Back then, we just took one bath a week, way back when we were little.  (Laughter) Well, I did. Momma made me on Saturday. (Laughter)  Would he have ponds on the property?  There was at one time real close to the house here, within four hundred  yards or something of the house, there was a pond that the livestock  drank out of. It now has filled in some, but there   s another pond at the  other far corner of the property down by a pasture that cattle could use.  That was dug out probably in the 1970s or something. It was a pretty  nice pond. This last summer with the drought, it dried up, too.  Not a place to go fishing or swimming. Red, muddy, muddy water.  (Laughs)  Well, with bath time, you missed out on the washtubs, right?  Yes, at least we had a bathtub. (Laughter)  There was an outdoor toilet here, which stood here until the house  burned. It leaned toward the later years, but there was always an outdoor  toilet behind the buggy garage.  One hole or two hole?  One.  Two. Was it one?  Oh, I think it was one.  I don   t remember.  Daddy would go in there sometimes and use it in later years. I was afraid  that was the way he would go. The thing would fall over and he   d go  with it. What a way to go. (Laughter)  So, tell me a little bit about decision-making in the family.  Well, the men in the family, clear back to great-grandfather Hill, made  all the decisions. I was told   I never knew him or his wife   but I was  told by his grandchildren that Mary Shaw Hill, his wife, never had a say  36  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  in the house as far as when it was built and how it was built. I think a  very quiet woman, but he made the decisions. Then my grandfather,  Herbert C. Hill, definitely made the decisions about what they spent  money on or what they did. My father pretty much did that, too.  Although they were both educated and my mother helped a lot and kept  the books and typed the reports and did a lot of that type of work.  Whether we bought new furniture, whether we bought a car, what we  did that day, it was his decision and pretty well centered around him.  What did your mom think about that?  It bothered her. But back in those days, you didn   t buck it. She didn   t  buck it at all. She just went along and did as best as she could.  Did they take a page out of the Depression? Did they ever buy anything  on credit?  No, they never did     The farm   Well, yes they did. They had to borrow money to buy the farm. They  probably had part of it and had to borrow the rest and paid it off during  those dry drought years because it was bought in 1941 or 1942.  I bought a car, financed a car, after I graduated from college and had a  job. My dad paid it off, and I didn   t want him to pay it off.  He didn   t want us to have any debt.  He couldn   t stand thought of the debt.  So, that   s the only thing I know he went in debt for.  Did he trust banks?  He did trust banks. There was one son of the original Land Run guy,  John Derius Hill, that lost all his oil money near Moore in an oil well. It  had to do with when he went to put it in the bank or had to do with the  bank. He lost all his money, but that   s the only story we knew of.  Otherwise   there was an old safe here. We found it after the fire, found  it after the fire and it had some of the records. That   s how I knew what  he paid for the farm. Some of the early tax records were in there. They  hadn   t burned   there were two doors into that safe. The safe was about  a yard high and maybe eighteen inch, square. It had an exterior of steel  and an interior compartment. That   s where those records were that  37  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  survived the fire. A little bit browned, but the building the safe was in  burned. We just had some guys come up and pick up scrap iron recently  and haul that off maybe a month ago or you could have had a picture of  it.  Would you notice county agents or home demonstration agents coming  by?  They did come out a lot because we had the registered Shropshire sheep,  and the 4-H boys bought registered Shropshire sheep, the FFA boys  bought them. My dad was friends with the home extension agents.  He was interested in working with them.  They worked with him, and he worked with them, and he did a lot of the  soil conservation things they promoted. So, there was a lot of  communication and education that went on back and forth.  I know your mom worked off the farm, but did she belong to a home  demonstration club?  She did. I don   t remember the name of it. And my grandmother did, too.  They would meet at somebody   s house once a month and somebody  would demonstrate like how to upholster a chair or maybe cook some  special     Or gardening. It had to do with gardening a lot of the time.  And were y   all involved with 4-H?  We were both in 4-H Club. I was in 4-H Club for at least two years and  showed a sheep and did home demonstrations and timely topics. We  showed our sheep. That   s what we showed, did the local thing.  And we had our little sewing project. My first one was the scarf that you  fringe the edges. I still have that. The next one was the handkerchief that  you hemmed the edges. On from there, it was just     I had a pin cushion. I still have the apron I made, full-length apron, and  little other aprons I made in 4-H Club. Then a dress, later. Had those in  the local fair contests. But we went to the local fairs a lot and to the state  fair because my dad was the vocational agriculture teacher. They were  showing sheep and things there that he had raised here on the farm so we  went and followed him around and got real tired.  38  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  We didn   t get to go on the midway. But we did go to the fair.  One time we went through the midway and you got lost.  I did get lost, and I was...  The Oklahoma State Fair.  Because I wouldn   t hold your hand. Some man came along and offered  to take me to the police station and I went with him. I waited at the  police station until they came and got me.  On the fairgrounds.  I thought that was a very, very big fair and a very scary place to be.  She was only like five or six, at the most.  The police station, they offered me a hamburger and I really wanted it,  but I was afraid to say yes. (Laughter)  Well, you mentioned a little about Christmas and the gifts you got  growing up. Did you celebrate any other holidays? Easter   ?  Thanksgiving was a big one because we usually had Hill family here at  Thanksgiving.  So, that would be a lot of people, a lot of cousins, and a lot of fun. Our  mother was the most gracious hostess.  We have a picture of her circling the table, seeing if anyone wanted  anymore hot rolls.  With an apron on, breezing by.  It wasn   t like you all went through and helped yourself. You may have  done that, too, but you passed the food and you made sure everybody  had what they needed. There were lots of cousins and they got to eat on  the back porch or wherever they could find a seat.  So, lots of cooking going on.  Lots of cooking and lots of dishes from other ladies that brought their  food. Yes, that was good. Christmas wasn   t as big a holiday. Our dad  wasn   t as much into celebrating Christmas. We did a little bit of that.  39  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Fourth of July?  No.  We weren   t allowed to go to town and watch that, but we were  outside   the old house had a flat roof over the front porch, and we could  go sit up there and see the fireworks from here, that were in Kingfisher.  Sometimes we   d go up there and lay down and we   d look at the stars.  That was a good memory, too.  Would you go to church at all?  Every Sunday.  We went to the Kingfisher Church of Christ. It was a little building,  small congregation. We   d have little friends there and sometimes they   d  come home with us on Sunday. Sometimes we   d have the preacher out  and     Have fried chicken.  Yes, always fried chicken and the trimmings.  It was fried before you went to church.  There wasn   t any of this coming home and then making dinner.  We had to make the gravy later, probably. My dad may have missed the  church service two or three times when there was harvesters out  harvesting. But we always went, even though he might have been with  the harvesting crew.  One of the things back then that people did was they had a container that  held drippings from like the bacon. That   s what they seasoned the  vegetables with.  Fried your potatoes, fried your okra in that deep bacon grease. The best  meal was the fried chicken with the drippings from the pan making  gravy. I learned to stir the gravy. Mother would say,    You stir the  gravy,    and I would just start out with what she put in, the flour and the  grease and she   d add a little milk and I   d stir. So, I was a pretty good  gravy maker. (Laughter)  Did you have a favorite meal she fixed?  That was it.  40  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  That was it?  For me. Fried chicken and gravy. I loved her gravy on bread. I put her  gravy on bread.  There was only one year when I was in school before my mother took a  teaching job. So, I remember getting off the bus, the school bus, after  school when I was in the first grade, and she had black-eyed peas and  cornbread ready for us. Then after that year, she went to work, so those  days were over for coming in to a hot meal.  We ate a lot of vegetables, a lot of black-eyed peas and cornbread.  A lot of fried potatoes.  Yes. Not a whole lot of beef, even though we had cattle. I never  remember eating sheep. They were show sheep. They were registered.  You could get more money out of them another way and that just wasn   t  our    And not much pork. My dad didn   t believe in eating much pork.  Our daddy was very nutrition conscious. Actually, our mother was, also.  So, I don   t know where the bacon grease came in because she didn   t do  that in later, at all. She would season her food with olive oil. He loved to  walk over the land and pull up these plants and he would tell the  nutritional properties of them. He   d say,    This is good for    Dandelions  are good for this       In later years, he tried to teach us things about that  and we just snickered at him, and didn   t pay any attention.  We sprayed our dandelions. Told him,    Don   t eat our dandelions,  they   ve been sprayed.    (Laughter)  Since then, I   ve gone to the nutrition store and I bought the same  nutritional supplements that he ate out of the ground. He liked to go to  the dairy in the later years when his health was failing. He would go to  the dairy, find a dairy that would sell him colostrum from the mother  cow. He would drink that, and he lived a lot longer than the doctors  predicted he would.  Actually, the reason he got the colostrum was he wouldn   t go to the  dentist. He would never go to the dentist. Well, he might go, but he  wouldn   t let them pull a tooth or do anything. So, he would get an  infection and his jaw would swell up. So, the dairy on the first corner  wouldn   t give him any milk because fear of making him sick and suing  them, liability. But he drove around until he found a man that would  give him some of the first milk that the cow produces for the calf, the  41  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  colostrum. He would put that in his cheek and hold it in there and that  swelling would go down and the infection would go away.  No kidding.  But the colostrum has properties not just for teeth. It has extreme  nutritional value. I   ve purchased it before. I have some, if you   re sick or  something. Immunities, it   s about immunities because it   s the first milk  that comes down from the mother cow. It helps her babies be  immunized.  He would walk through the wheat field and break off the head of the  wheat and rub it until it was just grain. Then he   d put it in his mouth and  chew it and make a gum out of it. Until the day he died, there was a jar  of wheat in the refrigerator and he would boil it and just eat it like a  cereal.  And he could tell the stage of the wheat and the readiness by chewing it,  also, the readiness for harvest.  The man that farms this now, my dad was his mentor. He  David  Kretchmar  just tells us now, even though he grew up on a farm, he said,     I learned everything I know from your dad.    My dad would walk out in  the field and say,    It   s at this stage or that stage,    of the wheat and  participated with this man that was learning from him. Later, that man  rented the land and that   s what he does now. He sure taught him a lot.  Any other home remedies he would employ?  I know my grandmother did the baking soda in water for kids, after  they   d been out and got poison ivy or whatever they got from being  outside. She would use baking soda.  Now, he did   this one is kind of extreme   but when mold grew on  something, he said that was penicillin. Our daddy could eat food that no  one else could digest. It did not make him sick     How often, if he got hurt or sick, would he see a doctor?  He would go in   he liked to go to the hospital better than he liked going  to the doctor. You now have to have a doctor put you in the hospital for  your insurance to pay. But he didn   t have Medicare Part B, so he   d show  up at the emergency room door more than he   d go to the doctor.  (Laughs) But he didn   t have anything against going to the doctor.  The last time he left this house, his last stay in this house, and the last  42  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  time he left this house, he really needed to be in the hospital, but he  really didn   t want to go. I was talking and the neighbor was talking to  him. Finally, he agreed to ride in the ambulance, but he said,    I don   t  want to ride in the back.    So, he rode in the front of the ambulance to the  hospital. (Laughs) He never made it back here.  Oh, man.  But his goal was always to make it back here.  Tell me about the challenges of agriculture through the years. Did you  notice anything especially in the    70s,    80s?  I don   t remember a lot in the    70s and    80s being bad. I wasn   t living  here, but back in the    50s, it was very hot. I remember the temperatures  getting up to 113. We had no air conditioning, and I remember laying on  the floor with a fan blowing on us in the coolest part of the house we  could find. It was just too hot for us to do anything else. I remember the  drought years, most recent drought years and hailstorms, most recent  hail. April 22nd, about two years ago or three years ago, in the spring we  had a freeze. I think that was spring before last. My dad had never seen a  freeze on April 22nd, I don   t think. It ruined the wheat. So, we   ve had  three crop failures for wheat. For three years in a row we   ve collected     he   s collected crop insurance.  It was always a risky business and still is.  Recently, I mean, the drought was pretty bad. Did y   all feel the effects of  that?  Oh, yes. In fact, this house, the walls kind of cracked. It was locked up  and empty.  And the wheat crop was poor. A poor yield.  And the well went dry, or pretty dry. So, it wasn   t a good place to live  during the drought.  Tell me what   s going on today on the farm.  Well, we have leased the farm to a man that, like I said a while ago, my  dad mentored him. He was just a friend to him and they were a lot alike  as far as their farming and being conservationists and conserving money  and neighbors and went to the same church. So, he rents this land and  does a good job with it. My daughter lives here and has a family of six  and is beginning to really like living out here. She   s never lived on a  43  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  farm, but she   s loving the farm now and enjoying the scenery and the  wheat fields. The green of that now changing to gold, quietness of it, the  privacy of it, she   s enjoying that. I have another granddaughter that  would like to live out here someday, so there   s hope that there will be  still family members here after us. We   d like to think there would be.  My dad always wanted there to be someone  living here . Actually,  when this became a centennial farm, he wanted us to continue working it  after he couldn   t anymore. We lived in the city and had our own jobs  and families there, so we didn   t. But now, there   s someone living here in  the family.  Our children will inherit this. We   d love to think about it staying in the  family, but we won   t have any control over that, at that time. So, maybe  some of them will maintain this land and keep it in the family.  So, looking towards the next hundred years, you hope it stays in the  family?  Yes, that would be nice.  We would like for it to. One son thinks it should be a hunting farm.  (Laughs)  I kind of don   t like that because it   s a farm for raising crops and cattle  and feeding the nation. It   s not really for pleasure, but I mean, it   s okay  to hunt on it. You can hunt on it, too, do both.  Does the farm hold sentimental value for y   all?  Definitely.  Yes, yes.  I feel an attachment to this land. I know my sons have that same feeling  of family and land and     Connection.     connection, importance of it. Probably the history of it means more to   us  than it does to our sons, but it will probably mean more to them in  the future.  I think it would be nice to save this history so that the ones that aren   t  born yet can go back and find out about their great-grandfather and the  pioneers.  44  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  We   re excited about being a part of your project so that we can maintain  the history.  As we move to the tail end of our interview today, any stories that we  may have missed? You mentioned something about the bucket.  Oh, we   d go out, when it was time to get the cattle in, we   d go shake the  bucket and    Sooie,    the cattle and they   d come running.  Another way to notify folks, how would you signal for     For dinner, when food was prepared for dinner, the noon meal, we   d go  out and wave a white rag or sheet or something in the air so they   d come  get it. They   d wash up outside at the cistern. That was another water  source I didn   t mention. On the back porch was a cistern that collected  rainwater. You could pump it in a little bowl and they could wash up  there before they came in to eat. I guess you could get a drink of water,  but I don   t think we did. Our drinking water was carried in buckets  because that was fresh and safer.  One thing I wanted to talk about was when we grew up here in the  country then, you always waved at the neighbors as they came by. There  weren   t that many. You went to this small community in Kingfisher, and  you knew the merchants and people on the street. It was a good feeling.  It   s still a good feeling when we go into Kingfisher because there is a lot  of old fashioned virtues and values that are still in place in this  community. So, we just have a pleasant experience when we come back  to visit.  I guess your neighbors have changed over time?  Yes, the Mason Dairy Farm took the place of the older people that  moved here in the early 1900s that we remember as children.  The generation of our parents, the age that many of them are even  younger than our parents, but they   re deceased. They   re all deceased  now. Our mother is the only one that   s still living of the original  neighbors here back when we were growing up.  Any lessons that your father or mother passed down to you that just  really stick out in your mind?  Don   t kill the goose that lays the golden egg. That was one Mother said  a lot. Save your money. Don   t squander it so you   ll have it when you  need to in your old age or for your health or for what   s important. Not  just a toy, wouldn   t hardly give the grandkids toys. We didn   t get any  45  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  toys. So, they saved. That   s what I remember. And the value of  education. Very, very important.  And the nutritional lessons that we learned that we   re just now  implementing in our own life. (Laughs)  My dad would like to say the garden was real important. He wanted the  children to learn how to do a garden, and eating fresh foods versus going  to the store and buying the junk.  When our economy has taken a downturn in the last few years, we   ve  considered   we have this farm. If we ever needed to come back here,  we could have a lot of one-acre plots out here. We could have the  mechanic, the doctor, the nurse, all the people we needed. (Laughter)  I guess my dad was the first one to go to A M College in Stillwater and  he encouraged his sisters and brothers and then their children, some of  them went there. It   s down to about the fifth generation now. So, lots  and lots have multiplied out.  It   s a good family tradition.  Yes, it is. (Laughter)  Where is your father buried?  He   s at Kingfisher Cemetery. There are quite a few Hill family members  there.  He really wanted to be buried on the farm, kind of, but he had     He bought the plot in town. He wanted to be buried there.  Is there anything else you   d like to add that we didn   t speak about  today?  I can   t think of much.  I think we covered most of it.  My dad wanted to keep the farm in the family, so we don   t want to sell  it. If we have to have money, we won   t sell the farm first. That won   t be  the first thing to go. But just a lot of the values they had back then and  reusing everything and not throwing anything away. Although, you have  to throw some things away that he didn   t. But that value of just not  wasting anything.  46  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Williams  Hempel  Nykolaiszyn  Hempel  Williams  For us, this was home, but to our children, it was a novelty. This farm,  because it was so different from the cities they grew up in.  But I still like to live on the edge of town or about where I can see the  skyline, the trees in the distance.  Seeing the sky is very important to me. The years I lived in homes where  I couldn   t see anything but the next rooftop, I didn   t like that.  I like to see the clouds rolling in and feel the wind blowing and the  things that you have here that you don   t have in town.  Do you still have family gatherings here at the farm?  We really haven   t because this house hasn   t been occupied since my dad  died. Really, he was living here alone and it wasn   t very presentable for  company. But future-wise, we may.  When we have family reunions, they come out and visit.  We planted three trees right in front of this house on the west to shelter it  from the west sun and as a place to be in memory of my dad and his dad  and his dad and the families that went before us so that someday we can  have a picnic out there under those trees. This is where the old house  was, that   s where they   re planted, right where the old house was.  But the extended family does like to come, the brothers and sisters and  grandchildren, our cousins. They do love to come out here and visit.  Herbert C. Hill   s family     We don   t actually feed people here, usually.  They have the reunion in Oklahoma City, and we invite all of them to  come out if they want to. I think last year, not many came, but usually  some of them do come out here because they remember the fond  memories.  Well, I can tell how much this farm means to you and your family. I  thank you so much for sharing it with us today.  Okay. Thank you.  Thank you for allowing us to do this.  47  Nykolaiszyn  Thank you.  -------  -------
