 Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also with me today is Tanya Finchum. We   re here in  Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, interviewing Floyd Akin Jr. along  with his wife Verna, and we   re here as part of the Oklahoma Centennial  Farm Families Oral History Project, and we   re going to talk about the  Bradburn-Akin Farm today. Floyd let   s begin with you. I   d like you to  tell me how your family came to Oklahoma.  Well, my grandmother on my mother   s side, they came from Texas up  here. My grandfather, Joe Bradburn, I really don   t know where he came  from, here. They were here in about 1896, about the year that most  people around all this country here came here, about, in    96. Then that   s  when he purchased part of the land here of forty acres in 1904. There  was other relatives that owned land around, adjoining this forty acres,  and he bought those out in a few years, I guess, after he got the, 1904  when he bought that. It eventually wound up as 160 acres and stayed  that way for clear up until we bought it.  He bought it from the one that homesteaded it, didn   t he?  I think he was the third owner of it there.  And why did they come to this part of Oklahoma? Any idea why they  settled here?  Well, not really. I don   t really know why they came here, but at that time  even my father   s folks came here. It just seemed like there was a  migration to the area in    96.  Were they farmers when they arrived, or did they have other  5  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  occupations?  My grandfather on my mother   s side, Joe Bradburn, he was kind of a  cow buyer and such as that. Farming has been with both sides of the  family. My father   s side and my mother   s side, both farming at that time.  It was small areas that they had. There was a lot of people only had forty  acres of land that they had to live off of or exist on.  Well, on that original forty acres, what was going on on the property?  Do you have any idea of where they were living?  Yeah, the forty acres that they bought, there was a house in the northeast  corner of what   d be the 160 later. There was a house there. Then when  they got the other land, they built this old house over here that   s just  north. That   s where I was raised in. They had two sons that helped build  the barn, and I   m supposing the barn was probably built in probably  1906 or    07, somewhere along in there. My grandfather and those two  boys built that.  There was also silos over there and the concrete base that   s still over  there north of the old barn. I never saw them or anything. I never did  hear anybody say, but they were built out of two grooved two-by-sixes.  How it was built, I don   t know. I guess they used a concrete base and  built up. I don   t know how long they used the silos, but they tore the  silos down and built the old farmhouse that   s over there. The walls and  such as that is that grooved two-by-sixes that came out of the silos, so it  was pretty solid walls that they were building. The house probably was  built somewhere probably about 1895,    6, somewhere along in there     no, it would   ve been after 1904. The house was probably built in about     07 or    8.  What crops and livestock were   what was the operation on the  property?  At the time then, they was farming. They farmed quite a bit of it and had  a few cows. Of course, it was all done by team. The land is uphill, and  it   s pretty red and wasn   t too good of land, but they had some cotton and  corn and hegari and stuff to feed what cattle they had. Normally they  didn   t have very many cattle and had that for the feed for the winter.  Now, where would they take their crops to market?  Well, all they ever had to sell was cotton, and they would take it to  Maud, to gin in Maud. They didn   t have really anything else to sell.  They always had some chickens. You take the eggs, and you took them  to town, and you swapped them for groceries. So actually wasn   t any  6  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  V. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  money changing hands. It was just swapping.  Did your grandparents have jobs off the farm, or did they work solely as  farmers?  Practically all this farming, as I said, he was a cow buyer.  Right.  Then in 1903 there was a telephone exchange. Remus Rural Telephone  Company was put in in 1903. Then he, Joe Bradburn, took it over in  1912, and they operated the telephone exchange out of the old  farmhouse, the one that   s there now. Switchboard sat in the corner. My  mother and her mother was the operators of that switchboard that was  over there.  We still have it. It   s in our son   s office in Shawnee.  That is neat. That   s neat.  They operated the telephone exchange and at one time had about 125  subscribers relay. They never made anything much out of it. They kept  it, my grandfather, they kept it until 1926, and in    26 they went to  Steamboat Springs, Colorado. At that time, there was a house across the  road from our house here now, an old house there that we lived in. When  they moved out, we moved over there to the old farmhouse there, and  my mother operated the telephone exchange then really from 1926 to     58, was when they sold that. It was more or less for community than it  was money. They never made any money out of it. Telephones were  fifty cents a month, and part of them never did pay even the fifty cents.  They were like that one on the wall back there where you turn the crank.  A lot of times they lost money because they had a line from here to  Maud to the exchange. Southwestern Bell had one line there. Anytime  you wanted to call out, you had to go by that line to Maud, and they got  it to where you wanted it to go to. Locally, of course, it was the same  thing. Two shorts and a long, or whatever the ring was with that ringer  on there. It might be yours. It was more donation to the community than  it was anything else. Had two sisters that helped out some after they got  big enough to help out. It wasn   t very busy at all, but it tied somebody  down most of the time.  Well, how did the farm pass from your grandparents to E. F. and  Grace?  7  F. Akin  V. Akin  Finchum  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  Inheritance. The 160 acres, there was five children of Joe Bradburn   s  involved there. The folks moved over there, and it still stayed in the  family with the heirs there until about 1960. Then I bought the other  heirs out. Then in    63 is when we built the house here. I was working at  Sinclair gas plant at Saint Louis. As far as any farming, there wasn   t any  farming took place with my part of it, just grass and cattle and pasture. It  stayed that way ever since.  They always had a huge garden and a truck patch down in the bottom,  you know, little patches here and there. There was work done around  here. (Laughs)  We   ve heard that phrase used before,    truck patch.    Can you tell us a  little bit about what that is?  Well, they truck it out of there and sell the produce in town or swap with  their neighbors. When you killed a hog, you didn   t have a deep freeze,  so you shared with your neighbor and they did the same with you, and it  worked out all right. Everybody had time to visit and sit on the porch  and wave. It   s a different world today.  We never did get electricity over to the old house until the early    40s, so  we never had electricity at any time. We had wood heating, and we were  always real good at not having any wood in time for a bad spell. You   d  have to go out and cut the wood when it   s snowing on the ground.  (Laughs)  Well, tell me a little bit about your parents.  Well, my father, he worked in the bank at Maud. He went to college in  Oklahoma City up there for a little while, but he worked in     He taught school, too.  After he worked in the bank, he taught school. He didn   t have all of that  education and all. He graduated from high school, and the county  superintendent asked him to go over and teach a little school that adjoins  us two miles over here called Dripping Springs. County superintendent  went to him and asked him to teach over there. Of course, he   d just been  out of high school that year. It was the first to eighth grade, and there  was several boys in there that was bigger and older than him, (Laughs)  but he never had any trouble. The superintendent told him, said,    Go  down there, and if you can   t have anything, but just        Order.  8  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin     order and all, just have order, and that   s it.    He said he never had a  lick of trouble with any of them. (Laughs) My mother, housewife, and  she was busy at that time, too, you know.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had two sisters and a brother.  And were they still very involved in the farm operation even though your  father had jobs elsewhere?  No, he never worked anywhere. He run the telephone exchange, keeping  it going, but he didn   t have a job anywhere else besides, after he quit  teaching.  Okay, so he was all farmer after he quit teaching.  That, and what we did is raise most of the stuff just for the cows that we  had. Milk cows was all we had, and it wouldn   t be over four or five milk  cows at a time. You milked and took the cream to town and sold it.  Sold the eggs.  Eggs was the same way. My mother always had about, oh, I don   t know,  thirty or forty chickens. On Saturday, take the eggs to town and swap out  that for groceries. It wasn   t any money changing hands. It was more  bartering than it was anything else. (Laughs)  Did what you were growing change when your parents started becoming  more involved in the farm? Were you still growing cotton?  When I was small, we raised some cotton and corn and some hegari to  feed stuff. Cotton is the only thing that we ever had to sell, and we took  it to Maud to the gin. That   s really the only sales that we had because we  used the corn and everything else. Had some hogs. We used everything  we raised as feed.  You   re sustaining the farm itself and sustaining the family.  No money involved, just a living.  Did you help pick cotton?  Yeah, I picked like everything, but I couldn   t ever get very many pounds  of it (Laughs) except get your fingers all skinned up.  9  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Well, what were some of your chores growing up? What would you have  to do to help out?  Well, I had to milk all the time. I plowed some. You walked with  everything except a cultivator. If you owned a cultivator you got to ride.  We never did have but one team, and at one time we had a horse and a  mule that worked together. Back in the middle and late    30s, Warren  Petroleum had a gas plant about three miles northeast of us over there.  They always blew a whistle at eight o   clock, twelve o   clock, one, and at  five. My dad bought a big ol    team of horses that had worked in the oil  field all the time. They were big outfits. One of them died, but one of  them could pull a turning plow as easy as   not as big as they were. You  could be plowing with that rascal, and at five o   clock when they blew  that five-o   clock whistle over at that Warren plant, he stopped right then,  and you couldn   t make him work anymore. He knew what that whistle  was. (Laughter) You just as well unhook him and bring him to the house  because he was done. I thought that was really something that he  remembered that. Just the minute it blew, he stopped. (Laughs)  Well, as a young man can you describe the house for me where you  lived, your house?  Well, it was built out of the lumber of that silo, a big part of it. It had a  concrete floor in it. In the hot summer and such, had a hallway there, and  you could lay down on that concrete. It was pretty cool if you could get  a little breeze through there. It was five rooms: two bedrooms, a dining  room, kitchen, and front room. The telephone exchange was in the front  room in a corner there. We didn   t have any radio or anything at all until  kind of the middle of the late    30s. We had an old radio then, and it was  a battery. You   d take that battery, and you   d have to take it to town to  get it charged, fifty cents. Then bring it back and run the radio until it  run down. (Laughs) You had to be kind of careful with your radio and  how much you used it.  Where was your bedroom?  It was in the northeast corner of it there. It also had an upstairs there,  kind of a attic deal, and we had one bed up there. Sometimes I   d sleep  up there, sometimes in the northeast corner of it. We were heating with  wood, and by morning it was cold as can be. You   d put quite a bit of  wood in the stove at bedtime, but it didn   t last very long there.  And how about the indoor plumbing?  It didn   t exist. (Laughter)  10  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  The windmill was right at the back door.  The windmill was there and a hand pump right at the back door. The  toilet was a little bit to the west. It was a WPA  Works Progress  Administration  toilet. It   s still over there. We had to pump water for the  cows and those things. There wasn   t any bottom from them drinking.  They could drink from now on with you pumping on the hand pump. We  had all right times by pumping on it. We didn   t get a farm pond until  about 1940. Daddy got a farm pond built so that took care of, pretty  well, the water situation on pumping it. We never had indoor water at  all, anytime.  Was the WPA toilet a two-seater or a one-?  One.  Was it?  It was one of those pretty cast steel that   s floor, and it comes up. There   s  an old one laying out there that somebody had, I   ve got there. That one  at the old house over there, the house is there and the toilet seat and all  that.  What about bath time?  Bath time?  Yes.  Pretty few and far between. (Laughter) One tub had to wash several of  them. You couldn   t be changing water all the time. Too much problem  to try to get it and heat it.  Was there a garden?  Yes, always had pretty much of a garden and then that truck patch down  east there. My mother always canned a lot of stuff, so we had canned  stuff all winter long. Many a time we   d sit down at the supper table, and  she   d say,    The only thing we got on the table that was bought was sugar  and salt and pepper. Everything else was raised.    (Laughs)  Did you have a favorite meal she cooked?  Oh, supper was always the main meal that we had.  What would she cook for you?  11  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  F. Akin  Oh, golly     Had chicken a lot.  Yeah, we always had chickens, so we had quite a lot of chicken. It   d be  stuff she   d canned, green beans and stuff that was raised during the  summer and canned, tomatoes.  Corn.  Who was responsible for killing the chickens?  Well, she did. She wrung their neck. I was kind of small. It looked so  easy that I thought I could do that, so we was out there, and she had  killed one, I think. Of course, they wrung their neck, you know. Well, I  tried one of them there. I got ahold of him, I slung him around like  everything, and turned loose of him. He hit the ground a running and run  to the chicken house, and that was it. (Laughs) I was just winding him  up. I never did break his neck. (Laughter) He didn   t hang around very  long.  He got out of there. You mentioned that a lot of farming, especially in  the earlier years, were done with a team. At what point did you get a  tractor?  He didn   t. (Laughs)  Did you ever get a tractor?  Tractor? Oh Lord, no. No, never had a tractor on there until after I  bought the place over here, and that   d been in the late    60s.  Wow   That first tractor, I   ve still got it. With the tractor, really all we ever did  with it was mostly brush hog because there wasn   t any plowing. We  didn   t plow with it or anything. Didn   t use it for farming; it was mostly  clearing.  Okay.  Let   s back up. When were you born? What year were you born?  Twenty-four. You can add that up  (Laughter)  12  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  And you graduated high school?  At Maud. Both of us graduated at Maud at the high school.  Nineteen thirty     Forty-two is when I graduated. Got right out of it into the Army, and I   d  never been away from home a day in my life. I was inducted on my  nineteenth birthday, February 3 of    42. I spent three years in the Army. I  was gone from home thirty months before I ever got to come home. I  never had a furlough at any time. It was just a weekend pass is all that I  had then. Always seemed like everywhere I went   I was lucky.  I went into radar. At that time, they said,    You   re in radar.    I   d never  heard the word. I didn   t even know what it was. I was down at Saint  Petersburg, Florida. They had a school down there, and it was top secret.  You wasn   t even supposed to even mention the word    radar    anywhere  at all and such as that. We had about a two-month school down there.  You couldn   t get a leave because we was a hot outfit and headed to the  Pacific. We were the first radar trained in the United States that went to  the Pacific. We were the first crew that ever went over there. Well, we  got over there, there wasn   t any chance of any furloughs or leaves or  anything at all.  It was a funny thing. Lyle Boren, he was a congressman then, David   s  daddy. He was over around Maud down in Bowlegs and down in there.  He wrote me a letter after I was overseas and just wanted to know how  things were and how things were going and such. That   s just more or  less questionnaire about it. Well, I answered it, and he turned right  around and sent me another letter. We wrote back and forth quite a bit. I  have probably about fifteen letters from him. In    45 I wrote a letter, and  I asked if he had any vacancies for West Point or any of that. I got a  letter back and said at that time he didn   t have any vacancy. It wasn   t but  two or three weeks later I got a letter from him. He said,    I found that  I   ve got a third alternate appointment to West Point, and I   ve already put  your name down. I hope this agrees with you.    Lord, me over there for  thirty months, I never seen home, knowing that he was going get to  come back to the States. You never even questioned about that.  The next day or two they had me on a plane, and I came to San  Francisco and then on train and to Ithaca, New York, to Cornell  University. They had a prep school going. It was already in progress, so  there wasn   t any chance of a leave or anything of that sort. After that,  actually wound that school up, they sent us down to West Point. I was  down there about six or eight weeks taking tests, physical and mental  tests, all. Went through a heck of rigmarole down there. There wasn   t an  13  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  opening in what I was sent up there for as third alternate. There wasn   t  an opening that came up, so they took all of those people there. Of  course, there was a lot of them because there was about four people to  fill one position. Man, they were particular, too. If you had lost three  teeth, you couldn   t get in, and I had two teeth missing. (Laughs) They  were really strict.  I went down to West Point, and I saw pretty quick it gets stricter down  there yet. (Laughs) They took all of us then and sent us to OCS  Officer  Candidate School . Well, the colonel that interviewed me had all my  records, and you had choices. He said,    Son, you haven   t been home  since you went in the Army.    I said,    No.    That was thirty months then.  He said,    How far is Fort Sill from your home?    I said,    About 110  miles.    He said,    I think it   d be damn nice if you was down there.     (Laughs) The next morning I was on a train headed to Fort Sill. Then I  couldn   t get to come home because it was already in progress, the  school. I had to wait three or four weeks before I could even get a  weekend pass to come home. Seemed like everything I got into was a  hot outfit. (Laughter)  Well, how did you two meet?  I lived in the same community south of here. The school was the center  of the society in the country, and we knew each other from the school,  and not well. I just knew who he was until he came back from the Army.  Then it was a different thing. (Laughs)  Did you two start dating at that point?  Yes.  Yeah, after I got back from the Army.  Okay.  See, I was in the Army from my nineteenth birthday to the twenty-first  and in an area that most of them were dating and marrying at that time.  Of course, you missed out on all that area there.  Well, what were you hoping to do once you got out of the Army?  I really didn   t have   I had the opportunity to go to college for four years  of college. A brother-in-law of mine, he said they was doing some hiring  down there at that Sinclair gas plant. I went down there and interviewed,  and they hired me right off the bat, the first job that I ever had, the first  time I ever even applied for a job. I went to work there in, it would   ve  14  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  been    45, December of    45.  And where were you based out of?  Right here.  Okay.  Saint Louis is where the gas plant was. A gas plant doesn   t move.  Production moves around quite a bit. Gas plants don   t. I went to work,  and they said,    I don   t know why you want to go to work here. We   re  going to shut the thing down any day.    Well, I hung around forty years  and retired, and still didn   t shut it down for three or four years after I  retired. I worked out of Seminole and Saint Louis, both.  When did you two get married? (Laughter)  Nineteen forty-seven.  Okay, and after you got married, where did you live?  We lived at Dripping Springs, that he was talking about a while ago. We  bought the old teacherage and lived there fifteen years. Then we built  this house, bought this land, and moved over here.  We had three boys, and they were raised pretty well over there. They  helped here after we moved over here, too.  Well, when the farm came into your hands, did you make any changes?  Did you do anything differently?  When we bought it and moved over here, there wasn   t anything but  pasture, anyway, and we had cows. That   s all we ever had. Had a pretty  good garden at that time, but farming, never did do any. Just pasture.  And how many acres, because I know you acquired many different  properties? How many acres did you end up with?  The Bradburn place was 160 acres, which we bought the other heirs out.  Then I bought a eighty and a fifty that joins it, so it   s 210 acres now. It   s  been that since probably about    70, so it   s been 210 acres then.  So what   s happening on the farm today? Are you still running cattle?  No, too much of a chore for me. (Laughter) I lease it out, and a neighbor  over here has cattle on it. I haven   t had any cattle now in, what, four or  15  Finchum  F. Akin  V. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  five years. I got afraid that, you know, they   re gentle and all, but feeding  them all, you get knocked down such as that. I was afraid I was getting  more feeble along, anyway, and afraid to get a hip broke or something.  Decided the best thing to do was get rid of the ones I had and lease it out  then.  Any mineral rights?  Yes, under the 160, I think there   s four acres. (Laughter) They   ve drilled  some wells, that is after the heirs sold everything out. There was a well  drilled while it was still 160 and owned by the heirs. Well drilled over  there, and was a pretty good well. I got a little royalty money there. Our  part now is down to nothing.  We had a huge pond built, (there   s a picture of it) and we   ve sold water  out of that pond. It   s better than an oil well. (Laughs)  Wow.  Yeah, it   s a large pond. It   s probably two and a half, three acres, when  it   s full. They   ve done a lot of drilling down around here and sold frack  water and groundwater for it.  Was there ever a time when you thought you would lose the farm?  No.  Well, were you involved with FFA  Future Farmers of America  or 4-H?  4-H, was in 4-H when I was in grade school, but that was the only time.  And were your boys?  Yeah, they   let   s see. Gary was in 4-H quite a bit and FFA, wasn   t he?  Yeah, he raised some calves and showed them at the county fair and like  that.  We have three boys. The oldest one, he graduated from East Central at  Ada, taught, and only retired last year. The middle boy went to  Weatherford to school some, and they went to some school in New  Mexico, didn   t they, out there a little bit? I don   t know that he ever got  a   didn   t get a degree in anything, did he?  I don   t know. He finished. I   m sure he got a degree, but I don   t know  what it was. He went to East Central first, and then he wanted to be a     16  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  V. Akin  Finchum  Pharmacist.     pharmacist.  That   s why he went to Weatherford.  Then he fell in love and got married, and he just wanted out of school.  Then he went to Weatherford.  The youngest boy, he   s a OU graduate and     He   s an attorney.     he wanted to be a lawyer. He wanted to be a lawyer from the time he  was in high school. He was determined. Well, he graduated from OU. Of  course, he   d go to law school at OU, but the professors there told him,  said,    Why don   t you try to go to Texas law school. It   s the best law  school in the area at all.    See, Texas has a ruling that only 15 percent of  people can be out of state. He sent all of his material to Texas down  there.  You have to be in the top 10 percent of your class from OU to even be  considered.  So he sent this material to Texas, and he got a letter back, and they said,     You can consider yourself mighty lucky that we will accept you.    So he  went to law school at Texas, and while he was going to school, he was  working for a firm there, too, some. He worked for them for a good  while and then went out on his own. Then decided to move to Steamboat  Springs, Colorado. He operates from there and has a law office in  Austin.  And also in Denver.  Yeah.  And that   s where your grandparents went, too?  Yeah, I don   t know why that had to do with it or not, but     He   d been out there with us when he was still in high school. They liked  to ski, and I don   t know why, but they settled on living out there.  What took your grandparents out there?  17  F. Akin  Finchum  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Where?  Why did they go?  Why did they go?  Why did they go? My grandfather, Joe Bradburn, had a brother that was  at Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and had a Ford agency out there. My  grandfather was kind of in poor health, and they decided to go out there.  They bought a Standard filling station and operated it for a good many  years. I think it was in    31 when he died. I don   t know whether that is  why Rick, our youngest boy, went out there or what. You can call him.  He answers all the time. They communicate back and forth, Austin and  him. He went to some of his clients and asked if he went out on his own  and also that far away if it   d matter. They said,    We don   t care where  you   re at. Just so you do our business, we don   t care where you go.     He   s been real successful out there.  And your grandparents went in the    30s?  In    26.  Before the Depression.  They were out there in    26, and I think he died in    31. He had two sons.  They operated the station there for several years and eventually moved  back here in the latter part of their life.  Well, how have your neighbors changed through the years?  There   s not very many anymore. (Laughter)  Kind of few and far between.  This man he was talking about up here, Jiggs Pratt, he   s the only old  neighbor that   s still here. The Goodins down here, their family   s been  here forever, but most of the rest of them are somebody new. Like I say,  there   s not very many of them.  There   s some that live not too far down there that I don   t even know  who they are or where they work or anything at all. It   s so much  different than when I was smaller and all we had, of course, a grade  school named Remus down here. That   s where both of us went to grade  school. At that time the school was pretty well the center of the whole  community, and they always had something going there. You knew the  people around, was acquainted with them. This day and time, there   s no  18  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  V. Akin  contact whatsoever with the neighbors hardly.  And the town of Maud has changed a little bit, too, I think.  Oh     Yes, it   s gone down.     like a ghost town.  In    29 when the boom was here, they said that Maud was 10,000  population.  We moved here in 1935, and it was still a good town then. My dad was  working for the Chevrolet agency, and there was a Ford agency and  Plymouth, I think. It was a good town then, three or four drugstores, lots  of grocery stores. There   s just nothing there. Even our grocery store quit.  There   s a dollar store, two gas stations, and a bank, post office. That   s  about it.  Back in 1893 there was a town of Remus. It was only a quarter of a mile  south here. My folks remembered it. At one time they had three doctors  there and several stores.  Lodge.  The Second Masonic Lodge was there for the county here, for the area.  After the railroad came into Maud, then everything from here went to  Maud then. It was about, I think in 1908 it pretty well wiped out the  town of Remus then.  Was there a depot?  No. The railroad come through Maud, and that   s what really changed  things up. They went to Maud to be the depot there, the railroad.  Then when did the railroad leave, or is it still come through?  No.  No, it   s been out   gosh.  Before you were in high school, or was it still here?  No, just maybe ten years ago.  19  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  Finchum  F. Akin  How many?  Ten.  Oh, no, further than that. I   d say thirty years there hasn   t been any. They  pretty well cut everything off from about Shawnee back to the east,  about cut everything off there on the railroad. They still operate some  from Oklahoma City to Shawnee, but that   s as far as they go. There   s  always been talk about trying to extend it to Wewoka, but whether it will  ever exist or not     We talked a little bit about work when you were younger. What would  you do for fun growing up?  Of course, when we was growing up, Saturday night everybody went to  town, and you had to get there early to even get a parking place on Main  Street, everybody visiting with one another. Every Saturday night, well,  you could count on that.  There was a movie theater in Maud at that time.  Yeah, there was at one time, I guess, two or three movie houses there.  Then there was a community. We had pie suppers and different things  going on in the community itself.  Well, how would you get to school?  I walked down here about a quarter of a mile (now, this is high school)  and met the bus down there. The grade school, the eight years on it,  walked from here a mile and a half, about a mile and three-quarter, south  to grade school.  One way?  One way, uphill, both ways  (Laughter) I didn   t think a thing about it,  but the old roads then were no gravel, and this red mud out here is the  worst that I ever saw. It   s just like bubblegum: you get it on your feet,  and it just keeps balling up more and more and more. You have to put up  with that every time it rained. It was a mess, I   ll tell you.  How often would you get new shoes for school?  Usually about once a year you   d have   when I was pretty small these  booties came out that lace up to there. I was dying for a pair of them, but  I had to wait I don   t know how long. I think they were about six or eight  dollars, and we never did have the money to buy them there, but I  20  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  V. Akin  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  F. Akin  Nykolaiszyn  V. Akin  always wanted those booties. I finally got one pair of them. (Laughs)  Was keeping the farm in your family very important to y   all for so long?  Yeah.  Was to him, anyway. His sisters and his brother went different  directions, but he stayed with the homestead.  Well, it all worked out. I couldn   t have picked it any better than the way  it worked because of my job down there and living here and never  having to move for forty years there. Very few people can do that, have  one job for forty years and never move. The only move we did was from  over there to over here to build the house, two miles.  Well, when you look at the farm and what   s going to happen in the next  hundred years, what do you think is going to happen? What do you hope  to happen?  Well, I don   t know. None of the kids would live here, I don   t think, but I  think yet they probably would hold onto it as a farm and have it in the  family somehow, or maybe most of it or something. As far as them  living here, I don   t think they would.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to add today before we close on  out?  Well, I don   t know. We   ve covered quite a bit. (Laughter)  Well, we thank you for your time today. Thank you so much.  Thank you.  -------  -------
