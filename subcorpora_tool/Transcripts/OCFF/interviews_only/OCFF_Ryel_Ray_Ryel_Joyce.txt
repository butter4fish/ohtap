 Finchum  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  Today is November 14, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today  we   re in Aline, Oklahoma, to speak with Joyce and Ray Ryel? Ryel?  Yes.  And this is part of our Centennial Farm Families  Oral History  Project , so thank you for having us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start with having you tell us what you know about how your family  came to own the property to begin with.  Go ahead.  No, it   s your family.  Well, actually, I guess there   s a couple of stories. We heard that my dad  had said that this wasn   t achieved actually in the Land Run, but my  Great-Grandpa Watson traded a set of mules and a wagon for this land.  They farmed it for, well, until he died, and then my grandpa Ryel, Ralph  Ryel, took over the farming, and in 1970   well, my Grandma Ryel was  a Watson     Okay.     and the Ryels came actually from Wiley, Colorado. They had some  land up there and somehow traded this for that up there. That   s kind of  how the Ryels got into it, and they have owned it ever since.  So the Watson was your great-     5  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Was my great-grandfather.  And what was his first name?  His first name was John, and his wife   s name was Selena?  Selena.  Selena.  Yes.  And how many children did they have?  They had three girls and a boy. All of the girls left here, and the boy, he  went to Oregon. My grandma stayed here, of course. She got married to  Ralph Ryel, and her name was Lottie.  Little bitty, tiny lady. I knew her. She was still alive when we got  married. She wasn   t five foot tall and didn   t even weigh a hundred  pounds but was quite the lady. Anybody in town that needed anything,  she   d give them the shirt off her back. She was just that kind of person.  They took people in. She raised foster kids. She was a ball of fire.  And they had, what, nine children. I have an aunt that is the only living  one left. All the rest of them have been deceased.  If there were nine children, how did your father come to have it out of  the others?  Well, he owned a farm a mile and three-quarters south of here. That   s  where I was born and raised was in Major County which is just across  the Alfalfa County line. When my grandparents passed away, he was  farming this because his brothers were, one of the brothers was a farmer  up around Cherokee.  One was a minister.  One was a minister, one done custom cutting. One of them moved to  Wichita and worked at Boeing. The girls, one of them went to California  and got married out there. Then the other one stayed here, which she   s  still alive. Her name is Inez Marshall, right? She lives in the fellowship  home in Fairview, Oklahoma.  But your dad was the only one that really was interested in continuing  6  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  the farm.  Yes, so when they divided everything up, they sold it to him for thirty-five  thousand dollars in 1979, wasn   t it?  Yeah, somewhere like that.  Something like that. Might   ve been     No, it   d be before that because we got married in    73.  He owned it before I graduated high school, probably   1969, I think, is  when they sold it to him. When he passed away, we bought it from our  mother. She lived to be eighty-eight, and my dad died at seventy. She  lived to be eighty-eight, and we have lived here forty years now.  We moved out here about six months after we got married.  And you got married when, then?  Seventy-three, 1973.  At night, we got married at night. (Laughter)  In the dark.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  Yes, I have two brothers, an older and a younger, and both of them live  in Enid.  Not interested in farming?  No, they wasn   t interested.  What   s even better is our youngest son lives about five miles from here,  and he helps his dad farm. We have one that   s continuing that tradition  of making something from the soil, the farming.  We   re just small farmers, though.  Was the farm originally eighty acres or a hundred and sixty?  A hundred and sixty.  A hundred and sixty.  7  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Yeah, and the house was right here where we   re at. Several years ago we  dug a storm shelter, and when they were digging that out they found  some of the brick from the old dugout that was originally here. I have  one of the bricks in my cabinet in there. This is where it all started.  When we moved up here, there was an old cellar out there, and that   s  where his dad slept when they were kids. The boys would sleep down in  the cellar because it was cooler. We ended up having to fill it in because  it was, you know, crumbling and stuff. The horse tank, there   s a horse  tank out there. I   m sure you saw the windmill when you drove up. That   s  original to the farm. Then there was a milk house, and so the water  would go from the windmill through the milk house to keep the milk  cold, and it   d run into this big cement horse tank out there. It actually  has Great-Grandpa Watson   s initials and the year 1912 where he wrote it  when they poured that spot tank. It   s pretty cool.  So as far back as you can remember, what were some of the products,  produce and things, that was produced here on the farm?  Well, here just south of where our house is, they had about a twenty-acre  patch of alfalfa, and the rest of it was pretty much wheat and cattle like  we do now. As sandy as the ground is around here, that   s about all that  you can raise. We can try milo and stuff, but without irrigation systems  it   s almost a bust. It doesn   t work very well.  Where would they take their things to market?  To Aline.  And that   s just, what, two miles from     Four and a half.  Four and a half, as the crow flies?  As the crow flies. (Laughter)  It used to blow really bad. Your dad talked about how when they planted  the shelter belt out there, they did that as an erosion measure. That row  of trees out there was planted by your dad when he was little?  I don   t think so. I don   t remember when that   I wasn   t here when they  planted that. It had to have been planted before then because remember  we found those artifacts out there in the shelter belt of the Civil War.  We found a bayonet out there.  8  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Aline is considered on the Mason-Dixon Line, and we actually found a  bayonet (it was in relatively good shape) in that shelter belt out there.  His dad and the boys were out there exploring. It makes you wonder  what happened here on this land, the stories that we don   t know that, you  know, probably somebody does, but     Well, as a young child would you come visit your grandparents here?  Well, we only lived a mile and a half from them, and we seen them  about every day. We always had, as long as they were alive, we always  had Sunday dinner with them.  And what would be the food?  Chicken and noodles.  Homegrown chickens?  Oh, yes, homemade noodles, and my grandpa usually done the cooking  on Sundays.  Was that the grandpa that would eat dessert first?  No, that was on the other side.  He had one grandpa that he always had dessert first.  Can you describe that house to us?  Yeah, it actually sat east and west, and all on the north side were  bedrooms. It was a three-bedroom home with one bath on the north side.  The center bedroom had two beds in it, and it was the biggest room in  the house. Then as you came in the back door was the washroom, a big  cement washtub thing to wash up for dinner. As you walked into the  kitchen just to the left of the   as you walked in was where you went  down into the cellar. The kitchen was not very big. In fact, this here was  in the kitchen. Then from there you went into the dining room, and that   s  where my grandpa always sat in front of the old wood-burning stove and  made his own cigarettes.  Of course, my grandma would sit at the dining room table, and every  day she would write what went on. I don   t know whether we still have  all that stuff or not, but she would have a daily diary of what went on  that day and who she seen. Then they had, actually, a formal living room  9  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  where they kept all of my grandpa   s musical instruments. He played the  banjo and the fiddle, (I don   t know what that other instrument was  called) and then my grandma played the piano. When electricity came  available they had the house made for electricity and running water.  When my dad was growing up,    running water    was to take a bucket out  to the pump and pump it, and run back to house as fast as you could.  (Laughter)  And how did they do bath times? Bath time in those days     Bath time in their day was in a     Galvanized tub        galvanized tub        which we have still, which is pretty cool.     until they put the bathroom in the house. When the dugout was there,  they didn   t actually   I don   t know whether they actually lived in the  dugout, but I know my great-grandparents did. It was like a little two-room  thing made of brick with a straw top. Dad did tell me, during the  Dust Bowl, which went on in the   30s, he said they used to hang burlap  sacks over the windows, wet them, and by nightfall they would be mud.  That   s how bad the dust was. It wasn   t as bad here as it was further west,  but it was still pretty bad.  I remember the stories of when they built the shop out there. Everybody  loved to come here because of the music. They had a barn dance out  there, and so they played music and had all the neighbors come over  because there was several Ryels that lived around here.  Yes.  His cousin, Marvin, your dad   s cousin, Marvin lived, what, a mile from  where you grew up     Yeah, mile and a half.     mile and a half, yeah, so     How did they learn to play?  I really don   t know. Probably just had a natural feel to do it, I guess. I  never did ask.  1 0  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  Had they moved here from, your great-grandparents, they came here  from     Ireland.  Well, then, that may have something to do with     That   s where they came from. My Grandpa Ryel, the Ryels, came from  Germany because my grandmother was red-headed. How they ended up  meeting, at that, I do not know, but I do know how my dad and mother  met. My dad was shot in the war. He was in the Korean War, wasn   t he?  I don   t remember.  Whichever one it was. Sometimes my mind don   t work very well. She  only lived   they actually went to school together at a county school  which was just a mile east of here.  Round Grove.  She lived a mile north of there, and he lived a mile west of the school.  Of course, he always picked on her when they were in school. When he  went off to war, when he got shot, was in the hospital, she started  writing to him, and that   s kind of how they got together. Then they  moved here, and we lived in a rent house south of here for two years  until they got their home built in 1952.  So you were born when?  I was born in 1941.  Fifty-one.  Fifty-one, excuse me. (Laughter)  I know he   s old, but he   s not that old.  So they would   ve gotten married in the   40s sometime?  Forty-seven     Yeah, that sounds right because your brother was born in        because my brother was born in    49, my oldest brother.  So that would make it World War II, then.  1 1  J.

Ryel  Something, like I say, I can   t     I have to work backwards in order to figure it out.  That   s fine. See, you   re testing me.  Yeah. (Laughs)  I have to work backwards. And you graduated from high school in     I graduated from high school in 1970.  From Aline?  From Aline-Cleo. I went to school at Cleo for   where I grew up, we  were in the Cleo school district, and when we moved, well, when they  decided to take all the little county schools and make one     That   s when you were a senior?  No, that   s when, actually, I was a junior because I was the second  graduating class from Aline-Cleo     Consolidated?     and there was fourteen in our class. Wasn   t a very big school.  Did you do 4-H?  Yes, 4-H at Cleo, and then when we moved and did Aline-Cleo FFA,  had FFA there.  His dad always had a dairy, so you showed dairy cattle at 4-H.  Well, then, we should back up, then. If your dad   how many cows did he  have at the dairy?  Probably, I   m going to say, about thirty head.  And what were some of your chores?  Milking cows. We did it for   probably until I was about fifteen, we  milked them all by hand. Then he got a vacuum milker, and we set that  all up and probably sped it up about twice as fast. When I was fifteen,  I   m going to say we probably only milked about twelve cows, but when  1 2  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  he got the milking system, he had a bulk tank. He sold that milk to the  Watonga Cheese Factory. He wanted to go Grade A, but then he  would   ve had to have completely redone everything, so he sold Grade C  milk which they made cheese and other products out of it. They   d have a  truck come and pick it up.  Of course they used it for their own use.  Yeah.  I was a city girl when I married Ray, and we have the actual cream  separator that was passed down from his grandparents, I think, to your  parents. His dad and mom taught me how to   we had milk goats when  our kids were little, and so we   d separate the cream and do all that. We  have the actual cream separator that still works. His dad taught me all of  that, how to use it, how to make it work and stuff, which was very cool.  Did the dairy have a name?  No.  Would you have to get up and milk before school?  Oh, yes, and when we got home from school.  Twice a day.  Yes.  Rest of the time they had horses and played, didn   t you? But you had to  work the fields, too, drive a tractor and     Yeah.  Was your dad   s primary source of income farming?  Yes, but now since he was shot in World War II, he did draw a  government pension because he was disabled. He had very little use of  his left leg. I mean, he could walk without crutches or stuff, but he had a  lot of pain in his left leg.  Did your mother work to supplement income?  No, she did not. She was strictly a housekeeper, which she probably did  more work than   . We raised and butchered chickens and butchered our  own pigs and cows. She would go to town once in a while and buy a few  1 3  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  staples, and that was about it.  Well, had your grandfather worked off the farm, or was his primarily  farming?  No, all he ever done was farm. Of course, my dad, all he farmed was  two   well, when he really got started, my grandpa was renting a couple  extra farms and this one. He had what they called an old Twin City  Minneapolis-Moline (M and M) tractor with steel wheels. That   s what  he farmed with, which would pull about a 314 plow. When my dad was  growing up, before my grandpa got that tractor, team and horses. When  they would harvest, there was a   actually my other grandpa on the other  side had a thrashing machine, and that   s what his income was from.  They would park it at a field with the old endless belts. My dad   s job  was to run the team and horses and the wagon, and hauling the shocked  wheat to the thrashing machine, pull it up there, and put it on into the  thrashing machine. He was probably, maybe, eight or nine years old, but  that was his job. One evening when he went to put the horses up,  something spooked them. The barn door was only big enough for one  horse at a time, but both of those horses got in through that door at the  same time which tore the wagon up. He had to fix it because he   s the  one that tore it up.  Actually that corncrib out there used to be two corncribs, and that   s  where they   d drive through to unhook the horses. Isn   t that right?  Yeah.  And then they had a big barn.  Yeah, that burnt down twice. (Laughs) When my dad was little, (I   m  going to say probably about five or six) him and his two sisters were  pretty close to the same age, and their job was to take care of each other.  The story was that they were out back behind the barn smoking corn  cobs. (Laughter) Somehow, don   t know for sure whether the match got  away from them or they decided somebody was coming and they  throwed the corn cobs down, but, anyway, the barn got caught on fire.  My Grandma Ryel always kept telling me that my dad come running and  hollering,    Call the police  Call the police     (Laughter)     The barn   s on fire  Call the police      Then in 19   what was it? They rebuilt the barn. They rebuilt the barn,  and it was sitting here when we lived here. Almost fifty years to the  date, it burned down again.  1 4  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  Electrical. The kids had some show lambs. All our kids have been  involved with 4H and FFA, and we had some lambs in there. Something  electrical started the fire, so it burned down.  I say, almost fifty years to the date that it burned down when my dad  burned it down.  Well, when something like that happens, there   s not a fire station close  enough by     Well, there wasn   t when he was little, but we did call Aline, and they  come out and   .  Made sure that the other buildings didn   t burn.     made sure the other stuff didn   t     It   s all volunteer fire departments.     didn   t burn down. Best thing when that happens is just let it burn, and  then you don   t have near as much junk to pick up. (Laughs) Then we  rebuilt about half of it so that the kids would have a place for their  animals and stuff.  Where would you have to get your lumber?  Well, now, when they built the barn the first time it burned down, they  went up somewhere around Cherokee. That   s where my Grandma Ryel   s  sister lived, and they farmed up there around Cherokee. There was some  buildings up there that somebody had left, the farm or whatever, and  they actually disassembled the barn up there and brought it down here  and re-erected the barn. That   s where that one came, the one that burnt  down when we were here. I don   t know what the one looked like when it  burned the first time.  Didn   t your grandpa have, like, a saw mill or something? We have that  big saw blade.  Well, other than just to cut.  Just a big saw to cut, make their own lumber.  Just to cut on lumber and a few things. There wasn   t enough trees  around here to do that, much of it.  So from the rental house, then y   all moved here? Or, no, you built a  1 5  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  house, your parents.  My parents built a house a mile and a half south of here. Used all of the  wood out of the school that him and Mom went to school in. They tore it  down. It was called the Round Grove Schoolhouse. They tore it down  and built their house down there. My mother had one sister, and she  married a gentleman that was a carpenter by trade. He farmed, also, but  he was a carpenter by trade. Him and my dad built that house down  there.  Is it still standing?  Yes, it is.  It   s not in real good shape, but it   s still standing. It   s been empty a long  time.  And what was going on in the house that was on this property. Your  grandparents still lived here.  Well, I don   t remember the date that they actually   my grandpa passed  away at about seventy. My grandmother was, what, probably about  eighty-eight, something like that. She was in the home in Carmen when  she passed away. My grandpa passed away here. Then she lived here I  think about a year and then moved to the old folks home. Right then was  about the time my dad purchased this farm from them and his siblings.  Then he sold the house, and it is sitting in Cleo Springs, Oklahoma.  Moved it from here?  Yes, from here, which they   ve remodeled and done some things to it  down there. It is actually sitting in Cleo Springs.  Well, you always said   he didn   t think Ray or his brothers would ever  get married. Then we got married a couple years later, wasn   t it?  Yeah, something like that, but that house, it needed a lot of work. When  we moved up here, we moved a     Single wide        single wide        ten-by-fifty trailer        ten-by-fifty trailer house up here.  1 6  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel     that his maternal grandmother had lived in until she     It was probably the hottest summer that ever happened around here, and  we didn   t have air conditioning. We had a water cooler in the living  room, and that   s where we slept because it was so hot. Then we  eventually had this.  It was funny because the other day he got a social security statement,  and it was like in   80-something when we had three kids. Our annual  income was, like,  8,500 annual income. I stayed home and helped farm  and, you know, didn   t work. We made that decision to be a full-time  mom, and so we canned, and we did everything.  Well, my mother did, too. She canned everything.  Well, she taught me everything.  Large garden, then?  Yes.  Always.  Would you have to help with that?  Oh, yeah. We raised tomatoes and potatoes and onions, carrots, turnips.  Trying to think   . Until I got married to Joyce, I didn   t know what okra  was.  And I didn   t grow any turnips because I knew what they were.  (Laughter)  I like raw turnips, but I don   t like them cooked.  So you had to learn how to hoe pretty early.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes, that and pull weeds and keep the chickens out.  Well, when it was time to slaughter the chickens, who would do that?  We did.  But who   s    we   ? The kids or your mother?  My brothers and mother and father. We were the chicken butchers. We  1 7  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  would kill the chickens and heat the water up and scald them so that you  could pull the feathers off. My mom would put them in a cool tank of  water, and she   d sit there and clean them. Our job was to cut them up.  He taught me how to cut up a chicken. (Laughs) I was a city girl.  In fact, we used to butcher about 250 chickens a year when Joyce and I  got married     When the kids were little, yeah.     when the kids were little.  It was a production, then.  And the kids hated it, oh my gosh, but, you know, it   s the way life was.  If they wanted a new baseball mitt or whatever, you get out there and  you butcher chickens. You did your part. You had to. There wasn   t  anybody else. That was our food.  And then what would you do? Where would you sell them?  We just always had people that were lined up. I could have sold twice as  many as I did.  We   d sell about fifty of them.  And then the rest we   d eat through the year.  We   d give our parents chickens to eat.  Well, your mom and dad always come up and helped.  Yeah, they   d come and help.  They were so close to our kids, especially our youngest. He spent from  the time he could   by the time he was potty trained, he was with  Grandpa every day. Claude would come up here and sit around and talk  a little bit. Then him and Mason would go, and they   d go out and take  care of the cattle. He knows as many of the stories as the rest of us.  That   s part of the problem. Everybody loses the history. That   s why I  was so excited to be able to do this, was to have some of it recorded.  I   ve heard a few things today that I didn   t know.  Was there a particular time of year when the chickens would be     1 8  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J.

Was your mother or grandmother involved with home demonstration  clubs, homemaker clubs?  No, not too much. I don   t know that they had a lot of them back then. Of  course, with us being in 4-H, they were involved in whatever our 4-H  projects were.  They were real involved in the American Legion.  That and the church, the Christian Church in Aline.  American Legion is a kind of Ryel Legion. It was named after the Ryels.  Your dad always loved the parade, and that was a really big, you know,  because he served his country and paid a price for it. That First Christian  Church, we got married in the same church that his parents got married  in, which is   oh, it wasn   t?  Boy, you   re telling fibs now.  I didn   t mean to.  Boy howdy   Oh, I guess I don   t know the story.  We caught you in a lie. (Laughter)  I   m busted.  Who told you that story?  I guess I just made it up. I don   t know. That   s what I always thought.  Are you sure?  They got married in Medicine Lodge. (Laughs)  Oh, that   s right, that   s right. Dang.  Put her on the spot: when?  1 9  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J.

Our daughter got married in the same church we got married in.  There you go. (Laughter)  Okay, I knew there was some continuity there somewhere. That   s right.  They went off to Medicine Lodge, didn   t they?  They really didn   t run off.  They went on a train or something, didn   t they, up there?  They probably went on horseback. (Laughter)  Your dad told me a lot of stories.  A lot of them aren   t true. (Laughter)  He was a mess, oh my gosh.  A lot of them weren   t true, either. I   ll tell you, he could sit there, and  serious. You even knew it wasn   t true, but he could tell a story, and you  would believe everything he said.  Well, and I came in as a very na  ve city girl, and here he   s telling me all  this stuff. Oh my gosh, did they play tricks on me because they didn   t  have any sisters. I was the first girl in the family.  Well, how did you two meet?  It was a accident.  It was. I think I served him a hamburger. I grew up in Laverne,  Oklahoma, and my dad moved to Fairview. There was a little, called  Queen   s Kitchen, a little restaurant, but it had like the Sonic does. It had  the little telephone that you could order. He worked in Fairview at a  manufacturing plant, and he   d come in there during the summer and eat  lunch. I worked there from when I was a senior and then through my  first year of college. He had a really cool car, like a 1970 Dodge Demon.  Did I get that right?  Yeah.  Okay. Give me one. (Laughs) It was almost a short marriage because he  tried to teach me to drive that. It had a clutch in it, but it was like a  2 0  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  competition clutch. I couldn   t even hold it down with two feet, much  less...  You could hold it down, but it was when you went to let it up, that  spring in there would     When I was in high school, I just played basketball and studied and  stuff. We went back for my fifth-year class reunion. I   d gotten married,  and I had three kids, and I was milking goats and butchering chickens.  All my friends were like,    Oh my God, what did you do to her?     (Laughs) But I loved it.  So when did you get married? You graduated from high school in   70,  you said.  Seventy-three.  August 10, 1973.  Did she get that right?  What I have trouble remembering is her birthday. I never can remember  whether it   s the eighth of October or the seventh, so I just buy her two  presents, and that way I   m covered.  Oh, whatever. Some years I get good presents. Some years I get nothing.  You didn   t get anything this year.  One year for my anniversary I got, like, an old watermelon that had been  in the back of the pickup.  I always bought her something, and it was never the same thing.  It was never the same. One year I got five milk goats. That was, I think,  Mother   s Day or something.  Yes, but one thing I have never bought her, (and this is the truth) I   ve  never bought her flowers, ever. Not that she don   t deserve them, it   s just  that I   ve never done anything wrong to ever have to buy flowers.  Whatever. (Laughs)  I don   t think I want to touch that. (Laughter)  I know. I don   t think I   d go there, no, no, no. Forty-one years, we   ve  2 1  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  made it that long.  Well, when the farm came into your ownership, did you start making  changes on some of what was grown?  No.  It   s just what works here. The options are kind of limited.  I have tried soy beans about five years ago, and it actually cost me five  thousand dollars more to grow the soybeans than what I made, so we  didn   t do that. We   ve tried milo a couple of years. Actually, this year  was the first time we ever got a milo crop, and it made forty bushel     Which is real good for him.     which is real good for dry-land milo around here. Our wheat crop this  year was the worst that we have ever harvested in our lives, which  averaged three bushel to the acre of what we farmed.  Just drought, it was just a drought.  This drought just killed us. We do a lot of what people call, I guess,  crabgrass. Most people think that   s a weed, but cattle love it. We have  our own hay business, and we put up a lot of crabgrass hay for our cattle  during the winter. Then we plant feed on a few places that we kind of  want to kill the stickers and the weeds and stuff. We   ll plow that up and  plant feed.  So how many acres are you managing these days?  About twelve hundred. That   s why I say we   re just small. We   re just  small farmers. We own three quarters, but we   re just small farmers.  Was there a point at any time that you thought you would lose this  original sixty?  Yes, in what, 19     Ninety-eight.  In 1998.  Our youngest one had got out of high school, and I stayed at home with  the kids. That was our choice so that they could do the 4-H and the  basketball and stuff like that. The last one had graduated, and it was  2 2  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  so   we couldn   t even have electricity and food in the same week, so I  got a job as a receptionist for a oil field company in Enid.  Well, you drove the school bus part-time     I drove the school bus part-time but got a job over there.     and made ceramics and sold at Christmastime for Christmas money  for the kids. But I think it was 1998, wasn   t it, that, oh man.  Was it weather related?  Oh, yes, that and interest was 22 percent interest.  It was just tough.  It took a pretty good toll on us, but we came through it. Joyce has a very  good job, and if it wasn   t for that, we probably wouldn   t have made it  farming.  What are your thoughts on crop insurance?  Well, it   s good, but yet it   s so expensive that    And after you have, just  like we were in the, was it called the El Ni  o year or whatever, when it   s  dry, the crop base in Alfalfa County is thirty-three bushel to the acre for  wheat. When you have five bad years, it drops a certain percentage  every year. See, our wheat base right now is probably only about twenty,  but you pay the same amount for what it was at thirty-three. If it wasn   t  for crop insurance, it would be really bad this year. We didn   t get a lot  for it, but like I say, with getting a decent milo crop, it kind of evened  out. I have always had crop insurance and will probably always still  have crop insurance because you just never know.  Did your father have it, too?  When my father farmed, you could buy crop insurance through the  federal government at fifty dollars. I believe it was fifty dollars per  quarter. What that would do was guarantee you, maybe, (and I don   t  know for sure) but it would guarantee you, like, about a ten-bushel crop.  They didn   t have the means of buying better fertilizer like OSU. We  don   t buy it from OSU because it   s way too expensive, but we will buy a  small amount and plant something. Then we harvest that, and that   s our  seed wheat for next year.  He put some of the farms in CRP  Conservation Reserve Program ,  didn   t he?  2 3  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Yeah. He had a bad time in, what, about the time we were married,  wasn   t it?  Probably in    70.  In    73 he ended up putting these farms in the CRP Program because he  couldn   t make it. They would guarantee him   he got it signed up for  fifty dollars an acre. Of course, he was getting close to retiring, and back  then, well, they only paid you on your base farm acres. They didn   t pay  you for the full hundred and sixty unless it was all broke out. Of these  two farms, there   s two hundred and seventy acres of farm ground and at  fifty dollars an acre. He also had two oil wells that wasn   t producing  very much. He might   ve got two thousand dollars a year out of each one  of them. That, combined with his CRP payment and his     Disability.     disability payment, he kept the payments made on the farm, and they  made a living.  You didn   t need as much back then. That   s what we were talking the  other day about, when we didn   t have any income when the kids were  little, that we didn   t do without. If you wanted jam, you went and picked  blackberries or wild plums, and you just made do. I don   t think we ever  shorted our kids or did without anything. We made do with just what we  had.  It   s just now that everything is so expensive.  Equipment in particular, yes.  Oh, yeah, there   s a  287,000 tractor sitting out there.  Have you gone no-till yet?  Oh, no, we tried that and went broke. (Laughs)  It didn   t work.  We tried it about four years, and it just did not work for us. Some people  have made it work for them, but around here to control the weeds and  the stickers, you just about have to plow or tear it up good enough that  you can get a decent seed bed.  It   s so sandy. It   s all sand around here.  2 4  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Of course, you also farm it so that you don   t want it to blow. I hate for  my ground to blow. It has happened a few years. We even bought a no-till  drill. We finally got rid of that because it just did not work for us.  Well, this  287,000 tractor, was that hard to swallow to purchase that?  Not for me, it wasn   t, but it was for her. (Laughter)  I   m the one with the steady income. It does help to have a spouse work,  and then at least you know you can pay the electric bill this month. It  hasn   t been the struggle that it was before. I ended up very fortunate, and  this farm is paid off. It   s ours.  The house, the farm, is all paid for.  That was our goal, and then our next goal was to have three farms. We  have three kids, so when we   re done, they   ll each have something that  we can pass on to them. We have our three farms. They   re not all paid  for. The other two aren   t all paid for.  Right now the price of land, it has skyrocketed. When we bought this,  we paid fifteen thousand dollars for it.  For a hundred and sixty acres?  For a hundred and sixty acres.  So why do you think the price of land has gone through the roof?  Because of the oil boom. That, and there are some very big famers. I  don   t want this to sound like I   m talking bad about them. I   m not. They  have the mineral rights on all of their farms because they   re older, and  when you sold a farm back in the   70s, the minerals went with it. Now  you sell a farm, you can keep the minerals. Well, with all the new   is it  called horizontal drilling or whatever? They have hit some very, very  good oil wells around here. Now, we haven   t seen the actual checks, but  you hearsay of, like, a million dollars a month on some elite     Not on our land.  No, not on ours. On elite farms, okay? To keep from paying so much  taxes, you go buy another farm. Well, when you have ten farmers that  are fighting over one farm from   well, we purchased that farm south for  a hundred and ten thousand dollars. It got sold out from under us for  various reasons.  2 5  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  It was out of the family for a few years     It was out of the family for a few years and then        but we got it bought back.     when the guy passed away, his daughters decided they wanted to sell  it. Our goal was to buy it back since it was in the family. We thought we  give a lot for it, but right now a hundred and sixty acres around here  goes for anywhere from four hundred and fifty thousand to six hundred.  Wow.  Well, we   ve seen this great boom, especially in Alfalfa County, with  increased oil and gas production. Has that impacted the land you own  right now?  No, the only minerals we own is on this place here.  Okay.  The others we don   t own the mineral underneath them.  Have they drilled anymore on your land?  No.  They stopped about a mile north.  They stopped about a mile north of here. (Laughter)  How convenient.  I know. I was like     But now I will say (and I don   t know for a fact) two years before they  drilled up north of us up here, our oil checks for a year was about two  thousand dollars. Now, that was a year. Since they drilled them up there,  we have not gotten an oil check.  Very interesting.  So, you know, it   s either done, or the horizontal has taken what ours was  at. I don   t know, but I   m just saying. We have not got an oil check in  two years.  2 6  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Have you noticed a change in the community since this recent boom  again?  Yeah because I don   t know half the people in Aline. I mean, people has  moved away. Most of them that have come back in are just the oil boom.  Chesapeake and SandRidge are big competitors that have brought in, not  necessarily brought in but people have moved in to work for them. I  think they   re good companies. They seem like they take pretty good care  of their employees.  But the businesses in Aline have kind of gone under. Used to have a  grocery store. It doesn   t anymore. It has a post office.  Has a post office and a mechanic shop, and that   s about it. We have a  senior citizen deal and the high school. They just built a new high  school, what, five years ago?  Yes. A lot of the kids, like two of our kids, have left, and most of the  other kids that were our kids    age have gone on somewhere else looking  to make a living. If you don   t farm, you don   t work until the oil came in  and has given more opportunities. It   s still basically just a farming  community, you know.  And it   s hard to get good help because all of the good help has went to  places   and I   m not saying anything bad about them. They went to the  oil field because they   re starting out at twenty-five dollars an hour. Most  people around here, about ten bucks an hour for a farm hand is pretty  good money because you give them a place to live and you feed them,  but it   s tough to get someone to work for you for ten dollars an hour.  I work in the oil field, and that   s my business. In a roundabout way, the  oil field has been very good to us     Oh, no, I just        to allow us to do that.  So do you hire extra help during harvest time?  We finally found a couple of young boys. In fact, we sent them to     they   re younger. We sent them to tractor driving safety school this  year     Through the OSU extension     2 7  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel     the OSU extension deal        along with our granddaughter.     along with our granddaughter. What that does, is the OSU extension  goes through and shows them tractor safety stuff. I don   t know all what  it pertained to because I really didn   t ask them too much, other than they  drive a tractor through a course and then they have to back it through the  course. I guess my granddaughter was about in third place. (Laughs) The  two boys that were helping me was first and second.  They live close to here     They just live a mile and a half away from us        so they help him three days a week.     and they   re homeschooled. They   re just really nice young men that  really want to learn. Their biggest thing is when you say,    Let   s take a  tractor,    they fight to see who gets in it. (Laughter)  Do you trust them with the  287,000 one?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes.  You have to.  You have to.  And your granddaughter, no your daughter     Granddaughter. She helps some.     interested in farming?  Oh, no. She does want to be a veterinarian though.  Her favorite place in the world is the farm. She loves to come out here.  We had a cow that had died here six years ago, (I guess it was about like  that) and we had a bottle calf. Just made her day to get to feed that calf.  Well, to this day, she can walk out into a herd of cows out here and  holler,    Lady,    and that cow will come up to her. She has put a halter on  it. She had dressed her up in a dress. (Laughter) She has taken a blanket  out there, and when she   s laying down, she has laid with the cow.  2 8  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  She   s laid on top of her.  Granddad better take care of that cow, then, huh?  Yeah, that   s not one that   s going to town. (Laughter) It   s going to stay.  But it   s actually turned out to be, probably, the best cow we   ve ever had  on this place.  She says her best friend   s a cow.  Not that she   s so tame, it   s just that she   s always had pretty nice calves,  and it belongs to my granddaughter.  Well, we did give   each of the kids have a cow. Then we sell that calf  every year, and Ray gives that money to the kids. That helps with  Christmas presents just a little bit to kind of keep them tied back to the  farm. We   re just like his family when you were growing up. We   re very,  very close. Our family is like that now. The kids love to come here, to  come to the farm. The little boys came Labor Day. We picked apples off  our tree out here, and we made an apple pie together. They   re two and  four. We did it from start to finish.  Well, Ray did you always expect to be a farmer? When you got out of  high school, did you plan     Oh, I don   t know. It just kind of seemed when Joyce and I got married,  that   s what we wanted to do. I really didn   t have any expectations of  doing that. I   ll tell you, to be truthful, when I graduated high school, I  graduated in May of    70. In July of 1970 is when the lottery draft came  out, and a lot of kids got the student deferment deal where they could go  ahead and finish school. I took my chances, you know, to, I mean, if I   m  going to go, I might as well go. I wasn   t going to enlist, but if my  number come up, I was going to go. Luckily my number was 361, so I  should have never went to college because it became just a big party  deal.  But he worked outside     Oh, yeah, I worked at Waldon Manufacturing for twenty-seven years in  Fairview.     so he   d work, and then we   d farm on weekends or after he got off  work. It was a struggle to keep the farm and stuff.  Then I went to Vo-Tech for mechanics and     2 9  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  A machinist.     yeah, a machinist, and that   s what I did down at Waldon was a  machinist. The last seven years I was there, I was the plant  superintendent.  It also gave him a lot of skills that we   ve used on the farm because he  can make anything.  Yeah, I learned to weld and a lot of stuff down there, and they were very  good people to work for.  Well, I know it   s hard to ask you what a typical day is on a farm today,  but for you today, what   s a typical day like?  I fed the cats. (Laughter)  It   s that time of year.  So if we were in harvest season, what would it be like?  Well, probably to the field about, oh, seven o   clock, I suppose. Grease  up the machines, blow the air filters out, and the radiator, fill them up  with fuel. Depending on how much humidity there was, hopefully get  started cutting about eleven o   clock, and if you can, you go as long as  you can. Of course, the elevators usually close about ten at night, so you  always try to have the last load dumped so that you can keep cutting.  Then, of course, around here when it   s time to harvest, it   s time to cut.  You don   t want to dilly-dally around, and the same way with planting.  When the weather   s right, that   s when you need to plant. Now, this year  we did about half of our ground and waited until we got some more rain  because it just got too dry. That that we actually planted later looks  better than that that we planted early because it came up better. Then  you have cattle; take care of those. Of course, that   s when Joyce and I  kind of go on vacation is after we   re done. I say    vacation,    take off and  go somewhere.  After everything   s planted     After everything   s planted.     because the cattle are   we just wean calves, right?  Yeah, we just weaned calves here about three weeks ago.  3 0  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  There   s not as many cows to take care of, and the crop   s in. It   s kind of a  good time to   . We try to   you know, I always said if you don   t have a  good marriage, you don   t have a good family, and so we   ve always tried  to   not that we   ve always.     When did you say that? (Laughter)  Back when I was getting married in the wrong church. (Laughter)  She may need to get you flowers.  No, not happening, so...  How do you keep up with government programs?  Well, just like this year, they have changed some stuff. They have  seminars. They have seminars that you can go to. This new program     I   m not sure how it   s going to work, but there is one November 25 in  Woods County, and there is one December 11 (I think is what they told  us at the FSA  Farm Service Agency  office) on the eleventh that we  have to decide out of, I think, three different   it   s either a cash thing for  your crop or acres or something. I   m not sure. I   m not sure who puts it  on. I don   t know whether OSU Extension puts it on, or whether it   s an  insurance company or what.  The FSA office is good.  Oh, yeah.  Good relationships with those people.  The girls up there at Alfalfa County keep pretty good tabs on everything.  That   s our home county. We farm in Major County, too, but our home  office is in Alfalfa County, so that   s where all the government money  comes from. That, I think, is now no longer (if I understood it) until you  sign up on this new program. We   ll have to make some kind of a  decision of which way we want to go, and I   m not sure what   s it   s going  to be this year because we haven   t went to that one.  The government programs are set up on your wheat base, on what they  pay. It does help. Like here in the sand country, the wheat base is not as  high as it is in Cherokee because it   s better ground. It   s not as high as it  is in Alva because it   s better ground. It   s the more fortunate, but it   s like  my grandpa always told his brother-in-law who farmed up around  Cherokee. He said,    If I want to get a drink of water, I can just go over  here and get a drink.    Up there, they had to haul water because the water  3 1  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  was so gyppy. You couldn   t drink it.  We have great water. That was something Grandpa put a big value on,  you know, was having the     That kind of got off the government program deal, but, no. I don   t know  yet. It   s a meeting that we   ll have to go and decide what we want to do  for the next five years.  Well, everything   s so complicated, you know. To buy chemical to spray  our land, he   s got a private applicators license, and the government  regulations have changed the way you farm. You have to understand all  these regulations and what   s changing to keep up on it. Even with your  crop insurance and stuff, it changes. You have to depend on the people  that are providing that information for their help.  How do you keep records?  Well    (Laughs)  He has a drawer.     I have a drawer. (Laughter) That   s where everything goes, and  towards the end of the year   in fact, Joyce always helps. I   m not a  computer whiz, but she   ll set stuff up. Then I key everything that we do  into the computer, and makes a printout. That, I guess, is our records.  How did your father do it? Any idea?  My mother did it, actually. Of course, he was with what was called at the  time the Farm ers  Home Administration, which was FmHA or  something like that. They would give him, well, actually they didn   t give  him, but you have a book you have to fill out every month. He found the  calendar that had the little pouches in it for each month, and that   s where  they would put all of their bills and deposits for the month because they  were pretty strict about your bookwork. Now, since we do not have  federal loans, we don   t have to worry about keeping that record other  than for our taxes and our investment purposes.  His dad sold Pioneer Seed for a lot of years     Quite a few years.     and so he had that bookwork to keep up with, as well. That helped  supplement the farm income.  3 2  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  And then your grandfather, how did he do it?  Well, now     Don   t know?     I don   t know. I honestly don   t.  Did he trust the banks?  Yes, I think so. Like right now, you know, you go buy groceries. You  might not like one store, so you go to a different one. That   s kind of like  how the banks are around here now, but with the oil boom happening,  they   re wanting you to come in to see them now. In fact, I received some  letters from Enid banks. When we bought our farm over here, east of  here   we are now with Farm Credit of Western Oklahoma which is in  Alva, Woodward, they have one in Kingfisher. They   re all tied together.  It   s a low-interest loaning institution, and they actually beat the interest  rate of what banks do. When we purchased that farm, that last farm, it  was like a pack of wolves, you know. Here you are buying a farm.    You  want us to loan you the money to do that?       No. Where was you at ten  years ago?    I mean, when we really needed help, no one wanted to help  you, and if they did, the interest rate was so bad that   of course, that   s  decided by the federal government, I think, with the interest rates.  Well, now with the oil checks, a lot of people going in and paying off  their notes     Yeah, they   re paying off their notes.     so it   s hurting these small town banks because     In fact, the reason I know it, well, I don   t know it for a fact. My son  banks in Alva, and, actually, the gentleman that works with him is a  distant cousin. He   s really helped my son get started. They are looking  for people to borrow money because, like I say, the oil boom has hit up  there. People have just walked in and deposited their checks and say,     Here, pay off that loan.    I would like to be able to do that. I know I   ll  never win the lottery.  They just need to come a little further down the road.  I know. Just bring it a little further south. It   d be nice to have an income  like that that would pay things off, but, you know, we   re okay, too.  Yeah, we   re not     3 3  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  We   ve got this land secured. We can live on it until we   re both gone,  and then it won   t matter. It   ll be somebody else   s problem.  The way my dad always told me, he said,    If you want something,  you   ve got to work hard enough to get it.    I think we   ve worked pretty  hard for what we have. You know, never really wanted a lot, other than  just to make sure I keep it because, like I say, in 1998 we thought we  was going to lose everything. It was that close. We finally found   what  was the name of that loaning institution? Litton? Something like that out  of Texas. How we found that, I don   t know, but they loaned us fourteen  thousand dollars. That fourteen thousand dollars kept this farm. Of  course, it wasn   t this. It was this old house sat here. We just remodeled  this. It was an old house that sat here. We made monthly payments to  them for, like, about five, six years. Then Joyce with her job moved up  rather quickly, and we paid them off. Then we never borrowed any  money on it again. This was just, like, a little three-bedroom home here,  and it   s now five bedroom with three baths and     They say when your kids leave, you can downsize. They just come back  and bring more with them. We   ll have them when they come home.  We   ll have them all over the place.  And we   d have probably been better off to have just tore it down and  built a new one. It cost us about that much, I guess, but there wasn   t  anything here we wanted to change. Now, we did change the kitchen  around.  Knocked out a wall.  Knocked out a wall.  But the kids are like,    Mom, you like all this old antique stuff. Why  would you get rid of the house that we grew up in? It   s got all the  memories and stuff.    All those memories from his great-grandparents,  you know, all the way down that we   re passing on to our grandkids, the  stories and stuff, that is lost in so many places now.  In fact, we were really upset. The shop sitting out here   which Joyce  talked about my grandparents building that and then having a dance in it.  Well, it got over the years, wondering,    Well, do we put money into it  and fix it? What do we do?    Finally, after we got our house redone,  what, a couple of years ago, we saved up enough money, and we  decided we wanted to fix that garage. We had the carpenters that done  the house come and look at it, and we told them that we wanted it  original, almost like that, but we wanted the outside to look like the  3 4  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  house, the HardiePlank and the roof and all that to look like the house.  They commenced to tearing off some boards. I think every two-by-four  in it had been spliced two or three times because that   s the way they  built things back then, I guess. If you didn   t have enough money to buy  a board, you scabbed one on. Joyce was   was you in Idaho then or  something?  Yeah.  She called one night, and I told her,    Well, it   s going to cost more to  remodel it, to fix it, than it is to tear it down and start over.    So,  unfortunately, we tore it down.  We kept the cement, and we   ve got the old work bench that was in there  put back in.  We built a lot better, sturdier building, I think. We would   ve never seen  any of the old wood, anyway, that was in it, so we ended up tearing it  down. We just did that, what, here about three months ago.  It   s just now getting done. Keeping what we can and preserving it but  still making it a really nice farm, that   s what your dad would   ve liked,  and your grandparents, as well. We think it   s one of the nicest places  around. Nothing fancy, just good farm folks, you know, just good ol     home.  It   s hard to keep old buildings in shape. You could drive around the  country and see that on these old barns because you could end up putting  tons of money into it and you still have an old barn.  And the windmills, we   ve noticed some of them are in better shape than  others, too, so...  Well, this one here, it   s been a long time since it   s worked. In fact, that  was where the well was drilled, even for the house. It was set up so that  it pumped, and then they had an electric deal in there to suck water out,  too. I don   t remember how it was set up. They always had them in pits,  and, of course, the snakes and everything else get in them. Then when  you have a water leak, you usually have two or three foot of water in  there, and that   s not good either. We did not want to get rid of the  windmill. The head up there on top is a   I forget who made it, but you  can   t buy them anymore. Now, you could buy a new head and stuff to  put up there, but we   re not pumping water out of it. The tail deal still  works to tell you what direction the wind   s coming out of.  And you use it for that?  3 5  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Basically, yeah.  How else do you check your weather?  Watch TV.  Use the Mesonet any?  No, I don   t.  This hard freeze hurt any or had you already     No, we were pretty prepared for this year.  The wheat, it   s just good for the wheat. I mean it   s a normal cycle. Yeah,  it   s not a time when it   ll hurt it.  It   s in the spring after it joints that hurts it. That   s when it hurts it the  worst is in the spring.  Do you have a favorite time on the farm, season-wise or time of day,  either one?  Not really, I don   t think. Maybe dark. (Laughter)  Yeah.  Your tractor doesn   t have headlights?  Yes, it does. (Laughter)  It used to work long past dark.  Yeah, we did. Of course, with bigger and better stuff, it doesn   t take us  as long to put in a day   s work, I guess.  What kind of tractor did your dad have?  We   d started to talk about that. Now, my grandpa had   of course, he did  with the horse and the plow and the whole works with horses. Then he  bought that Twin City Minneapolis-Moline tractor that had the metal  wheels on it. I don   t remember what year it was, but they converted it  over to rubber tires. Then my dad bought a GB M and M tractor which  was on propane, and that   s what him and my grandpa farmed together  with. In about 1954, my dad bought a brand new Massey Ferguson 50. It  3 6  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  was mainly a three-point tractor, and that   s what he helped supplement  in when they got rid of that old Minneapolis-Moline tractor, that Twin  City. He farmed with that until 1967, and in 1967 he bought a brand new  John Deere 4020.  Switched brands.  Switched brands.  We   ve driven green ever since.  It   s been green ever since. In fact, our first tractor we owned was a    63  model 5010.  No cab.  No cab. Well, it had that canopy.  Well, that   s not a cab. That   s a shade.  No air conditioning.  Well, the 4020 didn   t have air conditioning, either. Back then, man, if  you had an air conditioned tractor you was way above everybody else. I  went around the field a lot of times on that M and M GB with the little  four bottom plow.  And what would you be   how would you keep your mind busy during  those laps around?  Sing to yourself.  Sing?  I guess.  We should have him sing for us.  Probably not. Not a good idea. (Laughs)  Actually, I do remember one summer I was plowing up here. I don   t  remember whether I was plowing for my grandpa or for Dad. I don   t  remember for sure. It was towards the evening. It was summertime. It  was towards the evening, and it was an old trip plow. You had to pull the  rope to trip it out of the ground. Dad told me that since it was so late  don   t worry about tripping it and finish up this much of it. I was driving  3 7  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  around the fields, and all of a sudden I come up on this plow sitting over  here in the field. Well, I looked back, and I   d lost my plow. (Laughter) I  had drove all the way around that field.  Didn   t know you were missing a plow.  The hitch had broke. Needless to say, hurry up and get that tractor  around over there so it don   t look like I drove all along. I never thought  about the tracks in the furrow. Dad asked me how many times I went  around the field before I realized I   d lost that. (Laughter)  And then your dad, he was such a   he   s even a worse nut than Ray is.  We were down south when we were doing that waterway, and there was  water down there.  We had just been married about four years?  Yeah, not very long.  We pulled some really bad stunts on her.  Yeah.  But anyway, we were down there working on a waterway, and we got  that 4020 stuck. We went to a neighbor and borrowed his tractor to pull  it out. Well, when the water broke, the platform on that 4020 was  probably about three foot off the ground, but the water was running over  the top of that platform. There was pretty deep holes, and it had dual  wheels. Dad had convinced Joyce that we lost the chain out there,  pulling that tractor out and said     I had shorts on..     said,    You need to walk out there and see if you can pick that chain  up.    Wasn   t that what it was, the chain?  Yes. Oh, yeah.     No, you need to get a little farther north.    So she walked a little farther  north.    Now, come this way.    And, of course, when she did, the hole of  where we had spun for that tractor being stuck was probably about five  foot deep, and pew   I just went plumb under. I come up, I was spitting mad. Golly, I was  mad.  3 8  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  There was steam coming off of that water. (Laughs)  They always said that they could hear his dad laughing all the way up  here to the house because he just thought that was     Seems like that should   ve earned you flowers.  Something should have.  I wasn   t the one that did it   I know. (Laughter) Oh, his dad was a mess.  We   ve sent her after panel stretchers.  There is no such thing as a panel stretcher. I   d run all the way up to the  shop.    I can   t find them,    and run back. They   re just laughing because,  you know, I   m the dumb city girl. Maybe forty-one years has been too  long. (Laughs)  I know where your suitcase is at. Want me to help you pack?  I loved your dad. I loved your mom, but I loved your dad especially. His  mom was just real quiet, always wore dresses, and just took care of her  family and did, you know. His dad, oh my gosh, he was fun. I   d get mad  at him, but he was always laughing and making us laugh, wasn   t he?  What were holidays like, like Thanksgiving and Christmas?  Well, Christmas at my house was rough because I only got one present.  His birthday is Christmas Day.  I always got a better one, but that wasn   t the idea of it.  That one year you were three or four, and you got a drum.  (Laughs) Didn   t take long to break the drum.  He   s running through the house, he   d just opened it. Bing-bing-bing-bing,  fell on it and broke his only toy.  No, we always had at least Thanksgiving and Christmas was big family  get-togethers. Of course, my dad had a big family because it was nine  kid, and they usually all came because of my grandparents.  3 9  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Did they come up here?  Yeah, and my grandma, they never had a lot, but she made sure that  everybody got something. It might have been a pair of socks. Might  have been a bow tie. It might have been a whistle, or she might have  made a crocheted item or something, but every grandchild always got  something. Like I say, it might have been a pair of socks, but we all got  something. The same way at my parents    house. That was one thing they  always done was Christmas. Might have only been one present, like I  say, but     Well, when we moved up here, there were two big trees and there was  a   I don   t remember the hammock, but the chain was in the tree.  It growed in the tree.  That was a good time. You kids always played on the hammock, didn   t  you?  Yes.  That   s what we usually ask that, too: What would you do for fun? Since  you worked so hard, what would you do for fun?  Well, whenever we   d come up here, my grandpa always worked with  wood. He   d always have some pieces of, I   m going to say, one-by-fours,  one-by-threes, lath, or something like that laying around, and we   d make  guns. (Laughs) Or we would take   down when we lived down south  when we were growing up, we   d take old gears and find as many nails or  whatever we could and an old two-by-four, and we   d make our own  tractors and think of being big farmers, I guess, and whatnot. We made a  lot of our own toys to play with when we were little. In the summertime  we had horses, and part of our job was   my dad rented some ground  over east of here. Part of our job was to drive milk cows up for the  pasture and put them in the pasture for that day, that morning, after we  got done milking, and then at every night bring them back around four  o   clock.  That was work. That wasn   t fun.  Well, it was     Oh, you made it fun.  We made it fun, I guess. We   d always do like trail rides. If there was a  mud hole, we   d make them cows walk through it. (Laughs)  4 0  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Imagination, huh? Well, when you got in trouble, who would discipline  you?  Both of them. My dad would whip us with a flyswatter, a wire one, and  whether we need it or not, he   d give us at least five swats.  Probably needed it.  We usually needed it. We usually needed it. You see stuff on TV when  you   re little and you think, especially back then, that could be  believable. My older brother and I, we hung my younger brother,  literally, by the neck     Stood him up on a barrel.     and kicked the barrel out from under him. (Laughter)  He survived. He   s okay.  Yeah, he   s alive. (Laughs) We found an old bicycle. The back end of it  was all messed up, but we built a chariot, and with the horses we fixed a  way up to pull that chariot. We probably had more fun with that thing  because when Dad was out plowing, you leave a plow furrow. I don   t  know whether it was me or my younger brother got the idea, but my  older brother was on it. We got the big idea to cross that plow furrow  pulling that chariot. Well, you can imagine what that done to that  chariot. It stood it up, and he just kept going. Broke the front wheel off  of it, but I guess that was fun. (Laughter)  It   s a wonder any of them survived, I think. Well, when you turned  sixteen, your dad locked you in the stanchions in the milk barn.  Yeah, he locked me in the stanchions. They were homemade wooden  stanchions     Which is where you lock the cows.     put the cows and lock them in there so they   d stay there and eat. Once  in a while to keep the feed from rotting or getting bad, we had a deal  made where you   d dig it around the four-by-fours or the two-by-fours  that came down through it where the cows couldn   t lick it out. Like I  say, my dad, he could sell sand to an Egyptian. That just was his  temperament. He said,    Would you mind cleaning them deals out real  quick before we bring in more cows?       Well, sure.    I grabbed that deal  and got in there. About that time, that stanchion went and locked, and he  4 1  J. Ryel  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  J. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  Finchum  whipped me, not in fun, I don   t think. Lord, it made me so mad. He told  me, he said,    Son, I   ll probably never, ever get to do that again.     (Laughs) I said,    No, you won   t.    That was the last time he ever  whipped me, and he did it in love. He didn   t do it, you know     It was the old times, you know. If your kids needed whooped, you  whooped them. It   s the way we raised ours, and all three of them are  great kids. We never had any trouble out of any of them, not that I knew  of, I guess.  Oh, I   m sure they done plenty of bad stuff. I did things I wasn   t  supposed to.  You   d do almost all of it again.  Yeah, I probably would. I don   t think there   s anything I   d want to  change.  Our final question will be what do you see for the next one hundred  years for the farm?  Probably my youngest son still farming it, and hopefully our grandkids  hanging on to it.  We want it to stay Ryel. If we can leave it where we can get these three  farms paid off, especially this one, then they   ll have a legacy that comes  behind that maybe they won   t struggle like we had to struggle to keep it  and buy it. I don   t know. Our granddaughter, she   s fifteen, the oldest  one, and she swears this is her house. She   s coming back here; this is  where she   s living. I think things change, obviously, but I think they will  all   our daughter   s about an hour away in Woodward, and our oldest  son   s in Arkansas. I don   t know that they   ll ever come back. He would  choose to, but, you know, marriage and stuff makes a difference, and  jobs. I think they all are very grounded in the roots of the farm. This will  always be home to them, and I think it   ll always be home to our  grandkids. There   s not a better place in the world than right here.  I   d say Great-Grandpa Watson would be happy.  Yes. We were having a discussion. I was in Houston last week, and it  was like,    Where would you go on vacation?    I was like,    I   d go to the  farm.    And they   re like,    But you live there.    I said,    But it   s the best  place ever.    This is where I always come back to. He   ll never leave, and  hopefully our kids will be here for another hundred years, plus.  Anything else you want to add before we sign off? No?  4 2  J. Ryel  Finchum  R. Ryel  Finchum  J. Ryel  This has been fun. It   s been good.  Well, we thank you very much for sharing.  Yeah.  It   s been great.  Good.  -------  -------
