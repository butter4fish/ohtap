 Finchum  Today is August 13, 2008. My name is Tanya Finchum. I am with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an Oral  History project called    Centennial Farm Families    and we are here  with Darrell Stiles and Nancy Stiles Chipukites. And we are in Cushing,  Oklahoma on the farm. So thank you for having us today.  Thank You.  And Juliana Nykolaiszyn may chime in with questions once or twice so  we will introduce her as well. Okay, so let   s start by having you tell us a  little bit about how this land came to be in your family.  Well the original homestead was homesteaded in the run of 1889. My  great-grandparents made the run just like everybody else that made the  run. I am not sure whether there was any ahead of the wagon or not but I  remember the story of the wagon when they crossed the creek going to  the squatters    camp. My great-grandmother was bounced out and lost a  child whenever they crossed the creek. I think it was Stillwater Creek.  And that was 1890?     89.  I think it was 1891  Oh, instead of    89?  Yes, Uncle George corrected that here in his book.  Okay and they had come from?  5  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Kansas.  Kansas. And the name of the farm is Cabin Creek is that correct?  Yes, Cabin Creek Farms. That   s been the name since they started, I  guess, because they used to milk cows and peddle milk. I have seen  pictures of a wagon that had Cabin Creek Dairy on it. Cabin Creek  Farms has been that way since, since they settled.  So the creek was probably named that at that time too then?  There were two major creeks in the Sac   Fox territory. It was Big  Creek that is west of here, and then Cabin Creek that the farm sets on.  So they named their farm, when they did start dairying, after the Cabin  Creek.  Okay.  It   s still on some maps. Sometimes you can see a map that will have it  on there. But at one time they had a sign on up 33  Highway 33  but it   s  not there any longer.  Okay, and how much acreage did they begin with?  160 acres.  A quarter.  And how much is left? Is the whole amount still there?  Well that whole place is still there and we own land on three sides of it.  Okay.  Great-grandpa   s brother was also in the run, Steven Stiles. And he got  the quarter section that was immediately east of the original home place.  Okay.  And years later our dad bought that quarter.  Quite a bit of acreage then?  Well, that had to have changed ownership one other time, if that be the  case.  6  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  I think so.  Because when Dad purchased that land, it was what they called the  Thompson estate. And that makes us own a mile frontage on Highway  33 east of, well a little bit east of the old home place, full mile frontage  there. Then Dad and Mother lived on the school quarter just directly  across the Stiles Road west and my sister bought it two or three years  before she passed away. She propositioned the School Land  Commission to sell it and they did, and she got it bought. Then some  time, probably back in the late 1950s, we were able to purchase the  quarter to the north of the original home place which was at that time  owned by Lloyd Yount. So that gave us three quarters in that section that  we owned, and then probably   in the 1960s there was some property  across Grandstaff Road, 292 acres or something that my dad got  purchased from a gentleman named Lloyd Eaton. Lloyd Eaton   s wife  was a Duncan, and her dad built and owned the Duncan Theatre in  Cushing. But at the time Hiram Duncan owned it there was a big lake  and a big board structure out over the water and I heard Granddad say  that people would come from miles and miles around to dance on that  floor out over that lake.  That was the recreational spot.  And then the oil boom hit and at that time they weren   t taking real good  care of the salt water so it ran into the lake and made Hiram Duncan  mad. He blew the dam with dynamite and let all the water in the  Cimarron and he got sued for turning salt water in the Cimarron. So the  property was gully washed real bad. When Dad bought it, we brought in  dozers, sloped the bank and filled it in and did a lot of conservation  practices. So it   s added to the farm.  Sure.  And then Uncle George that Nancy speaks of owned some 80 acres of  property which is a mile west from Stiles Road and then a mile north.  There is an 80 down there that we   ve owned since the beginning,  whenever Uncle George bought it. I don   t know when it was.  Quite a piece of land belongs to the Stiles then huh?  He   s really our great-uncle but he was always just Uncle George.  So the first owner was George, Sr.?  Right.  7  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  And then George, Sr. had four, five kids?  He had six or seven children I believe, I   d have to go back and count.  Uncle George was the oldest.  Of that group?  Yes, he was about 13 years old when they made the run. There was a  squatter   s camp up close to Stillwater and a family by the name of  Mansfield had developed that squatter   s camp for people who were  coming over from Kansas and waiting for the land to be opened. I think  there were four or five families that were there. And then when they  came down that morning in September that they opened up the land  Great-grandpa and his brother Steve, on horseback, crossed the  Cimarron River and the place they really wanted, because they had come  over and looked around and determined what spot was their favorite,  was the one that Lloyd Yount actually staked. He got there first. So  Great-grandpa went a little further south and got the 160 that Darrell is  referring to. But there was someone already there, a Sooner. And it was  in dispute for about seven years before they actually gave the claim,  legitimately, to Great-grandpa. But his neighbors testified that he legally  was the first one there. So at the courthouse in Guthrie they got the  record straight.  Of those five or six children did they all stay on the farm or did they  disperse?  Well, Uncle George, of course, went to OSU and graduated and then he  did doctoral work at Georgetown University?  I believe so, in Washington.  He actually became a medical doctor but he had interest in livestock, too  so he did some early work with antiplasmosis with a Dr. Snow at OSU. I  remember him telling us about collecting horseflies for blood samples in  the large animal building.  He had a serious back problem. He wanted to be a surgeon but his back  wouldn   t allow him to stand so that   s when he decided to become a  veterinarian. So he had two doctorate degrees, actually.  He didn   t live on this land as an adult?  No, he came back to visit and then our grandpa, Lee Ray Stiles, and his  middle name was really Roy but they got it wrong in records. There was  another Roy that was born and I think it was the child right before  8  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  grandpa and he passed away just a day or two after his birth. And he was  buried, there used to be a hedge of cedar trees along Highway 33 on the  home place, and he was buried there. No one has ever really been able to  find the grave but no one really looked for it until the highway was  widened and took out the cedar trees. Then there was a dispute and a  lawsuit with the highway, State Department, Oklahoma Department of  Transportation and Dad over damaging the grave. Unfortunately my  father lost. It was not a happy day. But Grandpa was the only one who  stayed on the farm and quite frankly the rest of the brothers and sisters,  we hardly ever saw or knew. Uncle George came back and he liked to  fish and visit with his little brother and he was the only one we ever  really knew. One of the girls actually married an uncle on my mother   s  side so we have double relatives, double cousins. And it   s been kind of  fun to get acquainted with them. They   ve come around and asked  questions and wanted to see the home place and work on some  genealogy. So it   s been fun, knowing who they were.  Then your grandfather, then your father and then you. Will your  children? Do you anticipate that they will stay on the farm too?  I think Darrell has a grandson who will. He has shown an interest in  farming. He   s going to be a freshman in high school this next year. And  he has told me that he plans to come back and farm so I think it will  continue. All of the land is in a family trust so we think that   s the way  it   s going to be. And the school quarter that my sister bought, it was left  to me and I intend to just deed it back to the farm. My brother doesn   t  know that yet.  We might want to scratch that through when the transcript   s back.  No, that   s alright. He needs to know at some time.  Okay. Well initially what was their income source? Dairy, you had  mentioned earlier.  Initially they did work for other people. They worked for the Indians,  and I thought was kind of interesting.  Doing what?  Clearing land. They would go for as far as Euchee Creek which is east of  Cushing two or three, four miles perhaps. And the Indians were clearing  the land there, the meadows. Uncle George and his dad would go over  there with mules or the team of horses, whatever they had to work with  and cleared the land.  9  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Once they started this as the farm how did they make their living?  They initially grew some castor beans and cotton. Then it was in about  1921, I believe, that they started the dairy. And they milked up until  either the 1950s or the 1960s but they milked for a good long while.  Through the troubled 1920s and the Depression in the 1930s.  In his later years, Grandpa became deputy sheriff in Payne County and  earned, I think it said, a 125 dollars a month or something like that.  Supplemental income?  Yes, and then after he started as deputy sheriff that left Grandma to milk  by herself, and she did. Their milk barn was added to the old original  barn, the first barn on the homestead. She had to carry milk fifty yards,  at least, heavy buckets, up to the milk house where she would strain it  and cool it. So it was not an easy life and it probably attributed to her  early death.  And she had how many children?  She had six.  Six.  Six children  Now what is the source of income?  Well my dad, who was the second oldest child of Lee R. Stiles, Sr.,  worked. He was in the Navy and then he worked for Shell for just a year  or two. He really liked working for himself better than for someone else  so he also became a dairy farmer. He and Mom started dairying in  January of 1946. I remember that real well because that was the year I  was born so they talk about that a lot. So from the time Mom had four  children she milked cows. They were both raised on dairy farms, Mom  milked cows since she was just a small child and, of course, then Dad  grew up on the dairy farm. Then they became dairy farmers, which is  rare. Generally, if you are raised on a dairy farm and work 24/7 you   re  just more than tired of it. But they both ran that dairy and we milked on  the school quarter, what we still call the school quarter until 1970. Then  Darrell moved back and helped and they built a larger barn and dairy  and started milking a hundred head.  New technology, I guess, helped with that too.  10  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Yes.  Of the original buildings on the farmstead, how many are still standing?  Well most of them. The original log house, of course, is not there. Then  a building that we always knew as the carriage house was also a house.  Then the main house that they lived in is still standing. The carriage  house is falling down.  Wagon house.  The wagon house. But the barn that was built, the Oklahoma Historical  Application tells what year those were all built. I can   t remember  exactly, but close to a hundred years ago, over a hundred years ago now,  because I think I did it in 1994 or 1995.  The wagon house served multiple purposes after they quit living in it. It  was changed over to a granary back when they were still farming with  horses and mules. It was converted to a granary and it had a hallway and  you drove the wagons through and scooped the grain on either side. And  then grandpa had built shoots down to some hog pens which were down  below a rock wall. And it had a storage area up in the loft and also there  was a cut out going up into the loft, in the top of the roof for a block and  tackle. That   s where they did all the butchering. They   d butcher calves,  and he had always raised quite a few hogs and they would butcher four  to eight hogs in the fall. You know that   s the old saying,    Turned off  cool, believe I will go home and butcher.    Well, in the fall when it got  cool that   s when they   d butcher. I remember he had a great big  galvanized barrel and he   d build a fire under it and he had a thermometer  in it and when the heat got right that   s when they dunked the hogs up  and down to loosen the hair and then they   d put them out on a trough  and we rubbed the hair off them. Then after they were cut up we got to  put all that brown sugar and salt and stuff on the hams and then did they  put them in a smoke house?  I guess, I think I was too little. I don   t remember.  I   m telling you, that was when ham was good back in those days. It  wasn   t filled with water or anything like that. It was good.  It was really smoked in a true smoke house.  Yes. After that they   d take them down to the cellar and hang them up till  they needed one. It  the cellar  was always relatively cool in the summer  and it worked quite well.  11  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  And did they keep their canned goods in the cellar as well?  Yes.  So they were pretty self sufficient from the farm?  Yes, and it was built right on the west end of the house and it was laid  up in sand rock on the inside and covered with dirt. So it was a sort of a  natural device and you could walk through the back of the house through  kind of a vestibule type thing and then right down into the cellar.  And when Grandma and Grandpa got married and lived in the house,  Great-grandma and grandpa lived in the cellar. They did all of their  cooking. They didn   t cook together. They did their cooking and  everything down in the cellar. It was kind of a unique design and it had  running water down there and they put the milk there to cool, that they  brought in to drink.  Most of the drinking water came from a cistern. The house had eave  troughs that come around to one given point and the water went down  into a cistern that had a layer of charcoal in it. The water all went  through this charcoal and then down into a storage device underground.  And that was probably eight or ten feet from the back door of the house,  one of the back doors. They had two. You could go out to the cistern and  pump up some water.  Where did the two back doors go to?  Well one of them went outside and one of them went to a porch area.  The one on the north went to a porch area where they would come in and  undress or whatever they did back there. The other one went directly out  to the cistern from the kitchen.  Did the materials they used to build the places come from the farm  itself?  Well, originally the log house and those kinds of things, the log cabin  and the cellar but I don   t know.  The other house as I remember them telling, they hauled the lumber  from Guthrie because that was the main source. A lot of them in those  days hauled their lumber in here from Guthrie. Which is about, what?  Forty miles?  Yes. Is it one of those trips that Uncle George met up with the Dalton   s  and gave them a ride?  12  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  I don   t remember that story.  He told about that, but I don   t know if it was hauling the house materials  back or just another trip but he gave them a ride one time in his wagon,  the Dalton brothers.  Were household chores divided between the genders or was it pitch in  and do what needed to be done, whoever happened to be there?  Well I think probably everyone had to help and do their share and, of  course, Uncle George probably got the most of them because he was the  oldest. Grandpa was the baby but he grew into them because as the  others left or got older or got married he was pretty much left there to do  it.  I am sure that   s the way it went because everything went that way in  those days, even when our dad and our aunts and uncles on that side of  the family were growing up, but the other side, too, as far as that   s  concerned. They all worked. They all pulled their share. Because the  boys, I remember when I was just about old enough to remember, like  four, they were still farming with horses and mules. They would start  early in the morning and give the horses a break during the heat of the  day, particularly during the summer time. Put them back in the barn,  feed them, and they would go back out in the evenings when it cooled  off a little bit and farm some more. Then I remember them going to do  that because they had some that acted a little broncy and we actually  went out there with saddle horses. My youngest uncle was only four  months older than I was so we spent lots of time together, lots of time on  horseback. We   d go over there with the saddle horse and put a twitch on  some of them animals so they could get them hooked up to go to work,  especially if they were breaking a new one, that would be the routine.  Twitch to get them hooked up and then they were between older horses  that were broke and had experience so they could control them, most of  the time. Dean had a run away with a harrow one day.(Laughs) So you  know I was young but I could remember a lot of those things even the  old thrashing crews and stuff like that was done by horses.  Did they belong to a ring? A thrashing ring that all the neighbors  around would come do your lot and then you go help them?  Yes. That was alive and well clear up after we had tractors because  whenever they were fading out the horses the first tractor we had was  about in 1946 that my dad actually owned, 1946 or 1947, 1946 I think.  And we pulled the same wagon that we use to pull with horses only we  changed the tongue and made it shorter and put a hitch on it so it would  pull behind the tractor. And we pulled bundle wagons with tractors but  13  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  the thrashing crew would be all the neighbors and the guy that owned  the separator or the thrashing machine. It was called both things, some  of them called it the separator. They would take turns going from farm  to farm and when you went to do the next guy you automatically took  your bundle wagon and your helper and went out and gathered bundles  and hauled them back to the machine.  Did they do this seven days a week or did they take Sunday off?  I imagine they took Sunday off. I don   t remember that part but that was  kind of a sacred deal back in those days. They probably didn   t work too  much on Sunday.  When you had time for fun what would you do?  Well this youngest uncle and I used to spend all our time on horseback,  riding here, riding there. Our first job on the thrashing crew was carrying  water. And they would have those old canvas bags or a gallon jug  wrapped with burlap. You wet your bag and that helped make it cool, we  very seldom had any ice to put in it. But we carried water from one  bundle wagon to the next because you would have at least two guys; one  pitching the bundles up on the wagon and one guy on the wagon  stacking and driving the team to the next, called them shocks. They  shocked all the grain and they put so many bundles up in a teepee shape  and they did that as soon as they got it put in bundles. The teepee shape  would shed more water in case it rained instead of the grain lying on the  ground to rot. That was our first jobs and then, I probably shouldn   t  reveal some of the other things we did.  Oh you   re welcome to. (Laughter)  We   d have to edit those out.  We always rode the horses too hard. We   d come in and they would stick  their head half way down the water tank to get a drink which would  scare some people to death now days because you   d kill one or  something, but we never did. And when we got up to around ten or  twelve, we used to go out where nobody could see us and we   d practice  our Pony Express mount. That got me in big trouble because the Pony  Express mount, you got to get your horse to running and then you  bounce on the ground and up into the saddle. And my dad goes out to  get on the horse and he takes off. And he doesn   t know what   s wrong  with this horse, why he started doing that. So probably somebody  confessed but we got in trouble over that.  We also used to go get green persimmons and play cowboys and Indians  14  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  throwing them at each other. We were told not to do that because we   d  poke out somebody   s eye. That   s what they always said. Sure enough  one night I hit Donnie in the eye and we stayed and stayed and stayed  out in the woods till his eye quit watering. I was scared to death that I  really hurt him but finally it quit watering and we went back up to the  house. I don   t think we got in big trouble over that. We used to have a  lot of mud fights. We had a bunch of big ditches up there that had clay in  them and we   d make mud balls and throw them at each other and do a  lot of stuff like that. We   d swim in those same old dirty holes.  We used to swim in terraces and when I can remember us actually  playing together we had made a covered wagon with our pull wagon and  the dogs were hooked up to pull it. We had several dogs, and the dogs  ran away and got in the terrace and Mom had just changed our cloths  and gone to the Laundromat. She had to take the laundry into town  because she didn   t have a washer at home. And we all got in big trouble,  all four of us   because we had gotten muddy, gotten our clean cloths all  muddy. We had to get the dog out of terrace, we told her. They went in  there and just stayed. We used to play softball. They wouldn   t let me  play because they said I was too little so I always got to run after the  ball. And that was in the back lot on Grandpa   s farm.  We   d play field hockey every morning before we caught the bus, too.  We had an old tin can if you hit it with a club sooner or later it would  wind up in a little old ball. We had clubs up there. We   d play hockey  with that can ball before we caught the bus.  And what were winters like?  Seemed like they were worse than they are these days.  Seemed like we were always cold.  We had, in the late 1940s, a huge snow and these same big old ditches  that we played in were just absolutely blown full of snow. I mean, you   d  try and drive cows in or something across them and you   d go clear down  to your waist in those ditches.  Jump off into there and lose yourself.  And then when my folks, our folks, first started milking, what happened  when we had to drive the cows down to Grandpa   s and used his barn?  I don   t remember.  But I remember it was cold, cold, cold. And we had another time when  15  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  we had a big old ice storm on top of the snow and you couldn   t walk  anywhere. We wound up tying burlap sacks on our feet so that we could  get a little traction to get around. Everything broke down when it was  cold, just about like it does now. You get the most miserable day and  that   s when everything breaks down.  What was Christmas holiday like? Did you do anything special for that?  Our tradition back in those days we   d always go to Grandpa   s on  Christmas Eve and then back over to our house and that   s when Santa  Claus had already been there, after we had been to Grandpa   s. And after  we quit doing that we had basically the same thing and have for years  and years and years at our folks    house. Somewhere back years ago the  tradition got to be that we   d have calf fries because we had worked all  the calves back in October, probably. So then we had calf fries and a lot  of times Janice would come back home, the sister we lost, and she   d be  the chief cook.  So the favorite room in the house was probably the kitchen?  Probably.  Well you know, at times. I don   t think we ever went hungry. We didn   t  eat lavish food. It was mostly potatoes and gravy and chicken and beef.  But, in those days you made a happy plate before you got up and left.  That would cause some turmoil once in a while.  You had to clean your plate, in other words?  That   s right. You better learn how much you can consume because you  were fixing to stay there till you ate it, I   m telling you.  I thought it was interesting, Bob said that probably the kitchen was the  favorite room in the house and I remember that is where we took our  baths on Saturday nights. We...  No, we did it out on the porch after you were born.  Well, Yeah, Okay. I remember taking a bath in the kitchen, when did we  ever do that? Mom would bring that wash tub, that oval shaped wash  tub.  Yeah, big giant thing.  I always got to be the first. I was probably the dirtiest. But I got to be the  first, and we all bathed in the same water there in the kitchen in that oval  16  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  tub, that tin tub.  Just kept adding a little hot water.  How often   ?  Oh, once a week. Saturday night  Saturday night.  And were there creeks around where you could take a dip, if you needed  to, in between?  In the summer, probably.  Yeah we did that.  We   d go to the terrace or     That terrace was so muddy it would make you dirty, I   m telling you. It  was bad.  To the pond.  Is the terrace where you grew something normally?  No, we   re not talking about a terrace out at your house. We   re talking  about an earthen device that   s built to divert water, or hold water, or to  turn water.  For conservation.  For conservation purposes. In those big gullies that we had when they  built those terraces we had a lot of little bitty ponds when the terrace was  built that dammed up the water in those big gullies and that   s where we  were sneaking off to go swimming.  And she had to go into town to do her laundry?  Yes. We did not have running water at our house until sometime in the  late 1940s or 1950s. But we couldn   t use it for house purposes   kitchen  a little bit, bathroom- no, laundry- no, because it was needed for the  dairy operation. We had to save it for that, and it was a well so we  wanted to be sure that it produced enough water to operate the dairy.  You know at that time we only had a 30 or 40 gallon tank down there  17  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  with the jet pump down in the well. Later on we put in a huge storage  tank and the jet pumped plenty. The water level would get up so high,  the pump would get going and pump it into the storage tank. So most of  the time we had plenty of water if you were careful. Then we got to have  running water. Most of the time it worked out fine.  And what about ice then? Did you have ice plants that you   d get ice  blocks?  There was an ice plant in Cushing that you could get block ice and we  would do that once in a while.  Our grandmother on the other side lived in town and they actually  delivered to her house. The ice man would come to her house. That   s  how they cooled food was with those old ice boxes. You would put big  blocks of ice in the boxes and they had some insulation in them. They  were made out of wood and had doors and you   d put a big block of ice  in there and then that   s where you started keeping your perishable items  was in those old ice boxes.  How was the farm house heated? Fireplace or   ?  Woodstove.  Woodstove. They had a woodstove in the main part and Great-grandma  and Grandpa, in the cellar, had a woodstove. They had a fireplace built  in, actually, down in the cellar.  And how many bedrooms?  Three up stairs and one downstairs, I believe. They had four.  Yeah, because later on Mary was on the north, Donnie was on the west  and Great-grandma lived to be ninety-nine. She lived in the southeast  bedroom. I remember they used to have a stovepipe, had an opening, I  guess it was a stove pipe at one time. But anyway, there was an opening  about yea big around from her bedroom to the front room of the house.  That   s how she got her heat, I guess, was up through that hole.  So four generations under one roof for a while then? If you had Great-grandma     At least three.  Three.  18  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  She was blind in her later years, but she would still sit on the swing on  the front porch and someone would go and get the garden produce and  peas, particularly, and green beans. She would sit in the swing and snap  beans and she, with her fingers, could feel if there were any worm holes  or when she had peas to shell, break the ends off, so she could open  those up and get the peas out. And Mom still talks about her sitting there  and the things she would sing. And we have a record of her somewhere  with some of her old songs.  Oh that would be neat to hear.  So yeah, we need to pull that out some time and be sure that we save  that.  She had a famous quote.  Oh, (Laughs) I think I know what you are going to do.  Should we tell them the famous quote?  Oh, might as well.  She always told us boys,    Wherever you be, let your winds go free. It  was holding one that ruined me.    (Laughter)  And she believed in doing just that. Mom has told me that story.  She was quite a lady.  She was, She was.  That child that she lost when they crossed the creek, was buried up there  at the home place. There used to be a long cedar hedge that was   .  I think that   s Roy. I think that was the other one. Frank, I think, is the  one she lost.  I don   t know which one she lost.  She lost two.  Anyway she lost one crossing when they were moving to their new  homestead. And so they buried him up in that hedge. It was close to 100  yards long, and when they re-did  Highway  33 a few years ago, ten  years ago or something?  19  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  At least.     why, they took them. All that hedge out, had to take it out to widen  the right of way. So, that   s just a little more history, but they had it  marked with the rock. When Donnie and I was little we knew where it  was. We   d go to it and find the rock every so often to see if it was still  there and still in place. Next question.  You don   t want to tell them the rest of the story?  No, I   ll get angry.  Did the women quilt?  I   m sure they probably did     They did, they did later on for sure. Our grandmother on the other side  was a huge quilter.  Huh? I remember mom   s mother quilting, but I don   t remember the  Stiles women quilting.  The other side used to have regular quilting meetings and go to the  church and quilt on a certain day.  Great-grandma, Alice Stiles, started the first Sunday school. She was  very interested in music and she got the music program going in the  church. When they first came here they started and attended the Big  Creek Church of the Brethren. Then later, for some reason, they went to  the First Christian Church. But we   ve never heard the story of why they  switched. It could have something to do with their different beliefs about  Sunday school. The Brethren Church believed in Sunday school and the  Church of the Brethren didn   t think we needed Sunday school. And  since Grandma Stiles was so interested in Sunday school that may have  caused her to split and go to the Christian Church. But that   s just my  thought on it.  But then later on the Church of the Brethren started doing Sunday  school, too.  Oh yeah, they   ve always thought it was important.  Talk a little bit about your schooling then, your early years of  elementary school. How far did you have to go? Walk up hill,  downhill   ?  20  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Well Darrell started and Janice   went to one year at Cotton Wood?  She didn   t.  She never did go to Cotton Wood? Cotton Wood was a one room school  house.  By that time, it had been 1945, and I got to go start school when I was  five. We had moved, maybe Nancy told you this when I was on the  phone, we had moved from the top of the hill west of the place after Dad  came back from the service. He bought an old house over here a mile  west of the old Mandeville place and moved it to this school quarter that  he had leased. Did a little bit of fixing up and we lived in that after we  moved from the top of the hill. And the house on the top of the hill we  moved down to that place and used it for a hay barn. And built a shed on  it and used it for hay storage and mostly a bull shed. Our show calves,  we would fit them over there. Of course it   s deteriorated over the years.  Chip and Nancy burned the leftovers a few weeks ago.  But there was a one room schoolhouse over here called Cotton Wood  which is, oh, a mile and a half, the way the crow flies, or probably two  miles, from where we lived. And the first teacher was a local lady by the  name of Leva Lu Grant. She lived in Cushing and had an automobile  and she stopped at our house on her way to Cotton Wood from Cushing  and picked me up and took me to school. And I had different avenues of  getting home. I don   t even remember for sure how I got home most of  the time. But I do know that most of the neighbor kids over there walked  because a lot of times after school we would walk to their house.  Holderread   s and the Tucker   s were right down the road from the  school, in fact it was built on the Tucker place and Leva Lu Grant was a  sister to Glen Tucker who lived on that quarter. Same quarter that the  school was.  But we had all eight grades there. All the Holderread kids and the  Tucker kids and some others that I don   t remember, the Ivy   s. There was  a boy there named Sonny Ivy. Then after that one year they voted to  consolidate with Hillside. Hillside was an elementary school over here  on North kings Highway which from our house was two or three miles  the other way.  Three and a half.  Three and a half and we started riding the school bus. I finished there  and went through the eighth grade. Then all the rest of them went there,  too.  21  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  And I was the last one of our family to graduate from the eighth grade at  Hillside. None of us through those eight years had missed a day of  school. So they gave Mom and Dad a plaque for the family having  perfect attendance. Five thousand and some odd days which is, you  know, pretty unheard of.  Didn   t get sick very often then did you?  We would manage to get sick on a Friday afternoon, or sometime of that  day that we still got to count it as a full day of school. Then we were  ready to go either the next morning or by Monday morning. So we never  got counted absent.  So in school were you in 4-H or FFA or both?  4-H in grade school. Then in those days they weren   t allowing girls in  FFA yet, so Nancy  and Janice  went through all the way in 4-H. Shorty  and I when we left grade school, we went to Cushing High School then  we got into FFA. I wanted to play football, and do sports even though I  was so little, but Dad kind of said,    You decide one or the other, either  your FFA stuff or sports. I really don   t think he would have ever let me  play sports anyways. But then when Shorty came along he got to  wrestle. He  Dad  had wrestled in high school and was quite good.  Dad was.  But they quit the wrestling program for a good many years and then they  started again when Shorty was a freshmen or sophomore in high school.  So then he got to wrestle but I didn   t do any sports in high school, just  FFA stuff.  It was real difficult for us to participate even though we were two miles  out of town. But we didn   t have our own car and you always had  practice after school. It wasn   t during school time. And we rode the bus  so we had to catch the bus to get back home or we didn   t have a way to  get back home. Because of the dairy, Mom and Dad couldn   t just drop  everything and come and get us. We didn   t have a car and it was  counting on a neighbor or someone to bring us. It just wasn   t feasible for  us to participate.  When dad wrestled they were still riding horses to school and I  remember Dean drove a tractor to school part of the time. We didn   t  have those luxuries.  What was your specialty in 4-H?  22  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  We always had dairy cattle and showed dairy heifers and then in FFA I  guess, especially for me, was dairy judging because we won the state  contest my senior year and we won a trip to Waterloo, Iowa. And that  was a fantastic trip because in those days all the cattle from all over the  United States, all the good ones, came to Waterloo, Iowa. They shipped  them on box cars. And they came to Waterloo, Iowa and that   s where  they had the national dairy show. Then I made the college judging team  and we went back to Waterloo, Iowa and went to the Hutchison contest  and at that time you could do three. So over a year later I tried out again  and made it. We went to a contest in Chicago, so that was probably my  claim to fame.  You mention college I am assuming OSU? OAMC?  No, it changed my freshmen year?  Somewhere about then, I guess  1958? Isn   t that the year we changed it?  Yes, that sounds about right.  I remember reading in the O   Colly about all the hoopla about changing  the name to Oklahoma State University so I think it was my freshman  year.  And you were on the judging team?  No, I didn   t make it till my sophomore year. Then I was on it my  sophomore year or maybe my Junior year. And then I think I skipped a  year. I had to go an extra semester, so I think we went to a fall contest.  Something like that. But they had all kinds of articles and contests about  writing the alma mater. They wanted to do that. I can   t remember that  guy   s name but I remember them talking about that in the O   Colly and  what they were going to do. That   s when they wrote the new alma mater.  Since we   re talking about OSU, do you want to do a rundown of how  many different members of the family have graduated or attended there?  Well our great-uncle George was the first, one of the first graduates. The  first year they had graduates I think there was a class of six. Our great-uncle  George   s boys  Bill and Merritt  went to OSU. Our grandpa did  not go to OSU but our father did. Uncle George, Grandpa   s brother, our  dad, us.  Well our uncle Bob went but lacked a few hours to graduate. Then  23  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Mary, our aunt.  Yes.  And Don, our young uncle. They had a several year lapse then they had  two more children, because the youngest boy was only four months  older than I was.  It was called the second family. I don   t know if they still refer to that  with ones born in later years or not.  There were six of them. Three boys and one girl went to Oklahoma  A M/OSU. The oldest girl did not go but she had two children that  graduated from OSU. Then as Nancy said, it started.  Uncle George, Dad, all of us, all four of us, your three girls, and now the  granddaughter is going to OSU. And I have a son who attended there for  a while but he ended up graduating in Texas, a stepson.  When the early ones went how did they pay to go? I mean, how did they  pay tuition?  They worked. Dad worked at the sheep barn and I   m not sure about  Uncle George how he paid for his education. I am sure he worked at  something. His father gave him the proceeds of a sod crop of cotton.  Then he worked as a janitor and did chores on the college farm at ten  cents per hour.  Did they live there?  Yes. Of course transportation was strictly horseback for the most part  until Dad went. He didn   t have a vehicle to drive. I think Nancy said he  hitchhiked back and forth to school then stayed over there, and probably  come home on the weekends. I don   t even know about that. We weren   t  on tape when we told them about how they survived food wise were we?  No, so you can say again if you wish.  They would be resourceful enough to go into the milk barn and either  take milk out of the tank or out of the can that it was stored in or even in  some cases go milk the cows. He and Dr. Walters, who is a former meat  scientist at OSU, lived together. I have heard them both tell that they had  a lot of milk and crackers so that   s what they ate. I don   t have any idea  what they got paid. I know it wasn   t very much because when I worked  for OSU, in the late 1950s, 1959 probably 1960, the going wage was .75  cents an hour. So you can probably assume a lot less than that. I  24  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  imagine they probably didn   t even pay them. They probably let them  stay in those barns. My guess is they probably didn   t even get paid and  just had their rooms in the barn but I don   t know for sure how that all  worked.  May have had chores to do in exchange for getting to stay there?  Right, yeah they had to feed and take care of the animals and help show.  Alex McKenzie was a shepherd then, a very famous shepherd all over  the United States and judged a lot of shows. He came over from  Scotland?  Yes. I think so.  But anyway, the students that stayed there helped care for the sheep and  even got to go on trips sometimes to show the sheep. They   d ship  everything on box cars in those days. They   d go to places like Chicago  and exhibit. I don   t know whether they ever went to Kansas City or not  but I remember them talking about the International in Chicago. But  they took steers and sheep and maybe even hogs but they went in box  cars.  And I think back then Dad did a lot of work with the sheep. He was  excellent at blocking up the lamb for showing. Back then you didn   t cut  all their wool off. You didn   t sheer them to show them. You left the  wool on and you carted it, and clipped it with hand clippers, and it was  quite a masterful operation. They looked very nice. They were very  square. Shorty and I showed, Glen  nicknamed Shorty  our brother,  showed sheep in 4-H and FFA.  I did too.  Did you?  Yes.  He developed that skill, also, of blocking a sheep. Now they just take the  sheers to them and the less wool they have on them the better they like  it. But back then it was a different story.  Did you go to county fairs?  Oh, yes.  And show?  25  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Yes.  Well in the early days we had a district fair here in Cushing. We   d go to  the district fair first then we   d go to the county fair in Stillwater. We had  an old, first vehicle I can remember hauling them in was a 1947 Ford  truck. Stock racks of course. Stock trailers hadn   t even been invented or  thought of then. If you had a vehicle why it was some kind of an old  truck with a set of stock racks on it. That   s the way we hauled  everything and we   d make two or three or four trips trying to get our  animals over there. Then before I got out I had hogs too and showed  sheep and hogs and dairy cattle. So it was an event for us. The old  saying was,    It always rained at fair time.    The fairgrounds in Stillwater  were down there west of where Couch Park is now. There used to be a  naval thing right west of there, and then it started the fairgrounds and  they had the hog barn. The sheep barn was, at that time, in the north side  of an old pavilion there.  Where they had the horse pulling contest.  The old pavilion was dirty and they always had a horse pulling contest  and it was in there. It would get so dirty and foggy and dusty in there  that you could hardly sit in the stands and see the horses pulling the dirt  was so bad. Then they built some buildings a little farther to the east and  they also had a horse barn and a race track. They kept horses there year  round and had a race track there. That was right north of where the high  school high school football stadium was. All of the fairgrounds were  west of there, the buildings and stuff.  One time we were going to the fair, before they re-did  Highway  177  from the hill out south, they raised that a great deal, the highway level.  But we got into town, the old truck flooded out and the water was  coming, running in the doors into the floorboard. That   s how deep the  water was, trying to get through that low part. Right in there where  Kern   s is now, their processing plant, there was a road in there, and then  you turned and went up over the railroad tracks. We used to stay, the  boys did at least. I don   t know whether the girls did or not.  No. Mom and Dad wouldn   t let us stay. That wasn   t the proper thing to  do.  We   d always go with the animals, take our bedding and stay. Dad had  me get out to do something, I don   t know what it was, in all that water.  All the bedding fell out because you had it all piled up at the front of the  truck, it fell out in the water. But anyways those were good days. Boy,  you could have fun all night long. (Laughter) Till they drove around to  see if you were going to bed or not and caught you leaving the area and  26  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  then you were in trouble.  And how long would that last? About a week or just a few days?  Four or five days, wasn   t it?  Yes. It was close to a week in those days.  And you were out of school and of course some of the teachers didn   t  like that and some of them were okay with it because if you were a good  student you would make up your work. But by the time you went to the  district fair, our local fair in Cushing, the Payne County fair at  Stillwater, and then there was always a state show or two that you would  go to if you had good animals. So you might be out of school for a  month.  Right at it...  With your 4-H and FFA projects.  Later on we   d go to Sooner State.  Yes.  At Enid. It was always held in Enid before they started having it in  Stillwater.  That was usually in late summer.  Yes. And it probably wouldn   t take you out of school any but then, like  she said, when you started the other deal, if you went to Oklahoma City  and Tulsa both. The first weekend of October finishes Tulsa, 5th, 6th, 7th,  something like that, of October. So if you went to these local shows and  went to those two you   d easily miss three to four weeks of school. They,  like she said, they didn   t worry about it as much. There weren   t laws like  there is now, no it was just you and your individual teachers and their  attitudes towards it. But now they   ve got them locked down to where  kids can only miss so many days. They probably don   t learn near as  much as we did    (Laughter)     because they had to go to school.  Real life lessons.  Right.  27  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Speaking of 4-H, we all had a leader by the name of Mrs. Neoma  Bateson. She and her husband taught at Hillside. He was the seventh and  eighth grade teacher, worked with the boys    basketball teams. She taught  the third and fourth grades and worked with all of us enrolled in 4-H and  taught girls basketball. And she helped us with our demonstration  speeches and everything. To my knowledge she is living and she is in  Sapulpa, I think, in a nursing home. We   ve tried to find her but we  haven   t had any luck the last few months. But she worked with each one  of us four kids and was truly a family friend and probably helped us all  far more than we   ll ever realize.  Well, he did too. He was always helping Donnie and I. We had a  demonstration, a soil conservation demonstration, that we won state with  and he helped us a lot with it. They even built our containers and stuff  down there in the school shop. It was different in those days. Of course  we had Sunnyside, Hillside, Harmony, Happy Valley, Deep Rock, and  maybe Old Grove. Those five schools were right here close together in  this community and the surrounding areas of Cushing High School and  they all had 4-H programs. Back in those days the principal and or  somebody else in there was genuinely involved with the 4-H program  and made them really strong. Harmony principal   s name was Vaught,  Coleman Vaught. He always had a deluxe poultry judging team. Deep  Rock was Lowell Barto but they all supported the 4-H program. So, it   s  quite different today. Some of them don   t even allow it in the school,  don   t offer it, or don   t encourage it.  If you have a mother or father that is interested or someone else in the  community who had a good experience with it that is, now, who you see  as the leader and not someone directly involved in the school as a part of  the administration.  We had the 4-H meetings at the school and the county extension people  would come once a month to the 4-H meetings and offer a program or  some learning thing. Those were held in the school, at least in our  school.  Did you attend the 4-H roundups at OSU?  Yes. Donnie and I went with that demonstration one year. We stayed  over on the east side of campus in an old dorm then. You know those big  flowers that would grow on probably a tulip tree. Do they have a tulip  tree?  They have magnolias.  Magnolias, anyway, they had great big old bulbs on them. We picked  28  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  one for football. (Laughs)  They   re pretty hard, too.  We got caught. One of the security people just really gave us a big butt  chewing for pulling that flower off of that tree. And there were hundreds  on there, hell, I didn   t see that he needed them all but anyway we got in  trouble. But that was a good experience. They had another program  where certain individuals would be selected and you get to go to, in  those days, to Oklahoma City to the stock show. And I got selected for  that one once when I was just really young, me and Owen Lee Walker,  who lives down South of Stillwater. We got to go to that and we were  just really young.  They used to have fair schools. Was that going to the fair school?  Yes. That   s what it was.  Yes, if you rated high enough with your projects or some other  leadership achievement you got to go to fair school and they would have  judging events; kind of self improvement things at the fair schools,  improve our techniques of judging and whatever else you could think of  that would help your 4-H career, I guess. But it was fun because you got  to venture out away from home a little further and that was nice.  That was before they started having it at the fairgrounds, too. They had  some big brick buildings down at the stock yards.  Oh, really? I didn   t go there. I always stayed on the fairgrounds.  When we went, they were still having it down on the stockyards and  they had some big brick buildings down there. I think they were east of  the present exchange building, where all the commission firms were. So  we got the run of the whole deal. You could walk over to the stockyards  where they had all the cattle penned. You could go into the old  commission firm building. I think they   ve changed it all, obviously, by  now, and then back over there they had a dormitory that we stayed in  and, of course, in those days they all had dormitories. The Tulsa State  fairgrounds had a dormitory, too, clear up to, later 1960s because I  stayed in it when I was in college. I got selected to go over there and be  an assistant superintendent and they still had the dormitory then. I don   t  know when they got rid of that dormitory.  And if you did well enough with your 4-H projects you could win trips  to Chicago or Washington, D.C. In those days we would go by train to  Chicago around Thanksgiving and that was always fun. I don   t know if  29  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Darrell ever got to do that or not.  Nope, wasn   t good enough I guess. (Laughs) I am not sure they did it  back when I was in school.  They may not have started it until I was in there. But as a junior or  senior, at least, I got to go to Chicago. That was an exciting trip.  Without parents?  Yes. There would be three or four thousand kids from all over the  United States and it was quite an experience. When you   ve been on the  farm most of the time, not out too far away from your roots that was  pretty exciting.  What she is trying to say is it took you a while to learn how to act when  you got home. I had a little problem with that once and awhile myself.  (Laughs)  Elaborate if you wish.  Well, you definitely try a few things you didn   t try close to home. I   m  telling you that for sure.  Oh, no. I didn   t.  I would think in this community everybody knew everybody else so any  news would get back home before you did.  You had several eyes watching.  You better not get a spanking at school either because, I guarantee you,  it was pretty tough duty when you got home because you   re probably  going to get another one.  Voice of experience?  Yes, well no. I never did get a spanking in grade school, I don   t think. I  didn   t get mine till I got in high school. But that was the rumor floating  around at school. If you got one at school you were told you were going  to get another one when you got home. There was ultimate respect for  your teachers, no back talk, no sassing. It just makes me sick some of the  things I hear today about kids sassing their teachers. And the teachers  were always right. Parents didn   t go up there and raise cain and,    Johnny  didn   t do this or that. That didn   t happen. It was ultimate respect for the  teachers.  30  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  Finchum  Chipukites  The parents defended and supported everything that the teachers said  and did. A lot different than what I hear today.  Is the Cotton Wood building still standing?  No.  No.  I have no idea where it is.  No and the last thing left was the bell but it   s still in the neighborhood.  It   s over on the Tucker place, isn   t it?  It may be. I think it is in front.  They don   t own it anymore but I think it   s out there in the front yard, at  the first house west of the old schoolhouse.  Back in older days, how did you delineate where your property lines  were?  We had fences since we   ve grown up.  Yes. They were good fences. Some of the fences that are still on the  place were probably built when they homesteaded. I   ve heard Dad say  that they were some of the first fences.  Some of them look like it, too.  Don   t guess you ride the fences anymore?  Well we do, on the four wheelers. (Laughs)  Okay.  But we have electric in so many places now. Well, in some places it just  hasn   t been taken care of over the years. It   s been so hard to, you know,  get it sprayed and taken care of. There are cedar trees and trees and all  kinds of things. We are beginning to get more of it cleaned up but just to  make a path, sometimes, will take us a day or two, to go down the fence.  But we are trying to get electric on most of it.  Do you have hired help? Or is it just a family affair?  It   s mostly us, and a grandchild or two who we can talk into coming and  31  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  helping us.  Has it been that way mostly over the years, too?  They had a hired man a lot back in the old days, not necessarily full  time. We had a Native American guy that was pretty much full time and  then Granddad always had   Granddad was a deputy sheriff for years, 16  years?  Twenty-two, I think, or something like that.  But he always knew people and knew somebody that needed work or  something. So a lot of times he   d have some hired help because he was  off being a deputy. At least all the time when I was young he was a  deputy so they had a hired man. This Native American guy actually  lived out at the place. Then he lived a little bit with us, didn   t he, in the  backroom?  Umm-hmm.  He started working for us some in the early days.  There was also an African American family. They lived, I believe, in a  log cabin and they helped with some of the farm operation.  Yes. That had to have been James Simmons. He lived out north of  Cushing and I   m not sure if he didn   t live in a log house. I don   t  remember. But he was a really, really good worker. He built a lot of  fence, helped build a lot of fence. Then Dad had another guy that spent a  lot of time helping us with building fence that lived north of Cushing,  too.  There used to be a cave on the old home place and there was a man who  lived in it for a while. I think he helped Great-grandpa some when they  first homesteaded.  Probably, that was before our time. When we were little and putting  up   we were still putting up loose hay with horses and buck rakes and  sulky rakes and those kinds of things. They   d throw it on the wagons  with pitch forks and they had a man on the wagon stacking it so they  could get the maximum load. The old barn we   ll see when we go up  there, if we do take some pictures, had a huge door up in the loft. They  would let it down with a cable and there was a giant hook that came out  of the top of the barn that went down to the wagon. You opened it up all  you could and then with a team of horses on the other end of the barn  going that a way pulled it up. It went down a rail and when you got it  32  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  where you wanted it you had a pull rope, and you pulled the rope and the  hook opened and dropped it in there. Then you had a man in there to  stack it in the barn. And that   s the way they   d put up the hay. Donnie  and I   s job was to pull this cable back so the hook would come out. It  had a rope on it. We   d get a hold of that rope, tie it around the saddle  horse and horn and pull it back. And you would get it up here to the end,  and by then it would drop down on the wagon again, but you pulled it  back with the saddle horse. They unhooked the cable from the team  down on the other end and it just drug itself back up. He   d drive the  team up and hook back up and when they hollered he would take off and  that lifted the hay up into the barn.  Did they figure this system out or did someone else?  Probably someone, a farmer figured it out. I don   t know how they  figured it out.  Probably perfected it as they went along.  Do you do the round hay bales now?  We do now. Yes. We don   t even own our own baler. We   ve got a family  friend over there north of Cushing, Louis Jeske, who has baled our hay  for several years.  What   s been the biggest invention that has helped with your farming  operation over the years?  Well that   s one of them. Those square bales would kill you. I   ve hauled  thousands and thousands of them in my time and I couldn   t do it  anymore. So crawling in a truck and hauling round bales has certainly  been an advantage over the old square ones. We still put up a few  squares. We put up 250 this year to have some around for the sick, lame  and the lazy animals, stuff like that.  We get to take care of those.  So we still put up a few squares and haul them in the 100 degree heat.  There is no future in that.  With the milking     Oh, yes.  Well we did square ones most of the time when we were milking. The  last few years we   ve had round bales.  33  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  When milking machines were invented, that was great because Mom and  Dad and, of course, their parents milked by hand. They, both Mom and  Dad   s families delivered milk. They bottled milk and delivered milk in  town. And Mom can still go by a house and tell you,    Oh, we used to go  drop milk off here, we dropped milk off there. Oh so and so lived there,     you know. When the milking machines came, we thought that was the  greatest thing. Then the parlor, a more automated system, came along  and we built that in the 1970s. I was just out of school and starting my  career and Darrell came back and he and his family got to milk mostly in  the new barn.  We started really getting after the milking business in 1953. Dad went to  Wisconsin, him and several other people in the area, and they bought  some dairy heifers up there and brought them home, calved them out,  and that   s when we got to milking in earnest. They had been milking by  hand prior to that. I think that   s the year we put in the surge milker  buckets, wasn   t it?  Probably, that would be about right.  But we had a six-stanchion barn up there at the home place, our home  place. Three in and three out. Three in and three out. Put in a pipeline  and ran it through the wall.  And a bulk tank.  And went into a bulk tank. Prior to that we had been milking into  buckets. I remember putting the strainer on top of ten gallon cans and  pouring it through the strainer and those cans were almost as high as I  was tall. Then we had a front loading cooler and cold water ran over the  cans.  They were always really good to cool watermelon too. That was one of  the greatest things, though. You never get watermelon cold any other  way.  In the summer time we always had a watermelon in there.  And homemade ice cream?  That was big then, really big. Everybody had a freezer and that was a big  deal. They weren   t those little dinky ones. They were two and a half  gallon freezers. They were big things.  Then we went from the cans, ten gallon cans, and that cooler to a bulk  tank. I remember that was quite an operation getting that bulk tank down  34  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  there in that milk house.  They had to tear out the wall and then put it back to get it down in there.  What was it? 500 gallon?  I think it was.  That was large, and that   s a lot of milk.  That   s a lot of milk.  That first one might not have been that big. Seemed like maybe it was,  too, I don   t know.  The milk truck would come, I think, every other day and pick up the  milk, usually in the middle of night and take it for processing usually in  the city, Oklahoma City. So the greatest invention was the milking  machine, for us probably, because of the dairy operation and  refrigeration. And, of course, water was a big plus. Just to have running  water for in the house.  Yes, that   s one of the reasons why we, amongst other things, when we  built the new dairy we built it down here because the barn sits about that  far off of a city water main. At that time Cushing was getting their water  from the city lake and they had three lines that ran from the city lake  back over northwest of here, right through our place. So it was kind of a  no brainer to build a dairy down there close to the water and, of course,  we always had plenty of water. I think that the closest line is only about  three or four feet from the dairy barn. Then with the complaining over  the years about the roll over and the stinky water Cushing went all to  wells. So we get it backwards now. We used to get it coming from the  lake, now we get it from the wells back this way. My house is still on  City of Cushing water. Nancy and Chip are on rural water.  And Mom is on rural water.  That was another blessing for this community was the rural water  cooperation.  Well, it started with Big Creek Rural Water didn   t it?  Yes.  And Dad was instrumental in getting that started. He served on the  Lincoln County Rural Water District Board for a long time.  35  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Well, until he died.  Yes.  He was still on the board for the Rural Water District.  How many head of cattle are we talking about?  Well, when we were milking in the old barn with the six stanchions we  probably milked 50     30, 40, 50.  At the very most. And then when they built the new dairy barn, the  parlor type, more than 100     We averaged 100, year around twice a day. You knew where you were  going to be every day. It   s just like being in a prison with no fences  because you are going to be there. (Laughs)  And that was enough to keep the family afloat or were there other  sources of income besides the dairy?  That was it. Nobody ever worked outside the home. Mom was always a  helper right along beside Dad as Grandma Jane was with Grandpa.  Grandpa worked outside the home or outside on the farm until he  became deputy sheriff. Let   s see, and Dad worked for Shell for a little  while but that was only about a year or two. And then     Shell moved a bunch of people out of Cushing and he had a chance to  move and stay with Shell and move up but he elected not to do that. He  didn   t want to move. He wanted to stay here at the farm. So no telling  we might be living in Illinois or some place.  He enjoyed farming and he enjoyed working for himself so the dairy  operation was the soul income.  We did a little bit of custom work. We were one of the first people  around here to have a silage cutter. We had an old silage cutter that, well  we bought it new, pulled behind the, a little 1947 Ford tractor and had a  Wisconsin air cooled engine on it. It was a powerful deal and we cut a  lot of silage for a lot of people around here.  We got paid for that?  Oh, I am sure he did for some of it, maybe. I don   t know.  36  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  He was always doing so many things for other people that I am  surprised.  It may have been a trade out. They would, we put it, like the thrashing,  we put up silage they might come up and help haul ours in and then he   d  trade out cutting theirs. Could have been a deal like that, I don   t know  for sure. But we ran that thing all over this county, almost, cutting the  silage in the early days and a little bit of combining.  For us kids to have money to spend or go to college, we had our 4-H  projects and we earned premium money. Janice and I worked at the  Dairy Hut in town. I don   t know if the boys ever got to work for  anybody away from the farm or not. I don   t remember them doing that.  We might go help somebody but I don   t remember ever getting paid for  an outside job. Mostly it was just helping at our place.  We had checking accounts and savings accounts and we tried to put all  of our money in the bank then we would have enough money to buy a  project. Once and a while we would have to take a loan at the bank.  Then we earned enough money to pay it off and when the project had to  be sold, a cow that was no longer useful, or a sheep or pig or whatever,  then we would sell it and we could get that money. That   s usually how  we saved our money and that helped us go to college or scholarships.  In 1957, we were in a severe drought. I had a sizeable hog project. I had  ninety head of hogs on the feed.  Ninety? Nine zero?  Nine-zero. The pond was going dry. We had a water line laid from that  pond west of the house down to the hog pen. Pond wouldn   t run any  water so we were hauling water to those hogs. The market went kaput,  eleven cents a pound. I lost a cool  1000 on my hog project and my  project record book with the FFA went with that hog project.  Is that the summer that those four gilts died?  I don   t remember whether that was. I think that was later when the four  gilts died.  The heat was just so bad that they just laid down one summer day and  died.  Well we had a drip. We had a drip on that same deal. I didn   t get it  checked and it mudded in or quit. I don   t even remember for sure but  37  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  anyways it ran out of water and four beautiful gilts died up there and it  would make you sick. Live and learn, you know, can   t be too careful  when you   re raising critters.  And water is important, isn   t it?  Yes.  At least you seem to have some trees for shade.  Yes. We   ve always had plenty of trees. When they got the wildfires  controlled then we had all this brush and trees.  Now we have more than we need.  Now you said you did some terracing and what other types of  conservation efforts did you use?  Well, one of the first major projects was on this Thompson place that  was over east of the old home place. It had been farmed in cotton, in  cotton, in cotton and cotton. But the ground basically washed away all of  the top soil because it had lots of ditches and stuff like that. When we  bought it they had the soil conservation people come out and shoot it,  what they call, with the levels. So we got a dozer in there and built some  diversion ditches and got all that controlled. Then we   ve built several  waterways     Ponds     Ponds. And the Eaton place, when we bought it after they blew the dam,  it had gullies down in there that you could stand on top of a bulldozer  down on the bottom, you couldn   t even see the person. They were that  big. We rebuilt the dam and then sloped all the gullies and put it to  Bermuda grass. It really looks quite nice now, better than what it did  back in those days. The place across from my road, the same farm had a  30 acre field that had a big old concrete, I think they called it gasoline  plant from the old days. We dug a huge hole down there and broke it up  and shoved it in the hole and covered it back up. Got rid of it and that  made a really nice field out of it, only a 30 acre field, but it   s a nice  field. Various other projects, we built some silt dams to slow down the  water that same place where we replaced the huge dam. Then we went  down at the end of the property and built a silt dam and its    got a drain  pipe in it and it slows down the water enough that it doesn   t wash  anymore so that   s a plus. We got some more we need to do. We got two  places that need another dam built right now to slow erosion but all  those things are very expensive. Dozer work now is hundreds of dollars  38  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  an hour when it used to be  30,  40,  50,  80. Now it   s out of sight with  fuel costs and everything and the repairs. It takes a lot of money.  One of things that I think that for posterity purposes is this Cimarron  Family Legends  book . It was put together by families in 1978, and it  has two stories about the Stiles    in it. One was written by a great-granddaughter,  Joy Stanton, about George W. Stiles and has some  pictures. Another one was written by Mazey Cox Reed and it was  primarily about Grandpa, Lee Stiles, the deputy sheriff. She also taught  at Hillside school. When we were talking about Mrs. Bateson and Mr.  Bateson. And then one of the books that was actually written by George  W. Stiles is the Early days in the Sac   Fox Country. And it   s in the  Chronicles of Oklahoma published by Oklahoma Historical Society. It  tells about the run, a lot of details, a lot of what we tried to talk about but  he does it in much more detail. And some of the people that were in the  run and the Sooners and the squatters and some of the conflicts and even  scary moments.  Them Sooners have been a problem for a long time.  They have been a problem for a long time. (Laughter)  The farm has been in the family for a long time, what do you envision  the next hundred years for it?  I don   t know if the economy doesn   t change it   s going to really be  tough. We have pretty much quit the actual farming as far as working  massive amounts of the ground. We used to work over 200 acres every  year and plant wheat. Basically we used it for hay. Now we   ve pretty  much changed all that and put it to grass and hope to increase the size of  cow herd enough to hopefully someday pay off the debt. Not sure we are  going to do that in our lifetime but we   re working at it. The only ground  we   re actually going to till and farm now is about, probably, 80 or 90  acres of rented ground on two different places. We   ll probably continue  to till and plant a crop there but there again most of it, all of it will be  livestock feed. If we make a crop it will be, one of them will be pastured  out and the other will be baled. Then, well that same place right now we  got cattle running on it because after we baled the hay we had a good  stand of the crab grass so we moved some cattle on it. Most of it   ll be  leased in the near future for a cow/calf operation. We   ve got pure bred  Angus, we got pure bred Simmental. The largest amount of livestock is  commercial cows of an Angus and Simmental cross, and 97 or 98   black.  When we sold the dairy in 1988 or 1989, I always forget which year that  was, Dad and Darrell talked a lot about,    Okay, how am I going to  39  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  survive now? What   s going to be my livelihood?    And they found some  cattle up in Kansas and decided to have a beef cattle operation and so  that   s how we got into the cow/calf operation. It started with the Angus I  guess, buying half Angus and they were Angus-Hereford cross?  Well, we had a beef cow herd started long before that because we had  bred     A few.  We had always bred the heifers to an Angus bull so we had a Holstein-  Angus cross, black female and we had a pretty good number of those.  Then, obviously you needed larger numbers so we bought 63 head out of  the lime stone country up in Kansas at Cassidy, Kansas. Forty-three of  them, I think, were Angus and the other amount was Hereford- Angus  cross, baldies. Then we used Simmental bull on those for several years.  And in the 1960s Darrell had started a Simmental herd.  In 1968 the Simmental got to be kind of big in this country. They started  getting popular and they had four bulls that they had transported in to the  United States from Switzerland. The semen was available from two  private bull studs, Curtis Breeding Services and ABS was in business.  Then they had two bulls available through what they called the co-op  bull studs. And I was working for the Kansas Artificial Breeding Service  Unit (KABSU) at Manhattan that was owned by Kansas State  University. Myself and three other guys formed a little group to breed.  We would make a deal with the owners, the cattle owners in Kansas that  we could convince, that we   d breed them to Simmental bulls and then  give them a nickel above market price for the females. We got quite a  few takers and so that was in the fall of 1969 when we got that done. No,  we bred them in 1968, in the fall of 1968 and the cattle were born the  next year and then weaned in May, probably May of 1970. So I left  Kansas in the summer of 1969, and then for my part of the group that we  had formed, they sent me ten head of heifers for the money that I had  invested. So, I really had some of the real early half blood Simmentals in  the country. My membership number will not reflect that because I  didn   t join the association till I was ready to register calves out of those  heifers. But I could have had a real early number as far as when I first  got involved because it was in 1968 and that   s when they had formed it.  But you brought the first Simmentals into Oklahoma     Yes. I think I may have had the first ones in the state of Oklahoma. In  those days the color was predominantly red and white and when I moved  back from KABSU, we got to breeding Holstein cows to Simmental  40  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  bulls. We had predominantly pure bred registered Holsteins but we also,  when we increased the herd, we had bought quite a few grade animals  and about a year or so after I moved back or maybe before that I started  breeding all the grade cows to Simmental bulls. We also piddled around  with Chianina and Main Anjou. First thing you know we started getting  some black ones, black and white ones. We thought that was terrible in  the very beginning and first thing you know then the black ones got real,  real popular. But we had early on, with the upgrading in the Simmental  program, made some big money in the beginning. Course we don   t hit it  that hard anymore, not that involved. We did start aing some cows this  year to Simmental bulls, but for several years I didn   t hit that very hard.  We still do a lot of natural service. We got quite a few pure bred  Simmental. But we got pure bred Simmental, registered Angus and then  most of them are commercial cows, Angus-Simmental cross.  I don   t know how you keep up with it.  It   s a challenge. But Nancy has been doing all the bookwork since she  moved back and that helped a bunch. That   d drive me nuts if I tried to  do all the bookwork.  If he   d just tell me where they get moved and how many, but I am  usually there to help move so, I just kind of keep track of it.  With that many you almost need your own private vet.  Yes. We spend quite a bit of vet money.  He   s a good friend. (Laughter) Good friend.  We   ve been lucky that way. The veterinarian we were using before I  ever left home was still here when I came home and he wanted to get  into the Simmental business. So I bred cows for him for a year or two  and then he trained himself to do his own. And that got pretty popular  back in those days   owners doing their own animals. But I actually  helped him get into the Simmental business. He retired a few years  before he got killed    We did a lot of Simmental things together. He  sold out to another vet and we   ve been really tight, close personal  friends, above and beyond the professional relationship. So we   ve been  blessed that way as far as veterinary service.  How much would a bull cost? I have no clue.  Well, it   s relative, you know?  It varies a lot.  41  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Chipukites  Stiles  Chipukites  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  Chipukites  Finchum  Stiles  Finchum  Stiles  They   re everything from a  1000 to  1500 to  70,000 or  80,000. It  depends on the bloodline, the confirmation. How much advertising  you   ve done sometimes helps a bunch. Sometimes it doesn   t help any.  The reputation the herd has.  Yes, a lot of different factors.  You mentioned having an early number, was that significant?  In the membership?  No, not really.  Just how long he had been associated with the Simmental.  I guess what I was trying to say, my association with the breed is not  reflective from my membership number. My membership number is  1638 but I actually had cattle and could have been probably a 50, 60  number if I had joined in the beginning. They formed the organization  the same year we started buying semen and breeding cows in 1968.  Forty years ago. Is there anything I haven   t asked that you want to get  on tape?  I don   t know, we better not think of it or we   ll be here forever. (Laughs)  We may do a round two later, at a different time. If not, thanks for this.  It has been great.  Well we appreciate you taking the interest and spending the time doing  it.  Hopefully 100 years from now people will look back and find it very  interesting and maybe family members will even learn some things that  they didn   t know.  Hopefully great, great, great-grandkids will still be sitting here.  They probably aren   t going to believe it anyway. (Laughter)  Well, thank you.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------  42
