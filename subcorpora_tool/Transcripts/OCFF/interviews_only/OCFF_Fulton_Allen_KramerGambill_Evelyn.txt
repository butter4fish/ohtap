 Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at the OSU Library. Also with me today is Tanya  Finchum. Today is Wednesday, November 10, 2010, and we   re on the  Daniel Kramer Homestead interviewing Allen Fulton and Evelyn  Kramer-Gambill as part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families oral  history project. We   d like to start today by learning a little bit about  your family. Can you tell us how they originally came to Oklahoma?  Grandpa was born on June 14, 1871. At that time, they lived in  Rosamond, Illinois, R-O-S-A-M-O-N-D. His parents came to the United  States from Germany, but he was born in the United States. All their  children were born in the United States. He bought a  relinquishment   from Asa Brown, A-S-A Brown, on October 10, 1895. Mr. Brown had  lost his wife in childbirth on April 12, 1895, and did not want to stay on  the homestead. So, Grandpa settled up on the establishment. His  residence prior to April 1, 1896, settled up on and established his  residence prior to April 1, 1896. Improvements   now, do you want me  to get involved in that too?  Sure.  Improvements that were made were a hundred dollar stable and crib  worth fifty dollars, chicken house and cave, which is the cellar, worth  twenty-five dollars, one water well worth forty-five dollars, an orchard  of about one and half acres worth seventy-five dollars, fencing on a  claim worth seventy-five dollars and about sixty acres of broke land  worth sixty dollars. The claim was part timbered, part prairie, farming  and grazing of mixed soil, mostly sandy loam. He raised crops for six  seasons, about thirty acres in 1896, fifty-five acres in 1897, and about  sixty acres from 1898 to May of 1902.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Why don   t you tell me what you remember about him?  Well, I was born in    31 and my dad and mother had been married four  years. But anyway, when I was old enough to see things, they had this  big, red silo. You may have seen it driving down the road, and it was the  only one in the country here. Anyway, it was seen by a lot of people.  They raised loose  hay . They didn   t bale it, because it was loose hay  then. They had a deal that came down and it was tied to a post. They had  a horse that pulled this and took this loose hay up to the top layer in the  old barn, and it was stored there. They had a well on the back porch of  the house for their water.  Would they pump it?  Yes, just a pump, and that was just for the house use. I   m not sure how  they really got water. I don   t know what year they drilled a well just  down by the barn for cattle and all that. I think they had managed some  way to put a pump on it. I don   t know just how they did that. But I was  an outside girl, and I went with my dad when I was able to walk. I just  was with him outside a lot. They had in this barn twelve stanchions. Is it  stanchions?  Stanchions.  Stanchions that they put the cows in and they milked cows for their  milk. And then they put a separator in the well house. At that time, it  was run by hand, separating the milk and cream. Well, they had a place  on the opposite side of the cows in the barn that they had horses and of  course, everything was done by horse. I shouldn   t add what Grandpa  says. (Laughs) He didn   t have much patience with horses. (Laughter)  Really? Why was that?  Oh, they just wouldn   t always do what he wanted them to when he went  in the barn. He had a saying but I don   t think I   ll repeat it. (Laughter)  But it was something I kind of remember about Grandpa. And then they  built a granary. Well, they built south of the water and barn down there.  Would you just call it the granary?  Yes, there were grain bins and grain storage. I don   t know when they put  in the grinder for mixing and making their own feed.  Yes. I thought you would remember that. Now see, you remember some  things I don   t.  Well, I mean, you can remember a lot of it off of memory. What I  6  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  remember is what I   ve been told. It   s a little different scenario, because  it   s what my grandfather, your dad, has passed on to me and telling me  about how the farm was done and the things that had happened with it.  What you   re able to give us is what you remember of it so that makes it  good too.  Well, from now on, you probably remember more of what went on,  because you were with Dad a lot.  Well, what do you remember of the old house?  Well     How big was it? How many rooms?  The house that you were raised in. Either go back to that or the one that  Great-Grandpa Dan would   ve lived in, because there were two houses  down there.  You can still see the rock bedroom. It   s on this end. It had an upstairs  and all I know is what was there after I was born. I didn   t see what  Grandpa had or anything.  Sure.  It had a nice, large dining area. They had a nice kitchen. One of Dad   s  brothers worked in a carpenter   s shop or something, in Tulsa. He   d built  the cabinets for them, but in later years, they rebuilt them. The first ones  had glass doors in them. They didn   t have when you saw them, did they?  I remember the old original cabinets.  Oh, okay.  There were some of those still around. Now, the house that you were  raised in, wasn   t it the old white house, the long running house? Did you  all live in it at all, or was it the other big house over there?  No. Mother and Daddy lived in the upstairs the first few years they were  married, but they built Mother and Dad a house. That was the one I was  born in. It was the new one that went this way (gestures). I don   t think  you ever saw it.  No, I   ve never seen that.  When my grandparents were both gone, Mother and Daddy and family  7  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  moved into, we called it    the big house.    Grandpa was still alive then  and he lived in the bedroom that was below the upstairs, in the rock part.  By then, they had built a bathroom right in that part of the house that  Grandpa could go from his room right into the bathroom. There was a  hallway between the two rooms. His part of the house and then the  kitchen, the dining room. That south end of the house, when they rebuilt  it, at first, it was the living room and it had two bedrooms on the north  side. You probably don   t remember that.  I don   t even remember that part.  Did it have electricity?  Well, I think it must   ve been about    42 when they got the Indian Electric  because Dad helped his dad.  So, when you were younger, no electricity?  Well, it wasn   t too long after that. That was way before you ever saw the  engine down in the shop.  Yes.  Dad had some kind of battery-run generator     That would produce electricity.  And so we did have electricity. I can   t tell you what year it was.  And what would it power?  Well, we had lights. There was a light in the barn, a light in the pump  house     Did you have an icebox or a refrigerator?  Oh, Grandma, in that house, had something. They didn   t even call it a  refrigerator, I don   t think, but it ran that somehow. So we were able to  keep things. I can   t remember when we got the first electric refrigerator.  (Laughs) That   s been a long time ago.  What about the washer?  Oh, that was a fun time. (Laughter) Daddy built    I don   t think it was  one of the first things. Anyway, Daddy built a washhouse, and I   m not  sure how it ran.  8  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Was that the washhouse and the canning house?  Yes.  Because I remember the old hand-wring washing machine that used to  sit out in the corner of it, but that   s where they did all the canning, too.  Yes. Of course, we didn   t have hot water tanks and all, then. Just outside  the yard gate, do you remember, they had a washtub. They were kind of  oblong and they built a fire under it and heated the wash water, and then  took it out to the washhouse. I   d even forgotten about that.  What about bath time? What was that like?  Oh  (Laughs) Well, Grandma and Grandpa had a bathtub in that  bathroom. I think you just heated water and carried it in. They had a  stool at that time and a septic tank and it would drain out to that. Before  we moved back into the big house, the house that Daddy had built for us  was a really nice house, but it was very small. That other house that you  see, that went north and south?  Yes.  Okay, that was the house up on Waneta and Royce   s farm.  They moved it down from the old Cushman place?  They moved it down from the old Cushman place and set it up there. We  made a walkway and a porch so we could be under shelter when we  walked into that, because that was where our bedrooms were. Prior to  that, when his mother, my sister, was born, we had a bed in the living  room. Mother and Dad had a screened in porch opposite the kitchen and  it had a canvas or something to shut out the cold, which wasn   t a whole  lot. It was screened and in the wintertime, they had this, whatever it was  that covered the windows, and they slept out there with lots and lots of  blankets. (Laughs) That was another reason why he moved that other  house in.  As a little girl, did you have chores?  Not when I was just barely walking and just following Dad, but yes.  Grandpa took care of the hogs, at that time. Dad and Mother milked the  cows. When I got old enough, I was right down there milking the cows. I  know my sister wanted to learn to drive a car, so, I had to be getting up  around sixteen or something. She never helped with any chores outside.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  She was the house girl with Mother. And I told Daddy,    That isn   t fair if  you let her learn to drive     I said,    I had to learn to milk cows.    I said,     Whenever she milks cows  she can learn to drive ,    and I don   t think  she ever milked cows. (Laughs) So, it was just little fun things, there.  So, before school you would milk cows?  Oh, no. I didn   t have to milk cows in the morning.  So, just after school, maybe?  Yes. At evening.  So, where would you go to school?  Oh, I   ve got that picture somewhere. To Meramec, which is just a mile  over there, isn   t it?  Yes.  The school is actually, pretty much just straight west of here, I think.  Yes, it   s just straight due west of here, but you   d have to go around the  mile to get there.  Well, when I was growing up, we had neighbors that lived on this little  hill across the road and they had some young children that walked down  to the corner. We had to catch the bus down where you turn to come  north. Dad had taken an old outhouse and put it on the corner so if it was  bad or cold, we could go stand in the house. He   d put a seat across it,  where we could go. Then, it wasn   t very many years after that, three or  four or something, my other granddad, my mother   s father, lived at  Meramec, and he became a driver of a school bus. It was kind of  interesting for us because picking Waneta and I up down there was the  first stop of the morning. Well, he would come out early, he would help  us finish doing the dishes, and then he would have a cup of coffee. Then  when it was time for him to leave, we got in the bus and went around,  quite a ways around.  You didn   t have to walk to the school bus anymore.  No, I didn   t. (Laughter) And then Waneta and I both graduated over  there. I can   t remember the year that they moved the high school. Well,  they moved the high school first, I think. But anyway, they just stopped  the school over there and they tore the building down.  10  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  It was just a big one-room schoolhouse, wasn   t it?  Oh, no.  Did it have multiple rooms?  Now, it probably was when Dad started to school over there. He went  over there and then I think it was high school   I didn   t go back far  enough, but it was a small school. The water, if you needed a drink, was  an outside pump and had this long pipe in it. If you got too close to it in  the winter, you stuck to it. And the outhouses always got turned over at  Halloween. (Laughter) They had one this way for girls and the other one  was clear down on the other side. But when I went to school it was a  nice, brick schoolhouse. I saw some of those pictures when I was going  through stuff yesterday.  And what was the name of the school?  Just Meramec High School. Or Meramec School. Dad went there until  he got through grade school and then he went to Pawnee for high school.  He had an apartment that he   well, not an apartment really, it was a  family that took in roomers to stay when they were going to school.  He   d come home on the weekend and then go back. But he did not finish  high school, because he needed to be out helping with the farm work.  Well, coming back to the farm, what were some of the crops that were  being raised when you were growing up, off the top of your head?  Well, they always planted wheat and corn and back then, what was the  other grain that people used to grow?  They used to raise barley.  Barley, yes.  Clover.  Yes, Dad raised clover and was able to harvest it, because it was an  extensive crop, and you could sell clover.  They grew alfalfa also.  Yes.  Oats.  11  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Oh, yes. Your memory is better than mine. (Laughter)  Was it a family operation or did you have outside help?  Well, when it came to harvesting the grain, you had what was called a  binder. I don   t remember how early they had those. I don   t remember  anything early. But the binder, they went around and cut the grain when  it was ripe. It was tied somehow.  Tied it up in bundles.  Bundles, and then you had to stack those bundles for, I don   t know, a  few days or something. You had people that stacked the grain. Then you  went around and you had a wagon, well, they called them hay rigs or, I  can   t remember, something like that. Anyway, you hired outside help to  come in and they would pick up the grain. Dad had a threshing machine  by then, and they drove one on each side of where you threw this grain.  So, he had help for that and then when you did some haying, you had to  have some help on that. I guess all that grain.  Well, a lot of them, different people from the community would work  together to put up their crops and their hay and everything like that.  Even whenever I was a kid, Grandpa was putting up wheat harvest.  When we did wheat harvest, he had his own combine. We were  harvesting the wheat and the neighbor back to the east, Carl Anderson,  would take care of hauling or transporting all of the wheat, and Grandpa  would go cut his wheat for him doing that. They just kind of worked  together on a lot of that stuff that they did. Even down to their hay, they  had people through that that had come out and either cut hay for him or  raked hay for him for years. They would go do their hay and traded off a  lot of their work for a lot of that type of stuff.  Yes, that   s right.  Where would you take it to market?  Well, at that time, they used a lot of it, I think.  A lot of the grains and stuff that were harvested never   I shouldn   t say  never   some of them went to sale and went to market. I know we used  to transport a lot of wheat and stuff back up to Skedee, and they sold it at  Skedee or at Pawnee would be the marketplaces where they would take  it. But most of the grains and stuff that were grown on the farm were  used on the farm. It was basically (this is what had always been told to  me) a self-sufficient farm. They didn   t have to go outside for anything.  They grew all their feed for their animals, right here. They would take  12  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  animals to sell. They raised animals that would go to sale in Oklahoma  City, would be transported down there on an old truck, the old    49  Chevy that had the high sideboards on it. They would be either hauling  hogs or hauling cattle that they sold down there. They raised everything  that it took to keep those cattle and those hogs and chickens. All of their  own feed and everything was grown right here, on the place. How often  did they ever go to town to get anything, I mean even back then, back  when you were milking the cows and stuff still?  See, they had grocery stores over in Meramec. In fact, they had three  grocery stores at one time. They had a movie theater, restaurants, and a  bank.  At that time, you weren   t very far away from town. Town was just a  mile away.  Yes.  Did the railroad go through Meramec?  Yes, and they built the big lake over there so the railroad could get  water. They had a big   what are the places where the railroad stops and  people can get on and off?  Depot?  Depots, yes.  Depot. Have to pardon my senior moments. (Laughs)  So, it was a happening little town.  Yes.  It was a very big oil boom town, Meramec was.  Yes, it was.  So, when your mom or grandma would go to town, go to the grocery  store, what were some of the staples they were buying?  Well, at that time, they were making butter here, and they would take  butter over and sell it, and they would take eggs over and sell them. I can  remember when they first were able to buy store-bought bread. I guess  they got it from a bakery. I don   t know how they got it, because I don   t  remember that. But it was a big deal when Grandma bought a loaf of  13  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  bread, and she   d let us take a slice out before we ever got home.  (Laughs) It was something. Other than that, I can   t really remember  exactly what they did buy. I was still pretty young.  What did you like better, the store-bought bread or Grandma   s bread?  Oh, I think it was just the idea of the store-bought. I think homemade  stuff is hard to beat. They churned the butter. (Laughs) His mother loved  butter. We caught her one day (she   s younger than I am). The churn was  big and it was where you   d turn it by hand. They   d take all the butter out  and make butter in little squares. She was out there trying to get in that  churn and get some more butter. (Laughter) You   ll have to tell her about  that sometime.  Well, just for a frame of reference for a minute, Daniel Kramer had how  many kids?  He had five. I   ve got it down somewhere. I think it was five. I think he  had four boys, Floyd, Tim, Dad, and Dale. That would be four, and the  oldest one was a sister.  And did they all live on the farm?  Well, until they grew up enough to go to work.  And your father, his name was?  Herbert.  Herbert, okay. And Herbert lived on the farm?  Yes. And none of the other children stayed at the farm. Dad lived on it  and helped. Well, when I first remember Grandpa, he was getting old  enough that he wasn   t really able to do much farm work. None of the  others wanted it, so Grandpa deeded Daddy forty acres that he could call  his own, and then Grandpa (all that   s in those other homestead papers)  later just deeded all the farm down here to Dad.  And was it one hundred and sixty acres?  Yes, eventually. He started out with forty and then I think eighty, but he  got the one hundred and sixty. Actually I think it was     Well, the original deal that Daniel Kramer, Great-Grandpa would have  had, was originally one hundred and sixty acres. And that   s still what it  is today, is one hundred and sixty acres.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Now, your dad married     Yes, my mother   s name was Maudie, M-A-U-D-I-E, and her maiden  name was Allen. And she was well-known for her cooking. She was  always there to help somebody. The other members of the family knew  what a good cook she was. It was nothing new to come home on Sunday  from church and Mother would have dinner about ready and here would  fly in some of the family with their families for dinner, unannounced.  (Laughter)  I   ll get back to her and her cooking in a second. And then how many  children did Herbert and Maudie have?  Just Waneta, his mother, and I. Just the two.  Two girls, okay.  And Paden is the only great-grandson so he   s been kind of special.  (Laughter)  So, for a typical meal on a Sunday? What would your mother cook?  Oh, Mother would go out and kill a chicken before we went to church,  and she would have that all ready to fry when she came home from  church.  Did she have a technique when it came to killing the chicken?  Everybody seems to have a different technique.  Well, Mother had a tree stump, I think it was, that Dad had fixed and she  kind of had a   I   m not sure if it was an axe. She had the ability to chop  off their head and then she went about     Defeathering?  Yes, pulling the feathers off, and she did good chicken. And she usually  had something baked.  Did you have a favorite meal she used to cook?  Actually, they were all good. The one thing I liked was, I think it was a  chicken breast. I liked the white meat best. There was a cousin or  something who liked the same thing I did. I had to give up my piece  when we had company. I can remember doing that. (Laughs)  15  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Would she do much canning?  Oh, heavens, yes.  What would she can?  Okay, this side of the house that   s really deteriorating, Grandpa had a  great big garden and then right straight, where the fence is, he had an  orchard. It was a big orchard, and I can remember pear trees and  crabapple trees, grapes, peaches. In the garden, Grandpa had grapes and  of course, you   d plant a lot of potatoes, onions, green beans, and a lot of  corn. They canned all that until there were freezers and then they  would   of course, that was after Grandpa was gone   but Mother would,  they would freeze it a lot. And for our meat, they would slaughter a cow  out in the runway from the water tank, east. They would slaughter a cow  and then you had to can the meat, because there were no freezers or  anything. Until there got to be freezers, well, they canned the meat.  And did you have to learn how to can?  Well, I had to help can, but that was not the meat, it was later when we  had all that garden stuff. Mother   s sister would come up and they   d can  so they could get some veggies. Grandpa planted watermelon and  cantaloupe. I   m probably talking too much and taking too much time.  You   re doing good.  Well, I   m about up to the point that I left the farm. (Laughter)  Let me ask you one more question. You mentioned the water source.  There was a pump?  Yes.  And later, they dug a well out for the cows.  Yes.  Any other sources of water on the farm?  Well, Dad ran running water from the well down for cattle. He ran that  up and we had water in the house, running water, in the bathroom and  everything, in the house.  That one down there at the barn did it originally   at one time, I can  remember seeing some pictures of a big tank. Did it actually have a  16  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  windmill and everything on it too, at one time?  Oh, yes, right. That   s how we were able to get water to the house.  It was a windmill pump that originally started pumping and then had a  big overhead tank and stuff up there that they kept the water in.  That   s been so long ago.  But that was the original type of pump that actually pumped that well,  was through wind power.  And every once in a while, Dad would have to climb up there and kind  of clean it out or something.  Well, Allen, as a little boy, what do you remember about the farm? What  are some of your early farm memories?  It was always a fun place to be. No matter where or what you were  doing, it was something to get out of town and come out here. I was  actually born in Tulsa. My mom and dad lived there for a few years. We  moved here in 1972, lived on the farm just to the north of here, but prior  to actually moving here, I spent a lot of time up here just going out and  helping my grandfather, which was Herbert, being with him on the farm  and taking care of all the animals and everything that pertained to farm  life, whether it was something with the animals or the wheat or the  grains and the crops, putting them in.  At that time, whenever I was little, they didn   t milk cows anymore. One  of the main things that I can remember Grandma going to town for was  to buy milk. She would buy four or five gallons every time she went to  town, and that was one of the main things that they bought then was  milk, when they went to town. It was something, that and her bread. She  did buy bread and stuff when she went into town. Going into town at  that time was going into Pawnee. I can remember as a kid, I thought that  was an all-day trip to have to go to Pawnee and come back out here to  the farm. It was just something terrible that took way too much time.  A lot of, like I say, fun experiences of helping and learning about the  farm, and the things to do on the farm as far as taking care of the animals  and the land. My grandfather was not only a farmer, but he was a great  conservationist in a lot of the things that he did. Some of the early  conservation practices in Pawnee County are things that happened right  here on this farm with terracing, crop rotations, trying to help the land  and the water situations in any way that was possible.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Did he work with any county agents?  He was actually on the County Conservation Board of Directors for I  don   t remember how many years. I   d hate to quote that, but it was very  many years. He had been on there for a long time. It was something that  was really near and dear to his heart, the Conservation District and the  work that they did with the Conservation District, and going out and  trying to help other farmers learn about soil conservation and water  conservation for the land. There was nothing that meant more to him  than the land itself and taking care of it. That was part of it to him. It was  something that was going to be here from now on and we had to take  care of it.  So, as a little boy, what was one of the first things you ran to on the farm  when you came to visit? Something you just really enjoyed doing.  Oh, it would probably have to be the tractors and the equipment and that  type of stuff. I was always fascinated with that. As I got a little older, I  learned not to be quite as fascinated, because you   d spend many, many  hours on it with some of the ways of farming back then when they  actually turned the soil and plowed all the fields. (Laughter)  A lot of the no-till drilling that takes place nowadays, there was a lot of  acreage on this one hundred and sixty acres that they had several  different, smaller plots of seventeen to seven acre patches, a seventeen  acre patch, twenty acre patch. Those areas were rotated in crops so they  would plow the soils every year. Some of your alfalfas you   d put it in  and it might be in there for four years, but your other two fields would  be rotated from wheat and oats, barley, clover. I can remember it just  seeming like it was taking weeks and weeks to plow one small field, but  they had a lot of smaller equipment then. My grandfather   s big tractors  back then   I   ve got one of his original 1948 Ford 8N tractors that when  he bought it brand new with the plow and the cultivator and everything,  it was something that was a big new tractor to them, at that time. Now,  it   s one of those that has a small enough horsepower that up until about  three years ago, we were using it in the hayfield to pull a hay rake with  once in a while, and still have it down there and can fire it up and run it  if we needed to today.  Currently, at this time, we   re not tilling any of the soils or putting them  into wheat or alfalfa or any type of crops at this time. We   ve put  everything back to native grass. We cut and bale a lot of hay, basically  to take care of our cattle. We sell a little hay outside, but it is gone from  that point of working the ground and the equipment. It   s still being done  in a certain way, but it   s not the point of turning the soil for planting  crops.  18  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Well, you   ve seen lots of changes from the seventies until today.  Oh, yes.  The farm has really moved from a self-sustaining operation to something  totally different. What are the types of things you   re doing on the farm  today?  Some of the things that we do differently now, like I say, we don   t turn  the soil. We   re not planting any crops. The ground needed to rest. The  ground was worn out and it needed to go back and rest for a while. We  put everything back into grass. My dad put everything back into grass  several years ago, before I started running the farm. Some of the things  that we do now compared to in the past, where we talked a little bit  earlier, Evelyn talked about where the people would actually go work  for other people and do custom harvesting and that type of stuff. We   d  found some old records back years and years ago of where my  grandfather would actually go out and do custom hay baling for other  people, and some of the places that they did. He kept really good  records. It showed how many bales it made per acre, and they got into  great detail of what some of these lands did. It also showed the length of  time that it took them to do some of those places.  One of the places, for instance, that my grandfather used to do all the  custom hay work on, they would go spend maybe in the neighborhood of  a week to a week and a half putting up this eighty acres of hay. I do that  same eighty acres, outside hay work, now, and I do it in a day and a half.  So, there   s a lot of difference in the type of equipment and the way  things are done. With the bigger equipment, everything is faster, it   s less  labor intensive. We do that just within our own family. We don   t hire  outside help to come in like they were talking about for the harvest. It  took extra people, whereas now, us as a family, my wife and my son and  myself, we go out and do all of our custom hay work that we do, not  only on our own place, but outside to bring in part of our income for the  farm.  You were mentioning earlier about conservation efforts, and you  mentioned briefly about terracing. Were there any ponds built?  Yes, there were several ponds built. If I can go back just a little bit into  what I have been told about the place. Prior to Evelyn living on it, this  place was actually come by my great-grandfather. He bought it three  days after the Land Run. He had to go through and follow through with  all of the improvements that they required for the Land Run and show  that, and the witnesses that had to come in and sign everything. There  19  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  had to be so many acres that were cleared. There are places over here,  where they have gone in on the hillsides and cleared all the timber out,  put it into grasses and actually some of those are into improved grasses  now, where they   re Bermuda grass.  There were ponds that were built for livestock water. Some of those  ponds are set up so that they   re in the areas where terracing brings the  water into the ponds to help fill the ponds. This place does not have that  many on it. It is adjoined to another place where the ponds that are used,  livestock can go across into other areas. The creek that runs through this  place is a big portion of the livestock watering. This time of year, right  now, we haven   t had any rain in a long time. For the most part, a lot of  that creek is dry. There are still pockets of that creek that are deep  enough that still have standing fresh water in them. And it doesn   t take a  lot of rain to have water flowing through the farm itself so that is one of  our main water resources. There are a couple of ponds on it though, like  I say, that were built for the purpose of retaining water for livestock.  Throughout time, did your grandfather have to have an outside job or  was the farm his job? And the same for your father.  Evelyn can answer a lot of that more. My father never had the farm as a  full-time job at all. He worked outside in Tulsa, basically, the majority  of his life. He worked outside everywhere up until he was retired and  then he did run cattle on it, after he was retired from another job. My  grandfather, Herbert Kramer, this was basically it. He never had an  outside job anywhere other than working on the farm. Up until six years  ago, probably, it was right at six years ago, I had worked outside. We  had run everything up to the point of where my father was running cattle  on this operation and trying to keep up after he had retired from working  in Tulsa. I had been working outside all of these years and then when we  had bought the original homestead, here, off of my aunt   how many  years ago was that? What year was that?  Well, you bought it in    97.  Well, we were still currently, at that time, working. I was working  outside at another job up until about six years ago. And due to some  factors that happened with my job there, where I was working, we  actually   my wife and I went back to, basically, farming. Now, we   re  not able to say that this one hundred and sixty acres is a self-sufficient  farm or we   re making a living off of this one hundred and sixty acres.  We rent a lot of other pastures, we run cattle on other pastures, we  process and put up a lot of hay every summer, not only on other lands  that we lease that we may sell hay off of, but we do custom hay baling  outside for other people.  20  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  All of these old farms around that we   re talking about are centennial  farms that are over a hundred years old   all of these old farms have  fencing on them that are over a hundred years old, and if you   ve ever  been around any of that, as soon as you touch it, it just breaks in your  hands. I guess I could say through my grandfather, one of the things that  he taught me was how to build fence. And we had to build a lot of fence  on our place and keep the fences up on here, and just kind of by word of  mouth, we do a lot of outside work building fence every year. I   m  actually a welder by trade so it   s kind of something that falls into place  with not only our farm, but other farms throughout the community and  the county and the area, that we do outside jobs. We   re not truly working  at an outside job somewhere, but we are custom hiring to many other  places building fence for them, building corrals, doing dirt work,  whatever. We supplement our farm income by working on other farms  also.  You know, farming has definitely changed through the years. I think it   s  harder to just be a farmer and that   s your job. How many acres do you  think you need to make a living farming? Centennial farms are usually  one hundred and sixty acres. If you had to put a number on an  acreage   ?  Well, I don   t know. That would be really hard to figure. One hundred  and sixty  acres  was what they originally set up back in the Land Run.  They said,    Okay, that   s all anybody would ever need.    I know that my  grandfather had chances to buy some other properties around here and  he didn   t know what he would do with it. There would just be no way  that he could upkeep it and run any more cattle than what he was  running. He just didn   t have enough time in the day. It would be hard to  say, because you can get up to a certain point that if one person   we   re  talking about if one person or one family is trying to operate that   that  you could wind up with more work there than you could take care of and  it would start going the other way.  It   s kind of like your pastures. If you overgraze them, you lose. Well, it   s  the same way. If you try to take on more work than you can handle by  yourself, you either have to hire more people, which costs you more in  the long run, or you have to back up to that certain line to where it   s  something that you can handle and take care of an operation yourself  and settle for that point of it. So, I mean, I don   t really know what I  would say that you would have to have. I know that it would be more  than four hundred, four quarters. It would be more than a section of land  to be able to run enough cattle and hay operation and everything else. It  would take a lot more than one section for a person to make a living, to  be able to just get by.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Well, coming back to the farm today, what are some of the operations  going on?  Well, now today, we   re a little bit more diversified on the animals. I say     more,    we still run cattle just like they did years ago. We   ve got horses.  We   re not milking any cattle. My son, back when he was in high school,  started a goat operation where he is raising Boer goats. He was raising  those originally, starting out to be projects for 4-H and FFA, and it   s like  everything else. Everybody that I   ve ever talked to, when you start a  project like that and continue on with it, you have some of your best  animals after you get out of school. So, he is currently still living at  home with us and he works an outside job in Stillwater, but he has a goat  operation that has been able to raise a lot of really nice animals and sell  them to other people that are wanting to show animal projects. Not only  show for 4-H and FFA projects, but he   s raising the type of livestock  with his goat operation that people want to buy part of his breeding to  put on their places to start their own operations.  We used to have several horses around that we used. We   ve gotten away  from using the horses as much. We do have one horse still on the place  that we could go throw a saddle on and go chase cows if we needed to.  Nowadays, we go get on the quad and push a button and fire it up and go  chase cattle on it. It eats a little bit of gas and it   s a little easier to catch  most of the time than what the horse was, but we use a quad a little bit  more out in the pasture as far as getting around instead of doing it on  horseback.  Our tractors are three and four times bigger than the tractors that were  used back then. They had one big tractor, we   ve got four. At the same  time, when you get back into some of the equipment that they had back  then that you   re looking at, some of the tractors were maybe one  thousand to two thousand dollar tractors. You   re looking at tractors  nowadays that are twenty, thirty, forty, fifty thousand dollar tractors.  Your hay equipment   s the same way. It   s something that not only size-wise,  but dollar-wise, has really increased a lot. It takes a lot more to be  able to manage and have the equipment. Not only the equipment, but  then you get into your fuel costs. Your fuel and oils and stuff, back years  ago, they never thought much about it. They brought fuel in here. They  had an overhead fuel bin that they ran the tractors on. A lot of them ran  on propane. They didn   t use a whole lot of fuel. Nowadays, whenever  you go out there and you have a big overhead bin and in three days you  use all the fuel and you have to order more, it gets expensive. So, it can  be a costly, costly expense.  You   re also running cattle?  22  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Yes.  How many head?  Right now on this place, this hundred and sixty acres, will normally  handle about twenty head. That   s with our areas that are cut off that we  have for hay areas. Then, like I say, my wife and I, we run cattle outside  of this hundred and sixty acres and continue on with that operation and  just expand as much as we can, that we can work with and still have  enough time to manage it and take care of it.  Who gets to pull the calves?  Who gets to pull the calves? Whoever is there at the time. (Laughter)  That   s always the big thing. We   ve been very fortunate. We   ve had to  pull a lot of calves. We do have to do that from time to time, and it   s like  anything else. If you have to call the vet up, it costs you a lot of money,  so you learn to do a lot of your own vetting yourself. You take care of  the animals in any way that you can whether it   s calves or goats. If you  think pulling calves is hard, you ought to try to pull a few goats.  I can only imagine. (Laughter) Any other livestock on the farm?  No, that is really the only livestock that we have on the farm now. Well,  my wife does have the miniature horses as a hobby that she really  enjoys. She just got into that in the last few years because, like I say, she  had been riding horses all of her life and been around horses and had  them. We got to the point we weren   t riding them and using them as  much, but we do have some minis out here that make great pets. She   s  got one of them that   s broke to pull a cart now. It   s a great lot of fun.  What are some new structures on the farm since it   s been in your hands?  Since we   ve been here, the new structures are the houses that we   re  living in. We have one garage up there at the other house. We do have a  barn up there, that   s a thirty by forty barn that was originally built for  livestock use, as far as stalling horses in and show calves and that type  of stuff when my son was going through school. We still currently use it  for horse stalls and goat stalls and put a little bit of hay in it and park  vehicles in it if the hail storm   s coming. Basically, those are the only  new structures that we have on the place.  Have mineral rights ever been a factor?  There are a little bit of mineral rights that, as far as the family, we do  23  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  own on the place, but not a lot. There were some wells that were drilled  on here, years ago. One of the wells is within a hundred yards of where  we   re sitting now. Those wells were all dry holes, capped off, and  nothing done with them. That was the only mineral that was ever done  on it.  Do you remember them coming by when you were a little girl with the  mineral rights, trying to drill?  Yes. Well, I think I was still here when they drilled one up on Waneta   s  farm.  Yes, on the other place up there, there was one drilled just right out here.  Next to the road.  There was one right out here and then there was one south of where our  house is, up there. But none of those came to play with anything that  was any good. There were a lot of wells around the area. Originally, this  was an oil boom area. In some of the history that I   ve read about, one of  the largest wells in the area was between here and Meramec, which is  less than a mile, on part of the old Adler farm, wasn   t it?  Yes.  Part of the Adler farm, one of the biggest wells in the area.  Well, you   re doing a lot with the farm now. When it came into your  hands in    97, did you intend for it to be that you   d work another job and  then just run the farm, or were you really intending to come back and  work the land?  Well, at that time, I can   t say that I truly intended to come back and try  to work the land. It   s something that from the first time I was a little kid  up on the farm, digging in the dirt with your hands and you get it  underneath your skin just a little bit, it   s kind of a part of you, and you  enjoy that type of stuff. It   s a totally different way of life compared to  working out for a big company or something like that. It is a different  type of life that you have to live. It can be stressful at times, but it   s not  nearly as stressful as working for big corporations. You could take one  and grow it to whatever point you wanted to. Like you say, when you  talk about making it bigger, it depends on how far apart a person wants  to go and how deep in debt you want to be.  I want to know from both of you a couple of your favorite farm  memories, holidays, a particular holiday, something that just really  24  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  comes to mind, a favorite farm memory.  Well, holidays were always spent at the farm, and Mother   s family and  Dad   s family     Everybody always came to the farm for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  We were all right down there, in the old house. It was always something.  I guess one of my fondest memories of coming to the farm would  probably be before I ever lived up here, whenever I was still young and  lived in Tulsa. My father was an avid bird hunter and loved to bird hunt  and every year, we would get to come to the farm and go bird hunting.  And I mean, we came up here and we    That was before Thanksgiving  and around Thanksgiving holiday. It was something where we got to  come up here and spend a lot of time on the farm and bird hunt. Before I  was old enough to even carry a gun and hunt, I went with them anyway.  They might have to pack me back and carry me home, but I went and we  went all day long. (Laughter)  Evelyn, do you have a fond memory?  Well, we went out and hunted for a cedar tree and cut a cedar tree down  to decorate for Christmas. I can remember us doing that. All the cousins  were here and it was just a great time. As far as anything really  outstanding, at the very moment, I can   t think of something.  Have you, Evelyn, remained your entire life here in Oklahoma?  Yes.  And why did you stay in Oklahoma?  Well, my first job, I worked in Pawnee for a doctor and he built a  hospital, just his, and I worked for him at the hospital. Then I met my  husband-to-be and he worked for the highway department. We were  transferred suddenly   they moved the whole department to Stillwater.  So, then on the spur of the moment, we moved to Stillwater and he  worked with the highway department until he retired. I worked at a  printing company, doing their office work. When he retired, he wanted  me to quit work, so I did.  He wanted to see if Dad would give us enough acreage to move and  have a house out here, on the farm. He liked to fish, and so we contacted  Daddy, or we came up here. I think everybody was here that day, and  talked to Daddy about it. He said,    Oh, that is fine.    So Bill, my  husband, we walked around and we chose the place where Allen is  living now. We moved up here in the first part of    84, but we bought a  25  Fulton  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  mobile home. It was just a singlewide then and we lived there and then  he passed away in    89. I lived there alone and, more or less, took care of  Dad because I could see his lights on from my house.  Then I got married again. At that time, I moved back to Stillwater. He   Allen  lost his Dad in October of last year, suddenly. And I lost my  husband in Stillwater, in March of this year, and so I   ve never had a  reason to move out of the state, or almost the county. (Laughs) Allen  called me not too long after that and he said,    You don   t have any family  in Stillwater,    and if I fell or had problems they would have to drive  down real quick and take care of me. He said,    We want you to move  back on the farm.    I said,    Well, let me think about it.    What was it, the  next morning I called you?  Yes.  I said,    Okay, I   m ready to move     (Laughter) So, I moved back. Well,  in the meantime, they had to buy a doublewide because my singlewide  wasn   t wide enough for them. So, he helped me do all the looking  around and taking care of finding a mobile home I liked. He   s done all  the outside work to get me settled here, and he   s still    After it turned  cold, he   s going back now to finish up my outside work. I had no reason  to move out of the state. (Laughs) That   s why we couldn   t come last  year when we were called to do this.  Well, what do you like so much about Oklahoma?  Well, like I say, I   ve never lived anywhere else. But I just love the farm.  It   s just carefree, and you kind of do what you want to when you want,  you know. And I don   t have children, except I have adopted. (Laughs)  I   m their godmother from when his sister and him were born. I claim  them and they   re the children I would have wanted to have children just  like. They   re super, and their son is too. He   s just great. That   s why I  like it.  Well Allen, you probably could have gone anywhere. Why did you stay  in Oklahoma?  Family roots, I guess. It   s always been home. Like I say, it was  something that my grandfather instilled in me, is the land. The land is a  part of your life. We say we own this, we don   t own this. We   re just  renting it and taking care of it. It belongs to God and it   ll all go back to  God one of these days, but right now, we   re the caretakers of it and we  try to take care of it the best way we can. It   s something that we enjoy  doing. It   s kind of like driving up there, out in the middle of a herd of  cattle. You get out there, they make a lot of noise, it   s hard to hear, but  26  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  every one of them is glad to see you. It   s not like driving into an office  and picking up a phone and everybody   s mad and got something to gripe  about. They   re always happy to see you when you show up, so it   s just  the fact that this is a place we call home, and it   s a part of our life, and  it   s near and dear to our heart.  Well, what do you see in the future of the farm in the next hundred  years? What do you see happening?  Well, hopefully, hopefully our son will continue on. When this farm  received its centennial status from the state, my grandfather was still  alive. When we went up there, he was in a wheelchair. We took him up  there to receive the award for it and all the centennial stuff. At that time,  my aunt owned the farm, and when we went up there, she went with him  and I went with him and my son went with him. My grandfather stated,  at that time, that this was the next four generations that would have this  farm, and hopefully that   s what happens. Hopefully, my son will want to  continue on, taking care of the land. Now, whether or not he   ll ever get  to the point that the land will be enough and the other outside stuff  around will be enough that he can make a living at it, I don   t know. If  you   d asked me ten years ago if I would be back to basically just  farming, I would   ve told you there wasn   t any way. It   s just not possible,  because it is a hard way to make a living, but it   s something that we  truly enjoy. They told me a long time ago, they said,    If you   ll figure out  something that you enjoy working at, you   ll never work a day in your  life.    I hate to say that we never work a day in our life, because I   m  awful tired every once in a while. (Laughter)  Well, is there anything else you   d like to add before we close today?  Anything else you   d like to tell us?  I think I   ve probably done too much talking anyway. (Laughter) Allen,  you   ve done such a great job. I should have had you go over these  papers and you give all this information. You did a lot better job with it  than I could.  You did great.  You both did great. We appreciate you sitting down with us and taking  time out of your busy schedule. Thank you very much.  So, when you were growing up, you need to tell me about the tractor.  Well, I already knew about the tractor because when Dad harvested and  put it through the thresher, well, it ran off the tractor on a long belt and I  sat on the tractor, so I could stop it real quick if Dad needed to, and I  27  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Kramer-Gambill  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  was not that young, then. But this big field out west of Allen   s house,  clear to the top of that hill, was plowed, and Dad would come out with  me and he would make the first round and show me where to go. And  that was the longest day. I plowed that when it was time to plow it. I  rode on the first old binder. Dad had someone driving a tractor and he  sat on the binder. I really didn   t drive the tractor then, but I would go to  the field with him and there was a little platform and I rode on that  platform hanging on to Dad. I just went because I liked it.  You were about eleven years old, you said?  Well, I was eleven when I ran the tractor and plowed. I was younger  when I rode on the tractor with Dad.  And when you were eleven, why were you helping out a little more?  Because he couldn   t find help then. There was just no     What was going on?  Well, it was the time of the war, I think, and there weren   t people. It was  fun for a little while. (Laughs) But I always went out with Dad on  weekends or something when he was cutting down wood for burning  wood in the winter.  What year were you born again?     31. October of    31.  So, you were born right around the Great Depression?  Yes, but I really don   t remember that much about it.  So Allen, I want you to tell me about the first time you drove a tractor.  One of the first times   I don   t know if it was the first time   I rode on  the tractor fender for years, just going out with my grandfather, whether  we were cutting hay or plowing fields. When I got big enough that I  could actually push the pedals in and operate the tractor, my grandfather  had always told me,    The first thing you do is you make sure you drive  through the center of the gate. No matter what, you get that tractor over  and you drive through the center of the gate so you don   t tear anything  up.    Well, he forgot to add into that, that if the sickle mower was on it  and it was sticking out on that one side, that you needed to get over,  because he pulled up to a wire gate one day and I thought I was sure big  enough to drive the tractor through the center of the gate. So, I just  28  Nykolaiszyn  Fulton  Nykolaiszyn  jumped down in the seat. He opened the gate up and motioned for me to  come through and I just cut the fencepost off. (Laughter) Just broke it  off. So, we spent the rest of the day fixing fence. I got to learn a lot  about fixing fence on that same day, too. But that was one of my fun  recollections of learning to drive a tractor, one of the first times I did  drive a tractor.  You never got into any mischief on the farm did you?  Never, never. (Laughter) My grandfather was somebody that I always  looked up to. I had this one time, one time, that I had this bad outlook, I  guess I could say, of my grandfather because I always thought my  grandfather was one of those that no matter what I did, he would stand  up for me and be behind me 100 percent. I was in the house, and I don   t  remember how old I was. I was really young, but I was up here spending  some time up here. I don   t remember what I did to make my Grandma  Maudie mad, but I made her very mad, and she come after me and was  chasing me out of the house.  My grandfather was out in the old machine shed working on something  out there. He wasn   t grinding feed, because there wasn   t a tractor out  there, but he was working out in the machine shed. I can remember  Grandma slowing down just long enough to get a peach branch switch  off the peach tree. And I wasn   t sure, but I was pretty sure that if she  caught me it was going to be a painful experience. So, she was chasing  me and I was doing pretty good outrunning her. She didn   t move very  fast, but she was chasing me around that machine shop and I just kept  hollering at the top of my lungs for Grandpa to help me,    Come help  me  Come help me     and I   d run by that door.  I knew he was in there, I could see him. But I just had to keep running, I  couldn   t stop. After about the third or fourth time of going around the  machine shed, he just stepped out and caught me. And I thought,    Boy,  I   m safe now,    and then he just handed me to Grandma and turned  around and walked off. (Laughter) So, I got the other end of that peach  tree switch and got to spend the rest of the day sitting in the house. I  don   t know whether that was a memorable experience or what you  would call that, but it was definitely an experience. (Laughter)   Well, again, we thank both of you for sharing your farm memories with  us today.   -------  -------
