 Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the OSU Library, and also joining  me today is Tanya Finchum. Today is Wednesday, March 10, 2010.  We   re interviewing Jim Kinder, Ann Kinder and Pam Kalka with the Jim  and Ann Kinder Farm in Carney, Oklahoma. This interview is part of  the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral History Project. Thank  you for joining us today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Tell us a little bit about how your family came to Oklahoma.  They lived in the southwest part of Missouri, and their land flooded in  the rainy season. They needed to get out of the flooding areas so they  hunted the highest place in Oklahoma, which is a divide here. So that   s  why they settled in this area.  And they came for the Land Run?  My grandfather did. We are halfway between the Cimarron and the  Deep Fork River, and actually, the water where we   re living here in this  house, this water runs to the Cimarron (gestures to the west), this water  runs to the Deep Fork (gestures to the east).  So they were really thinking about water when they settled?  Yes. They hated lowlands so that   s why they settled in this area.  5  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  They could   ve settled next to the river. (Laughs)  The poorest hills in Oklahoma.  What were their professions before moving to Oklahoma?  They farmed, and my grandpa traded horses.  Do you know any details of the original farm? Any original structures?  Yes.  The old house site, the old barn site was there when I was a kid. They  had quit using them. The barn was in bad repair, fell in. The house fell  in. I was very interested in getting started in the  bull dozer business so I  dug a hole and buried all of it. There was a cellar there that was very  interesting, that my grandmother used. Some of her old bottles were  there, jars that she would can, and she would store the jars in the cellar.  They were still there.  When they settled the land, what was the first structure they built?  A log house, sixteen by eighteen.  And how many people were in the family back then?  The parents and three children. They built that in 1892, and then in  1900, they built a frame house. That was a log house. Then they built a  frame house and it was sixteen by twenty-six.  I thought it was very interesting   the boys all slept in the barn.  But it was later because they had several children, and later the house  was full, and so the older boys had to sleep out in the barn.  I just thought that was interesting.  Must   ve been cold out there.  Sure enough.  There you go. (Laughter)  Now, one of the oldest boys was granddad, right?  Yes.  6  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Was he the oldest      No.  Well, he was your dad, my granddad.  Yes, my dad.  One of the boys that slept in the barn. So when his mama said,    What?  Were you born in a barn?    He really was. (Laughter)    Close that door      They also had a log stable, a hen house, a corn crib, and the cave that he  was telling you about, the cellar, and they had a well. They had an  orchard, and they had fifty or sixty acres that was fenced, between forty-five  and sixty that was cultivated.  What type of crops and livestock?  A lot of kaffir corn, for some reason. I don   t know about the cows. They  had milk cows, is the only thing I really know, but my grandpa was a big  horse trader. They had lots of horses. And so I know more about the  horse trading than I do about the farming.  And what did he do on Saturday afternoons, you told me a while ago?  Oh, he raced horses. He had a race horse, and it was a good one. I mean,  he won, supposedly, the race at Tryon. They would race at Tryon every  Saturday, and then he went to the county fair and won the county.  But, no gambling.  No gambling, no, no. (Laughter) No drinking, except moonshine.  Because that didn   t really count. (Laughter) Did you all talk about him  leaving the wife and kids for a week or so to go trade his horses?  No, no, but      He   d gather horses and      Yes, and then he would take them back to Missouri, where they came  from, and stay gone until he had the horses all gone, except one to ride  home.  Really?  7  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Yes, then he   d come back here and gather them up.  And then he   d take a whole string of them and go.     and go again.  So that   s one way you were able to bring in some income into the family.  Yes.  What were some other ways? With the crops, how would they get to  market? Where would they go?  They would feed what they grew at that time to their cattle. Kaffir corn  was grain. They would milk, and they could sell cream at that time. I  never heard a word about chickens, but I   m sure they had chickens.  Well, they had a hen house so I hope they had chickens in it. (Laughter)  Yes. And some of this stuff was before my time so      Sure.  So when they sold the cream, it was in town or neighbors would come  by for it?  No, they   d take it to town.  Up to Tryon?  Yes, to Tryon.  And then too, the train came through Tryon at that time, and you had     Right, it did.      a couple of  cotton  gins.  Yes, they did. That was something else, they did raise cotton, I forgot.  And they could sell it.  Did they pick it themselves or did they have outside help?  They picked it their selves.  8  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  That   s hard work.  That   s how come they had so many kids. (Laughter)    We need more  labor     (Laughter) Got to do what you   ve got to do. Did you ever pick  cotton?  A little bit.  Did you?  Yes.  And you said,    That wasn   t for me.     No   That   s hard.  I know it  It   s backbreaking.  I   ve never done it. I   ve always just heard it   s hard, and it hurts your  hands.  It is.  Have you ever done it?  No.  Okay, I don   t recommend it. (Laughter)  And you picked some cotton too, didn   t you?  Yes      Handpicked it?  Yes, but I lived further east from here. I lived about four or five miles  east.  It still counts as cotton.  Well     (Laughter)  Cotton picking is     9  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  I just meant I wasn   t around here at the time.  So what happened to the farm? You have the three boys, a lot of kids     Yes.  Tell me about the evolution of the farm.  The youngest son ended up buying the farm   William Kinder   s son,  who was my uncle Ralph. And he had it for years and years and years,  and then we bought it.  You and Mom?  Yes.  It   s only changed hands a couple of times?  Right. That   s all.  Wow.  And, something real interesting about the old farm, the mark stone is  still in the corner of the property from when it was the original survey.  When the surveyors came out and marked it?  Yes.  They used rock?  Yes.  They used a big old rock?  Yes, and put a mark in it, and I know where it   s at.  So once the farm came into the next generation   s possession, tell me  about the operations. What was going on there before you got it?  My uncle, that bought the farm from my grandpa, didn   t do anything  with it. He just let it sit there, mainly. He lived in California, actually.  Grew quite a cedar crop. (Laughs)  Oh yeah, grew a lot of healthy cedars. (Laughter)  10  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A lot of red cedars. (Laughs) It got pretty overgrown.  Wow. So it was just sitting there?  Yes. Rent, he would lease it to someone to run cattle, and then we  leased it, and that   s when we ended up buying it.  So tell me about the property today.  We   ve done a lot of conservation on it; taken off lots and lots of cedars,  put a nice pond on it, which it didn   t have. It did have a spring from day  one. Mainly we run cattle on it. It does grow lots of grass. When they  did raise cotton and feed on it, they did not protect the land from eroding  and washing. We   ve fixed the erosions on it.  Put in some terraces.  Terraced it and like today, we   ve got it all in grass now.  And what year did you purchase that farm?  (Laughs) Well, that   s a tricky question. It was about    82,    84,  somewhere in there, I would say.  I would say around    80, yes. Early    80s.  I was in high school.  We owned the dozer service. We have sold some shale off of the place  to build roads and locations and stuff.  All the red dirt that Mom griped about when we were kids actually  became valuable in the oil field at one point.  That   s true.  It   s real compactable. It   s excellent.  It   s been real good to us, with the shale pit.  And how did you discover that?  Well, it   s just an old poor, rocky hill, and the oil field needed some lease  roads built, and the engineer that worked for the oil field asked me if I  knew where he could get some rocky dirt. I said,    Absolutely.     (Laughter) And so we went over and started digging on it a little bit. He  11  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  said,    Well, I believe that   ll work.    I said,    I do, too,    so we were in  business. (Laughter) Actually we had to buy that in the late    70s,  because this was the early    80s when this started. I remember that, so  that   s how it came into being.  Let   s get back to your father, because your father grew up on the  original farm.  Yes.  What did he end up doing?  Farming.  In Oklahoma?  Yes, yes.  Whereabouts?  Just about three-quarters   it corners this right here, but about a mile.  Within a couple of miles of the homestead.  When you were growing up, you probably had lots of chores to do.  Absolutely.  What type of chores did you do?  We milked cows by hand. We had to cut the ice when it froze in the  winter time. Had to carry in water to the house, and that was part of my  chores after school, was to keep fresh water in the water bucket.  And Jim being the way he is, when he cuts the ice, he goes ahead and  slides into the pond. Now, we   re just lucky he   s here. How they got him  back up through that hole in the pond, through the ice, I don   t know.  Yes, that was one of my childhood experiences. My dad broke his arm  when I was a little kid. I was probably seven or eight years old. At that  particular time he broke both bones in his arm so instead of setting the  bones, at that time, he was in the hospital for six weeks. We had a winter  about like this past winter. My mother and I milked approximately   I  couldn   t tell you, but probably ten cows by hand. We would get up and  I   d help her milk cows before I went to school. Then, in the evening, it  was my job to go over and cut the ice, and she   d usually go with me, but  12  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  I was always in a hurry. I wanted to get over there and get it done. What  happened in the ice, I decided I could just kick the ice and it busted  instead. That day it wasn   t frozen very thick so I was kicking it and for  some reason, my other foot slipped and I kind of went under the ice a  little, and it   s a quarter of a mile from the house. That   s cold. (Laughter)  So you got yourself out? You were by yourself that trip?  Yes. Well, Granny was coming   my mother, I called her Granny   she  was coming but I was out before she got there so I didn   t worry her a  whole lot. (Laughter) But that was part of my early childhood, I  remember. And my dad grew up in hard times. When it rained, we did  not get the car out of the garage. We did have a car. I don   t know how  they operated without a pickup or a truck, but we had a car. But we  didn   t get it out of the garage if it rained. So if any school activities went  on, I walked to the school activities down the railroad.  I was in the third grade, and we had a special program one night, and I  needed to be in it. And I went by myself that particular time. I went  before dark to the school, but it got dark, and there   s one place you come  through the old railroad and there   s a cut there. You never heard the kind  of noises I heard in my life. (Laughter) I could still hear them. It was  unreal some of the things you could hear, and you could make pretty  good time getting home that way. (Laughter) But we had to walk if we  went anywhere when it rained. I mean the roads are bad now, but then     we could   ve probably got out, but my dad just wouldn   t do it. He just  wasn   t going to get his car dirty.  What type of car did he have?  Well, the first one I remember, that   s another story. It was a    38 Ford  four-door, but it had    One of the first memories I have when I was a  little kid. I was probably five years old  and  we had to haul ice. We  didn   t have electricity so we   d go to town and get ice, and it rotted the  floor out in that car between the seats where they hauled the ice. I was  sitting in that back seat one time and I thought,    Doggone, I   m going to  fall right out of that hole     (Laughter)  Had a little Flintstone thing going on.  Of course, it was probably a hole that big, but you could see through it. I  can remember that real well too, that it was really scary. I thought,    I   ll  just fall out of there.     Didn   t the Flintstone   s have a car like that?  13  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Oh, yes  (Laughter) Grandpa wasn   t much of a driver anyway. He didn   t  drive well. He didn   t drive often, but he didn   t drive well. But Dad   I  don   t remember this happening, I just remember the story   Dad did a  lot of contract farming when I was real, real little, or maybe just before,  and Grandpa was doing some farming for him, helping him out. Dad  needed somebody to come and rake hay that he   d cut. He took my  grandpa over with him, and he put him on the tractor, got him started.  And he started around the field with that hay rake and it was kind of  rough and came off of the hitch, is that right?  Yes, the pin bounced out.  The hay rake came apart from the tractor. My granddad never looked  back. He just kept going around a big old field, and so he was making a  big old circle. Well, Dad was on the other side just waving at him, and  Grandpa just waved back and kept going  (Laughter)  He just kept going, yes.  When he got around to that rake I guess is when he finally discovered  he   d missed it.  He went all the way around.  He stopped and hooked on the rake.  He was as hard of hearing as I am      And maybe even more hard-headed.      and the noise of the rake didn   t bother him so    (Laughter)  Do you recall the first time you ever drove a tractor?  There   s another story.  Oh, pretty close, pretty close. I was pretty small. Actually, I can  remember trading the horses for the first tractor. I was probably too  small to be driving. I was probably eight years old, maybe ten. I don   t  remember the actual age, but the railroad ran through our property so we  were going to go over and work the field after a rain. The way that you   d  come around into the road coming up the hill and then you   d turn across  the railroad. Well, I rode over there with my dad, and he was going to  look at something else   it was too wet to work. So he was going to walk  on up the field and look at something else so I said,    Can I drive the  tractor, Dad?       Well, yes.    That   s the first time I remember ever driving  14  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  it by myself. So here I go. I start up this hill. Well, the tractor   s governor  opens if you start up the hill, especially if you   re in a little bit too high of  a gear. I made it fine, that wasn   t the big problem. I turned across the  railroad and there was a train. And I was too little to really reach the  clutch and too scared, so   I did have enough sense to turn the wheel and  drive off of the bank there and got the tractor stuck. I did kind of get in  trouble for getting the tractor stuck. (Laughter) It wasn   t missing the  train, it was getting the tractor stuck that I got in trouble for. But it didn   t  hit me. And my mother was at the house, she thought it probably hit me.  She saw it happening. That was kind of a scary experience.  Well, I   ve got to say you   ve improved a little bit since then.  Not much, but a little bit. (Laughter)  It   s still a little iffy. When we see him on the tractor, we get a little  nervous.  Going back to gathering ice as a little boy, you said you kicked it, but  what if it was too thick? How would you gather the ice?  We   d take an ax and cut a hole for the cows to drink in the pond. That  was a lot better than carrying it and pumping it from the pump. Ten  cows drink a lot of water.  They didn   t actually gather the ice. They just cut a hole in it.  No, we   d just cut a hole in it so the     The ice that they hauled in the car, they went to town for, to keep things  cold.  There used to be an icehouse at the grocery store, and you could buy ice  year-round.  To refrigerate your stuff?  Yes.  So growing up, did you have electricity right away?  No. (Laughter) I was a big old kid. I don   t know how old I was exactly.  Probably     I was twelve, and I think you probably got it the same time we did.  15  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Yes, so      Yes, so he was twelve or thirteen.  She   s a little older than I am. (Laughter) But that   s beside the point. I  was a big old kid when I      You might want to turn those cameras and things off because     (Laughter)  Family violence is frowned on in the video. (Laughter)  You will be able to edit it. (Laughter)  Oh, okay. Okay. (Laughter)  But I was a big kid, and we had an outhouse at that time. I remember  getting electricity, and the guy that came and wired our house was the  tallest, skinniest man I   ve probably ever seen in my life. The old attic in  the old house, we didn   t have that much room in it, but he   d get up there  and crawl and run those wires back. I don   t know how he did it, but they  got it wired. Had two lights upstairs and one light in each room and tried  to get a plug-in in every room at that time. So then, we got to build a  bathroom onto the house. First bath I ever had in my life. (Laughter)  And was it the last?  Just about.  Before that, surely your mother made you jump in what number tub?  Oh, I don   t   what is it? Big old   actually, we had a double tub.  Oh?  I don   t know what number it was, but it was a double tub that we   d get  in. And there was something else    See, I was kind of a happen-along.  My older brother was quite a bit older than me. Actually, my youngest  older brother was ten years older than me, but my brother older than him  was two or three years older than him. First bath I probably ever  remember taking I was about four or five years old then, but I   d  probably had one or two before that     (Laughter)  I would think. (Laughter)     but anyhow, my dadgum older brother brought the itch home     16  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Aren   t you sorry that you asked?     from somewhere, and they put something in that bathwater   when  you   d take a bath, it would just burn you up, but it got rid of the itch.  But, it would hurt you.  So that was memorable.  Absolutely  We would take a bath in the kitchen. We   d heat water on the  stove and then put it in the tub, and everybody would take a bath in the  same water. I was usually lucky enough to get to be first.  How   d you get the honor?  I was the littlest. I   d scream the loudest.  And everybody else was grown.  Yes.  All the brothers and sisters were gone.  How many siblings did you have?  Two brothers and two sisters.  During this whole time, would you ever go see Grandpa and Grandma?  Yes. Well, my grandpa moved to Chandler about the time I can  remember, and we   d go once a month to go see him, probably. He was  old then. If you want to hear something about him, I always remember  he had a little old pistol, and I always wanted that little old pistol, but I  never did get it. He had a little pistol he carried all the time. He was a  good shot with it. It was a .22 pistol, single shot. He always carried it.  He   d probably get in a little trouble now. (Laughter) He always didn   t  like rules any better than I did.  Well, did you get the pistol?  No, I didn   t. No, I got to shoot it when we   d go see him in Chandler.  We   d shoot down     Do you know where it ended up?  I really don   t know. I know where the family Bible is but I don   t know  17  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  where the pistol went.  What about your grandma? What do you remember about her?  She died before I can remember, really.  She was the one who was 100 percent Indian?  Yes.  Hundred percent.  Hundred percent. Every bit of her. (Laughter)  She really was      She   s where we got our nose.  She was a Cherokee Indian. The Indians disowned her when she married  my grandpa. Of course, I don   t think the white people liked her real well  either.  They kind of left her out in the cold.  How did they meet?  I really don   t know. Do you remember?  I always tell people that he won her in a horse race just because it sounds  really cool, but I don   t think it happened. (Laughter)  Didn   t she come from El Dorado, Kansas? And I wouldn   t doubt that he  wasn   t up there trading horses and met her there, I imagine. But I don   t  know that.  I like the horse race story a lot better myself.  But, he was really quite a horse trader. I mean, he traded lots and lots,  and he really did have some good race horses.  It seems very lucrative for that time.  Yes.  Well, you could probably get in a lot of trouble, also. (Laughter)  18  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  Yes. He was a real cowboy, supposedly. I have no proof of it. He did  ride with Pistol Pete  Frank Eaton  for a while. They were buddies. I  have no reason to doubt it, but that was one of the stories I   ve been told,  that they were good buddies and they rode together a lot.  One of my favorite stories up at the old home place   have you all  already talked about Everett and Ide?  No.  No.  That   s one of my personal favorites. This would be my grandpa   s  brother and sister, right?  Yes.  Right.  One of the brothers was going to shoot his other brother and the sister  jumped between them at the last minute and he shot her arm off. The  time I met my aunt, she was already missing an arm. Just a little bit of  family violence there. I don   t know why I enjoy violence. (Laughter)  Can you imagine you, Mama, coming out? My mom used to say she was  going to yank my arm off and beat me with the bloody stump and I  figured      Oh, Pam      I figured whenever she came out of the house and saw what Everett  had done to Ide she probably wanted to. (Laughter)  That must   ve been one family argument   You know it. Ide was about seven years old or so?  Yes.  How old were the boys?  Who was he trying to shoot? Which one of the brothers?  I don   t remember. I think Tom, but I   m not sure. I   m not positive of that.  I   ve never met Uncle Everett. I   ve always suspected that his mother beat  him to death, but I don   t know. (Laughter)  19  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  He lived in California.  That   s what you all always told me. (Laughter) Sorry, that was a little  off the subject.  These are some pretty wild stories, huh?  That   s great.  That   s what you wanted, wasn   t it?  I want to get back to before electricity came, how did they heat the  house?  Wood. Well, we heated with wood and cooked with wood when I first  remember, and then shoot, we were some of the people who got butane.  It wasn   t propane. You had to bury it, because it would freeze if you  didn   t put it below the top of the ground. And so we dug the biggest old  pit out there in the front yard and put a butane tank   it   s still there  actually. It   s full of water.  Did you dig it by hand? Did you just shovel dig it?  Yes. Oh, yes. There wasn   t a backhoe then. (Laughter)  Just checking.  But, dug it with a shovel and buried the butane line approximately three  feet deep all the way around the house. When we got that, we got a  butane stove to heat the house and a butane stove to cook with and a  butane icebox, so we were really uptown, and that was before electricity,  quite a bit.  The place that he grew up on is about ten years or so away from the  centennial time. His mom and dad owned that place, and then we bought  it from them. I know that Dad had it before 1923   I haven   t looked up  the records on it, but they got married in    23, and Dad already had it and  had been living there a while. And I   m not really sure just when he got  the farm. But we   re nearly a hundred years on that one.  When was World War I over?  Is this a trick question?  Yes.  20  Kalka  Finchum  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  A, Kinder  Finchum  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  I came unprepared.  Sometime in the early    20s     It is the early    20s, but I don   t know     But, he was in the war and came home and bought the place. Or did he  have it before he went?  Yes, he had the place already.  Okay. Alright. But that had some bearing on the time.  Was the original property 160 acres?  Yes.  Are we talking about the Centennial one now?  Yes.  Yes, it was 160 acres, and there   s 120 of it now. We   re hoping to get the  other sixty  forty  back again. But we   ve got the property out around it  so we   ve got a lot of that. We don   t have that sixty  forty  right there  though.  We actually had the full 160. To make a long story short, we got broke,  and had a chance to sell forty of it so that   s why it   s not in there now.  We   d like to get it back, but I don   t know if we can or not.  Well, it seems to go in cycles. Just a matter of time.  Yes, but poor people have poor ways.  We should know. (Laughter)  Well, that   s what I meant.  Whenever I was born, at Grandma and Grandpa   s house, Dad   s dad and  mom still had an outhouse. They had put indoor plumbing in by then but  they still had an outhouse, and we were fascinated to get to go outside at  an outhouse. Can you even imagine? (Laughter) I don   t know why we  thought that was marvelous, but we did. And you could hand-pump your  water. They still had the old hand pump.  Did they still keep a catalog out there, for old time   s sake?  21  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  Sears-Roebuck. (Laughter) Absolutely, absolutely.  Jim   s grandma and grandpa are buried a mile north and about a mile and  a half east?  Or west?  West.  Do you know 105 and 177? The intersection?  Four Corners?  Yes, Four Corners.  Yes. Just a quarter of a mile east on the north side there   s a cemetery  there where they   re buried.  The story that Pam likes so well about the aunt that lost her arm   they  buried her arm out there on the top of the grave.  Actually, that   s my great-grandparents.  That   s the great-grandpa.  And my grandparents are at Carney.  Oh  I thought they   Sorry. (Laughter)  It   s still funny that they buried the arm. It cracks me up.  They did bury her arm there with my great-grandparents.  I don   t know why I find that story so funny. Growing up with a brother  and sisters, I think just the arguing back and forth, I still can   t imagine  grabbing a gun and think,    I   m going to shoot my brother     It   s funny.  Did your dad end up going to school at all?  No. As far as I know   he might   ve, because he knew how to read and  write, but I don   t know anything about his education, really. As far as I  know, those kids went maybe to the eighth grade, and I think he did. I  believe they all did, but after that I think that was it.  When you started going to school, what was the name of your school?  22  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  I went to Carney.  And at that time, how big was it?  There was, like, fifteen kids in my class and there were all twelve grades  at Carney at that time. We were an average class, so whatever fifteen  times twelve would be real close. I don   t know exactly. But, there was  two rooms total for the high school   that was in the upstairs of the old  schoolhouse. There were four rooms downstairs where we went to  school. And that was the total of the schoolhouse. The old schoolhouse  did have a fire escape so all kids loved to play in the fire escape from  one of the rooms upstairs. We were not allowed to go upstairs so we   d  climb the fire escape backwards and slide back down. (Laughter) That  was our entertainment.  Until they got caught.  It was before slides. (Laughter) Now, did your older brothers and sisters  start over here at the Red Mound school?  Yes. Pam lives a mile west from right here. There was a Red Mound  school right there and that   s where all my brothers and sisters started  school. Actually, got all the schooling    No, one of them graduated.  Yes, he went to Carney to graduate.  Yes, yes.  But that   s where they all started. Was it like a one-room type  schoolhouse or what was it?  It was a one-room school, yes.  You mentioned on the old, old home place   the original 160   that you  got interested in bulldozing, and you bulldozed a couple of the buildings  down     Yes.  How did you get interested in bulldozing?  Well, the old banker at Tryon was my grandfather   s banker. We were  just friends until I go in here and he was going to repossess a bulldozer.  And I was what, nineteen or twenty years old? He said,    You really  ought to go buy that bulldozer.    I said,    I don   t have any money.    He  said,    Well, I will finance it for you. You just go get it, tell the guy  23  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  you   ll buy it, make a deal for it.    I didn   t know what I was looking for     I never drove a bulldozer before in my life. So I go look at it. He showed  me how to start it, how to drive it. I didn   t know what to look at on the  wear points. It was in Tryon so I went ahead and bought the silly thing,  but I couldn   t drive it home. You had to back it because the tracks would  stay on going backwards, but they was so worn out they would run off  the dozer going forward. (Laughter) This is what got me into bulldozing.  But, it was fun. You   d run it maybe an hour and work on it two or three  days to make it run again. But, it was a great education. I mean, it   s  probably equivalent to a four-year college course, I would say.  (Laughter) It was really an exciting time, but it got me started. And, this  was about the time we got married. Actually, the assistant banker, he  was a cashier at the bank, he gave me a job to do on the way home so I  could buy fuel and have enough money to get the dozer home. And so  that   s how we got started in that.  I   m jumping ahead, but you mentioned it. I have to know how you met  your wife. Now you   re on the spot.  Oh, well, would you believe at a drive-in movie theater?  Where? In Carney?  Cushing, Oklahoma.  What were you doing in Cushing?  Oh, that was a drive-in that we could get in the trunk of the car and     Jim  My goodness, the tales he tells  (Laughter)  Actually, this other friend of mine said one night,    Let   s go to the  movies.    That was the closest movie around, and you could probably get  in for like fifty cents. We probably had a dollar between us. I think there  was three of us went to the movies. She had money. She had a car and  had a carload of kids with her. (Laughter) I think they snuck into the  show, but that   s beside the point, but that   s where I met her.  He   s kidding about the money. (Laughter) I did have a car.  You had a job.  Yes.  You had an off-farm job.  24  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Yes, she had an off-farm job.     which was a big deal.  I graduated at Agra. It   s actually about four or five miles straight  through the country there to where I grew up, but I didn   t meet Jim until  we were grown.  I knew her uncle, in fact, two or three of her uncles, but we   d never met.  I didn   t know her family, but we met at that drive-in.  You were raised on a farm?  Yes.  And how did you get an off-farm job? What did you do?  I kept books for a furniture company, and I did whatever they needed me  to do at the store, actually. But mostly I kept the books, and I waited on  customers if the other people were busy and that kind of thing.  And that was in Cushing?  Actually, that was in Chandler.  See, at that time kids would stay at home until the parents run them off  or they got married. (Laughter)  Actually, I had already been to school. I went to nurses training at Enid  but then I kind of got hurt at lifting patients, and I came home to  recuperate. I needed money, and so I had to find a job here at home and  so that   s how that came about. We did the same things that they did  growing up. We milked the cows and did the farming and the baling of  the hay and all that stuff.  When you were younger, what were holidays like? What did you do? Did  the whole family get together? Where would you go? Where would you  have the celebration?  Yes. We would have it at my parents    house. I can always remember  special times, especially Christmas or Fourth of July.  Easter.  And birthdays. Yes, always Easter. My brother and sister both lived in  Tulsa. They had family nearly as old as I was. They would always come  25  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  home, and there would be room for all of them to stay in that old three  bedroom house, but we   d just sleep on the floor or outside on the porch  or wherever, if it was summertime. And then my other sister lived over  here on the highway, actually. They were close. Then, one brother was  in California so he wouldn   t be here, but it was always a special  occasion. Everybody would get together when he   d come home and  have a good time.  Eat watermelon and fish out on that bench.  Yes, right. (Laughs)  Every family get-together we   d have homemade ice cream. That was  special.  And who would do the cooking?  My mother.  What would she cook?  Oh, everything.  Lot of times she would fry chicken. She could cook anything.  She could. She was an amazing cook.  She was a good cook.  Cooked everything in grease. Everything in grease.  And she measured things like this. This much salt in the palm of her  hand was a teaspoon and she   d do this (makes pinching gesture). Can  you imagine what all would happen if I tried that?  Well, I remember when Mom and Aunt Mary would ask her for recipes.     Well         She   d say            I don   t really know. Just come and watch     (Laughs)        put some in there and        Okay.  She just knew how to do it.  26  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  She raised chickens, and she   d go out and clean them. She   d catch them  herself and chop their head off, wring their neck then   actually, she   d  pull their head off.  See, there   s more family violence. (Laughter)  She would pull their head off?  Yes, after she wrung their neck. Yes, she   d kill them first. And then  she   d pluck them. She   d always tried to get us to help her, but she could  do it so much better. We didn   t want to mess them up. (Laughter)  Sure.  Did you ever clean a chicken?  No, but I   m fascinated. My coworker will tell you, I   m fascinated with  the stories of how people killed and     Did that sort of thing.  Yes.  Butchered a hog and skinned a chicken and     Oh yes, sure. I really am. She   s interviewing home demonstration  agents, and I   m like,    Go into detail.    (Laughter)  Well, on cleaning a chicken it was kind of interesting. She   d have hot  water and stick it in there and then pull the feathers. There   d always be  some pin feathers left so she   d just build a little fire and burn those pin  feathers off.  Yes, just singe them off. It really stinks when you   re pulling the feathers  off of a chicken. You put them in that hot water and those feathers do  stink.  She used to clean fish, and if there was a bit of meat left she wasn   t done  with that fish yet. (Laughs) If somebody ended up with a bone in their  fish that was their problem, but she wasn   t going to miss any meat off of  those fish. I   m the other way. I   d rather just filet and be done.  Would your family butcher your own meat?  Yes. That   s another story. We would have a gather. We would have it at  our place, to butcher hogs. My dad would always go cut some fresh trees  27  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  to make a hanger to hang the hogs with and set up some tubs and scald  the water. You   d kill the hog, and then you   d dip them in there and then  scrape it. It was quite an operation.  Did you use a tub or a barrel?  A barrel. Cut the top out of a barrel and then that was my mother   s job.  We had a smokehouse at our house. That   s where the separators sat, too.  We had a smokehouse, and we would salt cure our own meat when I was  a kid. I would help do that as a kid. It was always fun, get in there and  rub in that salt, unless you cut your hand. (Laughter)  And then it would hurt.  Yes, that   s right.  Did you ever smoke in the smokehouse?  No, no.  They just called it that?  They just called it smokehouse, right.  What separator? You said a separator   s in there, too.  It   s a milk sep     Yes, it separated cream from the milk.  She made her own butter?  Yes.  Did she?  And made her own cottage cheese. In fact there was a guy     I saw that face.  One of the guys from town   old Charlie Griggs, he   s dead now, but he  was my brother   s friend. He   d always wait on her to make cottage  cheese. He would walk out there from town to get to eat her homemade  cottage cheese. It was pretty neat. There   s something else we ate when  we were kids. It   s really a shame that we don   t have it anymore, but milk  sours now the way it   s treated. But, it didn   t go sour until it   s run  28  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  through a process. It will clabber and that   s how you make cottage  cheese. But, clabbered milk and cornbread and fresh onions is better  than a steak. (Laughter) And you can   t knock it if you haven   t tried it.  Right, I   m going to go ahead and knock it.  You can knock it if you   ve tried it.  It was choice eating. You get a little bit of the thick cream off the cream  and put on there with it. It was very, very tasty. Really.  Food is different today.  Oh, praise God. (Laughter)  But, I miss that clabbered milk and cornbread. Well, I eat cornbread and  buttermilk now. It   s nearly, but it   s not the same.  Any other favorite foods from back in the day?  Oh, ice cream was a     Not meatloaf.  No, not meatloaf.  I was so proud of the very first meal I made him after we got married.  He had eaten meatloaf at school. One of his teachers made him eat the  meatloaf at the lunchroom and it made him sick. Well, I hadn   t heard  that story, and so after we were married I made this meatloaf and it  turned out right, and I was so happy. He came in there, he looked at that  and he said,    I don   t eat meatloaf,    and he just walked away. (Laughter)  I thought,    Oh, what   ve I done?     You   re going to start over. (Laughing)  No, I couldn   t stand it. It was bad. And I wouldn   t eat bologna for years  and years. When I was, I think, a freshman in high school, we got to go  to Wilson Packing Plant in Oklahoma City, and they honestly handled  the bologna   that   s bologna, but bologna whatever   with wheelbarrows  and scoop shovels, and that   s no exaggeration so I couldn   t stand it.  You   d watch them wheeling that stuff around. It was nasty. But I eat  quite a bit of it anymore.  After high school, and you got your dozer, I assume, after high school,  what did you end up doing?  29  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Well, actually I went to college one year. I got my degree in a hurry.  (Laughter) OSU did me real well. They got me through in one year.  (Laughter) And they said that was enough for me. But that   s when I  bought the bulldozer. We bought this farm where this house is and built  this house. Actually, I moved twice in my lifetime. When we married,  we moved to town and lived on the wrong side of the railroad.  (Laughter) But, that   s where we lived until we built this house, and then  we moved here. That   s the extent of our moving. We bought a few cows.  Ann loved to milk so I got her a milk cow, and when she   d get pregnant,  she always insisted on doing the milking. (Laughter)  That   s not really how I remember it.  Something like that. But, we started raising beef cattle, and the dozer  business was terrible. I mean, you ought to try to make a living with a  dozer that you couldn   t drive forwards and the blade   s on the front end.  And, we didn   t have the truck   we didn   t have any tracks then.  No, we didn   t have a truck to move it on.  So we had to ride it wherever we went, and if you had to cross the  highway with it then I had to take tires and lay across the highway so he  could go across the highway on those tires so it didn   t cut the highway  or we   d have had to pay for the highway.  We really learned later, though, that you could just drive on across it.  It   d just barely mark it. It didn   t bother anybody. (Laughter)  As long as we didn   t get caught.  Never did get caught. (Laughter)     You go sit on that hill and watch         But, anyhow, we struggled with that. We baled hay in the summertime  and hauled hay. We   d do everything that was honest.  Bartered.  Yes, we done quite a bit of trade.  A lot of bartering.  And you worked in the oil field.  30  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Worked in the oil field. In fact, I worked in the oil field in the night  when we got the dozer      That   s right.     and I   d try to push dirt in the daytime with a wore-out bulldozer that I  was futilely working on. Never did get it paid for   maybe still yet.  (Laughter) But, we got a chance to buy a better dozer, we thought. I was  actually up at my sister   s and saw this dozer and thought we could  arrange financing and got it. We bought this really nice looking dozer,  really painted up good and brought it home and boy, it would work for a  day or two. Really worked good and it worked pretty good for a while,  but we got so far in trouble. We went bankrupt and didn   t have enough  sense to know it. And we just kept going     We did not file bankruptcy.     and we just kept digging holes and going deeper and deeper in. And  this was like in probably 1970   late    60s or    70s. We went backwards  over  10,000. That was all the money in the world, and I   m serious. We  owed fuel. We owed back payments. We owed property payments. We  owed   everything we owned, we owed payments on. We were about to  get repossessed. Everything but Ann and the kids was probably  mortgaged. (Laughter) But, anyhow, the old bulldozer that went  backwards  10,000 was worth about  3,500 at that time, seriously. How  do you get out of a hole like that with something that won   t run? And  you just got a hole. So when it would rain, I   d always go somewhere and  look to see if I couldn   t trade something or do something.  Got to Oklahoma City and I found the International Harvester dealer  there that said,    You know, we could probably finance you a new  bulldozer with your trade in if you can get it released from the bank.     That sounded real interesting because I had kind of learned to run a  bulldozer by then, and I think it was in 1968, wasn   t it? I   m pretty sure.  He actually had a bulldozer there that had a few hours on it that someone  had caught on fire. They were going to rebuild it, so I could save lots  and lots of money on it. A new bulldozer at that time was about  20,000.  So I thought,    Boy, if I could get that for  15,000, I could run that two-thousand  hours next year. That would get us caught up and make the  payments on this dozer.     I went to the old banker   he was still alive. He said,    Yes, you can do  that.    Said he   ll do it. We got the old dozer, released the mortgage on it.  Traded in on the new one that had been burned. It wasn   t brand new, it  had a few hours. But they rebuilt it real good. It was fixed up like brand  new. Nobody could even tell the difference. Not even me, looking at it.  31  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  So I ran that thing, and so help me, I ran it two thousand hours.  Got everything kind of caught back up?  Yes.  We could be at zero again.  That first year, I just sat in the seat of the bulldozer from daylight until  dark.  He   s not kidding.  How would you find work?  Oh, there was lots of work to do. I know a lot of people. I did then. I   ve  always been bashful, but I get acquainted with people around. I   d  worked farm work ever since I was a little bitty kid, ever since I was big  enough, so I knew all the farmers needed dozer work. We   d just go here  and there. Bought an old truck in the meantime. Ann always insisted on  driving it, too. (Laughter) I had it parked out here by the barn one time,  and it has a wench line on it. At that time there wasn   t no such thing as a  low-boy trailer. You had to lower the front of the trailer to load the  dozer. Well, if one of the kids got in or out, they   d bump it in gear. I  called her to come move me in this, this particular year. She was going  to bring the truck, but she didn   t realize the wench was in gear and every  time you   d let your foot off the clutch it just kept the wench getting  tighter and tighter. When it gets tight, the truck will not turn. She had the  truck pulled up out here in the corner at the barn. (Laughter) Couldn   t  move it. Came and got me that day and I thought that was pretty  interesting, but she was a pretty good truck driver.  Yes, thanks Jim.  The things you   ve done.  I   m sure you   ve gotten stuck a couple times?  Oh, my goodness  The first dozer that we would run the tracks off of     when you   re building the pond, you have to do some forward pushing  and it would run the tracks off in the pond that you were building.  (Laughter) And that   s a nightmare. And yes, he   s been stuck. He got  some things stuck in quicksand once, and we lost a dozer. I mean, it  came up over the motor, everything. It was an outrageous thing. We  almost totally lost it. After it turned out to be such a job to get it  repaired, we wished we   d have just     32  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder     shoved it down     (Laughter)  But we did have insurance, because it was a new dozer. That was about  1971.  At that time had you started doing any oil field or were you still strictly  ponds at that time?  Still ponds and farm work. Actually, we were doing a development with  the Carney banker at that time at Wellston, Jerry Wolf.  And you got in some quicksand.  I tell you, that first old dozer, they had drilled a well down here at my  parents, who were farming this place. They had drilled a well there, and  I got the job to get to fill the pit. Boy, I was excited. I think it was going  to pay a hundred dollars. It was so exciting. I could work a week and get  a hundred dollars out of that old bulldozer. I got in there and you talk  about getting stuck. I got stuck in that pit, and drilling mud is slime.  That   s all it is. You run a track off in the slime without another dozer to  get it out of there, so I actually had a little bitty farm tractor, and I would  shovel dirt on a little scoop and haul that mud out until I could get that  track and get it broke and get it back on that dozer. We had to clean that  pit out by hand. I did. It wasn   t we, it was just me. But I learned a lot  that way. (Laughter) That   s whyt I said I think I   ve got more than a  college equivalent with equipment.  Oh yes, I would say so   But that was one of the interesting times we got stuck. One time with  that same first dozer, I was pushing trees   I   d said my brother-in-law  and sister lived over there on the highway and I was pushing trees. I  didn   t have a cab; I didn   t think you needed a cab when I was young so  no top over me at all. I was pushing trees, and the wind was blowing real  hard. I was pushing into the wind so you   d kind of squint your eyes.  First thing I knew there was a tree right across my lap, and this dozer   s  sitting there spinning, pushing that tree. And I wasn   t near this fat or I  couldn   t have breathed. (Laughter) But, this tree it was about that big  around and it   s sitting right across my lap and the clutch, you had to  push forward to make it stop. Well, the tree was on the clutch pushing it  back. I couldn   t do nothing, but I could reach over and hit the throttle. I  couldn   t reach it, but I could kill it. I killed the bulldozer. I was sitting  there, just pinned and someone called and needed me. I had an old truck,  at that time, to move it. It was the same little wench truck she had a  problem with, but they needed something at Carney with that wench  truck. Somebody had run out from under a trailer by chance and thought  33  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  I could pick it up for them. She came over there to hunt me. And I   d sat  there long enough   I didn   t wet my pants or mess them or anything     (Laughter)  Jim   Well, I mean     I   m proud of you, Dad      but I had sat there a long time. But anyhow, it seemed probably a lot  longer than it was but she came down there, and I   d figured out how to  get off it. She got kind of excited when she saw me sitting there in the  trees.  Well, that was when she still liked you. (Laughter)  Yes. But there was a tree across my lap and I said,    Oh, I   m alright, I   m  alright.    I said,    There isn   t no problem.    I told her what we could do to  get me off and we did. Actually, while I was sitting there it knocked the  muffler off in the process. Have you ever had something just pressing on  you to hold your breath just a little bit?  Not really.  You   ve never lived until you just got where you just   snugged. But  anyhow, that thing was just holding me there. I could breathe but I  couldn   t take a real deep breath. So I waited until the muffler cooled. It  was laying down there by my feet, and I could reach it. I got it up there  and propped it down in there by the side of me, and I could breathe deep  then so I was fine. But I couldn   t get off. I was just there.  Some close calls?  Yes.  (Laughs) There have been.  But that was just one of them.  I was always afraid something would happen to him like that. And so  sometimes I would go and check on him. I went to check on him one  time, and he wasn   t on the dozer. The dozer was running but he wasn   t  on it, and I thought,    Oh, my gosh  What now?    He had gotten down  and he   d got inside the track, between the track and the dozer. He was so  cold that he got in there, and he was trying to warm his hands up.  34  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  It was that year that we had to run all those hours so any day that I could  ride the dozer I was going to be riding it. It had a top on it but no cab,  and oh, it was cold. I got so cold so I got down in there, and I was  getting warmed up, for a break.  But he couldn   t hear me calling him, and I went around the dozer. So I  couldn   t find him, because he was down inside there and liked to scared  me to death   Well, I was in the trees so the wind wouldn   t blow, where I could get  warmed up.  Well, going back to the original Centennial Farm, the 160 acres, when it  came into your possession, you were telling me that you did a lot of  conservation efforts on that land. Why was that so important?  My grandfather just farmed it up and down the hills or wherever   they  didn   t think about it eroding. They weren   t worried about the wind and  the rain doing away with it. I want to leave a legacy possibly, that every  one of these farms we   ve got, that they   ll be better when I die than they  were when I got them. It   s important: if you   re going to run cattle, you  have to get grass   got something anyhow. But I just like the idea if  somebody says something,    Okay, well that farm   s better than it was  when you got it.     Well, it was washing. He had to do something.  Yes, it was eroding away. The topsoil was mainly gone.  How many acres do you now have total?  Twenty-eight hundred.  That   s a lot of land. How do you keep up with all that land?  We hurry. (Laughter)  We hurry, yes. Still go a lot of hours. It   s a little easier now than it was  before we retired, but we still run cattle on it. Keep up with it. Actually,  after we sold the business, I bought me a new bulldozer. I   ve got a new  bulldozer sitting up here.  You just can   t get away from the bulldozer.  No.  35  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  That   s right. I do love it.  He says he still plays in the dirt, is what he tells people.  Yes. You know some kids, you play in the dirt when you   re a little kid  and some people grow out of it, but I never did.  Jim   s grandmother that was the Indian, she came from El Dorado. Her  dad was a preacher and he was killed   these two guys got in a fight over  a dog, and he tried to step between them, and he got stabbed in the throat  and died. And so she ended up with a stepdad and so that whole family,  we can   t find out   I tried to find out a lot of stuff with genealogy, and  because of the Indian thing and the thing that her family disowned her  and all that, we   ve had a terrible time trying to find her ancestors.  Well, that is a serious looking family tree.  Yes, it   s a lot of fun. (Laughter) But, actually, this one is     You did an awesome job.     just Jim   s grandpa, his grandpa is William and he has the Centennial  Farm, but then his dad homesteaded a place a mile south of here. Jim   s  nephew owns it now but I think that they sold it off for a few years in  between there before they bought it back again, so it   s not to the  centennial thing yet.  What are some of the bigger changes when it comes to farming from  when you were growing up as a young boy to today?  Well, the first thing, we went from horses to a tractor. At that time   tractors were  twenty-five horsepower. Well, the tractors today, it   s a  pretty small tractor at a hundred horsepower. The cab, heat and air on  the tractors. We   re spoiled. Fertilizer, we didn   t have fertilizer when I  was a kid, to grow crops like we do now. Bermuda grass     I think the trading really changed. At that time you   d help somebody  else get their hay in and then they   d come and help you.  Yes, that   s right. Like Oscar Nettles, the neighbor over here had the hay  baler. We had the cutter. We would cut the hay and he would bring his  baler and rake. Or we had the rake. We had the cutter and the rake. We   d  cut it and rake it, and then he would bale it and then we   d go do his or  vice versa and go around. The Amarons, the same way. We would work  with different neighbors. My folks didn   t have a truck or a pickup.  They   d haul feed in the back of the car, cow feed, actually. Roy Neal  36  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  was a neighbor on the other side of Carney, but he had a truck that we   d  haul our hogs and the cattle to Oklahoma City     Oh, now there   s a story.  Which one? Oh, loading the hogs? He had a hot-shot one time when I  was a little kid. My dad always complained   they didn   t have arthritis  treatment   I thought then it was just to get by for him not to want to do  something when he was getting older. But he has arthritis real bad and  couldn   t do a lot of things. He never believed in building good corrals  and pens or anything, and we just had kind of an old makeshift loading  shoot. And Roy Neal would come and get our hogs. We were loading  hogs that day and he had a brand new hot-shot, which no one had used  around before this. But, my dad and him would get in there and push the  hogs up this old shoot in the truck, and so he handed that hot-shot to my  mother and he said,    Now when they get close, you hit them with that  hot-shot.    But, they was pushing a hog up there   one of the contrary  ones   and she hit my dad with that hot-shot. (Laughter) Now he loaded  that hog I guarantee you with some choice words. He had a way with  words there that we won   t use but    (Laughter)  And that   s something else I could tell you, going back to my childhood,  that   s kind of interesting. When we went to the State Fair, it was where  Douglass School is in Oklahoma City now. They would not permit     well, it   s probably the school buses wouldn   t have made it that far, but  we couldn   t take a school bus to the fair. But, when you got to be in the  seventh grade, you got to go to the fair. So we would go in Roy Neal   s  stomp truck. (Laughter)  Just load all of you in the back.  He would actually wash it out before     Well, that   s good. That was nice of him. (Laughter)  But, he would load that old truck full of kids and take us to the fair.  The school wouldn   t allow you go to on the school bus     No.      but they would allow you go to on that farm truck?  That   s right.  Nobody was sue-happy yet.  37  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Yes, yes that   s the truth.  And did you participate in FFA  Future Farmers of America , or 4-H?  Yes, I was in 4-H when I was a kid and then I was FFA. Actually, I was  president of the FFA at Carney at one time.  And you   d show your     Oh, yes, that   s another thing, too, that   s really different from today; you  were asking the difference? When I was showing, I had a particular steer  I was showing   when the judge wasn   t looking, I   d rake stuff up under  him so his belly would be closer to the ground. And then, when our kids  started showing they would rake the stuff away and you want all leg.  (Laughter) Cattle have changed that much. And kind of a strange thing, I  bought some bulls last year, and they   re honestly going back to the  things like what I showed, for some reason. I guess just to make a  change, but they   re going back to the shorter-legged animals.  You showed a Hereford, right?  Yes.  Do you still feel that sense of community within the farmers in the area?  Do you all still help each other?  No, no. We   re the only farm between Carney and Tryon now where  there used to be every place had a farmer on it. There   s no one here to  neighbor with, honestly. What few people that do still farm, we still  neighbor with, but they   re busy. They do their own thing. We do our  own thing more now than we used to.  They don   t have crop crops the way   the wheat and then they have the  hay. And that   s pretty much all that   s raised right through here now.  Found out it doesn   t grow cotton good after they lost all of our topsoil.   With  corn you can grow it in the little bottoms, but it   s such small  fields, it   s not worth messing with so we just grow hay and wheat. And  not even much wheat anymore. When Ann and I got married, we grew a  lot of wheat. Actually, this was a wheat field around this house.  When I was a kid you still had some alfalfa.  Yes, we grew alfalfa, but the bugs eat it up here so bad now so very few  people grow that.  38  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Now you pasture your wheat. You harvest it a little but you still pasture  a little and that   s it.  But we learned wheat farming from western Oklahoma, and we can  grow it. Our cows can do real good on it if we get it in the pasture so we  do more good with Bermuda grass here than probably anything else.  Like this field across the road used to be one of the bigger fields around  here. It   s about forty acres and it   s in grass now.  What are some of the challenges of being a farmer today? You notice  your farming neighbors have kind of gone to the wayside     You have to have a lot of land if you   re going to farm. You have to  either be big or not at all, because you can   t just farm a little bit and  make a living. You just can   t do that.  You still have people, varmints, cows, dogs, bobcat maybe, long-tailed  cat now and then, come through here. Last week we lost a calf.  Something ripped it open, so it had to be a cat. Then a couple of nights  later, coyotes or a dog got one. You can tell the difference in the way  they kill them. And we   ve had them problems. The expense of doing  stuff, like when we started buying, say nice tractors we could really buy  a nice tractor when the cabs came out for  20,000 or even less. Now you  buy a nice cab tractor, 125-horse cab tractor, it   s  80,000 to  100,000.  The cash flow is unreal.  The environmentalists have been     And the environmentalists   oh.      a real nightmare. The fertilizer and the weed kill that they have to buy  now is so much more expensive, because there   s the minutest, tiniest,  itsy-bitsy potential that a field mice could one day have one ear instead  of two if they don   t use this particular brand. It   s just gotten ridiculous  about the environmental regulations for fertilizer and weed kill.  Well, and for instance   this even happened in the    80s kind of when it  was getting started. They drilled a well over here on my parents    place in  the early    50s. It was a good one. But instead of worrying about salt  water, they just dug a big pit, dumped the water in the pit. Well, that  killed about ten acres over here. I figured when they had an oil boom  here in the early    80s, we might as well get that pit filled and make a few  dollars out of it. So they got some of the pits they   d want to haul the  drilling mud off. So I could charge a hundred dollars for them to dump  some mud over here, making them a few bucks. And dog-gone one of  the environmentalists followed them in here. They fined us a thousand  39  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  dollars at that time for dumping drilling mud in that salt pit. And they  said, I mean, I really and truly   we could   ve gotten a lawyer and beaten  this because the only thing that was bad in the drilling mud was the  chromium that wore off of the drill pipe that they could prove, and can  you   I mean, you probably saw them drill an oil well, the pipe turning.  There   s very little friction to where the side of the drill pipe   that   s not  where it wears, but that   s what they said they could find, a trace of it  here so they fined us. At that particular time, it was a thousand dollar  fine. That was just kind of the starting of it.  They said that we had to haul this mud and dispose of it and we said,     Okay, so where do you dispose of it?    There   s no place to dispose of it.  It   s illegal to dispose it. But we had to haul it and dispose it somewhere.  You have to make up your mind and either have to haul it and do  something with it, but I can   t do anything with it. Didn   t make sense.  And how good some of the rules are. They drilled a well out behind the  house here. Honestly, we cut the pit when they got done drilling and  spread the mud out there and that   s legal.  Now, I   m not sure I   m remembering this right, but down there at the salt  pits, after you used the drilling mud, now it grows grass, right?  Oh, it does.  But prior to that, it was completely dead.  Yes, it was. That   s right.  I would say the environmental regulations have been a nightmare  farming-wise.  And, of course, she   s got the dozer service now, where we mine the  shale up here. That   s a mining operation. We don   t just dig clay off the  hill. It   s a mining operation.  And it   s our dirt. We own the property, but we can   t haul that off  without paying the state a fee, because it   s a mining operation. So we  have to pay them.  And you have to file a reclamation     Yes.  We get tired of the rules and regulations.  40  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  As far back as you can remember, has there been a lot of oil drilling on  the properties?  Not a whole lot, but there   s been a little bit.  A little bit? And those royalties are still with the family?  Yes, most of it. Most of it.  On the Centennial Farm, there   s an oil well up there.  And we don   t have the minerals under it. My uncle Tippet, his  daughters    got them.  Tell me a little bit about your kids. How many kids do you have? What  are they doing now?  We   ve got four. The oldest one   s a son, then Pam, then Julie, then Mary.  Jim is actually working for us right now. He   s working the farm, kind of  managing it. Helping us. Pam we sold the dozer business to. Julie is  married to a preacher. She   s got four little boys and they live down by  Norman. Too bad. (Laughter) Kind of in bad country.  We send them a lot of orange clothing. A lot of orange clothing.  That   s good.  And our youngest daughter, Mary, is married to a farmer that lives west  of Carney about ten miles, no man   s land over there, on a real good  creek, but you just can   t get there from here.  We have fifteen grandchildren.  Oh, my goodness gracious   And four greats.  Yes, that   s true.  So Pam, do you get up in the dozer and get dirty? Or do you just  manage?  No. I manage. I get dirty occasionally, but I don   t operate the equipment.  I know what it   ll do, but I don   t do it. (Laughs) No, I go and get the jobs  and then just get the guys out on them. I don   t care if we had a female  operator, but it doesn   t come up much. It   s unusual.  41  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Yes, there   s probably not many in the business I would guess.  Once in a while we have a woman truck driver, or she does.  It was you, whenever you all had it. We   ve only had it for three and a  half years. We bought them out three and a half years ago so that   s why  it   s a    we    still.  So what   s retirement been like?  I   ll tell you, it   s a killer. (Laughter)  I can warn you, don   t bother retiring. You will work yourself to death   We have the farm and we run a lot of cattle, and it got behind while we  were in the business. Let a lot of things go that we   re still working at  catching up. And it really, really is tough now   we have a tric ycle    a  motorcycle tric that needs to be ridden pretty regularly.  A lot  (Laughter)  And the farm and cattle operation really gets in the way of it  (Laughter)  They also do some real estate development, and they   ve still got some  oil properties.  Yes. I don   t know if you noticed Kinder Wells in Perkins  Oklahoma   where the Williams grocery store is?  Oh yes. The development?  That   s our development. So then we   ve got one with Pam over at Four  Corners, got one south of Carney and one west of Four Corners. We stay  rather busy.  Then, all of us kids use them on a consulting basis. (Laughter) So we  drag them out of the house pretty regular for that.  Where are holidays today? Here?  Yes.  Well, good.  Yes, that   s why we need all this space here, to feed everybody. That  space in there     42  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  I could tell you kind of a funny about this house. This used to be three  rooms. You see what it is now. We tore the walls out. One time Ann   s  friend was down in Florida, so she needed to go check on her so while  she was gone, that was two rooms in there. When she got back it was  one. (Laughter) She was excited.  I was.  Oh, she was a little excited alright. Dad didn   t mention that he didn   t  throw down plastic or anything as he took the wall out. She had knick-knacks  everywhere.  Well, I put them up. I put them in that back bedroom.  I don   t remember it like that.  I never found the things that were in that one room that he did away  with. I don   t know what happened to all that stuff. And he doesn   t know.  But it sure made a nice, big living room.  Yes. We can get all the grandkids and the kids and stuff     Well, I want you to think back   all three of you   to one of your favorite  family stories that you haven   t shared with me today. It could be from  when you were little. It could be from when you were first starting out. It  could be when you really got stuck. It could be anything you would like  to share with us. And we can start with whoever first.  Go ahead and I will think.  Well, I   ll tell you one. I   m pretty quiet myself, but I   ll throw one in.  Once when I was a little kid   a lot of times, we   d take turns. Grandma  and Grandpa just lived across the way, and we   d walk down there. We   d  take turns getting to spend the night. It would be our turn and     whenever there   s four of you all, little, doing anything by yourself was  pretty exciting. I   d gone down there and Grandpa was going to go  fishing. Well, his version of going fishing was he had a little fold up cot  and a cane pole, and we went down there and he wanted a nap. That   s  what he wanted. But we   d leave out the back door, and it was a pretty  fair walk to the pond. When that screen door slammed behind me, he  turned to me and he said,    Shhh  You   ll scare the fish.    And I was to  keep my mouth shut all the way to the pond. (Laughter) I don   t know  why we always argued to get to go with Grandpa fishing because that  was the standing rule. When that door slammed       Shhh  You   ll scare  the fish.    That   s how he kept all those little kids from chattering the  43  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  whole time. There were plenty of us.  I have a favorite story about him, but I don   t know any other stories. His  nephew is the same age he is; that   s one of the reasons he calls his mom     Granny.    Anyway, they all went down to the pond. Greg, Dad Kinder  went down there and went swimming, and he got naked to do that. So  Jim and Dick went down there and gathered up his clothes and threw  them in the pond. (Laughter) And then they came back to the house and  wooo, he was something upset. So he had to come back up to the house  naked. So he came up kind of a little draw and got up to the house and of  course, Jim had gone to his mom and wanted her to protect him from  Dad. (Laughter) Dad was going to see to him when he got there but  Granny didn   t let him. I think he went off and hid somewhere     Yes, I did. (Laughter)  Until Grandpa cooled off.      until Grandpa cooled down, yes. (Laughter)  I guess there was a big fish in that pond. I don   t know what happened to  his clothes. Because we just threw them out there a little ways, and he  couldn   t find them  (Laughter)  Funny how those things happen.  Yes, yes.  Alright Jim, you   re on the spot.  Yes, I   m trying to think of a little outstanding, but I don   t know.  Something that we haven   t already talked about probably.  What about Aunt Marguerite and trading out work for lunch?  Oh, yes. My uncle over at Meridian now, after I got a dozer that I could  get to work, I was over there   I   d always go over there and work about  a week in the winter and it   d get cold, but my uncle would always come  and get me for lunch. I hated beans with a passion. I just don   t like  beans. Well, I didn   t used to anyway; at that time I didn   t. It was about  as bad as meatloaf. I just didn   t eat them. That   s all she had was beans  and cornbread that day, and boy, I was starving to death. And in the  winter, you just eat more. So I went up there and I ate beans, and I ate  beans and cornbread, and  more  cornbread. It was good. I mean, I just  had to enjoy it a little. I didn   t like it, but I enjoyed it because it filled me  up. Went back to work. She was a real good cook but that next year I  44  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  went back to do some more work and she told Ann   she called her, I  think, that day and said,    Oh, I   m cooking a big bowl of beans again  today. You know, Jim loved them so well.    (Laughter) Said,    I know he  just loved those beans. I fixed him some more.    That was kind of a  funny story so I enjoyed them again.  You had to be nice.  I did. I   m very polite. Always.  Or something. (Laughs)  Very careful about how I say things.  You haven   t talked about gardening and canning. Did your mother have  a big garden?  Yes.  Oh, yes. Huge.  A real big garden. She always gardened lots.  And she was good at it. She raised lots and lots of stuff, and she canned  a lot, a lot of stuff. They had this cellar and she would can all of the  things. By the time I got Jim, Granny and Dad were by themselves, but  every year she did that anyway. The next year she would pour that stuff  out. Or, actually, it wasn   t the next year. She had like, three rows of stuff  and each year she would pull that next one up to here and the back the  one up to there and then the new canned goods back here. But then she   d  throw out the oldest year and use those jars to can in again. I always  thought,    Man, that is a lot of hard work     (Laughter) And then she just  threw them away the next year, because she just loved to can that kind of  thing. And I always thought,    That   s more trouble than I need.     (Laughs)  Were there fruit trees on the property?  A few. Not very many fruit trees.  We did the plums and grapes and     Peaches.      there were peaches? I don   t remember that.  45  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Finchum  A. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  Yes, they didn   t do too good, but they had a couple of peach trees.  I don   t remember that.  Your work was quite a partnership, and you worked a lot so what did  you do for fun? (Laughter)  Worked. (Laughter)  Fun? We were married twelve years before we ever took a break and left  the farm. That was the first vacation that we ever took.  Boy, it was a good one though. Where did we go on that one?  We actually went to the bulldozer yard in Woodward, and we spent the  night there and Jim bought a bulldozer on the way while we were going  to     Colorado.  Colorado. And then when we came back we got the bulldozer and  brought it home. But, we actually went and spent the night   at that time  we had this little fold down camper thing and that   s     We had to have a place to park it.  Well, and we couldn   t afford to     And it was safe there.  We couldn   t afford to take all the children and go on vacation to the  motels and places to eat and all that stuff so this was our way to do that.  So now when Jim says   or if anybody says to me,    Do we want to  camp?    A lot of the people on the motorcycles camp. Not I. No, we will  stop at a motel and   oh, I hated camping. It was hard, hard work. That  was our break but it was hard work.  You got married when? What year?     62. We   ve been married forty-eight years last week and Jim bought me  these dozen roses. They   re beginning to wear out right now, but they  have been gorgeous. Forty-eight years. That   s a long time.  That is a long time.  She   s lucky. (Laughter)  46  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  Finchum  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  I still don   t have any      Oh, she wakes up every morning and says that    I   m so lucky to have  Jim.     Yes.  Yes. Every morning and then again in the evening I say that.  Might not be in those words.  But you knew the meaning.  So where did you get married?  At the farm where I grew up. We got married   we had a doorway like  this and all my brothers and sisters and I got married in that doorway.  We put the flowers up around the doorway like that and made a thing.  Preacher stood on this side and we stood in doorway and then all the  people were back behind there.  That   s a good tradition.  It was, really. Actually, I said all of the brothers and sisters, but my  youngest brother   of course, when he got married his wife got to choose  where they were going to get married, and they got married at church.  But all the rest of us got married there.  Is there anything else you   d like to add that we haven   t spoken about  today? Anything you want to throw in?  During the 1930s, was there anything in particular that the farm did  to     That   s before my time.  Do you now know what your mom and dad said?  They had it hard. Really, I mean they really did.  One thing I remember about them having it so hard is my grandmother,  even when I was a little girl, she had one drawer in her kitchen. She had  store-bought bread by that time. Whenever she was done with the bread,  she would dump that plastic baggie out and she   d rinse it in the sink and  she   d lay it over her dish drainer and once it was dry, she   d fold it up  neatly and put it in that drawer. She had a drawer plum full of those  47  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Wonder Bread bags with the big old circles on them. And she   d do it  with the butter tub. Never would she throw anything away. As we got a  little older, you would have a vacation Bible school project or anything  and then need coffee cans or butter tubs or anything, we   d go to the  older ladies, like Grandma or somebody, in the church, and they would  have those gathered up because they threw nothing, nothing away. She   d  save her bacon grease      And the twisty-ties off the bread thing. She had a kitchen full of those.  Little pieces of string that came off of something. She would save those  little pieces of string. It was amazing.  That was a big old deep drawer and it went way back in the cabinet.  You   d slide that or that there would be the bread bags all folded and the  twist-ties in a little butter tub and then a stack of butter tubs, and then  she had another cabinet that was plum full of butter tubs and coffee cans,  and they were going to be prepared.  Saved everything.  They were going to be ready for the next time things were that bad.  When I was a kid, we   d get feed, especially chicken feed would come  with flowery printed sacks, and she   d cut them up and make quilts, and  the neighbors would get together and they   d come to our house and  quilt. That was pretty neat. Played dominos.  A time or two, I remember some of the quilts she made also were from  her curtains.  Yes.  The curtains that   d hang on the west side and get faded a little bit. She   d  make new curtains and then she   d use those for the quilt, and you could  see the kitchen curtains in your quilt. She always quilted in the  wintertime. She   d say if she quilted in the wintertime it kept her warm  while she was quilting it, and it kept her warm when she was done. But  even when we were little kids, it was still pretty broke out here.  Everybody was broke. We didn   t think anything about it, because all the  neighbors were, too.  Well, I would say when we got electricity there was one light upstairs in  each room   there were two rooms   actually, the old house is still down  there. There   s three rooms upstairs. The third room was never finished. I  don   t know why. It was a junk room, I guess, so they started putting junk  in it before they finished it, but you talk about the cold. That old  48  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Finchum  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  upstairs   we didn   t have a bit of heat up there. That   s where I always  slept. You just kept piling on more covers.  Did the snow ever blow in?  No, it was tight enough to keep snow out.  And to get dressed to go to school in the morning you   d hustle  downstairs?  You   re not kidding. (Laughter) You   d get downstairs pretty fast.  Step lively.  Pretty fast.  When I was growing up, where we were, we didn   t have vehicles.  Grandpa and Grandma lived down to the corner south of us and my  other grandparents   actually, my other grandparents just lived two miles  away, and I still didn   t meet Jim. I don   t know. But anyway, we had to  go back and forth with a team and wagon. We didn   t have a vehicle.  And we would go to Tryon to do our trading and stuff   sell the cream  and eggs and things and buy whatever groceries we were going to get.  Now, there   s not much there, is there?  No.  No.  Was Tryon more happening than Carney at that time?  Not at that time.  They were both booming like     They were.  Tryon had two cotton gins; Carney had three, at one time.  Had a hardware store.  Had a movie theater.  Had a hotel in both of them.  49  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Kalka  Finchum  A. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Hardware stores.  Yes, hardware stores in both of them; two or three grocery stores; a  lumber yard in both towns. There was a lumber yard in both towns when  I was little, but     There was still one in Tryon when I came along.  Yes, well, when we built this house, we got all the material at Tryon.  And I have to ask, was there a public library at either one?  There is at Tryon.  Now, but was there then?  They just opened one.  Well, it   s probably been ten or fifteen years, but not when we first     there was a library at both schools.  And grown-ups could check stuff out, too.  Right.  You didn   t have to be a student. Grown-ups couldn   t check out at the  school library when I was little.  Any home remedies?  Oh  Jim   s grandma, the one we told you was an Indian, she would go  out and gather the herbs and things, and she would put them in the cellar  and keep those for medicinal purposes. There was a lot of     Grandma Kinder thought Campho-Phenique cured everything. There  was nothing a little Campho-Phenique couldn   t fix. (Laughs) But that  was way later.  We had the old guy that would come by peddling   what was it?  I don   t know. That just went right through      Cloverine salve. I   d see it when I was a kid, but the Raleigh man, he  would come by and sell spices and remedies. We   d have that stuff when  I was a kid.  50  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Finchum  Kalka  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  And how often would he come through?  Once a month maybe. Pretty regular, maybe.  Do you know castor oil? Do you know what that is? That is a really  good remedy for disciplinary problems. (Laughter)  Where are you all from?  My mother used to use that for     I   m from the hills of Tennessee, North Carolina, that area.  Really?  I   m sorry. (Laughter)  I   m from Miami, Florida.  Oh, wow.  Well, that   s probably worse, isn   t it? (Laughter)  Mom said her grandma used to use chewing tobacco for the bee stings     Right, and they would chew that and put that on your hand. I put my  hand up in the barn once, and yellow jackets stung all over my hand, and  they put that stuff on there. Honestly, it took out the sting. It really did.  With all the train tracks going through, did hobos come through at all?  My mother used to feed them regularly. They swore that there was a  mark on the railroad near by their house because they was just a little  ways    Actually, the railroad track was right there by that power pole  here, and it wasn   t much farther where I grew up right down here   just  a little bit farther, but those hobos would be there all the time.  Would she put them to work?  There was one they told me about that they worked regular, I mean for a  while, but most of them wouldn   t work. She   d feed them, and they   d go  on.  Did you ever hop on the train and go anywhere?  No, but we did play on the old push cars.  51  Finchum  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  Kalka  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  So when did they take the train out, when did it stop     Yes. In the late    70s, I believe.  They had to. Matt and I played on it quite a bit so that would   ve been     Yes, I believe it was the late    70s. I   ll tell you a funny story after we  built this   when did we build this house? Sixty something         63.  We had a preacher and his wife was a blonde   I   ll tell this story and a  blonde joke. This old railroad was over here and they had abandoned it  then but it was still there. She had heard of snipe hunting. Have you all  been snipe hunting? You   ve never lived. I shouldn   t tell the story     you   ll get to go someday. (Laughter) But they came out to visit us and  they had a young family, and I was telling her,    Oh, it   s fun.    I said,    If  you   ll go over here       I said,    This is a pretty good place here on this  old railroad. You can sit right here on that rail, get you a little stick, just  tap that rail or tap that tie where you   re sitting and call them. Say,     Come here snipe.    And hold your bag out.  You have to hold the bag so they can     And said,    You   ll get them in a little bit.    She didn   t ask what they  looked like. So I said,    The rest of us will go drive them in to you.    So  here she sits, tapping that rail.    Here snipey, here snipey     And here we  just come on back to the house. We was just having us a big time.  (Laughter) She sat over there, and we finally had to go get her. If there is  a snipe, I don   t know what it is. So I never saw one.  I don   t think we   ll ever go snipe hunting. (Laughter)  Now I know   If somebody takes you snipe hunting, just leave and lead them back to  the house.  I was going to say, it wasn   t fair. It wasn   t fair to tell you that, but it was  so funny. She was serious. She   d sit there and tap that so gently, just  barely tapping it.    Here snipey, here snipe      Is there anything else any of you would like to add?  I don   t think. I think that   s pretty much it. The guy who homesteaded the  place, William, I forgot how many children they had. Give me one  52  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  Finchum  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  Finchum  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  second here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Nine  kids   they had nine children. No wonder the house was full and the big  boys had to sleep in the barn.  Oh, yes.  I thought you all would ask why we decided to stay here and do this?  Yes, well why did you?  Because we were too poor to do anything else.  Yes, listen to that. (Laughs)  So we just had to stay here.  Well, it   s not a bad life.  Yes, it   s been good.  Our last question usually is what do you see for the next one hundred  years?  I   m going to heaven. (Laughter) I do not know what is going to go on  here, but I   m going on to heaven.  You mean actually the farmstead?  Yes.  I really think that one of our grandsons is enough interested in this to  keep it together. Hope so. He   s showed quite a bit of interest and he   s  said so a time or two that he would like to somehow and that he   s  capable. I think that   ll happen.  Another reason not to    quite    retire?  Right. (Laughs)  Well, that   s a good reason not to until he   s ready.  Right.  But, too many people retire, sit down and die.  And there   s a lot of things to do.  53  J. Kinder  Finchum  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  Kalka  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  I   ll soon be seventy years old, and I don   t think I   m seventy years old  age-wise   I mean, I hurt and ache and get tired, a lot more awkward  than I used to be, but as far as quitting at seventy years old, I don   t think  that   s the right time to quit for me. Might be for somebody else, but not  for me. There   s too many things I need to get done. There   s lots of  cedars still around here that I   ve got to get rid of. A few gulleys left to  shape. And one of my grandsons   it was a big highlight this past  Christmas break   he   s going to OSU and he was out long enough to  bring one of Pam   s dozers, and we built a big pond up on the north place  here, so that   s exciting to get to work with our son and our grandson.  Our son   s here working now and that   s really neat.  So it   s definitely staying in the family.  Yes.  Yes. When they first moved here, they kind of came in groups. All the  people would get together and move here. But, all those children that I  told you about, the nine children, three of them married brothers and  sisters and one of them married a cousin so all of the Kinders married  Kaugers.  Except my dad.  Yes. And he married a Starkes, but anyway, I thought that was really  something. So all of those kids are double cousins, because their moms  and dads are     Related.  Yes. I thought that was funny.  Well, then what   s around you is what you know.  Right. I knew all of Jim   s aunts and uncles. I went to church with his  aunt that had her arm blown off. As I was growing up as a little kid, I  went to church with her, and his uncle Tom drove my school bus. And  he was my uncle Tom same time he was Jim   s. All us kids called him  Uncle Tom and so when I married him, I already knew some of his  people.  It   s just a small world.  Yes.  It is.  54  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  A. Kinder  Nykolaiszyn  A. Kinder  J. Kinder  A. Kinder  It took the movie theater to get you together.  That   s right. Actually, my sister was dating one of his friends.  Well, the one I went to the movies with.     and my little sister introduced us. I   ve been mad at her  ever since .  (Laughter)  Thank you for coming. This has been fun.  We appreciate you telling us some stories of your life and your farms,  and we thank you very much.  Well, you   re welcome.  Thank you all for coming.  It was lots of fun. I appreciate you coming.  -------  -------
