 Finchum  K. Lewis  Finchum  K. Lewis  Today is November 12, 2012. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University, and I am here in Okarche, Oklahoma, which  is in Kingfisher County, today to speak with K. Kay Brandes-Lewis  regarding her centennial farm. This is part of our Oklahoma Centennial  Farm Families project, so thank you very much for meeting me here  today.  And thank you for asking me. Old dragon English teachers just can  never resist a chance of a lecture. (Laughter) I thought I   d start by telling  you just a little bit about Okarche. Okarche is a very interesting town.  It   s O-K for Oklahoma, A-R for Arapaho, C-H-E for Cheyenne. It   s a  made word. And Okarche is especially interesting because the main  street is half in Kingfisher County and half in Canadian County.  (Laughs) All of these towns were platted and plotted before people were  permitted to enter. The streets were named, everything was laid out, and  I cannot imagine why they would have a town half in Kingfisher and  half in Canadian. But it worked out real well for the bootleggers back in  the bootleggers    day, because all they had to do was get that liquor half  way across the street and they were safe. (Laughs) That was it.  There are two famous places here in Okarche, one is the bank. It   s the  oldest continuously active state bank in the state of Oklahoma and  they   re celebrating their   or they celebrated their 120th anniversary last  week. This was opened March 19, 1892 and the bank began sometime in  November. My grandfather was one of the earliest depositors, and they  also had the first safety deposit box.  And what was your grandfather   s name?  Oh, we   ll come to that. As I said, I   m an old dragon English teacher. I  have it all arranged right here  (Laughs) But I   ve had to make some  choices and I tried to organize it, and it just didn   t come up organized. I  was going to start with a couple of quotes that teachers   I also taught  5  history   teachers like.    The past is a country to which we cannot go.     So, it   s very hard to make a twenty-first century mind understand what a  nineteenth century mind was working with. What was wonderful to them  is totally yucky to us. Now, I   m talking about people who looked at this  as a fabulous chance, a homestead, free land, a real chance to make  something, to do something, to have something. This meant everything  in the world to all of our folks out here. We were talking at a fiftieth  wedding anniversary a week ago about how hard our parents and our  grandparents and our great-grandparents fought to have this land, to  keep this land, and to keep it for us.  It   s amazing because so many of our stories are exactly the same. They  had so much the same frontier experience, so much the same World War  I experience, so much the same Depression experience. And the  Depression, I think, is what really scarred so many of them so much. My  mother was a horrible cook, but she never cooked a meal that mattered  for tasting good. It was a meal to get food on the table to feed us and  that   s all, because they had all had such hard times here. Ken Burns is  going to start a program on the Dust Bowl and the Depression out here  next week, and I   m really going to be interested to see if he understands  the real horror of it and how it scarred them, a whole generation. And in  turn, that generation has somewhat scarred all of us, too, because we   re  awfully careful with our money.    Get things paid off. Don   t buy big  things. Don   t have a new car every year or two years or three years.     I   d also offer a Chinese proverb I just heard,    The palest ink is more  trustworthy than the freshest memory.    And I think it means that family  memories and family history and oral history get changed. It   s told from  the viewpoint of the person telling it. So, there   s no way I can tell what  happened to them the way it happened to them. And I   m going back four  generations here for some of it. So, I have it wrong and it   s changed in  the telling each generation. And I   m doing my best here as an old dragon  English and history teacher to do the best I can to give you a picture of  what I think happened or what I think was going on. Now, I   m not as big  a help with exactly what went on on the farm because I didn   t live here.  I spent a lot of time out here working, but I didn   t live in the buildings.  So, I   m not going to have as full a picture of that, but I understand about  the teaching and I understand about what, I think, as best I can what it  was like for people to live out here.  I suppose we should start with my grandfather, who was Pearl C.  McKemy. It   s either P-E-R-E-L or P-E-A-R-L Calvin McKemy. He was  the son of a judge in Ohio and his father had died, and he had to stay  home and take care of his mother and sisters, worked at the Railway  Express until he got enough money to come West. His older sister, Ella  McKemy Smith, who had married Will Smith, had made the Run, the  6  1892 Run, and they staked land right out here. So, Grandfather came in  two weeks after the Run with his two-hundred dollars and bought the  homestead, the home place that I   m still farming. It   s in Altona  Township. Now, Altona, I don   t think, was a real town. There   s a church  and a cemetery left. At most there would   ve been a store, a blacksmith,  and maybe a school. But all of that disappeared very early and the  church and the  cemetery  are left.  Grandfather spent twenty-five years on the Altona Town Council, the  township council. And I have not been able to find out what the  township council meant. Nobody seems to know, so I   ll check on that  for you. He was on the Mount Pisgah Cemetery Board. And everybody  here says Piz-key, but it   s Mount Pisgah, which is a name from the  bible. And he was president of the school board for Fairview School,  where everybody went. He was an extremely handsome bachelor, very  charming, dark eyes, dark hair. He was a little bit older. He went to the  church at Altona, he went to Salem Church, he went to Mount Pisgah  Church, and he lived in a dugout on his homestead, a dugout down by  the peach tree. (Laughs) I think I know exactly where it was. This nice  young man from Ohio, with parents from Lexington, Virginia, came out  here  to  bach, do what they call bach, in a dugout down by a peach tree  on a dreadful homestead in the middle of Oklahoma where it   s so hot in  the summer, so miserably cold in the  winter  and the wind blows forty  miles an hour all the time and it kicks up the dust. And he just loved it.  He thought the West was the most wonderful thing in the world.  He had a very good friend, Howard Householder. Howard   s family lived  about a mile north and almost a mile east. Howard Householder lived  with a grandfather, and Howard was tall, blonde, and very, very  handsome. Oklahoma was a country of young families, young people,  and they heard about an older family who had some older daughters, five  very pretty daughters. So, these two handsome young men just went  right down the road to the Householders    and they married two of those  girls. (Laughs) Howard married Manila Belle, Aunt Nella, and my  grandfather married Zora. Her name was Alzora, A-L-Z-O-R-A, but  they called her Zora.  Grandfather, P.C., was head of the Fairview School Board and  Grandmother was a schoolteacher and she taught a number of places out  here, and she had taught at Fairview School every year. Grandfather  hired her on September 1, 1903, married her on September 30, 1903, and  they had to close the school. But she taught all the children, all the  Coffees, all the Aligs. She taught her Nunemaker  siblings . Let   s see, I  think I can tell you where exactly each one of these was. I   ve referenced  some maps here that are available on historicmaps.com to get exactly the  right township, quarter, and section number. I   ll continue with him and  7  then I   ll skip over to her and then bring their story together.  Basically, he raised mules, which he sold to Fort Reno, which was not  very far away. He raised alfalfa, he raised wheat, and he did manage to  build a one-room house when he married. (Laughs) I think the one room  was about sixteen-by-twenty with two windows on each side and a door  on this side. (Gestures) Bless their hearts. He built that house and they  lived there. Great-grandmother McKemy came from Ohio, after they  were married, for a visit, stayed a month in this little sixteen-by-twenty  house on this dreadful, dreadful prairie out here, and she never came  back. I wonder why  (Laughs) They had a bad storm while she was here  and they had to go to the cellar. They spent a lot of time in the cellar  running from the storms.  About 1912, they added a T to this little almost square farmhouse and it  had two rooms up and two rooms down and it was kind of centered  across this farmhouse. There was a porch built on on the east side and  eventually a kitchen was built on on the west side. But other than that,  they for the most part lived in this little, one-room house. That   s where  everything took place. Even in my time, that   s where you went. Maybe  you used the other rooms for company and you   d go upstairs to sleep  unless it was too hot or too cold. If it was too hot, you slept outside. If it  was too cold, you slept downstairs close to the heater.  He did marry my grandmother. My mother was born in 1906 and her  name was Arvie, A-R-V-I-E, Belle, B-E-L-L-E. I was so lucky to get K.  Kay as a name. (Laughs) We always said that my daddy thought I was  worth stuttering over because I had aunts Anna Belle, Ara Bella, Fanny  Belle, Manila Belle, a cousin May Belle, Momma was Arvie Belle,  Grandmother was Isabelle. So, I got K. Kay and I was just real thankful.  (Laughs) Her sister came along in 1910 and that was Faye, Aunt Faye,  who was just the most wonderful, wonderful, wonderful person there  ever was. Dr. Wolfe from Okarche here delivered my mother, and he  delivered an awful lot of babies out in there earlier in the years. Later on,  it was Mrs. Gehring and she lived on the William Gehring place in  Altona Township, G-E-H-R-I-N-G. And she was a lovely lady, too.  Children were born on the kitchen table, not in a bed. You weren   t going  to take a chance with all that expensive bedding. Children were born on  a kitchen table. And they had a very hard time with my mother. She was  a ten-pound baby. Yes. And there was no anesthetic and it was just  pretty awful. It took a long time and they really were very concerned  about her. It took long enough that   of course, my grandfather is outside  pacing away   one of grandmother   s sisters, Rhet, or Rhetta, R-H-E-T-T-  A, came out and said,    There   s a terrible laundry to do. If you   ll carry  the water, I   ll do the laundry.    So, they did the laundry while she was  8  being born.  That was a hard chore because you had to carry water from the well.  Then you had to heat this water, and then you had to keep it heated. And  you did the laundry. You did the table linens first, then the dish towels,  then the sheets, then the clothes, and then the outside things, the overalls  and things like that. And it took all day to do. You   re standing out on the  prairie, summer or winter with this terrible wind, and you   re bent over  an open fire scrubbing clothes in a copper pot. The copper pot was  heated and then you had two cold rinses. And I still have the copper pot  at home. We keep firewood in it. (Laughs) My poor husband brings in  firewood every so often, and I have to really get after him about,    Don   t  make any dents in that valuable copper pot.     My mother was redheaded and they were not expecting a redhead.  Redheads were a little unusual on the frontier. The Indians had seen   blondes , but they had never seen  redheads . And one of the Wolves  who lived not too far away   I don   t know whether it was Running Wolf  or Wolf Come Early   one of the Wolves was kind of a friend of my  grandfather, would come visit every so often. He liked my mother   s  long, red curls and he would play with them. He wanted to buy them.  (Laughs) And then he wanted to   well, you know,    How much for the  whole girl?    So, after that my grandmother was just terrified and she and  my mother would go to the cellar when the Indians came. Mother said  she spent half her life in the cellar running from the Indians and the  other half running from storms. The storms were just terrible out here.  Her grandmother, Nunemaker, would bounce her on the knee and would  say,    Arvie Belle, we did not expect a redhead, but we love you  anyway.    (Laughs) Grandfather had a lot of redheaded sisters back in  Ohio and back in Virginia, but none that they   d ever seen. So, being  redheaded was something different.  Mother did have a long life, she lived 100 years. But half her life she  spent living in the cellar, running from the Cheyennes. And these were  the Southern Cheyennes, the ones who had gotten Custer, the ones  named American Horse and Charging Cloud, and they still have families  around here.  This mud out here, this dirt turns to mud, to red, gumbo mud, and it  sucks you down. There was a terrible low place very close to where my  folks lived and my grandfather would have to go down and pull  everybody out. He never charged anybody a penny to be pulled out of  that gumbo. He would always say,    No, no. If you see the girls        Mother and Faye      If you see the girls and they   re having a problem,  you just pull them out free.    And I tell you, if you ever had trouble, car  trouble, you wanted to have my mother or Faye with you. It was  9  uncanny. It was like Grandfather was watching over them and sending  them help, because somebody always showed up to take care of those  two women. It was just uncanny. Okay, we   ve got Mother and Faye up  to about 1910 or    12. I need to back up a little bit.  Let   s see, Grandfather was born in 1869 and died in 1945. He came from  Green County, Ohio. Grandmother was Alzora Nunemaker, married  McKemy. She was born in 1875 and died in 1956. And the Nunemakers  had been what were called    movers.    They moved all over the west.  They were here for a couple years and here for a couple years and here  for a couple years, and I think they would probably had moved out of  here, but the girls were getting married.  Great-  grandmother  Nunemaker said,    I   ve had it. This time we stay.    (Laughs)  My   grandmother was very, very, very pretty. After she died in 1956, one of  the Aufderhars came. I remember him. He kind of shuffled his feet a  little bit and said,    K. Kay, Honey, you   re real pretty. But your  grandmother, she was beautiful.    And she   s been dead more than fifty  years, and I talked to a man out at the fiftieth wedding anniversary, he  said,    Oh, I remember about your grandmother. She made wonderful  light bread and she was so pretty.     When she was a child, all the kids remembered that they would put their  shoes out and put straw in their shoes for Santa Claus. I   ve never heard  of that custom either, but she said they did that. And her description of  her aunts, Aunt Kobe and Aunt Sis, back in Kansas, they went to town  one day and they bought bustles. They came home with bustles and the  kids all laughed and flipped them up, and they couldn   t understand what  that was. So, they only wore their bustles a couple times.  My grandmother was very, very interesting. She was born just about the  time Laura Ingalls Wilder was and remembered the same long winter.  She and I read The Long Winter one winter together, and I think I was  hooked on history and the old days and talking to people and learning  ever since. She talked about that winter and how awful it had been for  them, but they couldn   t see out the  windows  they were in a soddy in  Kansas and they couldn   t see out. They couldn   t get to the barn. They  were very hungry because the chickens all froze to death. They couldn   t  find the cow. The cow was gone. It was a terrible winter, and Laura  Ingalls Wilder   s description of it is really pretty good.  She managed to get some education beyond the country schoolhouse,  and I   m not totally sure exactly what. It   s lost in time and memory. But  they talked about Zora going to college. Now, I don   t think she went to  college. I think it was probably a normal school course, which were the  teacher   s schools, or a summer course for teacher training. Something  like that. But she had more than just the ordinary education. She came  10  with her parents from Kansas, and they didn   t get here until 1896. The  Nunemakers had made the land run in    89, had gotten land, and had  decided it was no good and went back. So, a lot of people came, they  wanted to stay for a winter or so, sell their land. Others came, decided it  was so awful they couldn   t make a life here and went back.  So, the Nunemakers took up a homestead and their homestead was in  Park Township, the northwest quarter of section thirty, and there was a  church on that homestead. Yes, let   s see. Yes, there was a church on that  homestead, that was the Mount Pisgah church and it had   Mount Pisgah  is a bible name. It was a Congregationalist church, and the  Congregationalists had a big missionary effort. Mount Pisgah was  originally Congregationalist. I think Altona was originally  Congregationalist. The Salem church and the cemetery next door, which  was originally Watts Cemetery, which are all on these maps and they   re  fairly well marked on them, those were Congregationalists but they  pulled out. They left. And there was this church building left there, so  Great-Grandfather, Jacob Nunemaker, became a preacher. (Laughs) He  and his wife were buried across the road in Mount Pisgah Cemetery, as  are the senior Householders, Azor, and I think her name was Mary. They  are all buried there at Mount Pisgah. And we kind of try to take care of it  as best we can.  The school at Mount Pisgah was on the southeast corner of section  nineteen, and I don   t know anything about that school. Everybody who  has lived around here and my cousins, nobody knows anything about  that school. So, maybe it was marked for a school that was never built  because the Nunemaker children went over to Fairview School. This  great-grandmother, Lydia Redfern Nunemaker brought a lot of flowers  with her when she came to Oklahoma and they all died. (Laughs) It was  so dry here in the summer so that even if you planted food or flowers,  they all dried up with this hot, dry wind about July. The worst time of  year here was the spring because people could make it through the  winter, but you began to run out of food in the spring. That was the time  when you had to have so much energy to put your crops in, and some  people just practically starved to death. These farmers were very, very  thrifty farmers. That   s all that saved the ones who were saved in the  Depression. They used to have a saying that you   this is a large German  community   that you could always tell the German farms because the  barn was bigger than the house. Houses were not terribly important to  these people. The barns and the outbuildings that made the farms run  were a lot more important.  The Nunemakers grew up out here. They had the northwest quarter of  section thirty. Grandmother taught mostly at Fairview School. It was on  the northwest corner of   in the northwest corner of the southwest corner  11  of section twenty-six in Park Township   oh, Fairview School. I beg  your pardon. Fairview School was on the northwest corner of the  southwest quarter of section twenty-six of Altona Township and that  was part of the Coffee land, the Ed Coffee place.  Mrs. Coffee was Mary Coffee or Mary Ellen Coffee, and she was just a  wonderful lady. She would always go to help everybody in the  community. So, when my mother or sister or grandparents were sick,  Grandfather would put out some kind of a towel or sheet and that would  notify the Coffees that they needed Mrs. Coffee to come. Then Mr.  Coffee would put out a sheet that would notify Mr. Alig, Peter Alig, who  was in the next section over. He would then hitch up his horses, come  get Mrs. Coffee, and take her down to my parents. And then she would  stay until the measles or the mumps or   my mother had these terrible,  terrible ear infections. A lot of children did in those days   and she  would stay until they got better. And then my grandfather, when the  sickness was over, would take her home.  They built this beautiful, big two-story house and she worked terribly  hard. They were Irish immigrants, and she just worked incredibly hard  and eventually she developed a goiter and would have to struggle to  breathe. They did so well, she worked so hard, they built this beautiful  home, and then she had this awful goiter. She died either of the goiter or  of strangulation or of heart failure from struggling with that. They  struggled with a lot of diseases and things that we never think of as a  disease.  My grandmother   s sister, Ollie Nunemaker, had married Watkins and  moved away, and she was the other big family resource and local  resource. Once they got the mail up and running, you could mail a  postcard to Aunt Ollie on Monday, she   d get it on Tuesday, she   d pack  her bags and get on the train on Wednesday. They always arranged  ahead when you needed her which train she   d be coming on. So,  Grandfather would take the horses down to the depot in Okarche on  Wednesday and pick her up. And that   s better train service and mail  service than I could get today  (Laughs)  Everybody out here was at the mercy of the weather. You were at the  mercy of the rain, the wind, the lack of rain, and we tend to have  droughts here about every seventeen to twenty-three years. So, you need  to plan ahead a little bit and save your money. Save your money very  much because the only people who   ve lasted out here were people who  had their land paid for and had a little bit put by so that they could get  over the bad years. It was a very stressful life because a dark cloud in  one end of the county meant maybe they had hail and your wheat would  go down and it wouldn   t come back up. Maybe that meant a cyclone or  12  maybe it meant just rain, just frog-stomping, thunderous rain, but it  wasn   t going to come back. So, it was a stressful life.  Most people had two or three ways of making a living. Two or three  crops or animals they raised or something like that because if one got  beat down, then they could have another one. Grandfather raised Turkey  Red wheat. Turkey Red had come with the Russians and with the  Norwegians and had come to the Dakotas. Turkey Red was important  because until then, the wheats that were raised out here were summer  wheats and the summer wheat wasn   t dependable. Weather was bad,  season too short, they lost most of them. But when the Russians brought  this Turkey Red, it was a winter wheat. You plant it in the fall and then  you harvest it in the spring or in the early summer. So, it came around  and it grew all winter. If everything   s good, you   ve got wheat up and  you can pasture your cattle on that wheat. So, you   ve got two crops out  of it. And then you would harvest it again in the spring. Turkey Red was  so popular that a lot of the calico fabric was called Turkey Red. You will  find quilts made from Turkey Red fabric. But it saved the American  agriculture and opened up this whole middle of the section.  A little bit later, my grandfather used Early Triumph wheat and it was a  very good, hardy wheat. It could take a heavy  rain  storm and stand  back up, didn   t require much in the way of fertilizer. It didn   t get mold  or mildew very much, but it didn   t produce a lot. So, now they   ve gone  to all these crossbreeds and hybrids, mostly bred out of OSU by a man  named Joe Danne. Joe Danne lived in a little, tiny cabin out here, very  close and he began to breed wheat seeds on his own. Have you heard  about him? Oh  Well, look him up at OSU because all his seeds went to  OSU, and he bred seeds and worked at it for thirty, forty years. When he  died, he had everything labeled in all these little vials and sometimes  there would be one or two seeds. And the modern, local wheat is all  refined versions of what he got started out here. But his wheat went to  OSU.  Let   s see. Water was extremely important and hard to come by. Some  wells worked and some wells didn   t. I   m coming to the area here where  things become a little bit disconnected. During the Depression, during  the Dust Bowl, our well did not go dry. We were one of the few who had  good, dependable water. They would have to carry water to the garden,  so they did manage to have a little bit of garden. And anybody who  wanted water,    Come take what you want. Have what you want.     Grandfather never charged a penny, always gave his water free, and he  didn   t know whether his well was going to hold out or not. Here   s Mrs.  Coffee across the road who needs water, how could you tell her no? Or  Mr. Alig down the road or how could you tell people they couldn   t have  your water?  13  I do remember them talking about during World War I that they did give  a goodbye dinner for the soldiers who were leaving here, because the  army recruited and then the train came one day and everybody came to  town to say goodbye to them. So, they had a goodbye dinner for all the  soldiers. And I believe it was Mrs. Allbough who just cried hysterically  about her son and he did come home. But everybody came to town that  day and said goodbye to all the soldiers. And then as young men were  killed and the bodies came home, everybody stopped work, got dressed,  came to town to welcome them home. They knew when World War I  was over because they could hear this incredible cacophony of sounds  from Fort Reno. They could hear the guns from Fort Reno, which were  all going off. Fort Reno was a re-mount station. Fort Reno supplied the  horses for Custer to go west on, they provided horses for World War I.  And do you remember the horse, Black Jack, who was in the Kennedy  Funeral with the boots turned backward? He was raised out there, too.  It   s been recently repossessed from OSU. (Laughs) Everybody   s  working really hard to make it a nice place again.  Let me go back here. There were other things that stressed women. Oh,  let me go back to my grandmother, the schoolteacher. I got a long way  away from her. She homesteaded by herself, got a lottery and  homesteaded by herself out in Day County, which is now Ellis County.  She and one of her younger brothers, Ira Nunemaker, or Oran, O-R-A-N,  Nunemaker, fondly known as Uncle Irie and Uncle Orn, would go with  her to help her homestead, because it wasn   t safe for her to go out there  by herself. After she married, they would spend half a year here in  Okarche and half a year out in Day County. They had to cross part of the  Great Salt Plains to get out there, so they would always stop and gather  salt. And I never quite understood that, because salt was cheap. They  could buy salt here. They stopped and gathered salt. I don   t know why.  But it was really ugly out there and it was much worse than it was here.  It was hard to make a living. The land was more barren. So, eventually  they sold it and bought the place next door to the farm that I   m farming  now, and my sister has that. We call it the East Place, but it wasn   t.  (Laughs) It   s the west quarter of that, and I didn   t write it down here. I  have to find that out. But it was very, very lonely there. And I found the  title when they took title to the homestead, the East Place, and they took  that title from a woman homesteader. There was a woman homesteader,  Wilky, Caroline Wilky, I think. She farmed right next door. And there  were two other women homesteaders in this township that I knew about.  One was part of the Grellner family, Jim Grellner, who works out at the  elevator now. It was one of his relatives. And then one of the  Scheirmans at Omega. That   s four women in this township that I know  about who homesteaded by themselves and there may have been more.  14  There were a lot more women homesteading than we realized.  But when they took title to this farm, she took title in her name. I don   t  know how she managed to do that, because she was a married woman  and she was a chattel under the law. But the title is in her name, Zora  Nunemaker McKemy, and I never understood. When she died, my  mother and Aunt Faye, Mother and her sister, Faye, took title in their  names together. Husbands were not added. And when they put it in our  names, they insisted so definitely that that was their farm. We were not  to have husbands on it, that that was the family farm. It must   ve  originated from Grandmother taking title to that homestead in her own  name. Women homesteaded and had their own property. Women got a  better deal, generally, on the frontier because there were so few women,  especially pretty women, that they could cut a better deal than they could  cut back East. And I think some of them did.  Life was really, really strenuous. Life was scary. Fire was a terrible  danger here because with the dry conditions and the wind, a forty-mile-an-  hour wind. If a fire got started, it just raged over these prairies at  forty miles an hour. So, Grandfather always kept a fire break around the  house and the buildings. When a fire broke out, he would bring the  horses or the mules up and he would hitch the wagon. He would load the  wagon with Grandmother and then with blankets and anything and get  her ready if she had to flee. And then he would take the most dependable  of the horses, the two horses were Frank and Gyp, but he would take the  most dependable and he would go to fight the fire, wherever it was. He  would take two gunny sacks and then two two-gallon bottles of water  slung on either side of the saddle and would go to fight the fire.  I can remember even a fire out here that just blew up one time in the     50s when I was a kid and everybody came running, running to fight it.  But they   re hard to get stopped, so I didn   t always understand exactly  how a fire break would work here because the weather was so hot, so  dry, and the wind is so bad it always seemed to me that it would have  jumped a fire break. But they did have them anyway, and my mother   had  some very early memories of   and Aunt Faye could, too   of  sleeping in that wagon with blankets over them and quilts beside them in  case they had to run. That must   ve been a terrifying thing.  I think living out here, in many ways, women had a better deal, but they  were still at the mercy of the weather and they were at the mercy of their  own fertility. And they didn   t have much in the way of birth control.  There was a little birth control, but not very much. They had vinegar  douches, they had condoms. And men generally did not want to use  condoms, as I think Ben Franklin said   wasn   t it Ben Franklin who said  they were    an armor against pleasure and a sieve against disease.   ? So,  15  the only other thing they could do is say,    Tell Jake to sleep on the  roof,    meaning no sex. Withdrawal was practiced, too, but not much. I  can remember my mother, who did not believe in birth control pills,  describing this little thing that her mother used, a little douche thing that  they used, a vinegar douche. Mother was so very frank sometimes.  (Laughs) But if you could get her to talking, she would talk about those.  But that was about all they had and most people had very large families  out here. Even into the    60s, I remember families of twelve to fifteen.  Oh, you need to know about Okarche also  Okarche has the distinction,  this town has three school districts. It has the public school, the Catholic  school, and the Lutheran school. Catholic families always tend to be a  little bit larger. They would have the fifteen-child families while a lot of  the protestants had smaller families, but nobody practiced birth control  much. You wash one day a week, on a Monday, which I described. You  took a bath once a week, if you were lucky. (Laughs) And you   d heat the  copper pot, which you did the laundry in. A lot of people brought it into  the common room and that   s where you took your bath. You   d heat the  water for it once a week, Saturday night. The babies went first, then the  women, then the men, all in the same water, which they added to. And I  never quite   sometimes they   d use one of the round galvanized tubs.  But I never quite understood how it worked out because you got sewn  into your underwear in October, your long johns, got sewn into them in  October, and you got cut out in the spring. So, I guess you didn   t get a  bath all winter long. I   m not sure about that. I just didn   t get that.  Oh, and a lot people wore something called asfidity and I have no idea  what it really was. I think it really was asafetida, but asfidity, and it was  a little cake and you wore it around your neck. It smelled terrible and it  was supposed to ward off germs. Who knows? But Daddy I remember  talking about the boys   and Grandmother would even talk about the  boys   throwing the asfidity in the stove so they   d get the day out of  school because then it   d smell so bad they would have to leave. (Laughs)  Grandmother taught at this little school. Grandmother taught Dolly Jung.  Dolly Jung was Mrs. Lum Jung, Mrs. Columbus Jung. I don   t know  what her maiden name was. So, then she taught my mother and Faye,  and my Aunt Faye then taught her daughters. My sister and I just totally  messed the whole thing up, but by then the school was long gone. This  school was the center of the community. They had always had a program  on Friday afternoons and the parents could come. They also had a  program for every one of the holidays. And I have a picture someplace  of the Columbus Day celebration with the hats and the flags.  Grandmother was in a beautiful, black two-piece suit, long dress, and all  of her brothers and sisters were there, and the Coffee kids and the Aligs  and the Rothers were doing that one. But they also did the Christmas  16  program. They did a New Year   s program. They had box socials there,  they had parties there, and they were supposed to have had dances there,  but I don   t quite understand how they did dances because the desks were  nailed down. So, I don   t know how that worked out, but they did have a  lot of dances out here.  Oh, every day you had to get up and you had to get a fire started in the  kitchen because you did most of your cooking in the morning. They had  breakfast, dinner, and supper. They did this cooking in the morning with  a hot fire because it was so hot the rest of the day. And they would make  iced tea, and they would put iced tea down in the well. If you kept it  down in the well, it was cool so you could have iced tea during the day.  The hot, dry wind seems to have bothered women the most. A lot of  women committed suicide. I know four who committed suicide and one  man who murdered his mother. Some of them are known and some  aren   t. The man who murdered his mother was all over the newspapers.  It was the King family, and Mrs. King knew there was something very  wrong with him. The wind was blowing, it was hot and dry, and she sent  the girls to get help. By the time they got back, he had murdered her and  then he swallowed carbolic acid. Carbolic acid is a disinfectant,  somewhat like Clorox would be today. So, he died a truly horrible death.  It just burned everything out and down.  One of my aunts on the other side of the family burned herself up in a  haystack. Simply couldn   t take the wind and the dryness and the  loneliness anymore, and she burned herself up in a haystack. That was a  popular way of doing it. Women didn   t seem to shoot themselves, didn   t  seem to slit their wrists, they seemed to do fairly dramatic things. But it  was just a hard, hard life. But then, you know, everything is a perception  because what looks like this horrible hard life to us, to them was such a  miracle. They had a free farm, they had all this technology, new farm  equipment. They had stoves to cook in. Stoves were a miracle  That was  so much better than an open hearth or a fire or working over a fire  outside. So, they thought things were a lot better than we think when we  look back.  Irons. It   s so hard. We lose track of why things were important. I was  watching a television program one time and the woman talked about the  vanity of Victorian women, even on the western march, even people on  farms, that they always had to have an iron. Some families    iron had  floated down the river, and it was a terrible, terrible problem to them.  They had to borrow it from  someone . And I just wanted to throw  things at the TV and say,    Oh, no. That iron was a terribly important part  of their lives,    because when women had periods, they used rags. There  was an expression,    So and so was so poor, he couldn   t keep them in  rags.    And these rags were all put in a pot where they were sterilized and  17  Finchum  K. Lewis  then they were kept and used over and over and over. And they were  washed and then they were ironed. And they didn   t know much about  sanitation, but they knew to iron those rags and they ironed diapers. The  calico fabric was really rough and hard and very abrasive. So, if you   re  stuck out here and that   s all the fabric you have, you need to iron it. It   s  a matter of comfort, not a matter of vanity. And I   m sure this young  historian had never heard women talk about struggling with some of  these necessities of life. And everybody always had a baby. You were  either pregnant or lactating, so you always had a baby. You always had  diapers, if not rags.  Oh, my great-grandparents, on their homestead, they planted a hedge of  bodark trees. Have you ever heard of bodark trees?  Yes.  Okay. They   re in bloom now. And he had this beautiful hedge of these  beautiful trees and it protected the house. But it sometimes hung over  into the road and the horses would get them. It   s all gone now, which I  miss. I always looked forward to that.  In 1912, all the community got together and they brought telephones in  and they had Pioneer Telephone Company. Our ring was two shorts and  a long. You, of course, rang it, and you got a whole party line. But in  many ways it was the early keep-track-of-your-children because you  could give the general alarm and Grandmother could say,    Has anybody  seen the girls?    And anybody would say,    Oh, yes. They   re here or  there.    And then,    Where   s so and so? Is he out in this field, or is he out  in that field?    So, it was an early Meghan   s Law. (Laughs) You can  track anybody with those. In 1962 they had sold it, and they had put in  fifty dollars and they got fifty dollars back. I can remember my mother  and Aunt Faye coming down to OU and they had kept, each kept one  quarter of the fifty dollars. So, they brought me my  12.50 and they  brought my sister her  12.50, and we all had a lovely lunch and laughed  and reminisced about the old days. My sister has the phone.  Everybody had a pie shell and they had a signature on their pie shell out  here so that you could know whose pie that was if you went to a church  supper or if you went to a box supper or whatever. And our signature  was kind of a long S and it had a little quote on this side and a quote on  this side. I   ve forgotten what the others were, but everybody had a  special way of cutting the top dough for a pie so that you knew whose  pie was whose. Grandmother had her own special recipe for peach pie,  and it has come down in the family and we all make it. In October when  my cousin, Charlotte, came to visit she said,    Do you still have your  grandmother   s peach pie recipe?    and I do and I gave it to her and went  18  back to the rest of the family. But they made pies out of the peaches,  they made pies out   oh, and she had made up the recipe herself. She  developed it from something else. They made pies out of peaches, out of  apples, out of the dried fruit that they could buy or that they could dry  themselves. They made jam with peaches, apples. There was a grape  arbor not too far away. They made jam with sand plums. Omega was the  sand plum center. Omega kind of sits on a sand mound and these grow  sand plums. They   re so sour you can   t eat them, but they make the most  wonderful, wonderful plums. The only trouble is sand plums are infected  with chiggers. So, if you go after sand plums, you better take a bath and  wash your clothes within about an hour or you   re going to be miserable  for the next month or two.  Meals were breakfast, dinner, and supper. They had pies for breakfast,  they had oatmeal, they had eggs in season. I don   t know what they had  for the main meal of the day. It   s escaped me, I don   t remember. But  dinner was leftovers from whatever they   d had before. Milk and bread  was a very popular dinner. It was a very popular meal. A lot of people  ate milk and bread with a piece of fruit or some dried fruit or some  canned things. Once in a while they had chicken, goose, turkey, or  whatever they could shoot, but not very often. You didn   t want to use up  your chickens. You might need them in the wintertime or you might  need them for eggs. So, people talk about this   oh, all that wonderful,  fresh food they must   ve had. No, they didn   t have much fresh food. It  was mostly carbohydrates. It was mostly bread. It was mostly milk,  cream, butter. And then in the spring and early summer you would have  some fresh food. But then you would harvest your green beans and your  lima beans and things of that nature and can them. And canning was a  terrible project. You put the copper pot out over the hot fire outside and  you cooked your vegetables and your meats for hours and hours. I think  it was six hours for meat, potatoes, and carrots. That was wonderful  when it came out, even at that with that number of hours. There was no  pressure canning.  Okay, when the family lived out here everybody went to church, and  you went to church on Sunday. And then you had a big Sunday dinner.  You came to town once a month. And town usually for my family meant  coming to Okarche. If you had to go to the doctor you would drive to  Okarche, take the train to Kingfisher. If you had to see the dentist, you  would take the train to Kingfisher because that was too far. That  would   ve been forty miles in one day and the horses couldn   t pull that  far. If you can imagine anything more unpleasant than having to ride in  that wagon in the sun or the wind or the snow... If it were cold, they  would heat stones or potatoes and put them in their pockets. If it were  hot, they were just miserable.  19  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  Horses would walk two or three or four miles an hour. It was ten miles  to town  Horses were slow, mules were slow. (Laughs) Horses had a  tendency to stop on the road. They would stop and urinate and they got  rid of six to nine gallons   ?  Something like that.  Yes, six to nine gallons a day. And you   re sitting in a wagon and the  wind is blowing forty miles an hour. And if you   re in the wrong   direction , downwind, it was a very unpleasant trip to town. (Laughs) I  think that   s one reason why cars are so important, why people would  struggle and struggle and struggle to have cars. Model Ts were terribly  important out here because you could do so many things with a Model  T. My daddy said Model Ts were cussed mean to start, cussed mean to  run, cussed mean standing still and he didn   t say    cussed.    And he  knew. He knew. (Laughs)  Mother and Faye walked to Fairview School and they would try to take  one of the horses, Frank or Gyp, but Frank or Gyp couldn   t be spared all  day from the farm work. So, they would chase him down the road and he  was supposed to go home. But lots of times they didn   t go home, lots of  times the horses would go into the Coffee   s barn and get a little snack.  So, eventually the girls had to walk by themselves, and they walked two  miles to Fairview School and two miles back. The well head is still there  and the school building is over on Jud Stroud   s place. So, the school  building still exists, but the school does not.  Let   s see. Mother didn   t start school until she was eight and Faye was  four because it was so far for these two little girls to walk and  Grandmother was not trusting the Cheyenne. (Laughs) She never got  over that. Because Grandmother was educated, she was incredibly  determined that her little girls would be educated too and would have a  college education like she had. So, she made it a point of starting to save  for those girls    education while they were still very small, a pattern  which my mother started also. The day we were born, each of us   they  began to buy war bonds for us and continued buying bonds or putting  money away. Both of my parents were incredibly determined that we  have educations, so it goes down. Grandfather would give them a calf  every year, and they would raise that calf and then they   d sell the calf  and they   d save the money. They took piano lessons from the King  family, from, I think, Zella King. Zella was one of the other school  teachers out here. They took piano lessons from her and then they gave  piano lessons, all to earn money to go to college. They raised chickens  and eggs. Okarche eventually got a creamery and that was a big miracle  because now you had a way to milk you cows and to take the butter, the  milk, the cream to town and sell it. So, they did that and they saved  20  forever.  They finally saved for a year at Central State College in Edmond, which  had been the old Normal School. So, they had a year in Edmond and  they lived with Mrs. Kidd, the Methodist minister and his wife in  Edmond, and they lived with her. So, they got a year   s education. After  that, they would teach school for the school year. Then they would go to  Edmond in the summer, and Edmond had two summer courses. They  would get there three weeks late for the first one and make that work up  and get the credit for twelve weeks. Then they would take whatever they  could in the way of correspondence courses at home. Both of them  graduated and my grandmother was so proud of that. I guess they were,  too, because the latter years when they were going to school was the  middle of the Depression and there was no way. People would talk about  P.C. McKemy. What was the matter with him sending those girls to  school? Why, he could buy a good farm for what he was spending on  those girls    education. But he spent it and Grandmother spent it, and  they worked hard to keep those girls in school.  Mother taught both at Big Four, which was one of the schools here,  which was a consolidated school, four districts. She taught at Loyal and  she taught at Omega. Grandfather would always go and bring the girls  home for the weekends if he could. But Omega was very important  because that was where she met my daddy. Both of them taught school  until the year in the Depression when Oklahoma could not pay their  teachers. There was not enough tax money. We tax and spend, and tax  and spend. Well, they couldn   t collect any taxes. There was no income.  There were no taxes. The land was blowing away. You couldn   t collect  property taxes. So, one year, Mother did have to pay the taxes on the  farm, but my grandparents paid her back.  So, Mother graduated in History and English. Faye graduated in Home  Economics. So, after Mother could not  teach because  the state couldn   t  pay them and it took several months before their pay dribbled in. A lot  of the banks discounted those warrants. Not this bank. This bank paid  them. (Laughs) Against my husband   s wishes, I   m transferring some of  my money from California right into this Okarche bank because it held  in the Depression, and it   s the same family with the same attitude with  the same money. And I think my money is probably safer here than it is  in California.  Mother became a comptometer operator. That was sort of an early, fancy  adding machine. And Faye went back to school at OSU and got some  graduate courses and became a home economist with the county agent.  She was head of the top county in the nation twice, Garfield County, and  was in the Home Economist Hall of Fame in Washington.  21  Finchum  K. Lewis  The Depression was truly horrible. I hope Ken Burns can transmit the  horror of it. Now, this is not the land that was plowed that shouldn   t  have been. That was a little farther west in the Oklahoma Panhandle, the  Texas Panhandle, a little into Colorado. Woodrow Wilson had come  home from World War I and he had seen the farming practices in  Europe, and he didn   t know anything about the West, but he thought,     We have all that land that   s just cattle land. We should put that to  farming.    So, he arranged with Congress to pay a bounty, and I think it  was a dollar an acre if you would tear up your land to plant crops, which  might not have been so bad but it happened in conjunction with a five-hundred  year drought or a thousand year drought. All of the sudden, that  land was blowing away, that fine silt, so that even here it began   which  generally we didn   t have any problem   this land began to blow away.  And if you had a dust storm, if it were red you   d say,    Oh, there goes  Oklahoma.    If it   s yellow,    Oh, there goes Texas.    (Laughs) If it was  brown,    Oh, there goes Colorado.    But we do have these cyclical  droughts. Eventually the Depression was over, the Dust Bowl was over  and they began to farm it again and irrigate it. Now, the irrigation wells  have gone dry and the Ogallala water   what do you call it?  Aquifer.  Aquifer, thank you. That   s a problem with getting older. The Ogallala  Aquifer now is receding, and it may only last twenty or thirty more  years. So, there   s a lot of the water wells can   t get down in there and that  land has turned back into grazing land. Here, we generally don   t irrigate.  We usually get enough, thirty-some odd inches a year. But when it   s a  drought it is a drought and that   s that. It blows away here, too. It was so  horrible here that when a dust storm came up, if Grandfather were in the  fields, Mother and Faye would take the car. They bought a Model T in  1920. They would take the car and they would tie one of them to the car  with a rope and they would go down the fence row. The one walking  would go down the fence row, and they   d turn on the lights of the car  and honk and honk and honk until he could find them and come up to  the fence row with the horse. And then they would all go back to the  house.  It was terrifying. You couldn   t see anything. The wind was blowing  everything away. You didn   t have any food. Water wells were drying  up. Your neighbors were leaving. And this wind howled and howled and  howled. And they put sheets at the window and still there was this haze  of dust, terrible haze of dust. They would put extra sheets and blankets  on the bed, but still at night when you   d turn the covers back, the silica  in the beds. You kept the plates turned over. You didn   t turn them up  until the last minute because within thirty seconds you had dust, silica.  22  You ate it, you breathed it, you lived with it. If you were cooking, you  kept a lid on your food or you   d have this fine film of dust.  A lot of people had what they called dust pneumonia. They breathed it in  so badly that they coughed and coughed and breathed it in and coughed.  A lot of people died of dust pneumonia. My daddy had dust pneumonia  because he was out in it a lot. He had dust pneumonia and it took it sixty  years to kill him. He was hail and hardy and young enough, but he  always had lung trouble and allergies. When he died there was a very  young doctor, and my sister and I were trying to tell him he had lung  trouble, that he had dust pneumonia. This was a young doctor who knew  nothing about the Depression or the Dust Bowl, so he put down    cardiac  insufficiency.    No, he didn   t have cardiac insufficiency. His lungs  finally wore out and then I suppose his heart wore out from the trying to  breathe. It finally got so bad that my grandparents did leave in 1936.  Faye had gotten a job in Madill and she was the home demonstration  agent there. Madill is far enough east and south that it wasn   t as bad  there, so they went to live with her. Then they went on to live in Enid,  which was Garfield County with her where she was so successful.  I should go back to the Nunemakers a minute. They farmed and he  preached, and then he was kicked in the head by a horse in the    20s and  eventually had a stroke or died of the effects of that. She had ovarian  cancer and died. Their homestead in Park Township was divided  amongst the children and my grandmother saved her money and never  spent it. (Laughs) So, then I should take you, I think, over to my daddy  who was at Omega. He lived in town and lived a somewhat different  life. He was E.O., Earnest Otto, and everybody called him Doc Brandes,  B-R-A-N-D-E-S. He was also known as Putze, P-U-T-Z-E, which means     little darling.    There were huge numbers of Germans at Omega, and he  spoke German until he was five years old and Putze was a common  German childhood diminutive for little boys. He was born in Omega in  Omega Township and Grandfather, Dr. Brandes, said that he was born  during this howling horrible March storm and that he just simply never  quit howling.  His mother was Isabelle Wenzel and his father was Ed Hahn. But they  had very hard times, so they let Dr. Brandes and Mrs. Brandes adopt  him. They had a son of their own, Herman, who was also a doctor.  Herman studied at Epworth Methodist College, Medical School, in  Oklahoma City, which is taken over by OU and he also then studied at  OU. There   s this horrific picture of this single little light bulb and he   s in  anatomy class with the other students and there   s a cadaver, and they   re  digging away at this cadaver with their bare hands. I think that killed a  lot of doctors, digging away at cadavers with bare hands.  23  Dr. Brandes was Dr. Carl Gustav and Mrs. Brandes was Emma Meullen  Brandes. They came from Germany and they came first to Canada, then  to the Pennsylvania coal fields, which were just horrible, very lawless.  She would sit with a gun every night until he got home. Then they came  to Okarche and then on to Omega. In those days, Omega was really a  pretty nice little town. Omega was five miles from Alpha, the Alpha and  Omega. (Laughs) And Alpha is totally gone now. Omega has a little bit  left, and they just had a wonderful reunion at the school and they   ve put  out a reunion book. If that   s something that you would be interested in I  will try to get a copy because they go all the way back with pictures and  diagrams and things like that. They   re putting out an addendum soon  because they found so many people through this who also have artifacts.  The Brandeses adopted Daddy and then they helped Grandmother  become a nurse. She was in nursing school in 1906,    07. I think she got  her degree in 1907, and she was a nurse in Oklahoma City at Wesley  Hospital. She worked so hard because the Brandeses didn   t have enough  to help her do everything, so she worked hard. She would shave and  bathe patients to make extra money because her shoes wore out. The  hospital administrators, in their infinite wisdom, would stack her patients  up on three or four floors instead of putting them all on one floor. She  spent her time climbing the stairs from one floor to another and her  shoes would wear out.  Grandmother had a thing about shoes because they had homesteaded and  they really, truly were very, very poor. Her parents were very poor. The  first shoes that any of the kids had, they picked blackberries   it was in  the 1880s   they picked blackberries and sold these pails of blackberries  to have shoes and they didn   t fit very well. Grandmother would walk all  the way to church, she   d take a washcloth with her. Before she turned  the last corner, she   d wash off her feet, put her shoes on, go to church.  And then she would come back to that corner, get the washcloth off the  fence, take her shoes off, and walk home. And those shoes lasted for  years.  Once Grandmother graduated, she  worked  at a hospital in El Reno. She  worked at Fort Reno and she was there in 1907 during statehood. I  remember her talking about the different operations, which were pretty  grim in those days. But there was one woman out there trying to give  birth, and she had to give birth before midnight the day that Oklahoma  became a state because she was part Indian and could get head rights. If  he wasn   t   the baby wasn   t born until after midnight, that baby wasn   t  going to get head rights. He didn   t get head rights. But she used to  describe in fairly graphic detail some of the wounds that would come in  and some of the things that they did. And it was really pretty  awful .  Medicine was in its infancy. But there again, it   s all a matter of  24  perception. That was a miracle compared to what they had had twenty-five  years before. There was medical care. They could set bones.  Women began to live with the anesthetics and practicing sanitation in  child birth. I think in Queen Victoria   s time, something like 90 percent  of women died in childbirth. Not the first one, maybe the fifteenth one.  But just a simple thing like a bladder infection would kill women. And  all they could do was just drink water for it. That was just it. But bladder  infections moved into the kidneys, and the kidney infections would  eventually kill you. So, what we look at as something pretty awful,  pretty grim, it was, again, a real miracle from their eyes.  After she left Fort Reno she came back to Oklahoma City and worked at  Wesley Hospital and then she became the head nurse at the Infectious  Diseases Hospital. Do you have any idea what that was? Well, it was a  confinement, containment, quarantine hospital. If you had Tuberculosis,  if you had Small Pox, if you had Yellow Fever, Malaria   Malaria was  very, very bad here. Now, while malaria wasn   t contagious, I think it  was handled there. But if you had any of those diseases you went to the  quarantine hospital. You couldn   t stay in a regular hospital. Regular  hospitals were for operations and having babies and things of that   or  broken bones and you didn   t want to have a broken bone. (Laughs) You  really didn   t want to have a broken bone. But she handled that. And she  must   ve had the most incredible, incredible immune system. Daddy had  an incredible immune system because he never got anything. I mean, he  never even had measles or mumps and she didn   t either. Daddy lived in  the Brandes home where sick people came all the time because Dr.  Brandes    office was in the home. So, there was this continual parade of  sick people and he never got anything, not a thing.  Daddy was just as cute as he could be. There   s some pictures. He   s just  the cutest little kid. And you know how people in these old pictures just  look stern and like this, here   s this cute little kid with this glint in his  eye. He had pale blond hair, which eventually turned black. So, he had  black eyes, black hair, and this dark, swarthy skin and then he got me.  Not what you expect  (Laughs) But I have a Caddo cousin whose mother  was just about the same coloring that Daddy was and she had a little red-headed  son and two little red-headed grandsons. We were real glad to  see them because people would look at Sharee and me and it was like,     Oh, are those your little girls?    Yes, we were. Momma was red-headed  and we took after her. (Laughs) He was also just quite a handful. He was  a little stinker. I mean, he was always running around doing something.  He was just always all-boy.  I remember in an interview he did with Penn Whittington at probably  Oklahoma Christian College, he talked about the chores he had to do  because he had to bring the kindling in and he had to go downtown. You  25  Finchum  K. Lewis  really wanted to get down to the stores in Omega after they got their  deliveries because they   d have these crates out back and then cut those  crates up for kindling. Otherwise, you were chopping wood all week for  the woodstoves. Most everybody heated with these horrible woodstoves.  But again, that was a pretty important thing to them. They used coal oil  lamps, which we would call kerosene lamps and they were extremely  dangerous. The first Brandes home at Omega burned from a coal oil  lamp exploding, which they did. If a wick falls into it, which happens,  the lamp explodes. And I mean fire is just thrown around. They built a  second lovely two story-home that was just demolished a few years ago.  Daddy did lots of pranks  Small towns didn   t have much to do, so you  had to make your own fun and Daddy made a lot of fun. (Laughs) He  and some kids   Omega had lots of activities. They had a band, they had  a choir, and like Okarche and Altona, they had literary societies, they  had singing societies, they had card societies. Especially with  Grandmother Zora, there were a lot of literary societies and literary  things going on. The Ladies  Aide Society  happened to have a  bandstand, and Daddy and some kids cut this bandstand in half one year  and hauled it out into the road. Took a team of horses to haul it back.  (Laughs) They   d turn over people   s outhouses and everybody knew who  was doing it. They knew who was doing it. (Laughs)  Daddy got a Model T about 1915 when he was fifteen years old. He had  worked in the harvest fields and he was pretty big and strong and husky.  And at age twelve, he started working in the harvest fields. The farmer  didn   t want to hire him. He said,    Look, I   ll work today. If I   m not  satisfactory, you don   t have to pay me.    Well, he was very satisfactory,  so he worked very hard, the harvest and planting, and then he bought his  first Model T. He and his friends would drive up to a farmer   s house in  the middle of the night, bang on the door, and say,    Do you have a        whatever it is      a mower or a hayer or something?    And then they   d  say,    That   s a really good thing to have,    and they   d run out the door  and run away. One day, the Model T died and here comes the farmer.  And I guess he kind of whomped on them a little bit. (Laughs) That lost  its attractiveness. I can remember two old jokes he would tell, and they  are old jokes. Are you into jokes?  Sure, why not?  Well, once upon a time, they had this wonderful corn crop. It was just a  fabulous corn crop. And they had this huge, big ear of corn. It was so big  they couldn   t get it out of the fields, so they had to turn the pigs in to the  field to eat on this monstrous ear of corn. Well, the pigs ate all down one  side of that ear of corn and it destabilized it and it just rolled over on  those pigs and crushed them. That was Omega jokes. His other joke that  26  Bill Lewis  K. Lewis  I can remember was the wind was so bad here. So, how do you know it   s  safe to go out in the wind? Well, you take a lead pipe and you stick it up  to the stove hole and if it only bends halfway, safe to go outside. Omega  jokes. They also did other things. They had this wonderful baseball  team, and one day old man Webber gave the general alarm and said,     I   m down in the well. I   m drowning. You   ve got to come get me.    So,  of course, it broke up the baseball game. Everybody goes rushing to see  about him in the well and there he is, sitting on the back stoop laughing  at them. They played jokes, they played tricks, because they had to make  their own fun.  Omega had schools, churches, stores, bandstand, band, baseball team, all  kinds of clubs. From a very early age, Daddy drove for Dr. Brandes. Dr.  Brandes never got a car down and he literally went through the barn  twice, yelling,    Whoa     So, after that, Daddy drove for him. He insisted  that he was only three or four years old when he stood between Dr.  Brandes    legs and steered this car. And I always kind of doubted   oh,  and that he was ten when he really began driving and doing the driving  for him. That sounds kind of far-fetched, but are you familiar with the  Abernathy boys from Frederick? Well, Bud and I can   t remember the  other name, his brother, drove a Brush automobile from Washington,  D.C. to Oklahoma City. And I   m sure it was a stunt because their father  and a chauffeur drove behind them in a Maxwell. But this Brush  automobile probably wasn   t even longer than this table. (Gestures) They  were six and ten and both of them lived in Frederick. One of them grew  up to be an oil man, one grew up to be a judge. And their father was     Bring    em Back Alive    Jack Abernathy. He would go after coyotes and  wolves,    Wolf Man    Jack Abernathy, and he would jam his fist into  these wolves or coyotes and bring them back alive and then sell them.  He   d been a rough rider with Teddy Roosevelt.  These kids, their first attempt at notoriety was riding their horse all by  themselves to Washington and then they drove this car home. There is a  museum to the Abernathy boys at Frederick. You can Google it. There  are a couple of books about them. So, maybe my daddy really was  driving for Dr. Brandes at age ten. He got his first Model T at age fifteen  and he was a wonderful mechanic, a fabulous mechanic. He could fix  anything. In his later life, his greatest joy was what we call the Horseless  Carriage Club. That   s a group of people who drive automobiles earlier  than 1915. And to my poor husband   s great dismay   Daddy collected  cars   he left us a 1909 Rambler, which is   what would you call it,  Dear?  A money pit. (Laughter)  It   s worse than a money pit, isn   t it? It really is  (Laughs) And he left my  27  sister the little Maxwell because she could crank it. But we got the big  Rambler because my husband could crank it and Mother got a Selden.  George Selden had a patent on automobiles that Henry Ford finally  broke in 1910. My sister   s Maxwell is a 1908 and there are still people  who remember. Daddy always brought the Maxwell or the Rambler     mine   s a 1909   up to all the parades and everything for years. A man  stopped me on the fiftieth wedding  anniversary  last week and said,     Oh, I remember your dad. He   d always come to the parades.    And he  did. What may happen to my Rambler? (Laughter) It   s hard to drive and  we did the one thing that my daddy would have so objected to. We put a  starter on it. So, I can feel him thumping me on the head because he  cranked it all those years and would   ve expected us to crank it. But we  are not what he was. We are not. We can   t do it.  Now, he loved racing cars. He raced Model Ts. And I think one  reason   he hated Model Ts so much. He was driving in the old days and  he had broken his arm so often from cranking it that he had this bone  that didn   t heal. It wouldn   t heal anymore. And he had a place on the  back of his head   it ran over him one time and dragged him for a ways.  He had this little bald place on the back of his head. A couple of his toes  weren   t quite right because it had run over him another time. No wonder  he called them what he did  But he loved those Model Ts and he raced  them and he had a wonderful, wonderful time out here.  He always said   if you asked him where he was from, he was from the  C and A country, which meant he was from the Cheyenne-Arapaho  country. Other people were from the Outlet, or other people were from  Old Oklahoma. So, in the early days everybody identified themselves  where they were from. He was too young for World War I, too old for  World War II. Dr. Brandes, older Dr. Brandes, and Herman were the  doctors at Omega. Herman had a pharmacy degree also, so they  dispensed drugs. Herman had broken his back in Canada, so he was  somewhat hunched and couldn   t breathe very well. When World War I  came along, he enlisted as a doctor and they sent him to San Antonio.  And how the army took this man who really was a hunchback and whose  lungs were impaired as a doctor   but they did. The 1918 flu hit and, of  course, he became ill.  Daddy and Dr. Brandes went out to visit people and they went from  house to house to house for two weeks. They didn   t go home for two  weeks. They stayed out, slept in the car, ate in the car. When Dr.  Brandes was in the house, Daddy would sleep. When Daddy was  driving, Dr. Brandes would sleep. The most they could do was clean  people up and get a meal down them. That was just  all . There were no  drugs for it. You either lived or you died. One of the   I think it was one  of the Biehlers or it was one of the Webbers came and said,    I   ll give  28  you anything. Come, come to my house now.    And they tried to explain  there was this long line ahead and they couldn   t do anything anyway.  They stayed out until somebody came and told them that Herman had  been sent home, that he was very ill with the flu, that they needed to go  home. So, they did go home. The army, in its wisdom, had shipped him  home on the train infecting how many people? And a number of other  men they shipped home to die. So, they went home and they stayed with  him until he was in a coma and there was nothing that could be done.  And then they went back out again and started treating people. They  didn   t collect for most of it. They didn   t even try to collect for most of it.  My daddy was a really, really, really good man. In 1920, Utoka Gulker  became ill with pneumonia. The Gulkers owned the bank in Omega and  eventually moved to town, to Kingfisher. At age ninety-eight, Mr.  Gulker was still working and he was the justice of the peace in  Kingfisher. (Laughs) I remember telling Bill that we could get into any  kind of trouble we wanted to get into in Kingfisher. Mr. Gulker was the  Justice of the Peace. Utoka had pneumonia and a terrible Blue Norther  came up with terrible ice and snow all over the ground. And she needed  oxygen just desperately. They could get oxygen to Kingfisher, but they  couldn   t get it out to Omega. There was no way to get it out. The storm  was too bad. Daddy was fifteen with his first Model T and he said,    I   ll  go get it.    And Dr. Brandes said,    No, don   t.    Even Mrs. Gulker came  over and said,    No, don   t. There   s no use to lose both of you.    My  daddy put a sack of sand in the trunk of that Model T, took some wire  cutters, a shovel, and a burlap bag and went cross-country to Kingfisher  and wired them from Kingfisher that he was on the way home. That kid  got back with that  oxygen  and saved her life, so the Gulkers thought he  was the most wonderful person in the world. He took a terrible chance  because he couldn   t travel the roads, so he   d go cross-country. He   d  have to put this Model  T across fields . He   d cut the fence, go across  the road, use the burlap bag and the sand to get across the road, and then  he followed his tracks home. Didn   t fix any of the fences. (Laughs) So,  he really was a nice man.  He spent a semester at Phillips University in Enid and then he went to  Chicago. He was supposed to go to school up there and he didn   t. He  worked for Westinghouse up there and he lived with a German family.  This German family had never seen a turkey so at Thanksgiving he  wired Dr. Brandes and said,    Send me a turkey.    So, they froze a turkey  outside and shipped this turkey on the railway and it got there. And these  people didn   t know what to do with it so Daddy had to show them how  to cook it. They   d never seen that much meat in their whole life, just an  Oklahoma turkey.  When the Depression came, he was running a store in Omega and he  29  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  kept it up as long as he could because Dr. Brandes had died by then.  Herman was dead. Mrs. Brandes was old and frail and he tried to keep  this store up. Remember when he told us about having to take the keys,  having to finally give up?  Yes.  And he and a friend went to Kansas City to the grocery company and  finally had to turn in the keys because people simply couldn   t pay their  bill. They would just leave and he couldn   t keep it open anymore. He  owed them a tremendous amount so he had this store and he simply went  broke. He bummed around the country for a while, quite literally  bummed around the country trying to get jobs. He rode the rails for a  while. He eventually ended up in Oklahoma City and got a job there, and  he lived on a lady   s porch for one winter. I think it was a screened in  porch, but he rented this space on an outdoor porch. He talked about if  he wanted to make tomato soup, you   d go into a restaurant and you   d  order some coffee. Then you   d grab the ketchup and the water and you   d  put them together and have some crackers. They   d always put crackers  out and that was making tomato soup for the cost of a cup of coffee.  He met my mother when she was teaching in Omega. She was teaching  at the Omega High School, which he had graduated from. When they   d  built the new school in 1928, he did all the electrical work. He was  always very proud of that new school. He and Mother dated. They went  to parties, they went to dances, they went to house parties, they played  bridge, they went to movies. One time, Mother borrowed his Model T to  go see her other boyfriend, and this guy left   Lester Hale   left his hat  in the back seat in the back of the Model T. (Laughs) Here comes Daddy  with this hat saying,    Okay, what   s this?    And she just passed it off, she  didn   t know anything, she didn   t know anything. Daddy knew pretty  well. He knew pretty well.  One time he was taking her home and they ran up on some people  butchering a cow in the road. So, they went very quickly to the George  Olegg house, grabbed George Alig and a shotgun, and tried to chase  these guys down and couldn   t. So, he was just always doing something  like that. He finally got enough money together, he and Mother got  enough money together, that they married in 1937 on September 30th,  which is her parents    anniversary. Then they went to Oklahoma City  where he had a service station at Fourth and Walnut. The service station  belongs to the Historical Society now and they   re talking about restoring  it. It   s evidently all there. But in 1942   of course, they   re still  struggling   they got a fifty dollar payment. There was an oil well down  the street and in those days, they just pulled off the house, put the oil  well on, and went on and paid all the neighbors and they got fifty  30  dollars. So, they spent that fifty dollars to move and to have a baby, me.  And if you think my Grandmother Nunemaker was surprised to get my  mother, my daddy was surprised to get me. We always laugh and say  that   s how I got K. Kay, that he thought I was worth stuttering over.  (Laughter)  The first year that I was born, it was 1942 and there were no toys in  Oklahoma City. Have any idea why there wouldn   t have been any toys  in Oklahoma City in 1942? That was the beginning of World War II.  There were no toys. Toys were not made. Cars were not made, not for  the civilians. Gasoline was rationed. Daddy had this service station at  Fourth and Walnut and there was this one doll buggy in Oklahoma City.  It was in the front of the Sears Roebuck store and Daddy went to see the  manager, Fay Hickson, and he took a bunch of gasoline coupons. We  farmed, so we got gasoline coupons to farm. The long distance truck  drivers coming through would give him gasoline coupons for the eggs  and the milk and the butter and things that he had. So, he went in to see  Fay Hickson and Fay Hickson, the manager, said,    I know what you  want, but you just can   t have it.    Daddy fanned out these gasoline  coupons.    Oh, well. Maybe you can. Maybe we can work out something  here.    (Laughs) So, he gave him the gasoline coupons to get that doll  buggy for me, but he couldn   t have it until Christmas Eve.  So, Christmas Eve comes and there   s a blinding snowstorm. So, Mother  and Daddy, taking me with them, meet Fay Hickson at God only knows  what hour of the night with this terrible blowing snowstorm to get that  doll buggy. And he brought extra gas coupons with him in case there  was a problem. And it   s a good thing he did because two young  policemen stopped them in the alleyway of Sears and Roebuck and said,     Well, what do you want? What   s going on here?    So, Daddy   s little gas  coupons mollified them and I got a doll buggy, a doll buggy that   s still  in my living room. I still have it. I have a number of family things like  that. But here they were, this young couple in the worst winter, the worst  darkness, blackness, just trying to make Christmas better for their baby  and for them, too.  Daddy kept the service station for a number of years. Then he had Doc  Brandes Auto Storage on  Fifth and Broadway . It was right down the  street from what became the Murrah Building, Sixth and Broadway.  Then he went into real estate with Mother. Mother had been teaching all  this time. She   d gone from comptometers back to teaching to  comptometers back to teaching, and they had moved to Oklahoma City.  They started the real estate company, Brandes Real Estate, which went  right down until the    90s. And I   ll jump back to Mother a minute and  explain about that. He died in 1986 of dust pneumonia. You know, both  of them, all of them were really part of what Tom Brokaw would call the  31  Finchum  K. Lewis  Greatest Generation because they faced terrible hardship out here     death, disease, no doctor, wind, sun, Depression, Dust Bowl, two wars,  the 1918 flu, and they survived and thrived and managed.  Now, the Brandeses were German and they ate sauerkraut, they ate rye  bread, they ate pickled foods, and my daddy hated pickled foods and rye  bread. They had a lot of dried vegetables and salt vegetables, but they  didn   t have access to what the McKemys had.  While your father was working the service station, what was happening  on the farm at that time?  We had   after my grandparents   that was just about what I was to get  back to. We had a series of tenants. One of the first ones was one of  Grandmother   s brothers, Uncle Ira, and then a series of others. The last  one was Leonard Jarvel. And then we took over farming it ourselves  again in the    50s. So, that meant that we would contract farm it and then  we would come out and help, which was just wonderful. I was a child of  air conditioning and electricity and help. My daddy believed in if we  girls were going to inherit this land, then we should know how it  worked. So, we would come out and help. And for all of my life, even  during my married life, if I could get home, I came home for the harvest  and for whatever else and helped. My sister usually did the planting, I  did the harvest. It was hard, hot, miserable work, even when we just sat  in the car and counted the wheat trucks. If we had to help, it was really  miserable. And at the end of the day, you   d stand under the pump and  just stand under some water and then you   d fall down and get up again  at six a.m. and work.  In those days, it was very dry here. They hadn   t built all the dams and all  the recreation and all the ponds, so it was dry here and you could work  almost twenty-four hours a day, if you could work. They needed help  with the cooking, help to take food to the fields, help with  everything .  They needed somebody to take things back and forth, somebody to  relieve on the tractor, somebody to relieve on the truck. It was horrible.  It was just horrible. The farmhouse finally did have electricity and one  of my cousins would want me to tell you what a miracle electricity was.  She told me to tell you about it. But the farmhouse never did have  running water, ever, ever, ever, never. Sometimes in California in the  middle of the winter when it   s really raining and storming, I will stand at  the sink and turn on the hot water and just watch it run for a couple of  minutes because I remember when you didn   t have water, much less hot  water. Oh, my. We are so spoiled. We are so spoiled.  We were talking to some of the kids a few years ago about  electricity .  They were saying,    Ooh, look  Only one little bulb. How awful.    Betty  32  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  Lee  Baldwin , one of the Nunemaker cousins, and I were trying to tell  them,    Oh, no. you don   t understand. That was a miracle. That forty-watt  bulb      I can remember Betty saying,    That forty-watt bulb lit up  things like day. It was unbelievable     It was safe. You didn   t have that  coal oil or kerosene smell. You didn   t have the danger of the lamp  exploding. You weren   t always dirty from the lamp black and it didn   t  discolor anything. It was as bright as day. You could go into another  room and you got light from that thing. You could close the door and  you   ve got light underneath. You could do work at night, which I   m not  so sure was a really good idea for women. I think maybe it just extended  a woman   s day. Men, they worked from sun to sun, but woman works     oh, let   s see. Women   s work is     Never done.     never done. That   s it. And I think maybe that made it worse. But for  the first time, they could see to read at night, they could see to study at  night. You could sew at night. You could come in and get something  else done. You weren   t tied by the storm that was outside that you didn   t  have any light. You didn   t have to get up at dawn and go to bed at dark.  That little forty-watt thing was a miracle. The second miracle was they  began to have crystal sets and radio. All of a sudden, instead of being  out in this remote place where you got newspapers once a week and  knew World War I was over because you heard the guns at Fort Reno.  All the sudden you could have radio. Oh my gosh, a radio  That  connected you with the whole world and it was entertainment.  Everybody could gather around and listen to it, which I   m not so sure is  such a good idea. (Laughs) Every so often we lose our power at home.  It   s kind of quiet, kind of nice for a little while until my refrigerator  starts to  thaw , but it   s kind of nice just to sit down. I can   t do anything,  there   s no electricity. Just have to sit and visit. So, but it also meant then,  you could have a little, tiny refrigerator. You didn   t have to put the tea  down the well anymore. You could put the tea in the refrigerator. As  time went on, maybe you got a little tiny thing that would make a few  ice cubes so you could have ice cream or you could go to the ice depot  in Okarche and buy ice, because they had electricity. You could make  ice cream or you could cool things off or you could put a big tub of ice  in front of the fan and have a little bit of cooling on a terrible day. Oh,  my  That little forty-watt bulb was a miracle and we look back on it as,     Gee, how could you have  that ?    It   s all perception. To them, it was a  steady improvement in their lives. To us, it   s,    Oh, really? Now.    My  cousin would   ve wanted me to tell you about that.  I used my grandmother   s English book, the book that she had used when  she was young in teaching, because the exercises for the English, for the  grammar and punctuation, were much better than the ones that I got in  33  my book. She had all these little shortcuts. Do you know how to teach     who    and    whom   ? Well, it   s very simple. You keep the    ms    together.  If you can substitute    he,    you use    who.    If you can substitute    him,     you use    whom.    Keep the    ms    together. And it was full of all kinds of  little things like that that you just don   t see any more. So, I used her  teaching book.  When World War II broke out, my parents were in Oklahoma City and  Faye and Grandmother and Grandfather were in Enid. It was an eighty-mile  train trip. They sent me on the train by myself as a little, tiny two-year-  old   not quite two. I had my own little suitcase, little tiny suitcase,  had my own chair, and I had my lunch. They gave me to the conductor,  who was somebody we knew, somebody we knew very well or I  wouldn   t have been sent. It took an hour and a half, I think, to get to  Enid. These were troop trains going to Vance Air Force Base, and I can  remember all these men on this train and I was supposed to sit in my  little chair. (Laughs) Do you think I sat in my little chair? I had the best  time. I skipped up and down those isles. I talked to all of them. I just had  the most wonderful time. I just thought that was so great to get to go to  Enid and visit Grandmother and Faye. Can you imagine nowadays  putting a child  on a train along ? But they weren   t the least bit afraid to  do it and I had a good time. This conductor was somebody we knew and  trusted, probably a relative. But I can   t remember who he was. But I had  a great time.  My grandfather eventually died of stomach cancer in Enid in 1945.  Grandmother died in 1956. Faye married, married Roy Spowart, S-P-O-W-  A-R-T. They moved to Oklahoma City two blocks away from where  we lived. We were on 25th Street, 2124 Northwest 25th, just sold the  house in 1998 I think, and they lived two blocks away, 2105 Northwest  27th. They paid five-hundred dollars too much for the house because  Daddy and Roy knew they would save the money in gas, oil, and tires  going back and forth, because we would make four or five trips a day  between the two houses. Grandmother died in 1956 and it was very sad  because she was my incredibly brave, incredibly beautiful, well-educated  grandmother. She just sort of slowly, slowly left. She slowly  slid into one of the dementias and died. It was horrible to watch her slide  into this.  She had truly been very, very brave. When she and my grandfather lived  out on the country alone, just right before they left, there was a poker  game in the neighborhood. Five men decided that one man had been  cheating and they were quite liquored up and going to hang him. He  made his way to my grandparents    home, very bloodied and beaten up  and in pretty bad shape. Grandmother and Grandfather took him in and  the other five men came to get him. Grandfather was almost blind by  34  then with macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. He could see  light and dark and he sat back a ways with a shotgun across his lap, and  she went to the door and talked to them. She said,    Absolutely not.    She  said,    I know you. I know your parents. You went to school to me. You  will not have him.    And she stood there and backed them down, drunk  and angry and liquored up and all the things that men get, she backed  them down.  In the early days, the trains running through here were not always honest  with their weights or how they would add up the shipping charges. So,  she would go on the day that the local people were going to sell their  wheat and she would stand there and add it in her head. She had this  incredible mind   she really was very smart   this incredible mind for  math. I can   t even spell math, but she had an incredible mind for it and  she stood there and watched. And a lot of people didn   t speak English  very well. So, as she slid into melancholy and dementia, the community  really protected her and took care of her. But it was terrible to see her  slide into that and nothing could be done. She just sort of wasted away.  So, she just slipped away, faded away in this cloud of dementia and it  was not good.  Oklahoma was   there was a saying,    Oklahoma was fine for men and  mules. It was hell on women and horses.    When Mother and Faye  started to school at Fairview School, when Mother was eight years old     so that   d be six, eight, 1914   they had to have their tonsils out. So, Doc  Wolfe would set up his office here, all the kids would come to town,  drive to town. That was at least a two hour, three hour drive. They would  put them in the chair, they   d slide a wire around the top of the tonsil and  go,    click.    Then they   d slide one around the bottom of the tonsil and  go,    click,    do it on the other side, cauterize it, and the kids would get  out of the chair and go home. I know  (Laughs) And I said,    Well,  Mother, didn   t you have a sore throat?    She said,    Well, yes. I guess we  did for a while.    But every fall he would do that and I guess that was  fairly common. I asked her if she ever remembered anybody bleeding to  death or getting an infection,    No.    I wonder how much safer we are in  our hospitals.  I have a concern about our farm and it is a real concern. As I look into  the future, I   m very concerned about what we   re doing to our land. We  have a creek. Now, this is an Oklahoma, red mud creek. This is not a  New England babbling brook. But when I was a kid you could get trout  and catfish out of there. I haven   t seen a fish in decades, not in decades.  And you could drink out of it. It made Momma crazy, but you could  drink out of it. I wouldn   t drink out of it now. It smells funny. There   s  something wrong. If you stand down there and look and realize the  amount of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers that are being used in  35  Finchum  K. Lewis  Finchum  those fields around it and the number of cattle being grazed on the  pasture. That   s all draining into my creek, which then drains into  Kingfisher Creek, which drains into the Cimarron, which drains into the   Canadian . With towns taking water out of that along the way and  farmers irrigating with it, that concerns me a great deal. That really is  frightening and I don   t know what to do about it. It   s every creek and  every river in this country, so I don   t know what to do about that.  The newer wheats are a lot less  hardy , are a lot more fragile than the  old wheats. They go down, they go down. That   s it. They don   t come  back up. If they shatter, it   s all over with. They require a lot more  herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers. Now, they yield a lot more, but  what are we paying for in the yield? Are we really making more at the  end of the day than what they made with the old, Early Triumph that  didn   t require the herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers? You didn   t make  as much. You had much simpler equipment that could go through and  get it. You had a longer window to get it, didn   t turn over and shatter as  much. Are we making wise choices here for our health and for other  peoples    health? So, that   s a real concern to me.  The farm I have is the northwest quarter of section thirty-four, Altona  Township. And I did find it. I have written it there. You had asked me  about what we did with the farm. When Leonard Jarvel moved off, we  took over farming it for ourselves. And the Rother family, Vince Rother  and his sons usually farmed for us, but they contract farmed. They  would put it in and we   d pay them. They   d harvest it and we   d pay them.  Vince Rother and Ed Rother, who still live here, still help me out as best  they can.  Putting in wheat?  Yes, we put all in wheat now. Well, the government tells you what you  can put in. But it is in wheat and in pasture. So, you put what the  government lets you put in. Several years ago Chesapeake Oil Company  fracked a well wrong out here and there was gas all over the place and  everybody was terrified that that gas would get on fire and explode and  they   d have a fire underground. We   re the farm it went up on. And the  Coffees across the road saw it and warned everybody. It was really  scary. It   s interesting that the young lady who showed us in here is a  Coffee. Of course, she doesn   t know me, but I know her. I know who  she is. Mother lived to be one hundred. At some point in the last few  years,  Mother  switched over to the Coffee family who are across the  road. So, they still farm for us now. Mother lived to be one hundred.  Would you like a little information about her? (Laughs)  Sure.  36  K. Lewis  Well, she was in the real estate business and she was something else.  She was red-headed and she worked. She always worked. By eight  o   clock in the morning, she had that girdle on, she was sitting at the  kitchen counter, and she was ready to get to work. She   d been in the real  estate business since 1948. A friend called and said,    Would you please  help me? Would you be the broker in my insurance office? You don   t  have to do anything.    Well, within six weeks she had that office shaped  up. She worked there for about twenty years and she was head of the  county mental health   the county mental health, whatever the   the  civilian group that supports the county mental health. She was head of  the Women   s Association at the First Presbyterian Church. She was  president of her church circle. She took plants to the old folks in the old  folks    home, you know, the seventy-year-olds, and here she is in her  nineties.  At age ninety-two we made her retire because she couldn   t see anymore.  She couldn   t write her contracts and she couldn   t drive, and that was the  worst mistake. It was just the worst mistake. But she was still farming,  she was still doing all this. She got other people to drive her. She was  still playing the oil business and she was still pretty good at the oil  business. She played the stock market. She was good at the stock  market. She lived to be one hundred and just sort of faded away at the  end. Her mind was quite good until the end, and she just slept a little  more and more and more. She would not go to the doctor. She would not  go to the doctor. She was always forty pounds overweight. She ate the  worst possible southern diet. Everything was fried, even the salad  dressing was made with bacon grease. She cooked with   what cooking  she did, she hated to cook   with the bacon grease can. I started my  married life with a bacon grease can on the stove. But her food was just  terrible. Her idea of exercise was walking out to the mailbox, if she had  to, and she lived to be one hundred. She got hit by lightning in 1944  when my sister was a baby, and she got mugged in the late    80s down at  the First Presbyterian Church. The women in the hospital called me and  said,    You   re going to have to come and get her. We can   t keep her  anymore. She   s driving us crazy     I brought her home and let me tell  you, I can see why she drove them crazy. She had all this energy and she  worked right until the end, doing everything she wanted to.  I was kind of waiting for my husband to get back because after she died  and we were transferring things over   my husband   s an accountant, so  he handles most of our business and things like that. He said,    Give me  the farm contracts.    And I said,    What farm contracts?    He said,    The  farm contract you have with the Coffees, the management contract.  What do they pay you?       We don   t have any contracts.    My husband,  the Yankee, almost hit the ceiling.    How do you do business without  37  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  having contract?       On a handshake, Bill. I know where they live. We   ve  known them for generations. This boy   s great-grandmother saved my  mother   s life a number of times. My grandfather gave them free water. I  don   t need a contract, Bill. We just shake hands.    (Laughs) We have  teased my poor husband about being the Yankee all these years. We   ve  been married forty-eight years, and he really does have wonderful  Confederate ancestors. My daddy was so upset when I was going to  marry a New Yorker. He was really upset about that, but about twenty  years after we got married, I guess, cousin Mary Catherine Curtis Lewis  sent us letters from Bill   s great-great-grandfather and they had been  camped at     Pea Ridge.  Pea Ridge  And they were camped with all these Indians and the  Cherokees. The Pin Cherokees were naked and painted and were going  to take scalps, but the Choctaws and Chickasaws were there also and  they didn   t. I took that to my daddy and said,    Look here.    I can   t tell  you how much better my daddy thought of him, how much more he  thought of him. He really did.  Some of his people were Choctaws.  But  it   s just a difference in culture. He really is a New Yorker. (Laughs)  After Mother died, we had to buy a truck. We had to have a truck to haul  the Rambler and then to get out here and get around. My husband did  not want me to buy a pickup truck. Not on your tin type. That wasn   t in  his plan. Well, you know about love and first sight? My husband and  this pickup were just like this. (Gestures) He   s become an Oklahoma  pickup driver. All you need is a what?  Gun rack.  That   s right. Of all the things I think his mother never would have  forgiven me for, I think this is the worst. He and this pickup just love  each other. He goes over to Alameda every week as a docent on the USS  Hornet, which is one of the last of the World War II aircraft carriers. He  has to go through a very bad area of Oakland and this big, black truck  says,    don   t fool with me, guys.    But I think my mother would even just  die that I bought a pickup for my husband, that my pickup has become  his  (Laughs)  Okay, you had asked about the oil. Yes, we have oil. My husband was  an accountant and we spent two years in Brazil and I taught school there.  All of us would go down and see Senor Nelson, the local Macumba  fortuneteller, and he was wonderful. He would throw these shells and he  kept telling me I was psychic. I knew that. All the Nunemakers are  psychic. We know that. And that I could really do better with my being  psychic. He spoke Portuguese, I spoke English so I had to take a  38  Finchum  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  Finchum  K. Lewis  B. Lewis  translator. And you didn   t ask him questions. You wrote out your  questions and put them in the purse. So, he was throwing shells and he  says,    Oh,    and he was smoking this cigar and blowing it in my face and  there are chickens running around. This was an interesting thing. He was  doing this and he says,    Oh, I see. Your mother wants to know about the  oil. Well, tell her it will be along the seam where the red and the black  soil goes together.    Guess what. That   s exactly where it was and it was  within that time frame. He was very, very good because we do have red  soil and black soil. It   s just like,    Okay, there they are.    So, we do have  oil and that   s wonderful. And that has, I think, mollified my Yankee  husband about me keeping these farms. (Laughs)  About when did you discover that, though, what time period were they  built, the wells?  We were in L.A., so it was around    80, 1980-   81, somewhere in that  time frame.  But within the time frame that Senor Nelson said.  Before or after your father     Before my dad   he died in    86, so it was before he died, yes. And my,  that really has been nice money to have. It really has, because for a  number of years if I   d have sold it, I   d have made a great deal of money  just putting it in the bank and collecting the money. But not after the  way my folks worked so hard to keep that for us. And we have moved     I   ve lost track of the  times  we   ve moved. Fourteen times the first  eighteen years we were married or eighteen times the first fourteen or  something. This is home. This is home. I still know people here. I know  people I   ve known for generations. And this has a stability, and I almost  don   t know how to tell you, farmers hang onto their land. You just hang  onto it no matter what. We don   t have children. My sister doesn   t have  children. So, I really don   t know what I   m going to do. But over my  dead body will that farm or the Rambler go. I can remember my  grandfather telling me,    Hang on to your land.    And it may have been  foolish because Grandfather came out because his sister was across the  road, Aunt Ella McKemy Smith. Her family went on to California and  made a fortune so maybe we   re doing the wrong thing. But it just means  home to me, and it means that I still have a place in a stable community,  I still have people to talk to that I   ve known for generations, I like the  culture here. I just like it very much. And I don   t know how to tell you  why I hang on to it. Why do I hang on to it? My sister   s the same.  Because it   s home.  39  K. Lewis  Finchum  B. Lewis  Finchum  B. Lewis  Finchum  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  Because it   s home. There was a saying on the frontier that your really  good friends were the ones you dug graves with, because nobody would  come out and dig graves and you had to dig graves in the worst   hottest  summer day. We dug graves with all of these people and some of them  are just  wonderful    some of them aren   t, but some are just wonderful.  I like this culture. I live in crazy California where an awful lot of people  are not Americans anymore and don   t want to be Americans. Here,  everybody   s pretty American and pretty nice. There   s something terribly  seductive about having men open doors for you and say,    Thank you  ma   am, yes ma   am, let me get that for you, ma   am.    Oh, yes. I can go  with that. (Laughter) I can handle that, believe me   You   d also asked about the house and the farm buildings. Okay. When  my grandfather built the house out there, some of the Cheyenne had told  him not to build the house there. That was where the big wind came. So,  he did it anyway and I think there was a storm early 1910, whatever it  was, that damaged the house. There was another storm in the early    30s  that damaged the house. And then the spring of    61 there was a terrible  cyclone. It took the house south of us, it took us and all our buildings,  and it took the Aligs. I   ve forgotten which Alig it was. It took an Alig a  mile north, made the news. It took everything, just wiped it clean.  Everything was gone. So, that was the end and that meant that we  weren   t ever going to stay out here much or be out here much. So, we  went back and forth to Oklahoma City, which was thirty, thirty-five  minutes away. After Mother moved out close on the Northwest  Highway, it was even a shorter time. So, it was very sad to see it go, but  it was okay, too. It never had running water and it was deteriorating.  Nobody was living in it. We didn   t even come out and stay in it. We like  air conditioning. We   re spoiled. (Laughs)  Do you envision building on it and retiring to it?  No. (Laughter)  Too far from anything, isn   t it?  Too far, yes it is. Well, and as you get older, you   ve got to worry about  medical.  True.  Now, you   re not that far. But I mean, we   ve talked to about retiring to  someplace else in California. But at some point, you   re going to be back  again because you   ve got to be near a medical facility.  And we   re about twenty, twenty-five minutes from Stanford Hospital,  40  Finchum  K. Lewis  Finchum  K. Lewis  B. Lewis  K. Lewis  Finchum  K. Lewis  B. Lewis  Finchum  which is a very fine hospital. I   ve had two major cancers. I struggle with  Lymphedema and I   m having some heart problems now. So, I could be  in real trouble if I moved out there.  Not to mention the wind.  That   s right, not to mention the wind. Which sometimes feels very good,  it feels very free   for about five minutes. (Laughs)  How often do you come back to Oklahoma?  We make it about twice a year. As long as my folks were here, I made it  more. And especially as we were traveling, I   d have to come home. I   d  just have to come home because we owned the house in Oklahoma City  more than fifty years and I never got my room dismantled. (Laughs) And  when Mother built her new house, we just simply transferred my room  over because I spent so much time at home. And Bill spent a lot of time  at home with me, too. It   s hard to get to New York where his folks were.  And then when we moved to Brazil, we spent eight, nine weeks here?  Yes, something like that. It was from early October to early December.  Waiting for our Visas to come through. So, it   s part of the home thing.  As the Nunemakers had helped my grandfather build this little one-room  place when he married Grandmother, then Grandmother and Grandfather  helped my parents with their first house. Momma and Daddy helped us  with our first house. So, it just kind of  normal . We had a closer family  relationship than a lot of families in California have. There   s this farm  thing or this Oklahoma culture thing about  family  and people are so  nice here. I just called the bank and said,    I would like to do an  interview.    And Dave Krittenbrink said,    Oh, of course.    Well, then  they had     Closed for Veteran   s Day.     Veteran   s Day. So, he said,    Let me call the insurance company next  door.    And I don   t know anybody here and they said,    Why, of course.  We   d be happy for you to.    They don   t know me, nothing. I wouldn   t be  treated like this in California. They   d have a guard at the door and I   d  show my I.D. and,    Aren   t you through yet? Are you ready yet?    So, I  like the culture back here. Really, really nice. I might move back.  (Laughter)  Moving back is one thing. Moving back to the farm is quite another.  That   s true. That   s true.  41  K. Lewis  Finchum  K. Lewis  And there   s nobody out there now. Even the Coffees are moving to  town. There   s just nobody there. You had asked about how I   d seen  things change. Now, I remember it was very dry here with no trees.  There just weren   t trees. I can   t believe all these trees that have grown  up. Where did they come from? I think even into my parents    time, trees  didn   t grow out here or the Depression had gotten them or the bad  droughts we had in the    50s, which kind of scared me a little bit because  we got caught in a couple of dust storms out here. My parents told us  how much worse it was in the    30s. So, I hear people talk about how bad  things are now and I think,    No, they   re bad, but they   re not what they  were, what these people survived.     That may be a good place to end. Thank you so much for your time and  sharing.  Well, thank you, too. Thank you very much.  -------  -------
