 Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Nykolaiszyn  B. Ford  Nykolaiszyn  B. Ford  J. Ford  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  B. Ford  Today is September 5, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today  we   re in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to speak with Bill and Joe Ford, and this  part of our Centennial Farm Family Project. Thank you for having us  today.  You   re more than welcome. We   re glad to have you here. You   ve got a  good football team this year, by the way.  We hope.  We watched them play Florida State, and that was pretty exciting. Are  you a big Cowboy fan?  I   m from Florida. (Laughter)  Oh, my goodness.  I went to Florida State.  Okay.  We have a lot to talk about.  Go Pokes   So let   s begin with having you tell us a little bit about the farm that  we   re talking about today. What   s it called?  Well, it   s the Joseph A. Ford Farm. That   s how we   ve always called it:  the Ford Farm. I can tell you a little bit about the family, how they came  to Oklahoma. That   s, I guess, what you want to hear.  5  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  That   s a good place to start.  Okay. In 1895, there were, gee, let   s see. There were five runs in  Oklahoma, settlements where they opened the land for settlement, and  the pioneers came from different states and helped settle Oklahoma.  Well, there  were  five of them, and the last one was the Kickapoo Land  Run, and it was over here between Shawnee and Oklahoma City around  north of McLoud. That was the last run that they had that they   d opened  for settlement. My great-grandparents were from Grand Rapids,  Michigan, and in 1895 they came down when they opened the settlement  up. They drew an allotment in those days. A lot of the TV depicts  everybody lining up, and they shoot the gun, and they go running across  the prairie and fall down and all that. Well, this is where they had an  allotment drawing, and so they came down from Michigan in what was  called an immigrant car. Have you ever heard that phrase?  No.  An immigrant car was like a boxcar with slats in it so you could breathe  inside, air and all that. Well, it took five days to pull it from Michigan to  McLoud, Oklahoma, where they got off the train.  In  the car you would  put livestock on one end, your household goods on the other, and you  rode in the middle, five days. That   s how they came down, and it was  quite an endeavor. My great-grandmother   s family, there was some  memos there that said that her name was Emma Ford and said that  Emma went to the frontier, and that was the end of it. There was no  more communications that we could ever find. You can imagine it   d be  like today going to central Australia or someplace, and you just left your  family. By doing that, you just, oh my, you   re on your own. It   s not a     Where   s Mom? Where   s Dad?    and all that.  They came down and got off the train at McLoud, Oklahoma, and their  allotment was northeast of there where the farm is today. When they  went over there, they had no idea where they were going or what was  there. It was just, that was your luck of the draw. When they got over  there, there was a lot of woods and some farmland and some places to  have some water. Of course, you had to have water. The other people of  McLoud said,    My goodness, that   s not a very good place for your  allotment. Why don   t you come back to McLoud, and we   ll help you  settle over here?    Well, Great-Granddad, he was a very outgoing person,  and he said,    No, I   ve already made friends with the Kickapoo Indians.  I   m staying put,    and so the Kickapoo Indians were very much part of  our family   s settlement in this part of the country because they  immediately made friends with each other.  6  Finchum  B. Ford  Great-Granddad, he was a good farmer. He planted pear trees and pecan  trees. You didn   t have fruit in those days, and you needed fruit. Of  course, didn   t have refrigeration, no electricity, but a pear you could  wrap up in newspaper and put in a dark place. It would slowly mature  and ripen, and you   d have fruit during the winter months which you  needed for your health. They dug a hand-dug well there, and they built  this log cabin, as you see in this picture. That   s where we now have the  centennial farm plaque in front of that cabin. It   s one of the few original  cabins that   s on the original site that I know of in Oklahoma.  A lot of them have gone to rack and ruin and all of that, and they just  have been destroyed. Other families have bought out the farms and had  no interest, but this is one of the very few places. We rehabbed that,  probably twenty years ago, and fixed the cabin up. It had some  attachments to it through the years that some people had put on it, a  chicken house and a place to cook. We took it back to the original  configuration and fixed it up. On your way home, if you wanted to go by  there, there   s the map on that postcard that tells you when you go up   Highway  177 to Stillwater, four and a half miles north of I-40 is the  Hazel Dell Road. You turn there, and you go two miles west and a mile  north, and you see the cabin.  I   ve called. There   s a person that lives right there next to it. My  granddad built that house for his parents later on, got them out of the log  cabin and built them a nice two-story farmhouse. Well, Les Godwin  lives there now, a good friend of ours. I   ve called, and he   s expecting  you to swing by there on the way. He   s got it all looking real nice and  can show you a little bit, and you can take some pictures right there.  Sounds good.  So that   ll be interesting. Anyway, they came down and got off and made  friends with the Indians. Great-Granddad was very good about sharing,  and he shared his produce. He raised turkey, and he raised chickens, so  you had eggs, you had meat, you had fruit, and also you learned to grow  corn. Corn was very important in this part of the country. We have an  old corn-sheller out here that was on the farm. You would shell the corn,  and you could grind the corn, or you could feed it to your chickens or  hogs or your turkeys. Didn   t have a lot of beef cattle in those days. It  was mainly hogs and poultry because you could handle that in a small  area. Didn   t have the big pastures, like, for a cow. Most of them had,  also, a dairy cow, though. Anyway, that   s how they started. The log  cabin right there, again, it   s very unusual that you find one in that shape  on the original site. Go in there, and you   ll see big turnbuckles and  cables that we pulled it all together and kept it in good shape.  7  Upstairs, it   s a Northern-influenced cabin because they came from  Michigan. That meant they wanted to conserve the heat, so they built a  two-story. You had a little cooking area, and your living room was  downstairs. There   s a small staircase you went up, and that is where you  had a rope across, for a divider. Kids were on one side, Mom and Dad  on the other side. Everybody had their own little trunk, and if it didn   t fit  in the trunk, you didn   t need it. Everything had to fit in the trunk at your  bed, and that   s all you had.  They had a hand-dug well outside for water, and you can see the well   s  right over on the northwest corner of the cabin there. You   ll see that.  Anyway, that   s how they got started, and it was not a pretty sight, you  can just imagine. The glamour and all of that that you see on the movies  was not there. It was very, very hard work, the weather, just everything,  trying to survive. You had to kind of prove up on the 160 acres, their  allotment. President Roosevelt, after a while, gave them a patent which  we have today, the patent to the property.  My granddad, J. Lloyd Ford, who started Shawnee Milling Company,  (here   s his picture) he could see that they were having a difficult time, so  he said,    I   ve got to go get a job to get some money to help us, food and  everything else.    So he went to work in Oklahoma City, selling  women   s dresses, and because he came from Michigan, he had no  prejudice. The minority people in Oklahoma City, he treated them all the  same. Because of that, the word got around, and he became really a very  popular guy. He sold women   s dresses to everybody, all the different  tribal people and African Americans and whatever. Because of that he  became very popular.  Well, then a guy that had the flour mill in downtown Oklahoma City,  Acme Flour Mill, heard about him and said,    I need a person to help me  sell flour in southeast Oklahoma.    Now, you   ve got to remember there  was only buggies and a little bit of rail. No automobiles could get  around. This was 19-, probably   03 or   04. That was his territory, and he  became very successful because he could play baseball and had a good  tenor voice. He would go down to these little towns and play baseball,  pitch for them on Saturdays, sing in the Baptist choir on Sundays. Then  they   d go,    Mr. Ford, why don   t you come back next week or two weeks  or something, and here   s a bunch of orders to get you to come back.     They all gave him flour orders, and feed and cornmeal. He went back to  Oklahoma City and turned in his orders, and,    Goodness,    they said,     where   d you get all these?    He just became very popular.  In    06, some people down around Ardmore, one of his customers, the  Westheimer family, Simon Westheimer, they became very good friends.  He heard about this little barn (there   s a picture of the barn right there)  8  J. Ford  B. Ford  J. Ford  B. Ford  J. Ford  that was for sale, so he came up. He   d married my grandmother, and  they pooled their money, savings, and everything, and bought the little  barn in    06. That   s how Shawnee Milling Company got started. The  farm that you   re interested in here, you can see how the relationship  between our family and the Kickapoo Indians was so important in the  early days.  Now, as we put this book together   you write a book, and there   s a  beginning, and then you get into all the meat of the book. You try to  wind it up, and you say,    Okay, what   s going to wind this thing up?  There   s got to be something that I   ve missed.    We said,    Let   s focus on  the friendship between the early settlers in this area and the Native  Americans, the Kickapoo Indians.    Joe helped me. We had a picnic and  brought   as best we could, we went to the Kickapoo Tribe  Headquarters, and we found out the allotment of Granddad   s in  relationship to the other tribal people that were in this area, their names.  So we put out kind of an invitation to all of those that were connected  somehow back in 1895. We were going to have a picnic, and we did.  Here is the   Joe, you might tell them a little bit what we did here.  As you can see in the picture, behind there is a teepee that Dad and I cut  down with the help of the Kickapoos. We cut down the poles for it in  southeast Oklahoma. They took us out when I was probably about  eleven or twelve, and we cut those teepee poles. They helped us build  that teepee, and then that, of course, is the original log cabin next to it.  We brought together their families, their tribal leadership, and our  family, as well. Dad   s brother and sisters from across the state came, and  we basically had a picnic and talked about the ongoing friendship.  There   s several products that we make at the mill, corn products, that are  very important to their history and very important to some of their  traditional feasts that they have throughout the year that we still donate  to the Kickapoo Indians. They still come to the mill at times, and we  provide them, we share with them some of those products just as Great-  Granddad did so many years ago. It was a wonderful picnic just to  remember that history and that friendship, and Dad memorialized it with  an agreement     You   ll enjoy this.     that we all signed that day.  I   d like for you to read   well, first, let   s see this.  Why don   t you read it for them?  9  B. Ford  J. Ford  B. Ford  First, let me read this for you.  Why don   t you read that for them, what we signed that day and what  the     You think about in history when the Americans moved west to settle the  West, one of the most important things they did was try to   I know  there was a lot of controversies and there was some hostilities on both  sides and all this, but by and large people tried to get along. They tried to  understand each other, so, in that, I know through the years they worked  on what I would call treaties of understanding, a    Who am I, and who  are you?    and    We need to get along, and we need to share.    This was  July 8, 2005, so before we had our anniversary in April of    06, we had  this picnic, and this is what it was.  I said,    For over a hundred years, the Joseph Almeron Ford family was  settled on this site near McLoud, Oklahoma, in 1895, and the Kickapoo  tribe of Oklahoma had been friends and shared many memories together.  We, the undersigned, commemorate this day and pledge ourselves to  continued friendship and kindness to one another for the next one  hundred years. It is hoped that at that time, members of the same  families will once again come together to renew their pledge on this day,  eighth of July, 2005.    It   s amazing. Looky here, how many names were  there, and they all signed. It   s kind of like giving your wedding vows  over. (Laughs) You know what I mean? It   s, like, to reestablish who you  are and what you   re doing and why you   re doing this kind of stuff, so  that   s why we did that.  What   s most interesting is the Chief of the Kickapoos got up, and I  didn   t know he was going to do this. It was all happening right here on  this site where we did the thing. He said,    Shawnee News-Star,    the  newspaper here,    will  be commemorating  one hundred years in the  McLoud area for the Ford family.    This is what they read.    As history  becomes eventful, so does a memorabilia collection with the Kickapoo  Tribe of Oklahoma, who have been neighbors and friends to the Ford  family. The playmates for the Ford children were: Murdock, Kirk, Frye,  Logan, Wahpekeche, Wiles, Meskequennock, Kaskuske, Ketcheshawno,  Kisketon, Curley, White, and Bentley-Walker. Many other families are  known, but these families listed were homeowners and/or had tribal  allotments near the Ford home site.     To summarize this long-standing friendship and respect to each other,  the Fords were treated with respect because they shared their gardens.  Other non-Indians asked them to move closer to them. However, the  area tribal members told them that they would be all right and to stay  put. Today the Fords still share their food with area tribal members.  1 0  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford     This is why the Fords are having a    Welcome Luncheon,    to tell the  Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma,    Thank you for the one hundred years of  neighborly love and respect that we so cherished with our ancestors and  for one hundred years of memories and kindness.        Now, isn   t that something? That   s what we did to commemorate. So it   s  not just people that came in this area and built a home site, but it   s how  they related once they got here. Oklahomans have always been noted for  their friendly attitude and their friendship, and you see how many times  Oklahomans are put in high places by our government in Washington  because you can get along. Oklahomans don   t have a lot of baggage that  they carry with them. I think that   s so important to think about, is our  state. We were all immigrants in this state, and once we got here it   s,     How did you get along with one another? How did you relate to the  Native Americans that were here?    I think that was most important. I  wanted to bring that up in part of the history. I think it   s different   you  find similar stories, but we   re very proud of that particular part of it.  Well, you mentioned one son from the early days. Did he have other  children?  Well, yes, my great-grandfather had two sons and a daughter. My uncle  Lewis Ford was the younger brother of my grandfather, and he worked  here at the mill, in charge of a lot of the production. Then they had a  sister named Fern. I called her Aunt Fern. She lived around this area for  a long time and then passed away, but there were the three of them.  There is a picture, Joe, somewhere. Maybe it   s downstairs in the  historical room. We can go down there. We built a room, not built, but  we put a lot of memorabilia downstairs. That   s their children, and then  my granddad had two boys and two girls. The oldest girl was Betty and  then   no. The oldest son was J. Lloyd Ford, Jr., and then sister Betty,  and then my dad was the third child, and then he had a younger sister,  Katherine. They had four children. Then me, I have two sisters and a  brother, so there are four of us. I   m the third generation here at the mill,  and Joe is the fourth generation.  And so how many children do you have?  Well, I have two girls and a boy, and Joe   s got two girls and a boy.  Okay, so four to three to three.  Anyway, that   s kind of the history of it. What you don   t know and what  you can   t really get the flavor of unless you were actually sitting here  talking with them is how hard it was. We go through 110-degree  1 1  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  weather, and we complain and all that, but we duck inside to the air  conditioning. Or we turn on the tap, and we got clean water that comes  out.    Boy, this is pretty neat. Clean, cool water.    Or we go to turn on the  stove, and you got natural gas. You just cook your bacon and eggs. It  wasn   t that way. They struggled every day to eat and clean and do all  those things.  That   s the part of the history that a lot of us don   t really, I don   t think,  appreciate that much. Still don   t. It   s so foreign to us to think about the  things that we take for granted. Get in your car and go to a hospital.  There   s a school. You can go by a pump and get some good gasoline and  run a car. Didn   t even have cars, did they, you know? I think it   s  important that we and you all maintain the continuity of the history for  all of us because it   s so easy in today   s world to forget that and forget  the sacrifices that people made.  Well, did he have a job off the farm, your great-grandfather?  No. I think he just kind of got tired, and my granddad built the mill and  then was able to take care of them. Then they moved to Shawnee when  he started the mill, and he fixed a little place for them there, east of their  house.  Well, after the pears and the turkeys, did they raise other crops or     Corn. Corn was the main thing because you could use it to feed your  livestock and chickens and grind it for your cornmeal. What was the  story I was going to tell you?  Well, did you spend much time out there in your youth?  Yes, Dad would take my brother and I out there a lot, and we would  always go out, clean up brush, and trim. You didn   t have a lot of  equipment. Like, we didn   t have tractors or brush hogs and all that kind  of stuff. Bob and I, my brother Bob   there was an encampment of  Kickapoos right south of the farm, about a mile south. In the  summertime, the wind was out of the south, and in the evenings you  could hear them. A lot of times, they   d have little get-togethers and have  their drums, so you could hear the drums beat.  My brother Bob and I, we was just kids, and back there we did a lot of  things you wouldn   t think about today. We just took off,    Dad, we   ll be  back     About eight, nine, ten years old, we   d walk down there. They   d  see us coming, and they   d take us over. They couldn   t speak English; a  lot of them were still speaking Kickapoo. They would give us some  water out of the spring, and then we   d sit there and visit a minute and  1 2  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  then walk back. That was a big adventure for us. They were always so  kind to us, the Indians were, Kickapoos.  When did the farm get electricity?  Boy, that   s a good question. REA  Rural Electric Administration  came  through in, probably, I   m going to guess during the Depression. I   m not  sure when that was, but I   d guess that   s when Rural Electric came into  being. I   m not sure about the dates, but that was a big, big moment to get  electricity.  And did they do any other conservation efforts on the farm, building  ponds or     Well, I think a lot of things they didn   t know, but when they did try to  plow and had a little bit of wash, that   s when the government had  programs to educate you on the proper way to plow in terraces and  contour lines so you didn   t plow up and down the hills and cause a wash.  Oklahoma, our soil is such that it washes pretty easy if you have bad  practices, bad farming practices.  And was McLoud the closest town where they would take their products?  Yes, it was. I was going to tell you that. Glad you mentioned that. When  they came down  from Michigan , they brought barley with them from  up north, and some oats, and he used that to barter for food in McLoud.  He   d go over there with a sack of it, and they would get food and  whatever they needed, but it said in the book there, they were only able  to get what they needed after the guy could sell the barley and the oats.  He had to find a buyer for them, and then he was able to pay them. Then  they used the money for food and different supplies.  Well, what had he done in Michigan?  He did a lot of things. Famer, one. He was salesperson. Remember about  1890s, there was a Depression in our history of the United States, and  the Upper Midwest was having some problems. That was one of the  things that kind of pointed them to go look for a better deal. He did a lot  of odd jobs.  And he was already married when he came and already had children.  Do you know much about where they went to school when they got here?  No, I think they   let me think. If you went through, what, the sixth  grade, you were pretty well educated back in those days. I think they  were all over the sixth-grade level when they came here.  1 3  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Nykolaiszyn  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  And church was an important part of     Yes, my great-grandmother was a Northern Baptist, and when they came  down, Granddad helped build the little Hazel Dell Baptist Church right  there on the corner. When you came down, when you turn on that map  there, there   s that little corner right here. Right there is the Hazel Dell  Baptist Church. You turn and go. There   s no intersection here, so you go  two miles and a mile. He helped start that little church up there,  Granddad did. Great-Grandmother was a very strong Northern Baptist.  And then your grandfather grew up on the farm, as well?  No. So far as growing up, they just did chores, and then he went to  Oklahoma City and got him a job. (Laughs)  Okay, that   s right.  See, he was close to eighteen, nineteen years old when they came down.  Now there   s a Kickapoo Indian school that   s over on this mile section  here. The farm is on the northeast corner of the section. If you go to the  southwest corner, there   s an old Kickapoo Indian school there that   s  been mainly torn down.  What are the other structures on the farm outside of the cabin?  Well, there was a barn, of course, years ago, and it   s gone to pot. Then  Granddad built this nice two-story frame house for his parents. It was  hard to get any kind of materials, so they built a little shed on the side of  the log cabin for chickens and stuff like that. Then they built a kitchen.  They just tried to move the heat out. All of a sudden it   s not good  because it   s so hot here. People that came from Georgia over to  Oklahoma, they built what was called a dogtrot house. Have you ever  heard that word? Well, a dogtrot house is you lived here, and you had  your kitchen and your little area there that you cooked with, and you  joined it together with a little covered porch. That was called the dogtrot.  The people from Georgia, they didn   t want the heat. The people that  came from Michigan, they tried to   and you   ll see ours is a two-story  log cabin.  It   s been important to the family to keep the piece of land this entire  time?  Yes, it   s never been outside of the family since 1895. I   ve made it my     I   m a guy that likes projects, and this is one of my projects. Now our  company, Shawnee Milling Company, which Granddad started and all  1 4  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  that, has now bought the farm. The farm now resides in the company,  and our family is the stockholders, the owners of the company. In effect,  it   s still in the family.  And what   s going on on the property today?  Well, I   ve got a man that leases it. He had a bulldozer, and so he has  cleaned up a lot of stuff for us. We   re going to burn a bunch of brush  piles, but he   s opened up the grass back again. It was just overrun by  blackjack timber and blackberry bushes and stuff like that, so we   re  making some big headway getting it back restored to grasslands the way  it was.  And your grandparents and great-grandparents had a garden?  Oh, yes, that was a very important part.  Did a lot of canning?  That   s a good question. I   m sure they did later on. Right at the beginning  it was just a matter of survival, but I think as soon as they could, they  started the canning process.  Had chickens, you said?  Oh, yes, chickens and turkeys and fruit. There was some old pecan trees  there that he raised. The  turkeys  and the chickens provided the meat.  Well, as a youngster, would you go back for holidays like Christmas and  Thanksgiving?  Oh, when I came along, (I was born in    42) we   d always go out to the  farm usually on Saturdays to help and clean things up. There   s just a lot  of things that needed to be done all the time. My great-grandparents  were gone in the early   50s by then, (they   d moved to Shawnee) so  they   d leased the little log cabin to another person. We had to go out and  do a lot of repairs, cleaning.  Then I   m assuming you don   t have a first tractor story for us?  No, the tractors were pretty crude, and they   d use them to plow and turn  the soil and then plant corn. I can remember that. There wasn   t really so-called  brush hogs and front-end loaders and all that kind of stuff. That   s  about all we did with a tractor was turn the plow where you could take  and plant corn, ear it down and raise corn.  1 5  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  And you were born in    42, so at the beginning or during the war, World  War II.  Yes, right at the beginning.  And where did you go to school?  Right here in Shawnee. Joe went to school here in Shawnee and the  University of Oklahoma. Joe went to the University of Oklahoma. My  dad went to the University of Oklahoma, so there   s three generations  there.  So education was important?  Oh, my, that   s huge. Grandparents were always   because they didn   t  have those opportunities. It   s not that they weren   t smart enough. They  just didn   t have   when you   re working and working and working and  working  from     Can to can   t,    is what they always used to say.    If you  can see, and when you can   t see, you quit.    (Laughter) Had you heard  that before?  No.     How long did you work?       Can to can   t.    (Laughter) The other thing  is, I don   t remember people having injuries, back injuries and stuff like  that. You grew up working, and you were used to it. Now these big ol     boys today that are always having back injuries, but when you grew up  on a farm, working lifting, lifting, lifting, lifting, moving.  Was there a time that they thought they might lose the farm?  No. I know they had to borrow money and then pay it back, but I don   t  remember that. They were always very careful. You didn   t ever want to  get overextended.  And why McLoud, though? I know it was part of the land allotment, but  why did they pick McLoud? Do you know?  Well, that   s where you came, on the Kickapoo land run.  That   s where it started?  That   s where it started because the tribal headquarters was right north of  McLoud, and the railroad came to McLoud.  And they had their allotment, their land, before they came? They already  1 6  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ford  knew what they were getting?  No, they got it when they came.  And has that town changed much?  Oh, sure. McLoud, it was just a whistle-stop back there, and of course  now with Oklahoma City coming this way, it   s growing.  I   ve not been there, so we   ll have to check it out on our way back, too.  I hope you   ll go by the site and take pictures.  We sure will.  And then in the book here, you   ll enjoy seeing a lot of the history of  some of these early pictures.  With the various children through the years, there wasn   t an issue of  who got the farm?  No, my dad was pretty smart about that. He worked, and he worked out  where he would purchase the  land . He purchased it from the other  members because they had no interest. They lived in Oklahoma City,  and Dad had the interest to keep it going. He purchased it from his  parents and then put it in his trust. Then we   ve taken it and put it in the  company   s ownership, so it   s not out being disbursed.  So the next one hundred years is in pretty good shape, then.  Yes, sure. Anyway, I hope that kind of gives you a flavor of everything.  It does. Do you have anything     Joe, do you have any special memories of the farm?  Growing up, we spent a lot of time up there. There   s a nice place to fish  on the property, and we   d go up there and pick blackberries. There   s a  good blackberry patch kind of right behind the cabin. A lot of memories  doing things like that with my sisters and, of course, my mom and dad.  It   s a pretty area. It   s a little bit outside of Shawnee, and so that was a  nice way to get out of town a little bit and go out there and spend some  time. Just how proud you were that we still had this property in the  family after all these years and how hard it must have been for them to  leave what they probably considered civilization and move to this area,  just is very humbling.  1 7  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  We   re very proud to have it, and also to think about what Pepa, (that   s  what I call my great-grandfather or Dad   s granddad, we call him Pepa)  what he did to start from that beginning and to build the foundation for  Shawnee Milling Company and all the employees and the families that  depend on it today is something we   re very proud of. The pioneering  spirit of building the log cabin and coming down here just continued into  the entrepreneurship of starting the company, and it seemed to grow.  Dad, you might say a couple of words about Pepa   s involvement in OBU   Oklahoma Baptist University  and the Gideons.  Have you ever heard of the Gideons?  Just a little.  They put the little Bibles in hospitals and schools. He was the first  Gideon in Oklahoma because it started just a few years earlier in  Michigan, the Gideon organization. He brought that with him when he  came down. He was very interested in that. Then the other thing was  Oklahoma Baptist University was getting ready to look for a place to  start the college, and Granddad helped build First Baptist Church here.  He and some other people got together in Shawnee and donated the land  out north of town here for the college to get started. He was a trustee for,  I don   t know, twenty-some, thirty years. It   s a beautiful college today,   Oklahoma Baptist  University.  Sounds like they were very civic-minded from the beginning.  Very, very much, yes.  Involved with Shawnee as well?  Always. He was quite a guy. I think you   ll find these stories, probably,  similar to other pioneers that had that    can do    attitude. Work together,  be friends, a strong foundation of where they came from and what they  brought with them, a desire to have culture and have civilization. It   s not  a rootin   , tootin   , shoot   em up. It was    Let   s have churches and schools  and build things and help each other.    I think that   s what you find more  than anything else.  Well, you described for us this cabin. Can you talk a little bit more about  the house that was built across the street?  Well, you   ll see it, two-story frame house. It   s very plain, but it   s  beautiful, I think. It   s two-story, and we   ve put some siding on it and a  new roof, things like that.  1 8  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  And you spent time in it, growing up, though?  Yes, sure.  Can you describe the layout? Is it similar to     Well, you go in the front door, and stairs go upstairs. Then you got a  little living room on the north side, and, I think, a little bedroom on the  south and a bedroom upstairs, two, and then a kitchen in the back.  Bathroom: indoor, outdoor?  Yes, it was outdoor for a long time, and now they   ve got indoor.  Was it a two-seater or a one-seater, the outside?  Oh, I   ve no idea.  You don   t?  I think what I remember was a one. (Laughter)  A one.  Yes.  Good memories.  Oh, yes.  Was there a favorite dish you liked that your grandmother would fix?  Sure, chicken and dumplings. She could make the dumplings out of the  flour here at the mill that would just knock your eyes out. She could  really cook. And her biscuits, she made big biscuits, not the little biscuits  but big biscuits. That   s what we liked, big biscuits.  And fresh chickens, I   m assuming, from the backyard.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Where Joe lived on Broadway Street there for a while,  the home that my granddad built when he came to Shawnee and started  the mill, beautiful house, 1420 North Broadway, you might want to  write that down, and on your way out, you could go by and see that. It   s  a two-story house that faces east on the west side of Broadway, 1420,  and in the backyard there   s a little concrete slab back there where they  1 9  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  had the chicken house. It was still there, and we   d go there on Sundays  and got fresh chickens and dumplings.  And if you were lucky, blackberry cobbler?  Blackberry cobbler, yes.  Is there anything else you want to add before we sign off?  I just appreciate what you all are doing, and I think it   s important to try  and keep all this alive and well-documented. Maybe these history classes  that come along, it   s not just    Do this and put it on the shelf,    but I hope  that through the educational system of Oklahoma, some of these could  maybe be put into a video or something and show these to kids around  the time where we have statehood day. Kids a lot of times dress up in  bonnets. We have some bonnets back here. I had a lady make them for  me one time. You ever see the bonnets that the little girls wore?  Yes.  Stick way out because they didn   t want the sun, and the long sleeves.  The bonnets were handmade, and you could have kids on statehood day  put on programs and show these, so it comes alive to them.  Well, when they gave you the designation certificate and all that, did you  go to that ceremony?  Yes, oh yes. We went out to Sayre, I think it was. Where was it? I think  it was out to Sayre, Oklahoma, way out there when we had that  presentation on the Centennial Farm Award.  It was important for you to go through that process and get it?  Oh, yes, very appreciative of the state to do that because that does help  to preserve the history. There aren   t many left, I guess, around, places to  see, are there?  When we started our project, there were about nine hundred, and now  there are twelve or fifteen hundred, I think...  Well, good.     but some are falling by the wayside along the way.  Like, here   s the site, and all you see is the site.  2 0  Finchum  J. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Finchum  B. Ford  Yes, some   s in subdivision.  Well, sure.  Not as many, and there   s sure not as many with still cabins.  That   s the original cabin you   ll see. I think when I fixed it up, there was  one or two logs that I had to replace with railroad ties, but the rest of  them you can see the axe marks on the wood when you look at that  cabin.  Well, it speaks to endurance and persistence and dedication, I guess.  Well, and friendship. I hope that   s one of the things that you focus on  are the people and how they really established themselves. You can   t  come in and run roughshod over somebody else. You come in and try to  be friends, neighbors.  Well, we appreciate you being friends today and sharing your story with  us.  Well, thank you.  -------  -------
