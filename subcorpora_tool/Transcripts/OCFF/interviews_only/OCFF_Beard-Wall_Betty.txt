Cindy Wall-Morrison, Betty Beard-Wall, Dean Fuxa  Finchum  Fuxa  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Today is November 23, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project featuring centennial farm families in Oklahoma. Today  we   re in Stillwater at the public library to talk with the owners of the  Thomas Beard Farm, of Logan County. We have with us today Betty  Beard-Wall, Cindy Wall-Morrison and Dean    ?  Fuxa.  Fuxa. Thank you for coming today. Let   s start with Betty. Tell us a little  bit about your childhood, where you were born and then we   ll move into  the farm.  I was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, and my parents quickly moved to  Oklahoma City, bought a house there. They were moving around a little  bit before that. They were teaching in all different small towns in  Oklahoma. They established their home in Wichita Falls. While I was  just a few months old, we bought a house and lived in Oklahoma City  until I was in the second grade and then the war came along, World War  II. My dad, of course, had to go to another town and guess what? It was  Wichita Falls and so, with my mother   s family still there, we moved and  lived there while my dad went to different air force bases.  He was a civilian instructor. A little too old to fight at that time, which  we were thrilled, but he did work in the war effort as an instructor. We  lived there in Wichita Falls all the way through my high school. I went  to Wichita Falls High School. Then like a lot of other Wichita Falls  people, we all go to the University of Oklahoma (OU) from there  because of the oil companies and there are so many fathers that  5  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  graduated from OU. Our coach and a lot of the football players also  went to OU with me and so, we lived in Norman all that time.  Okay, now, let   s back up. You are the granddaughter of   ?  I   m the granddaughter of Thomas B. Beard.  Okay, let   s talk us through the generations then.  Okay. After my grandfather died, he died in January 21 of 1939, we had  the funeral, and he was buried in Marshall  Oklahoma . Dean helped me  locate that when we were here a year ago. I guess it was quite a few  years the two sisters owned it and my dad, which was Albert W. Beard.  Right before he died, he bought the one-third portion that was left to the  two sisters because there were three children only. Thomas and Alice  Beard had three children; one son and two daughters.  He bought the two daughters out. They were living a long way off and  just thought Dad should have it because he loved the farm. He was the  one that kind of kept up with it and always hired people to work it. He   s  the one that knew about the farm. So, he bought them out and he bought  the last one-third one day before he died. It was real unusual. I  sometimes think he was so excited about that, that he just said,    Well,  I   ve accomplished that, I   ve done that. That   s what I wanted to do, is  own that farm all to myself.     So, he bought it from Aunt Bessie?  He bought it from Aunt Bessie and Aunt Molly.  Right, but that last third, was that from   ?  The last third        Bessie?     was from the heirs of Molly.  Oh, okay.  It had really gotten divided because she had three children and he had to  buy out each one of her children instead of her. Aunt Bessie lived in  Texas and she owned the whole thing, so he bought her part and then  Aunt Bessie encouraged the children to go ahead and let Albert, my  father, buy the other one-third so he would have it all. So, he bought the  last little bit. In fact, during trying to settle his estate, it had been mailed,  6  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  but it hadn   t been certified and all that kind of thing, so we had to go  through that in the probate court and make sure that everything was  okay, that they had gotten their payment and all that. So, he did have it  all just right before he died.  I had been told a little bit about the farm. I was only three years old  when my grandfather died, so I knew very little except what I remember  or what Dad had told me in just passing, talking about it over the years.  There are some little things I do remember, even three. I can   t believe  that I can remember some of the little details about it, but I can get into  those in a little while if you   d like to hear about them.  Oh, sure, go ahead.  Do you want to talk about them?  Well, go ahead while you   re thinking about it.  I can remember going to the farm and I was a little city girl of three  years old, so I didn   t know much about farms. I was so intrigued with  the barn, the animals, and one morning they let me go collect eggs from  the chickens, which was quite a treat. I loved doing all that. The only  thing I remember, that was really disturbing to my parents because they  were all farm people and knew how you do it on a farm, when they have  a chicken and they want to eat it, you know what happens. Well, I  didn   t. So, instead of taking care of all that and just letting us take the  chicken home, we took the real chicken home to Oklahoma City, to our  house there.  Well, of course, I had a pet chicken and there was no way we were going  to eat that chicken  (Laughter) So, they had a hard time because here we  were, in this wonderful neighborhood with this cluck, cluck, cluck,  going on all the time. Mother kept saying,    We   re going to have to do  something about that chicken. The neighbors are not going to like this.     But they never let me know   all of a sudden, our chicken disappeared  and got lost. Oh, I cried and cried  But I can definitely remember that  entire story. It was very traumatic to me that I had this pet chicken that  disappeared, but it was from the farm.  One other memory I have is of a rocking chair that was my grandfather   s  and it was in my parent   s house and now, I have it in the guest room in  my house. It   s a very valuable antique. They kept telling me,    Now, be  sure you keep this rocking chair,    because it was made in Oklahoma,  handmade, and it was the coil type. It glides on coils and it rocks. It is  wonderful, the most comfortable rocking chair you   ll ever see. Now, you  see a few of those coil types for babies. They   ll have a glider, kind of, on  7  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  coils. It   s more   it   s smoother. This is all oak wood and it has the back  and it   s on rollers. You can roll it. You can tell it was not professionally  done, but it   s very, very well done and it   s quite a   probably, a valuable  antique. I can remember my grandfather rocking me in that because I  was still two and a half to three. Then, I can remember going to the  funeral when they were at the farmhouse and my grandmother sitting in  it. So, those are some stories I remember.  I didn   t know that was the history behind that rocker. I knew it was a  family heirloom, but I didn   t know     Yes, oh, my dad   that was the one thing he had to have when they  divided up the furniture was that rocking chair because it was a very  important thing in the history of his life.  And no idea of how he came to have it?  Yes, the daughter said,    He needs it. He   s the one that        No, but before that though how     Like how the grandfather got it?  Those are the details that I missed because I was so young and I was a  later baby. My mother was forty-five when she had me. I   m the only  child. So, any stories that I heard were just kind of mentioned along the  way. These are just the few of the little memories I remember about the  farm, actually. I know there was a barn. The house at that time, Dean  can tell you, it has been built onto now. We do have pictures. Cindy took  pictures of that house. But they had built onto it, I guess, two times?  Yes, you need to elaborate where it   s at though, Betty.  Oh, yes. Well, you tell exactly where it   s at. (Laughter)  Okay.  Because you know. I know what highway.  The house was one of the old, farm-type houses that had the porch all  the way around on all four sides of it. I   ve been doing a little research,  probably in the early    50s, was moved a mile and half south and a mile  and a half back east and put on a farmstead there. We just kind of  happened onto this, when we started doing this research, that that was  Betty   s old farmhouse that they had moved out there.  8  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  We   ve been out there a couple of times. There   s a family that lives in  there now, a farm family lives out there now, and they   ve just done some  remodeling to it. They didn   t disturb the structure of the old house.  They   ve actually kind of put an amendment to it. They   ve added a large  room onto it, but it   s still kind of the same, basic farmhouse. They   ve  done a little remodeling inside, but on the inside you can tell that it   s just  the old, basic farmhouse that started out with when Betty remembers it  on the farm.  It had what I call a rick-rack at the top of the porch, like in the movies,  Oklahoma. It looked like that kind of house. It was quite a nice house for  back in those days.  Two-story or one?  One story.  Well, no, it   s kind of a story and half.  Oh, can you go up there?  Yes, there   s kind of a little room in there, on the top. The two little  dormers come out and there   s kind of a little  space . I don   t think I   ve  ever been in the top story.  See, I   ve never been upstairs, but I thought those were fake dormers, you  know, the attic     No, there   s a little stairway that goes up in there.  I remember seeing the stairs.  Remember the stairwell, Cindy?  Yes.  So, how many rooms would   ve been downstairs?  There was a living room and a kitchen     Yes, I think it was just four rooms at the time.  Two bedrooms     Yes, two bedrooms     9  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall     and a living room        living room and a kitchen area.     and a kitchen area.  Indoor plumbing?  I guess it is now. (Laughter) And gas heating, I think. But back then     Was it indoor plumbing when you were out on the farm?  Probably not.  Yes, it was   Oh, it was?  It was.  Was it? That   s surprising.  I can remember visiting relatives in Garber that didn   t and that was my  first time to experience that. (Laughter) Later, I did experience it a time  or two, but I don   t ever remember that on the farm. But I do remember  relatives that lived in the Garber area, when we   d visit them, they had  the outdoor facilities. But the farm, that is something that I don   t  remember. I don   t remember seeing it or knowing about it. That   s a  question I   m not sure about.  Well, let   s back up a little bit. Do you know how your grandfather came  to Oklahoma or how he ended up in Logan County?  Yes, he married Alice R. McQuarter. How they met, I   m not sure, but  it   s predicted they met and married in about 1880. He was born in  Missouri and came to Oklahoma to do the Land Run. That   s how I  understand it.  The 1889 Land Run, the original one.  Yes, the original one. I did check with somebody from the area and I  asked them which Land Run because they told me there were two; one  later and the original in    89. They said,    Oh, no. Your grandfather did  the    89.    From what we can figure out he came, with two other brothers,  to do the Land Run, from different areas. He was born in Missouri, but  there was a family, original family     10  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Did he meet Alice after the Land Run?  No, he married her before, in the 1880s. I would imagine they all  came     Okay, gotcha.     and had the three children on the farm area. They were all born in  Marshall, which was the farm area. A strange thing happened. About ten  years ago, I got a letter from someone who said,    I think we   re kin to  each other,    and her name was Joyce Sebranek, from Garber, and she  said that her grandfather and my grandfather were kin. She did a lot of  research and she sent some pictures of the family and there was a  Samuel J. Beard and the wife was Francis Bland and they were from  Tennessee and Kentucky. They had nine children and her grandfather  was Samuel Bryan Beard and mine was Thomas B. Beard   two of the  brothers. There was another brother that, evidently, the three of them  came to make the Land Run, from information she found. She had  decided that we were kin because of what she found and so, she   s the  one that did a lot of research. She was trying to go all the way back with  the family to find out what country they came from    across the pond.     At that time, she had not done that. She was trying to find out a little bit  more about her grandfather and the family here. That   s when I found out  a lot about when my grandfather was born and then in Missouri and that  he died in Logan County, Marshall Township.  She evidently grew up, where I didn   t, in the area, in Garber. So, she  said that Molly, Daddy   s sister, and Bessie would visit her relatives and  they would tell what was happening with Thomas    family. I did not  know that she knew all about me. They talked about where I went to  college and she was two years younger. She said that every time they  would pass the farm, the Thomas Beard farm, that her mother would say,     Well, I wonder how Uncle Tom is doing today.    So, she said,    I just  assumed that we were kin to each other,    and sure enough, when she did  all this research going all the way back to 1822, we evidently are.  So, things happen kind of, in a funny way. She went to Oklahoma State  and I went to OU, but she knew all about what I was doing at OU and I  never knew her. I never knew about her. It was just family talking to her  family and I wish I had because we didn   t introduce ourselves to each  other, only by email, much later. I   m going to call her and see if she   s  done more research all the way back. That   s kind of an interesting thing,  how somebody is around here that is a distant, distant relative. I need to  meet her in person instead of just by email and by letter. She   s the one  that helped me a lot with the patent copies. Now, I had the old   what  11  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  are those called? The certificates they sent.  Signed by President Grover Cleveland?  Yes, that. I guess they gave the Land Run people that when they did all  the paperwork, the patent that I made copies of there.  And you have the original?  I have all the original of all that.  When he first bought the farm, did he raise cattle or do you know what  kind of   ?  I do know a little bit. He did raise cattle and he had the chickens, of  course. I remember where they got the water. They pumped the water, so  maybe that tells us something about the plumbing because I remember  the well. We have a pond on there, Dean can talk about that, that helped  with the livestock. Let   s see, what else do I remember? They grew wheat  and they grew all their vegetables and all that kind of thing. They were  pretty self-sufficient in everything they had there.  Once your father and then you took ownership, what   s raised on it?  Okay, Dean?  It   s still farming wheat and small grains and cattle, is what   s still  farming on the farm there. It was farmed after they got through farming  it. In the    50s, Jack Beebe rented the farm for a while.  He did?  Do you remember Jack?  I remember that now.  Jack   s the one that gave me   his wife gave me Prairie City     Oh, is that right?     from the     Charlotte?     what   s the name of that lady that wrote those?  12  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Miss Angie Debo.  Angie. Angie Debo. Mrs. Beebe, we went by to see her one time, said,     You need this book.    She said,    I   ve got an autographed copy of this  for you,    and inside she wrote,    I knew your family. They were part of  this Oklahoma history,    and signed her name to it. It   s an interesting  book to read. In there   s a picture. My dad went to school, grade school,  in the little, tiny school. They have a picture of some children standing  out in front. One of them looks just like my dad, about the age that my  dad would   ve been. Then, he used to tell me this. When he went to high  school, he went to Guthrie and he rode a horse and buggy to go to  school. He used to talk about how hard that was and how easy it was.  You know how the old days    (Laughs)  Yes, I think I   ve heard the same stories. (Laughs)  It always gets a little easier than it was in the old days. But then, they  wanted him to go to Guthrie so he could go to college. That   s why they  felt like he needed this education in the bigger area to go on to the  university school. So, they were very  education minded .  Now, Betty, did he go back and forth every day to school or did he stay  over there?  You know, I don   t know.  The reason I ask is because Guthrie is over a thirty mile trip from where  the farm is at.  Yes, I know. I know   And it   s not like going in a car where it just takes thirty minutes.  Can you imagine, in the cold weather?  Yes. So, I didn   t know if maybe he stayed with someone during the  week. Do you know?  He may have. You know how they all worked together.  Yes.  He may have done something for somebody and he could just stay there  part of the time, especially when the weather was bad because that   s a  long time to go back and forth every day, but that   s where he went to  high school. It   s somewhere in these records that I found that Joyce  13  Finchum  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  helped me with. I found that he went to high school in Guthrie and that  reaffirmed what he had told me. Then, of course, it didn   t say where he  went to college, but he majored in history.  See, this whole farm experience was really heavy on my dad. He loved  history and he loved farming. Because he got into teaching and coaching  in schools in Oklahoma, he never did go back, but it was always there. I  mean, he loved yard work and everything he could do for us. We had  vegetables in our alleys, if we had an alley, and he really loved that  whole experience. That   s why I think the sisters wanted him to have the  farm. They knew he loved it more than anybody else.  You were telling us what was happening in the    50s?  Oh, well, I think Jack started farming it in the    50s.  He started farming a long     Does that sound about right?  Before that. We moved during the war to Wichita Falls and I can  remember them talking to him. He only farmed percentage. They did the  percentage. So, Dad was knee deep in how much was in wheat and how  much was in what and they paid all the supplies and divided that up. So,  he took care of all of it and he paid the sisters. He was kind of the  administrator and he worked directly with Jack Beebe and he knew just  what he was doing. So, I think it was even earlier than that because we  moved  during  the war, I   d say in 1942, to Wichita Falls. I can  remember right after that, he was talking to Jack. They may not have  moved the farmhouse yet, but it was in their way.  I think they did right about then because just before that, when they  moved the house, before.  Yes, so they had the whole land to cultivate because no one was living in  the house and it was too nice a house just to sit there. I think it was a  little earlier, probably in the late    40s, middle    40s, and Jack Beebe was  the second.  Adolf Wolf farmed a few years before Jack Beebe, from  1940 to 1952. Jack and Duane Beebe farmed from 1952 to 1993, and  Dean Fuxa has been farming since 1994.   Jack farmed it, probably until 1980, when his boy, Duane Beebe, started  farming it. Remember Duane?  Yes.  14  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  And then I started farming it in about    95 to date, and I   ve farmed it to  date. That   s kind of been the history.  There was one before him     There was?     and I told you that. You mentioned his name. It was Adolf Wolf?  Vogel?  Vogel?  Adolf Vogel, yes.  Somebody   Wolf was his last name and when I was very young, he  may have done it for a year or two and then Jack     Before Jack?     Jack, yes.  Yes, I think that might be right because I talked to Duane and Duane  was pretty sure it was    52, maybe, when Jack took over     Now, he may have taken it over        from Adolf.     from   right. That   s right.  That   s probably correct.  So, there have only been three and Dean is the third and he   s been there  as long as anybody, I guess, taking care of it. I say he knows it better  than I do. (Laughs)  Is it still 160 acres?  It   s still 160 acres. There   s about 110 acres that are in cultivation and  there are another, about forty acres that is pastureland. Where the  homestead sat before, which you   d remember the homestead there, there  was a barn and then of course, the chicken coop out behind there and the  water well is still there. We don   t use the water well, but the old  windmill and water well is still standing out by the corral.  15  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  Finchum  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Yes, now I remember that. See, and that   s when I don   t know if they got  the   we went out and looked at that and I   d never seen that before.  (Laughter) That whole thing was an experience for me and I remember  the dramatic things, being so young about those things. I remember that  well and the windmill. First windmill I ever saw  (Laughs)  So, he   s had to keep up with books and all that for a long time, your  father?  Oh, yes. He did all of that. He loved it and he knew it. So, they worked  together and then, I guess, I was the first one that decided to go with  Jack Beebe on a cash-rent basis. Just let them do it all, pay cash rent and  then they do all the bookkeeping and all.  And work.  And work, yes. (Laughter)  Don   t forget that   All the work, yes, right. I was impressed with how well it   s kept by  Dean. The one surprise I had was when we drove up to it and he showed  us all around, took us down to the pond and everything, there were these  gorgeous longhorn steers out there. I guess I   d never seen young ones  that were so beautiful and I thought,    What in the world are those  longhorns doing on this property?    (Laughter) And I gave him a hard  time, but I really thought they were so gorgeous. I kind of expected to  see them the next time we came and I told the kids,    You   re going to see  real longhorns, like the longhorns in Texas     And they weren   t there.  (Laughter) Dean didn   t have them anymore, but I thought,    I can   t  believe these Oklahoma people driving by here will let those longhorns  stay on that property     (Laughter) It was kind of a funny thing for me. I  just didn   t expect it, but anyway. They are beautiful orange and white     deep, burnt orange, just like they say.  Well, how many ponds are on the 160 acres?  There   s one pond.  Just one?  One pond, yes.  Pretty good size.  Was it original or did the soil conservation folks come in and build it?  16  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Fuxa  I suppose they probably built it. Do you know for sure when it was? It  was probably way back there when they built the pond.  It   s way back. I remember them talking about it. There was an automatic  place for it and I think they just kind of worked it into a nice pond.  There   s a tree down there. It   s really a good place for cattle to drink.  Any creeks or streams?  No, it   s all pretty flat ground. There   s kind of a stream that runs through  that feeds this pond, that kind of runs through the field, but no, it   s all  pretty flat ground. There are not any creeks or anything running through  it.  Well, a lot of the early-day folks would look for water. It   s why they  picked the acreage that they did.  Well, he picked that out in that Land Run, evidently, because it is so  well located and it   s just the way it is now. It   s got the water on it. It   s a  beautiful piece of property.  And near what was the original capital.  Oh, yes. Well, Cindy got involved in that. She was an anchor with  Channel 8 in Oklahoma City.  Channel 5 in Oklahoma City.  Oh, it was 5 in Oklahoma City, eight in Tulsa. She was grand marshal in  Guthrie for their big parade celebration and we heard all the history  about the capital being stolen and taken to Oklahoma City. It was a fun  weekend to go to that celebration. She got involved a little bit in that.  That was a fun weekend.  So, how often do you get back to the farm?  Not too often.  Once every twenty years. (Laughter)  We did go last holiday. Now I sound like I   m from England,    We were  on holiday.    (Laughter) But last Thanksgiving holiday or Christmas  holiday   do you remember which one that was?  I think it was Thanksgiving.  17  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Thanksgiving?  Thanksgiving, and we brought my two kids. So, it was neat taking a  picture with three generations standing on that land. It   s really cool.  And Cindy has those pictures for you. She has the farmhouse and the  sign in Dean   s living room, with two children holding their sign that  we   re putting up. We   re designing the frame right now and we   re going  to do that after we leave here. Then we have one picture standing outside  by the road with the farm in the background with the three generations.  That   s what that picture will be that Cindy   s emailing to you.  Okay. So, we have Thomas and then he had three children, one of them  was your father and your father had one child, you. And then you have  one child?  See, it   s making it easy, isn   t it? Now it gets more difficult with her two.  (Laughter)  And then you have two. Okay. That   s usually the next question is what  do you see for the next 100 years?  We   ve talked about that and I had Dean written down for that.  (Laughter) One thing, as far as the family part, I   ve inherited property  from my dad because they always kept every house they ever bought.  So, I inherited those and I have two houses in Oklahoma City, had a  house in Enid that they got, never lived there. We never lived there, but  everybody in    29 had money in the bank that they didn   t get back and so,  the bank in Enid, because of money they had, they gave them the house  in Enid. They had property they had for mortgages and so, if people had  money in the bank   if they had quite a bit   they   d give them the house,  but that   s all they got. So, they got a house in Enid, which I inherited,  and two houses in Oklahoma City, and a house in Wichita Falls. Then  they ended up, my dad lived in Lubbock a short time. So, I ran all  these   oh, and one in Norman.  Dad  lived in Norman for a little while,  while we were in graduate school.  So, in dealing with all that, I have gradually sold some because I  managed them all and leased them all. It was quite hard from Lubbock,  Texas, because all of them were 350 on up, miles away. So, I would sell  one a year until I got them all sold except what we have in Lubbock.  That   s easier to handle and I said,    I put that money safe and you can  spend that, but you have to promise not to sell the farm.    So, Cindy   s  promised and we   re going to start working on her children, so it stays in  the family. That   s what we   re planning for the next 100 years. Now  18  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Dean can tell you what he sees, otherwise.  And I just want to say that my kids know that that stays in the family.  Do you have boys, girls, one of each?  A little boy and a little girl.  Okay.  Not so little. (Laughter)  Not so little.  Yes, eight and eleven now.  I don   t know if we ever told the location. The farm from  Highway  51  and  Highway  74 is a mile and a half north, on the east side of the road,  right off of Highway 74. So, it   s on an excellent location, being on a  major state highway up there. I suppose we   ll go ahead and keep  farming it like it is, as long as it   s profitable to stay farming. I was going  to ask you something. You said you had the house   I   m learning things  here myself     Yes, we   re both learning.     in Lubbock. Is that the house that your dad lived in?  Yes.  Oh, it is?  Yes, well, we finally pried him out of Norman. He did not want to leave.  Dick (Betty   s husband) graduated, PhD, clinical psychologist from OU  (University of Oklahoma) and he had to go out and try his wings  somewhere without all his friends and teachers and things. So, he goes  to Lubbock, Texas, to Texas Tech, to help them get the clinical training  program approved because they didn   t have anyone. They had clinical  psychologists in two of them, but they needed one in a certified program  like OU   s program in order to get their certification to start graduating  clinical psychologists. So, they worked on him a long time and we cried  and Daddy cried because we had bought him a house two blocks away.  Cindy was a baby and he loved to stay with her and it was a traumatic  experience to leave and go way out there and     She   s still trying to make me feel guilty about it. (Laughter)  19  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Forty-plus years later.  Oh, listen, it was hard  I was going to keep the house because I knew he  wouldn   t like it out there. He   s from Idabel, Oklahoma, with trees and  water and there are no trees and no water, unless you plant. So, I knew  he wouldn   t like it very long, with the dust storms and things. Well,  forty-four years, we   re still out there and it   s partly my fault because I  got acquainted and got established and I   d say,    Oh, let   s stay one more  year.     I tried to get them to move back to Oklahoma, so    (Laughter) But you  don   t live in Grandpa   s original house.  No.  Right.  We bought a house about two blocks away, so he could walk over and  see Cindy all the time. But prying him out of Norman and his Sooners  was really difficult. We just almost had to sell his house out from under  him and we did move him, literally, to get him to just leave Oklahoma.  That house, we did sell early on and we still own our house.  So, your father had a master   s degree?  Master   s degree in history, education and all that.  From OU?  From OU. And Professor Dale, he used to talk about all the time. He   s  the one they have the building with his name. Oh, he just loved him and  spent all his time trying to soak up everything about Oklahoma history  and any other kind of history he could find. So, yes, he talked about him  all the time.  Out of all the grandparents, he   s the one that I have the fondest  memories of     Because she spent time with him.     because I spent a lot of time over there and I remember he had this  music box that was an OU football that you could open and it played     Boomer Sooner.    (Laughter) I can remember, he or I one or the other,  would go wind it up and play it. He also had a silver foil Christmas  tree     20  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Yes, he did.     that turned around and had blue and green lights on it. For years, after  he died   and they can tell you this   anytime I   d watch a movie or a TV  show and they would beat up on an elderly man, I would just  hysterically cry because he just     He was a very kind, kind person.     a neat, neat man.  He was very easy going, low maintenance, just, you know     Unlike Mother. (Laughter)  Oh, yes. I   m totally different   Now, when they beat up on old men, your father    (Laughter)  Yes, he was very, very well liked and something interesting about him  was that they taught in Mulhall. They would rattle off these Oklahoma  towns that I see signs of. I   ve never been there. Well, they taught in all  these and they met that way, my mother and dad did. Dad coached girls     basketball. Of course, girls    basketball, back then, weren   t many places,  but Oklahoma had girls    basketball teams. They could only play half-court.  They didn   t think they could play full-court.  They were just women, right? (Laughter)  Yes, they were just girls, they couldn   t do all this. He loved sports  because he coached. I thought it was interesting he coached girls     basketball.  And this would have been when?  Oh, it was in the    20s, late    20s. I don   t think girls    basketball was very  big except Oklahoma. It evidently was in some of these little towns.  They had them, but they were small teams and they played half-court. I  think that   s kind of an interesting sideline. But, that   s why he didn   t go  back to the farm. He married a schoolteacher. He was teaching. That   s  kind of what they were doing and so, it just didn   t call to go back to the  farm to work it.  But he didn   t get rid of it.  21  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  He sure didn   t. He stayed knee deep in it as much as he could.  And he encouraged education for you?  Yes.  Did you attend OU as well?  I did. I did and     Midwestern for     What?  You went to Midwestern for a year.  Oh, I got a Master   s, also, of Education at Midwestern because Dick was  a graduate in the navy program from OU and of course, they had to go  immediately as a midshipman. They had to go in. They got their ensign  stuff. He was an ensign in the U.S. Navy and he reported to his ship in  California and called me and said,    Our wedding is going to have to be  put off because I am leaving for seven months on my ship.    So, I didn   t  want to go ahead and get married and just sit out there and know no one.  So, I was two blocks away in Wichita Falls from Midwestern   it   s  called Midwestern University now. I just got a Master   s in Education, so  I could make more money when I did go to California to teach and  Oklahoma to teach. Of course, I didn   t make very much in Oklahoma,  back then. (Laughs) I dropped two thousand dollars from the same job in  California, but it costs a whole lot more to live there so it equaled out.  We lived just as well in Oklahoma.  So, when did you graduate?  I graduated from high school in Wichita Falls High School in    54 and  OU in    58.  Now, I   m assuming you went to OU, too, Cindy?  I did. Third generation of my family to go to OU and I graduated in  1989. (Laughter) Since we   ve been talking about 1889.  I know, every once in a while, I forget what I say. I mean to say nineteen  and I   ll say eighteen because I   m thinking eighteen so much here.  You mentioned Angie Debo a minute ago. Did you meet her?  22  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Finchum  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  No, I did not. They just got the book for us.  She   s a very famous Oklahoma historian.  Oh, yes.  What is the book that you all are talking about?  Prairie City is what it   s called and I have it.  You have not shared this with me, so I don   t know anything about it   (Laughs)  No, I know. (Laughter) I   ll have to let you read that.  Okay.  Angie rode in on the Run in a wagon.  Really?  Really?  Yes, in Marshall.  See, I don   t know     And they settled there in Marshall and the book is about all the towns  that are settled right there. That   s why they call it   Marshall used to be  called Prairie City. She wrote several books. There are only three people  in the Oklahoma State Capitol rotunda. Sequoyah, Will Rogers and her,  I think, are the only three people that are pictured in the     She was the first woman.  Oh, wow   Very famous.  And she went to OU. She was an historian.  See, I did not know that.  Yes, she was an historian at OU. She did a lot of things. I knew her.  She   d come down to school, to Marshall School, sometimes and instruct  us a little bit. We knew Angie quite well. She was quite a person.  23  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Quite a character because more people have talked to me about her and  Mrs. Beebe just said,    You have to have this book.    So, she got it  autographed for me and everything. I thought it was just really nice of  her to do that.  I think she studied under Dr. Dale, too. So, there   s another connection.  See, there   s the connection.  Dale Hall, is that the same Dr. Dale?  Oh, yes  It   s the one they built. The new, big one that   s right on Lindsey  there.  Yes, I spent many a semester in there.  Well, see, that wasn   t there when I went to school. They had one but I  took history there, but it wasn   t like that. It   s a gorgeous new building.  I wish I had known more about the word Marshall because you all  always told me how it was outside of Guthrie. My daughter   s name is  Marlowe Ryan and we have relatives that are buried in Ryan.  Yes, my mother   s family.  Yes, Mother   s side of the family. And I might have worked Marshall  into Peyton   s name somewhere had I known that. (Laughter)  That   s kind of interesting.  It   s a great name.  Yes. I   m trying to think of any other interesting things I can think of,  about the farm that I can remember. I don   t know if there are any things  in little notes as I was reading through here. This is all her stuff there.  Where are they buried? Where is   ?  Okay, Dean helped me with that. You tell me what cemetery that was  you took me to.  Actually, there are two Marshall cemeteries. That cemetery that she   s  referring to is now called the North Cemetery. It   s just two miles out of  Marshall to the north.  24  Wall-Morrison  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  And that   s where Thomas and Alice   ?  That   s where Thomas     And Alice.     and Alice are both buried. Now where are your mom and dad buried?  Oh, my mom and dad, Wichita Falls.  Wichita Falls?  Yes. And my mother   s family is all in Ryan, Oklahoma.  They just bought their plots and I made them buy in Norman.  (Laughter)  I wasn   t ever thinking of Norman. Now, we lived there, during school  and graduate     I said,    We   ll be going to football games. We   ll come visit you. No  matter where we live in the country, we   ll come visit you.     When she said,    Well, we want you as part of our life.    I thought,    Well,  now, how do you answer that?    (Laughter) So, I guess I better think  close to where they   re going to be and the only place we know for sure  that they   re going to return at times would be Norman, to go back to  school to visit or to reunions or see football games. So, we did it this  trip.  I had to take a tranquilizer before all these trips, it was so exciting.  (Laughter)  Yes, he was so excited that we were going to rush up there to look at  cemetery plots. I think it kind of sold him when they said Toby Keith  was going to be     Me and Toby will get along okay. (Laughter)  Yes, Toby Keith is going to be buried here. He said,    Oh     He was more  interested then. (Laughs)  But I would love for them to move back to Oklahoma. They do have a  lake house at Grand and are here two weeks during Thanksgiving and  two weeks during Christmas and usually, a week or two during the  summer, but I would love for them to     25  D. Wall  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  The day after we win the lottery, we   re back  (Laughter)  But I would love for them to live here.  I   m sure Thomas would approve, too, if you were to live back in  Oklahoma.  Oh yes  Definitely, definitely, right, that   s right. Let me glance at these  just a minute and see if there was something else I found that was  interesting because we   ve covered a lot of it. We talked about the  porches and I think they heated by wood, the fireplaces back then.  Was there a cellar? Do you know?  I don   t remember a cellar being there. There probably was. There  weren   t too many homesteads that didn   t have a cellar, but I don   t know  for the farm where it would   ve been.  I   m amazed seeing the house now, what good shape it   s in. I mean, you  think about a house being built way back then and I know we have a lot  of old homes throughout the United States, but a farmhouse that   s  getting all the weather elements and everything else and a little while  people weren   t living there. I mean it   s just so well-built. It   s amazing.  And how they moved it. I would love to have watched.  Well, it is a very nice house. I was amazed it lasted that long to look that  good. He didn   t have the money to have a builder come in and build it,  so he had to have built it himself. I have a feeling they all shared and  helped each other in what they could do to build their houses back then.  Sort of like what you think of the Amish, you know, building a house,  helping each other.  Yes, because it is a beautiful place for a farmhouse. It   s just what you   d  want   just the pictures that you   d want and you   ll see it when you see  the pictures. In a little while, Cindy can just show you what you   re going  to get on your email. It   s quite a lovely picture of a house even after all  this time.  Well, farming sure has changed in 100 years or so, from mules to  combines and such. Do you have help doing the farm work or is it just  you?  Oh, we got a little bit of help in the summertime. I have some young  26  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  boys help me, but mostly just a family farm. I   ve got a father that just  passed away here about a month ago, but him and my brother, we kind  of stayed on the farm out there. Actually, I was born just a half a mile  south and a mile back west from Betty   s farm.  There   s the farmhouse (Gestures to photograph on computer).  See how pretty it is? Even to this day, it   s just a beautiful place, typical  farmhouse.  Makes you want to have Thanksgiving there.  Yes, doesn   t it?  Yes, yes  And then the pictures of     These are the two. It will take a minute to download.  Okay. I thought of something else. Now we got off the topic.  Here are my kids with the centennial farm sign. And then here are     That   s what Dean has in his living room for a year.     three generations. Here are three generations out on the farm.  Yes, you mentioned that you   d like to have that and I said,    Oh, we   ve  already done that.    (Laughs) We did that last year.  It   s pretty flat.  Yes. Parts of it were flat but there were parts, probably the pond and the  trees and     Well, it kind of goes up a little bit in the back. The back is a little higher  than the front, isn   t it? It seems like it, anyway. That wind was  blowing   Oklahoma wind, you can tell. Blown to bits out there, but it   s  right on the highway, so it   s easy to find and easy to see. I   ve got my  camera, I can take other pictures if you   d like because we   re going that  way. We   ve got to design the frame that holds the  sing  and where it   s  going to go.  When you actually hang it, take another photo.  Okay, okay.  27  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  Fuxa  Finchum  Fuxa  Finchum  Fuxa  Finchum  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  D. Wall  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Okay.  So, back in the day, they would   ve taken things to market. Would it have  been Marshall or Guthrie?  Marshall, yes.  Marshall.  Marshall probably would have been our local market.  And today, where do you   ?  Well, Marshall is becoming kind of a ghost town. We   ve still got an  elevator there, which is where we still haul our wheat. It still goes to  Marshall. They   ve got the post office and the elevator is about all that   s  left in Marshall.  Cattle, you take it to Oklahoma City then?  Well, or Covington. Covington has a livestock auction which is only  fourteen miles up the road.  Where   d your longhorn steers go? (Laughter)  I know it  That   s what I wanted to know. Where are they? I   ve told the  kids they   re here   Actually, we had a longhorn bull and some heifers out there and I was  breeding this longhorn bull to some heifers out there and so there was     It was a good looking animal.  Oh, gosh  They were.  Yes, remember the big, old horns he had? He had a rack     Oh, they were just like you would think      I bet it was probably nine foot from tip to tip of horn out there.  I know it. I said,    Can I get out of the car? That thing looks big      (Laughter) I now know. I see them at the Texas-OU game when they  drag that big, old thing in   but it wasn   t as pretty as these. And I wasn   t  as close either. (Laughter)  28  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Anything else you want to add before we sign off?  I think you covered a lot of the things I knew and I was amazed that not  being that old when the source died, my grandfather, that I could come  up with as much as I could. Of course, Dean helped a lot.  Dean has been a huge, huge help.  Yes.  This might be something. You didn   t realize this stuff until Betty kind of  went to researching this. We   ve all kind of went back and found some  things. We find that it might be interesting for everybody to kind of go  back and do a little research now, while there are a lot people are still  here that can help you with that.  Oh, yes.  A lot that, there   s nothing written down. Everything is just word of  mouth. You have to find someone that has lived in the area and knows  the people and so, maybe something like this will be very advantageous  for people to kind of document some of these things and maybe spur  some other people on to document some of the history of the local area  around here.  I think so. I   m going to call Joyce again and see what she   s found out.  She talked about doing this for her farm. She hadn   t done it and I said,     Well, we have done the centennial work and got it approved.    She said,     Well, I need to do that.    So, I don   t know what she   s done about it.  Did they go to church very much, do you know?  They went to the Christian church. The two daughters married two  Christian ministers. Does that tell you anything?  So, it was like the First Christian Church?  First Christian Church.  In Marshall?  Yes, and in that book, they talk about an outstanding preacher that is  from Disciples of Christ which is the Christian Church that was in the  area. It must have really made a difference in their religions in that area.  Do you know if it   s still there?  29  Fuxa  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  D. Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Actually, the Christian Church is still there. They just closed it here in  the last year and they had a nice building and they gave the building to  the community and now, the Christian Church is our community center.  Oh, neat   Oh, okay. Well, that   s a good way     It   s right there on Main Street. But Marshall had several churches. There  was a Catholic church, there was a little Gospel Lighthouse church, there  was an E R church, there was a Methodist church, there were several  churches in the little town of Marshall. One, two, three of them are still  open and two of them have been closed.  Well, the thing I was intrigued   it did mention some other ministers, but  it talked about this one that was really, very liked. It must have been  why they all went to that area because all of them were   like two people  marrying a preacher in the same church? Then Dad, I thought   we  could not go to any other denomination. Dick and I were married in the  Christian Church. Mother was a Methodist, but she said,    There is no  way he can be happy in the Methodist Church. He can only be happy in  the Christian Church.  Well, two things I wanted to mention. A, Dean has gone above and  beyond the call of duty     He certainly has.     because somebody who is working land is not generally going to go  do research and give us all this rich history back. So, I think that that   s     Oh, he   s wonderful.  Thank you for doing that for our family and for Oklahoma. I think that   s  really special and there was one other thing I was going to say. Oh, it left  me  But thank you to you.  I know. While you   re thinking about it, one question I always had and  I   ve asked a lot of people in the area, I asked Dean   was he a Boomer  or a Sooner? And I didn   t ask that  See, when my dad was alive I  could   ve checked on that. I have a farmer in the area that I talked to one  day, that called me and I guess they   re all researching and they knew  that we   ve done this. I asked him and he said,    Well,      and you may  know this too, being from the area,    The eighty-niner line was about a  mile and a half from our farm,    and that,    If he had been a Sooner,  30  Wall-Morrison  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Fuxa  Beard-Wall  Wall-Morrison  Finchum  slipped over the night before, that he would   ve gotten caught.    So, he  said,    I   m sure he was one that went when the gun shot.    So, that   s all I  know. It   s a big mystery   A role-player, I like that.  Yes, it   s a big mystery but he said he was too close to the line to be able  to get by with that.  He must have had a pretty fast horse. (Laughter)  He must have because I think he got one of the best pieces of land  anywhere around. Dean   s always told me it   s one of his favorites to  work.  Do you have more than one?  Yes, we farm quite a bit there.  Yes, he does others besides mine, I guess. But he has quite a big     Total acreage then that you farm   not necessarily own   but farm?  Well, we farm probably 320 acres just from her, from Betty   s farm. I  own a farm that   s actually, two and a half miles south, right on Highway  74, also. So, we   re kind of neighbors, pretty close.  We   re neighbors, we   re neighbors.  And we farm about 2000 acres, probably.  Can you believe that? That   s work   And I remember what the second thing is. I wanted to thank you for  doing this project. I can remember when I was in elementary school and  we went to stay with my dad   s mom. My dad   s dad had already passed  away and part of our school curriculum was we had to get   on cassette  tapes, which before long I   ll have to transfer that over, or we won   t have  anything to play it on   but I had to get all the history of our family as  part of this project. I loved that because I felt like I learned more about  my heritage and proud of where my family came from. Now, it   s  awesome to put the other half of that piece together from what you guys  started so, thank you.  Thank you.  31  Beard-Wall  Finchum  Beard-Wall  I think it   s a wonderful program.  It   s fun. So, thank you all for coming today.  Well, you are welcome. You   re welcome. We enjoyed it.  -------  -------
