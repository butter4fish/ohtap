 Nykolaiszyn and today is Friday, April 24, 2009. We  are here on the Blakley farm, in one of the first original structures. I   m  here with Mr. Bud Blakley. Thank you for joining us today. This oral  history project is being conducted as part of the Oklahoma Centennial  Farm Families Oral History Project through the Oklahoma State  University Library. I   d like to get started. Tell me how your family came  to this land.  Well they came here in 1907 and rode a train into Kendrick and they  bought the farm just prior to that. They had a team and wagon that  moved all their furniture out here and moved into this log cabin here,  this 14x18 log cabin.  Where did they originally come from?  They came from Illinois. We didn   t know a lot about them until the last  few years and we are learning some of the history.  Well tell me a little bit about them.  Well my grandpa, of course I knew him, he still worked in the field  some. My grandmother I didn   t know, she died before I was born. But  my dad moved back here to the farm in the late    20s and worked on the  farm until he died  in 1988 ; my grandpa died  in 1958 . They were real  hard workers. We grew up on the farm doing manual labor and did a lot  of farming, picking up pecans, baling hay, hoeing corn, peanuts, that sort  of stuff.  So the original acreage was how large?  When they first came here they bought 160 acres. And that   s where the  log cabin is at. And shortly thereafter, they built the frame house here  5  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  next to us. They built the lower story here first. Then a few years later  they jacked it up and put the underneath floor under now as it sets today,  as a two-story. My dad in the    40s put a porch on it and built a little  room on it. And we did several remodels on it, but the most extensive  remodel came this last year when we completely redid the house and  made another bathroom and fixed it up. Now my grandson lives in it. It   s  worked out pretty good. He   ll be the fifth generation that has lived in the  house.  So tell me a little bit about the building we   re in today.  Well, when I was a kid it was just an old log cabin. The underneath part  is the cellar and my mom filled it up with canned goods every year. We  filled it up with everything. We had everything farm- raised. We   d have  all our vegetables we   d put in, plus our blackberries and plums and some  of the things that we went out and picked in the wild. It just served as a  place for us to live and eat and they raised us kids. We worked hard.  Now we   ve tried to come back to it and find out a little bit about it and  it   s really been rewarding.  So this house has a unique history in terms of the family. How many  family members lived in here at one time?  When they first moved in here in 1907, there were seven kids and then  my grandpa and my grandmother. There were four boys and three girls  that moved into it and grandpa and grandma. Then a year or so later the  last son, Meryl Blakley who owned the B B store  in Kendrick  the last  time after the Blakleys owned it, he was born here. That made ten of  them living here then until they got the house over there finished.  Was anybody born in here?   In the house,  no, not that I know of, nobody was born here.  Mearla  was born in the log cabin.  All of us kids, I believe three of us were born  in the farm house.  And there   s also a well out back. What can you tell me about the well?  Well, it   s been there as long as I can remember. It   s just an old hand dug  well. It   s always had water in it from day one. And the spring right  below it   the spring leached out there and there was always water there  year round and it never dried out. And during the day, we used to fish in  it. I don   t know how fish got down in there, but we   d catch little fish out  of there when we was fishing here in the spring. Didn   t have much place  to fish so that was always a big thing when we had time.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  So to the best of your knowledge, can you describe the original layout of  the farm for me?  Originally, when they moved here they said that   it was pretty well  coated with timber. In fact the whole valley bottom over here that we  have in wheat now, that was all just solid timber. And they cut down the  trees and took dynamite and blew the stumps out and cleared the stumps.  I don   t know how long it took them to do that but probably not over a  year I don   t imagine. But they cleared that out and that   s where they first  started farming. I think some of the northern place that we bought later,  in 1917 they bought another 160 north of us here. Now the whole half a  section is together and they raised mainly cotton on it for years and  years.  And any cattle?  We had some cows and some horses when I was a kid. But it was all just  native grass and never was improved, so the upland grass was not that  good. The bottom ground we farmed, raised alfalfa and wheat and corn.  And we also farmed 160 to the south of us. The Bailey place from the  time I remember, we farmed it for several years. It raised just mainly  corn and alfalfa.  When you were raising cotton, did you help harvest it?  I did a little bit. I was pretty small. I was just probably small enough to  mess up everybody   s work. But you know, this big old tow sack you had  was bigger than I was. I remember I wouldn   t get my sack very full and  Dad would kind of get on to me. My brother three years older would fill  his sack up. I do remember pulling that sack   crawling on your knees  all day was not an easy job. It was very hard work. We had a lot of it. I  don   t know how many acres we had, but lots and lots of cotton all over  both places. So we had a lot every year to pull. Some of it we picked, but  most of it we just what they call pulled or pulled the bowls off and threw  it in. We had a cotton gin then in Kendrick so we were able to just take it  right up to Kendrick and get rid of it after we picked it and sell it.  Did you have any other chores that you had to do as a kid?  Yes. We had plenty to do, my dad worked very hard and he wanted  everybody around him to work hard. So when we were young   about  six is the most cows that I remember us milking. And I usually milked  one, my brother one or two, and my dad at least two or more. We all got  up well before daylight and had the milking done and over with and  usually back to the house by the time daylight was here. Had breakfast,  then it was off to something else in the field.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  So they got you up pretty early in the morning.  Always got up  early in the  morning and stayed up late. That   s when I  got into playing sports and stuff in school. Dad did let us participate in  all that. And you know we might have to work that night after the  basketball game or baseball game was over, we   d go to the fields and  work. We also farmed some other land up by Kendrick and up north of  Kendrick. So we really had 700 or 800 acres that we actually farmed.  And all we had at first was a little bitty A-Farmall tractor. Then we got  an H-Farmall tractor  in the    40s  which is still sitting here. We   re  getting ready to have it restored. It   s been in the family since the    40s  and the little A   s been here at least since the    30s.  So do you remember the first time you learned how to drive a tractor?  Not exactly the first time. I know we were driving a tractor when we  were very young, I want to say eight or ten years old. Dad showed us  how and then he expected us to get on and do it. My brother and I both  made manual hands when we were very young. We   d work out for other  people and he   d always lecture us how you   re going to be doing my job  today, you   ve got to do a good job. And we tried. And then work was  fun. It wasn   t as hard as it sounds.  Now your father was primarily a farmer or did he do other things?  He was mainly just a farmer. In the early    50s he had a brother-in-law  that was a carpenter, a very good carpenter, who married his sister. They  lived out east of Kendrick and he started doing carpentry work. And my  dad and my uncle who lived with us then, Glen Blakley, they all three  worked together. So when I was a kid, in the summer time, we got to do  a little bit of roofing, and a little bit of carpentry work building some  houses and stuff. So I kind of got the start that I have today in the  business. And then I went to the Service (Navy) and came back  in  1959 ; I couldn   t find any jobs so I went back to carpentry. I   ve  basically been building houses for 50 years.  So you   ve seen a lot of change in the area. You   ve been right there on  the front lines.  Yes. Then we had another uncle that lived up here in our north place and  back to the west there, the one that was born here in this log cabin. They  had seven girls. And they lived there a while, and they lived there on our  place for a while. And then we had people a quarter or half mile around  us. There were other families   there were 15 or 20 families out in this  area. And today there are only two of us left in a two mile place. So not  near as many people as there used to be.  8  Finchum  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  So what was school like?  School? Well we thought it was terrible having to go to school. I mean  we liked going. My brother and I were both sports people. We played  baseball and we played basketball and I ran a little bit of track. We   d get  up and do our chores in the morning. We still had to do all our chores. A  lot of times we   d ride a school bus and a lot of times we   d just run to  school. It was only a mile and a half up to town. You know then we  could run up there in just a few minutes, just take off running. Of course  when it was muddy we   d ride the bus. We didn   t like to run in the mud.  But the old hill here north of the house used to be a really tough one. It  was really, really hard to get up and down in the rain because it was all  clay and no gravel whatsoever. It was pretty tough times.  Were you in 4-H?  Yes, I was in 4-H for a while in grade school. I may have been in it even  a year or two in high school. Oh we had a few things, I had chickens. I  think I had hogs a year or two. We also raised hogs on the farm. We did  some demonstration stuff in the county. But my heart probably wasn   t in  to it as good as it should have been and I never did do real well in it.  Did the county agents come?  Yes, the county agents used to come out and then as I left home, got  married, and my kids got into FFA in Davenport, they   d come a lot to  the farm here to help my dad and do things through my dad. He was  very supportive of them. And today we   re really supportive of both 4-H  and FFA programs in Lincoln County. Been in business all these years,  we   ve supported them each year.  Did you do much conservation efforts?  Yes, quite a bit in the early day. I guess my dad in the early day started  putting in terraces. That   s what he did around the county. He worked for  the county and did terraces for a lot of different people. But he also had  this place here all terraced. And he did that, of course, with a team and a  little doodlebug is what we called it, we   d run it as kids, cleaning out the  spring here and everything. He   d run in there and hold it there until you  get out then you   d dump. Then you   d go back and get another little  scoop. Believe it or not, in a year   s time I guess they moved a lot of dirt  because this place probably had 100 terraces on it and all the water  drained around like it was supposed to. Of course when we came along,  we had a dozer so we pushed all the terraces out and strigged it all in  Bermuda grass. Today you don   t have that, you can drive anywhere on  the farm. We had a lot of ditches. Erosion ditches were really bad on the  9  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  north place in the early day. And when we took over the farm we filled  all that in and leveled every bit of ground on the place, every single bit  of it, and put in Bermuda grass. Most all of it today you can just drive  anywhere on it with your eyes closed, you don   t have to worry about  falling in a ditch.  Since we   re on that topic, tell us a little bit about your ponds.  Now we have 11 ponds. In the early day we had one pond. I think my  dad built the one here on the road going towards Kendrick. I think he  built that in maybe the   I believe probably in the    40s. Then we had one  old pond down below there that was built way in the early day that we  fished in. Those were the only two ponds on the place. The rest of them  were built in the last 20 years.  With the purpose being   ?  Just for agriculture purposes for the cattle. When we started buying them  in    83, we started cross fencing it and now we have it all blocked off in  40s  40-acre sections . Four 40s are blocked out and two of those 40s are  blocked off into 20s. And we have a pond on all of them except one and  we still have one pond to build. We   ve been awfully busy in the  construction business in the last few years, and hopefully this year we   ll  get to that and get a pond built. It has a creek through it so most of the  time there   s water in the last pond and we don   t need it, but we still need  it when it gets real dry like it was a couple of years ago.  So you have cattle as your primary     Yes, my dad had cows in the early day. We came along and bought this  and I didn   t think I   d ever come back to the farm. But when I got here  and saw the need for some cows to graze the grass, when we planted it  all in Bermuda grass and started harvesting it, it fed a lot more cows. So  now we   re running almost 100 cows on the place. I think we have  almost 90 calves now, the last fall cows and the spring cows. So we   ll be  selling cows every month or two and then again in the fall.  So tell us a little bit about the barns on the land, from the old to the new.  In the early day we had a great, great big barn. I think they built that  barn real soon after they got here. In fact, I   m almost sure they did. And  it was a tremendous barn. It was probably 40 x 60 and it was probably  eight or nine foot downstairs. And the downstairs was all horse stalls,  almost all of it. Probably take care of 12 horses at least. And the upstairs  was one big open loft. And in the early day, they had a boon that came  down and picked up the loose hay. In the early day, they always just  10  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  brought the hay in and picked it up loose and took it up there and  stacked it in the loft. I remember we used to have a horse they   d hook up  and this horse would walk from all the way down to the barn, all the way  up to this fence. My dad would just sit up there in the loft and whistle or  call and when he   d holler    Gee    or    Haw    or whichever they meant,  they   d turn around then and walk all the way back down. They were  trained just professionally. You couldn   t believe it how great they were  trained. So that   s how they got their hay up into the loft. And when they  got down, I guess they threw it down   I think they just threw it down by  hand. Down below, they   d get pitchforks and put it in the stalls for the  horses.  We also had some corn cribs here; in the early day we had a lot of corn.  We shelled a lot of corn dropping an ear at a time in. We had a big  sheller here. And I remember sitting out and doing that. That was hard  work for several hours. My dad had a little blacksmith shop here. He  was very good with making different metal parts and bending and stuff.  He   d heat that up and fix cycles for the mowers and hoes and rakes and  all the shovels   everything that needed worked on. He could about build  anything out of a piece of metal.  And then today?  Today. Well it   s all changed today. We came in in the early    80s and  started clearing the timber off because the timber just grew up and  hadn   t really been farmed very much in the last 20 or 30 years. After my  dad got older, he just went to cows mainly and had a little bit of wheat  and that   s about all he had. So we went in and cleared all the trees out  except pecan trees and left them. And of course we ended up with the ice  storm here a couple years ago. It did so much damage and we had to  clean those up, had an awful lot of clean up doing that. When we  counted up we had 900 pecan trees. A couple years after we got them all  cleaned up we had a good pecan crop and sold off about I believe it was  28,000 pounds of pecans that we sold. And probably in the early day  when we used to pick up two or three trees on the place that weren   t  covered up with other brush, we might get three or four sacks of pecans.  In the early day my uncle had a place here to the south that had a big  pecan growth on it and we used to go down there and pick up   that   s  something else we did, we farmed it. And it had a hay meadow and lots  of pecan trees. We picked up pecans when we had a pecan crop and of  course we would bag them up in gunny sacks and bring them here to the  house and take them in and sell them.  Well back in your father   s time and your time, how would products get  to the market?  11  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Well of course then, my dad   started baling hay maybe even before I  was born. But when we came along we baled hay commercially and we  baled for ourselves and for other people. We had this little pick-up baler  we called it. My brother and I rode and tied it and some bales come out  the back. We did this from the time I was in the school, probably from  the fifth or sixth grade through high school. At this big barn we had  we   d store several thousand bales up in the loft. I mean it was huge. Of  course we used to have to throw that up in the loft and get up there and  stack them. It was probably 20 or 25 tiers high in the loft because it   s so  big in the middle and built extremely well. Big 6x8 and 8x10 timbers is  what supported it underneath, so you could put all the weight in the  world up there and it wouldn   t hurt it. That   s how he did it.  Just over the years a lot of hay went to Texas. I guess it was dryer down  there and they needed more hay. They had semi-trucks come in here and  they   d load it out, you know 300-400 bales on a truck. Throw it out one  bale at a time and stack it. My dad did that for years and sold hay. That   s  how most of it got to market. And we used a lot on the farm. We fed  some of that to cattle. We ground our own feed, we had a grinder  hooked on a little tractor. We   d run that little hammer mill usually every  two or three weeks, Saturday mornings usually. We   d grind up hay and  other things we had to put in it and make ground hay out of it. That   s  how he fed his calves; we didn   t buy anything. Hardly ever bought  anything from a store. We were almost self sufficient, I would say 95-  98  on the farm, everything.  And today your cattle are not pets?  Well     Or a little bit maybe?  Some of them are. You know you try not to make them pets. It seems  like we developed some that are pets. Of course the grandkids they come  out and they want to feed everything and it   s all fun to them. We have  some that come up and eat out of the pick-up when you hold a cube out.  Now the last three or four years we   ve got some donkeys. We have a  little baby donkey now. Of course that   s about the main thing for them  coming to the farm now is to get to see the donkey. We   ve got this cute  little black donkey and everybody that hears about it has to come see it.  It   s a dandy.  Do you have round bales of hay now?  Yes, pretty well all round bales now. A few years ago I baled up one  field of square bales. I thought it would make 300 or 400 bales. I don   t  12  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  know much about farming like my dad did and I thought we   ll just bale  it all. We had fertilized it really good. I think it made 1700 and some  bales, this one field. We   ve got a barn out here and we filled it plum full  of hay and that lasted us until this year. We just fed the last few bales out  today. So I may bale a few square bales this year but most of it we hire a  person to do it and he just bales round bales. We usually have 300-400  bales a year, if we have enough moisture.  You spoke a little bit about the tractor you   re getting ready to restore in  the next couple of years. Do you have any of the old farm equipment still  on the property?  Yes, there   s some down there by the barn. We still have some horse  drawn stuff there. When we had the farm sale here, my dad   s estate sale,  we sold most of the stuff off. Most of it wasn   t very good then. It was all  the old horse drawn stuff, it just laid outside for 30, 40, 50 years. Some  of it is wagon wheels and stuff. My son bought some of them and left  them here on the place, so we   ve got a few pieces here stacked around  the barn to let people know what it used to be like.  Well when you were growing up, like ten years old, did you have a  favorite room?  I guess our favorite room was our bedroom upstairs. We only slept in it;  we   d come in, go up there late at night and get up early in the morning.  Back then the old house was real, real open and very, very cold. The  whole time I was in school all we had was a wood stove and that   s how  we had to farm. You   d hear my dad up at 5 o   clock every morning  building a big old fire. We had this big old wood stove there in the living  room. And he   d get it so hot you couldn   t stand around it. But it didn   t  do much for the rest of the house. I remember some nights we   d even  have broken windows, you know. I don   t know if it was because the  windows were up high or if we didn   t have the money, but sometimes  we just stuck towels in those windows, stuffed the holes up. But when  the snow would come, sometimes it would blow the towels out and blow  snow in on our bed. I remember more than once waking up with snow  all over the top of my brother   s and my bed.  So did you have a favorite family meal from when you were growing up?  Well my mom was a great cook, but I guess maybe one of the most  famous things that we had here was her homemade bread. She made  bread at least two or three times a week. She made the big loaves and  she might make seven or eight of those loaves. Then my brother and I  when we were coming in, grade school, high school age, we   d come in  and if she   d let us, most of the time we   d eat a whole loaf apiece. We   d  13  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  just take a loaf of bread, smear a little butter on it, and that   s all we   d eat  on it. No jelly, no nothing. But very, very good when it first comes out  of the oven.  And holidays?  We went to church real regularly. Sundays, we always went to church.  All my life I grew up in the church. Dad was real strict on that. Like  Fourth of July and some of those days we did not work. We   d take off.  And we were like all kids. My uncle owned the store here. We could  always manage to get a few firecrackers out of the store and had a great  time shooting them. And fishing was a big thing. When it rained real  hard we couldn   t work the fields. That   s the only time Dad would take  off and go fishing. We used to take off and go down on the creek or  down on the river. And you know, we   d catch a lot of fish to eat. Back  then, everything we caught we dressed to eat and would bring them  home. We grew up on a lot of fish.  Talk a little bit about siblings, where they are now; bring us up to date.  My immediate family, I have one older sister (the one that was here in  the picture a while ago) that had a station in Kendrick. She graduated  here from Kendrick. She went on to Oklahoma City and worked. And  then from there, her husband was in the Navy in Norman. They met and  they went back and lived in Baltimore. They just have one son. Now she  broke her hip a couple of years ago and she   s had a tough time  recovering. But she   s been a diabetic for several years. She worked for  the Army for years and years and then in the Department of Army  Research where it used to, when she   d come here on vacation well the  FBI would always come around for three or four weeks after she was  here and go to everybody and see if she talked to anybody. She would  never ever say anything about where she worked because she worked  at  the  Army Chemical Center and I guess a lot of stuff she wasn   t  supposed to talk about she didn   t, she was very good about it. But  anyway, she retired from there and they both still live in Baltimore,  Maryland. They   re both up in their high 80s and they   re not in very good  health, but all of us are getting that way.  My older brother, next to my sister, he lives in Fort Worth now. He  graduated from Oklahoma State University, got a degree there in 1955.  He worked in the ASC office in Texas and ended up director of 14  southern states. But now he   s retired and he   ll probably live in Fort  Worth the rest of his life. My younger sister, they used to travel around  all over the United States. Her husband went to OSU also and got a  degree in cooking and serving in big hotels and restaurants and  managing them. He   s been with Hilton and all the big ones all over the  14  Finchum  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  United States. They ended up in Georgia where they bought their own  business. Then after she left down there, she went and worked in Texas  and Kansas. Now she   s back in Georgia, retired. She has MS and her  health is not real good. She has to be in a wheelchair but she still  manages to do things with her kids and grandkids. And then of course  there   s me and Sue. We live in Lincoln County. I left here in    55. I spent  five years in the Navy and then came back and went to work in the  construction company in    60. I   ve been here, it   ll be going on 50 years  that I   ve been building homes and remodeling and it   s all I know.  Have any of those been back here recently?  My brother comes. He still has 80 acres here next to the farm. We talk a  lot. He comes back usually two or three times a year. He   ll come back  for a day or two. He likes to go down on his place and just hang out  down there and you know, shoot his guns and do target practice and  stuff. My older sister hadn   t been back in four or five years. They used  to always come every other year and my mom and dad would go out  there every other year. So they saw each other once a year. My youngest  sister, she used to come two or three times a year but she hasn   t been  here either due to her health. It   s harder for her to travel now than what  it used to be. She   s got a handicap van she drives in Atlanta and  anywhere and goes everywhere. But it   s got to be tough on her getting  around. We hope to get around and go see her this year.  And then what about your father   s brothers and sisters?  Well, of course they   re all deceased now. But my dad   s oldest brother  had the B B Store here in Kendrick. He started out in the bank there  where his first wife   s parents owned the bank and he kind of inherited  that. Then from that he went and bought the B B Store and they owned  it for 43 years, I believe. Then when he died he lost  in his will  to his  brother, Merrill Blakley. When my uncle was working there in the store,  why they were real hard workers too. We used to go there every night.  Every single night we   d go there and talk. My dad would help him  sometimes in the store. Then my mom   s mom and dad lived in  Kendrick, grandpa Sutton on that side of the family had a stroke when I  was pretty young and we went to their house every night for eight or ten  years. Most of the time we   d stay all night with them, or some of us  would and we   d come back to the farm the next morning and Dad would  go to work. Then some of the other brothers would come out here. One  of the older boys was Glen Blakley. He worked in Northern Oklahoma  and Kansas in the oilfield all his life. All of them lived to be pretty old.  My uncle Glen, the one I just talked about in the oil field, he lived to be  93. I believe he was the oldest male. And two of the older girls lived to  be in their 90s so all of them lived to be in their 80s and 90s.  15  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  One of the things I didn   t say about my uncle who had the B B Store,  Leo Blakley who was a professor at OSU, the Dean of Economics up  there for several years. One morning his son was going out to get part of  a beef and bring it in to cut it up. He   d asked my other uncle to get it for  him and he said just a minute. He was finishing up his conversation and  my uncle was kind of like my dad, they couldn   t wait for nobody, they  had to work. So he went out and got the beef and brought it in and threw  it down on the chopping block and he fell dead down on top of it. He  died there in the store. He   d had a bad heart and everybody had wanted  him to retire. But he had talked to me and he said,    Bud, I   d rather die  than have to go home and sit down.    And I said,    Well work if you feel  like it.    And he worked for ten years after he wasn   t supposed to. But he  lived to be 78 with a real bad heart, so he did very well.  Both of his sisters were Postmistress here in Kendrick and both of them  had the Post Office in Kendrick for years. One of my other uncles  moved off and worked oilfields in Oklahoma. But now they   re all gone.  Just what I call the third generation. And when I bought the farm, there  were 23 cousins that owned the farm because the whole 320 acres was  undivided except the 40 here where my mom and dad lived. They owned  that. We ended up buying it from the 23 cousins and it was a long  ordeal, but we got it all done here a few years ago. Now we own it, me  and the bank own it.  It   s impressive that all that started from just one room here.  Yes, it all started here in this 14x18 room. A lot of the kids, my  generation, I guess that would be the third generation, a lot of the fourth  generation they live all over. The Blakleys that live north of Kendrick,  all of them ended up in California in later years. But in the early day  Kendrick was represented well with Blakleys. I know up here at the  store where they had the pictures of all us in graduating classes, I don   t  know how many Blakleys are in there, probably eight or ten cousins, and  their pictures that graduated from Kendrick. As far as I know, every one  of them went to Kendrick. And I think maybe every one of them  graduated.  One thing I didn   t talk about, we used to have a little country school  over here on the home place, over there on the corner. No remnants of it  there now except a little bit of cement. But my brother went to school  there his first and second year and then they closed it. It was just a little  one room school there, I don   t know how big it was, it wasn   t real big. It  was kind of a neat place. Of course over the years it was blown down or  torn down or something. Not there anymore.  What year and what was the condition of this place that we   re in right  16  Blakley  now before you decided to remodel it?  Well, when I was a kid growing up, of course the roof was on it and it  was in pretty good shape. We used to raise pumpkins. We had a window  upstairs and the thing I remember more than anything is throwing those  pumpkins up there through that little bitty window. We   d have at least a  wagon load, maybe more sometimes, that would fill the whole upstairs  full of pumpkins. And I guess they just kept them up there until either  winter was over or they rotted. Of course then, everything we ate was  from raw pumpkin, we didn   t know what a can of pumpkin was. Mom  would get pumpkins and make pumpkin pies all the time. That was kind  of a neat thing to watch growing up. But once I came along and after dad  kind of patched it up and put some tin on the side of it to keep it from  rotting, I kept looking at it ever year after I bought it. Then it was getting  pretty rotten up on top and I kept thinking that maybe I would fix it up. I  thought about the costs, well maybe I can   t afford to. But I sent a boy  that works for me, Richard Simon, out one day. I asked him,    Richard,  go out and see if you can tear that old log cabin down. That   s terribly  dangerous. Kids are likely to get out there and have that fall on them.     He come down here and he was banging on the roof with a back hoe  trying to knock it in. And I guess it   s so solid   we just thought it was  rotten   it wouldn   t knock in.  My son was living here then. He was upstairs sleeping. He was a nurse  in Oklahoma City at that time and he lived here. He came running out  here and asked him what he was doing and he said,    Well your dad said  tear it down.       I don   t want to tear that down, I want to save that.    So he  pulled off and we let it go a few years and then we decided to take it  down and fix it up. And three years ago now, I guess it was, we tore the  roof off and fixed it all up and we kind of fixed it up. It probably took us  most of the year. A rock layer that worked for me laid us up a fireplace  on the outside and the carpenter that I got working for me now, he did  some Walt Disney stuff in Florida and built some of these old cabins.  When I talked to him about this, he said,    Oh yeah, I can do that. I used  to do that for Walt Disney.    We tore the logs all down to about two foot  high and took all the shims out then put them back, chinked it all in with  cement. We sprayed a sealer on the outside thinking that would seal it  and make it last a little bit longer. We went back to the old native heavy  wood shake, as rough as we could find. They should last 30 years or so;  that   s about all we can do to it. I believe the outside will last. It   s been  pretty good. The window we   ve got in   we put one of the windows  back in, they were all gone   it came out of the house when we  remodeled it back in the    40s I believe, out of the frame of the house. So  that window was out of the house. And we bought one of the doors from  an antique dealer and then of course the other one we had to put in new.  We left the original stairway and a closet. It   s just exactly like it was I  17  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  guess in 1889 when they built it.  And even in the cellar, you could see some of the original logs.  Yes, see we were going to knock all of them out. In fact we tried to drive  a nail into it and everything. They were solid, right on this corner, right  up here just a little bit. So we blocked that up and just left them all in  there. And you know, you can see here how close they are. They are less  than two foot apart. And we found some old cedar we had there in the  yard that had been laying there maybe 15-20 years. It was weathered and  kind of had a dark color to it and we thought, oh boy, that   d be perfect.  Did we even stain that? I don   t think we did.  Well early on, how were property lines marked?  In the early day, all there was were just old fences that I remember, all  out of wood. As far as I know, there weren   t any stone markers on it that  I remember, rock markers. But all the fence lines and all the posts were  made out of bodark cut posts. They were here, even some of them, when  we started redoing the fences here in the    80s and I know they   d been up  oh, for sure 50, maybe 80 years. And those old posts never rot out, they  just won   t. They just stay hard forever. They were just old crooked yoke  type posts, you know. Nothing pretty about them like the old farm was  in the early day. It looked like the Dust Bowl stuff. But Dad would just  go along, stretch a little more wire out and drive in a few more staples. It  kept our cows in and that   s all we had to worry about.  Did your father worry about record keeping back in the day?  No, there was no record keeping. A little bit in his book maybe but it  was just kind of like mine, it was just all up here. You know I say,     Yeah I made money on them cows last year.    But he worked out all of  his life, you know. He made more working out than he could ever make  thinking about farming so I don   t think he really ever made any money  farming. But he did provide a good living and good food for us as we  were growing up. We always had clothing to wear and we always had  food and plenty of it; we never went hungry. The people I went to school  with in Kendrick, a lot of them went hungry. A lot of them weren   t as  well off as we were. I think we were all poor then, but nobody knew  that. We were all alike. We   d wear jeans until they had big ol    holes in  the knees. And we   d wear our shoes until the toes punched out the front.  But Mom always made us wear clean jeans. That was one thing, we  never went dirty, but we didn   t always have good clothes.  Was there a difference between what the girls did and what the boys did  for chores?  18  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Well, of course my sister was quite a bit younger than I was. She was  about seven years younger than me so she was kind of just a little  spoiled kid. Being the youngest I would say that she didn   t have to work  as hard as we did. She thinks she did when you talk to her,    Oh, Mom  made me       We were talking the other day about plucking chickens,  what you do to pluck a chicken. I used to have to kill 50 of them for  Mom to clean and butcher. And she said,    Oh I told Mom I wasn   t doing  that.    Boy, I wouldn   t have thought about telling Mom I wasn   t going to  do something. That was all part of growing up was raising a big garden  and everything.  Well do you remember any piece of advice or words of wisdom that your  father passed down to you about running this place?  Well I probably didn   t listen very good. He said I didn   t, cause the one  time he was telling me   when he was running the station there in  Kendrick, he ran the station all day then he would load a car load of  cotton at night. His brother helped him some and sometime he had to do  it by himself. He was supposed to get one car a night out, so he had to     you know it all had to be pitch forked. It   s all it could have been. Just  loading a whole car load. And that was a lot of cotton. I don   t know how  much, but a lot. He   d quit at about five or six at the station and go down  there and work. He said,    Sometimes I   d get back at five, five-thirty in  the morning. Sometimes I wouldn   t get back until I had to open, maybe  seven.    This went on   I guess he probably didn   t work Sunday. But that  may have gone on five or six days a week, the whole time he was  running the station there. And that   s how he worked, to be able to  survive.  But he told me one time, I said,    Dad how come you didn   t talk to me  about saving that money?    He said the reason it come to that, he said,     You know when I was making a dollar a day back in the Depression,  we always tried to save a dime.    I said,    How come you didn   t teach  me?    He said,    Maybe you didn   t listen.    I liked spending that money   Still do  We   d work all summer. After we were in about seventh or  eighth grade why we paid our way from then on. We worked during the  summer and would buy our clothes and we just spent the rest of it during  the year. By the time the fairs were gone, by the time I made the county  and state fair, mine would just about be gone.  What did you do for fun when you weren   t working?  Oh, we swam a lot. We   d go to the ponds. That was always a big thing.  My dad put a big diving board over there in the    40s. When I was a real  little kid, we used to go and there   d be 50 or 60 people. Kids from  Kendrick would come out on Sunday afternoon and swim. We pretty  19  Finchum  Blakley  much always did that and we rode horses a lot. We always had a horse. I  had a horse named Tony when I was growing up. I rode him  everywhere. You know I   d go to town at night and I   d tie him up, he   d  slip his bridle off and I   d have to walk home. He   d never come home  without me. He   d stop right here in front of the house and wait for me.  He   d be there when I got there and I   d get his bridle and put it on him  and come on home. I never did tell Dad that he slipped the halter off  because he   d gotten after me; he thought I was tying him up there and he  was staying. But it didn   t matter how tight I tied him, he could get that  thing off.  But Sunday afternoon, we raced horses. If anybody wanted to race, I   d  ride anything so they   d let me have their horse and we   d pair up with  somebody else. We   d line up somewhere and away we   d go. Ride  bareback, that   s all we had was bareback and wide open like a race  horse, just fun. I got bucked off, thrown off, run over, and everything  else. But I   m sure lucky I never got hurt on one except one time I was on  crutches. Back then we didn   t have a doctor   we had one but we didn   t  go   and I fell off a horse one time and the horse rolled over on me. I  couldn   t get around for about four or five months. Then my uncle had a  pair of crutches at the store so we   d go get the crutches when somebody  got hurt. I hobbled around on them for a long time during the summer  time. I think I went to school a month or two in the fall. That   s just the  way it was. We kind of did with what we had.  A little bit along that same line, did you have any home remedies?  Oh, probably not, none of my own. Mom had all of them and Dad had  all of them, you know. Dad chewed Beech-Nut all the time. And if you  got stung by a bee he   d slap that on your lip or wherever it was, a big old  hunk of that chewing tobacco. He   d just hold it on there. One time we  were down in the bottom hunting and he said,    See that rabbit?    I said,     No, I don   t see it.       Go a little bit left, little bit left.    I got just about  right and he shot this big old wasp nest down and it drifted down on me  and stung me three or four times. And he just laughed. He sat over and  laughed up at a storm. And they just stung me all over my face and  everything. It was starting to make me sick you know, I was just hurting  up a storm running around there. I was probably eight or nine years old.  And he said,    Come here.    I got over there and he took all that out and  packed it on my face and made me lay down. Oh that stung so bad   that  was a lot worse than the wasp sting   Oh anything to have fun. We used to have the kids out in Kendrick, we  were always pulling stuff on them. We had a lot of tricks we   d pull on  them. We   d ride horses along and the person up front would pull the  limb back, turn it loose, and knock them off their horse you know, that  20  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  was fun. We   d rope each other like cowboys and Indians. We did that all  the time. That was just a day   s fun, you know. Jerk each other out of the  saddle. But we never got hurt. I guess we were just lucky.  You lived close to Route 66, do you have any stories about that?  No, not too many. We   d go to Davenport, that   s closest to us, or  Chandler. When I got older, we went to Chandler on Saturday evenings  sometimes and we   d go to the show. They had a show there so we   d  always go to the movie show on Saturday night. I think it was a dime  and maybe a dime for a sack of popcorn. And Mom and Dad went to a  little grocery store there, bought their groceries and sat around and  talked on Saturday night. The rest of the time they went to Kendrick, but  on Saturday night they went to Chandler. I guess some of the fun things  I remember about  Route  66 have been in the last few years when they  have all the car shows and stuff come through. We have a station right  there in Davenport, right on the curb. We used to go down there on  Saturday morning and watched the old cars go by, there would be all  types, Chevelle Clubs and all different types of clubs come through. The  last few years in Chandler, we   ve seen a lot of people from England.  They fly over and bring their cars over and get on 66, travel all the way  to the West Coast, then I guess get on a plane there and fly back to  England. It   s really something.  So I   m going to put you on the spot. Are you ready?  I guess so.  Tell me how you met your wife.  How I met my wife? This is my second wife, Sue. I met her in   I don   t  know what year it was. I guess    70? We   ve been married 30 years or  longer (I can   t keep up with time). She   d come to the lumber yard when  I first started seeing her, I just can   t remember how it was. But she had  two boys and of course my two boys were older, almost out of high  school when all this happened. And her two boys, the youngest one, he   s  our electrician now, does houses for us. He was kind of an ornery little  thing. He was always fun to be around.  Well tell me what your favorite spot on the farm now is?  My favorite spot is probably over on the back side, right in the middle of  the mile section up on the hill. I   ve kind of got me a place there. If I talk  Sue into it and things go just right, we might build a house over there,  but it   s so far from everything. We   d have to run a half mile of telephone  wire, a half mile electric, a half mile road, and it   s hard to do that, you  21  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  Finchum  Blakley  know, to keep it in your budget. But I always wanted to live over there.  It   s peaceful. You can see most all the farm. Can   t quite see it all, but I  can see down to the bottom here, the north half I can see. You can see  just about all of the farm from there, probably 250 acres of it. Can sit  there and watch deer run across, squirrels and whatever. We   ve got a lot  of geese here since I   ve been planting a lot of wheat and oats.  Sometimes we   ll have 300 head of geese on the fields. I guess once in a  while somebody will shoot one or two. We don   t hunt them, we just let  them eat. They eat up some of the wheat and stuff from the cows, but  they   re fun to watch.  So what do you see happening with the farm into the future?  Well hopefully we   re going to get a family trust set up and keep it in the  family name for a while then probably look towards Skip to look after  that. And then maybe when he   s gone, maybe our granddaughter that   s a  softball coach in Davenport  will look after it . Heather   s really level-headed.  I think that she would do a good job looking after it. You know  we don   t know how long she   ll be here. She may end up   with the  success she   s had here, she may end up coaching either in a big city or a  college somewhere. You know you just don   t know, but hopefully that  will keep the interest here. She has two boys that come out here a lot to  the farm and they really do enjoy it a lot, my great-grandsons. I think  seven great- and seven grandchildren, somewhere there abouts.  Do you ever have big family gatherings back at the farm?  Not very much. Skipper has his family come out here some. They bring  the kids out here a couple of times a year. They always have a  Halloween hay ride out here. He gets them on the tractor. We   ve got a  back road built all the way across the farm. And you know I can go and  go through the farm rain or shine on the gravel road and see the back  side of the farm.  Ever get lost?  Well not lately. My dad did when he got old. He kind of lost his mind  and bless his heart, he called one night and he was trying to get on the  Turnpike in Stroud. He didn   t know where he was.  It seems like a lot of land so it would have been easy to get turned  around a bit?  Well I knew the land and then clearing it, you really learn the land. I  mean, you know when we cleared this, no telling how many hundred  hours I spent out here, probably helped a little bit. I always had a dozer  22  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  operator that did the work and I   ve always had people that are real good  friends of mine that have worked out here. Bud Foster, in fact he worked  at OSU in the maintenance program up there until he came back to work  about ten years ago. He worked for me a long time and then he went up  there to get his retirement. As soon as he got it he came back and got  back to work. He built all these ponds. I think he built every one of  them. Cleaned out one and built nine. So we hope to put a sign up there  and kind of dedicate it to him because when he had cancer and he was so  bad he shouldn   t even be out here, he   d want to come out here and get  on that dozer and work.  It was therapy for him.  Yeah. Well really it was. His wife and I went to school together here in  Kendrick.  I   m sure with a farm of this size and close ties to the land, you probably  have lots of family memories, but do you have final family memories  with your father or your mother or your brother or sisters that you   d like  to share with us?  Well I have a lot. I guess some of the favorite memories I might have     of course, I always enjoyed with my dad more than anything, when I  came back here and went to work, he said,    Why don   t you come to  work with us?    Well I went to work thinking   they didn   t make a lot of  money but I thought I   d make less than he did. I didn   t know anything.  And he said,    Well, you get paid the same as I do.    That   s just the way  he was, he wanted me to get paid the same that he did, and I really  appreciated that. But I probably appreciated him more working with him  some before I bought the lumberyard out in 1964. He and I built about  15 houses, just me and him. I might tell you the first story on that. I was  working for my uncle and I   d only worked a few months with him and  we was building a school teacher there in Davenport   s house, Pauline  McCracken, and we framed it in. I was just a helper you know, handing  him boards. I didn   t know anything. And she said,    Bud, I   ve got an old  wood oak table out in the pecan grove.    It looked a lot like that right  there. And she said,    Would you look at that?    And I looked at it. This is  about what it looked like, in fact. I took it all apart and I went and  bought a belt sander. And then I bought a router to route the edges with  it, you know. And I worked on that thing probably three weeks while I  was framing that house. Everyday I   d work on it. And she   d come look,     Oh that   s so beautiful.     So one day I was there working on her house. And I don   t know if we  were sheet rocking or ready to sheet rock. I think maybe we were sheet  rocking. She came to me and she said,    I want you to trim my house and  23  build my cabinets.    And I just opened my mouth. I couldn   t do any of  that. I said,    Well I don   t know if I can do that or not, Pauline. I   ll have  to talk to my Uncle Roy,    because I really liked him, he   s a good guy.  So I go up to him and I said,    Uncle Roy, would you get mad if I told  you that Pauline wants me to build her cabinets?       Hell she does. I   ll  just go somewhere else and go to work.    He loaded his tools up and I  was on my own. That   s how I started the construction business, on that  house. Tammy   s mother lives in that house now. She died and then Jim  married Skipper   s mother-in-law and they live in that house now. It   s  out south of Davenport. Nice house, it   s still there. But that kind of gave  me my start in the construction business.  And I got real close to my dad after he developed cancer. We   d never  spent a lot of father and son time together. It was always just this  working thing, you know, and that   s just the way he was and I guess I  was, you know. We   d come out here on Mom   s birthday or when my  sisters were here, we   d have a big family get together here. She   d always  fix a big meal. Great, great cook. But when he got cancer, then I took  him   Sue   s Dad got cancer first, and we took him back and forth I think  32 times to St. Francis in Tulsa. And when Dad got it we took him 39  times back and forth. And then my uncle got it, we took him back about  the same amount. So we made over 100 trips to St. Francis hospital for  radiation treatments with all of them for cancer. I got real close to my  dad then because he started talking about some of this stuff that we  talked about now that I didn   t know about. Well you know, I always  thought I   d live to be 100 because I never was sick.  Back when they had a breakout of diseases when he was a kid, I mean  he was five or six years old, he was the only one in the family who  didn   t get it. He said,    I was the only one who didn   t get it and I had to  take care of everybody.    And he just felt like he did that all his life. He  was really good about taking care of people. When that came along, why  it hurt me. But I learned to talk to him. We talked about death   you  know he was ready for it but he was worried about my mom. She had  Alzheimer   s and he knew it before we did actually. And I didn   t realize  it so much until after he died. He said,    Now she can   t take of herself.     And I said,    We   ll take care of her Dad.    And I had a good friend of  ours who went to school with my sister who said,    Bud, do you care if I  come out and stay with Lola one night?    I said,    No, that   s fine.    She  came out here and she   d been hearing about her. She came back here the  next morning, real early the next morning   I   d just got to the lumber  yard. She said,    You   ve got to put her in a rest home.    I said,    I can   t do  that. I told Dad we   d take care of her.       You can   t take care of her.  She   s going to kill herself and burn that house down.    She   d turned the  gas stove on you know click, click, click. We   d come around and an  hour later and it would still be clicking. The propane wouldn   t come on.  24  Finchum  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  I don   t know how it kept from igniting and killing everybody. But I   m  just lucky.  So that was kind of close for me being by him. I enjoyed that. And then  when my younger sister was growing up, I put her through a lot of  trouble because I was always trying to do things. I thought about myself  instead of her. I   d make her run like a calf. I   d throw that rope and jerk  her down. Little bitty skinny thing you know. I   d jerk her back.    Oh  Bud. Bud that hurt.    You know and I   d keep bumping her on a bicycle  and she   d fall off. I asked her a little while ago if she remembered that.     Nah I just remember       going down there and we   d just got gravel put  on this road, old native gravel they dug out from the farm across the  road. Spread it on there. All that rough rock, you know about that big. I  was going like that and stuck my foot out. When I did, she fell over and  just went flying on her breast. She was about nine probably. Just peeled  her shirt off and it looked terrible. I felt so bad about that.  I about killed her three times. It was always because I was daring. I  came down this hill one time and I had 125 bales of hay we loaded up in  Kendrick on this big old wagon and a little bitty tractor. I kicked it out in  neutral on top of the hill   worst thing you could do. I got to the bottom  of that hill and I was rolling. There was   still is   a rock ledge across  there rolled up like that. I got to it and I hit my brakes and when I did, I  got that wagon kind of juggled or something. When I went over that  rock, it threw them and about half of that load of hay over. But it threw  them past the fence here, past the fence. And hay hit around just like  that. Her and a boy from Kendrick were on there and it didn   t scratch  them. I was pretty fortunate growing up. The good Lord was looking  after me I guess. Or looking after everybody.  Sounds like it.  I look back on that. I had a lot of those kinds of deals. And it was always  because I was doing something I wasn   t supposed to. Always. Running  the tractor wide open, with a load of hay, going down a hill you   re  supposed to go slow.  Now according to the Centennial Farms it   s called the Blakley Farms.  Yes, people would say,    Why don   t you call it a ranch? You   ve got all  them cows.    I said because my dad and my grandpa were great farmers.  My grandpa they said was just like a picking machine on corn. And my  dad was that way. He   d just pick corn (sound effects), throw it against  the side in the wagon. Throw it in there and it goes in there. They   d have  a team, a team wagon, you know. He   d get over there and he   d throw  into it. I   d get one row, and he   d get three. I   d be behind.    Get up here  25  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Bud.    He was always on me to get up there. I don   t know what I was  dreaming about, going to school and having fun. You know I wasn   t  dreaming about pulling corn. But those were good days. I look back on  them and think, I   m glad he worked me like that. So glad.  Did he call it anything else before you decided to     No, I don   t think so. Really never had a name for it. It never was  anything before, never was ranch or nothing. Sue and I just kind of  named it the Blakley Farms. That   s kind of what we felt it should be  because the hard work my dad did and my grandpa did is all the reason  we   ve got it or we   d never have it. Because he was the only one of the  boys   I think the only one of nine kids who had any interest in it. He  was a hard worker. A hard worker, more than probably most of us ever  meet in our lifetime. I   ve had two people who have ever worked for me  of 400-600 people that   s close to him   these two people are kind of  close to him and that   s all as far as what he could do and would do, the  amount of work and time he put into doing everything. Wasn   t a great  carpenter, he might have nails all over that thing.  We were down in Dallas, I don   t know if you   ve ever been in one  before, it   s got an old mining shaft down below. It   s all made like a mine  and that   s where the bathrooms are. We go down through this, poles are  like that, and logs. We go over there and Bob Walker   s a trim carpenter   we are going  to meet and another guy. And they were there. They were  laughing. I saw them ahead of us going back.    I wonder what they found  so funny?    They pointed up there and they just died laughing. I got  closer and he said,    Harlie framed that     and they just laughed. My  dad   s name was Harlie. And they broke in under him and they knew  how rough and crude he was, but it wouldn   t fall down. I   ve got a good  friend who lives out east of Kendrick and Dad built her house 40 years  ago or so. He worked for me, see. After I got the lumber yard, then he  went to work for me. He worked for me for 30 years. And she said,     That   s the strongest house I   ve ever seen in my life.    Everywhere I   d  go there   d be a whole crowd of people and she   d have to get up and tell  what a great deal builder he was.  So how many homes do you think you   ve built in the area in your  career?  Over 1600 we think.  Wow.  And we   ve probably remodeled I don   t know how many more. We used  to probably remodel as many as we built. And we carpeted probably  26  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  3000 or 4000. We had two big carpet crews for 25 years, in Davenport.  Marion that worked for me 44 years, went to work for me right after   I  was married to his sister before he went to work. After we got divorced,  I told him  and he said,     I knew you before ya   ll were married, I   ll  work for you if you want me to.    He was the greatest guy I ever had. He  was really good. He did everything. He thought about my interests on  everything he did. And now since he quit a couple of years ago,     Where   s Marion, where   s Marion?    Everybody asks for him because  he   d get to a job,    We   ve got to do something, Bud.    He   d jump on  Skipper   that   s Skipper   s uncle.    I don   t care. You   ve got to get        Boy he   d get on him and Skipper would get around to get him what he  needed to get it fixed. It was a lot of fun building houses.  So is Bud a family name?  That   s a nickname. I knew you   d get around to that. When I was real  small, my grandpa started calling me Bud and he called my brother  Sunny. But Earl was Sunny and I was Buddy. Buddy and Sunny. Most  people don   t even know my name. They   ll come to town and look for  Buddy Blakley and they   ll look in the book and it   s Irvin R. Blakley. A  lot of times they   ll go down to the barbeque,    Do you know Bud  Blakley? Well I looked in the book and I didn   t see it.    And they   ll say,     Well he   s Irvin Blakley.     Well is there anything else you   d like to add that I haven   t asked you  about today or Tanya hasn   t mentioned?  No, I just hope that when Sue and I are gone that my kids and grandkids  will try to keep some of the Blakley name here if they can. It might not  always be feasible to. My dad always said we   ll keep it until we have to  sell it. That   s kind of the way we feel. As long as we can afford to keep  it, we   ll try to. We   ve been trying to sell our business out and if we can  get that sold and pay off the farm then we   d be all right. But businesses  aren   t selling right now so it   s kind of been a tough year trying that. I   m  just thankful that ya   ll come down and interviewed us. We   re all very  happy about this. Most of this comes from my wife Sue and even Skip,  he   s helped a lot out here at the farm. And I appreciate both of them.  Well we appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to meet with us.  Well I   ve enjoyed doing it. I love to talk about the farm. Thirty years  ago you couldn   t have even got me to talk about it. Oh no, I   m not going  back there. That   s hard work.  Well it   s a beautiful farm. You   ve restored it very nicely and I hope your  family can enjoy it for years to come.  27  Blakley  Nykolaiszyn  Blakley  We kind of had a grand opening thing here right after we got the log  cabin done. We have our alumni banquet every year at Kendrick. We  still have 160 people and the last high school we had here was in 1962.  And from 1962 back   and Leo Blakley is the oldest alumni now. He   s  89 going on 90 years old. He graduated in 1936 up here in Kendrick and  he was a Parade Marshall last year, drove his dad   s old car, a   54  Oldsmobile. After that we announced that day after they had their little  parade that morning we were going to have an open house. And just out  of nowhere, here comes 150 people out here. Then last year we had  farmers from all over Lincoln and Payne County, they honored us   or a  couple of years ago I guess it   s been now, right after we had maybe our  100th year. And we had them out here   a real beautiful day. We had  them out here under this big old tree. Some of my friends came out and  cooked for us. Fixed really a nice meal. We had two tractors and trucks,  and we took them and went around the whole place. I may have talked  more than I should have, but I talked about how we changed the farm  from, it used to have a ditches bigger than this ditch right here, all over  that back farm. You could put ten bulldozers down there and you  couldn   t see them from the road. Now you can just shut your eyes and  wander on through there. We leveled it all up.  My cousin   s wife one time   he   d been in Korea, maybe it was just part  of the Sutton family. But he was coming out to pick up pecans one night  about 10 or 11 o   clock at night, that   s how he did things, going to go  pick up pecans. His wife was in the front seat with him and he was  driving along here and not knowing where he was going in the pasture.  He slammed into a ditch and threw her through the windshield. She liked  to have bled to death. He come down to the house and got my dad. He  didn   t want my dad to go up there.    No, I   ll take the tractor and get it  out.       I   m going to go,    Dad said. So he goes up there and there she is  just bleeding. He just threw her in the pick-up and rushed her to the  hospital. She probably would have died. Every time I think about  cleaning the place up, I think about Mary. She   s such a little thing, such  a nice lady. If I can keep that from ever happening again, I   m going to  do that. You know he shouldn   t have been out here. That was kind of an  unruly thing to do. Anyhow, he stayed with us when he was a kid. A lot  of people stayed with us as, as kids. They   d come back and stay with  Uncle Harlie and Aunt Lola and Dad would work them just like he did  us. He fed them good, and they got to go swimming at nights. They liked  that.  Well thank you very much, we appreciate it.  Well you   re welcome, I appreciate it.  -------  -------  28
