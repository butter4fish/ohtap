 Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re with  the Oklahoma State University Library, with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Today is September 12, 2012, and we   re in Loyal,  Oklahoma, Kingfisher County, interviewing Bill and Jacquelyn Pope.  Today, we   re going to talk about the Crist Centennial Farm as well as  the Pope Centennial Farm, and we   re going to start with the Crist Farm  and find out how your family, Jacquelyn, came to settle in Oklahoma.  Okay. My great-grandfather, Albert Crist, came in the Run of    92. It   s  kind of a funny story. My mother and her brother went back to Kansas  and they found   I don   t know whether he was a cousin or   I think he  was a cousin of theirs. But he said that they didn   t ever know what  happened to Nancy and Al for sure, but he was quite a gambler, and he  got his land in a horse race. (Laughs) So, we   ve always laughed, kind of,  at that a little bit, that he got his in a horse race. So, that   s how the Crists  came here. They really never lived on the farm. They built in the town of  Loyal, which my grandmother said my great-grandmother was kind of  aristocratic. She come from a better family, and so they lived in the  town. They had a two-story home, which was a big home and a fancy  home for the day and age. I don   t know   I kind of think Grandfather  was also a newspaperman. The town was Kiel, at that time. It was  named for Kiel, Germany. It   s quite a German settlement here. So, that  was how they came.  What motivated them to make the run?  Well, Grandpa was an adventurer. I mean, that   s it. See, her family,  Grandma   s family just really didn   t approve of him, from what I hear.  (Laughs) So, they came just as an adventure, and he thought he could  better himself. That   s the way they were. Like I said, my grandfather   I  was telling you a little bit ago     5  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Your great-grandfather?  No, my grandfather traded mail routes and went to Minnesota because  he thought he could better himself by going there. But they came back.  All right, Bill, tell me a little bit about the Pope Farm and how your  family came to Oklahoma.  Well, I don   t know exactly why they came to Oklahoma, except that  they were looking for land. They came out of Kansas, and they didn   t  make the Run of 1892 in here, but they did come in a few months later  and purchased three quarters. I think it was three quarters.  Your great-grandfather and your grandfather.  Yes, my great-grandfather and my grandfather and his brother. They  settled the quarters and they lived there until their deaths. My great-grandfather   s  name was Henry. He lived to be almost one hundred years  old. I never did know him, but he and his wife lived on one of the  quarters, and my grandfather lived on a quarter, and then my uncle   or  his brother   lived on another quarter. So, they had three quarters that  they secured after the Run, but just shortly after the Run. That   s about all  I could tell you about them because they wanted to be in the   they were  farmers.  German farmers, wheat land. (Laughs)  I guess they were adventurous, too. They helped establish the first  school in the area, which they were settlers that came in. The first thing   they built  was a new school.  What was the school called?  Welty. They built a school. It   s four miles west of Loyal. My  grandfather, I think, served on the first school board, there.  Probably.  But it was grades kindergarten to eighth.  First grade.  It was two miles from their house, or a mile and a half, and they walked  to school every day. There was    I don   t know how many of the kids.  There was probably four or five at that time.  6  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Kind of an interesting story, too. His mother taught in the school, and  that   s how his dad and his mother became acquainted, was through the  school. (Laughs) His mother loved to tell the stories about the early  days, like when the house burnt. They built a house there and it burnt.  His mother said there was just one thing she   d loved to have had out of  that house was the old cake plate that had a stand on it, she said, because  Mrs. Pope would fix an angel food cake every Sunday and they would  all gather round the table on Sunday. She said there was always that  angel food cake of hers on that cake plate. She said she would love to  have had that cake plate. One day, she was kicking around in the embers  and she found it. Not a crack, not a chip, and I have it today. (Laughs)  Wow. Well, on the Crist farm, the family lived in town. So, what was  happening on the farm in those early days?  I don   t know too much about the Crist Farm because it did not come to  my grandfather   s side. It went to his sister   s family. Her son had, they  said, TB  tuberculosis  of the bone. He lost a leg, and so they wanted a  place for Chubby to be able to have a home. So, the farm went to that  side of the family and to him. Then when he passed away, Bill and I  purchased it, is how we got the farm. And I said I really wanted it  because it was from my side of the family. And we happened to have the  money and we purchased it.  It   s like coming home.  Yes. (Laughs)  Well, the early years of the Pope Farm, what were some of the crops  that they were growing on the land?  Well, they had a lot of horses, of course. They had to farm with horses.  There was no machinery, mechanical tractors or anything. So, my  grandpa and his two oldest boys   well, there was three of them, I  guess   three oldest boys did the farming on the place. They farmed his  place, and then they farmed my Grandpa Henry   s place, which it was  across the road south. It was one of the three that they had settled. They  farmed kaffir corn and they raised wheat and oats. Oats was a big crop  because of the horses. A lot of their feed had to go to the horses so their  number of cattle that they had was rather limited. But they did have  cattle on wheat pastures so they had meat, plenty of meat, in the early  days.  One story I could tell you is my dad and his younger brother, just  younger than he, had two sulky plows. They were horse plows. They  were plowing one day out there on their homestead. Of course, they  7  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Finchum  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  didn   t have any shoes on. Their feet dangled under the sulky. My uncle  got his foot in the coulter, rolling coulter. Well, you know, it   s a disk  and it just cut his foot, just terribly cut it. So, they had eight horses, and  Dad took the boy, his younger brother, took him and put his foot in the  furrow, and he took and     He said he stomped it.     stomped it full of fresh dirt.  Stomped the dirt down on it     Then he had to take the horses and unhook them and take them to the  house. Then he came back after he done that with those two plows, came  back and got his brother. They took him to the doctor in Loyal.  Well, I don   t know if they even took him to the doctor or not  (Laughs)  Well, I think he did. But anyhow, his foot did heal, and he was all right.  He wasn   t lame or anything. (Laughs)  Quick thinking, too.  I had heard that story.  Bill   s dad used to tell the story about doing that.  One of the children that got to go to college went to Oklahoma A M.  He and a friend of his, they were both pretty prominent young men.  When they got over there, they were working on Old Central. They were  putting in windows so they took one of the window sills that was laying  on the ground and they brought it home with them. They got scared,  because they brought it home, and they hid that down here in Loyal. To  this day, I don   t think they   ve ever found it again. (Laughter) But those  are two of the stories that I heard about the early days in the farming.  They did haul their wheat in wagons. They threshed. They had the  threshing machines in the community that came around and threshed  each person   s place. Everybody helped everybody else. Well, they  hauled their wheat then to Hitchcock. Hitchcock is about, what, thirteen  or fourteen miles   ?  Something like that.     west of here. That   s where their grain went.  8  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  There was a railroad come through Hitchcock, and so     When the first Model T   s came out, my grandpa purchased a Model T,  he and his brother. They didn   t know how to drive it. Well, my dad had  been to mechanic school. He was about seventeen or eighteen, and he  went through the eighth grade out here at the Welty School, the one that  they   d established. Well, he got in that one Model T and his cousin got  in the other, and they drove those from Hitchcock back here to Loyal. Of  course, they was young guys. They picked up on it pretty good, but they  said that there was ruts and roads were just terribly rutty. It was a rough  trip, but they brought them home.  What about some early structures on the farm?  On the Pope Farm, there was this house. (Gestures to photograph) Then  they later on built a better house and moved this house just a little ways  and made a shed out of it.  It was used as a barn.  And they had a little shop. As far as I know, they had a     Chicken house.     barn for their horses and the chicken house. That   s about all the  buildings that I can remember. I do remember those buildings on the  place. And I remember the house. Of course, it was burned in a fire. But  after that, the buildings were torn down or just basically     Fell down. (Laughs)     done away with. We built a round top on the farm, and my dad built a  shed over there, a metal shed. Well, the round top, today, it was hit by a  storm and it just tore it all to pieces. That was not too long ago. But the  round top     You mean the shed.  The barn.  Okay.  And the shed, it was broken into, and Dad had tools and things in there  and he lost all of them. It just took all the wind out of him to think that  somebody would steal his tools, and he never did get over it.  9  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  He went into a depression.  Those buildings, basically all of them have been removed today. We   re  cleaning it up, trying to get it restored to farming. That   s kind of the way  it started. Today, we raise wheat on the place, mainly, and cattle. We  have two farms just to the north of it that we purchased that are more or  less included with this farm. We run cattle on it, now.  So, you still stay pretty busy.  Oh, yes. (Laughs) We have a set of four-wheelers a piece, and we run  cattle. (Laughter)  We   re going to jump back to the Crist Farm. Now, the Crist Farm has a  little bit of history tied in with the town of Kiel and Loyal.  Yes.  Can you tell me a little bit about that?  Well, what I understand was Grandpa gave the acreages for town, and  then they sold the lots to people. Now, what that all went for, how it was  done, exactly, I don   t know. But my understanding was also that the  plots for church were given. He gave those. Honestly, to know exactly  how, I don   t know how it did go. But they always lived in town. They  were right on Main Street. They had lumber brought in here from Dover,  from what I understand, is how they got their lumber in here for the  house. And you saw the round window in the front of the picture, there?  (Gestures) I was always told that the glass for that came from Germany.  (Laughs) So, it was supposed to be quite a house at the time it was built.  In this area, homes were not big. They were just   there was dugouts and  just anything they could throw together, which wasn   t much because we  were quite a ways either from Dover or Hitchcock where the railroads  came in to even get any lumber or anything here. And the first thing that  would go up would be a barn, not a house, as a general rule. They  weren   t fancy and water was carried. You didn   t have any plumbing or  anything. I go back over by Guthrie and I see those houses and they say  they were built with plumbing. I think,    Oh, my gosh  How long we  lived without any in this part of the state.    (Laughs) It was a different  world over here than what it was even in the eastern part of the state.  At what point did Kiel become Loyal?  It was during the First World War. They changed the name to Loyal to  10  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  prove their loyalty to the United States is what   because they no longer  wanted to be called Kiel, like Kiel, Germany when we were at war with  Germany. So, that   s the reason they changed the name to Loyal from  Kiel.  So, the Crist family, what businesses would they get involved with? What  was their occupations?  They were mail carriers and newspaper people, really. Not really  farmers. They couldn   t make it at farming, so they would branch out.  Like I said earlier, my grandfather found out there was a mail route. He  was a mail carrier around here and found out there was a mail route in  Minnesota and he thought he could do better by going there. He had a  little girl was the oldest, and he had three boys. So, they took out and  went up to Minnesota. My mother was born there in 1917, and then her  baby sister was born there two years later. There was six of them. They  were born about two years apart. Mother was, I think, six years old when  they came back to Oklahoma. It wasn   t any better and they hated the  winters. (Laughs) So, they came back, and my grandfather was a mail  carrier when he retired. He was carrying mail out of Enid at that time.  But my mother and dad and Bill   s folks, they all grew up here in this  community. Bill and I grew up here and our kids have grown up here  and are still here.  Where did your mother go to school when she was younger?  Here in Loyal. She went to Loyal. The schools had all consolidated by  the time she came back, or most of them had. So, she went to school in  Loyal. They settled out east of town, in my    I believe it was Grandpa   s  uncle   s farm. He was not able to take care of himself, so he took them in  to take care of him. That   s where they lived.  Did your mother have an occupation outside of the home?  No, not really, not my mother. She did work when she was real young  on threshing crews. She was cook on threshing crews, fifty cents a  day   or was it a week? Maybe fifty cents a week  (Laughs) But she   d  get up, she said, and make bread and bake pies and everything before the  day started.  That   s a chore in itself  (Laughter)  In just a wagon, cooking for threshing crews.  And your father was a   ?  11  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  He was a farmer.  Okay.  But the thing about my dad is he had a bad fever when I was ten years  old, lost his sight, and one thing and another. So, he didn   t do much after  that.  How many siblings do you have?  I have two sisters.  So, did you grow up in the city or on the farm?  On the farm. (Laughs)  Okay, okay.  Yes, when my Great-grandmother Maxwell, which was my dad   s  grandmother, let us live up north of town here, two miles north, it was  my dad   s Uncle Johnny   s farm, and he died with appendicitis. He didn   t  have any family, and so the farm went to my great-grandmother. So, she  let us live there, and we farmed there. Mother and I ran the tractor and it  was no automatic turning like there is now. I   d ride up on the fender  until we come to the corner, and then both of us would have to try to  turn that old Case tractor around the corner  (Laughs) But that   s how I  grew up.  Okay.  In the fields.  Okay, Bill, going back to your family, growing up on the farm   did you  grow up on the farm? Let me clarify, first.  Until I was six years old, then we moved. My mother became postmaster  in Loyal in 1939. So, we moved to Loyal, and we were there until I was  a junior, sophomore or junior in high school. And then we moved back  to the farm, just a mile and a half north of here. I lived there until I  graduated from high school, and then I left the farm and went to  Oklahoma State. I got my degree and served in the army. And then I  taught vocational agriculture for, what, ten years. I farmed a little bit on  the side, and then we came back to the farm then after that ten years.  We   ve lived either  here or  within a mile of here ever since.  So, you have this really tie, especially with the postal service in your  12  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  family   on both sides. (Laughter)  Yes. (Laughs)  Yes, quite a little bit.  Well, growing up, when you   re a little boy and still on the farm, did you  have chores you had to do?  Oh, yes. Yes, when I was little, we had about six cows or seven that  we   d milk every morning and night, and I   d help with the milking. And  then after we moved to town, we had a cow that we brought to town. I   d  go over to the pasture to milk her every night and every morning before  school and after school. We   d have milk then for our own use and sell  what we had left around town.  Now, were your grandparents still back on the farm when you moved to  town?  Your grandpa was, wasn   t he?  Yes, my grandfather lived on the farm until his later years. Then he  moved in and the children, each one of them took him for so many  months. But he was a farmer all his life. That   s all he did. He was a  member of the Anti-Horse Association here in Loyal. They had some  bandits that lived out in the hills. Gypsum Hills are just west of here. So,  they went out to get them, this posse did. When they got out there, why,  he held the horses. These boys, these robbers, came back around while  the other deputies were going in, and they said,    Frank, we know you.  We   re not going to kill you.    But they shot him in the leg and they took  off with the horses.  Scattered the horses so that they    (Laughs)  Also, I was reading about their association. They had horse thieves east  of Loyal. They said the Horse Association went out there and took the  people and run them off, told them to leave the community, and they  burned all their buildings. So, they got them out. That   s the way they got  them out of the community. They didn   t try them or anything, they just  went out there and told them to get out of there and they burned the  buildings. (Laughs) Of course, they pretty well knew who it was.  I can   t imagine living in times like that  (Laughs)  One of the stories that I have about my grandparents    My mother, her  maiden name was Gill.  13  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Your grandmother   s name.  My grandmother   s name was Gill and of course, my grandfather   s name  was Pope. Well, they had a sister, and   who all was it? There was     Popes married Gills and Gills married Popes, and they all married on the  same day.  Yes, they had a wedding on the same day. Well, one of these Gills that  married my grandmother   or not my grandmother, but my grand-aunt,  they moved down to     Yukon?  No, they were at Piedmont.  Okay.  At Piedmont, they had a boy by the name of Easton, and Easton had a  boy by the name of Stanley, and Stanley had a boy by the name of  Vince. So, does that     Vince Gill. (Laughs)  And they lived in the Piedmont area. I knew my grandmother  grand-aunt   real well. Of course, I didn   t know Vince, but I knew his dad and  his grandfather. But they all stayed here except for that family. The other  two that married stayed in the community.  The families, to this day, get together on Thanksgiving every year, any  of them that can come. A hundred and something years they   ve had their  celebration. I can   t remember what year it was they had their one  hundredth year. But they still have that family reunion on Thanksgiving  day, all of them that can come.  Going back to the farmhouse, how was it heated?  It was heated   the original house, this one that the picture   s here, I don   t  know. I supposed they were all heated with a potbelly stove, woodstove.  They had only one stove in the second house. I can remember it.  Well, they probably had a wood cook stove, though, that kept the back  warm.  Yes, we had a wood cook stove in the kitchen. But that was the way they  14  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Finchum  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  heated, was with a potbelly stove. I can remember we   d come in and  gather around that stove, and it would be red hot  But it would be cold  over in the corner, too. Everyone     One side of you would cook and the other side would freeze. (Laughter)  When you were still living on the farm as a little boy, where was your  bedroom?  In the house that I was in?  Yes.  It was in the south end of the house. It was kind of an L-shaped house,  and I slept against the wall in the south bedroom. My parents had a  bedroom just adjoining it and then the kitchen. It was a two-bedroom  house with a kitchen. We didn   t own it. We just rented it and lived there.  I lived there until I was     Six.     almost six. I started to school in    39, so it was   we lived there a little  while and then that same year we moved to Loyal. That year, why, my  mother became the postmaster at Loyal.  Would you go back and visit the farm as you were growing up through  the years?  I was on it almost every day because I would go with my dad. We had  chores and cattle to check. It was a     Fences, too.  You went out there until it rained. If it rained, you couldn   t get there.  So, you hoped for rainy days, then. (Laughter)  Yes, we did have some rain then.  She said you hoped for rainy days as a kid, so you didn   t have to go to  the farm, so you could play with all the town kids  (Laughs)  Oh, not really. I kind of enjoyed it.  When did the farm get electricity?  15  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  About    39. My dad put the electricity in. He wasn   t an electrician, but he  put the   he hung the bulbs. We had a bulb in two rooms and that was  the first electricity. Of course, rural electricity didn   t come in until about  1938 or    39 in this area, north of here. We lived seven and a half miles  north of Loyal at that time. OG E, they serviced Loyal, but the REA  serviced us in the rural areas.  When we got rural electric, yes.  Yes, it was something to have electricity because you could have an  electric iron, and you could   that   s about all we had.  Refrigerator?  Radio, we could listen   we had battery radios up until that time, but we  could listen     You   d be listening to something, but the battery would go dead. Daddy  would run the car up to the side of the house and run jumper cables in,  so you could finish your story that you was listening to. (Laughter)  Any favorite shows on the radio back then?  Well, I always like Jack Benny and the Lone Ranger.  The Green Hornet.  No, I don   t remember that. (Laughter)  You don   t remember The Green Hornet  (Laughs)  But Gene Autry, and Joe Lewis was big then. He was a champion,  heavyweight champion of the world. On Saturday, every Saturday,  you   d go to town to buy groceries. Saturday night, in the grocery store,  back in the back, they had a big potbellied stove. They had electric radio  then because they had electricity in Loyal. But we listened to Joe Lewis  fight. He   d fight, oh, maybe once a month, almost, seemed like. I  remember listening to heavyweight fights on that radio.  Can you kind of describe the town of Loyal for me? Of course, today,  I   m sure it   s a lot different than when you all were growing up.  See, I didn   t grow up in Loyal. Dad was just a sharecropper. We lived at  Hennessey for a while. We lived up on the river up here north of town  for a while, and then he moved to Hennessey, farmed over there until I  started school, and then we moved down by Kingfisher. I went to  16  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Kingfisher school for seven years before I came back to Loyal. Then  when Daddy became incapacitated, and Mother and I took over the  farming and my great-grandmother, as I said, let us farm her place, well  we moved back to Loyal at that time. I was a seventh grader in school.  He can tell you more about the town than I can, because I don   t  remember the early-day town and he kind of does. Of course, he   s older  than I am, anyhow. (Laughs)  As you come in  town  to the stoplight, the first schoolhouse was just  up   I don   t know which side of the creek it was on, but it was right  south of that stop sign. It was a big school. It was pretty good-sized for  those times. The way I understand it, it was on the south side of the  creek because they had to come across the creek to get water. There was  two or three livery stables in town. There was two blacksmith shops. I  don   t remember both blacksmith shops, but I do remember one.  Hotel, they said.  There was a hotel in town. There was two cream stations that bought  cream and eggs and sold feed. There was a dry goods store that had  closed, but the building was still there. There was a hardware, there was  three gas stations, three gas stations in town.  Drugstore.  And we had a telephone     Office.     office. We had two grocery stores. We had a post office and a  drugstore. We had two cafes. We had a barber shop, and we had our  school. Those were about the only businesses I can remember in town.  But I do remember those businesses. They used to, in April, they would  celebrate the Run of    92, and they would have a big celebration here.  There would be probably a thousand, maybe fifteen hundred people that  would gather in town and have a carnival. This place had a racetrack on  it, and they   d race out there. And they had a ball diamond on it, too, that  had ballgames, pretty intense ballgames. There was a tree right at the  east end of this place, on the fence line at the half-mile line. The Indians,  they would give them the beef and those     Tribes would come in and     Cheyenne and Arapaho, would go out there and they   d kill that beef and  hang it in that tree. And then they   d have dances in town, then. I   ve got  this place and the one east of it, and I wanted to take that fence out  17  J. Pope  B. Pope  Finchum  B. Pope  Finchum  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  between the two places. Well, they got the fence out, but the tree was  there. I had to farm around that tree so long I decided I wanted it out of  there. We took a bulldozer in there to get that tree out, and that was the  hardest   that bulldozer guy said that was the hardest tree he had ever  pulled out. (Laughs)  And the boys were so upset with Dad that he ever thought about moving  that tree out of there anyhow  Because    (Laughs)  That was kind of a landmark in the area. But I didn   t want it there so I  took it out. (Laughter)  Was there a bank in town?  Yes. Oh, I   m sorry. The bank is where the post office is now.  Just one?  Yes, there was one bank. It was the Farmers and Merchants Bank. In the  Depression, it went out. It went broke.  But it was robbed one time, too, in the early days. (Laughs) North of  here, I don   t know if it   s still there or not, but there used to be a place up  here where some of the great-grandparents lived. There was a dugout in  one of them, and that   s where  Ike  Black and  Dick  Yeager used to go  back up in there and hide. And they   d come down through some of the  land that they owned, and they knew they were there but they never told  on them. (Laughs)  Yes.  My great-grandfather that was a newspaperman was writing some stories  about them one time, so they had set up to waylay him. My grandfather  found out about it, and he changed hats and coats with him and come  out. So, when they found out it was him, they let him go on. But they  were laying in wait for my great-grandfather that was the  newspaperman. (Laughs)  Black and Yeager was the bunch that the anti-horse thieves were after  out there in the hills where my grandfather got shot. (Laughter) But they  knew him. That was the reason that they didn   t kill him.  Do you know what newspapers your grandfather worked with?  It was the Kiel   what   d they say? The Kiel Republic, wasn   t it? I can   t  remember. I   ve always been going to go hunt up some of the   I think  18  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  Okeene has, in the library up there, has some, and I need to go up there  and I never have done it yet. Bill and I talked about doing it, and we   ve  just been so busy. We always have things to do. (Laughs) It   s just like  when we hunted up the centennial farm things, we had to go to  Oklahoma City and go through the records down there to find for sure.  We thought we knew we had the centennial farms, but we had to go  down there to find the   now, his farm he knew, but mine, the Crist  Farm, to find the real lineage for sure, that it was, had stayed in the  family. And it had, so we were real tickled about that.  Bill, growing up, even though you were living in the city and you   d  spend a lot of time working on the farm, did you think you wanted to  become a farmer?  Well, yes, I would   ve like to been a farmer, but when I went to school, I  started school over at Oklahoma State as a     A M.     I wanted to be a coach and a history teacher. Well, that didn   t work  out. I decided that wasn   t right. So, I went ahead and got my degree in  vocational agriculture. Well, I went to teach agriculture, and I decided  that wasn   t what I wanted to do. So, I always was close to the farm, and  so we came back to the farm when we had a chance to rent some land  down here. We were in Kansas, and I came back and rented a quarter of  land northwest of here. I taught school at Omega. That was before the  two schools went together. The first year I coached, and then for six  more years I taught vocational agriculture.  Started a dairy.  Then we started a dairy.  We had a Grade A dairy. (Laughs)  Now, that   s a lot of work.  We had the dairy until about, what?   Nineteen  sixty-six to   1966 is when we started the dairy, and we  raised our kids on the farm, working on the dairy until   well, our son  came back in    80. He got his degree in animal science from OSU, and he  and his wife came back to the dairy. She grew up on a dairy farm down  by Ninnekah, and they wanted a dairy. They dairied until the spring and  they just   the expenses got to where it didn   t meet the pricing. And they  had pure bred. We had built pure bred. Our oldest son started his when  19  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Finchum  B. Pope  Finchum  he was nine years old, and so we went ahead and built it all pure bred.  We had Holsteins and Brown Swiss and Jerseys. In fact, the first pure  bred, I think, was probably that little Brown Swiss that Steve wrote an  essay. In the county, one of the dairy farmers in the county was giving a  Brown Swiss heifer calf, and he won that and started him on his way.  And then he bought some registered Holsteins and finally built it up.  We had a milking herd dispersal when Bill and I went out. Golly, when  was that? We decided we were going to get out. I don   t know. I went in  one day. We were feeding so many calves and one thing and another, I  said,    Something   s going to give. It   s either the cows or me     (Laughs)  But they didn   t ever turn off the milkers. Steve and Sandy went right  ahead and started milking again, and we was feeding calves up until not  too very long ago. Then this spring, they decided to go ahead and get  out. They   re still in the process of getting rid of heifers, but they   ve  gotten rid of their milking herd.  What did you coach?  I coached     Basketball.     basketball, baseball. That   s all they had here at the time.  But he taught grade school boys and girls, and junior high boys and  girls, and high school boys and girls, and taught science.  So, I   m going to back up. How did you two meet?  Our first date was a blind date. (Laughs) His cousin and I were  classmates, and she called me one day and she wanted to know if I   d go  on a blind date. Well, I knew it had to be either he or his cousin, Jay. So,  I said,    Yes, I   d go,    and it turned out to be Bill. (Laughs)  I had known her a long time.  Yes, we went to church together. But he was off at college, and so he   d  been gone to college for about four years.  What year did you graduate from Oklahoma A M?  The last class, 1956.  Before they changed the name?  20  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Finchum  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Yes. I didn   t get my degree because I didn   t graduate.  He finished in mid-term.  I had to go into the service before graduation so when I came back to get  my degree, it was Oklahoma State. So, I   ve got    Oklahoma State    on my  diploma.  Both of our boys have finished at Oklahoma State. We have a grandson  that   s got his degree in horticulture from Oklahoma State. We have two  grandkids in Oklahoma State right now. (Laughs) So, we bleed orange  around here.  So, when did you get married?   Nineteen  fifty-six. He finished in December, we were married in  February. I had graduated from high school the spring before, and he  was going into the service. And darned if I hated to see him go clear to  Georgia without me  (Laughter) Now, I think how silly that was, but     (Laughter) He would   ve waited. (Laughs)  That was a deal. We had a blizzard and we was going to get married on  Saturday. We had a blizzard and the lady that was supposed to marry  us     We had a woman preacher.     was in Texas.  And she had married and went to Texas to be with her husband and  would come on weekends, by train, to fill the pulpit. She was going to  marry us, and we had a blizzard.  So, she couldn   t do it. Well, the only other preacher that was available  was the Baptist preacher here in the community, and he hadn   t been  ordained.  No, he   d been ordained, but hadn   t     He hadn   t had his papers filed, yet.  Yes. He hadn   t filed his papers at the courthouse.  The courthouse was closed on Saturday.  On Saturday morning  (Laughs)  21  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Finchum  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  But that blizzard, this preacher agreed to go with me. We went down to  the courthouse that morning     They came and opened it up.     and they certified his papers, and then we come back. We were a little  bit late, but we got here for the wedding ceremony. (Laughs)  We were supposed to be married at two o   clock in the afternoon. Well,  Bill was a little late, but the preacher was later so it all worked out.  (Laughter)  So it   s fifty-six years?  I think it was fifty-seven, wasn   t it? Fifty-six, I guess.  Yes, that   s about right.  As you look back on the farm, has what you   ve done, what you   ve raised,  or your livestock changed over the years?  Oh, yes. The way that we farm, we farm so much more land anymore so  we have to have larger machinery. We started out with a John Deere     you   ve probably heard of the D John Deere. Well, that   s what I started  with. My dad and I, he sold his machinery. He had some machinery  when he bought some land here, and he sold it all. We didn   t have a  thing  But he had the land so he had to buy a tractor. He got an old John  Deere tractor on lugs. You know what I mean by lug drive?  Steel-wheeled.  Oh, okay.  Steel-wheeled tractor. We took it and got it under a tree and overhauled  it. We bought enough machinery. We plowed with it that year and  bought us a drill. Well, that was kind of the way I was when we started.  When I was about nine, he still had his combine and stuff, before he   d  sold out. He   d combine his own wheat and of course, I   d drive his  tractor. He had his own tractor at that time because he had a bought him  one.  It was a pull combine.  I   d pull the combine with that tractor. Well, we drove around the field  and, of course, when we went north the wind was blowing right on me. I  22  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  wasn   t very big, but we   d get around. He had to dump his wheat on the  wheat field because there weren   t any trucks in. You had to wait for  trucks to come and get it. He   d dump that wheat. I was running around  on the wheat pile, I   d go to sleep. He   d let me sleep a little bit, then he   d  holler at me, and we   d get back on the tractor and we   d go another  round. Well, that was the way we kind of started. Now, today, we don   t  plow our ground at all. We use chemicals to burn the weeds down. After  harvest, we go in and burn it down, keep the weeds controlled, and that  builds up the humus in the soil and controls the weeds. At the same time,  it causes the soil to have more moisture in it. Today, we have a little     we have hay. Not as much as we used to have because we don   t have the  dairy anymore. But we grow mostly wheat. We grow a little bit of     Milo.     milo, and we grow a little bit of canola. As we run our wheat, our  cattle, we   ve got about two hundred head of cattle. We   re trying to get  built up because he had a hold of my pasture with his diary cattle.  (Laughter) Well, he   s getting rid of his diary cattle and as he is, we   re  multiplying our beef herd. We   re going back into the beef business, but  it   s much different today. He can go over probably   used to be able to  go over about thirty-five or forty acres a day with a tractor and a little  plow. Today, he   s got a bigger tractor. It   s almost new, and he   s got a  sixty-foot sprayer boot. He can go over two to three hundred acres a day  with that sprayer. So, it makes it much more easier to farm. It   s still  difficult because you   ve got to keep water to the sprayer, and you   ve got  to keep spraying. And the wind slows you down. But we have our own  combine, and we cut our seed wheat with our combine and hire a custom  combiner to cut about eight or nine hundred acres for us.  That was the hardest thing in the world to get this old German farmer to  decide that you shouldn   t plow that up. (Laughs) The boys had to talk a  long time to get Dad to try going into no-till. But our machinery was all  worn out, and we was going to have to purchase new machinery. The  disc, the harrow, everything. So, they said,    Dad, instead of going and  buying all that, let   s try no-till.    And we found out we could get some  cost share if we go no-till, by the Conservation. So, we did decide to go  no-till and now, Dad is a firm believer  (Laughs)  Before you made the decision, did you talk to other farmers who went  no-till?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  23  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  And you got some opinions?  Yes.  I mean, who would you go t? Would you just go to people around here?  How do you find out?  I attended several of OSU   s no-till seminars     Conferences and        and I have a neighbor down south of me here that has no-tilled for  about fifteen years. I kind of listen to their advice. We were a little bit  discouraged at first, but now our production is just about as good as  anybody   s around here.  It takes about five years to get your land switched over to it.  It   s much easier and we can see where the benefit to the land in that the  soil is kind of healing itself.  Where there was holes that had been washed out, now it   s healing itself.  The residue is always there. You can see the residue. You have a little  more trouble with insects probably, but we keep them sprayed. We   ve  got our sprayer. We think it   s all right. We   re pleased with it. We have a  new drill. It   s a forty-foot, no-till drill, and we   re just going to start with  it this year. (Laughter)  It   s going to be another new experience. (Laughs)  Yes, it   s big. You can see it right out here, I think, if you want to before  you leave.  Yes, it   s pulled up here. We haven   t even learned how to use it yet, and  they   re supposed to come tomorrow.  Well, we have, too, because     Well, I mean, to calibrate it, help get it started so that     We had a smaller version of it.  Yes.  We just got a little bigger with it.  24  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Finchum  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Going no-till, does it save on your labor?  Yes, quite a bit.  Well, and it saves a lot on machinery. We don   t have so many big  tractors to take care of. The fuel bill is really something that we were  looking at, too, because we use a smaller tractor to cover the same  ground that the other farmers around here are using big tractors on.  And we only have to go over the land about two to three times before  we   re ready to plant again, whereas they   ll go over it and over it and  over it and over it, when you   re conventional, to keep the weeds down.  We try to keep good seed wheat, and we keep it clean. We try to do  some of the things that are necessary to keep us going, but     Yes. (Laughs)  So, these days, what time do you get up in the morning?  About six.  Oh, anymore, I get up about seven, somewhere between six and eight.  Yes, but I   m up at six  (Laughs) I still wake up at six o   clock. I can   t  stay in bed any longer than six o   clock and I   m up.  So, is farming very much a family affair     Oh, yes.     or do you have to hire outside help?  Just for combining, mainly, and for things like seed cleaning where we  don   t have the equipment.  Both boys are in the farm with us.  Yes.  Our oldest son is full-time farmer. Our youngest son, he has an outside  job. Right now, he   s executive secretary of Soil Conservation Districts,  but   you can see the love of the soil no matter what. (Laughs) And he   s  part-time farm.  25  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  And how many acres are y   all working?  About twenty-two hundred or twenty-three hundred acres.  Come a long way from the original claim.  Oh, yes.  160  (Laughs)  About 160 to start with.  Yes. We feel very fortunate that we   ve been able to do this. We   ve  raised three kids here. We have nine grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.  And they   re all right on the farm and farm-tied, just like  our oldest grandson. When he went over to OSU, he said,    I   m not going  to be in farm  No way     He didn   t start in the School of Agriculture. He  was going to be a scientist. But the third calculus, I think it was, or  trigonometry, one, they had pretty near ate his lunch and he went back  into the agriculture. He got his degree in horticulture. So, he   s back in  the soil no matter what. (Laughs)  Have you had an impact with the drought?  Oh, yes, it   s     We   re hauling water.  We haul water, now. Our ponds are all dry. Our wheat crop was pretty  good this year. We don   t raise corn in here, so corn or soybeans haven   t  been a problem.  Our milo doesn   t look too good. (Laughs)  Yes, the milo doesn   t look real good. Any summer crop has been a real  problem for us. The main thing, we need to just refill our ponds and  need moisture to get our seed wheat up.  We   ve got moisture, but right now, in that no-till, you   d be surprised  how much moisture    Steve, when he was getting soil samples this fall  to know what he needed to put on the land and all, he brought a  scoopful, shovelful of dirt in. He said,    I want you to just look at the  worms and stuff in this, Dad.    (Laughs) And it was quite amazing to see  how they   d   the worms in that soil. The humus is really building up in  it.  26  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Finchum  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Finchum  J. Pope  B. Pope  But you can go out here to my neighbors where they put on this liquid  gas, anhydrous ammonia, and they kill all of their insects in their soil.  Humus.  And it breaks down the humus in that. Plus, the fact that it adds salt to  the soil. I used anhydrous for a long time, and I found out that you   d be  better off if you could use more natural fertilizer and get away from it  some. But I don   t fault these farmers. They   ve farmed like this for years,  and they   ll probably go ahead and still farm like that. But I can go out  here   I was cutting hay last summer after a big rain storm, and I was  going down the road. I looked across the field and the dust was just  terrible  The ground was blowing so bad, but we weren   t blowing. We  were catching their dirt, is what we were doing. (Laughter)  Back in the day, did you have any grasshopper stories?  Oh, the grasshoppers are still bad.  We   ve had them this year real bad.  Yes, they   ve killed trees for us. We planted some plum thickets. Those  little ole plum thickets, the plants are about that high, you stick them in  the ground, they form a little leaf on the side. (Gestures) Well, they were  doing pretty good until the grasshoppers got in there.  I don   t know if they   ve killed them or if they   ll come back next spring or  what.  They just ate the leaves clear off of them.  What   d we plant, four thousand?  Yes, something like that.  What was the purpose of those?  Soil conservation, to hold the land and     Yes, it was for deer, to help the deer population, which I   m not happy  about, but we had to do that. We didn   t use to have any deer in here.  And today, you can go out here of a morning and you can count a herd  of maybe fifteen or twenty in a bunch. Well, that   s destructive to your  crops, too. They just keep multiplying and multiplying until they   re  getting to be a real problem. And then if you don   t hit one during the  wintertime, you   re lucky because you take a chance when you go out on  27  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  the road after night. And you do, too.  Yes. Oh, yes. Well, what are some other conservation efforts that you   ve  employed through the years on the farm?  Well, we   ve used terracing. We used crop rotation. We still do. There   s  a problem with rye in our wheat in both places. You can   t destroy it just  by working your soil, it   ll come back. So, what we   re doing, we   re  rotating with canola. The canola is a Roundup Ready crop. Roundup  Ready means that you can put chemicals on it, and you can kill this rye  with this Roundup Ready canola. And then in the spring after you get  your canola oil, why, the ground is pretty well free if you   re lucky and  get all your rye out of it. The canola shades the ground so it does kind of  kill the rye out. Plus, you spray it to get rid of the rye, too. And the  canola has a big tap root on it, and it breaks up the soil pan. We   ve  noticed that in the next year if you rotate it back to wheat, that your  wheat is much better so we do use this in the rotation. We   ve tried to use  soybeans, but soybeans just don   t grow in Oklahoma very good   our  part of the state. We don   t have any water to irrigate with so all of our  land is dry land. We built several ponds to help our cattle. But you can  build them and if there   s not any rain, you   re not going to have any  water anyhow. Next year, they may be overflowing.  Yes, Bill and I have put a lot of our land back to grass, too. I don   t know  if you said that. I may have missed it. (Laughs) We   ve been running  cattle, more or less, on a lot of our land we put back to grass.  With Clay with the Soil Conservation District, he pretty well tells us  what he wants us to do. (Laughter) Some of it   s good, and some of it I  don   t really follow. (Laughter) We have made changes that way.  Do you work much with your county agent?  Yes, quite a little bit. We take his advice on some things. And then on  other things, we generally go to our seed dealer or to the grain dealer  that supplies our fertilizer and seeds and so forth.  We   ve always worked with county agents, though.  Yes, we   re good friends of the county agent.  And our kids all grew up in 4-H and FFA so we   ve had close ties with  the county agent.  We respect the county agent that we have right now. The former county  agent works with the     28  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Seed company. (Laughs)     grain dealer that supplies our seed. So, he advises us on how our crops  are doing and things like that. So, we do use him quite a bit.  Are you using genetically modified seed?  Yes. We use, like I say, this canola that we use now, wheat has never  been changed that you didn   t see them, but they   re working on it. And if  they produce it and we can use it, we   re very much     You   re open to it.  Yes, we like to see it.  Going back to maybe your parents, your mother or your grandmothers,  were they involved with homemaker clubs?  Not so much. Now, my Grandmother Crist probably was. I don   t know. I  was a member of a homemaker club for a while. I got so darn busy. My  kids started really being involved in stuff. I didn   t have time for it. Our  kids showed cattle. Of course, they had purebred dairy cattle. They went  to dairy shows and Mom went along, and I cleaned the stalls and carried  out the dirty clothes. (Laughs)  Our daughter-in-law was in the home-ec   or in the     Yes, our oldest daughter-in-law was in the  homemaker club . She   s  quite a seamstress. She did a lot of work, and she   s getting back in the  swing again. She has her two grandbabies so she   s starting to get back  into it again now that they   re no longer milking. (Laughs)  Has recordkeeping changed from your father   s time to today?  It has, but he won   t do it. (Laughs)  How did you father keep records?  He kept them in a checkbook.  In a little note in his pocket.  He kept all his bills. I generally keep my bills, and I keep the income in  my checkbook today, too. So, really, there hasn   t been a lot of change.  29  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  He goes in on the computer of a morning and reads the newspaper and  sees who died. If his name   s not on it    (Laughs) But he hasn   t gone to  put his records on the computer, yet.  We do use a certified public accountant to do our taxes.  Yes.  We   ve done that for years. When I was in college, I used to do my taxes.  I didn   t have much then. (Laughter) A few years ago we got audited. I  was doing my own taxes at the time, and they came out and looked at  them. I had made a small mistake in the way that I did my depreciation. I  think it was  111 dollars difference. They said,    We wished we hadn   t  come out.    (Laughter) But I was real fortunate. Then after that I went to  someone that knew more than I did. He saved me a lot of money, too.  Last year we had an oil company come here. Chesapeake had been  leasing all of Kingfisher County, practically. So, they leased enough  land from us last year that I had quite a bit of income. Last year was the  one year that you could take 100 percent depreciation on new farm  machinery.  So, need a drill? (Laughs)  I bought this new drill. I bought a new swather. I bought a new     Baler.  Oh, yes, I bought a new baler, and I bought a new nurse tank for a  sprayer. When I came out, I didn   t owe very much taxes.  We were pretty lucky. (Laughs)  Yes.  But I don   t have any depreciation left, either. So, I don   t know  anymore     What we   re going to do this year. (Laughs)  Did either your father or your grandfather   s time see drilling on the  land.  His father, yes. They drilled on his land. He was so proud of the first  earning well, his name was Ernest, the first earning well he got. And it  did   it was a pretty good well.  30  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  We see that, especially for back then, I mean, it was tough making a  living farming that it made a difference. Could you tell that it made a  difference?  Oh, yes.  Well, it helped him, yes. And it has helped us. We haven   t have any big  wells or anything.  And we don   t own all the royalty under all our land. But what we do  own, we   ve got a little bit of oil   gas, mainly. But it   s got so that you  can   t depend on it. (Laughs) You never know from month to month what  you   re going to have.  Right. The market fluctuates and the land     Well, gas is so cheap. I can   t understand why we can   t go to compressed  natural gas, because it   s so much cheaper than gasoline. It   s just about  half the price. Of course, it costs more to buy those type of vehicles. But  they   re still talking that these big freight lines are going to take  compressed natural gas, but they can   t     Maybe that   ll be a boom for us. (Laughs)     take money to change their engines. But there   s a lot of them going to  do it, I think. In the future, Mr. Pickens says they   re going to be all  natural gas.  Our youngest son and his wife, each one have an electric and gas they  drive. The first time I drove Clay   s vehicle, scared me to death. You  know when you come up to the stop sign? The electric motor kicks in,  you think you   ve died  (Laughs)  We   ve seen farming change through the years. We   ve had the  Depression, we   ve had drought. Did you have any issues during the     80s, when it was kind of a rough time, economically?  We were dairying and     We had a cash flow because at those times     You made thirty cents a day one time, we figured up. But he wasn   t  counting the kids and my labor. So, he wasn   t making thirty cents a day.  (Laughs)  The dairy kept us going. It really did.  31  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  With the dairy, I mean, you see changes in regulation. Were you under a  lot of government regulations with the operation?  Oh, some.  Processors are making money. The producers are the one footing the  bill. If you go to the store today, you   ll see that buying milk is four  dollars a gallon. The producer gets maybe eighteen dollars on the   they  get about  2.75 a gallon. Plus, they have to pay the transportation to haul  it to the processor. Plus, they also have to pay a fee into it to help keep  these processors    regulations going and everything. So, with the cost of  feed it   s almost unbearable today to try to dairy, because there   s no one  making any money at it. Steve thought he could sell his cows, these  registered cows that are worth four or five thousand dollars apiece. You  know what he   s getting for those cows? And he   s having trouble selling  them. About fifteen hundred dollars apiece. So, he   s really taking a hurt  on those, but he wasn   t making any money with the milking. I don   t  know what   s going to happen to the dairy industry. You   re going to see  it just be big, big like the corporate cattle feeders. That   s not going to be  good, either, because they   re going to set their own prices later on. You  may see milk go to eight, ten dollars a gallon at the store.  I bought a gallon yesterday. It was over four dollars a gallon.  Yes.  I did, too. (Laughs)  Sure was.  Did your grandmother have chickens on the farm, growing up?  Oh, yes. They all did.  So, a question I like to ask   it   s something I kind of like to know   is did  they have a technique when it came to butchering the chicken?  Everybody has a different technique.  Well, I can remember how my mother did it. She would just catch a  chicken, put her foot on the head, and pull the head off. Some of them  used to wring their necks.  My mother would wring them  (Laughs)  Then you   d just put them in boiling hot water and pick the feathers off.  32  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  We usually skinned them. (Laughs) That took less time.  Yes.  My mother raised turkeys, too, and would sell turkeys, dressed turkeys,  at Thanksgiving and Christmastime. But those were picked. We had to  pick those, and she would dress them and sell dressed turkeys.  I was reading in the history of one of my great-grandparents that they  would go out of a morning. There was plentiful game. For Thanksgiving  they had a turkey they had shot. They didn   t raise it, they shot it. But  they did have chickens on the side. They had eggs, and when they came  into Oklahoma, they would milk a cow and put the cream in a bag and  put a towel on the side of the wagon. As you tripped down the road, they  had butter and buttermilk. So, that   s the way they had butter, made their  butter and buttermilk.  When they were coming to join their husbands after the Run   I know  my grandmother was six years old when they came here after the Run,  and her mother brought her and her older brothers down in the wagon  afterwards. She   s always telling the story about how when they came  across the Cimarron River it was up. Those wagon beds aren   t tied  down, you know, and it started to float off when they started to cross the  river. And then she said she could hold her hands out and feel the grass  along the side of the wagon. One thing like that, it was fun to talk to  Grandma about the things that   d happened.  On the Pope Farm, would you ever have family holiday celebrations  there?  Oh, yes. My grandfather was the oldest of the two sons that came in with  their dad. His place was generally in the center for all the family to come  in. They would come in there every Thanksgiving and every Christmas.  They celebrated Christmas, too, together. But Thanksgiving was the big  celebration because they continued it now and it still stays on. But they  had some large families, and they pretty well filled the house up when  they came in. The kids, they   d run them outside. The parents would stay  in and visit. The women would go in one room and the men in another.  They were generally religious people.  We were talking, I saw on television this morning where this one woman  is advocating letting children play unsupervised. I told Bill, I said,    Man,  we always did that.    You know, we were run out of the house,    Go play   Go play     and talk about some of the things we did. I thought,    Yes, we  did. We played.    Kids don   t know how to play anymore.  33  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  I remember one year I was about eleven and I had a cousin that was  about seven. So, we were outside over there at my grandfather   s place.  We went way out north into a creek there, and we got to looking around.  We were surveying everything and we found a nest with a coon in it   or  I mean, not a coon, but a     Badger?  No, a mink. We found a mink. We caught that mink, and we killed it.  We thought we really had something. We did. We skinned it and put it  on a frame, and I think we got fourteen dollars out of that mink.  (Laughs)  That   s pretty good money back then.  At that time, yes it was. But kids were   they were just turned loose  when they came out to the farm because there really wasn   t any place to  go, much. They got in trouble, too. (Laughter)  You wouldn   t get in trouble   No, I never was in trouble.  Bill was an only child so you know he wasn   t in trouble. (Laughter)  Would you have Christmas celebrations on the farm at all, or would you  do more in town?  We used to have them on our farm. But then when my grandparents  died, why, the families went their separate ways. We really got away  from a big family reunion. Each individual family pretty well stayed to  their own.  Our tradition, in our family, and so far we   ve had everybody here on  Christmas Eve. You can go to your in-laws    on Christmas Day, but  Christmas Eve is mine. (Laughs) And I don   t know how long I   m going  to get to do that. I   m starting to get farther and farther away. But we   re  lucky. Our children are all three here in the community. So far, we   ve  been pretty lucky to have the kids all here. We go to church on  Christmas Eve. We have Christmas candlelight services at our Methodist  church in Loyal where the kids all grew up and where we grew up. So,  we go on Christmas Eve and then come back home for finger food. I  don   t cook a big meal because we   re going to all enjoy it, even me.  (Laughs) And then that room is full of kids and wrappings and a lot of  laughter and noise.  34  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Finchum  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Where are your parents buried?  They   re buried     Across the road.     west of here.  No, your parents are right over here.  Yes, I   m sorry. My grandparents are. My parents are buried right across  the road over here. Her dad   s buried there, too.  What   s the name of that cemetery?  This one?  Yes.  Forest Home.  Is there a story behind it? Was it always there?  As long as I can remember. But, see, my Crist  great- grandparents are  out in the New Home, east of town. This one, this isn   t too old a  cemetery, I don   t think. I don   t know how it was started. Now, the one  that Bill   s grandparents are in and I have great-grandparents in, it   s over  west about   what is that, two miles?  Yes, about three miles, three and a half.  It   s two miles west and a mile back     Half north.     a half north.  And what   s the name of it?  It   s the Venerable.  Venerable.  It was on the Venerable Farm. It   s where they started it.  35  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  The story about that one is there was a family coming through here, and  the mother got sick and died, didn   t she? Or the man? And they didn   t  have any place to bury them. So, this Venerable family let them bury  them on this plot. From there, it became the cemetery. Her great-grandparents,  my great-grandparents, and my grandparents are buried  there.  I have a great-great-grandfather buried there, too, from my mother   s  mother   s side. I mean, we   our families have been here forever.  (Laughs) And my great-great-great-grandfather that   s buried over there  came in the Run. He was fifty-something years old, and his son came,  which was my great-grandfather. Yes, it   s my great-great-grandfather  and my great-grandfather were buried there. But it   s all four of our   my  grandparents, great-grandparents, and yours too Bill, came from this  area. Your mother   s people were from down in the Omega community,  but actually, right in this area is where we     We put out the flags on Memorial Day at several cemeteries around  here. They go all the way from the Korean War to the   there wasn   t any  before the Civil War   and the Spanish American War, World War I,  World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. I think there   s a Vietnam veteran  there. So, it   s kind of interesting to see     We put flags in four small cemeteries around here for the American  Legion on Memorial Day. Bill and I have enjoyed that. We   ve done that  for years, now. We   ve kind of gotten to know the cemeteries a lot better  than what we did  (Laughs)  Your family is still in the area. Y   all are still very close and tied to the  land. As you look towards the future, the next one hundred years, what  do you hope happens to the land?  Well, I always liked to see it stay in the family, but being practical, I  don   t know that it always will because our children are tied to the farm  and a few of our grandchildren, but not all of them are. Several of them,  one girl thinks she   d like to go on Broadway, which I don   t know if  she   ll do or not. One girl wanted to be a pharmacist. The boys are in     one of them is in banking, agriculture business.  Russ may come back to the farm someday.  I doubt it. (Laughter)  Right now, he   s working at TLC in the city. He lives in Edmond and like  I said, he has his degree in horticulture. He may come back. You never  know what tomorrow will bring. Who knows what tomorrow will bring.  36  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  But Bill and I are hoping that it can stay another generation, at least, in  our family. We   ve tried to get it fixed up so that the boys can continue.  They think they would like to.  And you   re still very active in the farm today.  Well, we   re not as active as we used to be, but we try to keep busy most  of the time. I take a nap after dinner, now. (Laughter)  He sits down while I clean up the kitchen, and then we go again.  (Laughs)  We work pretty good together, the boys and I. We argue once in a while.  Sometimes.  Interesting story about this picture, it   s not about the picture so much.  But this post office right here was   there was a grocery store here, and  then there was a cream station over here. (Gestures)  Later.  Yes. Then next to the cream station, over here was a beer joint and a  caf  . This ole boy that run the caf  , he had a lot of greyhound dogs,  carried them with him everywhere, and he was a big beer drinker. So,  he   d throw his beer in the back of his car or pickup or whatever he had  with those dogs. But he liked it hot so it didn   t make any difference. Her  cousin, he was my age, and he was   I didn   t have a whole lot to do with  him, did I? (Laughs)  Oh, no  (Laughter)  We   d run together all the time. (Laughs)  They both grew up in Loyal, in town. Anyhow, it was the second  cousin     Anyhow, this boy decided those dogs were making too much noise, so  he goes around behind this beer joint where the car is parked. He hokey  pokey   s these dogs, and they come out of that car or that pickup, yelping  and a yelping and a yelping. Oh, they made a terrible noise  So, this ole  boy, he said,    If I find out who did that, I   m going to shoot the SOB      (Laughter) Well, he got his gun out and he found out that it was her  cousin Blackie, and he ran him into this feed store, or where the feed  was right next door to him. He got him back there in a corner, and that  boy just was scared to death, pleading for his life. He never did shoot  37  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  him, but boy, he threatened to shoot him  (Laughter) I can remember  that just as plain.  It   s a wonder you wasn   t in with him. (Laughs)  No, I didn   t hokey pokey the dogs that day. But anyhow, I happened to  be   I was lucky I was on the outside here, somewhere. (Laughs)  Do you think Loyal could hang on?  There   ll be a village and homes. But there was a caf   in town that was  run for years by a family. I don   t know, Corlitha sold it a few years ago  and nobody else could make a go of it.  There isn   t a business on Main Street anymore.  Just a post office, and it   s only three hours a day.  Of course, we have our school, and I think our school is     Our school is growing like crazy and I don   t really know why.  We have a big grain elevator. Plus, we have a filling station at the south  end of town that does pretty good business. But that   s all that   s left.  Well, he has a grill. Mike has a grill in the filling station, and that   s  about the only thing there is in town anymore.  You can   t tell. Chesapeake, of course, is in a bad way, but they   ve got  all the leases around in here. If they should come back in here and drill,  horizontal drill   you know, most of these wells are vertical now   if  they horizontal drill in here, they could make a big impact on this  community.  I guess you just never know what tomorrow will bring.  You never know, but stranger things have happened.  That   s right. Well, business has picked up for the station down here  since they started this pipeline, too.  But Loyal, there was rumors of a railroad going through here. In fact,  you can still see some of the grade. So, some of the men in the area had  put up grade and everything for them, and then they bypassed us and  went through Hitchcock. So, that   s when Loyal started to dwindle at that  time and never did recover from that.  38  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Well, you had some time out of Oklahoma, but you came back to Loyal.  Why would you come back to Loyal?  It   s home.  Well, it   s my home. (Laughter) I   ve been in Kansas and     He was teaching and the school had an opening, and we had where we  could rent a quarter of land, come back to the farm, and he could drive to  teach. That   s when we came back.  But we   ve been through a blizzard in western Kansas. (Laughter)  Several of them. We   ve been down in Georgia     The heat in Georgia, during the summer. (Laughs)  And there   s so much Kudzu down there, I don   t think I could live down  there. This is about   even though it   s dry, I probably wouldn   t move out  of Oklahoma.  We   re Plains people and our family was all here. That was another thing,  both our families were here. So, we just came back and raised our kids  here, and our kids are here. So, hopefully     Well, our great-grandparents went through a lot just to establish a place  for future generations to live. I feel that we need to keep that tradition  going if we can, especially if we   re comfortable with it. And we are.  I would not want to go through what my great-grandmothers went  through.  It was a tough time.  I don   t know how they did it. I honestly don   t know how they did it. It  seemed to me like it would be so much worse for a woman than it was  for a man. Maybe it wouldn   t be, but trying to raise babies with no  help   have babies.  No electricity, indoor plumbing     You had a pump.  Yes.  I   ve run that pump handle and    (Laughs)  39  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  B. Pope  J. Pope  And I don   t know how much blowing dirt they had in this area, then.  Oh, when they had the Dust Bowl, it was awful. I was born in    37, so     but Mom would tell about   she said that it was so hot and all, they   d  hang wet dish towels and sheets up on the windows to try to keep the  dirt off of the babies and out of the house.  There   s a documentary of the Dust Bowl going. It   ll be shown when?  It   s real soon, yes.  Clay has charge of that.  Well, he   s been helping, working with it.  He   s been working with it. He   s really enthused about it. He uses that as  a talking point with a lot of these farmers around here.  Trying to get them to go no-till and one thing, use conservation  practices. (Laughs)  But Stillwater   s the only place to go to school. (Laughter) When you  bleed orange and you   re a Cowboy fan all the way around, I guess that  makes you pretty close to the soil and to the school.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to add that we haven   t spoken  about today, anything else you   d like to tell us about your family or your  farm life here?  I wouldn   t trade it. It was a good place to raise my kids. My grandkids,  most of them have been raised on the farm. I have a couple in the city  from   but they   re home a lot of the time on the farm, too, so I wouldn   t  change it. Although, I   m always telling him I married a teacher and he  brought me back to the farm. (Laughter)  In 1990, we were the Oklahoma Farm Family of the Year. Farm Bureau  names a farm family every year.  That was quite a thrill. (Laughs) Bill   s been on the Regents at Redlands,  and so I just feel like we   ve been pretty blessed with some of the things  we have got to do and some of the things that we   ve been able to  accomplish, mainly the kids. They   re all three pretty successful. Our  oldest son is a successful farmer, and our daughter is postmaster and has  got her kids pretty well raised. Bryce, he   s twelve, yet, but the other two  are in college. And our youngest son has two older kids and then two  40  Nykolaiszyn  J. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  Nykolaiszyn  B. Pope  J. Pope  little ones that he   s blessed with. They   re just doing pretty good. They   re  doing pretty good. Pretty good kids.  You   ve done a good job, and you   re still doing good stuff with the land.  Well, we hope it   s better when we leave it than it was when we got it.  Any final words, Bill? (Laughter)  Well, I hope that Mike Gundy gets that Cowboy team turned around.  (Laughter)  It   s early  It   s early  (Laughter) Well, we really appreciate your time  today, and thank you for giving us a little bit of background about the  town of Loyal and your families here, and the work you   re doing on your  farm. We really appreciate it.  Oh, we were happy to do it.  Hope we helped you with your project.  -------  -------
