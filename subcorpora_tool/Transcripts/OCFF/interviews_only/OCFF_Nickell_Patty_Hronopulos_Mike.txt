 Nykolaiszyn and with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re  with Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library.  Today is September 6, 2012, and we   re in Enid, Oklahoma, interviewing  Patty Nickell and Mike Hronopulos. They   re with the William H. Fox  Farm, which is in Kingfisher County. Thank you for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Patty, I want to start with you. I want you to tell me a little bit about  your family and how they came to Oklahoma.  Okay. My mother   s family made the Run into Oklahoma in 1889, and  my grandmother was born in Honeywell, Kansas. And her father was a  doctor and a pharmacist and he taught school. That   s where my  grandfather met her. He was herding cattle and also hunting buffalos. He  went into the pharmacy and saw my grandmother and was madly in love  with this red-headed girl, because she was only about sixteen at the time.  He said,    Boy, I   m going to keep an eye on her over the years.    Which I  think they got married when she was about twenty, and her parents  didn   t approve at all, because they were kind of well-educated. They  thought he was kind of a half-Cherokee cowboy, which he was. But they  lived all their life together and they lived on the farm until    41. Then  they bought a house in Marshall, Oklahoma.  How did they come to select that particular piece of land in the Run?  Because he hunted buffalo all in this area and also scouted the army. He  knew where all the land was, and he knew he wanted a farm that had a  river on it. And their farm has Skeleton Creek on it. So, when he made  the Run he knew exactly where to go. It   s says in some of the things I   ve  5  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  given you that my grandmother, she watched all the people that were  going in to get land, watched the horses while they made the Run and  guarded  them , made sure no one took them. After they all got their  land, she had some bacon fat, lard, but she called it lard, and took her  fishing pole out and caught enough fish in the creek to feed all those  people. (Laughs) She fried fish. My two uncles and my aunt were all  born in the dugout, which they lived in for quite a while. My mother was  the first one actually born with a doctor there. They lived in the dugout,  and then I think after five years they had to start building a house. So,  they built a little log cabin and then they added around it. It got bigger  and bigger and bigger, and it was kind of a nice little farmhouse. But it   s  not there anymore, except for the original log cabin.  So, in those early years, what were some of the crops that they were  growing?  Mainly wheat. And across the river, they had a fruit orchard. They had  apple trees, peach, all kinds of peaches and pears and plum trees. But I  don   t think they ever farmed anything but wheat. Mike went by this year  and he said it looked like they had a good crop of wheat this year. This  man that lives in Marshall, Jim Yoakum, he   s the one that rents the land.  My mother rented to the same man for years, and I still rent it for what  she rented it for like forty years ago. (Laughter) Mike says,    Mom, don   t  you think you ought to raise that?    I just read that someone just rented a  farm for six thousand dollars, and he pays three thousand. So, I probably  do need to up it. But he doesn   t live there. He lives in Marshall. In the  winter, he hauls   what   s it called?  Propane.  Propane. But he likes it. I   d rather have someone there that I know is  dependable, because sometimes those people rent it and it   s not good.  Well, do you have any memories of your grandmother?  Oh my gosh, yes  Well, in fact, the last ten years of her life she lived  here in Enid with my mother. We loved going to the farm as little kids.  She had a big garden, and we liked to go down to the creek and wade in  the creek. My brother liked to fish. Yes, it was fun.  You mentioned the dugout and then how they built the log cabin and  built on to it. What are some of the other early structures that you know  of that were on the farm?  Well, look in that picture. (Gestures) Let   s see. They had a barn, and  they had a granary, and they had a cellar. Oh, and you can see in the  6  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  picture they had an outhouse, which I hated. (Laughter) With Sears and  Roebuck catalogue paper. (Laughter)  Chicken coop, it looks like. They always had chickens around.  Oh, yes. She raised chickens. She   d say,    Patty, go gather the chickens.     I wouldn   t even want to do that. She   d just reach under them. Here she   d  have eggs, eggs, eggs. Every time we   d go she   d have fried chicken.  Well, when she knew we were coming, she went out with her   she had  a deal like she undid a hanger. She   d grab that chicken by the leg and  then she   d just wring its neck, put it in hot water, put it in hot water. Oh,  I thought it was awful  She thought nothing about it. (Laughter) It was  just something she did every day. (Laughs) And she made biscuits every  day, all her life until she moved into Marshall and she got a toaster.  Never made biscuits again. (Laughter) Every morning, my grandfather  would say,    Are the biscuits ready, Cora?     (Laughter) Every morning.  And sometimes he   d be down there and we   d be trying to sleep   we  were little kids. He   d say,    Are the girls up yet?     (Yells) (Laughter)  Now we are  (Laughter)  She   d say,    Billy  You   re going to wake them up,    as if anyone would     Oh, funny, funny.  Well, when you would visit the farm as a little girl, where would you  sleep?  Where did we sleep?  Yes.  Well, they had an upstairs that my uncle lived in, and then they had a  room that was like   I don   t know what you called it, but it   s where they  had a pot-bellied stove and kept the heat. And then a kitchen and a  screened in back porch by the kitchen, which my grandmother was  always out there churning butter. I thought that butter was terrible. I  wouldn   t eat it. (Laughter) And I wouldn   t drink the milk. It wasn   t  pasteurized. I didn   t know    But she was a good cook, good fried  chicken. And they had what they called a parlor, but it had horsehair  furniture. Do you know what that   s like? Oh, it   s terrible, rough. But she  didn   t really want anyone to sit down on it. But that   s where we slept  because it made into a bed. I did not like that part of it, and I didn   t like  the outhouse part at all. (Laughter) And then my grandmother had a nice  bedroom. It wasn   t very big, but it was big enough for them. She always  had a huge garden, grew everything. And she had my complexion so she  always wore a hat with a big brim, and covered her   just all covered up.  7  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  I don   t care how hot it was, she didn   t want any sun on her. She was a  pretty good   you know, those people just knew how to get by. The way  he cut the wheat was he had a horse that pulled this kind of whatever,  tractor   well, it wasn   t a tractor. I don   t know.  A plow? (Laughs)  A plow, yes.  Did your grandparents have jobs outside of the farm?  No.  So, that   s how they made their living?  Yes.  Do you have any idea of the closest place they would take their goods to  market?  Marshall.  Marshall.  And you know, they had a big oil boom in Roxanna. What   s that town  just out here where all the oil wells used to be? Covington. Huge oil in  there. Until last year, that farm was still producing quite a bit of oil, all  those years since back in the    20s. But they called me from the oil  company one day last winter and said,    We   re just dismantling the oil  well. Do you want to come down and see that we do it?    At my age I  just don   t drive out of town or anything. But I told them to call the man  that rents it, Jim Yoakum. So, he went to make sure that they put  everything back like it should be and all that. But no, I don   t think my  grandmother ever had a  job . I think she worked in her dad   s pharmacy  in Honeywell, probably, helped, but actually job, job, I don   t think so.  So, the oil on the farm was more supplemental-type income?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay. Do you recall a time when they had it versus they didn   t have the  mineral rights?  When I   d go down there, I don   t even remember seeing the oil wells. So,  8  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  I don   t know when they actually started     I only ask because we sometimes find that it made a dramatic difference  in just getting by and it   s a little easier to breathe.  What about going to  church?   Yes, they belonged to the Christian church and never missed. My  grandmother taught Sunday school for fifty years in Marshall at the  Christian church. My grandfather had a Model-A with a rumble seat, and  I could remember one time he said,    You girls      my sister was four  years younger      You girls going to go to Marshall with me? I   m going  to go get some groceries.    We said,    Sure.    So, we were in the rumble  seat, he backed out and just tore someone   s license plate off   just roar   (Imitates engine) (Laughter) I grab the door, I   d say,    Goose it, Billy   Goose it     (Laughter) Marilyn and I, we   d just die laughing. It was so  funny. But we used   my sister and I used to take the train. My mother  would take us here, to the Frisco, and we   d take the train to Marshall.  Then we   d walk to my grandparents    house. We thought that was a big  adventure.  So, you were riding the rails pretty early.  Yes. I know one time   well, I didn   t tell my mother about it right away,  but I told her a little later. My little sister was four years younger, and  one time that guy on the train pulled up her skirt. I said,    Mother, I  don   t       She said,    I   m never letting you go down there again on that  train by yourself     (Laughs)  Your mother, did she attend country schools?  Yes, except she was a privileged one. She was the youngest so she got to  go to Guthrie on the train.  Wow.  For junior high. And she went to college in Tahlequah, East Central.  Northeastern, wasn   t it?  Yes. It   s beautiful over there. She loved it over there. But she was the  youngest and things were a little better for her than the others.  How many siblings did she have?  My mother?  9  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Finchum  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Yes.  Three. But my brother got killed in a car accident when he was twenty-five.  But she had two brothers and a sister.  Oh, my mother had two brothers and a sister. She was the baby. Her  sister always lived in New Mexico. She married a big cattle rancher in  Clayton, New Mexico. We used to go visit them, too. That was fun.  When you would have holidays growing up, would you have them at the  farm? Like Christmas?  No, I don   t really ever remember going there for Christmas. I think they  came here. And I know they always came for the Cherokee Strip Parade.  They always rode in the car as the oldest couple in the parade. They  loved that.  That   s a big deal   Oh, it was to them, yes  Convertible, yes  And I know you   ve heard of  Pistol Pete.  Yes.  He was one of their very best friends.  Really? Frank Eaton was?  Yes, he was a character. (Laughter)  Well, with Marshall, they probably knew Angie Debo as well?  Oh, yes. They   re mentioned in several of her books.  Oh, Angie Debo was     Yes, she was a neighbor, basically.  She taught at Marshall School. She told her students, she said,    All right,  I want to hear some really good written stories. You go over and see  Grandma Fox, and she   ll tell you all kinds of stories.    And sure enough,  they did. They   d come over and she   d tell them about when they came  and took her father to the   oh, they had all kinds of good stories to tell.  But my grandmother really came from a long line of really good   Elder  10  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell   William  Brewster was her great-great-grandfather that came over on  that Mayflower. So, she has a pretty   really, they were all very well  educated and intelligent.  I   m not sure if you read this about Cora Fox, her grandmother, but  there   s a paragraph in here that says,    The Foxes lived in a dugout for  several years but later built a small cabin on their northeastern  Kingfisher County claim near the village of Sheridan. They lived there  until 1942 then moved to nearby Marshall in Logan County. There, they  lived across the street from a school where Angie Debo, later prominent  Oklahoma historian, taught history. Ms. Debo told her students that each  time they came to class with a different original story from Cora Fox  about the early days, she would give them an A. (Laughter) Cora made  sure that each student who showed up got a different story, later  remarking,    History was a breeze for them that year.       (Laughter) So,  yes, she knew the Debos very well. In several of her books, she  mentioned her.  Oh, yes.  Billy and Cora Fox.  Well, they kept the farm in Kingfisher, but what motivated them to move  to Marshall?  Their age and not being able to     Work the farm?  So, he needed to just rent it. Actually, my aunt bought that house for  them in Marshall. It was a nice little   nice, safe town, four hundred  people.  Was it hard to make that transition, do you think?  Oh, I don   t know. I don   t think so, not for my grandmother because she  had a refrigerator, and she could have ice cream and a toaster.  (Laughter) She thought it was grand. And she didn   t have to make  biscuits anymore. (Laughter)  When they moved to Marshall, the people who rented the farm, were  they family?  No.  No. Mr. Rudy, oh, I know. And he rented it for years and years and  11  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  years.  None of your uncles did anything on the farm.  No.  So, your family, they weren   t interested in farming?  Well, my Uncle Leo farmed, but he ended up living way down in  southern Oklahoma and had a farm down there. You went down there  one time. What   s that state farm?  It wasn   t Wynnewood, was it?  Wilburton.  Wilburton, that   s it.  Yes, way down there. And my Aunt Lola, she ended up in New Mexico  on  200,000 dollar acre ranches. Poor thing. (Laughs) With ten jillion  cattle.  Did your mom aspire to live the farm life?  No. No. Well, I mean, it was okay, but she was a city girl. She liked it.  She lived in Tulsa for a while, taught school. She taught school in  Billings. That was her first job. Then she started teaching in Enid. She  taught at Roosevelt School. It   s not even here. I mean, the city, they  don   t have it as a grade school, but she taught there and that   s where she  met my dad. He always grew up in Enid. And we lived in South  America for four years when I was   from when I was   I was four years  old when we moved here. We moved back here because my brother, she  wanted him to start school in Oklahoma. But we lived in Chile, and my  mother and dad loved that. She spoke pretty darn good Spanish. She just  learned from     Were they teaching school down there?  No, no. My dad was a nitrate engineer.  Oh, okay.  He was working for the Guggenheim   s big business. But then during the  Depression, they came back to Oklahoma and stayed. My mother lived  here until she was 103. She died in 2003. She was walking the day she  died, didn   t have a walker, never took a medication of any kind. If her  12  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Finchum  Hronopulos  Nickell  head hurt and I tried to get her to take an aspirin,    Oh  I don   t want any  of that drug stuff     (Laughter) I said,    Mother     Or she   d have a bad  cold,    Mom          No  No      Well, she wouldn   t take any over-the-counter drugs, but would she have  any home remedies?  Vaseline, or what   s that stuff you rub on your chest   Bengay. That was  her thing. (Laughter) Rub it on your chest. (Laughs) But she was     wasn   t she, Mike? Healthy.  Yes.  She walked all over this town.  In her nineties she would walk just miles and miles.  I remember one time my niece called me and said,    Patty, Aunt Patty.    I  said,    What?    She said,    I just saw your mother.    I said,    Where   d you  see her?       Oh, she was around O and K, trying to cross over to go      she  thought she was going to Central National Bank. That   s where her  money was. But it was at Eighth and she didn   t anymore understand why  she couldn   t go in and write a check. She was in her nineties then.  Through the years, can you talk about how the farm has changed, if it   s  changed, with what   s growing on the farm?  Anything that was there, to my memory, was the wheat and the fruit.  She personally had a huge garden and canned everything. They had a  cellar where they kept it. When they would cut wheat, they would have  farmhands and she fed those guys. I mean, you can imagine how many  hungry guys and all the food they ate. So, they had to have help getting  it in. They didn   t have these tractors like they do now. They just a horse  pulling a plow.  Had threshing crews?  Yes.  And another thing that I remember her doing   and she always had to  take me with her to it and I always thought it was boring   a quilting  bee. All these women sitting at the   nothing but quilting.    Oh, you   ll  have fun, Patty     Well    But that   s what they did to keep busy and it  was social for them, seeing all their lady friends and doing something  worthwhile, I guess. (Laughs)  13  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Finchum  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  When you would visit the farm as a little girl, would you have chores?  No.  No.  No, because I wouldn   t touch a hen   s nest. I didn   t want any part of that.  (Laughter) And I remember my brother, he just loved going to the barn  and watching them milk cows. And they always had a bunch of cats.  They   d squirt   cats sitting there drinking milk, drinking milk. One time  I said,    Well, I want to learn how to do that.    Not a good idea at all.  (Laughs) I couldn   t get anything, but I wouldn   t drink that milk anyway.  I didn   t like   I wasn   t used to   it was not cold. There, she made her  butter, and I didn   t like that either. (Laughs)  Was your grandfather involved in the farming community?  They were.  They both were?  They were very social in anything that had to do with pioneers.  Oh, okay.  In fact, it says in there somewhere she was president of the   and my  grandfather was, too. And all those people they knew, they all got  together a lot and talked about the old, old days.  Did they attend church very often?  Oh, they would not miss. I mean, they   d have to be really sick. They  took that little Model T to Marshall every Sunday. She taught Sunday  school, too, for fifty years. They were very     Well, and your grandmother had a couple of brothers that were real well-known,  the Brewster Brothers.  Oh, yes. Her     So, they had family that     He was the secretary of the   oh, the   he was up in the pioneer     Yes, that   s another couple of really interesting biographies about Cora  Fox   s brothers.  14  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  Oscar.  Oscar Brewster and what was the other one   s name?  One of them went to Wyoming. I didn   t ever know him.  Here   s a picture of them. (Gestures)  But they belonged to something called a Cow Puncher Society, and they  had all these   they were real social people.  Well, you mentioned something interesting happened to a part of the old  farmhouse. So, could you tell me about that?  Well, I think it   s been about   how long has it been since they took that  farmhouse down?  Oh, gosh. What, twenty years, probably?  But they just kept adding on and building on. And then it ended up  being   it was a nice little farmhouse. I didn   t like the horsehair furniture  much, but    (Laughs)  Actually, it says    In 1994 Marvin Bules of Pond Creek, Oklahoma  purchased it from the Fox family, dismantled it log by log, reassembled  it at his private museum collection at Pond Creek.     Did someone approach the family and say,    Hey, I have this idea.     Yes, Bob Klemme.  And,    I think this would be good to do.     Yes.  And what were you thinking, like,    You want to do what?      Yes.  Yes, he called. I put the sign at the farm and when they were taking the  other stuff around, he said,    Those logs were perfect,    because they   d  been covered around, and then he said,    I think we ought to preserve  that. What do you think?    I said,    Well, I think that   s a great idea.    So,  they did. Have you ever seen it, Mike?  15  Hronopulos  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Not since they rebuilt it, no.  So how big is it, what they reassembled?  Oh, small.  Well, it says a fourteen-by-sixteen foot cabin.  Wow.  But it fills the front of that museum. It   s a pretty good size, pretty nice.  Well, that   s a good family legacy to have.  Yes.  And when you think coming from a dugout and finally, we actually have  a wood-burning stove. They never, to my knowledge   and I   m sure they  don   t or they never did have electricity. They had those gas lanterns,  which was good for light, and that one stove, wood-burning stove.  And you guys probably did a little research into the 101 Ranch, I guess?  Oh, they were huge into that   Her Uncle Brewster, it says,    Spent most of his years as a range cook for  George W. Miller, founder of the 101 Ranch.    That was your  grandmother   s brother, see.  Yes. Yes, those people were active, socially. Gosh, I remember that  Roxanna is where they first had the big oil. That town hadn   t been there  in years, but that was a boom to those farmers.  You   ve kept the farm in your family for so long. Why has it been  important to keep the farm this whole time?  I have no idea. (Laughs) Well, because they all like to go look at it.  (Laughter) And my mother owned two-thirds because her sister gave her  her interest because she took care of my grandmother when she got old.  So, she had two-thirds and then the other third belonged   you know, all  those people originally had it are gone, and they   re just way down the  line. Great-great   people I don   t even know. But I   ve just had people,     You want to sell it?    And I know my sister didn   t ever want to. And her  daughters, one of them, Mary Katherine lives in Norman and works for  the university, OU. The other one lives in New Mexico. But they   ve  never wanted to sell. I mean, it   s the only thing they own. Their parents  16  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  have been gone quite a while. The one in New Mexico never comes that  she doesn   t go by the farm so it personally means something to them.  Now, I haven   t been down there in years, but I don   t really have any  desire to sell it. And then my kids could do what they want to when I   m  not around.  Mike, when you were growing up, would you go to the farm and spend  any time on it?  A little bit. When I was old enough to remember, we would go to  Marshall. They moved into the town of Marshall, and it was a few miles  from the actual farm. So, we would go out to the farm, occasionally.  He wasn   t even born when they were still     Well, I knew my great-grandmother. But I just thought it was  interesting. I was looking in here and your grandfather, I guess, died on  your birthday.  On the what?  On your birthday.  Oh, yes.  Right before I was born. He died in 1951, on October 28th, which was  her birthday.  Yes.  I was born in    52, so I never actually got to meet him. But I knew my  great-grandmother quite well because she lived with her  Patty   s   mother. I do remember going to the farm, but at that time nobody  actually lived there. But we would go out and go down to the creek, and  that was pretty neat, as a kid, just to see what it was like. I try to go by  there and look at it occasionally on the way from here back to Norman  because it   s right off Highway 51. It   s real easy to get to, so I enjoy just  going out to see it every once in a while.  Is it something special to you to still have that land in your family?  Yes, yes, because they were some of the     And I think it means a lot to some of my nieces because their parents are  both gone, and they know they own something here.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Well, it kind of leads up to the question we ask all of our farm families is  looking at the next one hundred years   I know it   s hard to predict   but  what do you hope happens to your centennial farm? What do you hope  will happen?  I hope people are still allowed to be able to own property like that. We  need farmers to keep doing the food. I think it   s really important.  I   d like to see it stay in the family if possible. It   s just nice to know your  heritage goes back that far and you have something there to actually  look at, touch, and feel. Just knowing that you had one of the original  claims from the Run in    89 is just kind of a neat thing.  I think it   s the fact they   re pioneers, they lived exceptionally tough times  but in a way, exciting. They did a good job.  They   ve come a long way from that dugout.  Yes.  Boy, you aren   t kidding. And the same on the other side of the family,  the ones that came in on the train, gosh, they did well, really well. I just  wish my aunt had not sold that land like she did, waited until they started  that overpass. He knew what was coming. She   d sell it like  250 bucks.  As we wind down, are there any stories about that farm that just really  stick out in your mind that we may have missed? Anything, any special     The farm here?  Yes, any special memories?  The circus.  Oh  Tell us about the circus.  Well, they came right up Frisco, railroad trucks within half a mile of the  farm. You got to see them march all those elephants and all those tigers.  It was exciting as a little kid. We got free tickets to the circus, naturally.  But yes, I thought that was fun, very fun.  That was probably the first time you   d ever seen an elephant in person.  Well, sure  (Laughter) Yes, they didn   t have zoos back then, much.  Would you ever notice hobos or gypsies with the train right there?  18  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Nickell  Hronopulos  Nykolaiszyn  Nickell  Nykolaiszyn  Hronopulos  Times were kind of tough, but I remember one time a man came to  Mother, knocked on the door, and asked if she had any food he could  have.
