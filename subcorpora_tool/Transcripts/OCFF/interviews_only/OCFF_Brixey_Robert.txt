 Finchum  Brixey  This is August the 25th 2008. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project called Oklahoma Centennial Farms. And we   re here in  Payne with Robert Brixey on the Brixey Farm. And Juliana Nykolaiszyn  is also here so she may chime in with a question too. Thank you for  having us today.  Thank you for coming.  Okay, let   s start by having you tell how your family came to have this  piece of land.  This piece of land was purchased by my great-grandfather right after the  run of 1889. He wasn   t in the run, but right after the run he came here  from Seymour   now a town named Brixey, Missouri, which was named  after a great-great grandfather who was a general for the Union Army in  the Civil War. Anyway, they came to Oklahoma after they opened up  Indian Territory. And he bought this quarter section with a team of  horses and then he sold the property to my grandfather. Well, my great-grandfather   s  name was Barney Robert Brixey. And then my  grandfather   s name was Aaron Robert Brixey, who bought the farm.  And then my father, Harvey Robert Brixey, bought it from his dad. And  then I inherited it   the farm, from my father. And that   s the history of  our farm.  And do you have a first name before your Robert?  My name is Robert Leonard.  Well I wondered     And then my son is Robert Dwight and his son   s name is Justin Robert.  5  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  You   ve got a lot of Robert   s.  Yes, we   ve got a lot of Robert   s.  So your great grandfather, when he moved here did any of his siblings  come?  My great grandfather, to my knowledge, no. I think he was the only  Brixey that came. Most stayed in Missouri and Tennessee.  And how many children did he have?  Barney Brixey had eight children.  And the other seven didn   t choose to stay on the farm then?  One did and two others stayed in the Perkins area.  One did.  Aaron Robert, he stayed on the farm  And how many children did he have?  He had eight. That would have been my grandfather. And he had eight   Florence, Glen, Harvey, Barney, Ruth, Ora Jane, Bud, and Bonna  Faye . Four boys and four girls. And all eight of them were raised here  on the farm. Two of them were born in Utah. There was a period of  time where he moved to Utah. And two of them were born up there. But  all the others were born right here on the farm.  And the other seven just didn   t want to live on it for their entire life  then?  Well it came time that my grandparents were going to retire and they  offered the farm to any of their children that wanted to buy it. At that  time my father was the only one that was living in the area that was  active in the farming industry. So he chose to buy it.  And then it comes to you. Then how many brothers and sisters do you  have?  I have two sisters.  Two sisters. Are they in the area?  6  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  One of them is a graduate of OSU and she is now a professor at the  Laureate University in Los Angeles, or based out of Los Angeles. And  the other one is deceased. In fact this is her house right here. And she  lived here for about ten years. She stayed in Oklahoma. Rosetta Mackey  was her name.  Any other of the children go to OSU?  My dad   s brother Bud went to OSU for two years before he was drafted  into the Army  and several of Bud   s children went to OSU . Then there  were two other brothers that went into the Army during that period.  That was during the war that they were all maturing. And there was just  that one brother. Then several of my cousins have gone to OSU. To my  knowledge, Marilyn  Wells , my sister, is the only one who graduated.  She received her doctorate degree from OSU.  In the very beginning what did the farm, farm? Or what was the  produce? Cattle? Or wheat? Or what?  The very beginning it was cattle. They had all the domestic farm  animals; chickens, sheep, ducks, horses. And then they raised the hay for  them. They had a lot of prairie hay, meadows, back on the east side.  They would raise hay. Cotton was very popular in the very beginning.  And wheat, and then once Dad got it, the farm had been pretty much  been depleted of the nutrients in the soil. He put it in the soil  conservation program to rebuild the soil. It was a government program.  And pretty much it has been that way. I haven   t really actively farmed it.  I   ve raised cattle on the farm but as far as raising wheat and stuff like  that we really haven   t. I   ve kept it involved with the soil conservation  program.  And is there anything special about the farm you want to talk about  first? Any uniqueness to it?  Oh, uniqueness. I   ll take you down later and show you the original log  cabin. When you homesteaded a property you had to build a house on it  that was 12x12, being made out of logs or sod or wood, anything but  you had to live there for five years before the home became yours or  before the property became yours. My great-grandfather built that log  cabin. Well, as the families grew, his family and then my grandfather   s  family, they added on two rooms to it and it became a four room log  cabin or a four room house. And then I didn   t know   I was always told  there was a log cabin in the center. Then once I got the house, the rooms  were falling in and I was having problems getting insurance on the farm  and so I took the rooms off and was able to get the insurance. But there  stood that old log cabin. And it still stands there today as well as the  7  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  original barn and the smokehouse and the old water well is down there.  And then when my father got the farm, there was a big ravine down  here. I called it a gulley, but anyway, it   s a ravine today. He dammed it  up, and because of all the grass out here, and there was no run off on the  red soil, the water is clear. And immediately   now this was done back  in the late    50   s and immediately the kids, my sister had all of her  friends, and I had all my friends. We immediately started coming out  here swimming because it was a clear swimming hole. It became known  as Brixey Lake. And oh, he kept it open. He would charge people to  come in and swim. He kept it open until he died in 1988. At that time we  closed it. If you go back to people in that era they all know where  Brixey Lake is.  Have you been swimming in it lately?  Yesterday.  Maybe we   ll get to see it too.  Yes.  So the original farmhouse where you grew up     I didn   t grow up in it. My grandparents didn   t retire until the late    50   s  so they stayed on the farm. And then we had already established a home  over on the southeast side of Perkins. We stayed there all the time. Then  later my parents moved onto a farm on the south edge of Perkins. And  then I moved to the farm around 1990 and stayed here until I moved to  Texas a couple years ago, on an investment down there.  So as a child you   d come and do holidays with grandparents?  Oh, yes.  Christmas and     And all of my childhood days out here.  Favorite place in that house was probably the     Well, the living room. The living room consisted of a wood burning  stove, some old rocking chairs, a piano and a bed.  Who played the piano?  8  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  I didn   t, but we would sit around the old wood stove in the winter time.  And of course there was no electricity or running water.  When did that come? Do you remember?  They made the house modern as far as electricity in the   probably  around mid 50   s. It never had running water. They always carried the  water. Nor did it have an indoor bathroom.  So is the privy still standing?  No.  No?  No, it   s gone. But the house, it was four rooms. In the original log cabin  there was the living room and then they built on a kitchen which it had a  wood stove in it and that   s how they cooked. And then opposite of the  kitchen, on the other side of the house, was Grandma and Grandpa   s  bedroom. All four girls lived in the   stayed in the living room. That  was their bedroom also. Then the four boys, there was the one room  upstairs. And that   s the way they lived.  Eight under   now days that would be really crowded. Wouldn   t it?  It sure would. But you kept warm.  Were there times when the farm didn   t produce enough to make ends  meet?  According to my aunt and uncle, there were some pretty rough times  back during the Depression. Their only source of income was the cream  and they would have to milk the cows. They had a hand separator, they  called them, that would separate the milk from the cream. And they  would sell the cream once a week and they would also sell the eggs once  a week and that   s how they bought their staples. Of course they didn   t  have very much money. There wasn   t any money. And what clothes they  had, from my aunt and uncle, they would just pass them down from one  generation. I mean when they outgrew them they just went to the next  child.  They were probably very fortunate because they did have my  grandfather   s sister who lived exactly about a mile and a half straight  east of here. I remember my father used to talk about how they would  walk across the country to Aunt Ora   s and Uncle Harvey   s place and  they didn   t have any children. So they would go over there and would  9  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  work for fifty cents a day. So I   m sure that fifty cents went to help  support the family. And then I remember one of dad   s brother, Uncle  Glen, he told me that the only way they could get spending money was,  of course, to work for Uncle Harvey or to go out and trap wild animals  for their fur. The fur industry was really big back then. That would have  been back in the 20   s and 30   s during the Depression. And that was their  way of getting spending money.  I remember my aunt Ora Jane wrote in her paper that if extra money was  needed, well, my grandfather would just rob piggy banks from the kids  and come up with whatever money was needed. They didn   t even have a  car back then. My aunt, Ora Jane, she wrote that they would take a  horse and wagon to go visit their grandparents. I guess it probably  wasn   t until the 30   s or the late 20   s that they actually got a Model T car  to drive.  How close was school for them?  They actually went to Perkins. The school bus did come out here. They  would have to walk up to the corner and catch the school bus. But the  school bus did come out here to pick them up. Now my mother, she was  raised a couple of miles over west and she went to IXL school which  was over on   which is now on Highway 33. Which they just recently  moved into the new Territorial Plaza there in Perkins.  That   s where that building went.  Yes, it   s over there.  Well, I wondered.  They even looked at the log cabin. David Sasser was thinking about  moving it to the Territorial Plaza. But being that it   s a two story log  cabin, I don   t think it would have held up to the move. They chose to put  a little one story log cabin over there.  So once your father got it, he mainly did cattle?  He did cattle. He kept it in the soil conservation program. He just  mainly ran cattle on it. And then there   s several meadows where he  would cut the prairie hay once a year.  Did they have their own garden where they could be self sustaining that  way?  Oh yes, my grandparents always had a beautiful garden. My aunt, Ora  10  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Jane, she said that they always had to   the girls, that was their job to  work the garden and to put up the vegetables. And they had fruit trees.  Did they quilt?  Oh yes, there were quilting clubs.  Any of those still left in the family?  Oh, yes. In fact, a couple of years ago I took   there were a lot of quilt  tops that were never made into quilts and I took them and made all of  my grandchildren quilts for Christmas.  So you   re favorite meals would have been fried chicken or   ?  Well, probably not a favorite meal, that would have been a luxury meal.  I know even when I was raised very rarely did we have fried chicken.  And if we had fried chicken that was really a luxury meal because those  chickens were used for the eggs. We were raised on   if we had meat it  was usually a squirrel or a rabbit or something like that. I remember we  had potato soup almost every day.  And your vegetables?  Uh-huh.  Did they have family pets?  Dogs and cats. And I know my uncle Bud, he said that they had a pet  raccoon and one time it got mad because they gave it   a raccoon will  always wash its food and he put in his note that they gave it some dried  gravy. And when he put the gravy in water it melted and the raccoon  got mad because he couldn   t find his food. And the raccoon would also  steal anything that was shiny.  Then my uncle Bud said during holidays and birthdays they   d always  make homemade gifts, you know, nothing that you would go and buy.  And the neighbors would come. At Thanksgiving they would always  have a harvest wreath made with corn. And at Christmas they would cut  a cedar tree from the farm and decorate it with homemade decoration,  chains of color paper strips, real apples, and odd shape nuts.  Did any of them get involved in 4-H or FFA?  Very much so. All of them that I mentioned. Yes.  11  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Nykolaiszyn  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Any county extension workers where they came in with the soil  conservation?  They didn   t mention. They didn   t recall any of the county extension  people coming out. They were involved in FFA and 4H.  So the land is originally 160 acres?  Uh-huh.  Do you still have all 160?  Actually, my sister took this one acre. My father gave us all an acre,  which I never took. But my sister took this acre. And then my younger  sister took an acre over on the other side of the farm which she has since  sold. But other than that, it   s all intact.  Did they expand any? Getting more than that over the years? 160     My father did. My grandfather, he didn   t, but my father did. He  purchased   oh he probably had a total of about five quarter sections of  land here in the community.  What   s your favorite farm memory from your youth? Do you have that  one memory?  Oh, here on this farm my favorite thing to do was I   d go down into the  ravine where the spring was and make mud pies. The mud was real     real thick. And we   d go down there and play. It was always real cool  because of the old spring down there and everything was wet and damp.  If they didn   t have running water, how would you clean up after that?  Well, you   d jump into the   I   ll show you. They had the spring dammed  up and you would jump in the water and clean up.  Did they have a cellar?  Yes. It was just an old dirt cellar.  With can goods and such?  Uh-huh.  When you mentioned a smokehouse, did they smoke ham?  12  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  I   m sure they did. They probably smoked ham and beef to preserve it for  those winter months.  Was there a porch on the farmhouse?  I don   t recall ever seeing a porch. My aunt and uncle didn   t write  anything about a porch. In fact one of them said there wasn   t a porch.  However, one of my other aunts said that she remembered a porch being  there. So I don   t know.  Different people remember different things. How about fences? How  was the property marked?  By fence. By the fences. They would make their own fence post usually  out of cedar or bodark wood, which would   had a long life span. And  that   s the way they would mark the boundaries.  Would it be split rail?  Pardon?  Would it be split rail fences back in the old days?  Yup.  You know sometimes when you travel you   ll see the pile of rocks on the  corners to mark boundaries. I don   t know if they did that here.  Now my uncle Glen, he used to talk about over on the east side of the  property he remembered, as a kid, a trail where wagons would go  through. There was a trail that went through the farm before  everything   before the run and everything started being fenced off. I  thought that was interesting. There was also a spring over there so  probably people would stop and water their horses over there at the  spring. In fact it   s right in   I haven   t looked it up on the map. But it   d  be right in the area where   well Washington Irving, the poet, he came  through this area. I know there used to be a monument over here by IXL  School on Highway 33. So I bet he went on the trail that came through  this property.  Good history. Probably have found a few arrowheads too, over the  years?  You know, I   ve never found one over here. I   ve never found an  arrowhead. I have on the other farm on the southeast part of Perkins. But  never here.  13  Finchum  Brixey  Nykolaiszyn  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  I figured with the water source you might have.  I remember some of my aunts and uncles having them. I never did find  any.  Was the farm run just by the family? Or did you employ any outside help  through the year?  Oh no, there was never any outside help. Now my father once   once  me and my sisters grew up, well then he did. But up until that time it  was all self sufficient with the kids, with my aunts and uncles.  Did they have to have supplemental income themselves? Did they take  jobs off the farm?  Well my uncle Bud, he mentioned that my grandfather would do  veterinarian type work which is probably how my father learned to do it.  My dad had all the equipment to   what we call cutting horses, to  castrate a horse. Then I remember as a child myself going with Dad and  we would go around to all the people in the neighborhood that needed a  horse cut. And I would help him throw those horses and do that type of  work. Course you couldn   t charge for it, they   d just give him a  donation. I   m sure my dad learned that from my grandfather. And I   m  sure that   s probably where he got the equipment to do that.  You   d kind of help each other along the way too, with different farmers  in the neighborhood. Those that could do certain things, to fill in.  So my grandfather, that would have been one other source that he would  make a little bit of money. And they were also very active in the church.  Lost Creek Church is a mile north and they were very active in that.  That was probably their biggest social activity, with the church life.  Stillwater would be the closest town or Perkins?  Perkins.  Perkins.  Perkins would be your closest town. Even me as a kid, when I was a kid  going to Stillwater would be a once a month trip. You would have  everything in Perkins, movie theater, dry goods store, you know, there  was several of those. It was all right there in Perkins. Maybe once a  month we would go to Stillwater or go to Cushing.  Cushing is a little farther.  14  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Mm-hmm.  Did your grandmother have a favorite recipe? Was she real good at  baking pies or homemade bread or anything in particular?  Oh, I remember Grandma   she would always make a lot. She   d make  her own breads. And, you know, I remember having a lot of breads. I  remember having a lot of bad peanut butter, because it would come in a  box, a paper box. It would always taste old. She always had lots of  bread and lots of food. Of course, she always had lots of vegetables.  Seemed like everything she cooked, all I can remember, was always  creamed. Creamed peas, creamed corns, and creamed potatoes. All that  kind of stuff.  Well if you didn   t have chicken, did you get to have fried eggs very  often? Or were those for money making too?  Oh no, we would have lots of eggs.  And the chores were divided between the girls and the boys?  They were. I noticed the girls were involved, did a lot with milking the  cows. The heavy work was done by the guys. You know, my uncles,  they farmed with horses. They would have to do the farm work, you  know, building fence and cutting trees and stuff like that. It was  interesting to know that the girls were very much involved in the  milking of the cows, and separating the milk and the cream, that kind of  stuff and all of the cleanup.  And it was known as a farm as opposed to a ranch or a homestead or     you just called it the Brixey Farm?  It   s called the Brixey Farm. Now I call it the Brixey Homestead. But it  was just always known as the Brixey Farm.  And once they got electricity do you remember having a refrigerator or  was there something major like that you recall?  I remember there was   it seems like there was an old refrigerator that  was electric.  Before that would it have been an icebox?  Before that it would have been an icebox. When I was growing up, we  we did have a refrigerator that was natural gas. And we didn   t have  electricity or we didn   t have running water. The only thing we had was  15  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  natural gas out there where we were raised. So it was real common for  me to visit my grandparents without the modern conveniences. Well, my  mother was raised by her grandfather, who would be my great-grandfather,  and I used to go stay with him. In fact I was the only  grandchild that would go stay with him because all the other  grandchildren they were   I guess the reason they wouldn   t stay with  him was they had the modern conveniences and didn   t want to stay out  there because there   s no electricity, no indoor bathroom, no running  water and that was just normal for me. But I   d always make sure I  didn   t stay there on Saturday nights cause Grandma   that was the night  that she would take a bath and you would be scrubbed down with lye  soap. And if you   ve ever had a bath with lye soap, you   ll never have  another one because it burns. I know my aunt and uncle they both  groaned about how on Saturday nights they would both take a bath in the  kitchen in a galvanized tin tub and all eight of them used the same bath  water.  Did they get to pick which order they got to go in?  I don   t know. I wondered that too.  Volunteer to go first and get it over with and be clean? So Sundays were  special then if they cleaned up on Saturday nights?  Oh yeah. You always had to clean up on Saturday nights for Sundays.  Go to Sunday school and church and then you have your big meal on  Sunday.  And then what after your big meal? Did you get to play?  Visit with family and relatives. Play.  Was there a tire swing?  Oh yeah. We had swings and we had teeter totters, and stuff like that.  And bicycles?  Bicycles, yeah. There were bicycles. Lots of marbles. We played  marbles a lot. In fact when I was cleaning up down there I found marbles  under the house and stuff like that.  Where would your closest friends be? If it was 160 acres here, you   d  have to go quite a ways to even have friends over?  Well, back then, you would have a farmhouse on each quarter section  16  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  and Hershell Cross was mentioned in my uncle   s notes that he lived on  the next quarter south, so they could go to his house or they could go  over to the Cundiff   s, which they had lots of children. So on every  quarter section there would be a farmhouse with a family. You really  weren   t that far from friends. Now, today it   s not feasible or possible to  make a living off a quarter section of land. So these people have sold off  their farm and lots of people living out here now, they live out here in  the country but they are working in town. But you go over south, over  to where I was raised five miles out of Perkins on the southeast part of  town there   s not a lot of people or development going on. There   s very  few people, I mean you may be two or three miles from the nearest  neighbor because if you   re going to be a farmer, you   ve got to have lots  of land. It   s impossible to make a living on a quarter section of land. In  fact my great-grandfather who lived a couple miles over, Ed Jackson is  his name, he only had 80 acres and he raised the same amount of  children on 80 acres plus adopting my mother and my aunt, Mercedes  Barta. But it   s amazing how they did raise people and how little it took  to get by.  A lot of relatives close by, it sounds like.  Oh yeah.  They   re all around.  Yeah. There   s a lot of them. It   s funny to come up here because still  today, you know I   ve got cousins every place. You just drive around the  corner, and you   ll find cousins.  What do you envision happening the next hundred years for this section  of land?  I don   t have any plans for it. I don   t have any plans to sell it. You never  can tell. Stillwater is really growing along as well as Perkins and  someone may come along with an offer that I can   t refuse to take. I  don   t need to sell it. You know no hardship there. I would love to see it  passed it on to my son and then ultimately to my grandson and keep it in  the family.  Do they have any inclination to...?  Robert, my son, he really enjoys the farm. He enjoys it. He has a good  job, and he enjoys coming up here and going swimming.  Well it may not be income producing but maybe a place to retreat to?  17  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Nykolaiszyn  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Yeah right. I can see them having a retreat up here. I don   t see them  moving up here but who knows. Maybe when they retire they   ll move up  here. He also has land over by Perkins. My parents left land to all of  their grandkids when they died. So he has some land up here.  Do they have a storm shelter? Or did they worry about tornadoes back  then?  You know, I   ve never been in one, my whole life. Living right here in  Oklahoma, I have never been into a storm shelter when a storm came.  Mom always said well, if it   s time to go, it   s time to go. We did have a  cellar. And I guess if we saw a tornado coming, we   d go and get into it.  But in all my days up here, I   ve never been in a cellar for a storm.  You mentioned earlier in the interview the work you did with the log  cabin. Have you done any other restoration work on the farm since  you   ve been in possession of it?  Well the smokehouse was just leaning, and we stood it back up as much  as we could to secure it. But other than just maintaining, you know, the  grass and stuff, not a lot.  So how early did you learn how to hunt?  Well I wasn   t a hunter. Now my father was. I didn   t get into that. I  would go with him, but I just never did enjoy going out and killing  animals. I don   t know why, but I just didn   t do that. But my father and  his brothers, they were all big hunters.  Did you have BB guns early?  Oh yeah. We had BB guns. In fact my uncle Bud mentioned that he got  his BB gun taken away by my grandmother, because he was aiming  between the crack of the wood in the smokehouse and hit it. But not  knowing that his sister, Bonna Fay, was inside and she got hit in the rear.  So Grandma took his BB gun away from him. He was the youngest of  all of the children.  So what are the other names?  Well, the girls are Bonna Fay and Ruth and Florence and Ora Jane. And  Ora Jane is the only one that is living today, of the girls. And all of them  graduated. They all went to school in Perkins and most of them did  graduate. In fact Ora Jane did mention that she was valedictorian of her  class at Perkins. And she was a very interesting lady. She went on to  nursing school and became a missionary and served two terms of, I think  18  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  they were five years each, in Ethiopia. And then she, due to some health  problems from the water in Africa, had to stop going over to do her  mission work. Then she did a lot of midwife work across the United  States. Now she resides over in Harrah, Oklahoma. And then there were  the four brothers Barney and Glen and Bud and my father, Harvey. Of  which Barney and Bud are still alive today.  They   d be in their 80   s? 90   s?  Oh yeah. They   d be in their 80   s or near 80   s. And my father died at a  young age. He died in    88 at the age of 67. I thought to me that was  very young.  So are the brothers in the area?  Well Bud is up in Hooker, Oklahoma. He moved to Hooker and farmed  all of his life up there. And then Barney and Glen moved to Salt Lake  City after World War II and married and raised a family in Salt Lake  City, Utah.  Your parents spent some time in Utah as well?  No my parents didn   t. No. I don   t know if he was born before they went  to Utah or afterwards but he was born in the house I   m going to show  you later.  From Oklahoma to Utah, what was the pull to Utah?  I think it was kind of like a land run up there where you could  homestead some property, which my grandfather did. And that land was  later bought by some of my other uncles. It   s called Summit Point and  they go up there every summer. In fact, Bud went up there this summer  and I don   t know who joined him. But they go up there and stay. My  grandparents only stayed up there a couple of years and two of their  children were born there. And then they came back to Oklahoma. I  guess it was maybe just too cold or too hard to make a living up there.  Or maybe to be closer to Brixey Farm and their hometown.  Maybe so.  Is there anything I haven   t asked that you want to talk about? Any family  lore? Any favorite family stories that have been passed down from  generation to generation?  Oh, golly.  19  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Any fish that got away stories? That kind of thing?  Family stories? That   s a hard one.  That   s a hard one, it is. Home remedies?  Oh, that   s a good one. My aunt, she was a missionary and a nurse. She  said that a home remedy was, I can   t believe it, for a sore throat take  kerosene and honey.  Kerosene?  Kerosene and honey. Now I   ve heard of whiskey and honey. But that   s  the first time I   ve ever heard of kerosene and honey. I know my  grandparents would never have allowed whiskey in the house so maybe  it works. And soda, you   d make a soda mixture probably out of baking  soda and water for poison ivy. And iodine for cuts. And castor oil for  stomachache. I remember even as a kid my sister and I, we wouldn   t  dare tell Mom and Dad we had a stomachache because we knew we  were going to get a full tablespoon of castor oil. Have you ever had that?  I have, it   s awful. (Laughter) Well I   ve had whiskey and honey too. It   s  not too good either when you   re little.  Yeah, I know. My great-grandparents used to give me that, my other  grandparents. Kerosene, I mean, I can   t imagine.  I can   t either. I wonder what percentage. Just a little bit of kerosene  and a lot of honey. I bet it would burn.  I don   t know. You know, I can see whiskey and honey because having  taken it as a kid, it would make you sleep.  Sure.  And the honey would probably be soothing for the sore throat. I  remember my father used to   when we had a sore throat, he would swab  our throats with iodine. They never went to the doctor, however, they  did say with my grandmother she did go to the doctor with double  pneumonia. She went to the hospital with it. Fortunately it didn   t kill her  or anything.  I wonder how they pulled teeth in those days for kids, you know, baby  teeth. Any tricks to those?  Oh, my dad he used to just get a pair of pliers and pull them out, you  20  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  know, with our baby teeth.  Well, I think we   ve covered a lot.  I know my grandmother here, she was a Hall. And it   s interesting to go  to the cemetery. There were three sisters that all died within the same  week and they were very young. I couldn   t find out why from any of my  aunts and uncles. Later reading the news, they died in 1918 and that   s  when they had   what do you call it pandemic? Where you have a lot  of   Epidemic?  Mm-hmm.  Of flu. And there was like hundreds of thousands of people that died  during that period from the flu.  And those three sisters did?  My grandmother lost three sisters during that period to that.  Is there a family plot, since you mentioned a cemetery, where they   re all  buried?  There is. Yes. And it   s really interesting. You go over there and I have  my great-grandfather and my grandfather and my grandmother and her  parents and they   re all buried over in Elm Grove. And then on my  mother   s side, she lost her mother when she was only like five or six  years old and she   s buried over there. My great-grandparents and they   re  all buried over at Elm Grove Cemetery.  In Perkins?  Elm Grove is a couple miles west of Lost Creek Church.  Okay, we may have to venture there on our way back.  And then my parents, they would have been buried there however they  bought the place right there on the south edge of city limits in Perkins.  And that was originally homesteaded by, oh I can   t think of his name. I  should know it. But he was the one who developed the town of Perkins.  And then he had that quarter section that he homesteaded. He took one  acre out of his farm that was right across from Perkins Cemetery and if  you couldn   t afford to buy a lot, then you could be buried there free. I  mean as far as   you didn   t have to buy a lot. Before my dad died, he  made it known that he wanted to be buried on his farm. So that   s where  they are buried, on his farm.  21  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  And you   re allowed to do that?  Well, they are now. In fact I remember when Dad bought the farm, that  cemetery wasn   t kept up because it was just private land and people  although they were buried there, nobody kept it up. It was just all brush  and briars and every now and then you   d see a headstone. Knight was  the man   s name that originally owned that farm and developed Perkins.  But then Perkins took in that cemetery and cleaned it all up. And it   s just  a little tiny cemetery right across the road from the main cemetery in  Perkins.  We   ll have to go to that too.  Yes, it   s really neat. Nobody   s been buried there since Perkins took that  in. They probably did that 20 years ago. Everybody likes to be buried, I  guess, over with the people with money on the other side. Just my  relatives have been buried there, an uncle and a cousin, and my sister,  and my parents.  Let   s go back a little bit. How did your parents meet? Were they in high  school together?  High school, yes. In school.  They didn   t venture too far from their home places?  They stayed right here all their lives. When they got married they, of  course there wasn   t any money. They got married back in I   d say 1941,  just getting over the Depression. They lived in my great-grandfather   s  chicken house. It was either a chicken house or a smokehouse or a  combination. They just cleaned it out and that   s where they started.  Then they continued their farming operations and then we got an oil  well. And that oil well made all the difference in the world. Just that one  little oil well. And then Dad just continued to buy land and property.  First tractor?  He had lots of tractors. He had big tractors. I would spend my summers  in the late    50   s going to the wheat harvest. After our harvest here in  Oklahoma we would load up the combine on the truck and we head  north. We would custom combine wheat all the way up to   we would  end in Nebraska and by that time it would be in the first of August and  we would head back to Oklahoma, get ready for school. And we did that  about three years in a row.  Prior to that, when I was a very young kid, two or three years of age they  22  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  would   when they first came out with the first self propelled combine     in fact it was featured in the Perkins Journal just a couple of weeks ago.  They wrote up an article that Grover Rains in Perkins, my cousin, and  my folk   s cousin, Grover and Dad took the first self-propelled combine  and went to wheat harvest. And they did a couple years in a row.  And that paid pretty well?  It was good money. Yeah.  I   m just curious.  It was good money.  And did you have round hay bales or square hay bales?  Well in those days, back then you had the square and you   d put it up in  barn. And today, you put them in round bales because you don   t have to  put them up in the barn. But I hauled lots of hay in my days. A lot of  hay. Something I never want to do again. And I shoveled a lot of  wheat.  Shovel it? To a truck or something?  You shovel it off a truck into a barn, into the bins to hold the wheat, to  storage.  Is that building still here on the farm too? Where you store the wheat?  We would put a little bit of wheat in what was the old smokehouse. And  it would hold enough wheat just for   and I remember Grandpa doing  the same. He would store it. He would keep back a little wheat for his  seed wheat for the coming year. I was reading my Aunt Ora Jane   s  notes and she said that for breakfast they would have the home grown  wheat. And I don   t know what they did with that. They soaked wheat in  water and we would eat it. I guess it was like cracked wheat. She said  that   s what they ate for breakfast every day.  Early cereal, I guess. I wonder what they did for sugar.  They would buy their sugar. That would be one of staples that they  would buy.  At the local mercantile? Well you   d think you   d make a whole lot of  bread, if you had your own wheat?  23  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Mm-hmm. Oh, I remember when just to get store bought bread. That  was great, learning to dislike homemade bread. To love that store  bought bread, and store bought milk.  And ice cream?  We would make ice cream. That was always a family deal. You   d take  turns churning the ice cream, used fresh milk. That was always a fun  Sunday afternoon deal.  In the wintertime, anything special about how you handled the cold, cold  weather here?  I remember the winters being very cold. Course our house, there was no  insulation. When we were tearing down this old house, the insulation  they used was cotton seed hulls in between the walls to insulate the  home. In our home that we were raised in, there was no insulation. Our  only source of heat was the fireplace. And my sisters and I, we would  go to bed. We would take bricks and these old heavy irons and we   d put  them in the fireplace and get them red hot and then we   d wrap them in  towels and we   d go upstairs and sleep in the same bed and, you know,  cuddle up to those hot bricks and hot irons just to keep warm. I  remember it always being very cold. And all my grandparents, that was  their only source of heat. We didn   t have a pot belly stove. We just had  that old fire place. But my grandparents always had that pot belly stove  to keep warm by.  Cut your own trees and   ?  Oh yeah, cut your own trees. Prior to winter you   d saw up a big pile of  wood and you   d burn that all winter.  Roasted marshmallows?  Oh, yeah we   d do that too. And then we   d have to get up every  morning, and I don   t know how many cows I use to have to milk, three  or four cows every morning before you   d go to school.  Before the sun came up?  Yeah, before the sun came up. We   d milk all those cows then go in and  clean up and eat breakfast and then catch the bus and ride the bus  forever to get to school. And this morning I took one of the guy   s  grandkids to school and thought,    Man, this is a lot of work to have to  get up early just to take somebody to school.    Now thinking back on it, I  don   t know what time I got up. And then you   d come home from school  24  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  and you   d have to go do the same thing over again. Milk the cows and  slop the pigs.  How many cows did you have then if you milked four?  Oh, I don   t remember. We would probably milk about 15 cows a day,  morning and night. Because my sister, she would have to milk and Dad  he would milk. We   d probably milk anywhere from 12 to 15 head.  So when was the last time you milked one?  The last time I milked one I was probably about 12 years old. About the  time the oil well came. I think we got to quit milking cows.  Didn   t have to do it through high school then?  No I didn   t. Not through high school.  Were you in 4-H yourself, in high school?  I was very active in FFA. And we were involved in 4-H you know  during grade school years. We would always have stuff we would enter  in the county fair in Stillwater. And I noticed my notes from my aunt  and uncle that they said they did the same things as kids. They   d enter  their stuff in the county fair and that was always good money, too.  If you won?  Yeah, if you won.  By stuff to you mean cattle or animals or other types of 4-H stuff?  Oh, we   d put cattle in, your corn, your watermelons, you know. Mom  would bake stuff and pies and cakes. You   d put in any of your can  goods that you canned. We would put everything we could put our hands  on hoping to win a ribbon and get some money.  Would you go and stay for the entire thing? Or would you come back  and forth at night?  We   d come back and forth. And then if you won, you   d take it to the  state fair. We never got to state fair though.  County fairs are good too, they   re fun. And the carnival came through,  some? Traveling carnivals?  25  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  We had carnivals for the county fair. And I can remember we used to  have circuses that would come to Stillwater. We never had a carnival in  Perkins, but I remember when I was a kid, they would have a circus that  would come to Stillwater.  Where would it be?  They had it out there in a big pasture. Out there by   on the other side  of, you know where the Harley Davidson is?  Mm-hmm.  On the opposite side of the road. Out there, there was a big pasture and  that   s where they would have it.  Including rides like Ferris wheels and things?  Not at the circus.  Oh the circus, I   m thinking carnivals.  At the carnivals they did. Carnivals were always lots of fun. I mean, we  always enjoyed going to that. And my great-grandfather, it was a big  deal to watch the horse pull. We   d always have to go to the horse pull  because they   d have these big horses that would pull weights.  Let   s go back a little bit. You mentioned that your family got an oil well?  Yes.  Let   s talk a little bit about that. How did that come about?  Well, that would have been in 1956.  Oh, a long time ago.  Uh-huh. That they drilled the first oil well. I remember that it was really  exciting. Dad said that we got oil so we could have anything we wanted.  Us kids, he told my sister and I that we could have anything we wanted,  and at that time I wanted a racer bike. By that time I was too fat and  heavy that I blew the tires out on it. But I got my racer bike and my  sister got a record player. But that changed our lives because there was  suddenly money coming in. It wasn   t much because the oil wasn   t much  then. And then they drilled another well and they got oil on it. Today  that second well is still pumping. And you know, we still get a little  check.  26  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  And what prompted them to even start drilling?  They leased the land to the oil company, an oil company wanted to lease  the land, the mineral rights. And so I think they leased it for a couple of  years and they either have to drill or give it up after a few years. And  they drilled and got it. At that time they had drilled several wells in that  area near the farm.  Someone knocked and said can we?  Yeah. So it really helped us out. I remember we got a new car in 1956.  We got a    56 ford. Took a vacation and went all the way up to the state  of Washington and back. We were gone for 15 days on the road all the  time with as many relatives that we had, we only had to spend one night  in a hotel for the whole duration of the trip.  That   s pretty good.  Yeah.  Can   t do that these days. Did you name the well?  No. Couldn   t. Now my aunt and uncle, the Barta   s, drilled a well right,  they lived right south of town, my mother   s sister. They drilled their  own well right in their front yard. And I   ll be darned if they didn   t hit it.  Called Barta Oil Company, and it   s still pumping. They drilled on this  farm once, but it was a dry hole. They didn   t get oil.  Could you go a little deeper?  I guess. I don   t know. But my dad always believed in keeping the  mineral rights. He would buy farms and then resell the farm and keep  the mineral rights.  Do you have those for this farm?  Yes, my sister and I.  So the first car was a 1956?  Actually our first car was a used 1950, a little sedan. Then we bought  the new car which was a 1956 Ford. And that   s the one we took all the  way to Washington.  What color?  27  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Finchum  It was green. It was green. And then we got a 1957 with the big fins on  it and it was orange and white. Then we got a 1959 Chevrolet station  wagon. Took it to Miami Beach to the OU football game which, in 1959.  Stay with relatives in that direction, too?  We didn   t have relatives who went to South. They all went to the West  and none to the East or the South.  So you were an OU fan early on?  No. No, we went to the game because it was an excuse to go to Miami.  So Dad went to the game, actually. And we were always at OSU games.  Dad would never miss an OSU football game and I always enjoyed  going with him. We were OSU fans.  They didn   t play on campus then. Did they? They had to go to Taft. Was  it Taft? Am I remembering right?  There were a few games moved to Taft but they did play some on  campus.  I don   t remember that.  Campus has changed a lot since the 1950s.  I know Dad helped build the Student Union building there on campus.  And then one of my cousins, one of the Barta   s, she   s an economist for  OSU, Suzette Barta. She works up there full time. I always enjoy  reading her articles. She has an article every week in the Perkins  Journal.  Still have connections all around, then.  Mm-hmm, yup.  Anything else you want to add before we cut off and get the grand tour?  Oh, I can   t think of a thing. You   ve covered everything. Yes, let   s drive  down and I   ll show you where the old homestead was.  Al right.  Or is.  Well, thank you for inviting us.  28  Brixey  Finchum  Brixey  Well, thank you for coming out.  It   s a pleasure.  And an honor.  -------  -------
