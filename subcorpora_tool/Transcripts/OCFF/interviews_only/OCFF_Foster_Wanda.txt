 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also joining me today is Tanya Finchum. Today is Friday June  5, 2009. We   re in Oilton, Oklahoma interviewing Wanda Foster. This  interview is being conducted as part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm  Families Oral History Project. Thank you for joining us today.  Basically, we   d like to start by you telling us how this land came into  your family   s possession.  In 1903, the allotments were made for the Indians   for the Creek Tribe.  Bill   s mother  my mother-in-law , at that time, was about four or five  years old and she got this allotment. It   s 160 acres. It runs a mile long  and    mile wide, and that   s how it came into the family. She was just a  young girl. She was an orphan at the time.  What can you tell us about her?  Well, after her parents died, she went to live with some people named  Thompson and the best I can determine is her mother was a Thompson  so it must have been a relative that she and her brother lived with. When  she got to high school they sent her to Philadelphia to a Presbyterian  boarding school  where  she studied home economics. When she  graduated she went back to the Eufaula area where she had originally  been. Somewhere in there they brought her up here and for the first time,  she saw her farm. And up to that time the Indian Agency managed it and  leased it to some cattle raisers   people that raised cattle. Then she  returned back to the Eufaula area and about three years later she had  married and she came to the farm for the first time. What I don   t know is  where they lived, there   s no house here. I haven   t heard anybody say  where they lived when they came to the farm. But eventually there was  really a shack down on the field. The foundation is still there, but it was  there until    51 and it burnt that year. So then, where she lived after that I  don   t know for about three years. In   54 her son Bill  my husband , built  5  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  her a little house that is no longer here. We tore it down after we  finished this house and she lived there until 1978 and we put her in an  assisted living situation because she was not able to stay on the farm by  herself. We moved into her house because we were starting on this  house and we did it more to protect the equipment, the tools and so  forth. We were living in Tulsa at the time. So we moved into that little  house and it was little. (Laughs) We lived there until I moved in this  house. My husband died before this house was completed.  And what was her name?  Louise Beartail.  When she was running the land at that time, do you know what crops or  animals     Cotton was raised.  Okay.  She divorced the first husband, but she had a son, John or Jack. They  called him Jack   his name was John. At that time, she was married to a  Hughes. She divorced him and then she married a Foster, Dallas Foster.  They had one son William. And Jack   he was always called Jack.  Legally, he was John Hughes. He was killed in World War II in  Czechoslovakia in a plane crash.  So in addition to the cotton, did the children help run the farm with her?  Really, there were some people named Baker that had a little house  further back on the farm and the Baker family basically, along with  Dallas Foster, Bill   s father, they raised the cotton. She was more or less  just a homemaker.  Would they bring in outside help to help pick the cotton?  I   m sure they did. I   m sure they did because it was a big crop here back  years ago. After that the land pretty well laid idle until about    59. There  were 12 oil wells during the oil boom on the farm. The last one was shut  down about three years ago.  Was she pretty wise with her mineral rights? She didn   t sign them over  to anyone right away?  Yes, she kept them. Bill, her son, there was two or three times she  wanted to sell the farm and he would not let her. He would not let her  6  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  sell the farm. She wanted to two or three times. But he said no and he  kind of got the Indian Agency to go along with him because they had to  approve everything.  Do you know of any other structures on the land, in addition to the little  house that Bill built back in those days?  There was one little barn and it   s been torn down.  And the water source?  Wells. Real good wells. We have two.  Were there any animals? Like pigs or     She never had any cattle. In    59, Bill and I bought some polled  Herefords and ran them along here. But she never had any livestock. She  just didn   t do much farming. Mainly just kind of   well the oil wells that  was her main interest.  When the oil wells were pumping, did the cotton kind of take a backseat?  After she divorced Bill   s father, not a whole lot happened. She went to  Oregon and I don   t know exactly whether she married a man or if she  was going to marry, but he was in the Lumber Business and they had a  cable that went across the Trinity River and he fell off and drowned.  Then she came back to Oklahoma and as far as Bill and I never knew  whether she actually married him or not, we don   t know.  How did she come to go to Oregon to start with?  She went to visit some friends   actually I think she said it was a cousin.  She went out there and visited and she ended up staying several months.  And we don   t know   she never would say whether she married him or  just was going to.  Then she had Bill   there were two sons.  Two sons.  And that was it?  That was it.  So at what point did you and Bill come to the land?  7  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  We got married in    59 and we came out here and the land was just  covered with pipe from the oil wells; just laying on the ground, dead  lines. We spent two or three years gathering up pipe and cleaning up the  ground and the farm was kind of overgrown with Johnson grass so the  cattle   we knew if we grazed it good enough that it would kill it out,  which it really did and we mowed it and we even baled some of it. But  we finally killed it out and got 65 acres that we could produce on and  then we went to Alfalfa hay and then we raised Alfalfa. Pretty well we  did it from    59 to    65. At that time, my husband, his health kind of failed  on him. He was on a body cast actually for a year, almost. We rented it  out then because running the balers and everything. So it pretty well  remained rented for several years until probably    80.  Well actually, the hired hand and I really run the farm because Bill   s  health wasn   t that he could. I had a hired hand that started in    79 and he  and I completely re-fenced it because the fences were so bad and we re-fenced  the whole place and did some terrace work and so mainly from  about    80 on, I was the farmer. My husband, during the    70s, he was in  politics. In    72 he was elected State Representative from Tulsa District  and he went to Oklahoma City a lot then. In    74 he was defeated in the  next election and the next day David Boren called him and said,    Bill, I  want you on my staff.    David Boren had just been elected Governor. So  Bill went in as his administrative assistant. And then about a year after  he became administrative assistant, the state labor commissioner was  impeached and David called on Bill again. He thought he should be the  labor commissioner. So he served as labor commissioner the rest of  David Boren   s term as governor and then for part of George Nigh   s  term. He gave that up in    79. Well, he was going to come home to the  farm but he was so used to being in politics and away from the farm.  Chief Cox of the Creek Nation asked him to come and build the bingo  hall in Tulsa at 81st and Riverside and manage it. So he built it and  managed it until he died in    89.  Nice long career in politics and serving the state.  He was gone because when he got sick in    65 after he got out to where  he was out of the body cast, he decided to go back to college. So he went  to Tahlequah and in three years, got his degree. We bought a trailer  house and put it down there and he lived down there. He actually lived  away from me more than he lived with me in all these years (laughs)  because he had his own house in Oklahoma City. I had a house in Tulsa  and we were building this house. So we always laughed, we were  weekend husband and wife.  While you were serving as the farmer in the    70s and    80s, can you  describe a typical day for me?  8  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Yes. Ed would come at eight o   clock (laughs) and I   d be ready to go to  and we worked outside all day. When we built that fence, there were  some days I think it was 100 degrees, but we were going to get that  fence built and we got it built. Along in there we built another barn out  of the pipe off the farm and Ed was a real good welder and he did the  welding. We built a cattle barn, actually, and now it   s not here anymore,  it blew away in    94. We had a tornado here. It blew that barn away and  blew a whole lot of the fruit trees and big trees we had. A typical day  was just working outside, actually improving the place was more what  we did. Built the fences, cleared some more field that needed cleared.  We had a lot of black jacks that were growing in a meadow and we got  rid of them. We worked on getting rid of that. We built two ponds,  stocked them with fish. Just all kinds of things. This was a very ugly  place in    59 when I first saw it because it was so overgrown with  Johnson grass and so on.  Well, it   s gorgeous today. Just driving up, it   s beautiful.  Well, we work hard at it.  What were the early fences made out of?  T-post. Yeah, still T-post. They were affordable then. Now they   re so  high I don   t think anyone could build a fence. (Laughs)  Have you walked all 160 acres?  Oh yeah. I   ve been over it all. (Laughter)  And do you still have the 160 in the family?  Yes, yes. I inherited it when Bill died.  Tell me a little bit about the structures on the property today.  Well, there   s a machine shed right outside the house here. We built it  around    78. It was one of the first big buildings we built because we  needed a place to put our tools and our tractors when we weren   t here, so  it was actually built before that. It was probably built in    75 because we  weren   t staying out here then. Bill   s mother was here. We didn   t expect  her to watch after things and that   s where we kept the machinery and the  tools and ran the equipment. Then my husband was a real antique car  buff, so we built a six-car garage east of there which we kept antique  cars in. After Bill passed away, I built the big barn in    90, the big rock  barn to match the house. That was my doing. I don   t think he would  have ever planned on building that barn, but I wanted a barn to match  9  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  the house and when I started getting exotic animals, I needed it for the  various animals. So that was my doing, to build the barn.  If you could take us through how your interest in exotic animals came  about.  Well, I had a friend in California who had exotic animals and she was  coming through and she was taking some animals to an auction in  Missouri. So she called and said,    If I fly in, will you go on to Missouri  with me?    So I said,    Yeah.    We took my pick-up and we went to  Missouri and I had no intention of buying anything. She had shipped, by  truck, some pot belly pigs and some Angora goats and other things she  had that she was selling. So I was going to watch them sell. So here they  come in the ring with a little black bear and I don   t know, I just started  bidding and pretty soon,    Sold to the lady in the trench coat up there.    I  thought,    I bought a bear     (Laughs) I knew nothing about bears     nothing. I didn   t know what you fed them. It was on the bottle. It was  only about four months old. So I come back and I don   t even have a  license to have a bear, so I had to hustle around to get a license to have a  bear and get federal approval and everything. Well I kept it for about  two months and it was so precious and I thought,    This is a little girl  bear, I need a boy bear.    I went to another auction and bought a little  boy bear. I named them Huggy and Snuggy.  Then, again, I went to some more auctions and I just kept buying things  and I had Wallabies and Nagoya Antelopes. I had Coons. I had Apes. I  had two little Celebes Apes. They were a nightmare  (Laughter) They  were so cute. Celebes Apes don   t get over 18 inches tall. But they   re just  like people. They   re just like people. If you do something and they see  you do it, they immediately do it. And one of   Luke, I named them  Luke and Lulu. Luke   s favorite thing   I had a friend that come over, he  worked here sometimes and he smoked and he   d blow smoke rings.  Luke thought that was the greatest thing in the world, putting his finger  in the smoke rings. Well one day, David put the cigarette in Luke   s  mouth and he right away took a big puff and he blew and it wouldn   t  make smoke rings and he just stomped his feet and he was so mad.  Every time that David would come, he would get excited and would start  jumping up and down. He wanted to smoke. (Laughter) And he learned  to smoke  It was so funny because he was really addicted. But he was  only 18 inches tall. They   re in Oregon now. They   ve had two or three  babies since I sold them. I sold all my animals when the tornado hit. In  about    95 I sold all my animals except the bears. I couldn   t get rid of  them. I was too attached to them.  What would you do with these animals?  10  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Sell the babies to various people.  And did you have a local vet in the area?  Yes.  And when they looked at these animals, they were like,    Wanda, I don   t  know what to do with this     (Laughs)  Well, they were pretty good at it, really. I had a zebra. I had miniature  horses and miniature donkeys. I can   t even think of all the animals I had.  I had peacocks. I had so many different animals and one reason I got rid  of them was I didn   t have any peace and quiet around here. People from  everywhere came driving up. I   d look up and there   d be people walking  around my yard, looking at all my animals. You know, they just thought  it was a walk-in zoo, I guess. Also, the feed bill was terrifically high      2,000 a month or so. Plus my hired help, because boy I kept those pins  shinin   . I couldn   t afford to have a dirty pin and someone walk up and  see it. You know what I mean? And I wouldn   t have anyway. So it was  just very expensive to keep these animals. But you asked about a vet, I  just never had any sick animals. Now bears have no diseases. And ticks  and fleas won   t even bother them. It   s just real strange. I   ve never had to  have a vet for the bears. I don   t know what I   d do if I did. You aren   t  going to go in and treat them. (Laughs)  So the two bears that you still have, are they your original two?  Those are the original two.  Huggy and Snuggy.  Huggy and Snuggy. The hired hands call them Ben and Molly. I don   t  know why. Ed was the one that named everything   my hired hand, Ed.  (Laughs) He came up with some of the darndest names for animals. But  he was always naming everything. So he called them Ben and Molly.  But I still call them Huggy and Snuggy. Sometimes I forget and I   ll even  say Ben or Molly.  And how many babies have they produced?  Thirty-five.  Wow.  A lot of times they   ll have four. Several times they had four. But out in  the wild, a mother bear will usually lose a couple in the cave in the cold  11  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  because they   re not real big milk producers. But because I pull them at  one month and take them from the mother, and put them on bottles and  get them ready to go, there   s usually one little runt when you pull them  at one month. But it, just in a few days, catches on a bottle and its back  up with the rest of them. But you usually find one that is just a little bit  littler. But if she would have kept them in the cave, she probably would  have lost that one. You know what I mean. But they only weigh six  ounces when they   re born. Now, you   d think six ounces, you   d hold  them in your hand, but they grow real fast and they hardly have any hair  when they   re born. They   re just like a little rat. (Laughs) Like a little  dog, when it   s born it doesn   t have much hair. But they grow hair real  fast and turn real black and bears have no natural noise   like my bears  they don   t bark, they don   t growl. They have no noise. That   s the reason  they can slip up on people so easily in the woods. They make no noise.  Now my female sometimes will go    woof    kind of   but she does it for  fun to kinda scare people. (Laughter)  Where are some of the places that your animals have ended up?  Oh, Pagosa Springs, Colorado; Cherokee, North Carolina; Wichita,  Kansas. Just different places.  Zoos?  In zoos and in petting zoos and so forth. I like for them to go to a zoo  rather than a petting zoo. I feel like they might be abused there.  Have you ever received any special training requests?  I gave a lot of talks on the bears. But as far as training, there   s not that  many breeders. There   s just very few breeders. So there   s no one to talk  to about it. I had a man come by the other day from Bristow who wanted  to raise bears and I told him what I knew and he wants to get into the  bear business. It   s not a real profitable business. You only get about   500 for a baby bear, so it   s not profitable. It   s just a hobby more than  anything.  Before we got started, you mentioned that one had gone to Disney World  and you had to train it to do  some things ?  Well, they called and they wanted one. See there   s a magazine called  Animal Finder   s Guide and I know the guy that writes that and so a lot  of times he gets called. Some people  say ,    We   re gonna get a bear.     Well he had given my name. I guess he was the one that gave them my  name and they called me and, anyway, they wanted it. They said it will  be in a show and be sure and make sure that it has, if you can, teach it to  12  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  wear clothes. So we bought little jump suits and it was taught to wear  clothes. And they really don   t mind. They kind of like it. And a bear, I  raised him right here in the house. I set up four baby beds. They had  their own bed and when you feed them, when you take them outside  (they always do their business within 15 minutes) twice in all those  years I had an accident and it was because I was washing bottles or  something and not watching the time. They   re not like a dog running  around the house and you leave and you have a mess.  Have you ever felt like you were in a threatening position with the bear?  No, no. My doctor laughs every time he sees me because I was putting  one of them   they   ve got real sharp toenails, these little babies, and I  was putting one in a pet box and it turned around like it was going to  argue and it didn   t want to go in and it caught me on the arm and it cut  it. I had to go up and have it stitched. But it wasn   t a threatening thing, it  was just an accident. In fact, I didn   t know until I looked down and it  started bleeding that it even cut me. So my doctor laughs about,    Well,  I   ve done everything now, I stitched up a bear wound.    (Laughter)  Well let   s learn a little more about you. Where did you grow up?  I grew up in Calumet, Oklahoma. I grew up on a farm. It was a dairy and  wheat farm. When I was about 14, I was driving a truck hauling wheat,  because you could back then. I was a very active in sports. I was an all-state  basketball player in high school. I was a National 4-H Garden  Champion. Very active in high school in lots of things. Then I went to  OSU and then I went to work for a public service company of Oklahoma  and that   s where I met Bill, when I was working there. He ended up  being my boss. I didn   t like him so I decided,    Well I   m going to get  another job.    So I took a teaching job at Vian, Oklahoma. I called him to  give him my two week notice and he said,    Well good. I   m glad you   re  quitting. Let   s go out to dinner tonight.    I turned to Ole Man Hardy and  the girl at the next desk, I said,    The son of a gun asked me to go out to  dinner with him tonight.    She says,    Go for a free meal.    I said,    Ok.     So I said ok to him. We went out and had a great time. Started dating  him. Well, I had already signed a contract to teach in Vian for a year so  we dated from Tulsa to Vian all that year and then we got married in  September the next year and I started teaching in Tulsa.  In 1970, I was chosen Outstanding Young Woman of Oklahoma for my  many activities. In 2000, I was chosen first place winner in a contest that  someone entered me in for Outstanding Senior Citizen and I won the top  prize in the nation and that was a  20,000 reward. And I gave 10,000 to  the Chamber of Commerce in Oilton because I   m very active with the  Chamber. And of course I spent  10,000 or put it in savings. So right  13  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  now I   m very active in the Chamber, in the Farm Bureau and I serve on  the Indian Electric Co-op Board of Trustees. I   ve done that since 1990.  I   ve been on it for 18 years. I served as President, Secretary, Vice  President   every office. I   m also serving right now as the state president  of the Electric Co-ops of Oklahoma of the Director   s Association. So  I   m currently the state president of that.  So you stay real busy?  Real busy. I helped form the Silver City Fire Department. We had  devastating fires here in    96. Everything on this farm   of the land burnt.  Very bad fires. So a group of us in the community formed the Silver  City Fire Department. I served as secretary treasurer of that for probably  four years and I gave it up because of lack of time. And I was having a  conflict of meetings with it and with meetings of Indian Electric and my  other activities, so I gave that position up. Still do things for them and  work with them.  How big of a community is Silver City?  Well, recently did a survey around here. There   s about a 120 homes  because we got so many of these five acre homes. If you go about two  miles each way from Silver City, just driving down the road but it don   t  look like that, but back in the fields from different places and there   s just  a lot of homes out here. At one time, I was the only one living on this  section. Now there are three houses just right here east of me. There are  two or three at the back behind my place and then the mess over there on  that side of the road. But there are houses everywhere. Our Silver City  Fire Department covers probably 250 homes.  Well tell me a little bit about the farm today. What   s going on?  We   re still farming hay and grass. There   s a meadow at the back and it   s  baled every summer and the front 20 is just, more or less, kept up like a  yard. We tried to keep it almost immaculate. We have, one, two, three  ponds on this front 20 and we have a lot of catfish and bass and I let kids  come and fish. We have a bridge down here and we have weddings on it  and that type thing. It   s more or less just kind of a show place for     people call me all the time,    Can we come out and make our wedding  announcement picture on your bridge?    And so on. It is pretty to be on  this bridge and then the water behind you and everything. That   s about  all the front is used for. But now the back we do farm and graze some  cattle.  Tell me a little bit about this beautiful home. Did you design it yourself  with your husband?  14  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  No, my husband spent two years drawing the plans. And that was    76  and    77. We started building it in    78. We did all of the woodwork. He  would measure something and send me to the saw and I   d cut it. Every  once in awhile I   d make a mistake, but that   s how we built it and some  weekends we would not get but one door jam in or we might not-- but it  took us from    78 and he died in    89. I finished it. When he passed away,  about a month after that I said,    It   s going to be finished    and I just hired  everybody I could find to come in and help paint and help do everything  because I was so tired of working on it weekends and I thought,    I   m  going to get it done.    So I finished, decorated it and moved in.  What did you teach?  Home economics and then when home economics went out, I was  basically put in charge of helping to design the special education  program in the Tulsa Public Schools. So I worked, really I taught, but I  was helping design it too for two years. Then they asked me to go to  Tulsa Boys Home which is a home for boys that are juveniles. I went  there for two years. Then I went to the Tulsa Juvenile Detention Center  for two years and I would have probably stayed there, but they moved it  out of the Tulsa School District when they built at Sands Springs the  new boys home. So that meant I had to go to the Sands Springs School  System, so I went to Webster High School and taught history and some  special-ed there the rest of my teaching time.  You said you graduated from Oklahoma A M?  Uh huh.  Can you tell us what year?     58.  And that was in home economics?  It was home economics. But later I went back and got a counseling  degree master   s and a master   s in home economics.  From OSU?  No, I got them from Northeastern. What I did was I went down at night  and took night classes when my husband was in college.  Well all that time you were teaching, you would just come to the farm on  weekends or to visit your mother-in-law?  15  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Just weekends, yeah. Worked weekends.  Did you ever spend holidays on the farm?  No, the house she lived in was so small that we just drove back and forth  to Tulsa. It was only about 40 miles.  Is there significance to this room?  Indian Room. That   s supposed to represent, that   s what he designed it as  an Indian Counsel Room and that   s the reason the ceiling is the way it is.  Multiple sides.  Uh-huh.  As we move forward, looking at the next 100 years for the Centennial  Farm. What do you see happening to the land?  That is a problem. I don   t know what I   m going to do. I   ve got it willed,  right now, to two people to sell. I think the only thing they could do is  sell it because I really don   t have anyone I really need to give it too. I  don   t have any nieces and nephews to give it to. So I really will  probably, well I   ve told those two to sell it and divide the money up,  give some to the hired hands. I   ve designated how much and what   s left  is theirs. That   s one thing I could do. I don   t really have anyone to really  will it too, but these people have been good to me.  Have you had the same help for years and years?  Yes, Ed has been with me since    78 and Dean, the one that   s working  today has been here since    94.  Well that   s nice.  Yeah, they   re very faithful. Dean will do anything for me. Ed would too.  And Ed, part time works at Webco in Tulsa and he   s working there  today. But he   ll be back Monday.  Talk a little bit for us how this area has changed because where we are  now, it   s really changed through the years.  It really has because it was the oil field back then and Silver City used to  be a city. It still appears on the map   Oklahoma map, but there   s  nothing there except two churches. One was a black church and the other  was a Free Will Baptist. Now the black church, I have a feeling is pretty  16  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  well closed because the family, there was a Moore family of black  people, they   ve all died in the last two or three years. So I don   t think  anything   s going on at that church, but the Free Will Baptist church up  there is pretty active. But there were two grocery stores basically. It was  hit with a tornado in    59. One blew away and was never built back.  There was a car lot. There were lots of things there. But when the  tornado hit in    59, it pretty well did Silver City in.  You know why it was called Silver City?  Who knows? I don   t think there was any silver there, but I really don   t  know. As you   ll find, this part of the country when the oil boom, it  was   people from everywhere were here. Oilton had a population of  over 5,000. People just put tents and shacks up anywhere because of  coming into work in the oil fields. I really think that the house, and I  can   t swear to it that Bill   s mother lived in on the farm, was probably  here when she came and was an oil field house. I kind of think that  might have been how she had to live because I never asked her. Never  thought to when she came up here, to move up here, where they lived.  But I kind of think that the foundation that   s down there in the field is  remnants of a house that might have been an oil field house.  At what point, did you start cleaning up the old oil equipment on the  land?  Yes, we spent months doing that.  At around what time?     59.     59.  Right after we were married. We bought a little Ford tractor and some  chain and a welder and we cut or we   d unscrew them because they just  went all over the   you couldn   t have farmed this place if you had  wanted to.  And what would you do with the material?  We used it to build fencing and barns. The barn out here is built from the  pipe. The one that blew away was built from that pipe. The fence  alongside the east side, my garden fence, is all done with that pipe that  we pulled out from the field.  We   ve noticed lots of re-use of materials on a lot of the farms that we  17  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  visit. So it   s good to see that. You mentioned a little bit of terracing.  Have you gone into any conservation efforts here on the land?  No, I   ve served on the Conservation Board of Creek County, but the  ponds just aren   t washing. But that would be the biggest thing because  we built them and ditches and places that wash pretty bad. There   s a big  creek that runs through the farm and it is   it needs attention, but I don   t  know what to do to it because it   s just so deep and big. And the water, if  it really rains up stream, it comes down through there like a river and  dumps into Buckeye  Creek  and then into Keystone  Lake  and if  Keystone is full of water, real full, it backs up to the edge of my farm  through Buckeye Creek.  Does the creek always have some water in it?  There are some springs that kind of feed it.  She chose wisely, or she didn   t choose. They chose for her.  They chose for her, uh huh. She was very fortunate because the    30s,  they built Highway 51 past here and that really got it out of the dirt roads  and so on. And it really needs to be re-built now, it   s pretty bad.  Do you recall any extension agents or any home demonstration agents  coming around?  She belonged to a home demonstration club all those years. I   ve dealt  with them a little bit down in Creek County   going down and getting  information and stuff, but there   s no clubs or anything around anymore.  Did she have her own garden to can?  Yeah she did raise a garden.  Would she have any favorite recipes that she would always have on  standby whenever you   d come visit her?  Every time we came she had fried chicken. (Laughs)  Really?  She always had fried chicken. That was kind of a laugh of ours. It was  the best fried chicken in the world though. She could really fry chicken  and she had some Indian recipes that were very good. Fried corn and I  don   t reckon here, but she could fry corn better than anybody. It was raw  corn off the cob, scraped and fried. I   ve tried it   doesn   t work. I never  18  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  could get it mastered. I   d stand there and watch her. I   d go home and try  it and mine wouldn   t turn out like hers.  Did she raise her own chickens if she had her own fried chicken?  No, but she just knew how to fry chicken. I mean she really knew how to  fix fried chicken and we always laughed,    Well, we   re going out there  this weekend, we   ll eat fried chicken while we   re there.    (Laughter). But  she always cooked for us, because we were always out working. She   d  cook for us and we   d come in and eat and then we   d go back to work.  Whose idea was it to move back to the farm, yours or your husband   s?  Oh, I think we always did intend to when she got to where she couldn   t  take care of it. We didn   t want to let it just lay idle. I think it was just  automatic, almost. Bill sold his house in Oklahoma City. We sold our  house in Tulsa and moved out here in    78. Moved into her little house  when she moved out.  Is there a family cemetery?  No there   s Brooks Cemetery about a half a mile from here up on the hill.  Towards Silver City?  No, the other way.  Would Louise quilt?  Yeah, she made a couple. I quilt like crazy. I   ve made 15 this winter. I  made 12 the winter before and I gave them all away. I don   t have one  right now to give away.  Not even one to show us.  I   ve got one on my bed. (Laughter) But, oh just like, we had a girl hurt  in a car accident. So right away,    Well do you have a quilt?    I took a  quilt into the bank and they set it up and sold chances on it to help pay  for her accident. I   ve done that twice this year   gave quilts and then if  people do nice things for me they get a quilt. There are a lot of people  around that have quilts.  Do you do them all by hand or by a machine?  No, I quilt them on a machine and then I have a lady that quilts them, in  fact, she   s got eight at her house now and she   s supposed to pick up of  19  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  the ones I made last winter. But I give them away.  In your spare time.  Yeah and then I do a lot of cross stitching, that there on the fire place.  Oh, throughout the house, there   s a lot of cross stitch I   ve done. I love to  sew.  Well, with a home ec background...  Yeah, I really like to sew and I like to garden with my 4-H gardening  knack. We have a beautiful garden this year. And we went a little exotic.  We bought some exotic green beans that are supposed to grow 36 inches  long and we bought those giant pumpkins that are supposed to get big  and they   re growing. I don   t know if they   ll make it or not, but we just  decided to go a little bit exotic along with the regular things.  I don   t freeze anything. I don   t keep anything. We give it away. I   ll take  a basket full of cucumbers into the beauty shop and say give them to  your customers. We just give everything away   tomatoes, everything.  Well it   s great to see that agriculture is still very much in your blood.  Oh, it will always be.  You have such a passion for the land.  We raise pretty flowers. This year, we got those 22 days of rain and it is  so dry right now. We   re having to water everything and flowers are not  coming out like they usually do.  What are your future plans?  Stay here.  Keep the bears as long as     Well, there   s no need to move. I   ll just stay here as long as I   m able to.  Quite attached to the land?  Oh yeah, I love it here. I just love it.  Alright as we head towards the end of our interview, were family  members ever born out here on the farm?  20  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Just Bill. He   s the only one that   s been born here.  So that   s quite impressive back in the old days.  Yeah, he was born here in 1930.  So they probably didn   t even have electric.  Oh, I don   t think they did. I   m sure they didn   t. Let   s see, no, they  wouldn   t have had.  That   s impressive. Now, you personally stay quite busy. Can you talk a  little bit about your work with the Indian Electric Co-op and how you  got elected?  Okay. I was approached by some of the employees. They wanted  someone to represent this district and they came and asked me to run and  I thought,    Oh gosh. I don   t know.    And so I ran and I won by four  votes. I   ve served on that board   I will complete 18 years, this October.  I   ve been on that board serving in every capacity from president to  secretary to vice president and head of the steering committee. And  following that, this was two years ago, I was elected to the presidency of  the state co-ops, statewide and there   s 28 co-ops in Oklahoma. I am now  serving as president for the state association, director   s association  which I   m the first woman to do that. I was the first woman on the board  of directors at Indian Electric. So I broke some ground and now  someone will follow me.  Well, that   s great. Now throughout the co-ops in the state, are there  more women who are serving?  There are three more that I know of.  Well still that   s a small number.  That   s a very small number. It   s a good ole    boys club in lots of ways,  but I feel like I have the respect evidently of all the men because of  getting elected to that office.  We talked a lot about your farm today and some of the things you   re  doing. Is there anything else that you   d like to add that we haven   t asked  you about?  I don   t think so.  We definitely appreciate your time today and contributing to our project.  21  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  All right.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
