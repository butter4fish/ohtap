 Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Today is September 14, 2012. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re with the Oklahoma State University Library,  and we   re conducting an oral history project called Centennial Farm  Families. So, thank you for having us today. And today, we   re in  Kingfisher County, in the town of Kingfisher, speaking with James  Gilmour and Gladys Hopkins in regards to the W.A. Cross Farm and the  James Gilmour Farm. Okay, let   s start with having you, James, tell us  how the Cross family came to Kingfisher County.  Well, Granddad Cross made the Run in 1892. That   s when they got this  farm.  Where had they come from?  They came from Iowa.  From Iowa.  Yes, they came from Iowa, here, in 1892, I guess, on a train.  But he didn   t get a farm, and he paid ten dollars for the one that he  homesteaded.  Yes.  Do you have any idea how he chose that particular piece?  I don   t know whether they had any choice or not, really, back then when  they lined up and I guess, made the Run. I guess they staked it, the way I  got it. They put a stake down. It was probably some of them farms that  5  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  was open to the people to make a run. I guess they made the Run and  when they found this area they put their stake in the ground, and I guess  they claimed that 160 acres. That   s the only way they could get it, I  guess.  Had he traveled here by himself or brought his family with him?  Well, I don   t know when, actually, the whole family came down or not.  Later.  Later, I think. I don   t know whether he came by himself when he knew  this land was opened up for the people to come and make their run on it.  There was a certain area, I guess. I don   t know. I understand they lined  up out here west of Kingfisher. I guess they had a horse or something. I  don   t know how they actually made their travel to where the farm was.  Was he married already, at that time?  Yes.  Yes, I think so. I don   t know whether they had     Probably about half of their children. (Laughter)  Yes, I think there was some. Then about three of the boys died here after  they came here. There   s a cemetery east of Loyal out there where our  grandparents, where they   re buried and two or three boys.  Three had diphtheria.  Yes, they   re buried there.  Two, two died from diphtheria.  So how many children were there?  Five and those two would have been seven.  Would   ve been about seven kids in the family, I guess, yes.  What was their primary crop or product that they farmed?  Yes, that was wheat. Wheat, basically, as far as I know, that   s all they  ever farmed is wheat, on the farm out there. They had it when they  homesteaded here, and then they had it when they farmed across the  6  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  road west of it. That   s all he ever farmed, as far as I know.  I believe so.  Yes.  Did they have to hire outside help?  I don   t think they did because they had enough boys to help do a lot of  the farming there. I don   t think they ever hired any outside help.  Did they have any outside income? Did they do jobs off the farm?  Not that I ever  knew of . Nobody ever said anything if they did. Mother  and her brothers, they farmed a little around there. One uncle had a  quarter   in fact, it   s still in the family. It   d be the southeast quarter from  where this quarter is. I think he was the only one that actually farmed.  His name was Jim Cross. The other brothers, they went and did other  things. They didn   t farm any.  Well, Fred tried to down in the Altona community.  I guess, yes.  And he had sweet potatoes, big crop, and got them on a train to head to  Chicago or somewhere, and they froze. That wiped him out so he went  to greener pastures in Washington State.  Yes, he moved to Washington State. He moved away from the state and  bought a little farm up there. I think they milked cows and farmed a little  up there in Washington State, north of Seattle, there. I don   t know if it  was only, what, twenty-five miles to the Canadian border or something  like that?  Yes.  Real close to Canada up there. They farmed up there.  Quite an adventurer to go that far.  Yes. (Laughter)  Yes.  Well, take us through how it came to be in your hands, then. Take us  through as it   s passed from     7  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Well, my mother   I don   t remember just how she wound up with this.  Well, they split, as you said, there was another 160 acres there.  Yes, across the road.  So, they divided it among the siblings, and she got eighty acres.  Yes, she got eighty of this original farm.  Of this 160, she inherited the eighty acres.  Yes, and then her brother   one of the other brothers had the west eighty  of that. Oh, let   s see. It went down to you and I and my brother, I guess,  the eighty. And then I bought out the sister and brother. My uncle had  the west eighty of this homesteaded place. He sold it to a neighbor south  of us for quite a while. Then it wound up they sold it off to another boy,  and then he gave up farming and wanted to know if I   d buy that. So, I  got to buy the west eighty of this home back. So, we got it back in the  family. (Laughs) And then the quarter across the road there, that went  down to my uncle there that had the southeast quarter. And then it  wound up passing on down to his kids. They still   be my cousins,  cousins still have the west quarter they still own across the road to us.  They still own it. It   s back in the Gilmour, now. Our two cousins, one on  the Gilmour side and one on the Cross side, they weren   t related, but  they wound up getting married. So, it   s in the Gilmour family, yet. A  couple places out there with my Uncle Jim Cross, it went back to his  daughter on one side and a Gilmour on the other side. So, it   s still  known as the Gilmour farm, really. (Laughs)  It stayed in the family. So, the Cross is currently 160 acres?  Yes.  A total of 160?  But under the name of Gilmour.  Gilmour.  Because he bought us out.  Yes, I bought out the brother and sister   s interest in that. Like I say, the  west eighty, this homestead place there, it finally got back to where I  kind of got to buy the eighty and got it back into the family. (Laughs)  8  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  On the Cross Farm, the house has been moved.  Right.  Right.  There   s no buildings there at all.  Do you have any memories of it, of spending time in that particular  house?  Yes, oh, yes.  Can you describe it a little bit to us?  Well     It tells right there. (Gestures)  Probably. (Laughs)  It was built in 1892 after the family arrived from Iowa. It had two rooms  upstairs and two rooms downstairs. And then the family increased to  include seven children, a larger home was built across the driveway by  Ora Bishop in    01, which would be this one. (Gestures)  Yes, that   d be that house there.  There was a driveway here and the original house was over here.  (Gestures) I don   t have any recollection of the original one, but this one  I do.  How was it heated? Do you remember?  Just with a stove. I imagine just a little   there really wasn   t gas or  nothing. Every day out there they just had a woodstove and used it there.  And if there was two bedrooms, did all the children sleep in one?  Yes.  I   m sure there was two to a bed and maybe three on cold nights.  (Laughter)  Yes, I imagine there wouldn   t be much   I doubt if the bedrooms were  9  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  hardly heated, I don   t suppose. Not at night anyway, I think we put on a  lot of covers, and that was it. I   d say it was.  Your father was raised in that house.  No.  In the newer one.  In the Gilmour house. It was our mother. This belongs to the mother   s  side.  Okay, gotcha.  Cross, yes.  Here   s the date when that house was moved to town. In    45, she says.  Yes, is that when we moved the house into town, there in 1945? I  couldn   t remember what year they moved that thing into town. That was,  I think, was about the last building on the place. Old barns and stuff had  been there so long they pretty well were dilapidated and they got burned  or cleaned up anyway. There wasn   t any     Do you remember when electricity came to that farm, roughly?  No, I sure don   t. I don   t know whether they     Not sure it   s even got it now, does it? (Laughter)  Yes, there isn   t nothing else there. There   s no electricity there.  But since you   ve had cattle and stuff, I don   t think there   s any     I don   t think there was ever   maybe the late   well, REA came into this  country out here in about 1937 or    38. I suppose they had that electricity  then for a few years. Like I say, my cousin     Now, Dorothy and Bill lived there, didn   t they?  Yes, yes. My cousin, she and her husband lived there for a while. I think  they had electricity when they lived there in the late-   30s, early-   40s. I  don   t know when Bill and Dorothy got married there. It must   ve been  about 1940, wouldn   t it? Around there. (Laughs)  Yes, somewhere in that neighborhood. I don   t know.  10  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  They lived in this house for a while. I don   t think anybody even farmed  it.  Do you remember visiting it?  Yes. Yes, I can remember going over there when I was a kid. Like I say,  when one of my cousins first got married, I remember staying all night  there a time or two. I was probably ten or twelve.  Did it have indoor plumbing at that time?  No, no. Oh, no. They had outhouses out there. (Laughter) Yes, there was  an old cellar right kind of off the edge of the house, some way there, that  you can still see kind of the hole in the ground where that was. And then  there was a dug well there. That   s where they got the water. It   s still  partly there, yet. I   ve covered it up there. I farmed it then for   up until I  retired there. I   ve got a neighbor that lives right south and has a quarter  south of it. He farms normally about thirty-seven acres of farmland on  the whole farm, is all it was.  This says,    Family members dug a sixty-seven foot well by hand, only  to discover the water was very hard. Although, it was much appreciated,  a heavy supply of homemade lye soap was required for the laundry.     (Laughter)  Yes, I mean, that in there was hard land down in there, ole red clay stuff.  Water was hard to come by out there, anywhere.  Would you go out for holidays, like Christmas and Thanksgiving, to this  particular house? No?  I don   t ever remember much going out there.  No.  They always came to our house, I think, over to our folks    house.  Yes, see, my grandmother died when I was an infant. She died in 1936,  so I never knew her at all. Now, the grandfather then came and lived  with the Gilmour family for a short, oh, three or four years.  Yes, out here at that house there, he came and stayed with our folks  there his last two or three years.  Something like that.  11  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  So, that was probably about 1945, wasn   t it?  Yes, when     That   s about the time when we sold that house out there in the country  and the fellow moved it to Kingfisher. So, that was kind of the end of  that deal.  On the Cross Farm, have there been any conservation efforts, like  terracing and that type of thing?  Yes, that farm ground there, I   ve got two or three terraces on that. Yes,  had it terraced. Yes, it was   in fact, they drilled an oil well out in the  farm ground. They abandoned it, finally. We got one oil well on the east  eighty, I call it, still there. One well there.  It   s in pastureland, though.  But it   s all pasture where that well was. There   s two ponds out there, but  there   s one   I don   t know. They built that and I don   t know, does it say  anything about when they built that one? I don   t know. Some fellows  here from Kingfisher and     Dr. Pendleton.     a doctor and two or three of these fellows here from Kingfisher, they  talked their granddad into letting them build a big pond out there,  hunting. They duck hunted and everything else out there. In fact, the old  pond, I guess it was real deep at one time. Our brother and a neighbor  friend of his, they went out there and caught some fish that weighed  forty-five pounds, catfish. (Laughs) But it kind of settled in and to where  it got so shallow and dry so my dad, he built another pond behind it and  it stays water all the time. This original pond, it went dry this summer.  There wasn   t any water in it.  Yes, a lot of things went dry this summer. (Laughter)  Yes. A lot of them went dry, too, but it got down to where it wasn   t  probably over about a foot deep when it was clear full. So, it didn   t take  long for it to dry up if there wasn   t any water running. There was a little  water in it here a month or so ago. It rained enough to put a little bit in  the upper pond.  So what   s currently going on with that particular farm?  12  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Well, like I say, I rented it to the neighbor south of me. He runs cattle on  the pastures, but he farmed a wheat ground there and had it in wheat the  last few years there. Other than that, that   s about it. (Laughs) Like I say,  that   s real hard ole clay soil out in there. It didn   t rain this summer, the  pasture is about the color of these walls. (Laughs) Yes, there wasn   t a  green spot on it. We   ve had a few showers here back in August. I drive  out there every week or two just to look around, and it greened up a little  bit. The grass on it was about that tall. (Gestures) I think he moved his  cows off of it because it got so short there just wasn   t nothing there to  eat. But it   s kind of greened up here a little bit this fall.  So your mother grew up there?  Yes.  Yes.  Was there a school in the community there where she would attend?  Yes.  Well, our granddad helped build one. Where did I see that?  It was a place there with a house there. It would   ve been a mile east, a  mile south, the school. That   s where our mother and her brothers all  went to school there. In fact, our mother, she got her teacher   s  certificate. She taught school there about six years. And then they moved  that schoolhouse. It   s up here in town at the     At the museum.     museum, now.  It   s called the Gant School because it was built on Gant family property.  Some of that family did reside in Stillwater, and I don   t know when our  mother passed away in    89, I think we got some correspondence. But  they would be getting older so I don   t know if they   re still in existence  or not. I   m trying to see what she said about the Gant School, about  Granddad helping build it.  Do you think it says in there?  Yes, I saw it in here once, but I couldn   t find the   she had talked about  how she and her sister had to walk this mile and a half on the diagonal,  probably. And then her brother cut the fences so they could get through.  (Laughter)  13  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Yes, from their house out there, it would   ve been diagonally across that  section. Then you came out just where that schoolhouse was. If you  went by the road, you   d have to walk two miles to get to school.  And then it was real cold one winter at the school. Their supply of coal  used to fuel the stove and heat the schoolhouse began to run low. Mrs.  Gilmour said,    We were getting upset and suddenly, the students could  see somebody riding one horse and leading another. To the delight of  Mrs. Gilmour and her sister, the man turned out to be their brother,  James Cross, who was still living at their home.    He had come to take  them home. This was when they were students. (Laughter) I   m still  trying to see where     Yes, I don   t know about     I know she wrote on there where he served   okay.    My father, W.A.  Cross, helped build the first Gant Schoolhouse after he came to  Oklahoma.    It doesn   t say the year. She kept pretty good records, but not  when you   re trying to establish a timeline. (Laughter)  At least there   s something, though.  Well, it   s good, and I   ve got boxes and notebooks and stuff from when  she lived with us her last six or seven years of her life. And she was  basically in good health, but she would get an idea in her head   that was  before we really thought about recording things, and that was from    83  to    89. She would jot down things about family members, which is a  help if you want to go back and read through all of it. (Laughter) And  toward the end of her life, I began to know that her lifespan was about  over, because she was eighty-eight when she passed away. I got an  eight-track out and was recording, and she wouldn   t talk. I don   t know  whether she got the idea of why I had it out or what, but she was very  talkative until I   d get the microphone out, and then she might say three  or four words. That   d be it. (Laughs)  Wouldn   t give us   let out any information.  I didn   t get much of this recorded, which is sad. Yet, we do have a lot of  it documented. Like I said, if we just had the time to get it all in  chronological order.  Do you have any personal memories from the Cross Farm that you want  to share?  From that particular farm, I really don   t other than about the lake. One  14  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  year, of course, I was still at the Gilmour Farm and we had relatives  from Iowa that came. We had very cold weather, and we went ice  skating on the Cross lake.  Yes, I remember going out there and skating.  I   ve got pictures of that.  Yes, we did have a few pictures of that.  Our dad and brother and their sister all had ice skates that clamped onto  your shoes. My dad built metal supports to go up mid-ankle high or a  little more.  Had a flap that would go about that high above your ankle (Gestures), so  you wouldn   t     Wouldn   t tilt over so much. And that   s the skates we used, was the ones  they had used. I still have a pair or two of them, I think, because I hang  onto     Oh, yes. (Laughter) Those ice skates     So, we ice skated a lot on the Gilmour Farm pond because it seemed like  when we were children, we had a lot of snow and ice cold weather.  Yes, it seemed like we had a lot of cold weather. I know that ice would  get six to eight inches deep on that pond.  Yes, very safe to be on.  In fact, I don   t know whether there   s any pictures of that or not, I don   t  remember. The folks over there at the Cross lake drove a car out on there  one time. (Laughs)  I don   t know about that.  Yes.  I know my son did it in Minnesota and when he told me, it scared me to  death. But I found out the ice was ten feet deep or something, up there.  (Laughs) Maybe not quite that deep. Deeper than here.  So your parents, your mother taught school     Yes.  15  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Yes.  Did you father just farm, or did he do something else?  Yes, he basically did farm. He was in World War I, stayed in the army,  and then he got out, stayed in the national guard. He got to be company  commander of the whole armory here in Kingfisher. He liked to fool  with that a lot. (Laughs)  You got a little supplemental income from that.  I suppose. I imagine very little at that time.  I guess he did. Probably back then, it was probably very little. Got a  little I   m sure because like in the summertime, they   d go to Fort Sill for  a two-week training deal, the local boys. They did that until about 1940.  When World War II broke out, he was about forty years old. I think he  was just on the line, and rather than go to the army, leave us kids, he got  out of the army in about 1940 and didn   t have to go then.  Well, being a farmer, there were some exemptions and things along that  way.  Yes, he was farming about three quarters of land at that time.  Yes, it   s been a military family. As he said, our dad was in the military.  Jim was in the navy. The brother that lives in Utah was in the navy     well, I better back up a generation. Our dad was in the military, his  brother was in the military, and their sister was a nurse during World  War II and was stationed in England. So, those three were all in the  military. Now, I   ll get to the next level. Brother Jim was in the navy, and  the other brother was also in the navy.  Yes, during the Korean deal.  So there were three children, then?  Yes, there   s three of us that are original Gilmours, I guess you   d say.  And what   s the order?  I   m the oldest one and then my brother and then she   s the baby.  I   m the baby spoiled sister. (Laughter)  16  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  We can go out to the Gilmour Farm.  The Gilmour will be no problem because it   s good roads, but the other  one could be a little slick today.  Yes, you wouldn   t want to drive out there in that. You   ll be out there in  about four or five miles of muddy roads. (Laughter)  Yes, that is not too good.  You don   t want to get in trouble out there.  Okay, so, it   s the three of you. Where is it going from here, the Cross  Farm, moving forward?  My girls, I   ve got three girls. None of them live here. They   re all  Bartlesville and Edmond and Texas   Dallas. (Laughs) So, it would go  to them someday. What they   ll do, they   ll probably eventually sell it, I  imagine. Nobody   s going to be farming anymore in the family.  Yes, their three sons-in-law are all professional other things, so it   s sad  in this community. When we were growing up, there were houses every  quarter   well, not quarter, but half-mile, and they all had children, a lot  of young men. None of those young men except Jim and one other  stayed with the farms. They got an education and did other things.  That   s just like where our house is out there now, there was one, two,  three    On that road there, there was about five more houses, used to be.  They   re all gone, burned them or got rid of them. Yes, there   s very few  older houses left out there. Of course, there   s no new houses being built.  No new ones are being built either, so it   s just farmland and pasture for  the most part, especially out where this Cross area is.  Okay, well, let   s switch gears and move to talk about the Gilmour Farm.  To the Gilmour one, okay.  So, tell us how they came to be in Oklahoma.  Well, I don   t know exactly how they actually   I guess they heard that  the land was cheap, I suppose, in Oklahoma. That Gilmour family came  from Illinois. Our granddad came down here in, like I say, 1904. I don   t  know whether he just   he bought that farm then.  He purchased it?  17  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Yes, in 1904. I don   t even know what they gave for it.   5,000 dollars.   5,000 dollars.  See, it went up, didn   t it? From 1892     For how many acres?  160.  Was it 160?  160 acres there, yes. So, they came down here in 1904. Well, our dad  and his brother, they were born in Illinois.  So he was married when he came, too, then?  Yes because our dad was born in 1900, and then they came here in 1904.  I think our aunt, I think she was born here in Oklahoma.  I believe so.  I think she was born in about 1906, wasn   t it?  I think so.  So how many children for that family?  Well, there was three.  Three.  Just three?  Three, two boys and a girl, there.  Okay.  Dad and his brother and sister. Our aunt there, she was a nurse. She  never married. She never married in her whole life. But our uncle, Geen  was his name, he was, like I say, he was in the military during World  War II, and then he got an education in teaching when he came back.  We got a school here in Kingfisher that   s named after him. It   s the  18  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Gilmour School here, the junior high school here. He spent all his life in  the teaching profession. (Laughs)  He was principal at that school for a good number of years and that   s  one reason. The school was built about the time he was retiring so it was  named after him.  They named it after him.  So he chose not to farm?  Yes. There   s another son that didn   t stay with the farm.  So that   s how your father came to have it?  Yes.  Yes, yes. I guess he bought out his sister   s and brother   s interest, I  suppose, from way back there. It never really did say how they...  How did it come to you?  Well, it came to my sister and brother and  me . I bought out the sister  and brother eventually, on the home place there, yes.  And what was it primarily used for?  It   s all wheat, wheat and cattle.  And always has been?  Yes.  When he bought it, too?  Yes, it was always farmed way back there in the early day when they  came here, I guess, and started farming.  This says the family   this is on the Gilmours, now, when our granddad  came      The family livestock and farm equipment were shipped by rail  in two cars, with Mr. Gilmour riding the freight cars and other members  of the family coming by passenger train.     Coming from Illinois. (Laughs)  Yes, see, that   d been the mother and two small children, a four-year-old  19  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  and a three-year-old.  Yes.  Had they farmed before they came?  Yes, they had a farm in Illinois, there. I think it was about one hundred  miles southwest of Chicago is where they were raising hay from. They  had a farm up there.  Troy Grove.  Troy Grove, yes.  Home of Wild Bill Hickok, this says. (Laughter)  With our aunt there, one time I went with her up there to visit some of  her friends, I guess it was, up there at this Troy Grove, little town about  like Kingfisher. That   s the only time I was ever back there, as far as I  know. (Laughs) I went up there.  Do you know what brought them here? I mean, why Kingfisher?  What?  Do you know why they came to Kingfisher?  No, I don   t know, unless the land was cheap down here or something or  they didn   t like the terrible cold weather up there, maybe. I don   t know.  It   d get a lot colder and the winters was a lot harder in Illinois than they  were down in here. I don   t know, really. I ever did hear them say why  they really came down here, unless the land was cheap. Of course, back  then, I know it was a lot cheaper than it was in Illinois.  When they purchased the property, was there already a house on it, or  did they have to build?  There was a house there on this Gilmour place there. I don   t know  whether there   s any pictures of that.  It says the original sod and shanty-type housing   see, this had been here  fifteen years. It says there were roads and things like that were laid out.     The original sod and shanty-type housing had been replaced by  carpenter-built western frame construction.     I think there   s a picture of the house back in there. That was off the  20  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  driveway where that house is now. But that house was built in 1917.  That   s the one you grew up in, then?  Yes.  Describe the inside of it.  It   s got   actually, the original house there was four rooms downstairs  and four rooms upstairs. It had a basement in it.  Big house. Full basement   well, it wasn   t full.  About a quarter-basement in the house. There was a quarter-basement in  the house, there. Like I say, there were four rooms. They had cistern  water. Out there, they have a cistern. It   s still there, in fact.  Where was your room?  Well, it was up with my brother. We all three slept upstairs, each one  had our own room upstairs. Folks slept downstairs, in one bedroom  downstairs, and a living room, and a dining room, and a kitchen  downstairs. We didn   t have a bathroom until about 1947, I think. Indoor  bathroom, they didn   t build. (Laughs) Actually, it was kind of funny.  They put a bathroom upstairs when they built the house.  A room for it. (Laughs)  They had a room. Well, they had to run a pipe and stuff up there, a place  for a stool and a tub, but they never put it in there because I guess they  didn   t have enough water back then. They didn   t get electricity until     REA came in there about late-   30s, I guess, when they got electricity in  there. But they never did put a bathroom upstairs until I moved there.  We put in a stool and a sink and everything upstairs so the girls could  have a place to go to the bathroom. (Laughs) Then my dad in   I think  that was 1947, they did build on a bathroom downstairs, there, and we  got an indoor bathroom, shower, sink, and stool.  Was living in high cotton then, huh?  Yes.  We had what was called a washhouse. It was where the laundry was  done, a separate little building just kind of off the back porch.  Yes.  21  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  That was after electricity got there, why, Mom had an electric     Washing machine.     Maytag washing machine that you washed in that a while, and then  you put it over here to rinse, and then you put it over here to rinse. And  then of course, you hung it on the line. That   s where we showered. My  dad took a milk bucket and fixed like your sprinkler can with the holes  in it. He welded that or soldered it, probably. It had a switch. You could  turn it off and on and had a pulley rope, and that   s where we all  showered.  Put our water in that, had a little room about four foot square off the  corner of this little room out there. Our shower had a cement floor in it.  It drained outside. (Laughs)  Had a butane stove to heat the wash water, and you could heat in  another     Got to heat that room up in the wintertime.     heat the water, actually, on that stove and have some warm water in  your shower. But before, in the wintertime, we took our baths in the  kitchen in one of the washtubs.  It was round tubs, wasn   t it?  Square.  Oh, was it square? I don   t know.  Because I got, not two of ours, but two of somebody   s in my backyard  now. (Laughs) I got to be first, of course. (Laughter)  Being the girl     And they took   I don   t know how they took their turns, but they took  their turns. This, of course, doesn   t   our great-grandfather was a native  of Dunlop, Scotland, and he migrated to Canada at the age of eighteen  and then on to Illinois. That   s where we get our conservatism, I think, is  from our Scottish ancestry. (Laughter) I get accused every now and then  about,    You   re too Scotch     I said,    Well, I was raised that way.     (Laughter) Waste not, want not, I think, was the old saying.  Yes.  22  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Were either one of you involved with 4-H, since you lived on the farm?  Well, I was in the 4-H right when I was probably thirteen or fourteen,  started out in 4-H. And then as soon as I got to high school, freshman,  then I got in the FFA, there. Yes, I was a FFA guy. Yes, I stayed in that  until I got American Farmer Degree back there in 1951, I think it was. I  went to Kansa City and did that. Other than that     Did you always plan to be a farmer? I mean, is that what you wanted to  do?  Yes, pretty much. Pretty much, yes, I grew up and pretty much   my dad  had a threshing machine back there in the late-   30s and early-   40s. They  went and had bundles out in the field. I started out with that when I was  a kid, there. About the early-   40s, there, the horses had pretty well gone  out, so they started pulling a bundle wagon with little tractors. A friend  of mine, a neighbor there, we had a little tractor. We took turns driving  that out in the field for the boy that pitched the bundle. We weren   t big  enough to do that, but we got to haul the bundles to the threshing  machine. My dad, there, they kind of custom threshed. All our neighbors  out in there, get theirs threshed and then go to the neighbors and get  theirs threshed for them. That   s kind of how we started out being a  farmer, I guess. (Laughs)  Talk about lightening the load, this says,    A second-hand tractor was  bought in 1919, and that lightened the load of the horse and speeded up  the farm work.    So, that was the first Granddad tractor, was in 1919.  In fact, the one my dad bought in 1936, I   ve got it out there at the corner.  I had it restored here four or five years ago like it came in the factory.  And it works?  Yes.  It   ll start, at least?  Yes, we run it.  It works. He works it.  Yes, it   s an International Harvester and the boys out north of town here,  Case International dealer, there, they have an annual feed once a year in  the spring. We brought it in there a time or two just to show it.  (Laughter)  23  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Let me back up a minute, then. What year were you born?  1930.  1930, and then   ?     36.  Here in Kingfisher County?  Yes, we were both born here.  We were all born in, quote,    our Aunt Mary   s hospital.     Yes.  The nurse hospital. She had gotten her nursing degree, and she and a  friend opened a hospital here in Kingfisher. All three of us were born in  that hospital. At that time, the mothers had to stay in the hospital about  ten days and had to go home to the farm by ambulance. (Laughter)  Yes, they really kept them in the hospital a long time. (Laughter)  Times have changed. (Laughter)  My, how times have changed  Their daughter is an OB/GYN physician,  so they know     Over in Edmond, yes.     they know about how long they let these mothers stay in, which isn   t  very long anymore.  One day and they   re going home.  Where did you go to elementary school, then?  Right here, Kingfisher.  He went one year at the country school.  And then they closed it.  Called Burson School, which was the one that     24  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  That old place there was a mile north and a mile east from where we  lived, two miles from where that house is, there.  How would you get there?  Well, we walked. (Laughter) There was a neighbor half a mile north that  was going there, too. We   d walk over there if the weather was good. If  the weather was bad, the folks would take us in the car. So, we went one  year over there and then they closed the school and so started at  Kingfisher, then. They didn   t have buses until about 1948, I think,  before they got   Kingfisher had buses. Before that, my neighbors  around there, two or three of the folks would get together and pick us up  and take us to school in the morning. And maybe one of the other ones  would pick us up at four o   clock and bring us back home. (Laughs) So,  that   s the way we got to school for quite a little while there, until they  started running buses, I think, in about    48 before they had school buses  here in Kingfisher.  And that   s about the time you graduated?  Yes, I graduated in    49 so we didn   t get to ride the bus very long.  (Laughs)  People were much more friendly in those days because they didn   t have  TV and they didn   t have all this other electronic gadgets. Little sidebar  here, I don   t know if something was mentioned about old-time records.  Our son lives here in Kingfisher and has a twelve-year-old son, and he  said,    I bet he has never seen a vinyl        Record, yes.        record        Forty-five or 78.        or the plastic 45   s or LP   s, 33   s, or probably doesn   t know what a  cassette is or an eight-track,    because all of that   except I   ve got them  all. (Laughter) And I have a player that will play all of them  (Laughter)  Our son said,    We   re going to have to get him over there and show him  how it was back when he was a kid,    the father, when he was a kid.  (Laughter)  The lady that they bought the farm from in Dover, she had the old  Victrola with the round ones. They were different, you don   t see those  anymore either. (Laughs)  25  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  No, I have one of the old Victrola round, whatever they call them to  play.  Yes, there are a few of them left. They   re fragile.  Anyway, you asked once about if there was any additional income.  Well, for him, they trapped skunks and possums and once in a while,  they   d get a mink.  Oh, yes.  Wouldn   t bring any money, but one year there was a lot of snow, and he  and his friend went shooting rabbits. That   s why we don   t have any  rabbits on our place. (Laughs) I don   t know. They had seventy-five of  the animals.  Yes, we got forty-seven that afternoon. They turned school out because  they thought we was going to have a blizzard. It kind of let up, we got in  the pickup, and we started driving the country roads. Every black spot  you   d see in the snow was a jackrabbit. (Laughter) We shot forty-seven  that afternoon. (Laughs)  Now, you don   t see them anymore. (Laughs)  I don   t remember that number, but they hung them up on the barn, which  we have a picture of somewhere of all of that.  Yes, there   s a picture somewhere.  And did what with them? Have them for dinner? Rabbit stew?  (Laughter)  Yes, could   ve, I guess. I don   t know.  Occasionally, Mom would fry one, but pretty tough meat.  It   d be after a heavy frost before you eat a rabbit in the winter. You   d  have to do it in the summer.  Now, we have no jackrabbits, ever since.  Yes, there   s not any jackrabbits. I don   t know what   s happened to them.  Coyotes get them.  You just don   t see one anymore.  26  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  The only thing left is armadillos, migrated up from Texas. (Laughs)  Wish something would eat those.  We have armadillos, but we sure don   t have any rabbits anymore.  Did you have chores that you had to do every day on the farm?  Oh, yes. Yes, we had to help feed the cows and stuff like that in the  wintertime.  Well, they had sheep. Our dad had a lot of sheep.  Dad kept about fifty head of sheep out there. And even after I started  farming, we raised sheep up until not too many years ago.  Did they designate girls    and boys    jobs, or just everybody did  everything?  I got to stay in the house. One thing, talking about him wanting to  always be a farmer   I meant to interject there. Mother missed him one  day. She looked out and Dad was in the field, oh, eighth of a mile,  diagonal up there. And there he was, I don   t know, he was three years  old or something. He was going to go get on the tractor with Dad.  (Laughter)  Yes, that happened every once in a while. I always would take off.  The two of them, I guess, then, when the other one was old enough to  trot along. But talking about memories in the house, of course, as he  said, we slept upstairs and there was a grate in the top right above the  floor furnace on the first level. There was this opening up to the upstairs,  and you could open that to let a little heat come up there. We had no heat  in that upstairs.  Yes, didn   t have any heat up there.  We   d go to bed with a hot water bottle or just quart-jar with hot water in  it, wrapped around. That   s the way we sort of kept from freezing by the  time we   d get to sleep. When that was open in the winter and dad would  go out and find that he had a newborn lamb that needed help, he would  bring that lamb in the house, put it in the box, and set it on the furnace so  it would get warm. Of course, that newborn sheep smell came upstairs.  (Laughter) It probably didn   t smell too bad downstairs, but whew  It  came right upstairs.  27  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Nykolaiszyn  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  The cute little lambs going out to the pasture, they jump. They   re so  cute  (Laughs)  Yes, they jump.  They jump in the air, yes.  My dad usually kept about three hundred laying hens.  Yes, we had about three to five hundred chickens.  Chickens all the time. That was a cash crop for them. Are you a chicken  person?  Well, I think everybody has a technique when it comes to butchering a  chicken. Does your family have a technique?  Took a knife and chopped them up, which hardly any women would  know how to cut one up nowadays. Run them through those saws, like  they put     But how would you slaughter them to begin with?  Oh, how you slaughter them?  Wring their neck, I was thinking. (Laughs)  Dad chopped off a tree     Had a tree stump out there with a couple nails about that far apart     Two nails sticking up, like that. (Gestures) You put the head between the  nails and clink  You could pull it off if they were real tender or chop  them with the hatchet.  And whose job was that? Did you both have to do it?  Well, I think my dad did most of it.  Dad did it when they   d go to the field.  His mother cleaned them.  And Mom and I, when I got old enough, she and I pretty much did it.  28  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Didn   t they dip them in hot water, then?  Boiling water to get the feathers off.  Then they   d pick the feathers off easy, come off real easy.  Then you had to pick the feathers off, and then you had to gut them, and  then you had to cut them up. That was a major spring rite, I guess you  would say. (Laughs)  Very few people know how to cut up a chicken. My girls don   t.  (Laughs)  That   s what we were saying, the way they butcher them and have them  in the stores it doesn   t look like     Yes, they   re not cut the same way we did.     the pieces of chicken like we cut them.  Did she have a big garden?  Oh, yes.  Yes, we had a pretty good garden all the time.  We had an orchard with all kinds of fruit trees.  Yes, we had a pretty good sized orchard right north of the house out  there. We probably had forty trees. Peach trees and plum trees and     Apricot and pears     Apricot, yes.  Pears and     So she canned a lot, too?  She canned.  Oh, yes. She canned everything.  Everything was canned originally. She never owned a deep freeze. We  had what we call lockers here in Kingfisher that you could rent and put  your butchered meat and chickens in there.  29  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Yes, take your chickens or butchered meat, if you butchered a calf or  something   well, they actually butchered them right by that locker  down there.  Yes, I guess they would.  You   d bring a calf down there alive and they   d butcher them. Then  they   d cut them up into hamburger, steak or whatever and then you  rented a locker, frozen locker down there. Then you had a key, I guess.  You could come down there any time you needed meat, go back and  open you locker and get whatever you wanted out of there.  When did that stop? Well, I guess when refrigeration came in   or deep  freeze.  Well, deep freezes became popular and people then had them in their  own home and didn   t need that service anymore.  Yes, they quit doing that.  It originally was an ice plant before refrigerators. They were ice boxes.  You probably don   t know about that. (Laughter)  Yes, you can go down there and buy     Buy your block of ice.  Buy a block of ice.     a forty, fifty pound chunk of ice down there. They   d carry it out and  wrap it in a sack or something until you got home. It wouldn   t melt  much. Then you could put it in your old ice box, they called them. Yes,  it wasn   t electric or nothing, you just stuck you ice in there. It   d last, I  don   t know, a few days before it     I was pretty young at the time, but the main refrigerator part was stuck  out on our porch, our back porch. And then just mostly the door came  into the kitchen. So, the ice was     Yes, it was kind of built in there.  You could just put the ice in the back. Our dad was not educated. He  went through the eighth grade. But he went to some kind of a trade  school up in Kansas, and he had a lot of natural mechanical ability,  apparently. He could build most anything. He   d come up with these  30  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  innovative ways of doing things. Like we had no air conditioning. Well,  he cut a hole   Mother had a cabinet kind of like this and went through  into the dining   I mean, dining was over there, and there was a door  down here for storage. (Gestures) Well, he cut a hole in the floor, and  you could get that damp, cool basement air up. Had a big fan down there  that would blow that up. When we were in the kitchen and were hot,  we   d open the door and some fairly cool air would come in here. Then if  you were feeding the threshing machine crew, you   d shut this door and it  would come in     Over on the other side.     into the dining area. He just came up with all kinds of things that you  had to do because we didn   t have central heat and air. (Laughs)  Did you add it when you moved into that house?  Yes, heat and air conditioning.  Yes, we put in heat and air conditioning. When we moved in there, I  guess, that   s when we got in central heat and air.  Yes, probably shortly after you were there.  Yes.  So once you graduated from high school, then you stayed on the farm?  For a short while, then you married me.  Yes, I was going to get drafted, so I got in the navy in 1951. Two years,  I went the east coast on a ship out of Boston and Newport, Rhode Island.  Then I got to travel the world.  Yes, he was lucky. (Laughs)  Eighteen months, I got about twenty-one different countries and islands.  They went to Europe, they went to Africa, they went to     Europe and South America     At Cape Horn, they escorted an aircraft carrier that was too big to go  through the canal. And then getting back to California, they came back  to the canal and went back to Rhode Island.  31  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Yes, went through the Panama Canal. Then we went to Europe and  Scotland, Norway, Portugal, France. (Laughs)  Saw the world, then he came back to farm and get married. (Laughter)  He didn   t want to go anywhere, he   d been everywhere. (Laughter)  Yes, he   d already been everywhere.  At what point did you buy and move back into the family house, then, the  family farmhouse?  Nineteen sixty-four.   Nineteen  sixty-four.  Came back and rented some land, farmed. We lived about six miles  northwest of that home place there, east of Loyal. Have you been out to  Loyal?  West of town, they moved up there.  Six miles east of Loyal, right on the blacktop road there, there was a  creek there. We farmed there for, what? Nine years I guess it was.  Yes, in    64.  Then my folks moved to town so then that   s when we moved to the  home place then, in    64.  Did your daughters have chores?  Oh, some. We still had a few chickens. Nothing like    We used to have  a baler and we used to have to go help do bales or stuff, or had to help  push stuff or something like that.  Yes, they never did have to run    I remember Julie, she was a little  more countrified than the rest of the other girls, I guess. She  would  run  the tractor a little bit.  She   d run the tractor. She was good at it. This is the one that became the  MD. (Laughs)  In fact, when I quit farming there five years ago, we had a farm sale and  sold all the equipment and stuff. Had an old Ford tractor there and  decided to sell it. It was going to sell, looked around, here is Julie. She  32  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  was bidding on the thing and bought it. I said,    What in the world you  want that for?       Well, that   s what I learned to drive. I just couldn   t see it  leave the farm.    (Laughter)  Couldn   t leave the family. (Laughs)  So, we got it out there at the farm. (Laughs)  Still use it a lot, mow the roadside and all.  Is someone living in the house now?  No, we haven   t done anything yet, since     We just moved in here March of this year.  Do you plan to do something, or you just don   t know yet?  I don   t know.  The girls don   t want us to sell it. (Laughs)  Like to do something there. I want to do something, I suppose. The girls,  they weren   t very happy. They thought we ought to keep that house.  (Laughs) That   s where they grew up and everything.  No one else should live there. (Laughs)  Then what prompted the move into town?  Well, just started getting old and better do something before too long.  (Laughs)  I always said if anything happened to him, I   d move to town because I  couldn   t keep up with the things around there that he helped with.  Is the land leased by someone now to do wheat?  Yes. Yes, I   ve got four quarters and an eighty     Lease it all to the same person.  I rent it out to the neighbor boys, they   re farmers. They started farming  part of it before we even quit farming, really.  Talk a little bit about the buildings that are on it now.  33  J. Gilmour  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Well, the house and one, two   in that picture there, there was about  three buildings, originally, built back about right after they built the  house, I understand. I mean, that   s before our time. I built two barns out  there now, since I   ve lived there. Other than that, everything else is still  original.  Is there a chicken coop? Is it still   ?  Yes, it   s still there. We have the chicken house.  Yes, the chicken house is still there.  The chicken house.  Fenced off, had to keep the dog in there once in a while.  Wash house, the wash house we called it, it   s still there. A couple of the  other barns.  An outhouse?  No, it   s gone. (Laughter) Well, the cement stool part of it   s still out  there.  Yes, it   s out there by the trashcans. WPA was around back then and built  one for them.  We had a four-by-four cement floor in there where the stool seat actually  was. It   s still out there. Never did get rid of that. But other than that, it   s  pretty much original.  Right next to where our satellite dish was. (Laughs)  We can go out and look at the buildings.  Talk a little bit about the conservation efforts on the Gilmour Farm.  Yes, I understood that according to Dad there, that was the first terraces  in Kingfisher County back in the late-   20s.  On the Gilmour Farm?  Yes. I guess they had to survey them off by hand. I guess they made  them with horses and stuff there. Way back there in the early-   20s, they  didn   t have any big tractors or anything, bulldozers to build them like  34  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  they do today. We   ve had them rebuilt some there now, but all three  places there have got terraces on them.  Did they do any ponds, build ponds as a part of that?  Yes. I don   t know, that pond at the home place there, it   s been there  when we was kids because we used to go down there and ice skate and  fish. (Laughs)  It was kind of natural-looking. Grass goes down to it. There   s a dam on  the end.  Got a picture of you and us and Robert and Arlene when we went  swimming. We used to go swimming. I didn   t think nothing about it. We  always went swimming in the ponds. (Laughs)  Over on the Willit   s pond, they even had a slide going into the water.  It   s gone now.  Yes, one place I had over there, not this old place, but we had a diving  board and a slipper slide on the pond dam. (Laughs)  When they closed down this school that he attended one year, all the  rural schools had a slipper slide and swing set. So, my dad got it. I don   t  know whether he bought it or they just said,    Move it.     Yes, we moved it, that slipper slide, on this pond dam.  He put it over on this  pond  and then built a spring board.  About every Saturday or Sunday in the summer, all the neighbor boys,  we   d all go swimming or fishing over there. (Laughter)  When you were swimming, was there parental supervision, or they just  trusted you to   ?  No.  We were old enough by then to     Yes, teenagers, I guess. Yes, we never had any folks there with us or  anything.  What were holidays like in that house, in your childhood?  We always had a pretty big Thanksgiving and Christmas, didn   t we?  35  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Yes, Thanksgiving, Mother had a niece that had twelve children, lived  over at Watonga. Mother would have all of the Cross relatives that were  in the county, next door, or whatever. So, we had a full house for  Thanksgiving because there wasn   t hardly any in Gilmours, just the  three. There were three   four. Aunt Mary might have even been in the  service. But anyway, big family Thanksgivings. Christmas was more or  less just our family.  Yes, pretty much.  But Dad would go   we had the conservation shelter belts after the Dust  Bowl days, what, a mile and a half away?  Yes.  Dad would go cut the top, supposedly, out of one of the cedar trees.  Well, when you   re out in the wide open, they don   t look so big. But  when you get them closer to putting them in the house, they grow. He  would kind of   he was six-feet-two. He would put his hand out like this  and try to measure it. (Gestures) But it still, when it got in the house  sometimes, had to be trimmed down a little bit. (Laughs) But we always  had native cedar trees and lots and lots of decorations on it.  Native Christmas trees.  For Christmas, yes.  Gifts weren   t too plentiful because we didn   t want things.  You didn   t have stuff like you do today.  No.  Didn   t get it if you didn   t need it.  We  kids  farmed. Under our big elm tree in our backyard for shade, we  took nails, put them in the ground, took string, made the fence. Like I  said, our dad was pretty handy and he built things from wood, and then  the boys learned to do those things. So, we had all kinds of little houses,  barns, whatever.  Made that stuff, yes.  And went out and played in the dirt, so to speak. I did, too, because the  closest girl to me was two and a half miles, I think.  36  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Yes, about two and a half miles.  I was a tomboy. (Laughter) I still am. You see this haircut? I just got it  cut yesterday. (Laughs)  Did you have a favorite meal? What would it be?  Oh, fried chicken.  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, maybe.  Fried chicken.  Yes, fried chicken was our main dish all the time at home. (Laughs)  Yes, and Mother was excellent at angel food cake because she had all  the eggs.  Yes, made a lot of angel food cake.  A lot of angel food cakes and of course, fruit cobblers from the canned  peaches and apricots.  Peach trees, peaches. Yes, we had a lot of peach stuff, like that.  Berries, she had berry vines. We had a lot of berry, fruit things like that.  Cows to milk?  Yes, we never did milk big. We   d just milk one or two cows, is about all  we ever milked, as far as milk.  We usually had one.  Whose chore was that to do?  Well, our dad. He did most of it.  Yes, he did most of it.  I never did milk much. A little bit, but not a whole lot. He did most the  milking. Other than that, we never did raise hogs, either. He didn   t like  hogs, I guess. (Laughs) Chicken and sheep.  Sheep, chicken and sheep.  37  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Chicken and sheep was our main livestock, cows. Had cattle.  And the sheep you would shear and then sell the wool?  Yes. They sheared sheep every spring. We never did actually do much  of it ourselves, but they had a couple guys around here in the county that  did that basically, for a living I guess.  From place to place.  Yes, I think so.  Because in the spring, they   d shear our sheep and the neighbors and  everybody else   s. It was quite a few sheep herds in the county. They   d  just make their rounds.  And then they would take it away. You wouldn   t have to worry about  taking it to market, then?  Well, yes, we had to do that. They had a big ole special sacks that were  about six foot long and about three foot in diameter. In fact, I   ve still got  it out at home. My dad made a little box thing. When you got your sheep  sheared, you put it in this box. And then you had a certain kind of string,  you laid it across the box in four ways, and you tied it. Then you had a  bundle of wool, and you put it in the sack, then. You got a sack full, big  ole sacks was about, like I say, about six foot long and about three foot  in diameter. You filled them up, and then they had a deal here in  Kingfisher where they used to pick it up down here at the railroad.  Yes, shipped it back east or somewhere.  Then it got to where I think we had to take it to   I don   t know where we  took that last, there.  Took it to Enid, didn   t we?  We went to Enid with it, it seems like. An outfit bought it up there. Yes,  we   d have three or four sacks of wool, I guess. We   d shear about fifty  head in those big sacks and ship it. (Laughs) That was the main spring  operation, I guess.  You asked about 4-H. I married a Mr. Hopkins from southeast of  Kingfisher. His parents were farmers, and he became an educator. He  said he didn   t want any more of that. He had to start driving a tractor  during World War II because all the men left the farms. I think he started  38  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Finchum  driving a tractor full-time in the day when he was about eight-years-old,  and his dad would drive at night. He was an only child. But anyway, we  have three sons, and since they had access to farm facilities, they all  three were in 4-H and raised Angus steers mostly is what they did. Once  in a while, they had some chickens. They had one that laid a different  color of eggs. Araucanas, I don   t know if you   re familiar with that?  I   ve heard the term, but     Because, there again, the farm had chickens, and they decided to try  something a little fancier than just layers.  Did they go to 4-H Roundup in Stillwater?  Oh, yes, went to Roundup. One of them went to Nationals in  Washington, D.C., or wherever that was. I think just one of them went to  that, but they were pretty active. They never did go FFA when they got  into high school. They had music and sports.  Did your mother belong to a homemaker club?  Oh, yes. She was one of the originals of that, I   m sure.  Yes.  Very active in the home extension and made shirts for the boys and all  my clothes.  Yes, we had a lot of homemade shirts. (Laughs)  Our  fairs  used to be so nice when everybody competed. There were   twenty-two  clubs in this county. You   d have to have like twelve or  twenty items to compete in every club. It was a big thing. Now, it is not  used as much.  Yes.  Did she quilt?  Not much. She was a seamstress, not so much of a quilter.  She could look at a picture and make a dress that looked like that  picture. She was very talented in sewing.  Those skills have gone, haven   t they?  39  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Yes.  I think so. I think so. No, farm life, because she did have some egg-gathering  chores when the guys would be in the field and stuff   and I  did that, too   but sewing was her main activity with the sewing  machine, rather than hand-quilting.  And music, she could play the piano. She   d play   you name a song, she  could play it.  That would lead then to ask what did you do for fun. Since you had all  these chores and work, what did you do for fun?  I don   t know, all the boys around here, we all hunted and fished a little  was about our main thing, I guess, is what we used to do. Duck hunting  and stuff like that. In fact, they used to have a coyote roundup club here  in Kingfisher. Boy, these guys were from Loyal, there was two or three  groups of them. They had the coyote hounds. They had a regular coyote  hunting deal there in the fall, called it Coyote Roundup Club, there.  They   d go out, and the coyotes was pretty thick. The guys didn   t like  them. They   d go out on like a section of land. They   d take a truck and  the guys would all get in the truck, and then they   d walk through the  section, scare the coyotes out. The boys had these coyote hounds.  They   d be on the other side of the section. When the coyotes come out,  they turn the dog loose and catch them. Yes, they did that for quite a  while there.  A lot of trucks are coyote hunters  with a dog  box on the back.  They   d meet down here at the old armory later in the fall, and they   d  have a barbeque dinner and everything else down there for everybody  that hunted coyotes. (Laughs) Quite an operation, there.  We need them now. The coyotes are bad.  Yes, they   ve been real bad here this last year or two, there.  We lost all our dogs to coyotes before we moved to town.  Yes, just the only food out there. We only know one or two guys that   s  got any coyote hounds to hunt coyotes anymore around here. That   s all  there is anymore. But like I say, I guess the coyotes there, the guys they  send in, I don   t know, through the     They used to pay them a little bit, wouldn   t they, for a skin or   ?  40  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  The ears, I think.     or the ears, yes. They   d take in and they   d pay them so much.  Cut the ears off and the state paid a little bit.  Yes, they used to pay about a dollar or something like that. They   d let  them, through the county, some kind of county deal. You caught a  coyote there, you   d take the ears in, get a dollar or two for them. Last  year, I don   t know if the organization there     I don   t know who it was brought that plane.  They brought in a plane here. Gosh, I know out northwest of here last  winter, they shot thirty-seven coyotes in one day out there. They were  killing calves and everything else.  They could   ve done it some more, but they didn   t have enough fuel to  do it two days. (Laughs)  But you asked what we did for fun. Hunting was kind of his outlet, I   m  sure. I learned to sew. I did that and enjoyed that. And just walking  around the farm and playing in the dirt, like I said. We had little ole farm  implements, of course, and did that.  Toys, yes.  A tire swing on the tree?  No.  No, we had a different one.  I don   t if we ever really had a tire.  We had an actual swing set probably built out of pipe or something, and  I have nice memories.  Yes, is it your finger? (Laughs)  He was pulling the old push lawn mower, and he of course, was older.  He flipped the blades to get it turning, and I was about three. I put my  hand up there and     Cut her finger off. (Laughs)  41  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Cut the end of my finger off. (Laughter)  That wasn   t a fun day. (Laughter)  And then Mom always told the story about him, of course, that was  probably in probably    39 and had some old   well, it wasn   t probably  old at that time   vehicle. He   d be looking over the back seat and he   d  say,    We   re going thirty. We   re going thirty-five. We   re going forty   We   re going forty-five     (Laughter) Dad was trying to hurry to get me to  the doctor. (Laughter)  Yes, that old Dodge car, wasn   t it?  Probably.  1936 model, I think.  Probably was a new car that year, did everything that year. New tractor,  new car, must   ve had a good crop that year. (Laughter)  I guess so. Yes, our folks had that new Dodge, 1936, I think it was.  They did pretty good there in the Dust Bowl, then, or Depression years,  if they had a new car.  Yes, back in the Dust Bowl days in the early-   30s, there, real bad, there.  It was pretty bad in the early-   50s.  Yes.  Because I remember when I got out of the navy in    53 and came home,  there, that farm, there, the pasture north of the house, it blowed out of  the field probably that deep, for ten or fifteen feet. (Gestures) The sand  off the field, there, 1953 or    52.  Up to    53, because when you all got married it was so hot. When we got  married in    54 it was so hot, but while both of the boys were in the navy  it was so dry.  Yes, dust storm.  The dirt and sand would blow up. Here   s your fence post, halfway up  that. (Gestures) The grasshoppers would be solid on the back side     Shade of the fence.  42  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum     shade of the fence post because the    50s were dry, too. Of course, I  wasn   t there in the early Dust Bowl days, so I don   t know how it  compares. But it was pretty bleak there in the early    50s.  The day we got married it was 105. (Laughs)  Yes.  There wasn   t  any  air conditioning. (Laughter)  What year was that?     53. Yes, it was real hot there.  He was still in the service. He had six months left to serve, but his ship  was going to be in dry dock in Boston so we got married and lived up  there for six months. It   s educational, too, to live in Boston. (Laughter)  From here, quite a change.  Yes, it was a change in Boston. (Laughs)  Any listening to baseball games and that sort of thing as entertainment?  Yes.  They had a radio. He listened to the radio a lot.  Oh, you said playing baseball?  No, listening to it.  Listening to it. Oh, okay.  In your younger days.  No, our dad did that for us. (Laughs)  Yes, he listened to all the ballgames on the old radio there all the time.  Oh, yes.  Sportsman.  Get right up against the radio there and listen to ballgames.  Did they go to church?  43  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Yes, First United Methodist here in Kingfisher.  Yes.  So, once the service was over, on a typical Sunday afternoon in your  teenage years, let   s say     I don   t know, can   t remember doing much.  Fried chicken for lunch?  Probably went home and had fried chicken for lunch.  Probably. (Laughs)  Came back in for youth meetings. Might have gone to the movie after  that.  Kingfisher had a theater?  Yes, had two of them.  It had two.  I think the neighbor boys and us, we   d get together and go swimming in  the pond on Sunday afternoon. (Laughs)  Yes, always some boys swimming.  Any home remedies? Like if you got stung by a bee, what would you do,  type of things?  I don   t remember being stung by a bee, but I suppose I did.  Put soda on it. (Laughs) I remember that.  I don   t remember any particular   iodine, we lived by iodine, I think.  Yes, iodine and mercurochrome.  Other than that, there wasn   t too much excitement.  In the World War II years, you were your own doctor. You didn   t have  any   you didn   t go to the doctor.  44  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Yes, we didn   t go to the doctor in Kingfisher because they were all gone.  They were all in the service.  How else has Kingfisher changed, then, from your teenage years to  now? If it had two theaters, it doesn   t have any now, I don   t think, does  it?  We have one, now, because one of the theaters, of course, had been  closed. The other one burned about six years ago?  Something like that, yes.  Something like that one night, just horrible, horrible. And some of the  leaders of the community put some money together and others  contributed, and we have a real  theater . What do they have; three or  four little theaters in there?  Three, three movies that you can see in the evening.  Three different movies.  Only county  town  around that even still has a theater.  There was a drive-in theater out south of town for quite a little while.  Yes, we did that some, too. As teenagers, we did that.  Yes, drive-in movies.  Dance halls?  We tried Teen Towns a time or two, but they didn   t seem to last very  long. We had a roller rink at one time. Well, the roller rink when we  were kids was at the old armory. That   s where it was. Dover had one.  We   d go up there some. But there was an actual roller skating rink for  our children, but we don   t have that now. There   s nothing in Kingfisher  to do, except go to the movie.  Skate park.  Yes, that   s about it.  Now we   ve got the skate park.  Little skate park downtown. I don   t think it gets much use.  45  Hopkins  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  No, it doesn   t.  I   m not sure if I asked this, but how did your parents meet? Do you  know?  Your mom and dad, I don   t know.  I don   t ever remember anything, really.  They lived in the same community.  How close are the farms, then, is the Cross Farm to the Gilmour Farm?  It was about four miles, three and a half, four miles between farms.  Probably through friends more than anything because they   d get a buggy  and a horse and take a little spin in the country. I know Mom mentioned  that they went swimming in the Cimarron River. Now, I don   t think Dad  particularly haunted that area, but    (Laughs)  Yes, I heard them talking about swimming, kids swimming in the  Cimarron River, up there from south of Dover.  Couldn   t swim too much today, though, could they?  No, you can hardly wade in it.  It wouldn   t be ankle deep, now. No water in it, hardly. (Laughs)  Would they have gone to school together?  No.  No.  No, he actually went to Catholic school here in Kingfisher.  Yes, our dad, he went to Catholic school here.  Where the mother went to this Gant School where she taught.  Then maybe church.  I don   t know how they actually ever met there, really.  46  Nykolaiszyn  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Nykolaiszyn  Hopkins  Nykolaiszyn  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gilmour  Nykolaiszyn  Hopkins  Nykolaiszyn  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Were you raised Catholic?  No.  Oh, no.  No.  No, he was not raised a Catholic, either.  He just went to Catholic school?  Right.  I was just curious because back then, that usually wasn   t an accepted     it was kind of hard if you were Catholic.  Well, usually, the Catholics kids would ride the school bus to the public  school, ride into town on the school bus and then somebody raised a fuss  about that and they had to quit it. So, parents had to take them if they  went to Catholic school. But  at  one time, they did ride the school buses  together.  Before they had school buses here, the neighbors there were Catholic.  We rode to school. They   d take us to public school, and then they   d drop  their kids off at Catholic school. Same way, pick them up in the evening  or something. They   d pick us up at public school and go by and pick  them up at Catholic school, come home. Yes, because     People worked together.  How   d you meet your wife?  What was that?  How   d you meet your wife?     Oh, it   s been too long ago. I can   t remember     (Laughter)  Talk about putting you on the spot   Whew, yes, with her sitting here  (Laughter)  He had a friend that was dating a girl from Dover, and she asked me if I  wanted a double date, and Jim was a double date.  47  J. Gilmour  Nykolaiszyn  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Yes, I guess that   s right.  Good save.  It was a long time ago. (Laughter)  I know the    80s was a tough time, too, for farmers in this area. Did you  struggle during that time period, in the    80s?  It wasn   t too bad, I don   t think.  Not too many years where we didn   t have a crop, not many. Some years  it wasn   t great but, you know, you survived. (Laughs)  Only one   when was that they had the big hail storm up there east of  Loyal?  Oh, I remember that.  Yes, they had a pretty bad hail storm there one year in about    50.  Lost every window on the north side of the house, I know that.  So, weather was always the     Yes, whether you got good rains or not. You couldn   t control weather.  Yes,    57 had the big flood. We got flooded when we lived there east of  Loyal, Cooper Creek there. In    57 there, it flooded real bad there and  then Dover had that terrible   her folks, their water got  into the house .  I had to fly out to get back to Kingfisher because all the bridges were  gone   not the bridge itself, but the entryway to it. The road up to it, you  couldn   t get through for a long while.  In    57, there, yes. That   s when I was with my folks there. We lived there  east of Loyal on the creek there     I drove to Hennessey and left the kids at my mother   s at Dover and then  couldn   t get home, got back to Dover, and then I was flooded for   I was  in there, what, three or four days before they had a crop duster that came  in and landed on the highway and took us back to Kingfisher. (Laughs) I  remember they brought us back to the airport in Kingfisher.  Yes, all the bridges on the Cimarron River were washed out there for  several days. South of Dover, 81 Highway, that was the main bridge. It  48  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  was washed out there for quite a while, west of Dover, it washed out.  All that summer, we   d go to see my folks, we   d drive to the bridge and  then climb down a ladder, and somebody would pick us up on the other  side or meet us. We   d call them to come meet us to go back home the  same way because it was a while before they got the roadway up to     Well, I was a substitute mail carrier out of Dover for fifteen years. I was  reading how that got started there. We was on the Dover route west of  Dover there, and then the mail carrier, he couldn   t   all the bridges were  washed out, so he contacted me. He   d come south of Dover there and  climb up the ladder on the river bridge. Then I   d meet him over there,  and we   d go out west of Dover, out there about three miles east of Loyal  is far as our route went. Then it went north around there, and then I   d  bring him back to the river bridge there. He   d climb down the ladder and  go do his route. Well, they needed a substitute mail carrier so I started as  substitute mail carrier for them after they got the road fixed, there.  Carried the mail out west of Dover, there, then go back east of Dover,  south, and northeast of Dover. Did that until    73, I think it was.  Yes,    73 or    74.  I think that   s when they was going to consolidate Dover with Loyal and  I wasn   t going to get home until     Make a really long route.     late in the afternoon before I could get home. I was farming about  seven or eight quarters, then, so    (Laughs)  You needed daylight hours.  So, I couldn   t carry mail any longer. I gave that up.  How has recordkeeping changed from your father   s time to your time?  Oh, quite a bit I guess you   d say. (Laughter) Back then, I don   t know  whether they kept a record of much.  Dad kept a daily record of eggs  produced daily and the price when sold. He also recorded the weather,  large purchases and the birth of his three children.   It was a cash crop-type thing. Of course, they did sell wheat, and I really  don   t know too much about that. But the eggs at the grocery store, that  was the main place you needed it. My dad would bring the eggs in, the  guy would write out how many dozen it was. So, for thirty days, Mom  charged groceries, you might say, and they owed Dad for eggs. So, at the  49  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Nykolaiszyn  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  end of the month or whenever they could, who owed who, they paid the  difference. That   s the way the groceries were paid for, like that. When  Mom moved with us in    83, of course, she had these old records. They  never had more than two hundred dollars in the bank. You just   they  didn   t need money. I suppose if he wanted to buy a new car or tractor, he  sold wheat. Had nice storage, grain storages in these barns that are still  there and kept a lot of wheat in there. Of course, fed wheat to the  chickens.  When wheat price would come up we   d haul a little wheat to town and  sell it.  Yes, sell it, and that wouldn   t be big money, but it was just amazing to  me to look through her check bank statements and two hundred dollars  about was the highest there ever was in there.  Found old tickets there of when he was farming and threshing  everywhere. He bought, what, forty or fifty gallons of gas down here,  tractor gas, for four dollars or something like that. (Laughter) It was  seven or eight cents a gallon. It wasn   t hardly nothing.  What would it cost today? I don   t have any idea.  Oh, gosh. Well, just like the   I don   t know. They knock off a little, I  guess, for farm fuel. Of course, I hadn   t had to buy anything, either, for a  long time. But regular gas is three dollars     Almost four, now.  Close to four dollars.     and eighty-one cents here, I see in town here now. So, if you had to  pay that for your farm   farm fuel is a little bit cheaper than that. I don   t  know what   I haven   t bought any for quite a while, actual farm gas or  anything.  Would they stash money somewhere in the house? Would they have a  secret hiding spot?  Our folks didn   t, to my knowledge. But my mother-in-law did. They had  chickens and sold eggs, and I guess that was    her    money. She kept it in  a jar, buried in the ground. (Laughter)  Kept it buried. (Laughs)  Yes.  50  Finchum  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Well, when the oil well came in view, do you remember when that  happened with your folks?  That first well came in, it was about    81 wasn   t it? That Shannon well     Well, we had a well there     At home.     drilled in about 19   let   s see.  We were still in Oregon when that one on the Hague place was first  done.  We had a well there, just right out west of the buildings there, out on that  home place, there on the Gilmour Farm there. Drilled that in    60   early-     60s is when they come in here. They drilled a whole bunch of them out  in there, that some company there. They drilled a well right in there. At  one time they had right along that road there where we lived there, they  was drilling six wells at one time. It looked like a town at night almost,  everywhere rigs were lit up there. They didn   t pay much for   leases  weren   t nothing back there.  They didn   t pay anything for leases, not like they do now.  I was just curious if that cash flow helped much, if you noticed a  difference.  Oh, sure.  Oh, yes.  It always helps, but then you don   t plan on it because tomorrow you may  not get anything.  Yes, you never knew how long they was going to keep those wells. That  well there, on our home place there, Gilmour, we had two wells there at  one time. They took both and they   re all gone, now. They never did pay  a lot.  But you kept mineral rights to both?  Yes, we   ve still got the mineral rights on the farms, there. We have one  place there, we   ve got one well there on that northwest quarter from the  house there. We   ve still got a well there. Doesn   t amount to hardly  51  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P.

There  was two wells there at one time. One of them never did amount to  nothing. This one well we got, they drilled that in, I think, 1980.  Yes, 1980.  It was a good well to start out with, really.  They named it after one of the investors so nobody knew it was their  well, which was nice because they call it the Shannon well. (Laughs)  They usually name them after whoever owns the property.  They sold that off here a few years ago. It   s been kind of a mess. Since  then, we hadn   t had much income from it.  You just had to learn to farm around it?  Well, yes, the ones that have the farm ground, yes. Yes, they just lay it  off with maybe a half-acre, acre. Of course, you had a lease road going  in there. They paid a little damages when they started those wells.  Usually, they paid a little something there. Back then, they didn   t pay  you much. I guess they pay pretty good, now, on some of these. Of  course, they   re drilling some of these slant wells and those guys are  getting big money for that. They hadn   t drilled any right close to  Kingfisher here. They   ve been all the way out in the southwest part of  the county.  Blaine County.  Yes, big wells.  You go out to Watonga, in there, now they   ve really got some big wells.  Some of those guys have really got a lot of money out of those. (Laughs)  Right around here, they hadn   t drilled any of those slant wells here at all.  Nothing around here.  I understand they   re going to be drilling some, but they haven   t yet,  these slant wells.  Chesapeake   s leased about everything in the county. (Laughs)  Has the way you   ve raised and farmed wheat changed much during the  time you started and stopped?  Oh, yes. Quite a bit from back there in the early-   50s, yes. It makes a lot  52  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Hopkins  of difference. Of course, wheat was   I think when I first started  farming, maybe a dollar and twenty or thirty cents, something like that, a  bushel. That   s all it was back there in the early-   50s. Of course, it   s got  up now to eight dollars and something now, eight and a half.  Of course, you tend to put it in the ground, though.  Yes.  Of course, the expenses got so much higher, too, since then.  Your machinery is high.  From a small tractor to a combine?  Oh, yes, a combine is three hundred and something-odd thousand dollars  for a combine now. The tractors are  250,000.  Wouldn   t want to pay that money again. (Laughs)  That   s why, quote,    the younger men don   t go into farming,    unless they  can inherit the equipment.  Yes, it costs so much to try to start.  Which there isn   t very many of them can do that.  If you don   t inherit it, forget it. You   re not going to make a go of it.  Yes.  A young guy can   t hardly start out farming on his own.  No, there   d be no way.  They got to have the folks help them out for quite a while to get started.  What do you see for the next one hundred years for the Gilmour Farm?  What do you plan for it?  That   s hard to say. I don   t know. (Laughs)  Hard to say when you   re eighty what you   re going to do in the next one  hundred years. (Laughs)  You asked about how things had changed in keeping records.  Like Jim  53  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  Finchum  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  P. Gilmour  Nykolaiszyn  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  said  Dad did a daily journal, and he wrote down the weather, the  moisture if there was any, if he sold eggs or gathered. He kept everyday  how many were gathered, not just sold.  Yes, I got those books in there.  You   ve got the book in there. But he did a daily journal of, I suppose if a  new calf was born or things like that. He had it all written down. But a  dollar value, probably not, as far as we do entering on the computer. But  it   s all there. It   s very interesting to look back through and talk about the  price of   they raised a little corn, but very little. That wasn   t a  cash  crop    just probably more for chicken feed or something like that.  Yes, it   s 99 percent wheat.  Yes, that was it. But all the wheat prices, he has all those listed. It   s very  interesting to read through that.  Do you take your wheat to Kingfisher?  Yes. When we lived out there on the creek east of Loyal, we   d haul a  little bit to Loyal. But most of it came to Kingfisher.  That was my only farm job once a year, to drive the truck for him when  he combined. (Laughter) Lots of fun. (Laughs)  Official truck driver.  No air conditioning. Drive slow. (Laughs)  Straight shift?  Yes.  Do you hope that the land stays in the family as you look towards the  next couple years?  Oh, yes. As long as we   re alive it won   t change any. I don   t know if the  girls, they may want to sell it off eventually.  All our girls have other professions. They didn   t want to be in farming.  Probably the same out in your husband   s land. I don   t know what they   ll  do with that.  Well, that   s already predetermined since that   s why   they acquired a  54  Finchum  P. Gilmour  Finchum  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J.

Gilmour  third property so that each of our three sons will have a quarter-section.  Now, what they do with it, who knows. One of them will keep it because  he has a vineyard and a winery on just a portion of it. Of course, the land  is rented out, leased out, too. He   ll get that farm so he can keep his  retirement project going.  Well, the Gilmour is at 160-plus, or is it just now 160 acres?  What we own, you mean?  What you own, yes.  Oh, no.  It   s more? So, at least keep the 160 together?  Oh, yes.  More than likely, somebody will keep that going, I would think.  Yes.  We own four quarters and an eighty.  The original Gilmour is the 160, but they have purchased other  properties along.  Hard to tell what the girls want to do. (Laughs)  Maybe their children will     Well, the one that bought the tractor may     May have plans to     Yes, she may. (Laughs)  She   s an OB/GYN, she   s a little busy right now. (Laughs) I don   t think  she   ll be back to farming, but they miss it.  So now that you   re living in town, do you miss the farm?  Oh, I go out there every day. (Laughter)  We have one dog out there.  55  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  Hopkins  J. Gilmour  P. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  J. Gilmour  Finchum  Hopkins  Still got a dog out there, yet.  He has to go out and feed the dog every morning.  I was out there this morning already.  When you lived in the country, he was in town every day. Now, it   s  reversed.  Yes, when we lived out there I used to have to come to town and drink  coffee with my boys down here at one of the grain elevators. Now, it   s  only about a half-mile down here. I can be down there in five minutes,  now. Go down there every morning and meet with the boys.  Catch up on the farm news. Some of them still have farming interests,  too, don   t they?  Oh, yes. Most of them still farming.  The last city manager used to always come down and drink coffee with  them because he said,    Nobody here is going to complain to me about  what   s going on in town.    (Laughs)  Anything else you want to add before we close off?  Oh, I don   t know. I guess it   s pretty well covered most everything as far  as the farming goes.  You wouldn   t change it.  I don   t know of anything else.  Farming was a good life?  Yes, it   s been all right. (Laughs)  Well, if there   s nothing else, we   ll say thank you very much for sharing  your stories with us today. It   s been great.  Appreciate you doing this project.  -------  -------
