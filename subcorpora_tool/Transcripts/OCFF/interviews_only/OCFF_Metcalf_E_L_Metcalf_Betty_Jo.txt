 Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  Today is July 30, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Juliana  Nykolaiszyn, and we are in Jet, Oklahoma, today to speak with E. L. and  Betty Jo Metcalf. This is part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm Project,  so thank you for having us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start with learning how the family came to have this piece of  property to begin with.  My grandmother, which was Mary Metcalf, homesteaded this place. She  didn   t make the  land  run. My dad was probably just a little bit too  young, but she had two older boys that were old enough to stake. One of  them staked on this northwest quarter of the section across the road, and  the other one staked in the northwest quarter of this section. She did not  make the run, but she homesteaded the place. She came down, I think  about six, eight weeks after the run. Evidently these older sons made  some kind of arrangement with somebody who staked this place. They  either bought it or traded for it. I don   t know for sure what happened  there, but we do know that she homesteaded it. We have that original  homestead certificate. We   ll show you that if you want to see it. We  have from national archives all the things she had to do, to prove up, that  she homesteaded this place. My dad, he ended up with it. I think he  bought it from her.  I found out later from records in the Alfalfa County  Courthouse that Mary deeded the land to Emery.   Okay.  That   s the way I   ve always heard the story.  Her name was Mary?  5  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Mary Metcalf.  Was she married?  She was a widow and had been widowed twice. She was fifty-seven  years old before she did this.  Came from where?  Kansas. Partridge, Kansas. It   s a little ol    town. I don   t know if there   s  even anything left there or not, but it   s more or less (I   m guessing here)  about probably 100-120 miles mostly straight north of here.  And was that where she was from originally?  Well, no, she was originally born in Indiana.  Just kept coming south.  Yes, there   s a lot of Metcalfs around Partridge, Kansas, in the cemetery  there. That   s where they were living when the run happened here.  Do you know why they chose this particular spot?  No, I don   t know.  So it came from her to your father.  Yes, she came down and moved over here with him.  I think my dad was about fifteen years old. I know he lived in a dugout  with her. They lived in a dugout that first year. Of course, that was in  September when they run, and according to national archives they built a  house in 1894. We still have the house that   s right out here. That   s how  she got here.  And then when   did he take over running it at a particular time, your  father?  Well, yes, sometime in his life, and I don   t know when. Like I said, I  think he bought it from her, probably. I think that   s what happened.  Before he was married or after?  Before. (Laughs)  6  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  When he was fifteen is when he came down here to live with her on this  homestead that she had.  I know she homesteaded it.  Well, then how   d your dad meet your mother?  Well, my mother was from Missouri, and the original Timberlake  schoolhouse was right down there just half a mile west, Timberlake  district number sixty-nine. She came down here to teach that school. She  graduated from Walnut Grove, Missouri, as the salutatorian. You could  teach then, these country schools, with just a high school graduation. I   m  sure that   s how they met.  Do you know where she lived when she first came?  No, I don   t know. I   m guessing, though, with some neighbor because  that   s the way they did in those little country schools.  So when did they get married, then?  We got the date, but I don   t know. In some of our information, we have  it.  I   ve got all of that stuff. I don   t know how to get it for you. I mean, I   ve  got it ready for you, but it   s in the other room.  That   s okay.  One thing that   s really interesting to me, when the state of Oklahoma  had its centennial, they started publishing little blurbs in the papers,  wanting to look for centennial farms. They had a telephone number, and  I called, and I said,    I   m living on a centennial farm.    They say,    Well,  you got to prove it.    I said,    How do I do that?    They gave me the  address of the national archives in Washington DC, and they sent us  back about eight pages of legal-size papers, tells all about what she had  to do to prove, (they call that    proving up   ) like publishing it in the  paper. Like there in that paper they sent us, they say like most things  they did,    we built some fence, we broke out some more grass, we built  a house,    gave a description of it, fourteen by twenty. They had to do  that for ten years. You already know that I guess.  It varies from place to place.  Does it?  7  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  So ten years?  Yes, ten years, then they issued that homestead certificate. That was  signed by Teddy Roosevelt   s secretary, but has got    Teddy Roosevelt by  secretary   . We have that. I have that.  And that would   ve been before statehood, then.  Yes, that would   ve been in 18   well, I think it was 1902 because if you  count    83 and then a year or two, that figures out to ten years.  What were some of the crops or produce things that they     Well, you know, I don   t know. Wheat was the thing, the big thing. I  know they tried corn, but it didn   t work. Cattle, of course, that was a big  thing. Wheat and cattle.  Did they add any ponds to the farm?  Not here, no. There   s buffalo wallows out there. There was a pasture out  east of the house, probably about thirty acres, and there were four  buffalo wallows in that, that I used to get stuck in (Laughs) that over  long period of time they filled up. If you know where to look, I can still  recognize the biggest one out there. It, and prairie dogs out there.  And what year were you born?  Nineteen twenty-six.  Were you born in this house?  This house, sleep in the bedroom I was born in. (Laughs)  That   s pretty   did you have brothers and sisters?  Yes, I have four brothers and one sister.  How did you end up getting the property?  Dad had several quarters, quite a few quarters. He made the will, and I  don   t know why. I was just a kid. He died when I was just a very young  man.  His name   s the same as his.  8  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  Yes.  Emery Lemuel Metcalf Jr. is what his name is, really.  So I don   t know.  Were you the first son?  I was the last one.  Last one, okay.  Then a sister born later.  Were they interested in farming, your siblings?  Oh yes, yes, they was all farmers. Three of my older brothers have gone  now, and I have a brother just older than I am, still alive, and a sister just  younger than I am, still alive.  Well, tell us about this house when you were a youngster.  The way I remember this house is just like it is right now except we built  on what we call the den out here, but the rest of it is, as far as the  structure   s concerned, just like it always was. The lighting on the house,  I can remember that we had what they called carbide lighting. It   s a  settling gas, carbine and water. Carbine, I guess it is. I don   t know for  sure how you pronounce it. Anyhow, that and water mixed makes a  settling gas  acetylene . We had fixtures hanging out of the ceiling that  looked quite a bit like that with an open flame, if you can imagine that.  Pipes through the ceiling and coming in. Then we had the coal oil lamps,  and then in the late 1930s, the rural electrification came in. Well, before  that, even.  Dad put in what they called a Delco thirty-two volt electric system. It   s a  generator, just like a generator. It sat out here in the old house. It wasn   t  a house then, of course, being used. Mother had, as far as I can  remember now, she had a refrigerator, an iron, and a toaster, and that  was it, as far as electricity. Then when the REC  Rural Electric  Cooperative  come in, or rural electric, I guess, then a lot more  appliances and lights and stuff like that. It   s had lanterns and carbide and  the thirty-two volt and now the rural. Had four different lighting systems  in this house that I can remember. I   m sure that   s all of them probably.  And how was it heated?  9  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  We had coal stoves and wooden stoves and a chimney coming out the  top, of course. Mostly, I can remember is mostly coal.  Did it stay warm in your bedroom?  No. (Laughs) Mother would heat bricks up, just these red building  bricks, wrap them in paper, and we   d take those to bed with us. When it  was really, really cold, put them at our feet. (Laughs)  In fact, after we were even married, our kids can remember real plain,  we   d take a glass of water to bed, and it   d be ice in the morning. That  was our children, even, so that   s how cold it was.  We never had heating upstairs.  Until now. (Laughs)  Well, we put a stove in the hallway. Remember, Betty?  Yes, we did.  So you got dressed really quick in the mornings.  Yes, we did. (Laughter)  Did you have to share a room?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I had with an older brother, bedroom with him.  And the bathroom was outside, probably?  No. Well, we had one like that, too.  For a long time, yes.  Originally, the bathroom was upstairs.  No, it was outside.  Well, yes.  That was a long time.  But as more kids come along, the house has been built onto twice, the  back porch, what we call, and utility room and the bathroom. When they  moved the bathroom downstairs (which I don   t remember that; that was  10  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  before my time) because they needed a bedroom, so they built this one  and put the bathroom down here. We had a stove, heating stove. It was  here. I can just barely, barely remember that Mother   s cook stove was, it  was coal or wood. I think it was wood. You   ve seen these old fashioned  ones that have the lids on top and had a little water reservoir for hot  water. You   d pull that lid open for the oven. I just barely can remember  that. It sat right here in the corner of the kitchen. Then Mother had a coal  oil stove. They burned kerosene and coal oil for her cook stove. That   s  what I can remember about how it was early on there in my memory  before. I was almost last one along, so, you know     What were some of the things she would cook on that cook stove that you  remember?  You know, I don   t really remember. On that stove, I don   t think she had  it but maybe just a year or two along, in my memory. She had something  different, something better.  What were some of the favorite things she fixed for you, though?  I always say I was raised on mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans  and fried chicken (Laughs) because that   s what a lot of people had. Easy  to raise chickens, and had a garden and that sort of thing.  She do a lot of canning?  Yes, she did some canning and how she had   I get to thinking about  Mother, eight people here, living, and the cooking and the cleaning and  the laundry and all that. Lot   s of people did it.  Tell them where she did her washing.  My memory is of the house. Mother had it for her wash house. She had a  stove out there to heat the water. It was a little stove with   you   ve seen  these big black kettles     Yes.     sitting on top. Us kids would pump the water out of the cisterns. She  wanted that rainwater, soft water. Fill that up for her hot water to wash  with. I can remember rendering lard in it.  That   s out here in the house that they first made, and then they had this  stove in the middle with this great big kettle. That   s where they made  their soap.  11  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Lye soap?  Yes.  Yes.  Then she   d do her washing out here.  I still have that old kettle. Well, I don   t really. I give it to our youngest  daughter.  She made a flower garden out of it.  And then hang it on the line? Hang all the clothes on the line?  Oh, yes, right. (Laughs) We used to have a telephone that hung on the  wall, and, of course, it was a party line, however many was on your  party. You could listen in. (Laughs)  Do you remember your rings, how many     Oh, yes, it was  two longs .  There you go.  RF-55 was our number.  I   ve got four of the different phones that we have used upstairs. I   ll show  it to you if you want to go up.  Things have really changed amazingly.  What were some of your chores as a child, youngster?  Oh, yes, I never did milk any cows. There were cows milked, but Dad  gave it up. I just milked the cow when Betty and I was first married, for  a few years for just our home use, just one cow. We never were into  milking, to speak of. Dad was a wheat farmer, cattle. That   s just what  this country was. You could just say that this country   s wheat and cattle  until the last few years. They   ve come up with different crops, but just  wheat and cattle country.  What do you remember about your first tractor experience?  Well, my first experience, really, I don   t know how old I was before I  first went in the field, but I can remember staying home and helping  12  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Mother do some things because of all her work load. I probably was  about fifteen before I drove a tractor, I imagine. It was to a combine. It  was a little case tractor to pull on a combine. John Deere tractor was  probably the first one I was in the field with, I imagine. Then I had  Oliver tractors and Case and different tractors.  Did you have to do a few chores before you went to school each  morning?  Yes, we did, and after I got home from school, too.  He   d say when company would come, she   d send them out to get a  chicken, and that   s what they   d have for dinner.  Well, yes. We had a dog when I was a kid and even as a young man. His  name was Rover. Of course, we had chickens, and we just give them  free range after they got about so big. When the roosters got big enough  to eat, that   s when we   d have fried chicken. It   d be killed, and an hour  later they   d be on the table. This dog, he liked to catch those chickens.  We would take him with us, and we   d point him out, and he knew which  one to catch. Then about the time we   d reach down to pick it up, a lot of  times he   d let it go because he wanted to catch it again. (Laughter) That  dog, I think he was about sixteen years old when he died. He   d never  been to the vet. He   d never had dog food in his life. He just lived on  kitchen scraps all his life, and he lived that long without ever seeing a  vet.  That   s why he has such a fit about how people take care of dogs now.  (Laughs)  We used him with the cattle and stuff like that. You know, with five  boys, he was always out. There was always something going on. That  dog liked to be with them.  He wouldn   t chase the chickens unless you told him to?  That   s right.  Did you have a method for killing the chicken?  Yes, mother wrang their neck.  You didn   t? Your mother did?  My mother did.  13  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  That was her   I   m assuming she stopped teaching school when she had  all of these kids.  (Laughs) In all probability.  They walked to school. He   d say when they were on their way home, he  could smell bread and cookies and everything. He always remembers  walking that distance, smelling what she made for them before they got  home.  So where did you go to elementary school?  Down here at Timberlake, the little country school I was telling you  about. I went there five years, and then we got transferred to Jet, Jet  High School. Was a grade school and high school combination.  Had to ride a bus then or     We did. We rode a bus, came right by here.  And what would you take for lunch?  It was just a sack lunch like we always took down here to eat. I can  remember an apple or an orange, but I don   t remember what else. I   m  sure Mother had sandwiches.  Leftover chicken?  Well, probably. (Laughs) Probably.  But no refrigeration down there, I bet. We wouldn   t think of doing that  now, would we, leave our chicken out all day?  So what year did you graduate from Jet?  Nineteen forty-four from Jet.  During about the war time were you     Yes, that was   well, let   s see. The war ended in    45, didn   t it?  Yes.  I never went into the service and always regretted it very deeply. My dad  was sick and really bad sick for I don   t remember, two or three years.  Three older brothers that went, and they asked me to stay home. I think  14  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  it was in    45. Wasn   t it    45 when the war ended?  I think. I think it   s right around in there.  I graduated in    44. I did a lot of work while I was here.  Well, one was in the Marines, one was in the Air Force, and the other  one was in the Army. They were all gone except for him.  And they all made it back?  They did.  Yes, they did.  So tell us how you two met.  Well, we was in school together at Jet.  I moved to Jet in the fifth grade, only I was one year behind him. We  went to school together and then into high school. We started dating,  what     Yes, in high school.  Junior or senior, probably in high school.  I was probably a senior.  And you got married when?  In    47.  How did he pop the question?  Well     I think it was kind of mutual consent. (Laughter)  Yes. I don   t think we had any great romantic way of doing it. (Laughter)  We knew each other too well, I guess.  We just knew that was what we were going to do. I went to college for  two years, and then we married. Then I went back to college and  finished mine over at Alva. I went two years over here and two years  15  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  plus a summer over here at Alva and finished mine. Then I taught for  seven years, second grade.  By    over here    you mean OSU?  By that time, Jet and Nash were together, so I taught in that  combination. I taught at the Nash school, that combination of Jet and  Nash.  So your first two years of college were where?  In Stillwater, OSU.  You ask if there might be a graduate, OSU graduate. We   ve got ten of  our family that graduated OSU, counting our children and their wives  and our grandchildren.  Little bit of orange in that blood, isn   t there?  Yes, there is.  You bet, you ought to see the orange and the red. We   ve got two red  ones, and it   s really a rival. (Laughs)  Three. Tammie and Kimberly and     And Tai.     Tai, yes.  And did you go to OSU?  No.  One semester.  Well, yes, that was more of a vacation than anything else. (Laughter) I  just barely found my way around campus, anyhow.  He put five of us through school     It counts.     four kids and me.  So in    47 when you got married, did you come to this house then?  16  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  Yes, Mother moved. Mother lived here, and she moved to town, and we  moved in.  Been here sixty-six years.  And take us through some of the changes that you implemented on the  farm over that time period then.  Well, I haven   t built a lot of stuff. We just try to keep up what was here,  keep it good. I built a barn and a shed.  To begin with, when his dad died, there was a big estate. Back then, they  had to pay inheritance, so he had to really work to help pay for all that,  too.  Really, I haven   t built a whole lot but just tried to take care of what was  here.  Did you participate in any of the soil conservation efforts     Oh, yes.     like terracing and things like that?  Really. When I was a young man, soil conservation people had a  meeting down here at the schoolhouse. It was empty, but people used it  for quite a while. They give a demonstration about soil conservation, one  thing and another. As a young man, I got interested in it, and I   ve been  very conscious of soil conservation ever since. In 1949 when our oldest  child was born, we had a terrible sleet storm. Sleet just built up on the  ground about six inches thick. When it melted, it caused a lot of erosion,  and that   s what really started me on being conscious of soil conservation  and trying to not keep my ground clean all the time where it would wash  or blow.  In fact, I have just this year leased my tillable ground to people that  are   one of my requirements was that they no-till on account of  conservation. Even at that, with all my being careful and trying to do it  right, I   ve had erosion on that rolling ground, especially. I   ve been very  conscious of it, trying to do it right. I used to, or still did, a lot of what  they call, not clean till, but I can   t think of the word right now. It   s like  keeping trash or stubble and stuff on top of the ground near as you  could.  You use the county agent?  17  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  Oh, yes. I didn   t use the county agent much, but the county soil  conservation people, I   ve used. The government has had one really good  plan when they started participating in paying the farmers to make  terraces and doing a lot of different soil conservation things. That   s one  really smart thing that they did. Been a really wonderful thing, helping  the farmers do all that.  Were you in 4H or     No.      FFA in high school?  FFA, yes.  Betty Jo, were you involved with homemaker clubs or any     Yes, the extension club, yeah.  Were you a member of a club?  Yes.  What was the name of it?  It was the Jet Extension Club, at that time. They   ve changed their name  since then. I   m not real sure what the name is right now     Some kind of industrial        because I   m not in it anymore.  Industrial.  Industrial? I   m not in it right now.  Now, let   s back up a little bit. The farm was here during the Depression.  Do you remember? You were young.  The worst of that Depression would probably be, well, it was from    31 to     36 or somewhere right in that. I was just a kid. Had clothes to wear and  food to eat, and I didn   t care. (Laughs) Lived through that without any  feeling of being deprived or anything.  So when you took over the farm, you were still doing wheat and cattle?  18  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Yes, wheat and cattle. Like I said, I leased the ground this year. I ran the  combine this year, but I kept the cattle. I   m doing the cattle thing now,  and I will as long as I can get in my pickup and go see about them.  I was going to say, is retirement in sight, so no?  I thought about if I   d retired when I was sixty-five, that would   ve been  about, like, twenty-three years ago. What would I have been doing for  the last twenty-three years?  Tell them about your airplane that you   ve got.  I don   t know if you noticed our landing strip down there or not. Did you  notice?  No, I didn   t.  Kim and I, (he   s our son) we built an airplane, experimental airplane  they called it. It come in a kit, you know, like a model airplane, only it   s  big. (Laughs) The two of us made that. First flew it in  1990 . Kim  hasn   t flown it to speak of for quite a long time, but I did up until just a  couple years ago. I will again. Kim   s had some motor trouble, and I  didn   t know how to fix it, but Kim   s about got it ready to go again, so  I   ll fly it.  You got your pilot   s license when?  I was sixty-five before I got my pilot   s license. (Laughs)  Good for you  Have you been up with him, or is it a one     Once, once.  One time. (Laughter) I said,    I   ll take you out to dinner,    so we flew  down to Enid.  He came in and said,    You want to go out for dinner?    and I said,     Sure.    He says,    Okay,    so we got in the car, and he took me to the  plane.  We didn   t   you walked to the plane. (Laughs)  Walked to the plane, but it wasn   t out on the     Had to bribe her. (Laughs)  19  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  I guess it was down here.  You just don   t like doing it or     No.  Doesn   t appeal to me. (Laughs)  She   s a     I   m a what?  Well, I   m not going to say. (Laughter)  You   ll keep your feet on the ground.  Yes. (Laughter) I just didn   t care that much for it at all, but he loves it.  When I was a little ol    kid, you never heard or saw an airplane around  here. Whenever I   d hear one, I   d run out of the house to watch it as far  as I could see it. I built little model airplanes and then later on U-Control  airplanes they call it. Airplanes always, always fascinated me, so when  Kim came home from school, graduated from school and everything, he  started saying,    Dad let   s make an airplane.       No, no, no.    Finally, there  was one we was kind of interested in, and I said,    You can go out to the  factory,    it   s out in Idaho,    look it over and fly it and see the factory and  the people.    So he flew out there, and he come back, and he said,    Dad,  I think you   d like the airplane.    We ordered it, and it took us about three  years to put it together just in our spare time. It   s a two-place airplane.  It   s called   the name of it   s a Kitfox. It   s a beautiful little airplane,  really.  It   s not about the centennial farm, but it   s about him.  Did you build that air     Landing strip.     landing strip on your property?  Oh, yes.  So it   s part of the farm.  Yes   20  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Yes.  That   s true.  It   s out on the west side. You can see it. It   s got a windbag there.  And are you the only one that uses it, or do other ones around     Well, no, there   s other people landed there.  One time we had a group that came in from     A little fly-in.  Yes, a little fly-in.  I   d go to a lot of fly-ins. All the flying I did was just go out forty-five  minutes or an hour around there on a pretty morning or an evening and  go to the fly-ins. It   s just a pleasure, strictly.  It gives you a different perspective of the farm, too.  I like to see it, the topography of the farm, of the land.  They   ve called him to go help look for cattle. He   s gone to look for  cattle.  I never ever flew it without looking over the land while I was up. I say  never, but almost always I   d look around, just a pleasure deal. Take  people up, took a lot of people up, little short hops.  But sixty-five, that   s a     There   s a little bit more to that story I guess. When I was just a kid, my  older brother, the one that was about eight or ten years older than I, he  had a plane, and he taught me how to fly. I guess I was probably  seventeen or eighteen. I only got a few hours in, and he sold the plane.  Then I never did fly again, or even was up, until we built this plane. I  went down to Enid and took my training. You have to have a pilot   s  license to fly this plane.  I think that   s pretty cool. It is.  Yes, yes. Well, I think it is, too, really. I   ve got a book that   I don   t  know how to get it when you want to see it.  21  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  It   s okay.  I had met a man, a man that I know in Helena  Oklahoma . One time I  was coming out of the caf   there, and he was just coming in. We knew  each other but not around each other much, but we knew each other. I  met him out there on the sidewalk, and he said,    In two weeks, I   ll be a  hundred years old.    I just popped off and said,    Well, Melvin, when you  get to be a hundred, I   ll take you flying.    He said,    Okay.    Well, you  know, I was just popping off and didn   t think very much about that.  Then later on I saw him. I said,    Did you really want to go flying?    He  said,    Yes, I did.    I said,    We   ll go on your birthday.     He told me his birthday was March 15, so I called him up the day before,  and I said,    Melvin, we can go flying tomorrow.    He said,    Well, they  got a lot of things planned for me.    I said,    We can go in the morning.     So he drove out here from Helena. He was 101 then, and he was driving,  and he had his family with him. (Laughs) His son and daughter had to be  in their late seventies or eighties, but he was driving. So we went up, and  we flew down to his farm there north of Helena, and the Gloss  Mountains and the Cimarron River, came back. He just so thoroughly  enjoyed that.  How old were you?  Well, I was in my    80s, early    80s then.  That   s really funny. (Laughs) Eighty-year-old taking a hundred-year-old  flying.  When he was 102, we did the same thing again. It   s been one of the most  enjoyable experiences I had with flying because the uniqueness of the  thing and the way he enjoyed it, too. The whole family enjoyed it.  They trusted you to go with him, or him to go with you?  That   s another thing that   s always surprised me, at my age and in an  experimental airplane. I never did go around saying,    Hey, you want to  go flying?    I never did do that, or I never did ask anybody to go up with  me.  Except when they   d come out to visit, and then you   d say,    Do you want  to go?     Well, no, I didn   t ask them to go, Betty. They just wanted to go. If they  wanted to go, I was more than willing to take them. I never was one to  22  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  go around and say,    Hey, I got an airplane. Would you like to go  flying?    I never did do that. I had a lot of people, and I really enjoyed  doing that.  A one-hundred-year-old, that   s pretty     Yes.     significant, too. So you took over the farm in the    40s, and then the  social security came into effect in the    60s. Did they have to twist your  arm to do any of that?  You mean to take the social security money?  Yes. I mean, farmers, I   ve heard some didn   t want to do it, and others  did and     I didn   t do that for three, four, five years. I don   t remember how many,  but I did it, and they paid me back to when I could   ve taken it at sixty-five.  I participated in the social security.  Some farmers didn   t want to     Yes.     so I was just curious if     That   s according to if they had any money or not, probably. (Laughs)  Yeah, that had a lot to do with it.  Maybe, maybe.  Well, like I said, I waited a while okay, but I finally decided I might as  well do it.  Well you would   ve been in your forties, I guess, when that program  started up so     Oh, I don   t know. Well, it started with Franklin Roosevelt, didn   t it,  back in     Oh, earlier than that then.  Did it?  23  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  I   ll have to look it up.  Yes, I think he was the ol    boy that started that.  I noticed the house has a front porch. Do you have any favorite stories  from memories of things that   s happened on that front porch?  Oh, just us kids playing on it and sleeping out there in the summertime  when it was really, really hot. We just had cots. We would sleep out  there on the front porch because it was hot. In fact, when Betty and I  were married and lived in the house here, there wasn   t any air  conditioning of any kind, and it was really hot in the summertime.  Tell them about the dust storms.  Yes, the field right across the road from us blew so bad. Of course, we  didn   t have near as good windows as we do now, but I used a scoop  shovel for a dust pan     In here.     to clean up this room with.  Then we finally put sheets up, wet sheets, up at the windows to keep it  from coming in.  Yes we did that. (Laughs) Things have changed so much, you know.  Do you have a favorite room in the house?  Not until Betty and I built on the den. Well, I   ll tell you, the opening  there had doors that close back in the wall, and that was called the parlor  at that time. They called it the parlor. That was only for special  occasions. The kids didn   t go in there because mother kept that. That  was her parlor. It had a piano in there and I suppose some other  furniture. I don   t remember, but I can remember kids just didn   t play in  there. So I suppose this room, the kitchen.  Where would bath time be as a youngster?  Oh, Saturday night. (Laughs)  And where?  I don   t know why this was, but for some reason, even though the  bathroom was there, I don   t know why, I actually can remember taking  24  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  baths in tubs.  In the kitchen, wasn   t it?  Yes, in the kitchen.  Where it was warm.  I don   t know why that would   ve been that way. I   ve thought about that,  but evidently the plumbing wasn   t there, I suppose.  Well, it didn   t have heat in there, either.  Not only we didn   t have the heat but then probably didn   t have hot  water. I imagine that   s probably the reason. I think Mother just heated  the water up on the stove.  As the youngest, would you have to go last or first?  (Laughs) I don   t remember.  Probably last.  Yes.  Well, with the piano, did anyone take lessons?  Yes, my sister did, but I never did. I don   t think any of the boys did. My  sister   s name is Jessie Mary. That was after my mother and my grandma.  There   s the picture of the lady. There   s Grandma on that homestead at  the farm.  Okay.  So Jessie Mary was named after. My mother   s name was Jessie; her  name was Mary. When I was kid, that would   ve been over eighty years  ago. I don   t remember a whole lot.  Well, was music or radio important at that time?  Radio, I can remember that, oh, we listened to Little Orphan Annie. On  the radio, we   d run home from school, turn on the radio, and listen to  those radio programs.  Jack Armstrong, the All American Boy.  25  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Yes, (Laughs), Jack Armstrong. This house has been on fire twice, three  times. We had a radio, sat right there between those two big windows,  and you had to have an aerial on the radio, an outside aerial, a wire that  came in. Lightning hit that, brought it into the radio. We were all  upstairs sleeping, and it set that radio on fire, and set the curtains on fire.  Dad came down and put that out. I don   t think there was much danger of  the house burning down because it was the curtains on fire, and it just  caught real quick. Another time, my sister Jessie Mary, just a young girl,  the biggest bedroom upstairs had a closet, and she set that thing on fire.  It charred the wood bad enough, the trim, that it blistered it. It could   ve  just went,    Pfff     you know.  What   d she start the fire with?  I don   t know, probably a candle or matches or something. Then Donald  and I when we were just kids, we got real bright and set the grass on fire  out here when it was dead (Laughs) and had a little cedar tree right by  the house, which that   s a no-no to put any kind of a cedar tree close to  your house. We got it out right away. It wasn   t     How had you set it   how did you that? How did you and your     Well, you know, I don   t remember that, either. I can remember very  plainly us burning it. We thought we   d burn the yard off. (Laughs)  Then also they   ve shot     Yes, well, (Laughs) with five boys raised here in the house and guns, all  us kids hunting jackrabbits and ducks. My brother Earl, my oldest  brother, had a shotgun go off in the kitchen, go through the window.  They told me about that. Then one time, (I was in on this, and I don   t  remember whether I was the one that did it or not) we had a rifle go off  in this room here, just boys being boys, messing with their guns.  I guess that would fall under the category    fun   ?  (Laughs) Yes.  Well, yes, boys being boys, I guess, more than anything.  What were some other things you would do for fun, you know, in your  teenage and young adult years?  I can tell you one thing we did a lot. Just a quarter mile east of us, there  was two boys about the age of my brother just older than I. They was  just about exactly the same age as we were. We spent a lot of time  26  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  playing with those two boys. They   d be down here, we   d be up there,  we   d go fishing     On horses. They had their horses.  Yes, we had horses. Another thing we did a lot, just go up here to the  corner a quarter mile and go two miles south. There was a recreation  place there that had a swimming pool, slide, diving board, tower, and a  spring. That was the recreation area for this part of the country. It had  Sunday School classes and reunions over there on a Sunday and  Saturday. We   d go over there a lot. That was one of our big summer  things. We   d go swimming in a pool that had a fence built around.  Wasn   t very good. First people over there throwed out the frogs and the  toads. (Laughs)  Tell her about some of the things you made yourself, like that little  wheel that you would push     Oh, well        and guns that you   d make with     Yes, we were kids, just kids.  Well, yeah, but it   s interesting how they used to make their own toys.  You may have seen these or heard of   our hoops were actually just iron.  They were off of wagon wheels is what they were off of. You   d take a  lath and put them right across the end of it, roll those things around.  Then we   d make little ramps and stuff.  Stilts, you made stilts.  Yes, stilts was one of the things we played with a lot.  Guns with the   shoot rubber arrows.  I don   t know, whatever boys do. Snowball fights and stuff like that.  Gourd fights, these gourds that grow around.  What would you do, just throw them at each other?  Yes, throw them at each other, dodge. (Laughs) You   d have sides. We  did that a lot. Ride the horses, fish     Didn   t take a lot of expensive toys, that   s for sure.  27  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  No, no. You didn   t do that at all.  And the closest town was     Well, we lived right between Jet and Helena, just about both. Helena  was a foreign country to me when I was a boy. Jet was it. After I was  married and buying hardware and different things, I used Helena a lot.  Still do. Still have, down through the years. It   s a little bigger town than  Jet. By the time I got big enough, Jet had lost their hardware, but Helena  had hardware and things like that. I do a lot of that, down through the  years. Still do. I know people in Helena do     The Cherokee        business with people in Helena.  Where was the closest theater?  Well, Jet and Helena both had a theater at one time.  Bowling alley.  Jet had an implement dealer, two grocery stores and a creamery and two  pool halls and two barber shops.  A movie and a bowling alley.  Like all these towns.  Down to nothing now.  In fact, Timberlake School now is at Jet. Helena   s got  grade  seven  through high school, and Jet   s got one through six. Right now they   ve  got less people in them. Jet and Nash were together at one time, and  Helena and Goltry together. Now it   s all four of them, and the four of  them together is not as big as Jet was by itself when I first started going  there. They was putting in the dam up here, the last part of the dam, and  there was 400 kids in the Jet school. I think they had seven buses going  around picking up the kids from a pretty big area up north of the river all  the way down to almost Helena, towards Cherokee and towards Nash.  It   s came from that to four towns together now. Probably got 200-and-some  in the four schools and they   re going downhill.  And the churches are going downhill. A lot of them are. The trouble  with a lot of these little towns, too, there   s so much drugs, the drug  28  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  people. A lot of them are coming out into rentals, cheap rentals, rental  houses.  It   s the economy, of course. That   s what happened to all little towns. It  was all farm deal. People came down here, made that run, staked out 160  acres, and thought they was going to make a living. They soon found out  they couldn   t, and they   d just gradually sell off. Then World War II  come in. A lot of people went up to Wichita and worked for aircraft  people up there. A lot of air craft at Wichita, and they just never did  come back. They   d sell the farms. People couldn   t make a living. They  wanted to, but it never was practical to try to make a living off a quarter.  And what kept you all here then?  Well, Dad and about everybody else was still here, and enough land to  where you can think you can do it.  So they started with 160. Do you have more than that now?  I do, yes. Dad bought a lot of land, and now I   m here with that. I bought  a couple of places since then. One of them, my son bought me out. He  owns that, but I bought another place. Just make it viable enough.  So roughly how many acres are you managing these days?  We own about  840  acres. It   s more than half grass. Cattle   s always  been real important in my economic scheme.  How many head of cattle are you running?  Right now I got about 140, but the last few years the other person has  owned the cattle, and I just take them in. The way I do it I get so much a  pound for every pound I put on them, but I used to always own and buy  my own cattle. The last few years, I don   t have the help to really get  them started. For several years, I bought them big enough to where I  didn   t have to wean them and do all that stuff, so I didn   t have that  sickness. Then the last few years, I   ve taken somebody else   s cattle in. I  take care of them just like they   re my own. I see about them. If any of  them get sick, I doctor them and take care of them. That   s what I   m still  doing now. That   s what I want to do.  So describe a typical day for us today.  Well, today     Today doesn   t count.  29  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf     if you guys hadn   t have been coming today     What would you have been doing?     the first thing I   d have probably done would have been go check the  cattle. You always got to check the water, make sure the water   s right.  You   ll check the numbers. Then you check the health. If the number   s  right   . If they   re not, you look for a sick one or something that   s out.  It   s not a big thing to do. It   s just something I really like to do as far as  taking any energy or anything like that because you   re just driving  around in your pickup. A couple, three days ago, I spent a couple hours  driving staples into fence. I spend a lot of time now, not a lot of time but  quite a bit of my time, just trying to do some things around the house  here and the farmstead that I wasn   t doing otherwise. It   s because I  never had two things, the inclination and the time.  Do you keep up with the stock market and that type of thing for cattle?  Not on a day-to-day basis, no.  Okay. The weather?  Yes, the weather and the markets, cattle market, wheat market, that sort  of thing.  Betty Jo, what about you, while he   s out doing the farm what are you  doing?  I   ve been sewing. I   m a sewer.  Okay.  That   s what I like to do. I have a sewing room upstairs that I just really  enjoy being in. The last week, our daughter in Enid who teaches third  and fourth grade, (she   s teaching fourth grade this year) she   s wanting  me to make curtains and little skirts for all of the tables. That   s what I   ve  been doing the last two weeks upstairs. I usually like to sew whenever I  can. I belong to a quilt group, and that   s my big thing, quilting.  Well, when the kids were at home and he was busier on the farm, did you  have certain chores or things that you had to do while he was out?  Well, just keep up with them and the in-school activities, and I sewed for  them. I made a lot of their clothes, a lot of their things that they had to  have, and to keep up with their activities. That   s what I did while he was  30  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  working out.  So we should back up and say how many children do you have?  Four. We have three girls and a boy.  So you got to make a lot of pretty dresses.  Yes, I did. I made a lot of formals and a lot of all kinds of things, really.  Then I   ve also done a lot of craft stuff, made dolls and clowns, all kinds  of things, pillows galore. That   s just what I like to do.  Do you take them to the county fair?  I don   t. I never did like competition. I do it for pleasure or to give to  somebody or to help somebody, or gifts, but I didn   t ever like the  competition. I did for a little while, now, but that wasn   t for me. That   s  one reason I quit the extension club after a while because I thought it  was too much. Everything was competition, everything, and that   s not  my thing.  Did you have a garden early on, and do you still have one?  Yes, had one. No, we don   t now, but, boy, I had a big garden, yes. Did  more freezing, I think, than canning. I did some canning, too, but I got to  where I was freezing everything.  You were going to say something?  No, only that we did have a garden. We gave up on that. Oh, we had it  for quite a while, but it takes quite a bit of time if you do it right, the  canning and keeping it clean and     It was fun while it lasted, anyway.  Didn   t want to do it.  Then I was in school a lot. I went to school after he   oh, let   s see. I   d go  out and haul wheat in and get underneath the truck and read my lessons  for the next day at college. Then I would go to school all day and come  home and do whatever we had to do around here to help with the  harvesting and stuff. Then I went during the summers, went to school.  Well, I was teaching. I taught for seven years. I haven   t had a lot of time  to do too much, but I sew in between all the times.  So you had some supplemental income from yours. Did you have a job  31  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  off the farm, too?  No.  It was always just the farm.  No, Betty, for a while there.  And the    80s were pretty tough. Was it tough?  Yes, they     Yes, terrible.  We didn   t have crop insurance for a long time there if you had a crop  failure, and we had a lot of them early on. You know,    55,    56 was  terrible droughts. Then we had bad hailstorms and real bad windstorms  with rain. We had one storm, our first child was just a baby. It blew  down our barn, blew all the doors off a building, blew some trees down  and at least one window out. Then we had, other times, we   d have a  good wheat crop out there and get hailed really bad. You lost crops, and  you didn   t have any crop insurance. When they come along with crop  insurance   I don   t know how long ago that   s been going on, but I took  it right away. That   s one insurance program that I   m ahead of, crop  insurance.  Was there any time when you thought you might lose the farm?  No, I never did think about losing it, but a lot of discouragement,  though. You discouraged. A lot of borrowed money down through the  years.  How did you keep your records in the older day versus today? Has that  changed much?  Betty does real good record keeping now. I never was one to keep  records, like in a book like they was supposed to be, but really it didn   t  make any difference from a standpoint. I just didn   t spend any money I  didn   t have to in the first place. Then when it come income tax time, I  had the checks there. Just sort them all up, add them all up, check them  over with the bank statements and make sure everything balanced out,  make sure I had my numbers all right. That was my bookkeeping, but it  was honest and right.  How had your father and your mother   how had they kept     32  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  I don   t know. That   s before my remembrance.  His dad died when he was a senior in high school.  Yes, somewhere right in there, Betty.  Yes, it was.  Like I said, he had been   he had Bright   s disease which is a disease  now they wouldn   t even put you in the hospital for. Because it was an  infection, they didn   t have anything to knock it out. He suffered with  that for quite a long time. That   s a difference, too. I don   t know where  Betty and I   d be health-wise without having all the surgery and medicine  they got now. Both of us would probably have been gone, I imagine.  Well, I don   t know about that.  Well     Speak for yourself. (Laughs)  I probably would  We both might be here, but I don   t know.  If you   ve   been taking medicine, you don   t know. Strokes and heart attacks, you  got medicine now that help you prevent those, so how do you know?  Well, you mentioned church a little bit earlier. Was that a big part of  your life?  Very big.  Our Christian faith has been     Still is.     a real big part of our lives, been a big part of our family and a big part  of the way we   ve raised our family. Been a big part of the way our kids  have turned out. They   re all Christian, and their families are Christian.  We love them, they love us, they love one another. Our spiritual life has  been very important to us.  Everybody met around the table for mealtime?  Well, we don   t anymore, but we used to.  When the children were young?  33  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  When the kids was young.  Oh, yes, always.  We   d say grace, and of course whenever we have any kind of festivities  going on here at home, we   ll say grace around, like, Thanksgiving and  Christmas and different times. They do when we go to their house. It   s  not necessarily saying grace. It   s more of a prayer     I was about to say.     a prayer of thanks for the family and for our life. Betty and I have  been so blessed, a lot of times without realizing it, but looking back, I  can see that, blessed with family.  Lots of grandkids.  Yes, seven grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren.  Ten grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren.  We haven   t got ten grandchildren have we?  I think so. (Laughter)  I don   t know. I think it   s seven     Name them off. (Laughs)      but the great-grands just keep popping up all the time.  Well, anyway, when we get together there   s twenty-five of us.  No, more than that, Betty. There   s thirty-two. (Laughter) Yes, there is.  I only counted twenty-five. (Laughter)  I   ve counted them in there in the picture.  I   m the one that gets the meals. I think it was twenty-five.  No, there   s thirty-two of us now.  Are any of them interested in staying on the farm, keeping with it?  Not really. Our son, he   s got a job, and he   s got a business, too. He   s  34  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  holding down two things. He would like to, but right now he just doesn   t  have the time. I think probably when Betty and I are gone and he gets  retired, he   ll probably want to do that. He wants to, and in a way I   ve  kind of discouraged him on account of it being he lives not so far away,  but all my machinery is old. It   s supposed to outlast me, but I outlasted  it. (Laughs) It   s all old and wore out, and he   d have to buy a lot of new  machinery, and then the time involved. He   s busy, really busy, all the  time, anyhow. If he   d drive over here and do that, see about the cattle,  it   d really be a burden, I feel like, so that   s the reason I   ve discouraged  him. If he wants to, I   d like to see him do it someday.  But they all have  nice  homes,  and  one daughter would like to have  this one whenever we   re gone. We have one that wants it, anyway, but  we hate to see it go downhill after we   re gone. I hope somebody comes  because it wouldn   t take them long. Once you   re out of them, they  just     Are you going to plan for that or just let chance     Well, you know, we   ve thought a lot about it.  Well, she   s the only one that has said to everybody that she would like to  have it. The rest of them have  nice  homes. They can   t just   I mean,  that   s the way they wanted to build and where they wanted to build  them, so you can   t do anything about it.  Christmas and holidays will still be here, then, more than likely?  Yes, that   s what she thought. Her boys, she has three boys that love to  come out here. In fact, when my folks died they had a house in Jet, and  they bought that house, those boys did, so that they would have that,  come out and go hunting. They come out and go up there, and then  they   ll come visit us every time they come. That   s why I think she   d  really like to have it, so she can keep all this for the boys. They come out  a lot.  How do you keep up with new government programs?  For what? For the farm, you mean?  For the farm.  Well, they   ve done away with direct payment. Now about all you have  to do, really, is your insurance, and you have to go the county office a  couple, three times a year. That   s about all that amounts to now. From a  soil conservation point, I   ve kept up with that, and I   ve worked with  35  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  them all the time. I   ve been involved, especially with the agricultural  office. Everybody calls the agricultural office. Yes, you have to go over  there and make your reports and sign a lot of papers and all that. I   ve  always participated in that because, one thing, you   ve got to have the  insurance.  You mentioned earlier that one of your requirements for a new renter  was doing no-till.  Yes.  What are your thoughts on no-till farming?  Well, my understanding really is from a soil conservation point, and it  looks to me like is probably you   re going see more of it all the time. One  of the reasons, too, there is on account of the help. You used to have  boys up in high school that was looking for summer jobs, and you   d hire  some boys to help you during the summer. I didn   t ever have the  machinery for no-till because it   s very expensive. One man, just like  they take these big sprayers, go out. Like the people I lease to, they got a  sprayer that takes 120 foot in one swath. They can go out and do a  thousand acres in a day. Instead of taking a tractor and going out there,  trying to till a thousand acres and take two or three weeks, they can go  out there in one day and do it by theirselves without any help. That   s one  of the big things that   s driving no-till is that.  In fact, that   s the big thing that   s driving it. That   s even over soil  conservation because a lot of people, they don   t do soil conservation.  They just are not as concerned as they should be about erosion and stuff,  but a lot of people are concerned. That   s what   s driving no-till. They do  those   like the drills and stuff do a really good job. They got that GPS  in them. Have you ever noticed how straight those lines are? The  spacing, they go, like, sixty foot. You want your drill spacing just about,  so when they lap, they don   t lap over. They don   t do this. That   s just the  same. You wouldn   t know one round from the next. They   re great.  In other words, he loves it.  Are a lot of your neighbors going no-till?  One of them is that   s close by. That   s the only one I know of. Like I  said, these boys, I rented the canola to them, land, last year. I did the  wheat, but they put the canola in for me a year ago and this year, both.  They did that with their big no-till deal. I don   t know how you notice it,  the canola stubble out here now. I don   t know. You probably didn   t  notice, but, see, it   s covered up pretty well right now, but volunteer  36  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  canola and the canola stems, the stalk, is still left there. That   s no-till.  They leave that stuff there, and it won   t wash nor blow near as bad.  Well, it won   t blow at all and won   t wash anywhere near as bad. That   s  the reason I told them we were strictly no-till. That   s what they wanted  anyhow because that   s the equipment they got. The reason they got that  equipment, they can do so much. They farm a lot, a lot of acres. I don   t  know how much acres they farm, a lot of them. Getting more all the  time, with people like me quitting.  Do you maintain the mineral rights for the     Yes, we did. We do and did.  Any luck? Any luck there?  Yes we   re     I got that place that I bought, but I only got forty acres of mineral rights  on that. It   s 160, and they drilled a well on it, but it   s just a mediocre  well. Right now we   re getting about 300 dollars a month off of that. We  had another place leased, 160. Well, in fact, in the early 1970s, they  came in here and drilled a whole lot of vertical gas wells. There wasn   t  any wells to be covered off, and they never were siting anything, but  they just kept producing them like we was in on four or five wells. One  of them, you   d likely have to go for six months before they   d generate  enough money to even pay you. Some of them as low as two dollars and  fifty cents a month. (Laughs) In this last year, you might say, they   ve  closed those in. They started drilling these horizontal wells. We had one  place over here leased, and they let it go. They just let it lay out, didn   t  renew it. I told Betty, I said,    Looks like they just missed us. We   re  going to miss it.    Then it wasn   t two or three weeks until SandRidge   Energy , which is a big company around here, they called and wanted  to lease that land for a big price. Since then, they   ve drilled two wells on  it. There   s not any production yet because it   s just so     They just finished it.  In all probability     They got two more staked out.     there   s going to be some wells there. We don   t know what it   s going  to be like, but it doesn   t look like they   re going to miss us. (Laughs) It  wouldn   t make any difference if Betty and I had ten million dollars in  the bank. It   s not going to make any difference to us in our lifestyle, not  one bit. In fact, we   ve already given a lot of that away that we got for the  37  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  lease. It   s not going to make us any difference.  Has the drilling in Alfalfa County helped a lot of people?  Oh, yes, it   s poured money in here. Some of the wells are really good.  Some of them are just mediocre. Once and a while, they get one that   s  not very good at all. Oh, yes, Alfalfa County, the northern part of the  county and even around Cherokee. Of course, Alva   s in Woods County.  Yes, it   s poured a lot of money.  But they   re coming in now, coming up from all ways, and they are really  going to be a lot of them.  You can go over to Cherokee there, and it   s like if you eat at the Pizza  Hut or something, you   re just sitting there. While you   re eating, there  might be fifteen, twenty or more oil-related trucks go by, most of them  tankers.  Have you noticed any earthquakes?  Oh, have we  (Laughs)  Yes  In fact, wasn   t it day before yesterday morning? No, it was  evening, nine forty-five. It   s in the paper today that it was a 4.0 and  that   s the ones that are   any time it gets up to four   . When it hit, I was  upstairs sewing, and E. L. was taking a shower, so he didn   t even know  it happened. I looked real quick to see what time it was. It was nine  forty-five, and sure enough it was in the paper then yesterday that it was  a 4.0 and it was at nine forty-five. It rumbled for longer than the others  that I   ve heard. It rumbled for quite a while. Did you feel it at Stillwater?  Not the one the other night.  We   ve had a few in the last several month, though, that rattle.  Well, that one the other night, it rumbled longer than most of them. I  don   t know what they   re going to do. This one in the paper today said  that it cracked some guy   s walls, so I think we   re going to have some  reports of stuff from now on, I think. I don   t know whether it   s from the  oil. Of course, they think it is. I was telling E. L.,    Why haven   t they had  those earthquakes in Texas?    Has more oil than we do, doesn   t it?  I was thinking about wouldn   t it be terrible if it damaged this house and  you couldn   t get your doors open or something like that. All the doors in  the house would be   maybe cracked the windows and walls or  something. It   d just be terrible, not on this house but it   d be everybody   s.  38  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  Nykolaiszyn  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  This one   s stood a hundred. Going to go another hundred.  Out there on the sidewalk, it says 1916. I got curious about when the  house was actually built. This used to be Woods County at one time.  Alfalfa County was Woods County. I went over to the courthouse in  Alva, and I asked them about it, to look at the records. They said the  earliest record they had on this house was 1914, so that   s what I   m  calling it: built in 1914.  What are some of the remaining structures still on the farm today?  About everything you see, really. I don   t know when it was built  because they were here. Like I said, I built the barn and the shed. Then  we lost the old barn. There was an old hen house, we called it, made out  of blocks, was here at one time. I tore that down. The rest of the  buildings I just try to keep from falling down, you might say. (Laughs)  I noticed a windmill was   roughly how old it might be?  Yes, it   s written out there on the   but the windmill, the fan is ruined,  which I regret. What happened to that, that big old tree grew up in it.  The tail on a windmill is what keeps them out of the wind so they won   t  run. The tree grew in that tail and it kept the   from swiveling around. In  a high wind, the tail will swivel those windmills out of the wind where  they won   t turn. Well, it caught in the trees, and then we have these  terrible storms where they have a   wind maybe sixty or seventy mile an  hour. The fan, trying to get out of those trees, it tore it all up. I regret  that. Out here on this, Mother   s writing is out there. I know it   s Mother   s  writing out there in the cement. I think it   s 1912 when they put the  windmill in.  You   ve also done some work to restore or to preserve some of the  buildings out there. Could you talk a little bit about that?  All I   ve done, really, is try to just not let them deteriorate.  Are they wrapped in aluminum, or were they wrapped?  Oh, the building? That   s what they call corrugated steel. The old house  out here, there   s been metal put on that since it   s been built, and metal  on the roof. That was all before my time.  We have the fifty-year structure certificate for the outbuilding.  Or a chicken house, I think was one wasn   t it? A chicken house? Wash  39  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  house?  Yes, that was the hen house he   s talking about, yes.  This one house is what they called a chicken house, and the one old  building down there, it was a granary at one time. It had bins all the way  through. I   ve took a lot of those out. One time I used it for a shop, and  the other was just a storage building. Then this one, this garage right  straight  north  of the house here, was the  house . I was the one that  made this into a garage, which I shouldn   t have done. I should   ve kept it  like it was.  That was the original house he   s talking about. He made it into a garage  so that it would still be there.  I just always thought I   d want to tear these down, a lot of them, build a  big barn, but I never did, but I did keep them up.  Was there a cellar?  Yes, there was at one time a cave. I call it a cave. In my young life and  in my ignorance, I filled it in with dirt. (Laughs)  There   s a one-room basement here. There   s a basement under this.  Well, that   s where you go if there was a tornado? Would you head  there?  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Well, the only two or three times we   ve ever went to it, Betty would go  to it, but I don   t get excited about it much. That time we had that terrible  storm where it blew down the barn and tore the doors off and blew down  trees, it was just so bad I wanted to get out of it. It lasted quite a long  time. I come up, just run out and look, and I could see little twisters up  in the sky, three or four of them, small. They never did come down. I  think it was a strong wind, and it completely ruined the wheat. It was on  May 20, 1949. It just flattened everything. That was a real bad one.  We   ve had some tornadoes around but not close to the house. We   ve had  a lot of bad windstorms. You probably didn   t notice, but after the leaves  are gone, all these ol    trees are old, and they   re really mangled up if you  really look close. Great big limbs out of them, that big around. I still  carry limbs out. They are in really bad shape. They look good now. They  got a lot of foliage on them.  40  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  They look pretty.  I   ve planted a few trees, nothing like I should   ve had because I don   t  know why, really. We   ve got three maples out here along the road that  are nice and a couple of mulberries out here. There   s one old cedar tree  on this farm that I know is older than I am. Still got one cedar tree. We  got a couple of lilac bushes I know that   s at least as old as I am or older  that   s still here. The trees, they   re all Chinese elms, most of them, and  they   re old. I think my brother just older than I, (I   m not sure, and it   s  not written in concrete anywhere) I think we planted those when we  were just kids like fourteen, fifteen, sixteen years old. That   s the reason  they   re all about the same size and all about the same age.  Well, you pull up, and it looks quite homey and inviting.  (Laughs) Yes.  Well, good.  Yes, has that good feel about it.  Well, thank you.  That   s good, thank you. He just put a flower garden out there for the first  time, too, in front of that old     Yes, before you ladies leave, if the rain leaves, I   d like for you to go  down to this little garage. I   ve got the original old little cabinet that was  in Grandma   s dugout down there.  Oh, cool.  You see that. You can look at the original homestead certificate.  Well, it is a rainy day on the farm. Typically on a rainy day, what would  you do if we weren   t here?  Well, at my age, I   d probably be in the house. (Laughter)  Back when you were     Oh, I don   t know.  Always something to do on the farm.  41  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  If it was raining bad, I would probably be in the shed or be in the house  probably. I don   t know. I never was one to spend any time uptown.  He   s really not one to stay in the house, either. (Laughs)  No, I won   t stay in the house. I   ll do something. I never was one to go  uptown a whole lot. I do some, did some, but not very much.  He   d probably be working in the shop on something.  Yes, I   d be doing something. I don   t know what.  He   d be busy. He can   t stay in here very long.  Sometimes I watch television, some, quite a bit. Sometimes we   ll go  almost all day without ever turning the television on.  We can   t find anything on it, anyway, that we like. (Laughter)  I can remember when we got our first television. Can you girls  remember when we didn   t have television?  I can remember when it was black and white but not     Yes.     when we didn   t have one.  I remember when we had a little tiny thing about like that.  I can remember when we got it, and it had to be, I think, around    51 or     52. Eisenhower was running for president. It was just about the time  they were having their conventions, and I was pretty fascinated with that  because I liked Ike. (Laughs) I watched that. You couldn   t get television  most of the time except every evening. The rest of the time it was just  snow     Static.     static and snow. You had to have an outside aerial.  Talk about change. That   s where your change is, really.  Telephones, cellphones.  Yes.  42  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  It   s ridiculous, unbelievable.  Do you keep a cellphone with you?  I got one but the simplest one I could get. All I want to know how to do  is say,    Hello.    I want to punch in the numbers when I want to call  somebody. (Laughter) Betty, she   s got the     I   ve got the iPhone.  She   s got the one.  Technology   s grand in a lot of ways and not so much in others.  It is. It is, you   re right, especially when your grandkids come and all  they do is sit there like this. I don   t like that.  Yes, that telephone deal, cellphone     They   re not as bad now as they were. They used to be, though.     they   re unbelievable, really, aren   t they?  Yes.  They really are.  Amazing.  So when you reach a hundred, your son   ll have to come take you up in  the airplane. (Laughter)  I don   t know. I don   t know.  He   s got pretty good health for an eighty-eight-year-old man.  We   ll come back and watch.  Yes, okay. (Laughter)  That   s just something you don   t know, really don   t have any idea of.  Been a good life though?  You bet.  43  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Oh my, yes.  Betty and I have been blessed a lot. That   s all there is to it.  And it all started right above us.  I believe   oh, yes. (Laughs)  In the bed, in the bedroom. (Laughs)  Both ways. I know what you   re thinking. That, too.  Yes, you can look at it both ways. (Laughs)  You know, we   ve had some really bitter disappointments.  We   ve had two son-in-laws die. We   ve got  three  girls, and two of their  husbands died.  I lost my brother that taught me how to fly. He died at forty-seven, and  that really hurt because we slept together, had same bedrooms. He taught  me how to fly because he could fly. There   s enough difference in age of  us that I looked at him as a big brother that knew how to fly. He was  always just really good to me, where boys more your age, you   re  more     Competitive and stuff.  Well, you know, you   re     Competitive, she   s right, yes.  It was just a matter of age. But that really hurt. Our youngest daughter  lost her husband, and  had a  little girl, four years old, and one infant  eleven months old. Just one of those and that really, really hurt.  Just dropped dead, heart attack.  We   ve had those kind of things happen to us.  We   ve wondered, now, here we are this long, and we just now could  have some money with oil wells, but that   s all right. Like he said, we  wouldn   t change anything anyway. We   ll just give it to the kids or give  it away. Give it away.  44  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  Finchum  B. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  B. Metcalf  E. Metcalf  Finchum  E. Metcalf  I don   t know how many different charities we give to every month. It  doesn   t make any difference.  Well, do you want to     We   ll close up if there   s nothing else that you        see the house?  If there   s nothing else you want to add, we   ll sign off, and thank you  very much.  If you ladies really want to see the   I   d like for you to.  She just wanted to know if there was anything else we wanted to say  before they turn the     Oh, I don   t know, I guess not about ourselves. We talked about  ourselves too much already. (Laughs)  It   s been a pleasure, though. Thank you for sharing with us.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
