 Finchum  Today is June 15, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I am here  today with Don Wingo of Yale, Oklahoma. We   re doing an oral history  for the Centennial Farm Families of Oklahoma Project and it   s for the  OSU Library. My first question is how did your family came to own this  land?  Well, I guess in 19 and 7 Grandpa Wingo bought it. The two sons, John  and George, they bought it but Grandma and Grandpa Wingo went to  mortgage. They loaned them the money, I guess, to pay for it. And so  they started living on it and raising crops.  How many acres did they own?  There were 160. It was originally Indian land, but there was one more  white family that had it before they bought it. My dad and Uncle George  came here in 19 and 8 and there were no buildings. They lived in a tent  the first year, until they could get a house built.  And they came from where?  From Skedee. Up by Skedee, Oklahoma. They originally came from  Kansas   well they started out in Kentucky and then moved to Kansas.  That   s where most of the kids were born, all except the oldest one. Aunt  Kitty was born in Kentucky.  And then     Dad and Uncle John, they divided the land and Uncle John took the  north 80 and Dad took the south 80. They built the house, the first house  in probably about 19 and 9, I guess. Dad and my mother was married  January the 12th, 19 and 10.  And then they lived on this?  5  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Yeah, they lived right over there across the road. There   s an aerial photo  of the land, all the property.  Had a nice pond.  Yes.  So what did they farm on their part?  Well, first started out in the early days was cotton.  Cotton.  That was the first cash crop they had that made any money, wasn   t much  money in anything else. They raised cotton. That   s how they paid and  finished paying for the land, raising cotton. Finally in 19 and 16 they  paid the mortgage off and they bought it in 19 and 8. So they were eight  years getting it paid for. (Laughs)  That   s pretty good.  Yeah.  And how many children did they have?  Just Ruby (my sister) and me. We   re the only two.  Where would they take their cotton to sell it?  I think they had one at Maramec then, a cotton gin.  A cotton gin?  Yeah. All these towns around probably had a cotton gin, because they  raised cotton all over the country. That was the main cash crop for  everybody. Wasn   t any money in cattle or chickens or raising eggs or     they all took the eggs and the chickens to town on Saturday and the  cream. That   s what they sold that to get the groceries to come home  with.  Did they do that in Maramec or Yale?  Maramec was a pretty good town way back there in 1920. It was not too  bad a town after World War II was over with.  And that   s where they shopped?  6  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Yes. And then they started going to Yale. They were going to Yale  mostly right during the war I guess, World War II.  And so when were you born?  December the 15th, 19 and 15.  On the farm?  Yeah, right in that old house. That same house over there. My sister was  born on August the 4th, 19 and 12 in that same house.  So did you have to help pick cotton?  I picked some cotton, not a great lot but I did.  And then when they switched from cotton, what did they do?  Well, they raised corn, stuff like that to feed the chickens, you know.  And the corn they fed it to the hogs. They usually raised some hogs to  butcher for meat and they had to have some to sell. Same way with  chickens, raised them for the eggs and had some to eat in the summer  time. Young chickens would come on, they started eating fried chicken  all summer. (Laughter)  So what were some of your chores as a child?  Well, I helped with the milking, I milked the cows. Probably I wasn   t  over six or eight years old and I was milking cows. They assigned me so  many old gentle cows maybe thinking they could do it themselves.  (Laughter) They   d take the wild ones, I guess, and let me strip the little  ones that were more gentle.  Where did you go to school?  Maramec. Right up the road here, about three and a half miles northeast  of here.  And how would you get there?  Oh, when I first started out they had the old wagon school bus, was  drove with horses.  Really?  Horses, yeah. Finally got the old truck and they built a bed on the old  7  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  truck and made a school bus out of it and all the kids went to school with  that old truck, in the early days of going to school.  How many children would be in the school?  In the class? Oh, probably not over a dozen, dozen or 15 maybe.  Did your mother have a garden?  Oh yeah. Always raising a nice garden. Had some fruit trees.  What kind of fruit?  Well, mostly peaches I think. Don   t remember them having apples.  Peaches mostly.  Did you have a cellar?  Oh yes. Back then they kept the butter and the cream and the eggs down  in the cellar. It was my job to whenever they got ready to go to town, I  had to go down in the cellar and get a case of eggs and bring them up,  put them in the car or whatever they were driving, help load it up.  Did you have to get down in it sometimes with the weather?  Oh we weren   t too much about going to the cellar. I remember one time  we did, one or two times, when it got pretty windy and the buckets and  one thing another started blowing across the yard, and the tubs were  turning over. We kind of got scared and we went to the cellar. But  outside of that, it had to get pretty scary before we did.  Didn   t lose any property? Buildings or anything personal?  No, we didn   t. I don   t remember ever having any damage from storms.  That   s good.  That   s pretty lucky.  So on the original place, how many barns did they have?  In the early days they just probably had one.  So what does the farm do today?  Oh, just pasture and cattle on it. Just raise hay and sell the hay and have  8  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  the hay to feed the cattle in the wintertime and that   s about all we   re  doing. I   m just hay and cattle nowadays.  When you were a child, what did you do for fun?  We had a hole down there on the creek there called the round hole and  we   d usually go swimming down there about every day. (Laughter)  That sounds fun.  I fixed up a diving board where I could dive off into the deepest part of  it.  (Laughs) And how deep would that be?  Well, it would be over my head there in one place. You had to go very  far, you could just walk right out to it.  So what other water did the property have?  Well, water well. I had to pump it and carry it in a bucket to the house.  No indoor plumbing?  No indoor plumbing, no. (Laughter)  Do you remember when that came?  We got electricity in August of 19 and 48. And that   s when they put an  electric pump in the well and pump water to the house. Oh before that,  they did have a windmill that had a force pump on the windmill and they  had a tank in the building that was up overhead there and it pumped  water in that tank and it would cipher into the house. They did have  running water that way.  And how did they heat the house?  Oh way back there just with wood, I guess. Then they finally got butane,  started out butane I think. They did away with butane and it was propane  to heat the house.  So winters were pretty cold?  Yeah. And they had an old oil stove they used to cook with and had a  place on the end there for oil, put the kerosene in it and you could light  the burner off of that.  9  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  And cook your chicken.  Yeah, cook deep-fried chicken. (Laughter) Yeah, mm-hmm.  So what type of things did you do on Sunday? Did you have to work on  Sunday too?  I think so, yeah.  Had to milk cows on Sundays.  Yeah, had to feed the hogs and take care of the chickens and the cows,  milk the cows on Sunday.  And then your sister helped your mother cook?  Yes, uh-huh. I remember my dad and mother and I would go out and do  the chores and my sister would stay in the house and she   d get breakfast  for us. She   d have breakfast ready then when we got done. (Laughs)  And what would breakfast be?  Biscuits and gravy and everything good like that. Yeah. They butchered  hogs and would cure the meat and they   d have the bacon and shoulders  and the hams.  How would they keep that cold?  They would hang it up down in the cellar.  And that was good enough?  It   ll last way until the summer. In the summertime they could have that  ham. It would keep by putting it in salt, salting it down. Smoke salt.  Did they have a smokehouse?  Yeah and they kept it that way some too, in the smokehouse. My dad, he  was pretty good about curing that meat, the shoulders and the hams and  all that. Then when thrashers would come in the summertime, they   d  serve that ham and they   d just go wild over that good ham. (Laughs)  Were they part of the thrashing ring?  Yeah. There   d probably be a dozen men eat at the table, have to have  two tables to feed everybody. Maybe there   d be 15 of them, it   d be quite  10  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  a thrashing crew. The neighbors all go in together and swap work with  one another and the thrashers move around to different places.  Did you have to do some of that yourself?  Yeah, I hauled bundles with the horses. They   d pitch the bundles up on  the wagon and I   d stack them on the wagon and get way up to top it out  and then I   d go up to the thrashing machine and drive up to one of the  side of the driver   s end and pitch them in the thrashing machine.  A hard day   s work.  Yeah.  And then when did they get their first tractor?  1935. Dad bought an old Fortune tractor.  During the Depression?  Yeah. It was an old used tractor, bought it up north of Pawnee. But we  got by with that until 19 and 38 then we bought a new John Deere  tractor.  1,000 I think,  1,050 something like that for a new John Deere  tractor.  And that was a lot then wasn   t it?  (Laughs) Yeah. I think he probably traded in that old Fortune tractor  and a team of horses and give so much money to boot.  And how long did he keep that one?  I guess he had it all during the war. When I came home from the army in     45, I guess he still had it. I believe. And then wasn   t long after that we  bought a different tractor, another John Deere.  They   re supposed to run forever aren   t they?  Yeah. Through the years I had several John Deere tractors. Got two on  the place now. One of them just went down the road awhile ago.  We saw that one. Yellow and green.  Uh-huh, that   s my latest one. Yeah we got one with a cab on it with air  conditioning. Another one, it doesn   t have air. Yeah, I had a number of  different John Deere tractors. Keep them awhile, trade them off and get  11  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  a different one.  Where would you have to go to get a new one?  Pawnee. There   s a John Deere dealer at Pawnee. Cecil Kelley was the  John Deere dealer. We   ve done a lot of business with him.  Get a pretty good trade-in on a used one?  Yeah.  So you graduated from high school in     No I didn   t, I quit school in the eleventh grade.  Got close.  (Laughs) Yeah. I went    til Christmas time I think and then didn   t go  back in eleventh. It about killed my mother. She just hated it so bad.  Tried her best to get me to go on.  What did you do when you stopped?  Oh, I just helped Dad farm.  Just got tired of going.  So we just went together in the farming business.  And then you went in the military?  Yeah. I was drafted. I wouldn   t have gone but they drafted me so I had  to go. (Laughter) When I come back, well they still had some cattle and  the John Deere tractor and machinery and the land. So I just went to  farming together.  And stayed put.  Stayed put, yeah. I   ve done awful well. I   ve done awful well.  You have.  I made a little money and have saved up quite a bit. (Laughs)  The land   s been good to you then, huh?  12  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Yeah.  Do you have any idea why they chose this particular piece of land? Your  grandfather?  I don   t know. I never did hear them say why they chose it.  They had a stream going through it. That may be why.  Yeah. I bet one of them, yeah.  Over the years did you have to do any conservation efforts?  Oh yeah, with terraces. Had to build terraces and waterways and all that.  Build any ponds?  Had a number of ponds built, yeah.  Are they still around?  Yeah, mostly. Got three of them over there on the home place and about  three on this side of the road, about six ponds.  Well that   s pretty good and then the creek.  Yeah and the creek. Oh the creek has been kind of difficult to us. We   ll  have cattle that gets down in there and gets drowned and maybe they   ll  have little calves along on the creek bank and they   d get over there and  get drowned. So the old creek has cost us some money in different ways.  Hasn   t been good to us that way.  You put a fence around it?  Yeah.  When the WPA came through, did they do anything with it? The WPA in  the Roosevelt years?  No, no we didn   t. Dad didn   t sign up to have any of that kind of work  done. They built one for a neighbor up north here.The WPA built a  pond.  Did your sister live in the area or did she move away?  When she first got married, they lived four miles west of Yale down  13  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  there by the Twin Mounds. They lived there about four years. Then they  bought a place up four miles east of Glencoe and four miles west of  Lone Chimney Corner. They lived there and they had that farm until  they died.  So she didn   t mind that you kept this one?  No. After the folks died, I bought her out. I bought her share of it out.  About when did you have telephone service out here?  Probably not really good    til after the war was over, about    45, maybe     46.  The old crank.  Yeah. Before that, way back there when I was a kid the folks had phones  that had a crank on it and hoop and holler on it. (Laughs) Wasn   t very  good service. I remember the neighbors, you   d call one of them and they  had so many rings. The neighbor up here, to get his phone you had to  ring maybe two long short, two longs and then one short or something  like that or three longs and three shorts.  Kind of like Morse code?  (Laughter) Yeah, that was their number, either longs or shorts. I forget  the folks   , how many numbers they had, it   s been so long.  Did you have any pets when you were growing up?  Oh yeah, went through a lot of dogs in my lifetime.  At any point did you have to supplement the income with a second job or  anything?  No. Dad never was much of a man to work out. He just stayed to the  farm. Oh, we do custom work, done a lot of that, combining and hay  baling for other people. We did plenty of that.  Did your mother quilt?  Oh, yeah. Belonged to the club. They had quilting clubs and all. Yeah  she made a lot of quilts. Then when we settled up the estate, my sister  took most all the quilts. I didn   t get very many of them. I   ve got two or  three of them around here and they   re getting a little bit torn and ragged  now.  14  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Did she enter them in the county fair?  No, I don   t think she ever did do that. She might   ve entered some fruit  maybe or vegetables that she canned.  Jams.  Yeah.  I guess I   m just assuming they had a county fair.  Yeah way back there when I was a kid, they had a fair at Maramec. I  know Dad he would take watermelons up there and I think we won  pretty good on watermelons. (Laughs) Then after that it was to go to  Pawnee. I   ve taken stuff to Pawnee, I   ve taken watermelons. And I   ve  taken some stuff one year to the Tulsa Fair, like sweet potatoes and Irish  potatoes.  Win any prizes?  And won prizes, yeah. Won something. Sixth or seventh, maybe, place.  Hey that   s good though.  Yeah. Then I was in FFA and I was in the judging contest and I won first  in judging livestock at the Tulsa fair. (Laughs) I didn   t have much  competition though.  Judging cattle?  Yeah. Judging cattle. It was livestock.  How would you get from here to Tulsa?  The teacher of that Vo-tech, he had a car, he would haul us.  Well on Sundays did you go to church?  My folks were pretty good about going to church, but I didn   t go much. I  did some when I was younger.  And when did you get married?  I didn   t get married till 1957. I was about 40 years old.  It just took you awhile to find the right one.  15  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Yeah. And she had two children. We didn   t have any others. One of  them lives up in this house right up here now.  So they moved to the farm with you?  Well, he just came out here in the last ten years. Before that he lived in  Tulsa and he was an electrician and his wife (that was where he met her)  she   s an electrician, too. They made awful good money and saved up a  lot of money, enough that they could build a  200,000 home up there.  (Laughs)  So the land is in his name now?  I just deeded it to him. They didn   t pay me anything.  What will happen to it in the next 100 years? Does he have children?  Yeah, he has a daughter and she has two children. Then his wife has a  daughter and a son and the wife   s daughter, she had twins the other day,  a little boy and a little girl over in Tulsa.  So there   ll be plenty to keep it.  They were born several weeks before time. Then the little girl had to  have heart surgery the other day but come out of it okay. So far she   s  making it all right. They just weighed two pounds apiece.  Just little.  I was talking to them this morning, said both of them have been gaining  a little weight.  Technology   s great, isn   t it?  Yeah, they   re feeding them with tubes in their mouths, put a tube in their  mouth. I guess that   s where they get their nourishment.  I read where you   ve had a lot of twin calves on this farm.  Oh yeah, since I got home from the army in    45 we probably had about a  dozen   no, 15 probably. Fifteen sets of calves.  Is that unusual?  We had a set this year.  16  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  That seems like a lot.  Yeah, 15 sets or probably now 16. I had a picture of all of them and I  gave it to Mary to keep and now she claims she gave them back to me.  Well, if she gave them back to me, I can   t find them anywhere. So I  think she   s got them with her and just misplaced them. Or else she threw  them in the trash and I hope she hasn   t. I tried my best to keep them  together all these years. Yeah. I   ve got a picture book there with some of  the twin calves.  It just seems like that   s unusual for one farm to have that many, isn   t it?  I guess so. But we raised a lot of alfalfa hay and I fed them good.  (Laughter) That   s my mother and Dad.  Good old overalls.  Yeah. And then that   s my wife, Frieda, and that   s my sister Ruby, and  that   s her son, Rex, and that   s his wife. And that   s my brother. David,  that   s Rick   s son. And Dad. And Cheryl. There   s a John Deere tractor.  That   s a big one.  Mm-hmm. Oh, here   s some twin calves. It looks like the same cow, but  they   re different.  Their markings are a little bit different. So how many cows would you  have at one time?  Oh, way back there after my folks died, on both sides of the road here I  had around 150 to 190 head of cattle, calves and all.  A lot to keep up with.  (Laughs) Yeah. Probably had 50 cows maybe.  And when it was time to take them to market, how would you take them?  I had a truck with sideboards on it and hauled them in a truck for a long  time. And before that, we usually hired somebody that had a truck to  haul them. We had a trailer that we hauled our hogs in, but we didn   t try  to haul the cattle in that.  And where would you take them?  Tulsa. Sand Springs.  17  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  And then they   d get on a train and go to a stockyard?  Yeah they would   they   d go back to the country if anybody wanted  them as feeders. If they were butchered, there were little packing plants  all around Tulsa and Sand Springs that would buy them from the  butcher. Here   s the old tractor they had during the war. That was the first  one we bought.  It looks like they   re thrashing there?  I think they   re baling hay. That   s a picture of the old house. Yeah, that   s  my grandfather and that   s Mother   s sister. That   s her brother right there  and this is her mother. I guess that   s my mother. My mother, yeah. I  think Aunt Grace is eight years older and I think he was about 20 or 21  years older than my mother. (Laughs) There was some other children  born in between there but they died. That was back when they couldn   t  save them like they can now.  That   s a good looking family.  Mm-hmm. Well, there should   ve been another   I guess, there was  another one that was five years younger than my mother, but I guess she  hadn   t been born yet. Aunt Francis, she wasn   t in the picture.  Did your aunts come to visit on the farm?  Yeah, they lived up in Pawnee.  Oh they didn   t have to come too far then.  My grandmother had property in Maramec. After he  grandfather   died   he died when I was four days old. I was born the 15th and he died  the 19th of December. He was only 63 years old. Then my grandmother,  she bought property there in Maramec then in a few years and lived up  here and she died then 19 and 29 at Maramec at 72 years old.  And are they buried in Maramec?  Yeah, at Maramec Cemetery.  We passed one coming. Tin types  looking at photographs .  Well, there   s me and my pet pig. (Laughs)  It   s just a little thing.  18  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Yeah.  So if he was your pet      The runt. The old sow wasn   t feeding it too good and I had to take it and  raise it myself. But usually it   d wind up that something would happen to  it though. I never could get it to grow clear out. (Laughter) Want to see  that other one?  It was newer.  Oh and that   s my stepson there. This was taken down at Fort Sill at that  reservation out there on Fort Sill. That was him and his wife there. Have  you met her?  No.  She works for the railroad at Tulsa. She   s up on the job now. She goes to  work at 2:30 and gets off at 10:30.  2:30 in the morning or 2:30 in the afternoon?  Afternoon, yeah. She maybe works that way for awhile until she gets  bumped. They bump one another in there and they have to get a different  job every   it   ll still be the railroad, the same kind of work, but there   s  different hours. They get bumped on that. She got bumped here not long  ago.  Well did the railroad used to come through here?  Yeah. Right back of my place here.  It did?  That old track, uh-huh.  What line, do you know?  Santa Fe.  Santa Fe. Is the track still there?  No, they cleaned it up, removed it.  Just the bed?  19  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Yeah, just the old bed and I let it grow over with the cedar trees.  So when you were younger it was going back and forth?  Yeah.  Did you ever hop on it?  No. No I never did hop on it.  No hobos hopped off?  I think the folks maybe did have a little trouble with people   men kind  of being hobos. Not so much though.  Probably just in the    30s when times were tough.  Yeah.  That looks like a pretty new tractor.  Yeah, yeah that   s the latest one. That   s the one without the cab. That  was pretty new then.  I see you   re trying it out there.  Mm-hmm. Yeah, that was at the dealer   s place. That   s for trying it out,  that   s right. Yeah that   s the guy that sold it to us.  So today the farm is still raising cattle and hay.  Yeah.  And you   re supervising.  Yeah.  I read somewhere that back in the    20s or so that Yale even had a  hospital.  Yes, that   s right. It was still probably in operation when the war  World  War II  was over with. But I don   t think it lasted long after that.  So if you got sick, the doctor just came to you when you were younger?  I remember I had to have an appendicitis operation. My mother called  20  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  the doctor and he came from Pawnee out here. As soon as the doctor saw  me and checked me he said,    You   re going to Pawnee.    So he loaded me  up in his car, and my mother too, and we rode with him up to Pawnee.  And he operated on it just right away. My appendix had already burst,  had to get it out of there because of gangrene.  Sure. But the doctor made a home visit.  Yeah.  That doesn   t happen much anymore.  No.  So is the old house still standing?  Yeah.  The one that was built in 1909?  Yeah, it was built onto it. The old north side is the old, old part and then  they built on the west and on the south and made it larger.  Did they live in it?  Yeah. Mm-hmm.  And in the paperwork, they said there was a wash house. What was a  wash house? Where you did laundry?  Yeah, Mother had an old Maytag washing machine out there.  Okay. A ringer.  She washed her clothes with that old Maytag washing machine. You had  to crank it with your foot you know and get it started, to wash the  clothes.  Huh. Haven   t seen one of those. And it   s still standing.  Yeah, that wash house is.  So at one time was all 80 acres fenced in?  Yeah, my dad just farmed 80 acres and the 40 on the west of it. That   s  all he had there and Uncle John had this north 80. Then he sold out, him  21  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  and his wife went to Colorado. He rented it out to a neighbor up north  and he farmed it for awhile. So Dad never was a very big farmer, didn   t  spread out or try to do too much.  And then neighbors helped neighbors.  Yeah. That   s what the old house looked like when they first built it. It  had two rooms downstairs and one upstairs. The bedroom was upstairs.  That   s Ruby, my sister. I wasn   t born yet. So that must   ve been taken  about    13 or    14.  It had three doors? Or at least two.  Yeah, maybe it did. Maybe it did have two doors.  That   s a neat picture.  Mm-hmm. And then there   s the rest of it down there, the way it looked  like today.  So this is still there. Not too many windows.  (Laughs) No.  Did the snow blow in on you from the roof? Do you remember?  I don   t remember that, no.  Must   ve been a pretty good roof then.  (Laughs) Yeah. You want to see the other one? That   s an aerial picture  of us.  Okay, the pond.  I don   t know where the old house is at.  I don   t know unless that may be   well this looks like a house here, it  looks like right there. That   s the top part.  Yeah. I guess that   s it.  Looks like they may   ve added a window or two on the second floor.  Yeah.  22  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  So on here, where are we today? Over here?  Yes, uh-huh.  On this side.  I don   t know whether I   m going to make it very much longer or not. I  ought to be in a nursing home. (Laughs)  Oh no, you   re doing great. You   re doing great. So how has farming  changed besides equipment?  Well, we used to raise alfalfa and corn for the hogs. Now it   s just hay  and cattle. We don   t try to harvest anything, only just the hay   bale the  hay, round bale it and we still square bale some of it.  Mostly to feed the cattle that you have?  Yeah and if we have any extra hay, we sell it. And rest of it we just feed  to the cattle and the calves. Then we have to buy feed   pellets,  supplement feed, a protein feed. Feed that in the wintertime when I go to  town at the  grain  elevator and buy that.  And manage     Or we used to have the alfalfa, we didn   t have to go to town and buy that  protein feed. Because alfalfa had a lot of protein in it. Then when we  were feeding alfalfa, the cows would get fat on it if they ate too much,  didn   t give too much of it.  But you just don   t grow it now?  Had to quit on account of the alfalfa weevil. Alfalfa weevil came in the  country and you got to spray it now or you won   t grow it. They   ll eat it  up if you don   t spray it. So much trouble to spray it, we just quit  growing it. A lot of them are still growing it though up on the river, on  the Arkansas and Black Bear on that good land. They   re still growing it  but they have to spray it.  Crop dust it?  Yeah.  So are you pretty much able to make ends meet with what you do?  Yeah. It was pretty pleasant to raise alfalfa back then before that alfalfa  23  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  weevil came. It was a nice crop to raise. You could always sell it too and  make good money selling it.  Well I   ve about asked all of my questions. Is there something else you  might want to add? Would you do it again?  Ahh.  You chuckle.  Oh I   d live my life a little different I guess.  But you   d still stay on the land?  I   d still stay on the land, yeah. I like that part of it.  The land   s been good to you.  Yeah, the oil companies have been pretty good about leasing the land,  getting some lease money. Royalty I had on them.  Did they find any oil?  There   s one oil well down there yet that   s been producing since    82.  On your property?  Yeah.  That   s lucky too, isn   t it?  Yeah. I even have gas off of the oil well to heat my house. I don   t have  to buy propane.  Well that   s even better.  (Laughs) Yeah, I went all winter and I haven   t had to switch it. I   ve got  it fixed where I can switch it to propane if they have trouble with the  well, but so far this winter I haven   t had to make switches. I had my  tank, propane tank, filled up and I haven   t burnt up any of it. If it hasn   t  leaked off, well it   s still got it all. (Laughs)  The winter wasn   t too bad this year.  No.  24  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Wingo  Finchum  Well then that   s pretty good.  Yeah. Yeah.  We appreciate you talking to us today.  Well, hope I haven   t made a mess of it. (Laughs)  No, you   ve done fine.  -------  -------
