 Finchum  Kalka  This is March 12, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University Library and we   re conducting an Oral History Project  called    Centennial Farm Families.    Today  Juliana Nykolaiszyn and I   are in Chandler, Oklahoma with Louberta Kalka and we   re going to be  talking about the Beasler Farm. Thank you for having us today.  You   re welcome. My great-grand, Captain Adolf August Beasler was  born June 2, 1841 along the Rhine River in Kaiserwerth, Prussia,  Germany. He deserted the German army and then immigrated to  America at New Orleans. He then enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 to  help free the slaves. After the Civil War, he returned to New Orleans and  married Henrietta Brotherton in 1865. To this marriage was born eleven  children. Henrietta died at a young age of forty-three years. After her  death in 1892, Captain Beasler came to Oklahoma with his family and  settled in Lincoln County by staking a claim in the Kickapoo Land  opening May 23, 1895. His eldest son, William A. Beasler, acquired the  final receipt on May 19, 1903 for the 160 acres. Description of land is  the southeast quarter of section four in township thirteen, range three,  east of the Indian Meridian at Guthrie from William F. Young, receiver.  My grandfather, Charles A. Beasler, was born December 8, 1875. He  married Harriett Anne Bruce May 19, 1904 and they lived on the  Speilberger place. It was on the Speilberger place that Louis Emil  Beasler was born August 24, 1905. On February 28, 1905, my  grandmother, Harriett A. Beasler acquired eighty acres. Description of  land is the west half of southeast quarter of section four in township  thirteen, range east from William A. and Ada Beasler, husband and wife.  This land became their home and my grandfather and grandmother had  three more children: Homer, Wanda, and Verona. Homer died as a child.  My father, Louis Emil Beasler, helped his dad, Charles A. Beasler, care  for the farm. The animals consisted of cattle, hogs, horses, chickens,  dogs, and cats. Garden and field crops provided food for both the family  5  and the livestock.  As my dad grew to manhood, he married Bertha May Gilliam on  February 22, 1927. They made their home on the Francis Pool place, just  across the road, east of his parent   s farm and lived in a two-story house.  It was there six children were born: Florence in 1928, Margaret in 1930,  Homer in 1933, Louberta in 1935, Berniece in 1938, Alfred in 1939. The  Pool place later became the Matilda and Ed Kohlhorst place. My father,  Louis E. Beasler, acquired the eighty acres from his parents, Charles A.  and Harriett. Beasler, on August 27, 1940. My grandparents moved to  Chandler and lived on Eighth Street.  I remember as a young child moving from our house to the farm in a  wagon and a team of horses. The farmhouse was a four roomed house:  kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms and a small back porch. We had a  potbelly, wood burning stove in the dining room to heat the house. We  used a cross cut saw to cut the wood up in stove links. In time, Dad  acquired a buzz saw and it made it a lot easier to cut the wood and much  faster, too. We had a    Home Comfort    cook stove with reservoirs on  either side to keep water warm. Mother stood over this stove many long  hours making meals and canning food for the winter. She was a happy  person, always humming, whistling and had a smile for everyone.  Our sister Bernice was born with spina bifida. She was an invalid and  very smart. I was my mother   s right hand person in helping her with  cooking, house duties, gardening, canning, and by the time I was  fourteen, I could cook a complete meal for our family. My oldest sister,  Florence, stayed in town with Grandma during her early childhood and  through high school. I don   t remember her being at home on the farm.  Outside of the farmhouse was rough wood and down through the years,  Dad built a living room, three bedrooms onto the house and a little side  porch by the living room to store wood. He covered the outside of the  house with asbestos siding. It was so good to have more room. We girls  would decorate our own bedroom and paint our iron bed stands to our  liking. We had no electric or indoor plumbing. We used coal oil lamps  for light and one day Dad came home with an Aladdin lamp and it was  hard to believe how much more light it gave off. It was in the early  1950s when we got electricity.  We had a crank telephone with a handle on the side of the phone. Each  family had their own ring. This is how we made contact with the party  we were calling and when they answered, we had to holler for them to  hear because of the roar that was on the line. A lot of times, there were  several parties listening in on your conversation. So nothing was secret  and news traveled fast. We ironed with wood heated irons. We kept the  irons on the wood cook stove to keep them hot. When one cooled, we  6  would exchange for a hotter one. We graduated to a gas heated iron  which we had to pump and light. It had a blue flame and kept the iron  hot. This iron was quite a treat, but the greatest was when we got  electricity and an electric iron. We had no refrigerator. We had an  icebox that we kept blocks of ice that the delivery man brought to us  once a week. We would cool our milk down in cold well water. We had  a separator that separated the cream from the milk. We churned our own  butter. Dad sold cream and eggs to help buy staples and feed.  We heated our water in a big iron kettle on legs outside for the clothes  washing. We washed our clothes with a rub board. It took a lot of  muscle and perspiration, and you almost wound up with flesh off of your  knuckles. (Laughs) We used the bar soap Mom had made with lard and  lye in the big iron kettle. We finally got a Maytag washer with a ringer  and two rinse tubs on a stand. We used bluing in the rinse water to make  white clothes look whiter. We also used the lye soap for bathing in a  number two tub by the woodstove. Several kids took baths in the same  water.  Our family saw a lot of hard times and good times. We managed to  survive through the Great Depression, the drought, and World War II.  My dad worked for the WPA in his early married life. I remember we  were issued mills and tokens to buy sugar and flour during the war. Life  was all about family togetherness rather than worldly possessions. Our  farm was our survival. We raised most everything we ate. We would  have fresh fried squirrel, rabbit and frog legs now and then and it all  tasted so good. Springtime was a busy time. We would all help plant  corn, beans, Irish potatoes, onions and some of the little seed. Mom was  up early working in the garden before we kids got up. Our garden  consisted of English peas, radishes, onions, lettuce, turnips, cabbage,  tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, cantaloupe and watermelons.  Some vegetables we planted in bigger lots for canning. We had an  orchard with apple, peach, pear and apricot trees. We would go to the  woods and pick wild blackberries when in season. We also had some  pecan trees and some of the field crops were kaffir corn and corn for  grain and fodder.  We butchered two hogs in winter and I can still see them hanging in the  tree for cooling. Daddy cured our meat and stored it in the smokehouse.  Mother fried the sausage and then packed it into jars and poured hot  grease over the sausage. She put caps and rings on the jars and turned  the jars upside down to seal the canned sausage. Mother used the hog  meat off of the head to make mincemeat, later used for pies.  Some of the buildings on the farm were the outdoor toilet where we used  the old Sears, Montgomery Ward, and JC Penny catalogs. A chicken  7  house, a cellar for storing canned goods and protection from storms. A  storage building and feed room for chickens, a two story log barn. The  hay was stored in the loft and stanchions for one side of the barn for  milking and some log corrals around the barn. Dad always had a team of  horses and mules to pull the machinery for planting and cultivating. We  children were glad when these pieces of machinery came to the farm  because it kept us from hoeing so much. Our livestock consisted of  cattle, chicken, hogs, sheep, horses, dogs and cats. Sometimes a goat to  fatten for butchering to provide meat for our family. Daddy was a very  loving father. He taught us responsibility, morals, and how to work.  Whatever he set his mind to do, he accomplished. He picked up skills  easily and did a good job. He was a communicator and was always  willing to help his neighbors.  Our family continued to grow. I remember in 1941 after midnight, we  kids had to get up and go to the neighbor friend. I asked why and my  sister told me we were getting a little baby. In those days, people used  midwives and she delivered my brother Hershel; my sister Phyllis in  1944. The last babies that were born were identical twins, Marilyn and  Carolyn, born in 1948 at Dr. Smith   s office in Chandler. The young  children had light chores to do such as gathering the kindling for starting  the fire, learning to sweep floors, make the beds, running errands and  feeding and watering the cats and dogs. My mother had a way of  refreshing herself when she was alone. She kept her harmonica in the  kitchen and played    When the Saints Go Marching In.    Some of the  most memorable times with our family is when we gathered ourselves  around the piano and entertained ourselves with singing. Music was a  natural art in our family.  A lot of reminiscing and laughter went on amongst us. During those  special times, we always had a freezer of homemade ice cream. We  loved and appreciated our family. Our Sunday was a day of rest. We  went to church and had a dinner of fried chicken, fresh garden  vegetables, homemade bread, cake and Jell-O. My Mother was a bread  maker. She made bread twice a week. We knew of no other bread except  biscuits, cornbread and pancakes. Sometimes she would treat us to her  cinnamon rolls. Many times when we would be walking up the road to  our house from school, we could smell the fresh baked bread and  couldn   t wait to have a slice with butter. I can still smell it. My sister  Margaret picked up the skill of bread making.  Our mode of transportation in early days was buggy and horse, a Model  A vehicle. And in 1949, Dad bought a new Chevrolet pick-up. In those  days, kids could ride in the back. Our roads were red mud when it  rained. The red clay would mud up on the tires until it touched the  fender. During the 1940s and early 1950s, Dad was able to buy the 160  8  acre Pool farm. The legal description was the southwest quarter of  section three, township thirteen, range three, east of the Indian Meridian  and the 160 acre Frederick Bakes farm, legal description, the northwest  quarter of section ten, township thirteen, range three, east of the Indian  Meridian. Both of these 160 acres joined our land. He also purchased the  remaining acres of our farm which was the east half of the southeast  quarter of section four, township thirteen, range three, east of the Indian  meridian. This made a total of 480 acres for our family. Cattle was his  first love, then hard times hit in the early    70s and he had to cut down on  his cattle and he sold the two 160 acres described as the Francis Pool  place and the Frederick Bakes place. And then he sold forty acres each  to his sons Alfred and Hershel and Dad was back to the original eighty  acres for his family.  My mother Bertha had the onset of dementia and in 1976 Dad purchased  and moved into a house in Chandler close to his parents, Charles and  Harriett Beasler. Dad   s sister Wanda lived with her parents and was  taking care of them. She also checked on my mother since Dad still had  livestock on the farm. One son, Alfred Beasler and his family, moved to  the farmhouse in 1976 and lived there until 1978. They moved into their  new home in 1978 on the forty acres he had purchased from Dad. One  daughter, Marilyn Stancill, and her husband Wayne lived in the  farmhouse from 1981 to 1988. Wayne graduated from OSU while living  there. Another daughter, Carolyn Hancock, moved a trailer on the farm  in 1987 and was there until 2006. Dad maintained his livestock until  1996 and had to sell them. My mother was killed in a car accident in  1989.  Some of my dad   s conservation efforts were terracing through the years,  building two ponds, getting the land back into grasses that would hold  the soil. When the children grew up and married, nine of them landed on  farms and followed in the family heritage. The smell of a gentle rain  after a hot summer day, the smell of a fresh plowed field and the  peacefulness on the farm cannot be taken away from me. Mother and  Daddy celebrated their sixty-second wedding anniversary before Mother  was killed. Dad was mentally alert at ninety-six-and-a-half and went to  join Mother on April 19, 2002.  In 2006, five children sold their acreage of fifty-seven-plus acres to a  couple that fell in love with the place. It had a lot more timber and brush  at this time and that is what they loved. There have been twelve family  members that had worked on the farm and we had a stationary baler  crew of four members at one time, and we girls did men   s work. Our  family consisted of seven girls and three boys.  Dad was involved in the country school called Happy Hill. He graduated  9  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  from the eighth grade there as well as all of us children. Our community  fun time at our school was our box pie supper. We girls would all take a  box in hopes that the right boy or man would purchase it. We would  have to eat with them. The proceeds went to buy candy and fruit for our  Christmas sack treats. All children except two graduated from Chandler  High School. One girl went to one year of college and another girl had  two years of college.  One of the things I remember my grandmother telling us about was  when the Dalton gang came by and said,    Do as we say, and no one will  get hurt. Give us a meal and a place to stay for the night and we will be  on our way in the morning.     Home remedies were lard and sulfur, which cured the itch, coal oil for  soaking your foot when stepping on a rusty nail, soap and sugar poultice  would draw infection out of a wound. We had an old mare called Ribbon  and we children could hang onto her anywhere and she never hurt us.  We would pile on her and if she thought we were about to fall she would  stop. Farming is very important to existence. No land, no food.  So you   re father got the land and was born in 1905?  Yes.  And then the land stayed in the family until 2006?  Right, and  twenty-three-plus acres  of the land are still in the family.  Two girls still have theirs. They didn   t want to sell.  And a partial is fifty     Fifty-seven-plus acres  is what we sold . Each one of us seven children   was deeded the eighty acres  and two of the boys had the forty acres  that Dad had sold and given them a good price on.  Do you have an idea of why they chose that particular piece of property  to begin with?  No, I really don   t. I just figured that it was time for acquiring some  property and     And the layout of the land at that point was the house and a barn?  In the early times, back whenever Grandma and then Grandpa would  come   I mean my grandpa, which is Charlie A. Beasler and then my  dad, I   m sure they put more buildings on it.  10  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  And then the main source of water was     Well water. We had our own well that was drilled. Or had a well.  Did you have a windmill?  No, we didn   t. It was a big old long-handled pump and we would get out  there with a bucket for water and we   d pump that bucket full and run  back in the house and that was our drinking water and the water that we  used.  And he went to Happy Valley     Happy Hills School. He graduated out of the eighth grade there. All of  us children, except my invalid sister, went to Happy Hill. We graduated  out of the eighth grade. All but my invalid sister and one of my brothers,  he never did finish high school. He went to high school, but he didn   t  finish. He was one of the children that served in the Army. He was in the  U.S. Army.  About how many children would be in a classroom in this little school?   About sixteen to twenty-five students. It would vary from year to year.   Actually, in my time there, it was just another boy and I were the only  ones throughout our grades except when we got some new teachers and  they had children and maybe would be in our class. And then we had a  family that at one time moved in the community and they had a girl in  our class, but for the rest of the time it was just he and I.  And how far did you have to go? Did you walk?  Yes, it was right at a mile to school and many days, my brother and I  would cut through the pasture and we would take off from the house and  we would start running and we would jump the fences. We never slowed  down, we would just jump the fences and on we   d go. (Laughs) And it  was quite fun because a lot of times we   d say,    Which one is going to  get to school faster?    (Laughs)  When my brother and I were in high school, we had to go a little over a  mile to get to the bus and so the first two years we rode a horse and we   d  cut across the pastures. This one farm, the Pool place I was talking  about, we   d cut across that and went right straight east to the next  section over there and left our horse at a neighbor   s house that we knew  real well and caught the school bus over there and went on to school.  Then got off the school bus there and rode the horse back home.  11  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Then our last two years, we had a little horse with a buggy or kind of a  little wagon with a hack up front and we were going one morning that it  had rained that night. This horse had her harness on so she could pull the  buggy, the wagon, and she stepped on a slick spot and she went down,  her feet went out from under her and the wagon lunged like that and my  brother went clear over the top of the horse   Talk a little bit about what holidays were like back in the early days.  Oh, holidays   we hardly knew about any except Christmas and  Christmas was a big meal. We did have a tree. The gifts were very  sparse. Not very many, but we always had an orange and an apple. We  always had fruit and a little bit of candy and actually, as far as gifts,  there was none when I was a real young child. Now as I got older and  there were younger children, there was more gifts.  And what would the meal be?  The meal would be chicken and ham and if there was sweet potatoes     usually Irish potatoes because we raised a lot of Irish potatoes. We had a  lot of mashed potatoes for our meals and that was one of the big staples,  and gravy and whatever vegetables, like corn and green beans that  Mother had canned.  She had a large garden.  Oh yes, and we canned a lot. We canned a lot of green beans, a lot of  corn, a lot of pickles   made a lot of pickles out of the cucumbers and  beets and English peas.  How would she have learned how to can? Had her mother taught her or  do you know?  Well, I   m sure part of that and part of my grandmother   she was a  canner and she had a pressure cooker and she passed it down to my  mother. I can see it setting on the stove now with these seven jars in it  and you just had to stand right there to make sure that that handle on the  pressure cooker didn   t go up or down, you know. You made sure it  stayed at the right temperature.  Did county agents come to the farm?  No.  Like home demonstration agents?  12  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  We didn   t know anything about county agents until I was married and  getting on up in years and I joined a home demonstration club and did a  lot of canning when we were in a club. Each club had a name and we  would put up displays at the county fair and display our canning and our  sewing and various things like that.  And what was the name of your club?  New Zion.  Does it still exist?  It does, but it doesn   t carry on New Zion; it   s just more of a social time  that they meet together.  And you had mentioned that your mother canned meat?  Yes, this was quite unusual that sausage would stay preserved in the jar,  but there   s something about it. She would pack it in the jars when it was  hot when she just got through frying it and it was all cooked. She would  take that hot grease and pour it over the top and usually we would have  about a half a jar of grease and put the lid on and turn it upside down and  it would seal and the meat was preserved. You   d just go get a jar   it was  a quart   of sausage and dump it in the skillet and we   d warm it up and  then the grease is what we   d make gravy with and sausage and biscuits  and gravy. Breakfast, supper   can   t be beat  (Laughter) I can just see all  of those things. I mean when I wrote this, I was there as a little girl  growing up and, of course, as I got older I knew how to do a lot of things  with Mom.  And you mentioned your father worked for the WPA for a little awhile?  Yes.  What in particular did he do?  Well, it was hard times and he needed some extra money and, of course,  he would tell that he would work for like fifty cents a day. I mean that  was what his wages were   about fifty cents a day. He drove to the city  and I don   t know how long he worked, but I guess in those days that was  a pretty good sum of money.  Through the years he needed supplemental income, not just one source.  Yes.  13  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Did he have hired help?  No, he didn   t. All of us kids learned how to work on the farm and we  just picked it up; what needed to be done we just did it. You don   t say,     Why?    You don   t say,    I   m not going to.    You just do it. (Laughs) And  it gave us responsibility and we learned how to use that in our lives  when we got older.  Did you have particular chores that you were assigned specifically?  I helped Mother in the house an awful lot even though I had to go work  in the field, but whenever I came in I would help Mother. You know, I  spoke about a sister that had spina bifida when she was born and she was  the girl right after me. Mother needed help because she was an invalid,  and it was just like taking care of a baby, you know. She was paralyzed  from her waist down. And so I just picked up on everything and, you  know, when you separate milk you   ve got the separator to wash and then  all of the cream cans when you dump up the cream, in the can that you  take it to town in to sell. Then you have all of those things to wash up  and the floors to be mopped and swept and the washing to be done.  (Laughs) So I pretty well just fell right in that area and just helped  Mother because I was the one that instigated getting the washing started.  And what did you do for fun when you were doing all this work?  Well, we enjoyed ourselves. We neighbor kids would sometimes get  together in the evening. Sometimes the neighbors would come by and  they all had big families; some of them had nine or ten children alike  like we did. They   d come up and we   d play Annie Over, Hide and Go  Seek. Of course, when we were in school we   d play jump rope, jacks,  red rover, just a lot of games and we just busied ourselves doing all these  things and we enjoyed ourselves.  And was there church involved?  Yes. We didn   t come into Chandler to church until about the middle-forties  or early fifties maybe. We went to a little church that was called  Rossville and we went to Sunday school and then they had a service  there and that was our church time when we were out there. And then  when Dad bought the new Chevrolet, why we   d come into town. My  grandmother helped start the Friend   s Church, or the Quaker church, in  Chandler. So I guess through her being involved there, why we came in  there. We went to church there, that was on the old sandstone building  on Eighth street and the building right across from it was the  Presbyterian church, and it survived the tornado that hit Chandler in I  want to say 1906, but I could be wrong. So we went to church there all  14  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  the time I was in high school and then we did get a new church which is  down on  Highway  18 there.  And after the church service, you   d come and do what on a Sunday  afternoon?  Oh, we   d get dinner. We always had fried chicken, mashed potatoes and  gravy and fresh vegetables and homemade bread and anytime we would  go to the neighbors and go to the schoolhouse we   d ride our horse up  there and other kids would congregate and we   d play ball and  sometimes, we got in a horse race. I remember one time Dad said,    Now  I don   t want that horse to be run hard.    I didn   t know why. (Laughs) So  we did do some racing and when we would come home she was all  sweaty and Dad came out to take the saddle off and he said,    You   ve  been in a horse race. I told you not to run this horse.    But he didn   t give  me a whippin   , he gave me a real bad scolding and I   d rather get a  whippin    than a scolding from my dad. (Laughs) That taught me a lesson  and she was with colt and of course, you know, just being young I  wasn   t thinking. But we always had a fun time.  Well you mentioned discipline, so was there     I   ll have to sit here and tell you, I don   t ever remember a whippin    from  my dad. I have seen a few whippings that some of the children have  gotten from Dad, but I don   t remember one myself unless I got one  when I was real young and I don   t remember. My first remembrance was  about five years old when I first started school. When we moved to the  farmhouse, I was about five or maybe just a little over five when we  moved in the buggy, in the wagon and the horse that moved us down to  the farmhouse.  And initially the house was heated with wood?  Yes.  Did the heat make it to your bedroom?  No. The house was closed off to bedrooms. When we got ready to go to  bed, we would go get one of those irons that set on the woodstove and  we would wrap it in one of these brown paper bags and put a small towel  around it and take it to our bed so it would keep our feet warm, put our  feet on it, because we didn   t have rugs. We had linoleum on our floors  and they could get awfully cold.  And at the time you said that there was an outhouse.  15  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Yes, there was an outdoor toilet.  Well with that many children you had to share rooms, share beds?  Yes ma   am, we did. Many times, two slept in a bed and sometimes three  if they was little. After Dad built on three more bedrooms, we had  sometimes two children in a bed, but as they grew older they   d be out on  their own or they   d be somewhere else working and then we   d get to  have a bed by ourselves. But normally, I remember my older sister and I  sleeping together.  The original farmhouse had a kitchen, and how many rooms before your  father built onto it?  It had a kitchen, a dining room, two bedrooms and a back porch.  And had he built this himself or     No, it was through his grandpa and his dad. Now I don   t know which  built it, but it was a building that was built on the land when they settled  on it.  What was the porch used for?  The porch? Well this back porch was where we went out the backdoor to  go get the well water. Of course, it was all encased. It wasn   t open or  anything and we   d come through the door and eventually part of it was  used at one time as a bedroom because there was an opening from one of  the other bedrooms there, a pretty good-sized opening that was used as a  bedroom. But then after we got more space then it was more or less used  as a back porch where you kept the separator and a lot of other things  out there.  After you graduated from high school, take us through what happened  next with you.  Well, I graduated from Chandler High School in 1953 and I went to  work at the B M Cleaners in Chandler. I worked there probably about a  year or so and then I went to work for Southwestern Bell Telephone and  that was the days where you said,    Number please.    You plugged your  jack into the number and you   d pull it and ring it. And I also worked at  nighttime too and we had to grade our own tickets. When people made  long distance calls at nighttime, whatever girl worked at night graded all  the tickets and plus answering for the phone to give the party their  number. I was working there when my husband   well I   ll tell you about  whenever I met my husband.  16  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  When I worked there, nighttimes got awfully long and sometimes we  would call the man that worked at the filling station, Lucien Nichols was  his name, and visit with him for awhile. One evening I was talking to  him and he said,    I   ve got somebody here I want you to meet. I   ll put  him on the line.    And this was Kenneth Kalka, which became my  husband. I visited with him for a little while and we were never  supposed to open the door to anyone, but sometimes we would get the  police officer to bring us down a hamburger. Well Lucien promised me  it would be okay for Kenneth to bring me this hamburger. He was  already in his business. He had Kalka Feed Store north of town, him and  his dad built it and he had been grinding hay that day and mixing feed  for customers and things. He hadn   t been home, and when you do that,  you get this feed dust all over you and everything.  Well he brought my hamburger down there and needless to say, I just  barely cracked the door and took it and I looked at him (laughs) and then  he did ask me if he could see me or make a date with me and, of course,  after we talked a little more on the telephone, I did agree. He wanted me  to meet his folks and he brought me out here to meet his folks. And of  course, his mother was a Czech and she was a very good cook and his  dad was German, I mean their backgrounds were German. He had had  some pictures while he was in the Korean War and he showed me those  and his mom had made an apple pie and she brought me a piece of apple  pie with ice cream on it, you know. It was just delicious. It just kind of  went from there and blossomed and so we married March 31, 1956, and  we got to see fifty years of blessed marriage. Actually, he passed away  March 30, 2008, so we actually had fifty-two years of marriage  together   we had two more years. That was our time.  We would do courtin    you know, and he would take me out to a farm up  here that had a big old pond on it and show me the pond and everything  and sometimes we   d go skating and I always told him, I said,    Well we  went skating when Stroud had a skating rink over there.    I couldn   t skate  very good and he really couldn   t skate very good either. (Laughs) So we  were skating along there and I don   t know what happened, we would  just go around this curve and whammo, we went down on the floor, and  I always told him,    That must have been our jolt from when we fell in  love or something     (Laughs) We   ve had our ups and downs like any  marriage would, but we managed to stay together and I   m thankful for it.  And it   s on the farm?  Yes.  So you went from growing up on a farm to     17  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Being on a farm. But his farm. We moved into that house up there,  which was part of this farm because his dad lived here and his dad   s  mother lived up there. And both of these houses were built in the same  year, 1927.  Both are on Route 66. Do you have any stories to tell about that?  Oh my, my brain doesn   t bring anything up right now. There might be  when I start thinking about the Kalka history because we lived there all  of our   well we lived in town almost two years, maybe three years,  because our first baby was born in town and I was pregnant with my  second baby when we moved out here in Grandma   s house.  So how many children do you have?  I have three living. We had four girls.  And are three still around the area?  Yes. My third daughter lives up here. My baby daughter lives a mile up  here, north of us. And then my oldest daughter lives in Madill   Oklahoma . Our second daughter was killed in 1983.  And do they farm?  Well, no. The one that lives in Madill, she lives in town and she runs a  laundry mat. My daughter and her husband up west of me, he works in  the oil field and she wants to start a garden, but she hasn   t had time. Her  little daughter would love to have a garden because she likes to gather  produce, and she likes the fresh garden produce, too. The daughter up   north one mile , they both work. Maybe eventually they both will begin  to do a little more. She has two boys and a girl and they   re pretty much  all grown. Her youngest daughter is a senior in high school this year and  as soon as things kind of quiet down, there might be a little more time to  do things.  So you grow a garden big enough for all of them?  Not really. It   s kind of strange. All of my girls grew up not liking fresh  tomatoes. They liked ketchup, the juice and sauce to cook with, but they  don   t like fresh tomatoes   sliced tomatoes. Since they don   t like them,  their kids don   t eat them. So what you don   t teach your children, they   re  not going to eat. (Laughs) But they do like the fresh vegetables. Now  this daughter up here says,    Mother, when you had your garden       and I  did have a big garden. I had probably over an acre and I raised a lot of  sweet corn. She said,    I can   t find any sweet corn that   s like your corn  18  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  that you raised.    I said,    I know, I can   t either.    So I put in a little bit of  sweet corn this last summer and I had two rows on this side of the fence  and two rows on the other side of the fence because I don   t have a big  enough spot out here. I gathered it and boiled it and cooked it on the ear  and she said,    Mother, this tastes like what you used to raise.    And I  said,    It   s the same identical corn.    (Laughter) I   m going to put some  more out this year and see what it will do.  Are you going to freeze it?  Well what I made was just enough for like when we had a family  gathering. I   d say,    Okay, I   m going to cook some corn. Ya   ll come.     And so they did, but I could probably put up a hot wire going down this  way and use a little more of that land out there where I   ve got my  garden. I can take you out and show you my garden. It   s very small, but  I don   t can anymore except sometimes I   ll have a little extra and I   ll  decide,    Yeah, I think I   d like to make some pickles.    You know, maybe  some cucumbers, make some pickles.  I used to make a lot of jelly around Christmas time. I used to have a  cactus. There used to be a lot of cactus right out here and the fruit off of  it   that big old purple fruit. I   d take it and knock the stickers off and  peel it and cook it and then take the juice and make the jelly. It   s very  good. And I also make marmalade out of the fruit sometimes. And then I  would have elderberries. I would pick them and boil them and make  elderberry jelly and then sometimes, I used to have pear trees down here,  but they haven   t given me anything for the last several years. When  people bring me pears, I   ll make some pear honey. So I always had a lot  of that to give away to my family for Christmas. Like I said, I pretty  much got out of the mode of doing it here in the last few years.  And do you have to have the recipe to do this or do you just know, since  you   ve done it so often?  When you   ve done it so often, you just know. I taught my sis, that  passed away just last year, about canning and she never did do any of it.  She was one of the younger ones. Where she lived, she had apple trees  and apples. Oh, they were beautiful apples and so I showed her how to  fix them and can apples and make apple butter and applesauce and we  did two years doing that. I think it was the year before last, my  husband   I was just needing to be with him. He was on dialysis and he  had sugar diabetes and he had both of his feet gone and so it was a task  for me to take care of him, but it was a pleasure. And so I told her, I  said,    Sis, I   m not going to do it this year.    And so she had to do it. She  knew how. The marmalade that I make with the cactus    A girl that  stopped by one day wanted to know if she could sometime get some of  19  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  the cactus. She said,    My mother used to make cactus marmalade when  we were in California.    That was at the same time that the mall was still  over here at Stroud, before the tornado took it down and so I said,    Well,  sure.    So she came by and got some and she made some marmalade and  brought the jar by and brought the recipe. And that was so good because  it had oranges and lemons and you cook it down. I made several batches  of that and it   s so good. Put it on your biscuits or on your butter and  bread. (Laughs)  Your mother canned a lot? Did they have a cellar?  Yeah. The walls were lined with shelves, sturdy shelves, and we   d have  our canned goods all placed on those shelves.  Underground?  Yes, the cellar was underground.  And how would they keep things cool?  Well, when you go in the cellar, it   s cool underground. But when we had  the ice box, we   d a lot of times set something in the ice box to cool it  down. When we cooled our milk, we took big buckets of well water and  set it down in it to cool the milk, what we would use for drinking. I don   t  remember the year we got a refrigerator. I   m almost sure that it was  sometime when I was in high school. It was either in the latter    40s or  the early    50s.  Chandler had an ice plant, I   m assuming?  Yes, they did, on the south end of town there. It had a big old dock on it.  I could have told you the man   s name that ran it, but they delivered ice  once a week. Sometimes we would put the little card out on our door  knob of how many pounds that we needed and he would just deliver it.  And then we   d put it in our ice box and that kept it from melting so fast  and it was pretty heavy. The ice box was pretty heavy and it had a big  door on it and had one of these handles that you   d pull out like this and  it opens and closes it. I don   t know whatever happened to it.  Well, did you ever raise cotton?  Oh yes. Actually, I picked a little cotton, but I don   t remember my dad  raising cotton. Now, his Dad did because this is my dad and his father  picking cotton. But when we kids were in grade school, our school  would close down in the fall   cotton season time   and some of the  families that had big families needed to have something to help them by  20  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  in the winter, they would go to western Oklahoma and pick cotton and  then when they got back, we   d start back up. It took a lot of kids out of  school because when you   ve got a family that has eight or ten kids and  you take several out    But we never did go pick cotton.  So their primary income from the farm was dairy, your grandparents?  Well I   m sure they probably did like we did, they separated their milk  and cream. See, you could sell your cream. There was a place in town,  Seabirds and Clifford Hicks bought your cream and your eggs, so they  would sell eggs and cream and would buy their staples or their feed and  their groceries, what they needed. And I   m sure my grandparents were  like my mother and father, they made their bread and canned their  vegetables. I can remember Grandma being a small lady and, of course,  she was always small. I mean trim, she was tall but she was never large  or anything. She sewed for us children when we were young and I   m  sure they helped Mom and Daddy quite a little bit with the kids.  My oldest sister, when she started school, sometimes the bigger boys  were bullies to the little girls and little kids sometimes. They   d get their  hats and throw them across the road or in the ditch or something and  Grandma didn   t like that. So she had her come to town and I think she  went her first four years or five years in town. When she came back, like  I said, I don   t remember at home, but I was only like five-and-a-half  when she graduated out of the eighth grade because she   s eight years  older than I. She stayed in town with my grandma when she went to high  school and then she worked during her high school years. She thinks it   s  kind of strange that I don   t remember and I said,    Well Sis, you   ll have  to remember that you   re eight years older than I am. And even though  you were at home, I was too young to remember you being home.    I  wish I could remember earlier than five, but I don   t.  Did they quilt much?  I remember my grandmother, my aunt Wanda   that   s my daddy   s sister.  She never did marry. She always lived with her folks and, of course, she  was there to take care of her folks and she took care of my mother,  looked in after her while my dad still had cattle on the farm. And I  remember seeing stacks and stack of quilts that she had made. They  were quilted and she made a lot of   like when blankets kind of wore  out, well they would go inside of a comfort, in other words. She would  have this top that she would put on top of them and they would be  padding or filling for them and some were tacked. She would tack those  and those would be a big heavy quilt or comfort for our beds at home.  And then she did quilt a lot of quilts and I think her sister got a lot of  those quilts. The one that lived in Oklahoma City, Dad   s younger  21  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  sister   I was talking about, not Grandma   s sister, but Dad   s younger  sister.  Where would they have gotten their fabric during those days?  Well there were stores in town that had fabric. There was C. R.  Anthony   s in town. There were fabric stores in town. Of course, years  later Wal-Mart came to town. I was trying to think of some of the earlier  ones. Oh, Hellman   s. He was a Jewish man, they had Hellman   s  Clothing and Fabric Store. When I was young I was always buying  material because I sewed a lot. I sewed for my family. I   d sew for the  twins. I don   t have any of their pictures out here, but I   ve got them. They  were my babies. I never did have a baby doll. I never did have a doll  when I was a little and when they came long, it was so much fun. I had  real live babies. They could cry, they could eat and we had an old rocker  and I   d sit in that rocker, one in one arm and one in the other. But when I  had to feed them, I held one and bottle fed them. And it was so much  fun  (Laughs) I said I probably had more fun than anyone that had little  dolls. And I   ve always told them,    You all are my babies.    I said,    I  could feed you and I could diaper you when you had wet panties and  rock you to sleep and pat you.    They think it   s kind of cool, you know. I  was about thirteen when they were born.  I   m guessing they used some feed sacks in the early days too     Oh yeah, that   s all we knew. When the kids were young, that   s what  Grandma did. She made us dresses out of feed sacks. And of course,  when we had the chickens   we always had chickens, but a lot of the  times we had a lot of chickens, then you got your flour in cloth sacks too  because Daddy bought the fifty-pound bags of flour and most usually  they were white. Your bedding was made out of those. Your sheets were  made out of your white sacks that your flour came in and then the  colored ones, Grandma would make us dresses out of those.  Did you get to pick? Did you get to go to the store and pick?  Normally when we got a pattern. Sometimes we did. We didn   t get to go  to town very often. Maybe once a month I got to go to town when I was  little. And of course, you didn   t just run to town all the time. I mean, you  had to make plans when you went to town. One thing I do remember  too, there was Len Horse Ice Cream Store down Main Street and you  could buy a cone of ice cream for a nickel. That was a real treat when we  got to go to town with Dad and we could get an ice cream cone.  The flavor was probably chocolate or vanilla?  22  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Yes, probably was. (Laughs)  Town wasn   t really that far, mileage-wise?  It was about eleven or twelve miles from where we lived. You go out  here to 177 and you go down south on 177   I can   t remember how  many miles   and then back east a mile and then back up north of the  pasture.  And they would go there on horse in the early days?  Well they had a Model A or I know they had a buggy and a horse and  that   s kind of how we went around to the neighbors. I had a  grandmother, my mother   s mother, who lived off on south about a mile  and then back east about a mile or two miles. I remember going down  there in a team and wagon. We kids would be in the wagon and we   d  drag our feet, and we   d go down the country road. But I don   t remember  any other time except the Model A or the pick-up. But now that was like  in    49; I was fourteen years old. But I   m not sure if I got to go to town  much before then or not.  Since you had lots of chickens growing up on the farm, if you had  chicken for supper, who would go out and butcher the chicken?  My mother would.  So walk us through that process.  Well, I know how I did it after I got older, but I   m almost sure Mother  did it the same way. Now some ring their necks, but I   ve seen Mother  take the axe and lay the head on the stick of wood and take that axe  down and chop the head off, right below the head. Then we always had  our water hot and then we would douse them in the hot water until the  feathers came out easily and made sure you had the wings in there long  enough where the hard wing feathers would come out. Then you would  singe them,  to get  that little hair that   s on them  off . You would take,  usually a brown paper bag does a good job because it doesn   t get them  black or anything, a brown paper bag and singe the hair off of them and  then take them into the house and then water and clean them. Of course  you had to use dish pans, there were no sinks then (laughs), until later.  And a lot of times we did it outdoors. We would use tubs that we rinsed  our clothes in, put water in it and that way you   d have a bigger area.  Usually we had to do two or three for our family. And then we would  clean them up and then we   d start guttin    them and cuttin    them up.  And for the hogs?  23  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  For the hogs? Well we always had what they called a big old five-gallon  slop bucket in the house and all of our scraps went in it and that was a  part of the hog feed. A lot of times if it had quite a bit of liquid in it, why  we would carry it out and put some shorts in it. Dad bought shorts. It  was made from wheat, you know. And then any other grain, corn or  whatever, and poured it in their troughs and slopped it up good. I   ve  seen Mother many a day   s carry those five-gallon buckets and, of  course, it came around where some of us kids would carry them, too.  And how many pigs would you have?  Oh, I   ve known the times when I   m sure we had at least six or eight.  And he would butcher one each fall?  Usually two each fall. We   d have a day that Dad would set apart where  the boys or somebody would be there that could help get them killed.  They had a   I don   t know what this tool is hanging in a tree that you  hook their legs to and you can just pull them on up and pull them up  high enough where they can work with them and get their skin off and  then if it   d be cold enough then there weren   t any flies or anything and  they would cool in the tree. They would take them down and he   d have a  big area where he   d lay them on and cut them up. He would always salt  the hams with whatever this curing mixture was and put on them and  then they would lay in the smokehouse to cure, as well as the bacon.  And then Mother would work up the sausage and then pork chops, we  pretty well ate those up pretty fast. (Laughs) If we could keep them  where we could have them along, why he wouldn   t cure those. We   d  have them fresh.  Did the smokehouse actually have smoke?  No. We always called it a smokehouse, I don   t know why. It was just a  big tall building and then it had area tables laying out there prepared to  put the meat on.  And did she have a sausage recipe or was it just ground?  Well, they ground the meat, but I   m sure they had the seasoning   how  to put so much seasoning in it, you know. It was never real spicy, but it  was really good and then we   d make it into patties and put it in these big  iron skillets. She had several big iron skillets and she   d put them on the  woodstove and cook it slow, until it browns and turn it over and, of  course, the lard would cook out of it, too. You didn   t have just a whole  bunch of lard in it, but Mother always rendered her lard. The big portion  of the lard, she rendered it. And that   s what we cooked with, made pie  24  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  crust with that. And then any kind of lard, or anything that she would be  cooking and it had grease from it, if she didn   t use it for cooking, why  she would save it in containers and that   s how she used all of that when  she would make her soap. She did it in the big kettle and I don   t know  what she put in it, but I know she used lye. Even Grandma saved the  drippings for her after she moved to town. She   d save the drippings from  the meat and stuff and then she   d get those and we   d have a big batch of  soap sometimes and we   d put a bar of that in our washing machine after  Mama got a ringer, I mean one of those Maytag washers that had a  ringer on it and the two rinse tubs. It   s surprising how it soaps up and  how it makes the water so soft and cleans your clothes. In fact, I bought  a bar of lye soap here the other day at the feed store.  Just for old times    sake?  Yes, well the smell   it   s good for you, really. Of course, I used to buy  the bar soaps, but anymore I just buy the little squirt bottles. They do say  that some of that that has the antiseptic in it, it may not be as good for  you as you think.  Were there traveling salesmen coming where they would get their spices  or would they get them in town?  There was the Watkins Man; it seems like there was another one. Yes, I  remember the good strong vanilla, you could get that from them and  other spices and I can   t think of the other one. I know there was another.  We   ve had someone say a Triple K.  I don   t remember that.  Going back to food, how would your family go about making homemade  ice cream? What was the process?  We would use our fresh eggs, put them in a bowl, beat them up. Of  course, a lot of times we had this kind of beater like this and then we   d  put our sugar in, according to what kind of ice cream you were making.  If you were making vanilla, you   d put the vanilla in and, of course, we  used some cream. Not all cream, but some cream to make it good and  rich. Daddy did buy what was called ice cream mix or either the junkets.  We had either one. He preferred the ice cream mix and sometimes we   d  put the ice cream mix in there. He had a two gallon ice cream freezer. It  was a White Mountain, but it was an old crank kind. So after we put so  much cream in it then we would fill it up with milk and then we would  put it in our freezer and we had the blocks of ice and we would put them  in a gunny sack or some kind of a bag to break up with the axe or  25  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Nykolaiszyn  Kalka  whatever. You know, we usually turned our axe over on the side and just  beat it. Or if we did have a sledge hammer, sometimes we used a sledge  hammer and crushed the ice and put it in there and put our salt around it  and kept on cranking.  And everybody would take turns cranking?  Everybody usually would take turns cranking and then one kid would  usually sit on the ice cream freezer to keep it still, try to keep it still. And  when we thought maybe it was getting through, well then Daddy would  test it and then it was through. If it was tested just right then it was  through. And sometimes we let it set for awhile because if you let it set,  especially when it   s iced down with that salt around it, it makes it firmer.  I haven   t had any in a long time.  In fact, I was thinking about making some maybe Easter. (Laughs)  Well I   ll have to come back.  We   ll be here. (Laughs)  I was telling one of my grandkids, I said,    I think your grandma   s going  to fix Easter dinner.    And he said,    Well what are you having?    I said,     Maybe a turkey.    I have a turkey that I really need to cook. It has been  in the deep freeze for too long. And some ham.  Do you cure your own ham still?  No.  I noticed some cows around so I wondered     Butcher calves.  Do you have any recollections of hobos or tramps coming through? And  your mom maybe feeding them or putting them to work?  Not out on the farm. Although, my dad did do a lot of helping out the  neighbors; sometimes they would be in a dire stretch of need and he  would maybe get some food items for them, for their families and things  like that. Now when my grandma moved to town, I remember her  talking about hobos coming to their doors. After we moved out here on  the highway, I   ve had a few that just stopped in, but I   m not too sure  they were hobos.  26  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Do you remember your dad getting his first tractor? Or did he have  one?  You know, he didn   t get a tractor until I was on my own. After he  moved to town, he had a pretty good little spot there by the house. I  don   t know, it wasn   t a brand new tractor. It was just a used tractor that  he got from someone and he just loved it. He did a pretty good garden  spot and he made a big garden down there and gave most of it away.  Sometimes he   d sell a little bit, but he just enjoyed giving it away. And  that   s the way I am. I just enjoy giving it away. I like to grow it and I  just either give it away or take it to church and let people take whatever  they want and they can use, why they can have it.  Neighbors helping neighbors.  Yeah, it   s more blessed to give than to receive.  Did you participate in any threshing rings or that type of thing?  We never did have a threshing crew. We did work around a sorghum  mill. He didn   t have the mill, but my grandpa Gilliam on my mama   s  side, their neighbor had one and they grew cane. We helped our grandpa.  They grew cane and the man that had the mill grew cane. To help him  out and him to make our sorghum, Daddy and us kids would go down  and cut the heads off of the cane and stack them in the wagon and then  strip the cane of their leaves and then cut the cane stalks down and stack  them together. They would bring them into the sorghum machine where  you took one stick at a time and run it through that press. A horse run  that press going around and around and where we stuck that cane, it was  making it go around and around and pull that cane stalk through. It had a  trough attached to it. That juice would fall in that trough and it would go  down to the trough that had the fire under it and here was the first  portion of it. It would cook awhile and when the last trough got ready to  run out, it was fully cooked, why the rest of the juice would come down  and it would have sections in the troughs. It would cook and bubble up  and have that foam on top and us kids would go by and catch that foam  with our finger and put it in our mouth. It was really, really good. And I  love sorghum to this day. I happened to find someone that lives in  Arkansas that has family here and they send some up and down at the  feed store. They sell it down there, so I   ve gotten several jars of that  down there.  Do you prefer that over honey?  Oh, I love honey. I love sorghum and I love honey. And there is people  that have bees around here that I buy honey from. I   m a firm believer in  27  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  natural. And I think it   s been a great help to me even because I am not  on any kind of medication. No kind of prescription drugs and I haven   t  had a sick day in my life hardly. (Laughs) I   ve had a few problems after  I retired from work, but I got those taken care of.  It   s life on the farm and all of the fresh air.  All of the fresh air, all of the good food.  And the guineas or whatever.  Well I do have one guinea out there. I have chickens and the good ole  yolk is just as yellow as can be   orange, really.  So the farm went from initially eighty acres or 160 initially?  Initially, not in our name. Initially in my grandfather   s son   s name it was  160 acres. And my grandmother went to her brother-in-law and bought  the eighty acres from him, so that gave him an eighty and my  grandmother an eighty. And actually it was my   see this is his brother.  The boy that staked the claim or got the claim in his name and this is my  grandpa, it was his older that had it. My grandmother always said that  Charlie was not old enough to stake the claim and in reading this book,  Oklahoma Run, it said that they had to be twenty-one. And if that   d been  the case, he was like twenty.  He was close then, but not close enough.  But I didn   t know. I didn   t know what age it was and asked several  people and they didn   t know either. They thought,    Oh, eighteen.    That  they thought they were in manhood. Said they had no way of telling or  something and I said,    Well surely they had an age on it because I   ve  always heard Grandma saying that Grandpa was not old enough.     And it got up to as large as 480?  Yeah, Dad bought  320  acres and he got in the cattle business in a  pretty big way. Then the price of cattle dropped and various things and  they just couldn   t make a go to do what needed to do I guess, so he sold  those  320  acres. And then a few years later, then the boys were grown  and getting families and married and so he sold them forty acres a piece  and they both built houses out there.  So currently today is there any of the original left still in the family?  There   s about twenty-two acres originally that is still in the family. The  28  two brothers that built their homes out there, one brother divorced and  his wife got the house and property and so she has sold it. The other  brother and his wife, they came into a very hard time. They built and  financed it and their payments   I think the bank was carrying it so it  was horrendous and he was in cement work. Well that slowed down an  awful lot and he couldn   t make his payments. So I told him,    Brother,  surely the bank would help you to lower your payments.    But somehow  or another they didn   t work with him and so they had to sell. So they  don   t have their property out there anymore.  The other portion of this eighty acres was split between the other seven  children since these two boys had  forty  acres  each  over here. So each  one of us had a little over eleven acres, so that was that eighty acres.  Well my sister that died in    07   it was back in    06 she called several of  the brothers and sisters and asked them if they would like to sell. She  wanted to get out from some indebtedness because she lost her husband  in early years and she was left with indebtedness and she was getting up  in years. And so I said,    Well, I probably would never do anything with  it.    And I   ve tried to give it to both of the boys that lost theirs. But  neither wanted it because they didn   t figure they would go back there  and live. And I told them,    I   ll just give it to you.    And no. Anyway,  five of us kids on the west side   all these acres   they said yeah, they   d  go ahead and sell. Because I lost my brother in    06, the oldest brother,  and so his wife and of course all of his kids was away from home. So  she said yeah, she would sell, too. So that put five kids    pieces of  property all together. So that was fifty-seven-plus acres. And then the  other two pieces was over here on the east side where the old house set  and then the other sisters,  Phyllis and Marilyn, still have their property .  These people that bought it, they lived in Oklahoma City and they come  out and looked at it. They fell in love with it. They said,    This is  exactly       it was just trees and brush had grown up and that   s what they  liked, so they bought it and that was in    06. We were so surprised. We  got  1700 an acre for it. I mean, we were so surprised. I wouldn   t have  give that for it, but anyway, the lady that sold it, she said,    Yeah, it   s  selling for that. You can get that for it.    I said,    Good.    It was a big help  to my sister and she was the one that kind of instigated it and got the  realtor and everything. It took about a year to do it, but we got it sold  and, of course, with that many children and there was a lot of having to  get this all worked out and so the realtor said,    I don   t know whether I   ll  ever take on a big project like this with this many people again      (Laughs) But anyway she did. She got it done and we got our money and  I haven   t seen the people since they moved out there.  One day I went out to the farm and took these pictures, see they   re just  right here. I could have walked up to the fence, but they had two big old  29  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  dogs. They were big dogs and they were barking and I was just talking  to myself over there and I guess they heard me and they started barking.  I was going to get a little closer to see if they had done anything, which  they bought the sister   s trailer that moved a trailer out there. Hers was  the last piece of property here with these other two pieces over here. So  the trailer was sitting over here and I thought, well I   m going to peak  over there. I wouldn   t go any closer than where I was when I heard the  dogs. They were coming up to the fence, but they had this big old tall  fence that was like a hog wire fence, but it was tall because the dogs  couldn   t get over it. And I didn   t want to rile them up, you know, going  over there.  They probably still work in the City. I don   t know if they live out there,  if they built a house out there. I have no idea. But I   d like to know  (laughs) because see the road just winds back up in through there and  you   ve got to get to the farmhouse to pretty much see if they   ve done  anything. Daddy had built a new pond the latter part of his years. He had  another pond back west, but he had built a nice big new pond and that  was the piece of property that we sold. I would have loved to walk down  through there and just remember my childhood, you know, as I would go  get the cows and bring them up. You   d just herd them together and  they   d all walk up this cow trail and you   d be behind them walking them  up. It   s just memories is what it is.  So the twenty-two acres is still in your hands then?  It   s in my siblings   .  In the family?  Yeah, it   s in the family. I know whenever I turned in to get my  Centennial Farm, they sent me a letter saying,    We think you just got  things confused.    I mean maybe that   s my way of putting it. Maybe it  wasn   t so harsh. (Laughs) That you   re not a Centennial Farm. Well I  went back and I get all these papers again and I said,    My dad had ten  children and each child has a piece of land. And yes, it is a Centennial  Farm.    I told how my dad worked on his farm to raise ten children. And  they wrote me a letter of apology. (Laughs) Because my sister, she   s the  one that was keeping her property and she wanted one because I had  already went through Centennial Farm with this and I said,    Well I know  I couldn   t get it out there, but since we   re gonna sell then I probably  won   t need it.    And she said,    Oh would you get it for me?    and I said,     Well yeah, I will.    And so that   s why I sent it all in. But I didn   t tell  them that we were selling. We hadn   t sold it yet and so she got it and she  was so happy because it is a nice plaque that talks about being a  Centennial Farm.  30  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Is it at the farm or does she have it?  No, she still has it and she   s the one that died last year. Of course, she  had the piece of property put in her son   s name before she passed away.  A few years before she passed away, because she had some illness  earlier on in life and she thought she didn   t want it being taken away  from her for fear that the doctor bills and some things that she may not  be able to take care of.  Then it   s still in the family too then if she gave it in her will to her sons.  Yes. Both of these girls, because the other girl, she   s in a wheel chair  and she can stand up some, but she was in an accident when she was  working at Wichita. I don   t know just what all happened, but anyway it  just ruined part of her left side and she kept telling them and I think later  on she had some strokes. But she is in pretty good shape. I   ve had her  come down different times and she spends maybe months with me at a  time and I enjoy her. Early in her life when she was going through all  this, she did have hers put in her son   s name, so at least they both have  property, but it   s in the family. But we don   t know what   s going to  happen to it.  I didn   t expect my sister Phyllis to pass away when she did. She was  only sixty-four. And she said    Louberta, I can   t wait till I get sixty-five.     She   d be sixty-five in November because she was going to have a  complete physical. She had health issues about a year or so before that,  they didn   t know what in the world was going on. Well she went to the  hospital at Cushing. They kept her a week or ten days and she was  totally out. She didn   t know anybody. She was out. But it had to be her  gallbladder when she was up there and when they released her and she  had tubes carrying this old green bile stuff out of her body, running out.  And they wanted her to come back and she said,    I   m not going back up  there.    So she went to Mercy up at Oklahoma City and they had her for  a long time and they finally found that her gallbladder was collapsed and  she had tubes then running out of her.  I mean she took a long time to get back to where she felt like she was  human. She was probably home for about a year and she was waiting to  get on Medicare so she could have a complete physical because she kept  saying something   s wrong. I knew something was wrong because she  could hardly breathe. She (breathes deeply) and she didn   t smoke. She  was here the Thursday before she passed away on that following  Monday.  She was taking care of her grandkids. Her son got into some problems  and he was serving some time and she was keeping them in school and  31  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  Kalka  Finchum  she lived up here at Parkland. She usually would get up and get them off  to school and I know she probably just didn   t feel very good and went  and laid back down. It was hot. It was last of July. The kids came in;  they had some activity after school so they didn   t make it in till about  five. And so when they came in, they found their grandma in bed in bad  shape. That was sad. A lot of sad things sometimes come to our families,  but we have to keep a going. We have to keep a going, we sure do.  Do you have anything else you want to add before we sign off?  Well I think I   ve rambled. (Laughter) It   s a different life, but I love it.  When I lost my husband some of my girlfriends said,    Why don   t you  just sell that and move to town?    I said,    You   ve got to be kidding      (Laughs) I said,    No way. I love the farm. I grew up on the farm. It   s  part of my life. It   s peaceful. It   s quiet.    And I said,    You will not get  me off the farm. You will take me off the farm whenever I   m gone.     Well hopefully that won   t be for a much, much longer time.  Well the way I want to go is like my sis, I hope I   m out here working. I  hope I have my druthers, but I hope whenever my time is gone I   ll just  be (slams the table) like that. Because I   ve always said that,    Well when  the Lord   s through with me then I hope I just drop. I hope they find me  where I   m working.    (Laughs)  Well thank you for your time, it   s been great.  -------  -------
