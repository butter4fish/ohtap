 Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, also with me is Tanya Finchum. Today  is Friday, February 17, 2012. We   re in Lawton, Oklahoma interviewing  June and Allan Barrington. We   re here on the Lowry Family Farm, and  this project is part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral  History Project, part of the Oklahoma State University Library  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Thank you for joining us  today, we appreciate it. Well, we   re going to start with you, June, and  I   m going to ask you how your family came to Oklahoma and came to  settle right here.  Well, I didn   t tell you this before, but whenever my great-grandfather  and grandmother on my grandfather   s side   on my mother   s side   I  mean, they lived in Illinois. They had a farm in Illinois and my great-grandfather  kept hearing about how wonderful it was in Oklahoma. So,  one day, he just up and sells the family farm in Illinois and goes in and  says,    We   re going to Oklahoma,    and they sell their things, and put  their belongings on the train and come to Lawton, Oklahoma. This is  supposed to be the land of lush farms and everything, milk, and honey.  (Laughs)  They get here and of course, the lottery has already been. A man named  Beauregard had drawn this farm. But they had, of course, sold the farm  in Illinois so they were looking for something comparable to what they  had there. But as far as this, they chose this place because of the low  land. In those days, you wanted low land because it grew wheat and  things better. So, they chose this farm and bought it from Mr.  Beauregard. Now, that was my great-grandfather that did that. And of  course, my grandfather came with them, but he wasn   t married at the  time. So, then they came and he went back and married my grandmother  and brought her out here. They settled here and that was the way they  came to Oklahoma. That was pretty brief, but there   s much more of a  story about it. (Laughs)  5  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  There is more to it.  Yes, but that   s pretty much it.  Now, the Beauregard land, was there anything, any structures, any  homes?  Not that I know of. I don   t know of anything that was here. There is four  rooms there and an upstairs. That was the original, and then I just  discovered, myself, that these two rooms were added on later onto the  original, but I didn   t know that. That was also added on. But that was  before I knew anything about these. My Aunt Mary Sue kept telling me  that this was added on and I kept telling her,    No, it   s not,    because I  thought she was confused. But I went upstairs and I could see then  where the original siding was on the original house up there, in this  room that   s over there. It was those four rooms and the upstairs  that   were the original parts. But I do not know who built them. I   m assuming  my great-grandfather and grandmother did.  And when they came to Oklahoma and they started to settle on the land,  early crops, what were they growing?  Well, I guess wheat.  I ran through the books. They had wheat. They had corn. They had a lot  of oats for cattle.  And they did milk.  They milked. That   s how we got our foothold on this place. I remember  the dairy. I was very young when they sold it, but the dairy was what  kept them rolling.  Then there   s the dairy barn down here, and that   s not the original one.  The original was sitting out north. It had a lot of alfalfa for those dairy  cattle. They seem to have fed a lot of oats and alfalfa to those dairy  cattle. It wasn   t Holsteins. It was Shorthorns, dual purpose cattle, where  they could raise beef and milk the cows. Shorthorns are what put this  place on the map. I   m a cattleman. That   s where my base of study is.  The Shorthorns are what put this place on the map, like I said.  He has Angus. He   s got good ones. His boys did a lot of showing around  the state and have done taken lots of titles.  We   ve put a lot of cattle and feed out up there and have done very well.  6  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Finchum  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Well, in the early days, can you talk   outside of the house, the  farmhouse, some of the other early structures that you can recall?  Well, the chicken house, it   s always been there as far as I can remember,  way back when my grandmother had it. That   s still here. Now, they tore  down the brooder house. I don   t know. Wesley did that. I don   t know  how come. You probably helped him.  I know exactly why we tore it down. The tractor seemed to go through  it. (Laughter)  But then there is still what they called the smokehouse. I don   t  remember it as anything but just the place where they put wheat and  things. But that   s that little house out there. It   s still there. Like he said,  this house down here has been there as long, but it   s been remodeled and  done some different things to. It   s always been there. Like he said, the  old barn was moved to the back but it doesn   t resemble much the way it  was whenever they milked in it to start. It was moved back behind the  horse barn. The horse barn has been there, and that   s the red barn back  there. This Smith place, the Smith barn as we call it, has been there as  far back as     The calving shed is on the west. We used to calve, put the cows in there  to calve.  Those have been there since year one, I guess. Now, this barn out here  was built in about 1940, maybe.  Big red barn. It   s still got the old hay grapple in the top of it that they  used to unload hay stacks. I would not let anybody tear that down. I  threw a fit on that. It is still there and the old tractor it runs on.  They used to put the haystack out there to the south of it.  And why is the one called the Smith house?  There used to be a shed up a mile and a half west of here that my great-grandfather  purchased. The barn was in good shape, and he didn   t like it  up there so they tore it all down and rebuilt it right back here.  Moved it back here, called it the Smith barn.  Smith shed is what they called it. It had granaries in it and everything,  and they rebuilt those pretty much like it was original. Of course, it was  tinned later on, but I remember that shed.  7  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Yes, in those days, when they moved that they didn   t have things like  these metal granaries and things like that, so they just did it themselves.  They built the shed. They built the granaries and everything.  This one down here has the loft and everything.  Yes, it still does.  I used to climb up in there.  In the winter when I was growing up over here, that   s where they kept  the cows that were fixing to come fresh and have a calf. They put them  down in that red barn due to the fact that it was insulated up top and the  heat from the cows coming up would reflect that heat back down on the  cattle and the calves wouldn   t die.  My Grandpa had his cow/calf operation over there in that where he  would   the dairy, they would milk, you know, after a while, but when  the calves came in he would feed the calves and the cows over there on  the other side. They even had, when I was a little girl, way before his  time, they had a team of horses that they always hooked to the   did you  ever see the horses?  I   ll take the fifth on that.  I didn   t know whether you ever knew that.  I didn   t like to get around horses.  Oh, Grandpa had a good set of horses. He   d hook them to the hay wagon  and he used that for a long time just to haul wheat and hay around in.  We   ve been around here for quite a while.  Back in the early day of the milking operation, how many cows are we  talking about?  I   m sure that they would     I   ve got that on a DVD, I   m not sure.  You have a DVD on that?  Yes, I think I do. I think it was   it wasn   t very many. I think around  fifty or sixty. If I remember right, the number was sixty-four.  8  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  I   m sure that they would milk, and he had a hand then that would milk, a  dairy hand.  They brought in outside help?  Yes.  Just outside of the family?  Yes, of course, in the beginning it was family doing the stripping. I don   t  remember that part, but they did. I only remember the milkers. They  were so progressive. The way I remember it was that they had a Delco,  we called it a Delco. Of course, it was just a generator. But they had a  stack of batteries that was all over it. It   s in this house and it   s just about  to fall down, now. They used that and put it in that old barn, and they  had electric milkers. Then, of course, they progressed on onto the  electrification, the rural electrification at the time. But yes, they had their  own. Do you remember those batteries?  I can remember grandpa talking about that set of horses, too. I remember  when I was a little bitty kid, I guess three or four, he   d bring those  horses up on Sundays. His old forge is still down here. We   ve still got  his old forge. It   s in there. He would shoe those horses himself. He  was   I don   t know how old he was then. He lived a long time.  He was ninety-four when he passed away.  And up until the day he died, he had his cows.  He   s got cattle right down here, right now. I have one.  The Shorthorns have not left, and I made a vow that that will never  happen.  I have kept the Shorthorns, and he   s helped me keep them. But we keep  just a remnant herd on those.  Did your family always continue with the dairy operation? At one point  did they get out of it?  I don   t remember when it happened.  They got out of it. As far back as when they came here, yes, it was cattle  and farm up until 1962, I think it was. Yes,    62   or    61, we sold out in     61. My grandpa sold out in    61, sold the dairy cattle.  9  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  What was the reasoning behind that?  They were just at that point in time     Getting older   ?  They were older, and then Wesley and Mary Sue came to live here and  moved in with them. Wesley wasn   t really interested in keeping the  dairy going, as best I know about it. My father had the Shorthorns. But  he was teaching, too, and he didn   t have facilities, and he really wasn   t  able to do that either. So, just kind of lost interest in the dairy because,  listen, it   s a demanding thing. That   s twenty-four/seven, if you want to  say it that way.  Then at that point, did the family decide to venture into other types of  livestock or cattle with less maintenance?  Well, my dad kept the Shorthorns. My dad had the Shorthorns, but it  wasn   t on this farm. We kept the Shorthorns. We   ve got them, like he  said. How many cattle are over there right now? About twenty head of  momma cows over there.  Thirty.  Thirty cows, of Shorthorns, over on one of the farms west of here. Then  I have some up at the house. I have five more heifers up at the house that  are Shorthorn. Of course, they   re bred right now to Angus.  Well, partially. Wolfy is part bull Angus.  He   s half Angus.  He   s half and half. They   re here. But then, to get back to your   question , they ventured out into the beef Angus, so.  Okay. How, over time, have the crops changed?  Because everybody in this operation has had a job outside of this  operation itself, most of them were schoolteachers. I worked for  Goodyear Tire and Rubber for twenty-seven years. Everybody had  outside income, and what the easiest thing was to do is wheat and cattle.  They run simultaneously, it   s not as time consuming. Of course, we have  our hay crops, but we   re not as tied up in the production side of  agriculture. We   re more in the beef side of agriculture. That is because  we were all outside working, bringing in extra income. That was the best  10  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  way to do it.  That   s what has changed, from having to make everything off the land.  Well, what   s funny about this, I laugh at this because we   re the most  highly educated agricultural people you   ll ever meet. Every one of us in  the family has a degree. It helps us as far as the research and stuff on  what problems are, where we can turn a corner to make it profitable.  Mom   s got a master   s in microbiology. If I have a problem there, I  always turn to her and I   m basically animal science, doing all that. My  son is an agronomist. So, we all try to coincide and work together.  (Laughs) That   s what makes this work.  Yes, Cody has his degree from Cameron, that   s his son. Now, Justin is  the one that lives out here. My other son is a pharmacist, but he doesn   t  do any farm work. He says he   d like to, but he   s in Tulsa, so that   s a far  piece. (Laughs)  If he comes here we   ll let him do it.  So, June, when you were a little girl, did you spend much time on this  property?  Yes. Yes.  And would you have chores?  I was busy trying to just keep out of everybody   s way because I   m an  only child and an only grandchild. Whenever anybody happened to be  going, like if they were going to the field and take somebody back to the  field, I hitched a ride, went with them at six or five years old, whatever.  Yes, my chores were like going to the garden, in those days. I thought  my grandmother was going to plant the world in peas. We had to pick  peas, and we dug potatoes, and there was a peach orchard out here that  my grandfather had. Did you ever see any peach trees out there?  Just a few.  There were things in those days we canned and we     There   s still some old stuff down in the cellar that they canned back  years ago.  Yes, that was what we did. So, that was that kind of thing around the  house. But I was always tromping around with whoever happened to be  going to   I can remember walking out here always in the summertime. I  would just go barefoot. And it would be so hot, and I would have to run  11  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Finchum  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  across the chat, you know. But yes, I spent every summer here up until I  started school. I went to school at Chattanooga because my mother and  dad  worked there , my dad was superintendent at Chattanooga, and then  every weekend here. So, this is pretty much where I grew up.  So, do you remember any of the days before electricity?  No.  They always had electricity?  They always had electricity.  Okay.  And I don   t know that Mary Sue would. I think that she, like I told you,  they got the Delco. But I remember when they got their first refrigerator.  It was a propane or butane, and I can remember that there was a flame  underneath that kept burning constantly to keep making it cold. Because  before that, they had just a regular old ice box and it sat over here.  (Gestures) My grandmother would go to town and she   d pick up ice and  bring it home. Like you   d get one-hundred pounds of ice and put it in the  ice box. That   s the way it was.  And indoor plumbing?  As far as I remember, they   ve always had this bathroom, but there was  no toilet in it because in those days there were outdoor toilets most  everywhere.  The privy used to sit right out there between the brooder house and the  chicken house.  What is interesting that I tell the boys, of course, I was a Depression  child. You know how that goes. But I remember one time, just one time,  my grandmother decided that they needed to have a new toilet. So,  somewhere she went, and I don   t know where, and told him that we  needed it. So, they sent the WPA boys out and dug and filled this one up  and got a new one. I remember that. I don   t know why I was so  impressed with that, but I was.  One-seater or two?  It was one, the only one I saw out there.  Just the one.  12  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  I remember as a kid, being nosy, and on the north side of it, there was a  newspaper stuffed in every crack you could see. (Laughs)  I can remember that. I   d always see a body put the Sears and Roebuck  catalog out in it. But what I started to say about this bathroom, it had a  tub, the regular bathtub. Well, the old fashioned kind with the legs and a  lavatory. That was pretty modern for the day.  What was the water source? Was there a water source?  Windmill.  The windmill? Okay.  Everybody around came to get water, from around, because it was a  good source. They came and they would come with milk cans to get  their water across the road, and that   s how they got their water. It was  pumped here. There was always a sink there as best as I  remember . I  guess that   s when they added this, and that was before my day on that  because there was a sink.  And where were holidays?  Here.  Here? You   d come to the farm, here.     when school was out in Chattanooga. They had a house there that they  stayed at during the week. It was always back here for the holidays and  whatever else because my dad came and he worked here. They were  hands.  Well, Allan, as a young man, you spent some time up here on the farm?  Every summer.  Every summer?  Kept me out of trouble.  And what would you end up doing on your summers?  You name it. Fix the fence and drive tractors     He made a hand, too, just like I was saying. They worked on the farms.  13  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington     get the cattle up and when I come, it seemed like they   d save every  cow and calf they got until I got out of school. Basically, we   d pull all  the cattle in and I   d work with them and just separate them into which  ones we were going to sell or whatever. There was never a dull moment  here. If you ate at this table, you were expected to pay your part. That   s  the way I was brought up.  Do you have siblings?  I have one brother. He had allergies so bad, he came over here and he   d  try. But during harvest time, literally his face would swell and he  couldn   t breathe. He just couldn   t hold it. He tried. He still has a fond  memory for this place. He really does, because this is home.  You remember the first tractor you ever fired up?  Yes I do. Model R John Deere, and I hated that thing. Because I guess I  was eleven and it did not have power steering. I learned how to use my  feet, my hands, my body just to turn that thing. I was telling my mom  when we got the newer ones, the 40-20s, and learned to bale hay,  learned to rake hay, learned to plow real good. As time went on, during  harvest   that was the thing about it, harvest was a big time of year for  us. My job was to fill the granaries. It seemed like those trucks would  never stop. I remember I guess I was thirteen then, and I learned how to  back those trucks and unload them myself while the guys came in during  supper and    I remember I   d unload and they   d come in and eat, they   d  take the truck back. Then I   d come in and eat while they were loading,  then I   d go back out. At one time there was granaries all down that side,  and they put oats. Oats is what I hated, and that   s what got my brother  sick. And barley, the next two, and wheat from next year   s planting was  in the next two.  See, he came over and my uncle, Mary Sue   s husband, and my dad, he  would be their flunky pretty much. They   d keep him going. After all, it  would be his granddad, see.  Well, I will say this. I learned how to dodge big cows. It gave me some  athletic ability that I was able to capitalize on later in life. I had the  fortunate opportunity to play college football when I got a little bit older.  Those cows were nothing compared to those big guys.  Where   d you end up playing?  I played at Cameron.  14  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Okay.  They had football teams then. They don   t now, but.  That   s where I found out that you may be the biggest guy in high school,  but when you get to college it   s a different ballgame. Those guys were  out for blood.  But you know, now, Quinton was my husband, his dad, he had a pretty  good agriculture background, too, so it kept it in the family. He had a  degree in forestry from Auburn University. So, he was out there  showing, you know, keeping his boys in the agriculture field, too.  The thing about it, I remember Dad teaching me how to graft pecan  trees. Down here on this creek, there is a pecan tree that I guess was  there before you and Dad got married.  Oh, yes. That was there before year one.  There is one down there that is as big around as this room. It   s huge, and  that is kind of where we   I kind of set that as our monolith. Now, you  talk about my days here, when I was younger, about nine or ten, Wesley  bought me a horse. I remember I would give   he said,    You need to  learn where all these places are that we have.    He saddled the horse up. I  didn   t know what he was doing. This was before daylight. Wesley got  up before the chickens. Went down, saddled that horse, brought it up  here to the house, tied it off, and he said,    You need to find every nook  and cranny on this place.    I kind of looked at him, and he threw me  lunch, gave me a water bottle and said,    Don   t come home until dark.     Now, you did what they said or you were in trouble. But I rode and  found every place that this family owned at that time, found where the  cows would hide and actually found cows that they   d been looking for  that were dead. I came in that night, and he made me tell him what I   d  found. I was tired. I slept good that night. I found out about the Thornhill  place up there where all the little nooks and crannies were in there. I  found some coyotes, found some pups, things like that. I remember that  day very well because they wanted me to know every inch of this place.  That Thornhill place, he was talking about that. But now, that   s  connected to the airport, now. We   ve had some city expansions that  we   ve had to deal with.  This well was good up until 1984 when they put this dump in down here.  This used to be the sweetest water. You could be thirsty on the hottest  day of the year, go in that well house, kick that water on, and you   d  15  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  quench your thirst in about two drinks. That was it. Now, this stuff is  just as sour as it can be.  You know, Shawna, I told you, was a Geronimo girl and somebody  down there told her, she said she was here taking care of me, that she  should drink water from that well because it was the best water you   d  ever find anywhere. I had to tell her,    Don   t you do it,    because it has  been   because of the dump.  We were going to ask you about that, we noticed that. What year did it  go in?     68.  Was that a shock to you, or did you all know?  There was meetings. There was township meetings about that at the old  schoolhouse up here, because I remember going to them. They tried to  put an injunction in on it, and there was a big collection taken with that  deal. And as I remember, they tried, but the city of Lawton seemed like  they had the ace in the hole. Basically, ever since, they   ve run over us in  this area. There is no statute we had to work with or against them in any  way, anyhow.    We   ve got it, we   re going over you.    That   s what their  attitude is     What  I mean, we do need some good statutes against the  encroachment.  They did mess the well up.  Have you noticed neighbors leaving because of it? Environment  changing?  What we   ve noticed, and this is an honest true fact, it   s been  documented. Our neighbor across the road got cancer. His son had  cancer. We   ve got another neighbor up the road up here that has got  colon cancer. We   re not sure about Wesley, but we think that he became  very ill because of contamination.  The contamination of the water, really. We didn   t know how   it got  contaminated before you really knew it.  They connected us to city water just to shut us up, basically. (Laughs)  I   m two miles west of that by the side of that dump. As a matter of fact,  my uncle owned the land they are now starting the new dump on. They  just told him,    We   re going to take it whether you want to or not.     Eminent Domain.  16  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Eminent Domain. That is the worst law this country has ever passed  because they don   t give you fair market value for it.  I don   t know whether you   that   s what they told him, but     I was here when that went down. I happened to be off work that day  when they came to talked to him. Where we   re going now, we   re trying  to hold it all together. It gets harder and harder every day. The places I  have back over here on 82nd Street, if you look back north from that  place now, houses are coming farther south. You can look a mile and a  half west and north, there   s a whole subdivision up there. You can look  back straight north, they   re coming south just as fast as they can. I was  lucky enough to know my great-grandfather. He said a long time ago,    If  they get too close, sell it all, but make them pay.    (Laughter)  Well, anyway, we are holding it together over a hundred years now, in  this place. This has been the hub. What worries me right now is, of  course, he lives over to the west and has his place over there now. Of  course, I   m at this point and time, I   m not here. Mary Sue is here, but  this one grandson is here and hopefully he will. We will be keeping it,  but it   s not as well kept as it once was, right now.  I can remember great-grandpa, that walkway used to go all the way  down to the milk house. If there was rocks on it, he wanted them swept  off. That was my job. I forgot about that one.  Yes, but it was just not   well, you can see. They had a big operation  going with the buildings and all.  Where would they sell their milk?  Well, like I think I told you earlier, when my grandmother first   they  came here and they were milking their own cows and things like that,  they had their own customers. She did take them to town. I don   t  remember that, but I   m told that. I can remember going with her to  Fairmont Creamery to take the cans of milk after we got them. It was the  Fairmont Creamery here. Did you all know that? It is an old building.  It   s still there.  Then there was several dairies around. The Sullivans had a dairy and the  Hortons had a dairy. They sold it to what they call a Fairmont Creamery.  I think, you girls can look at that, but I think there was kind of a  corporation that was called Fairmont that maybe came out of the north.  It was, to me, though, at that time it was a big building. (Laughs) But it  17  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Finchum  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  might not be that big now. But it was a big operation at the time. Several  dairies brought their milk in there. In fact, who was it that I just ran into  that said they had worked at that? Oh, it was Mr. Nicks, this morning.  He said his dad worked at the Fairmont Creamery and how he had gone  in there. You remember.  Yes.  Yes, his dad worked there. Well, now, what made us talk about that? But  anyway     Were chickens used for income or was it just for personal?  No, chickens were used for income, yes. I mean, eggs, you sold eggs.  You took them to the hatchery and sold eggs. We had hatcheries then,  too. I don   t think there   s a hatchery within a hundred miles of here, is  there? You girls might know that from OSU.  I know a lot of the chicken production is        is to the Arkansas, that area.  Yes. We   ve been to one farm up in that area. It was just right close to the  border. They preferred the Arkansas home, the cooperative extension  agents over the Oklahoma extension agents because that   s what they  specialized in.  They got to be egg factories in some instances, but yes. Grandma had  livestock, I think.  She had a hundred chickens at one time.  You know what a brooder house is?  No, I don   t.  Remember what I was saying about the brooder house? Well, see, in     They used to hatch their own chickens here.  See, and then there was a brooder hood, and it would be warm in the  winter. You   d get them sometime about now, I guess, the chickens. And  then at night, you   d go out there   I   ve done that with my  grandmother   and push them, be sure that they got under the brooder to  keep warm so they wouldn   t freeze. That   s what you called the brooder  because it was just the heating unit that kept the   and it was a little  18  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  house that you kept the chickens it. It wasn   t fun to clean the chicken  house or the brooder house, but those were things you did.  Would you use the waste for the garden?  No, it went on the wheat field.  Wheat field, okay.  My grandpa had a spreader, we called it.  I ran that thing very well.  You could put the waste in that and take it out and it   d spread it out over  the field. It had wheel-like thing that     I   ve still got that.  Yes, he does have that over there.  Allan, you seem to, even as a young boy, be very taken with farming. Did  you think you wanted to be a farmer when you got older?  Where I was going, I was actually going to veterinary medicine, and  that   s because of what I learned here. The year I graduated, I took the  MCAT test and that year, they were not accepting anything but out of  United States students all across the United States. So, at that point and  time, I went ahead and   Goodyear was just opening over here. I was  one of the first employees they hired. Stayed there for twenty-seven  years.  That was a good job, a good living. How you get     I was able to leave what I wanted to out there, the problem I had out  there, come home and do what I wanted to.  Was it hard to balance the farming and the job outside the farm?  To start with it was, but as time went on I was able to adapt and I had a  lot of good support in different places that I really needed. Of course, my  younger boys came on. They took to it like flies to honey. Both of them  are pretty good hands, now. They grew into it. My wife was very   she  grew up on a farm. She kind of had an idea of what needed to be done.  Whenever we didn   t do it right, we were told to redo it. And that   s  because of the   I have two   I was lucky, I had Wesley and my  grandfather. They kept you on the straight and narrow. If you made a  19  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  mistake, they   d correct it, tell you about it or tell you, and then you   d go  correct it.  But at the time, I did not have any plans on being   I wanted to be a vet,  but I was dealt different cards. So, you take them and roll with them. But  I did go back to the University of Memphis, what, four years ago? After  I retired from here. I went and studied under Dr. Peter Elsden who  developed the embryo-transfer at Colorado State University the year I  graduated. Very, very knowledgeable man. I went back there and  learned how to do the embryo transfer, which we are utilizing in our  operation today. It can take you from being ten years behind to be right  up in the front row real easy. I was offered a job to go to Dubai and do  embryo transfer with camels. Dr. Elsden called me on that one, and I  laughed and I said,    You   ve got to be kidding     He said,    No, your class  is one of the best ones that I ever had.    That made me feel good because  I was in there with four vets. One from Nebraska and one from the  University of Iowa State and there was another one from Penn State. The  guy that   s in there with me the same age as me was over the dairy herd  at the University of Michigan or Michigan State. So, I was in a very elite  group. We all worked together, and I learned a lot.  Dr. Elsden walked in on the last day of the class and threw all these  books on the table and said,    Now, if you went to the University of  Memphis to get your master   s, you can pay ten thousand dollars. Just  hand me what you owe me.    (Laughs) He was a good guy. I really  enjoyed it and learned a lot. It   s amazing how much things have not  changed, but how fast the technology has jumped from what you learned  when I was in school to what it is now. If you don   t stay on top of it,  you   re going to be behind.  So, you   re keeping up with the technology in your own operation today.  Yes. Matter of fact, had the first embryo calf of last  year . I put  embryos in last year and the first ET (embryo transfer) calf hit the  ground this morning. So, this is 146.  Wow.  So, the technology, if it   s out there you better use it because you   re  going to get left behind. This is another to talk about the difference in  years. I remember as a kid there was very little fertilizer put down. It  was all coming out of the chicken house or the cow pens or whatever.  Spread out on these fields with a manure spreader. Didn   t ever take a  soil test. Now, we take a soil test every year. It tells you what you need.  But that   s just the way things go. You   ve got satellite imagery right now.  You can see where your crops are weak, where they   re strong. I know  20  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Finchum  A. Barrington  Finchum  just in 1970 for instance, they could say,    Oh, it looks good,    and  wouldn   t get out in the middle of the field and do the soil test or look at  the crop. You   d go out there and it   d be great right around the edge and  in the middle there would be nothing. Now, you   ve got the satellite  imagery where you can actually see where your soil is weak and strong.  You can adapt the crops and do as you need to do.  And if you have the weather. Last summer was a scorcher that people  just didn   t even get their cotton up around here. It just didn   t sprout.  Did weather hit you hard last year?  Terrible.  Yes, we were able to save our herds, though. We   d saved three-quarters  of grass that we normally pasture at that time of year. I had the cattle  back on, just start rotating and moving them around where we could  kind of get those three-quarters. We had hay enough to get through.  We   re going to have hay enough this year to get through.  If you realize right now, our ponds are not full. So, we really need rain  to fill those ponds. We   re not into the   but, yes, if we have the weather  in the way that the technology is now   but they   re not giving diesel, and  they   re not giving fertilizer away right now. Oh, it   s higher than a cat   s  back. You know that because if you gassed your cars up today     I   ve got a price. We were going to fertilize. We put down weed killer  and sprayed for some bugs. I talked to the guy yesterday, twenty-one  dollars and fifty cents an acre.  And if you realize that you   re going to fertilize five hundred acres of  wheat what that   s going to cost you. And that   s before you harvest it,  and that   s all that goes into it. So, you need to figure what your price is  going to need to be before you get out.  And that was the cheap one. (Laughs)  So, you need other jobs.  Yes.  And an economics degree.  That   s what your degree is?  No, that   s what you need.  21  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Finchum  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Oh, basically, yes. Yes. But I   m really sad   you talked about that   I  was really sad that the agriculture industry right now is narrowing down.  I don   t see many kids involved in it, and it   s really sad because these  people in the United States are going to need to eat. They haven   t  figured that out yet.  Do you think it   s hard to be a farmer with smaller acreages?  I can say two things. Yes and no. Being the smaller part of it, you can  manage your things a lot easier. As far as the big operations, you   ve got  to hire X amount of people, and you   re not going to be able to   you   ve  got to pay wages, you   ve got to pay this, plus you   ve got your overhead.  If you can kind of keep it in the family where everybody kind of gets a  piece of the pie, it works better because you   ve trained them to know  what to look for. I wouldn   t want to be   right now, we   re at three  thousand acres. We   re small. I   ve got a neighbor that   s got 10,500. His  overhead is unbelievable. I love him to death, but I can   t see how he  does it. But he is scrambling every day to make ends meet.  Sure, yeah.  Mom mentioned that everybody in this family has an outside job. It  made it very easy for us to rob Peter to pay Paul sometimes. Now that  we   re where we   re at, everything is paid for. If you decide not to  fertilize, so be it.  You don   t get much crop.  You don   t get much crop, but your cattle on the other side of that picture  can take it and use it and do a better job of harvesting it than you can.  You   re going to get paid in the long run in those cattle. So, it   s kind of a  different operation.  Economically, right now, it is tough on the farmer, no kidding, as far as  the expense and the equipment cost that is prohibitive to buy. They don   t  give those tractors away. You know that. That   s like buying a house and  putting it out there.  If I can go back and ask, were involved in home demonstration clubs  or   ?  My wife is.  Yes, his wife should have come.  She   s supposed to be here, but...  22  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Finchum  J. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  A. Barrington  She   s held down, like he said, whenever he was at Goodyear, she helped  the boys with showing their cattle. He, too, I mean it was a joint effort  by everybody. As far as home demonstration clubs are concerned, those  of us like my mother and Mary Sue and I all had jobs. So, you didn   t get  into those clubs like the ladies that didn   t. But my grandmother  belonged.  But through the years, do you remember interactions with county  agents?  Yes, I do. The 4-H Club. I was in 4-H Club, yes. We had our 4-H  Club   in those days, in small schools we didn   t have big clubs like FFA  like we do. Well, some of the schools did, but Chattanooga didn   t. So,  we had our club, and our home demonstration agent would come and a  county agent, and we   d have our meetings. Our meetings, the home  demonstration, we   d have county meetings where you wear your  dresses. What did we call those? I   ve forgotten.  They had the dress revue.  Dress revue, yes. And we had your aprons, and we had all that as we  progressed. That   s what we did. Yes, and in the fall you went to the  county fair and took your canned goods, and I always won in my canned  goods. (Laughs)  I packed a few jars. But yes, it would be at the county fair. That was  before you were even a twinkle in my eye. Yes, we had all that.  Allan, do you have any interaction with county agents, today?  I never messed with county agents. I was an affiliate of the Lawton FFA,  and I never messed with the county agents. Now I   ve been involved with  them since here in Comanche County. We got a good one up here, Marty  New. He   s the one we take our soil samples to. His dad was an Ag  teacher whenever I was young. I never could get into the FFA in Duncan  for one reason, because my cattle were in Comanche County, and I was  in Stephens. I was in Duncan High School. Like I said, I became an  honorary Lawton FFA student.  What I learned as far as integrity and honesty was learned through the  guys that I went through when I traveled with them, and I was in with  them all the time. That was Marvin Bickett and my Uncle Wes. I saw  deals made on a handshake that at this day and time you would never do.  That is the deal I remember.  23  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  In Duncan, when I go over there, I still go over to the county agents and  get things that I want. He   s still got his office, there. Of course, he goes  to my church, too. So, I know that he   s still there.  I never will forget the year that we went to Dallas, though.  With FFA?  No, it was actually with the National Junior Angus Heifer Show. My  uncle had got into a deal with a bunch of ranchers over in the eastern  part of the state, and he had the bull that everybody wanted for some  reason. I was showing heifers out of that bull, and he had sent some out  to three other kids. He went to that show down there and he won two  divisions, five or six classes, came back that next year, and I never saw  the price of cattle go up like they did that year. But that   s how my uncle  made money with his cattle. He was very good.  And that   s Mary Sue   s husband.  Yes, he was very good at putting deals together.  And he lives here. This is where he lives.  And I will say this, I   m not as good as he was and I never will be, but he  knew how to play. I wish I did.  And he was a schoolteacher?  He was a vice-principal.  He was vice-principal at Tomlinson. Like I told you earlier, he and  Marvin Bickett, they thought they were the best. They named their  school farm after them, and it   s on the sign out there at the corner of Lee  and     Sheridan.     Sheridan Road.  Well, looking into the next one hundred years, what do you think will  happen to this piece of land or your centennial farm right here?  Well, we   ve discussed that from time to time, but Allan says that it will  go on. I worry because I see how things have   I mentioned a while ago,  I   m hoping that they get put back together because you can see things  falling apart. It needs to have some work done on it, but he says it will  24  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  stay. We   ve talked about that. You   ve said that, right? Hadn   t that been  pretty much it?  This place will stay the same. The others might change, but we   re going  to have to do a lot of rebuilding here. This is one hundred years of  deterioration.  And things have changed. Like the house itself has changed.  Here in this house, it needs some work done.  The chicken house out there, I hope it stays, but   now, my grandson  that I told you was out here, he got chickens about two years ago and I  thought,    Well, maybe they would have chickens.    But you know, you  have to take care of those chickens, and he wasn   t too good about  keeping the chickens cleaned out.  He didn   t know how to do it.  He really didn   t. So, there wasn   t anybody around, pretty much, to     She told you that she was falling over the hose and that hose was at the  chicken house. She was out there and so     She   d go out and take care of them.  It seems to be a strong emotional tie, family tie to this particular  property.  Well, there is. But time goes on.  This is home.  Any words of wisdom passed down?  Don   t ever put your land up for collateral. That   s the way we   ve  operated.  That   s been pretty much the advice.  Don   t ever put it up for collateral.  It was passed on down from everybody, don   t mortgage your land. You  might mortgage other things, but don   t mortgage your land. (Laughs)  Don   t mortgage your land or your cattle, because they   ll make you   money .  25  J. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Finchum  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  We haven   t got much else to mortgage. (Laughs)  But that   s been pretty much it.  What I just said was told to me by my great-grandfather and reiterated  by my grandfather, many times.  Of course, my daddy, his grandfather always said,    Just don   t spend  more than you make.     That   s true.  That   s kind of hard sometimes, but that was the big thing. Don   t spend  more than you make.  Very good advice. Well, is there anything else, any fond memories that  you   d like to share with us before we turn the recording off?  Well, of course, just having been brought up right here in the family,  that   s a fond memory. You   re right here, grandparents and parents, and  that   s no longer a thing. That   s a thing of the past.  Have you had your children get on a horse and find every nook and  cranny on the place?  Yes, Justin is quite the roper, and I don   t know where he got that from.  Anyway, he was a roper and he was, at one time, pretty well nationally  ranked. That   s when things started changing here because he got too  many horses in here, and horses are terrible at tearing things up. Both of  my boys, they know where I used to hide stuff    (Laughter)  Like I said earlier, I   m an only child, an only grandchild, and I was it as  far as   and then my two boys, and then I have three grandsons, two sons  and no daughters. It   s just two daughter-in-laws. Justin is the oldest  grandson so he was the one that came and started. When he got to be of  age, he moved out here into the little house. That   s how he kind of  brought in the horses and things. Then he got the mobile home. So, he is  the sixth generation of having lived here and has some livestock here.  Yes, and Cody has actually bought himself a home in Lawton, in town.  Cody is his younger son.  He is my youngest son. I   ve partnered up with him on quite a few things  to bring him along, get him back involved.  26  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Don   t know how it   s going to turn out.  Don   t know how it   s going to turn out because     He   s still young.     the two boys are as different as night and day.  And neither of them are married and neither of them   so, you know,  wives make a lot difference in how things go.  I was lucky. I married a farm girl.  And she   s been right there with him so that makes lots of difference.  One of my fondest memories is her and grandpa. (Laughs) I laugh at that  every time I think about it. I was working at Goodyear. I guess it was the  first two years I was working out there. I   d go to work from seven in the  morning to three in the afternoon. At three o   clock, I   d come home and  get on the tractor, whatever I needed to do. She and my grandpa decided  they were going to plow. I came home, and I was dreading getting on  that tractor because it was going to be a long   because I usually didn   t  get off until about ten o   clock at night, off the tractor. I come home and  they had both tractors over there and they   re just beaming sitting in the  gate. They   d finished that field and I went,    Thank god     (Laughter) I  remember that very well.  She   d get out there and work in the fields. Well, I did too, but that   s  beside the point.  Well, it   s a family affair. It takes everybody to get it done.  I remember she had a good tan that summer. (Laughter)  I know they put Justin, that   s the one that   s the grandson, here, he  learned how to drive the tractor when he was about five. We had those  fourteen-foot plows. If I were out plowing a hundred acre field over  there, I was always so glad to see Justin coming. We   d get through a lot  faster. (Laughs)  Yeah, Mom did. When Papaw passed, you jumped on that tractor.  I did. I did all that those years and sowed the wheat while you worked.  I remember I   d come in and get the ground ready the night before and  27  Finchum  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  J. Barrington  A. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  J. Barrington  Nykolaiszyn  you   d plant it. You used to keep me jumping.  Is it terraced? Did they do terracing?  Oh, yes. Justin learned how to plow terraces just like Mom did. There  was one field that I would mention, Jan and my grandfather had worked.  There were four terraces in that field, and it started back on the  southwest corner. There was twenty acres in it, and the next one down  there   s thirty-five, and then the next one there   s sixty. You jump down  to the bottom one, I think there   s thirty-five. I had just gotten the top  terrace done the night before, and they had gotten in there and done that  together, the rest of that. I hate plowing terraces. But if you don   t, your  fields are going to wash away. And then one of my other fondest  memories is the day I won classes down in Dallas that year with Wesley.  I thought he was going to do handstands walking down the aisle with  that calf.  But no, those years after my dad passed away     You talk about something changing.  I mean, I did, I sowed wheat for every year there, up until the boys and  you got to where you were able to take it over and plow it. They always  called my disk     You did.  I   d disk, and they   d call it my Dicky Disk because that   s what I     (Laughs)  That   s because John Deere put a book out that had Corny the Corn  Picker and Dicky Disk.  I did, and I bought that    94 tractor.  We all had a good time. We were able to laugh at each other, cry,  wanted to kick each other in the teeth, but it   s family.  Yes, that   s what it   s about.  Is there anything else that you need to know?  Well, we appreciate your time today. Thank you for just giving us a little  glimpse of your life here on the farm. Thank you.  -------  -------  28
