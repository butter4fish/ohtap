 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also joining me as an interviewer today is Tanya Finchum.  Today is Wednesday, May 27, 2009 and we   re in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma interviewing Vernon Askew and his sons Alan and Andy. Mr.  Askew is owner of the Isaac Favor Farm. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral  History Project. Thank you for joining me today. Well let   s begin by  learning how your family came to own the farm.  My wife   s family originally settled there in the Land Run of 1889.  However, her great-great-grandfather picked out the land, the original  160 acres. When we were married in 1955, the first place that she took  me   well actually it was before we were married, more like the first  date, when I came over from Stillwater to visit her, she took me out to  the original homestead to meet her grandmother who was still living at  that time on the farm. When my wife   s mother and father passed away,  she got the 110 acres, the additional part that had been added. My  brother-in-law got the 210 acres, which included the original homestead.  The Isaac, as you mentioned, was the original homesteader. And her  brother-in-law, who inherited that 210 acres, was killed in Texas by a  gyrocopter crash that he had made. I made her an offer to buy the 210  acres. Come to find out, she did not own the full 210. There are two  widows: one lives in New Orleans, she   s a widow of Dick Favor, and  another that has 1/8th interest in the 210 acres. The other widow lives in  Tulsa and she is the widow of Bill Favor. It was not an investment that I  expected to reap any great monetary reward for, but it was an investment  that my children could say    my great-great-great-grandfather  homesteaded this place.    Not too many people around can say that  nowadays, so that   s how I came to have it.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  And do your recall where Mr. Favor came from originally?  I believe that Isaac Favor came from New Hampshire. Originally   you  mean real originally   England. I have a genealogy book. Would you  want to turn off your recorder over there and I   ll get it and let you see it?  Well we can do that after the interview if you like.  Okay, but it is full of stuff.  Now the way they tell the story was, when Isaac got there, someone else  was already on the land, because he was a little bit late, and he traded  them his milk cow and his shot gun for the land.  And two sacks of feed. And he left his son, which would be our great-great-  grandfather   he wasn   t very old, he was 14 or 15   on the  homestead to take care of it, told the people that had homesteaded next  door that he was going to leave him there, and then he rode into Guthrie  to officially make the claim.  Well do you recall the original structures that were on the land during  Mr. Favor   s time?  Originally I think it was a dugout they had in the very beginning, and  then they built a log cabin somewhere after that.  And it burnt down. And then the farmhouse that we knew burnt down in  February from the grass fires that we were having at that particular time.  I would like to ask Alan, on the 110 acres, do you remember any stories  about the ownership thereof and the visitors?  Yeah, it was owned by Clarence Simmons.  This is the quarter section that   s just east of the homestead.  Right, this is not the original homestead. It   s what we own now. It   s  what my grandfather bought. And there was a man named Clarence  Simmons that lived there, and the story goes, he did a little cattle  wrestling and was in with some bank robbers and in with the Daltons. So  the story goes that whenever the Daltons were there, they   d raise a flag  and everybody knew to stay away. But if you go to all the history books,  they say that the Daltons never were around that area, but then that   d  kind of coincide with why that was their hideout because you know, they  never pulled any bank robberies or anything like that.  Now back in the early 70s, his granddaughter was going to write a book  about it, about his history. I don   t know that she ever did it; I   ve tried to  6  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Google Clarence Simmons    name and never came up with anything on  that. But on the documentation we have, he had several aliases. I think  he had four or five different aliases on the land deed when my  grandfather bought the land from him. But that   s the famous story.  Now what Lewis showed me   and I know you   ve seen it to   is where  supposedly they had their dugout. There was something there, there was  a dugout or some kind of structure. You can see it   s like a double dugout  in the shape of a W where the walls would be. And what he told me also  was that the Daltons had built a bridge, a small bridge, over the stream  that ran real close to it. And when I was probably oh seven or eight years  old, Alan and our grandfather were cutting firewood. The level of the  lake was real low and Lewis showed me where the stones were, and it  looked like the foundation for a little bridge, right close to where the  dugout was supposed to have been. So I think Lewis    account of that is  pretty accurate.  Well that   s just fascinating.  And it   s in between Guthrie and Kingfisher, sort of. And from what I   ve  read, that   s kind of where they were a lot of the time, and so it would  make a whole lot of sense that they would have some place somewhere  around there to get away. (Laughs)  Well tell me about other features of the land that you remember growing  up.  Well, the home place has a decent sized pond on it. And I believe Lewis,  he had that dam built, is that right?  Probably in the    50s.  The home place? No, it was built earlier than that. The east place, that  dam was built in the    50s. I know because when my wife and I got  married, I was out at the farm with Lewis and he mentioned the fact that  the big lake didn   t have any fish in it because he had just built this dam a  couple of years before. So shortly thereafter, he gathered up all of the  milk cans in Crescent that he could find and lowered them in a pickup  and we went up to a little town north of Crescent, which was called  Marshall. And there was a relative of Lewis Favor   s that was going to  fill in his lake. I was a city kid from Oklahoma City and I had never  really been around farms or lakes, but anyway, I got to go in the farm  pond and take a seine with me to seine fish so that we could transfer  them over to the 110 acres    lake. The state has a hatchery, but as most  state laws do, they didn   t plan it very well, the legislature, because if you  got your fish from the state fish hatchery, you had to let anybody and  7  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  everybody on that land fish because originally they were state-owned  fish. We were not in the mood to do so, so that   s why we seined the fish  to put in that lake. That was in the early    50s. The one on what we call  the home place, the 160 acres, was done in the late teens or early    20s.  And they were both dams built by the agriculture department.  It was the Army Corps of Engineers that Lewis had. They were wanting  to establish more ponds in the area.  Right, all over the country, shortly after the Land Run.  Well they were wanting to establish more so they would come out and  do it for you, but they wanted to do it their way.  Yeah.  And Lewis didn   t quite agree with the way they wanted to do it, but  went ahead and had them build the dams the way they wanted. And then  I know on the East place that was originally the Simmons   , he had a guy  come in later with a dozer and change the path of the spillway because  he knew it wouldn   t last. They didn   t put it over rock is what he told me,  so he had it moved to where it was over rock and it   s been there for  however long it   s been there now, perfectly fine. You want to tell them  about the house on the home place? I know Lewis     You tell it.  I don   t know when. Do you know when he moved it?  No.  Well our great-grandmother wanted to live out at the farm, and so I  don   t know when, but he did it with mules. They had cut the house in  two and moved it on wagons with mules for her to live in out there on  the farm. I think he got a lot of grief about, couldn   t do that, it wasn   t  something that would work, but he made it work.  Well his father-in-law was a contractor, and he told him that once he cut  that house in two he   d never get it back together. And he said when they  slid it up next to each other, it just went back perfectly.  Yeah, and it was there for a really long time until the brushfires we had  about six months or so ago burnt in down.  Yeah, in February.  8  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  The spillway on the original homestead has washed out over the years  and I haven   t seen it in several months. Have you seen it?  Well, it   s about to wash out. It hasn   t completely.  Yeah. But about six years ago, I contacted the agriculture department in  Guthrie, Oklahoma and the fellow that I had talked to (I have his name  but I don   t have it in my mind) came out and I showed him the spillway  and how bad a shape it was in. I had talked to a couple of contractors  and they were talking like  20,000,  25,000. Well the government was  not really interested in repairing the spillway. What he wanted to do and  what he talked about was cutting cedar trees. They want to cut cedar  trees and that   s their main interest today. I understood that I would have  to pay 50  of whatever it cost for them to cut the cedar trees and repair  the spillway. And when he said 50  I wanted to know 50  of what.  I remember one story that Lewis told me about, I think it was Lewis     father, Alan, that they nicknamed Judge Favor because he wore the     I think that was his grandfather.  Was it his grandfather? They had nicknamed Judge Favor   Favor  wasn   t a judge   because of the kind of hat that he wore. It was a black  top hat, wasn   t it?  Yes.  And the story that I was told, he was a bit of a politician but he really   it  was kind of a hobby. He   d go hang out in Guthrie just to kind of   it was  his hobby. And I remember a story and a little bit of a dispute between  Simmons and Favor about there were some problems with some cattle or  goats or something, wasn   t there?  I remember Lewis and Orpha telling me a story about for a little while  there was a little bit of bad blood between the two families because some  cattle or other livestock were getting across the fence and they had a  little bit of an argument about it and that kind of thing going on.  (Laughs)  Now our great-grandfather, he was County Commissioner at the time  they built the courthouse in Guthrie so his name is on the outside of the  courthouse.  Back on the farm during the old days, what crops and livestock were  around?  9  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  We weren   t around, so we don   t know. (Laughter)  Well they did raise wheat and of course they raised a garden. And they  farmed with mules, but it wasn   t the greatest ground to grow wheat on  so that didn   t last too long. I know my grandfather was kind of left there  to work the farm because his dad was County Commissioner so he was  gone, you know, all over the county doing his job. So I know there for  several years when he was a kid he was running the farm and going to  school.  And they at some point had a mortgage on the home place and what I  remember Lewis saying is that he had paid it off while going to school,  working at the grocery store in Crescent. He had paid off that mortgage  while putting himself through school.  But I mean they probably had pigs too, you know. And just like  everybody did back then, all the neighbors all worked together so if they  butchered a calf, everybody got some of the meat then the next time  they   d take turns. Same way with hogs and chickens, they   d all get  together when they scalded hogs and made soap. But back then they all  worked together.  Lewis Favor, their grandfather, my wife   s father, always had a garden  someplace. I had an office in Oklahoma City, my accounting office, and  there were two acres of land that came with my office and it was about  4,000 square feet. He came down in the summertime and had a  vegetable garden out behind my office and that was his way of doing  things. He liked to be active, but he liked for it to pay off. And I know  my wife and I got quite a few vegetables out of that garden. Not that we  asked for them, but he gave them to us. So that is a basic type of  character that all of the Favors that I have known over the years   my  wife and I were married 49 years and 11 months and I had met most of  the Favors by then, and they were hard-working individuals and they  took care of their families. And that was a trait that was displayed, so  Isaac may not have picked out a favorable farmland to build his future  on, which was very short, but look at the ancestors that he left in this  world to grow up. He was a very successful person.  Now the garden they had originally, is that where it is now?  It may   ve been.  Yeah.  It would make sense to me.  10  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Alan Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  But the log cabin set back towards the creek back behind where the  corral used to be, from what Lewis told me.  Yeah, yeah. Now once they built a house, is that the one where   was it  Bill that was playing with matches?  I think it was Dick.  Was it Dick? Playing with matches as a kid and burned the place down.  Actually I think that was the log cabin that he burned down.  Was it? Okay, okay. So a little episode with that.  Was there a barn on the old homestead?  We built a barn in the    70s out there that also burnt down, but as far as I  can remember there wasn   t ever a barn. There was another structure  there, and of course there was a chicken coop and an outhouse, but I  don   t ever remember them having ever built a big barn.  Any stories from the time when they received electricity for the first  time?  Well there   s a story from when   was it Ray? Well you go ahead.  Well it was the Rays, which was my grandmother   s maiden name, and  they just lived a couple of miles north of where my grandfather lived.  And the story goes they were the first to have the electricity in the  county out there and of course it was 12-volt electricity. And they had a  little wind generator out there so they could run a few lights and run the  radio. But they charged batteries kind of like the way the solar panels do  now.  If you   ll look at your map that I furnished you where the Favor farm  was, just south of there it says    Max Ray Trustees.    So that is where  their grandmother was raised. And then up on the Favor farm, that was  where their grandfather was raised, which you   ll notice in this interview,  you   ve never heard the word, other than I said, grandmother and  grandfather. My children never called their grandparents    grandma    or     grandpa.    They called them by their first name, Lewis and Orpha. That  was encouraged by their grandparents, to be called by their first name by  their grandchildren. So that gives you another indication of how great  the Favor families were.  Well my grandmother, she didn   t want to be called grandmother because  11  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  she didn   t think she was old. If you were called grandmother that means  you were old and she didn   t think she was old. But whenever they   d get  together and talk about all those other old people, what those old people  were doing, well those people were the same age they were, but they  didn   t consider t themselves old. (Laughter)  The schoolhouse   now did Lewis, that one that is still standing, did he  go to school there or did he teach there?  No, where they went to school is about a mile from where   no, they  walked to a school, both Lewis and Orpha did. And it   s about a mile  down from where Orpha lived, a mile east. There   s not a schoolhouse  there anymore but that   s where they went to school and they also taught  school there, both of them taught school in one-room schoolhouses. We  can show you where it   s at, but there   s nothing there anymore.  Now I think Lewis taught at the one that   s still standing.  He may have.  There   s one that   s just a mile or so northeast of the home place. But it   s  still standing. It   s stone and I think that   s where he taught, at least for a  little while.  Now one story my grandfather does tell about the Depression, he said  that they didn   t really realize there was a Depression going on because  everybody around them was in the same situation, and so they just  thought that   s the way life was. They heard there was a Depression, but  they just thought that was the way of life.  Now, were Lewis and Orpha able to make a living on the farm or did  they have to supplement their income by teaching?  In their adult years they always were school teachers. They never did  actually farm other than run cattle out there.  And then later on, Lewis bought the Chevrolet dealership that was in  Crescent and ran that for a little while to put his kids through college. He  (Vernon) worked for them for a little while after you (Vernon) and Mom  got married. He sold that and when Mom and Dad moved to Oklahoma  City, Lewis and Orpha moved up here too. Orpha taught in Putnam City  schools and Lewis was a teacher and a principal and he was Director of  Transportation for Putnam City schools for a little while.  Alan, would you like to tell them who your third-grade teacher was?  12  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Evidently I don   t know who it was.  I think he   s saying it was Orpha. Do you remember that? Did she ever  teach a class you were in?  I don   t believe she was my third-grade teacher.  Well     You might be thinking about Annette.  His third-grade teacher was his grandmother.  We   ll go back and check the documentation on that. (Laughter)  I know that Orpha     She taught in the same grade school that I went to, she was a teacher  there.  When I went there everybody still knew her. And they lived right behind  where the school was, and so I couldn   t much get away with anything  where Lewis and Orpha wouldn   t hear about it and that was real bad. I  didn   t want them to know I was anything but an angel.  Well we lived in Windsor Hills addition and the grade school was about  two blocks from our house. So when they sold their Chevrolet  dealership, they moved to Oklahoma City and Orpha was teaching at  that Windsor Hills school. And our oldest daughter, Annette, got mad at  her mother one day I can remember and ran away to her grandmother   s  house, which was about maybe four blocks from where we lived.  I think we all did that at one time or another. (Laughs)  Well, I didn   t know about you.  No, I was mad at you, not Mom. (Laughter)  Okay. But our family and their family, we raised our family to be  respectful and courteous to their elders. They forgot that mostly when I  came, you know. I can do no right any more at my age. (Laughter)  We just traded places. (Laughter)  We   re talking about the home place being not the greatest farmland, but  you know they got by. It had water on it, which was really important.  13  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Finchum  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  And not all the homesteads out there did, so I think that was something  that was really important for them.  Do you recall spending any holidays on the farm?  Oh yeah. Well my birthday is July 6 and so as a kid I always remember  we   d go up to the farm on July Fourth, well they   d have my birthday  there at the same time. And I probably would   ve told you for a little  while that it was all about me. But yeah, I remember going up there just  so many times with Lewis and Orpha and fishing with Lewis.  Well they were school teachers, so the three months in the summer we  basically lived out there.  I remember sitting on the porch of the house snapping green beans with  my grandmother. And you wouldn   t think that a little seven or eight year  old boy would enjoy doing that, but if I was doing that with my  grandmother it was alright. I remember it used to be a lot bigger when I  was little kid. We   d go for a walk around the home place pond or  something and you might as well have been a thousand miles away from  any place. Your imagination as a little kid really gets going.  Would Orpha can?  A little bit, yeah. What I remember about canning is that Lewis would  grow green beans in the garden and Orpha would can them and then get  those out for Thanksgiving or Christmas. And there was something so  much better about them. She   d put a little bacon in them and that kind of  thing, I remember that. I remember going out and staying in the house  out at the home place with them and sleeping in the living room on the  couch. I would   ve been five or seven years old, somewhere around  there, and you could hear the mice running up inside the walls of the  house. And that was 35 years ago.  Did it have indoor plumbing at that time?  Yeah, they had indoor plumbing and it was a   that stove was a gas  stove? Yeah, it was a gas stove.  It was electric.  Was it electric?  They got indoor plumbing probably in the very early    70s. Before that  there was an outhouse.  14  Finchum  Alan Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Is it still standing?  Nope.  Well as little boys, what else do you remember doing for fun when you  would go out to the old home place? Causing trouble?  We never caused any trouble. (Laughter) But we had tree houses and  you know.  They both would move out to the farm. The one problem that they both  have about doing that is their wives would not move with them.  Well, depends on how you look at that. (Laughter)  I   ll tell a little story on myself. One time I was probably seven and I was  on the home place pond. We had a flat-bottom John boat out there and I  was by myself and I was fishing. For some reason I had a little string of  Black Cat firecrackers and my BB gun. And I   d fish for a little while,  get bored with that, I   d pop a firecracker, get bored with that, I   d shoot  the BB gun for a minute, get bored with that, and go back to fishing. I  did this over and over for a little while. You know, it   s heaven for a  seven year old boy. I had laid the little pump that I was using to light the  firecrackers down on the seat of the boat and it rolled over to the string  of Black Cats. Well when they went off, I went out and into the lake and  then crawled back in. When I got back up to the house, I   m dripping wet  and Orpha asked me,    Well what happened?    And I don   t remember  what I told her, but I   m pretty sure I told her a fib, but I knew that she  knew,    He fell in the lake, it doesn   t matter. He   s up here at the house,  he   s still alive, everything   s okay.    (Laughs) He  Alan  fell in a few  times as a little kid, had to get plucked out. But you know, I guess the  strongest memory I have is my grandfather always out there fishing. He  loved to go fishing in that pond. I mean, that   s it. He loved to do that.  Vernon, tell me how you met your wife?  How I met my wife. I had been in Korea during the Korean War. I got a  free trip to Japan and I was in the Army, a Master Sergeant, at the age of  20.  That   s cause he lied about his age to get into the National Guard.  Yeah, I did.  Cause they paid you. (Laughter)  15  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Let   s just get it all out there.  You gotta tell the whole story   This is one troublesome   I didn   t anticipate. But anyway, I came home  from Korea. My mother lived on a farm up by Hunter, Oklahoma, which  is close to Enid. I was not married, I didn   t have a job. I had sent all my  money home to my mother and she bought cattle. Well, when I came  home, you just don   t go out and sell cattle. You gotta wait until the  market   s good, so basically I didn   t have any money. I discovered that  the government would pay for an education to a service person at that  time. It was all tuition and books and  100 a month. So the closest  college to where my mother lived was Stillwater   Oklahoma  Agricultural and Mechanical College. So I decided to go to school there.  The  100 in those days did not go very far as far as dates are concerned,  but I joined a fraternity and right across the street was a sorority house.  And I noticed this blonde several times and finally I had a friend in the  fraternity house who had a girlfriend in the Delta Zeta house and he  arranged for  him and  his girlfriend to  go with me and  my date on a  double date thing. And that   s how I met my wife. We went together     well she was a year ahead of me. She was four years younger, but  because I was 20 years old before I started to college, cause the people  that I knew in high school were already halfway through college, but  that   s how we met.  And that was Radine and     Radine and Fred   well, Radine and Fred were the other partners in this  double dating thing. Unfortunately, he passed away with cancer at age  25, just after he graduated from college.  Now, they introduced you that time but they introduced you another  time, too.  Cause she didn   t think too much of you in the beginning.  Yeah, you gotta tell the whole story   This is a problem with elder children. (Laughter) They get you in a  position to     Tell the truth.     embarrass you. And they go with it.  Do you want to tell it or should I? My version might be better, I don   t  16  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  know.  Well, she can always delete anything. So go ahead.  Well, now at the time, were you and Mom going steady or were you just  dating or what was the story?  I don   t know.  The story was he was playing the field, wasn   t it?  Yeah. He went to an out-of-town football game with another girl. And  Mom had a friend of hers that was a cheerleader at the time and spotted  this and let her know. Well he was done after that. That was it.  Yeah. Well, okay, I remember that now. (Laughter) I don   t remember  who the girl was, but     And what happened was, Fred and Radine had a party about a year later.  And I think they had a sense that they needed a second shot at things,  and so they invited both Mom and Dad to this party without telling the  other one that they were going to be there. And he got his second  chance, am I right?  You   re telling the story.  You got your second chance and the rest was history.  Yeah, I guess so. Anyway     You want to tell them about your first date?  No. (Laughter)  Now there   s nothing wrong with that.  Like I say, I think I   m repeating myself now, but we were married 49  years and 11 months to the day. And it was     Well, Dad, tell them about your first date because that   s interesting.  They   ll want to hear about that, when you drove into Crescent, picked  her up, drove down to Oklahoma City to the amusement park.  Well, what   s the name of that amusement park? It   s still out there. I  can   t think of the name of it. Oh, she had told me that she was going to  Colorado to summer school the next day so we went to this amusement  17  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  park and she rode some of the rides, she didn   t want to ride them all. But  anyway, my automobile at that time was like a    36 Chevrolet and that  was in the    50s. It was not very speedy. So we had dinner and then we  started up to Crescent and I think my top speed was like 25, 30 miles an  hour. And we drove up to her house and I walked her to the door and  told her goodnight. Then later I discovered that her father was still up  and her mother too, and it was after midnight. She didn   t even get to  change clothes because he got her in the car and started for Colorado  that night, right after she walked in the door. Is that what you   re talking  about?  Well, yeah. And you were doing something for the 5th infantry, weren   t  you?  Not that I remember.  Okay I thought you went that summer and did something with them  while she was in Colorado.  Sure, you went to summer camp.  Yeah, in the National Guard we   d go to camp every summer.  Right. And then she came back to school, to Stillwater?  Yeah. Yeah. We have a genealogy book, in fact we have two of them for  the Favor name and especially Isaac, got a good article about him.  Photographs of my children are on top of the piano there and my oldest  daughter, like I think I said before, died last July of cancer.  She did a lot of work with our mom, looking up the information, a lot of  time in the libraries.  Grandmother also actually started it.  Annette was my oldest daughter   s name and one year at the state fair,  she entered some of her work that she had done for the genealogy and  she won a medal for that.  Well did your wife enjoy going out to the old home place?  Oh yes. Yes, she enjoyed it up to a point. She did not want to live there.  But yes, it was a privilege that she had in growing up to go out and see  her grandmother, who was living on the home place at that time.  And over time, were many of the Favor family born on the home place,  18  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  that you know of?  Yes, because you didn   t have a hospital. In fact, I think there were five  boys and one girl of my father-in-law   s generation that were born on that  home place, yes.  You speak very fondly about your grandparents. Did they pass down any  words of wisdom to you through the years that you remember?  I remember one time both Alan and I were with Lewis riding out to the  farm. I was a little kid and driving down the road, we looked over at our  fence and somebody had stolen a whole bunch of the fence posts out of  it. Not every other one or anything like that, there was just whole lengths  that all the fence posts were missing. And I remember Lewis told me,     Well, I guess they needed them worse than we did.    And that   s kind of  how he looked at things. By the time I knew him, he never really got  excited about stuff. He was really   I don   t know, just really easy going.  Well he had been through hard times so he didn   t sweat the little stuff.  Yeah, it was no big deal. And whatever was going on, there was always  a way to deal with it.  Their grandparents would take in some cases when you  Andy  were still  a little kid, they   d take the three older children and go away for two  weeks. And then when he got older and he went with them, they   d take  all four kids and go, to Colorado, wherever.  I spent a lot of time over at Lewis and Orpha   s house after school,  because the grade school I went to was just right there. So I   d walk over  there and stay there for an hour or two after school every day till my  mom came by and picked me up.  I could not have had any better in-laws. I was lucky with my wife, but  I   ve heard of having bad in-laws, wanting to live your life and all that.  Well they never wanted to live our lives, but they wanted to be with us.  And so I was very lucky, not only in choosing a wife   I like to say I  chose her   also her mother and father were just real good.  Lewis had a way, and we   ve all, Annette, Angela, Alan and I have all  talked about this, he had a way of talking to us. He was a teacher,  principal, worked a lot with kids, but then he was also our grandfather.  And he had a way of, if you did something wrong, the last person in the  world that you wanted to know about it was Lewis. Not because you   d  get in trouble or anything like that, but because you didn   t want to  disappoint him. He just had a way. He could talk to you and tell you how  19  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  disappointed he was in what you did. And you   d much rather get  spanked or something, that was just   to disappoint Lewis was really  bad. You   ve got a story about Lewis and the bus.  Oh, when he was Director of Transportation of Putnam City Schools,  our bus driver, I don   t know, got mad at the kids on the bus. They were  making too much noise or something. So anyway, he just pulled over  and made everybody get off. Well that   s a big no-no so he asked me  about it and I just told him what happened. And evidently the bus driver  didn   t know that one of his grandkids rode that bus. So I don   t believe he  did that any more.  Well there was something about you got in trouble and didn   t want  Lewis to know about it?  But no, the one funny thing about my grandparents was that my  grandmother was probably 5 foot tall and my grandfather was probably  6   3   . But my grandmother, she was really fiery, and we   d get ready to  go out there to Crescent on the weekends and I would go with them and  whatever we were going to do, build a fence or paint, boy she   d tell him  exactly how he ought to do it and he said,    Okay, yeah, yeah we   ll do  that.        Yes, dear.     And she   d say,    And you take Alan into town and you get him a good  lunch.    And he   d just say,    Okay, yeah we   ll do that.    So we   d leave  and on the way out there, he   d say,    Well, do you want to stop and get  hot dogs and build a fire and roast hot dogs or do you want to go to  town?    And of course any kid   s going to say,    Roast hot dogs, build a  fire.    He said,    Okay, don   t you tell your grandma. You just tell her that  we went to town if she asks and had a good meal.    (Laughter) And so  that   s just always the way their relationship was. Boy, she   d just tell him  how it ought to be done. He   d just agree with her, and then go about  doing it however he was going to do it in the beginning.  And everything was okay.  Yep.  And he did the same thing with me, with the,    Where do you want to go  eat?    It was always beans and hot dogs by the lake, yeah.  Well tell me about the farm today. What   s going on on the farm?  Well we use it pretty much for recreation. Hunt and fish and cut fire  20  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Alan Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  wood. In the past it   s been leased.  The pasture.  The pasture   s been leased for cattle. Currently it   s not. But it   s a  getaway. Getaway from   the job I have is all technology, computers  and everything. I like going out there and just dropping that completely.  The memories that are part of it make it special.  He is self-employed, a computer technician deluxe. What do you do?  I   m watching after my father. (Laughter)  But we enjoy just being out there.  When I get old, you can do that.  Well, I hate to tell you, but you   re there. (Laughter)  Oh boy.  And like Dad said, I know my wife would move out there with me, but  it   s a matter of economics. If there was a way where we could both be  able to keep our careers and the type of employment that we   ve got and  live out there and afford to, I don   t think there would be just a whole lot  of     Technology   s coming.  Yeah. I don   t think there   d be a whole lot of question about it. It   s just a  special place to us.  So where do you see the farm going in the next 100 years?  Well I won   t have a say in where it goes but maybe for the next 30 or 40  years. Beyond that, who knows. Well, there   s kind of an unwritten rule  among everybody that it stays in the family. It won   t be sold, it won   t be  anything like that. We   ll do everything we can to keep it.  Well if you had some grandchildren, you could leave it to them. But  first, I   ve got to have some grandchildren before I can. And you two.  I didn   t see that coming at all. (Laughter)  Oh no, we never expected that.  21  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  We never hear that.  Yeah. My wife and I had four children, but we deserved some  grandchildren. I   m still waiting.  Well, you   ve shared lots of great memories of your time on the farm and  the old home place. Are there any other memories you   d like to share  with us in closing?  Well I think we have lots of memories. I recall one year   we always  tried to go someplace, usually when we had four children at home we  had a station wagon so everybody had plenty of room to ride. And there  was one year that I had used up   I had worked for Blue Cross, but I had  used up my vacation time doing something else. I was going to summer  camp with the National Guard, so my wife and I decided that we would  have our vacation in Oklahoma City. We would plan to pretend that our  home was a motel and that every day when I got off from work, we  would go out and we would go to the amusement park out east of town,  we would go to shows, we would go   it was during the summertime so  the kids were not in school and they could sleep as late as they wanted to  during the day, but I got the general impression that they enjoyed having  vacation in Oklahoma City because we went places that normally we  would not have gone. And that   s a good memory for me. But you guys  will have to talk for yourselves.  Well I remember   you know there   s just so many. I remember in the  summertime going with Lewis and Orpha and picking some kind of  berry that Orpha would make     Sand plums.  Was it sand plums? That Orpha would make preserves out of or jelly.  And pecans, I remember going and picking up pecans with them. The  church that I went to as a little kid every once in a while, they would  have a group go out to the farm and Lewis and Orpha would kind of host  the kids out there and people would go fishing and I think they camped  out a little bit sometimes. A lot of time it just kind of revolved around  being out there with Lewis and Orpha. One time when I was going to  school at that grade school, I honestly made a mistake about a day that  we were going to have off from school. I told my mom that and she said,     Okay.    And Lewis was going out to the farm, so I went with him out to  the farm. Well while we   re at the farm of course the school calls and  Mom says,    No, school wasn   t closed today.    I spent the day out there  with him and when we came back, I guess Mom had called Orpha and  talked to her about it. And when I got home, Orpha told me that,    Your  mom wants to talk to you. The school wasn   t really closed today.    But  22  Alan Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  she told me,    You know, it   s okay. You probably learned more from  your grandfather today than you would   ve if you   d gone to school.    You  know, that   s just kind of the way that     Cause we could do no wrong in her eyes.  Yeah.  Another memory, we traveled quite a bit when we could afford it. My  wife and I have been to England, to Paris, to Alaska, to Russia, to Japan,  Korea, Hawaii. One of the biggest thrills I had was going through the  Panama Canal. And when I was in high school, we studied the Panama  Canal to death. We knew how many pounds of earth had to be moved  and the number of people that had yellow fever and all kinds of real  important things. So we left from Fort Lauderdale, went down to the  Caribbean, went to a couple of islands, went to Colombia, and then we  headed towards the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal does not go east  and west, it goes north to south. You think that they could   ve built it, but  that wasn   t the way it was built. It was built going from north to south.  So I was real thrilled about the Panama Canal. I went up on the top deck,  I had a hat, and I would cross from one side to the other so I would not  miss anything. We stopped in the country of Panama. We could not get  off the boat, but anyway, I got sun stroke. I went back to my cabin and  laid down, and we had TVs up on the upper deck that we could watch  what was happening, so I got to watch. I didn   t get to go on shore, but I  got to watch it in my air conditioned room. And to me, that was one of  the biggest things that she and I did together was travel. You know we  couldn   t always afford it, or it wasn   t convenient but like the vacation in  Oklahoma City, we enjoyed it.  Having lived through the Depression, one thing that Orpha, our  grandmother always did, was she saved everything to the day that she  died, she saved everything. And when we had to move her out of the  house that they had to an assisted living center, you know she had saved  everything. And that   s how they got by was by being very frugal. And  you know, Lewis and Orpha, they were very simple, but they did what  they needed to do for their families.  I can remember something else. Mr. Favor died a few years before she  did so she wanted to move out of her house and move to an assisted  living area. We found one in Yukon. And her birthday, was it 90?  Oh are you talking about the balloon?  Yeah.  23  Andy Askew  Vernon Askew  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Askew  I think she was 92.  92 years old and we asked her what she wanted to do on her 92nd  birthday.    I want to take a balloon ride.    Well Andy had been with a  friend whose father had a balloon and I also knew in a breakfast club, so  I made arrangements for him to bring his balloon over. And the first  time the weather wasn   t right, so we put it off. The second time, a lot of  the people who lived in this assisted living area were out, going to watch  the balloon and Orpha Favor was going to ride in it. So she was the  queen of the day. Andy went with her for this balloon ride and we  followed along in the car. And she had finally put it down on the ground,  it was a little bit rougher landing than she had expected, but you were  there to catch her. But we drove back to the assisted living area and she  was the queen because she got to ride in a hot air balloon and they  didn   t. So you know, it was a good feeling.  Well these are all very good memories. Thank you so much for taking  time out of your day to share them with us and talk about your family  and time spent on the old homestead. We really appreciate it.  It   s our privilege and thank you for coming to my home from that great  institution called Oklahoma State University. I graduated from  Oklahoma A M and so did my wife. And my oldest daughter had a  teaching degree from Oklahoma State University. And then she had a  master   s degree in education from Shippensburg University in  Pennsylvania.  -------  -------
