 Finchum  Ray  Today is May 7, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m here with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn, and we   re with the Oklahoma State University  Library conducting an oral history project called Oklahoma Centennial  Farm Families. We   re in Atoka, Oklahoma, today with Thomas Tinker  Ray. Thank you for having us. Let   s start by having you tell us how your  family initially came to have this piece of land.  Our people trace back to Indian heritage. The Indian name was  Smallwood. They migrated here from Mississippi in 1863 through the  Trail of Tears. Later, my great-grandfather married Susan Smallwood,  and their daughter, Mary Dillon, married W. B. Ray, which came up out  of Texas. The story goes, it   s probably correct, that this was all Indian  land then. It wasn   t privately owned. It was tribal land, and W.B. Ray  drove cattle up in this country. To get grazing rights on the Indian land  he married a little fourteen-year-old girl and was establishing this deal.  Then in 1906 or    07 the land was allotted and given rights to it, and so  that   s how this ranch was started. It originated from tribal lands to  deeded ownership as allotments.  And the Smallwoods were the Indians?  Right.  What tribe?  Choctaws. My father was an enrollee of the Choctaw tribe.  And how large was the land to begin with, acreage?  The acreage, when it was allotted, they usually allotted about 220 acres  to a person. Before that, there was really no boundary. When it was open  range, it was just kind of a neighborly-type thing. You run cattle just  about as far as you wanted to and the neighbors did, too. So the actual  5  Finchum  Ray  boundaries were quite a bit more than it is now, but when they allotted     my father received an allotment, and his mother received an allotment  and so did all the other kids. It was usually around 200 and some odd  acres per person. It was kind of odd in going back, chasing the  allotments. They didn   t put it all together. They might have put 150 here  and another twenty off somewhere else or something like that. I was real  surprised when I got to tracing down the allotments. Where we   re sitting  now was my grandmother   s allotment. My father   s allotment is across  the road on the north side. So, that   s how we came out with this land.  Then in the    30s,    29,   30s, the banks collapsed and everybody lost about  everything they had, and there were foreclosures and everything else.  My people were able to squat here and hang on and finally get it back, in  terms of the situation. Never did get all of the old range back. My  brother and I have continued to acquire and put it back together. Of  course, through marriages and other kids, well, it has been split off, but  there are still parts of it, the north part. My cousins still have a lot of the  old rights, too.  On the original part, what kinds of structures were here?  All right. The original structures   and we   ll go up to the old home sites  up above here   but originally, they were in a dugout over here around  by the mountain, living in the ground. They actually had a dugout and  tarpaulins and stuff like that and wagons and lived kind of in a hole to  start with. Where the old house is now, they actually started building a  barn there, and history kind of repeated itself. Mrs. Ray thought living in  the barn was a little bit better than living in the ground, and so she  moved into Granddad   s barn, and he had to build her a house then.  (Laughs) So, that   s kind of how that came about. Again, my mother     Dad had carpenters here building a new barn, which has burned since,  and did build a real nice barn, and I can remember. I was a small boy,  but she was arguing with Dad. She wanted her kitchen redone and  wanted this and that, and he didn   t really have the finance or feel like he  needed to deal with the kitchen. It suited him the way it was.  He left out real early one morning on his old horse going  to check on  the cattle . Of course, the cattle ran on all over the bottoms and  everywhere. They got the new barn built, and she moved all of us down  in the barn. (Laughs) Of course, all of us boys loved it because we   d  swing around on the rafters and whatnot. It was a nice barn, and she told  him,    You get those carpenters up there and fix my kitchen.    So we  came from living in the ground to living in a home with construction.  Then my wife and I actually went back in the ground. We built an  underground home in our life. So we lived in our caves. (Laughter)  6  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Well, your grandparents, did they have siblings?  Yes. I   ll have to trace the trees, though.  That   s okay. How did the land pass down to you?  How it came down, either the wise-ness of it or the unwise-ness of it.  There were four of us children, two girls and two boys. And in the  course of all of this, having to do with the Depression and the  foreclosures and judgments and everything else that happens in all these  things, the boys were made heirs to the land, and then we settled up with  our sisters. So it was transferred from our folks to us. That   s the way it  was.  And how had they gotten it from their folks?  Well, now, Dad got his own allotment. He got it from the state, or from  the government, see? He had his own allotment, and then he bought his  mother   s allotment.  On the original home place, how many lakes or ponds or streams were  there? What   s your water situation?  Oh, we   ve constructed several range farm ponds and whatnot. There are,  oh, seven, eight or so, nice ponds on the place. One of them, you all  came by coming in here. There   s some history to that old thing. It was  actually an old spring down there. Oh, these were old dirt roads then,  and people would get stuck there. My dad has pulled many a person out  of there, including Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, with the saddle  horn of his horse. My people took teams and slips and just dug it out.  Down through the years we   ve just dug it out.  The water holes were very important when people were traveling  through the country way back there. They   d travel from water hole to  water hole, and the old stage line that came through going down to Fort  Bog Depot, they   d water here and whatnot. And also, people would soak  their wagons and ox carts. The wheels will dry out, and they have to  soak them to keep the spokes in them and everything. So, they would  camp here in this old mud hole or spring or water hole. I   ve found here,  in later years, I   ll be digging it out and cleaning it out and still find  pieces of ock yokes and things where people had been camped here. So  this water hole has been here  a long time.  And every old-timer that I  could ever talk to, including my dad or anybody else, there was always  water right here at that spot. So it has been a camp site way back   and  that   s probably how our people originally settled on this spot out here as  the Smallwoods, was because of the water. I don   t have documentation  7  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  of that, but water holes were very important.  What were some of the early crops?  Oh, corn, oats, mostly some type of feed for your livestock. Later years,  cotton came in as a cash crop, and some peanuts. During World War II,  there was a demand for things and the farmers, the old ranchers, did a lot  of changing during the war in terms of their crops. In fact, I know Dad  had a cotton field and, of course, all the men had gone off to the war and  whatnot, and they took the school busses and brought kids out from  town to gather the crops. So, no telling how little money my folks  actually had, but they had the cotton all piled up at the end of the fields,  and a couple of these city girls decided they   d smoke a cigarette. Where  they   d decided to smoke the cigarette was sitting in the cotton pile and  threw their match down and burned Dad   s cotton up. (Laughs) So he  wasn   t too happy with city kids. But they brought the kids out from town  to help gather the crops during the war.  And by town, you mean Atoka?  Atoka, yes. That was a big town to us. If we went, we went in the  wagon. It was an all-day affair to get to town and get back.  Which is about five or six miles from here?  It was seven miles then. Dad measured from the courthouse. All the old-timers,  everything started at the courthouse. And, of course, town has  grown now, and it has come on out. Dad would still say he lived seven  miles from town. It didn   t matter what the city limits said.  How often would you go to town, then?  Well, we used to say   and I don   t know how accurate this really is   we  used to say,    Mother went to town every fall whether she needed to or  not.    (Laughs) In fact, we   d go to town   there   s a   y   all crossed it,  Sandy Creek over there, just right out from Atoka. You   ll cross it. We  could play along behind the wagon and cut up and all that, but when we  got to that creek, that   s where we stopped. Mother scrubbed us all down  there, and if you ever had a good sand scrubbing, well, you know what.  We   d get cleaned up, and we   d have to chew some willow bark and try  to clean our teeth up and all that. Then we had to get in the wagon and  sit there, and we   d go into town. You went up a complete different way  than when you go in now. Of course, town kids would run alongside and  make cat calls at you, and the dogs would bark, because you were  considered country. Country was country back when there was a  difference.  8  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Now, we have running water and everything else, but I saw a program,  this Little House on the Prairie, and they were going to town. It was  kind of the same thing, how they had to sit up there in the wagon, and  the kids made cat calls at them. I thought,    I   ve been there.    (Laughs)  But we   d go to town and go down to the livery stable, wagon yards, and  they   d unload us there and hook the team up and all of that. Mom and  Dad would have some eggs and cream and stuff to sell, and they   d give  us   I think the most I can ever remember getting was a quarter, but  there was a new ice plant up north of town, and we   d head straight to the  ice plant. I can remember Mr. Waddell running it. Later on, I got to  know who the man was. I didn   t know then. But they   d cut these ice  blocks, and there   d be shavings off of it. Man, that was like candy to us.  I mean, that was just   he   d let us have that, and so we   d all go to the ice  plant, first thing.  Then we   d go to the show, and I think the show was a dime, popcorn  was a nickel, coke was a nickel, and we   d come out of the show, and  we   d have a nickel that we could spend any way we wanted to. Of  course, we   d head to the ice cream parlors, and I don   t even think we   ve  got an ice cream parlor in Atoka anymore, but that was the gang-up  place. By the mid-afternoon, well, our folks would be ready to head back  home. Usually, we   d start out early in daylight. We   d get back at dark.  That was the way it was.  Do you remember the name of the movie house?  Pick   s Theater. Then later on, we got a fancy one across the street called  Thompson. Now, I think it cost you fifteen cents. We didn   t go over  there to that one very much.  And what were some of the things your mother would buy to bring back?  They   d buy flour and stuff, and they   d buy it in certain print because  Mother could sew. Oh, she could sew  And they   d buy everything in a  certain print at the stores because she   d go make dresses or shirts or  whatever else out of it. They would buy salt and sugar and stuff like that  and some flour and a few things. Most everything was grown on the  home.  She had a big garden?  Oh, yes. Momma could   and Mother knew every herb, every berry. She  gathered everything, and we had a smokehouse and all that kind of stuff.  A cellar?  9  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Had a cellar. Everything was   there is a word, and my wife used it here  a year or two ago, and I got kind of tickled   store-bought. In my time, if  you had something that was store-bought, Valentines or anything like  that, you made them at school. If somebody, sometime, a teacher, would  give you a little Valentine, it would be store-bought. But your candies or  anything was always homemade. You didn   t have anything that was  store-bought, and if you got something store-bought, you were  considered pretty important.  Would your mother make pants, too, or just mostly shirts?  No, mostly shirts. Mostly shirts and stuff like that and dresses for the  girls. No, you   d get overalls and pants and stuff like that. It was hand-me-  downs. They came down. You didn   t get something new, and there  were always uncles and aunts and nephews and nieces. Everybody  passed stuff around. Mother had a    Badge of Courage,    I called it, or  something, and it was   she wore a pin up here in her blouse   needle  and thread. I said a pin, it was a needle and thread   and I guarantee you,  you come running in, if it was a button kind of torn loose or something,  you had to stand there until she stitched it back. There was no   every  stitch in time was her way, and they saved buttons. They   d save thread,  even. They saved everything. A box, they   d get fruit or anything like  that, it   d come in a box. Anything that came in a box, they   d save the  whole box or take it apart. I   ve seen my dad straightening nails. They  were conservative people. Ball of twine, they   d wrap it up. They used  everything.  Having lived through the Depression, they did that?  No, it was just the way. The Depression had a lot to do with it too, I   m  for sure. It was hard times, but you just didn   t have a store. You didn   t  run to town. You made do. Peddlers would come out through the  country in buggies, and they would sell shoe polish and shoelaces and  stuff like that, and maybe Momma would give them a chicken. Trade  them a chicken. You didn   t have a lot of money, but you traded goods.  There wasn   t a lot of cash around and when the banks collapsed, the  men, all they had was what was in their pockets and that was it. Dad  would hunt. Dad was known as a good hunter, but I didn   t know, he  wasn   t hunting sport. He was hunting for food and hides. Our  smokehouse would have mink and coon hides and stuff like that on it,  and he would sell them and whatnot. He   d ranch all day and hunt half  the night, but they were trying to make it. Never held a public job. They  didn   t know what it was.  So the farm sustained the family?  10  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Right. And Dad would go, he   d take his wagon   all the men did this,  too. I mean, it was not just him. He   d go somewhere, a thrashing crew or  something like that, he   d work all day, and he   d come home that night.  He   d have a load of oats, or something like that, in his wagon. That   s  how he got paid for working that day   or go to the hay fields, the same  way. He   d bring a load of  whatever  and that was kind of  the way it  was . And Dad was known as kind of a country vet. He was pretty good.  Dad was good. He was a good horseman, good vet, dogs and stuff that  way. He would go camp and work people   s cattle for them and stuff like  that. Men would kill a beef, and you   d get part of the beef and stuff like  that. There wasn   t much money.  Did your mother work off the farm any?  No, but the ladies, they quilted and sewed. The men, they   d have barn  raisings and house raisings and stuff like that. Well, we went to one and  something was wrong with the house, the ceiling. They didn   t have a  quilting frame hanging there. All houses had quilting frames hanging in  them. And the women, when they   d get together, they didn   t just sit  around and gossip. They   d quilt and stuff like that. When we were little  kids, we   d go to a neighbor   s house. Well, while the ladies were visiting  and whatnot, they   d be quilting or sewing, stuff like that.  Do you have any of your mother   s left?  We have some of her old quilts, yes. Momma was good. She was a good  animal husbandry, she knew livestock, she knew turkeys and chickens  and stuff. She was good. She read. My mother read, and they had a  program. My mother thought it was gospel, but home demonstration  ladies would come out from town and have classes. I mean, my mother  would go to those and she   d come home and we   d have to   in fact, she  cut out and made a tie, and she taught us boys how to tie four-hand  bowlines and knots. I went in the army, and I tied many of guys    ties for  them. And we didn   t even own a tie, but Mother was that gifted and  forward thinking in her thoughts. Her suits and things would win at the  fairs, state and everything. She was good. Momma was good.  She belonged to a homemaker club then?  Yes, yes she did.  Do you remember the name of it?  I think it was the Wards Chapel. Yes, I think that   s still the Wards  Chapel Community, here. Everything was out in a local area. Your local  11  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  school and your local government and everything was right here.  So when you were in elementary school, where did you go?  Right down here at Wards Chapel, about   oh, about a mile and a half,  two miles down here.  And how would you get there?  Horseback. There was no kid ever hot rodded a car anywhere, so I hot  rodded a horse. (Laughter)  And about how many students were in that school   or in your grade?  In my grade? One.  Just you, huh?  No, excuse me, two. There were two. Excuse me. There were two  students. One I had there was a girl in my grade with me. There were  two of us in my grade.  And one through eight?  One through eight, yes.  So maybe twenty or less?  Oh, there were six, eight. There were six, eight, ten kids, something like  that. They   d move in and out.  And what would you take for lunch?  Momma would fix us a lunch. Oh, I don   t know. It would be some kind  of a biscuit and sausage and stuff like that and some things, chicken.  She   d grab an old chicken and have him in a pot or wring his neck and  have him on the table. I used to say we had chickens running all around,  and they   d just be everywhere in the yard and everything. But the gleam  in Mother   s eye. When she walked out the back door with that gleam  you could see those chickens head out. That old rooster knew that he   d  better get gone or he was going in the pot. (Laughter) But she   d fix us  egg salad sandwiches, stuff like that. We didn   t have much store-bought  stuff. Not peanut butter, we got that in later years. But cow   s butter and  jelly and stuff like that. We had jellies, all kinds of jellies and canned  stuff. But you carried your lunch. And the very last of my rural  schooling, they got to where they got commodities in the school, and the  12  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  teacher would put a big pot of beans on the old   we had old pot-bellied  stoves that we warmed around. So we got where we   d have some hot  lunches.  Well, and after the eighth grade, where   ?  I went to Atoka to high school. Atoka.  And graduated in   ?  1950.  1950. And then?  I went off to the army, Korean War. We were all in the National Guard,  the 45th, the old Thunderbird outfit. We got federalized and ended up in  Korea. We went down to Camp Polk and trained and then went to  Hokkaido, Japan, and then into Korea. I got home in 1952 and went to  Stillwater, which was A M then, and went to college. I studied animal  husbandry.  On the G.I. Bill?  On the G.I. Bill, yes. I was one of the first returning veterans to get     well, amongst the first   to get the G.I. Bill. In fact, they didn   t have it  when we got there. We knew we were going to get it, but we got back-pay.  They didn   t have it in affect. They were having trouble paying us,  and they still haven   t been able to decide. They never called it a war, and  when they wrote the bill at World War II, it was during war time, and  they couldn   t come along and figure out how to pay us because we  weren   t  in a war . We were considered a police action. Let   s see. What  else was it? Military conflict and not on a   they still couldn   t figure out  that we were in war. But they finally got us paid.  And once you got to Stillwater, where did you live?  Oh, man, I lived several different places. (Laughs) I rented me a place  kind of out in the country. I had my horses and dogs with me and then  later, I got married   what, my junior year or senior year we got  married? We lived at Guthrie when I first got married, and she worked at  the welfare department in Guthrie, and I commuted back and forth to  Stillwater. That was the next semester, we moved into Stillwater. She  got transferred and we lived at 711 S. Duck. I can remember that.  (Laughter) We were up there, oh, a few years later and went down to  711 S. Duck.  13  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Nykolaiszyn  Ray  Finchum  Well, was the G.I. Bill enough to pay your expenses, or did you have to  work some?  Oh, yes. Well, I worked at the Payne County creamery and places like  that. And then, of course, I always worked when I was up there. I   d  work out on ranches and whatnot. I had my horses and dogs with me,  and I always worked.  Well, what were you doing with your horses? Did you just have them to  ride for fun?  I rodeoed some and this and that.  Were you in 4-H when you were in high school?  Not in high school. I was in FFA in high school. I was in 4-H when I  was out in the country. We had 4-H.  Went to county fairs?  Yes.  Not just your mother competing, but did you have some things?  Yes. I don   t think I was ever very competitive. I think I tried, but I didn   t  ever do too good.  When you were in school, what was going on here on the farm?  Oh, my dad was still  farming . Of course, Mother   s health had failed by  then and things were getting pretty tough here on the old ranch, but I   d  still come home. In fact, I went to Stillwater the first year then I dropped  back out and went to Murray the next year, then I could help my dad. I   d  come home on weekends. It was just quite a ways from Stillwater to try  to get back. I set some speed records, though, getting back and forth. I  could do that. (Laughter) But I   d come home and help my dad on  weekends. About the period of time I came home, we started a terrible  drought. It started in like 1952 and that   s when I returned, and it  continued plumb on up,    52-3-4-5 and    56, it was terrible. In fact, my  dad just like to went busted again and everything else. They built Lake  Texoma back in the late    40s, and they claimed it would never run  over  the spillway  in a hundred years. The spring of    57, I guess it was,    56 or     57, the thing ran  over the spillway  after that terrible drought. It was  about the worst drought we   ve seen around here.  What crops or products did your dad have at that time?  14  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  He wasn   t growing much, just still some maize and corn, grain, stuff like  that. He wasn   t growing cotton and peanuts then. Mostly it was feed for  his livestock that he would grow. That was kind of a neat thing.  (Laughs) Mother came from probably one of the greatest farming  families there was around here. Her dad was a tremendous farmer.  Moved in here out of Texas and that was really a farming family, and  my dad thought it could be done on horseback. He felt like a plow was a  devil   s tool. Dad just farmed enough to keep Momma happy. That   s the  way it was. That   s the way the farming went. (Laughter)  And what was your dad   s name?  Ralph.  Ralph. And your mother?  Edna.  And her maiden name was?  Was Hankins.  Well, let   s back up a little bit and talk about the original farmhouse that  you grew up in. Can you describe that?  Oh, it was a big old place, to me. It has been chopped up and redone and  this and that. I think there are some parts of it still there, but we had a  big fireplace. That was the main, central gathering place and everything  else was the fireplace. Of course, that was about all the heat that you had  back then. A cook stove and a fireplace was all there was in a house, and  we always ganged around the old fireplace. Of course, you thought it  was great, but really, it   d roast you on one side and freeze on the other.  That   s the way the old fireplaces were back then, but we all ganged  around it and popped corn and stuff like that, all the usual things. I don   t  know. They used to make taffy candy and all that kind of stuff, and then  Momma was liable to have a pot of beef or something hanging over the  fireplace and stew or something that way. I grew up with a fireplace.  And where was your bedroom?  Well, mine was kind of in a back part of the house. Mom and Dad slept  out on a porch, a screened in porch. I   ve seen snow on their beds, but  that   s where they would sleep. (Laughs) We were kind of in the back  part of the house and my gosh, I don   t know how many of us was in one  bed at a time. It was kind of a community operation. (Laughs) And you  15  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  always had cousins and everything else. You grew up in family. There  weren   t any   you didn   t have a single bed. You grew up with somebody  else in your bed, two or three of them with you. That   s just the way it  was.  And was the floor wood or linoleum?  No, we had wooden floors. We had a wooden floor. Now, our yard, I can  remember, we didn   t have a grass yard or anything. Mother had a big old  mallet, fixed-type thing, and she packed that yard just like it was   it was  ground, it was dirt, because you didn   t have lawn mowers and stuff like  that, and she had a rock garden and flowers and stuff, fixed it around,  but she   d sweep that yard. It was a swept yard just like a packed    we  didn   t have grass like they do today. No lawns.  Indoor plumbing?  Oh, no. (Laughs)  When did it come?  Oh, I don   t know. Now, I can go kind of back to my dad a little bit. We  always had outhouses. That was the deal. We finally got the plumbing.  He kept the outhouse. He didn   t go for the indoor plumbing too much.  (Laughter) Sears and Roebuck catalogue and stuff like that.  A one-seater or a two?  We had a two-seater. We were kind of uptown. (Laughs)  And were any of them a WPA  Works Progress Administration ? Some  people had WPA toilets.  I don   t think so. We had some WPA out here, but they were basically  building roads and bridges and things like that. I don   t remember  anything WPA in our household deal. Now, the state did come after the  Depression when the things were being helped. They came in and  helped. They brought prisoners, war prisoners, out. They had a Prison of  War camp out here, and they brought them out, and they worked around  on the farm, some.  When did rural electric come in?  I believe it was    47 when electricity finally came. But now, we were  ahead of the times. In fact, some of the kids, we   ll get together now, the  old kids   we were up on the hill up here and you could make it this far.  16  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  (Gestures) And the roads were terrible, but Dad always kept an old horse  saddled and in the lots, or a saddle and horse. There was always an extra  horse in the lots. People could make it this far. And even, they got an old  bus line or you could catch a ride, but they lived off, back over there,  and they could take this horse and saddle, and they   d saddle him and go.  They   d ride him home and just turn him loose, and he   d come back. Dad  always kept spare horses in the lots because people needed them. We  also, later on in visiting with other kids, kids thought   because you  could get to our home, we were considered to have it better because  creeks would get out and they couldn   t cross them. They had to wait for  their creeks to go down and that type deal, but we got ahead of things.  Mother was always ordering, and she   d order books and study them. She  ordered us a wind charger. Dad got three big tall, straight posts and we  put up a wind charger and had batteries and they charged batteries, and  we had one light bulb and whatnot. This was before rural electric. We  had electricity, and everybody thought we were uptown, which, you  barely could see with the thing but   and charge those batteries and we   d  save them. You could listen to the news a little bit. Then on Saturday  night we listened to Fibber McGee and Molly and the Grand Ole Opry  and Lum and Abner. That   s what it was, Lum and Abner. We   d listen to  a couple of programs on Saturday night, and neighbors would come and  listen to the radio. Then the REA  Rural Electric Administration  came  in in    47, and we got electricity. Then the indoor plumbing, it followed  pretty soon after that. I   m not for sure. But the old place up there has got  a big cistern. Basically, the back porch covers the big cistern, and you  caught rain water that ran off of the house, and it went into the cistern.  And you also caught barrels of water. Water was a big item out in a rural  area.  And bath time at that point?  Well, bath time, I always say,    My mother   s getting to bathe in fresh  water.    I was the baby and she started with me. She   d have a bathtub  and heat the water and pour water in it, and then she   d scrub me down.     Now, Momma scrubbed you down. Now, I   m going to tell you       from  one end to the other, eyes, ears, but she   d bathe all the kids. Then  Momma bathed in what was left. I always say that she   s getting fresh  water today. That was the way we bathed in the washtub. I guess you   d  call it   yes, washtub. Not bathtub, washtub.  A number   ?  Number two washtub.  Number two. (Laughs) Winter, spring, summer, any time?  17  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Now, in the summers and whatnot, we   d get out on the  porch and outside and bathe. But now, in winter time, you got in the  kitchen and bathed. Then, of course, you always swam in the farm ponds  and creeks and rivers, and all that.  Did you have assigned chores?  Oh, yes. Mine, basically, was gathering kindling and firewood. Fires had  to be started every morning. So, I had a little red wagon, and I   d have to  go gather kindling and stuff that way. In fact, I got in all kinds of  trouble. They had started building this road through here, the highway  department had, and the surveyors came along and did all this surveying.  You know those stakes that they drive in? Boy, they make good  firewood  I gathered up all the surveyors    stakes and had kindling.  (Laughter) That didn   t go over well. They were kind of upset about that.  Then, of course, you had to go bring your milk cows in and stuff like  that, gather eggs. Now, the big chores as a kid growing up, Mother  raised a lot of turkeys. She   d fix me a sandwich, and I   d get my old  horse and whatnot, but I   d have to follow the turkeys all day long  because of the coyotes and wolves and everything. So, I   d have to herd  turkeys like herding sheep, and I hate a turkey. And then bring them  back in at night time. They   d put them in a pen at night time, closure. I  grew up herding turkeys. So all the kids had jobs.  Was there much difference between brothers and sisters? Did the chores  vary based on your gender?  I guess so. I don   t know. My oldest sister, she was quite a cow hand,  now. They worked in and out. They worked outside and inside, too, and  all of us did. Mom, Dad, one of us had to at least stay, like, dinner time,  those that had to go to the field, but one had to stay and help Mother do  the dishes and things that way. You rotated the chores-type thing, but  my oldest sister, she was quite a bronc rider. She   d chase cattle just like  a man. I   ve heard the other men talking about it, say,    June can ride  through, the best brusch gal I   ve ever seen  She   d jump a yearling. She  didn   t lose him.    But we all worked, worked in the hay fields and  everything.  And what would you do for fun on the farm?  Oh, my gracious sakes alive  We did some things I   ve often wondered  about. Now, we did them, all kids did them, and you   d think,    Well,  what was fun about it?    One of them was we rolled a hoop, and kids  would roll a hoop. I don   t know. We   d take a Prince Albert can, which  18  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  was a big item   you could make so many things out of a Prince Albert  can it   s unbelievable  But we   d take a stick and fold that Prince Albert  can, and off of a wagon, the spoke deal had a steel part that went around  it, and you could get those and roll them. You   d roll them and roll them  and roll them. If we could get an old tire, we   d do like that, and of  course, in wintertime, we   d skate on the farm ponds. I can   t use the  words like we would, but what are you supposed to use now? But we all  had   what do you call them, bean flips, now? African shooters.  (Laughs) I   m trying to be politically correct, but everybody had rubber  guns and stuff that way.  Like a slingshot of sorts?  Slingshot. Well, a slingshot   s a different deal, but these were   what do  you call them. Bean flips? I don   t know.  We had slingshots that had the V and you pulled them back and     No, a slingshot   s something you swing around and around, I think. I  don   t know, but we had them. But everybody carried one of those, and  everybody had a pocket knife, too. Kids can   t even go to school  with  one now , and you had mumblepeg  game played with pocketknives   and tops and stuff. I   ll tell you something else, and I   ve often thought of  how great a game it was and you don   t even see it today, but balance and  coordination. If you could find   especially the girls did this, but boys  would play it, too. But if you could find a good smooth piece of ground,  hop scotch. You don   t see it. You think about what it takes to play hop  scotch and how much balance and coordination, and all kids played. We  played Red Rover and Annie Over and all those games. Throw a ball  over a house. Annie Over and stuff like that. Of course, then, we also  had ballgames. Most of us didn   t have any gloves or anything like that,  lucky we had a ball, a ball and a bat. We swam and played and rode  horses and climbed trees and everything.  Catch fireflies?  Oh, yes, catch fireflies. Shoot, yes. Kids still do that, I guess.  Did you have to kill a chicken yourself?  Oh, yes. You   d go wring a chicken. My momma usually took care of  that.  Did she have a particular method?  Well, she could grab that thing and wring that neck, and I don   t know   19  Back then everybody stayed with you, too. You   d have some worthless  uncle or something like that that was living with you. Of course, us kids  loved it, but we had an Uncle Peck. He was kind of a derelict, I think,  but we thought he was great because he was always around to tell stories  and play with, but he didn   t work. We lived up there, and they called this  the Lane Hole, then. There was a story about this old pond being called  the Lane Hole. But he   d fish and, in fact, he   d take the bells off of     Momma would put a bell on her turkeys where she could hear them or  whatnot, and he   d even swipe the bells off her turkeys and hang them on  his trout line, so he could sleep while he was  fishing . Why, that   s how  energetic Uncle Peck was. But he was quite a philosopher.  Back then, people traveled in wagons and stuff and went to town and  stuff, but if storms came up, they were trapped, and they just came in  your house. That   s just the way it was. You   d end up with a house full of  people. So this particular day, Momma didn   t have a lot cooked up, but  Uncle Peck had been down here to the pond. He killed a little old teal  duck. You know what a teal duck is? He   s not much of a duck. And  Mother would   she   d tell this. This is quite a deal. So she made up a lot  of dressing and put this duck in it to make a meal for everybody that  day. It was raining and storming. We all gathered around the table.  Uncle Peck said he wanted to turn the blessing, and I seen my mother  hunker down, then, because she knew something was wrong if Uncle  Peck was going to do the blessing, but you couldn   t do nothing but let it.  He said,    Dear Lord, what a blessing. We have meat at our house, a little  bitty duck and a ton of dressing.    (Laughter) So everybody had a good  time. Everybody visited. We have, I don   t know how many, vehicles  sitting around here, and we don   t have time to visit anybody.  Dad thought it was just a right that he had to go and dig your grave. That  was always a thing. Early morning, he   d tell Momma,    get his  breakfast    and this or that, whatever it is, and he   d grab his shovel. He   d  go to other communities. It was kind of interesting because later on I got  to go some with him. Sometime a team would run away and kill  somebody or something like that. Sometimes a gunfight or something  would happen. But the old-timers  would do that . When my dad died, I  have no idea how many graves he dug. We hired his grave dug. I  thought it would have been something  to have community members do  it . You   d go to a dig and it would be a truce time. There   d be some  people, there   d be bad blood between families, but while they were there  digging the grave, these same guys that you know were almost carrying  guns for each other, there was a truce. One of them would get down in  there and work. There wouldn   t be room for all the men to work at once,  then some would work a while and then somebody else would. But, of  course, I didn   t realize they didn   t embalm people back then. They had  to get them in the ground, and they   d make the caskets, and they   d do  20  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  stuff like that. There was a carpenter in the bunch that was a casket  maker, and they   d get people buried. But Dad always  helped , or if  there was a widow woman, he had to go plow her field. That was a  necessity he would do.  Neighbors help neighbors.  Neighbors help neighbors. And if there was kind of a thug in the  community, then my dad and two or three others would kindly take care  of that, too. There were some stories about somebody abusing his wife  or something that way. That didn   t go on. If you beat somebody up, you  were going to get some retaliation. Communities took care of things.  Not so much today.  Well, but that was my dad. My brother and I started taking over on the  old ranches. It was kind of funny in later years. We started putting locks  on the gates. It made my dad so mad. He said,    Who are you going to  keep out?  Ben Thomas?    He said,    That lock won   t keep nobody out  but an honest person     He   d grown up during open range. If somebody  would have a little spot fenced off for something, if they were looking  for a horse or missing a mule or something like, or if they wanted to go  hunting or fishing, they had a right to come and go. I never heard him  complain about having anything stolen. I can   t park a tractor out in a  field and go back and find the batteries on it. We bought another ranch,  Perry and I did, and took Dad to show it to him, and Dad was riding up  front. I got tickled. Perry handed him the key and told him,    Dad, get  out.    He said,    Boy, you put that lock on there. You unlock it.    (Laughs)  But a handshake, Dad didn   t sign a contract. He shook hands with you.  That was the way he did business. That was a different time.  When did you take over the farm?  Oh, actually when I came out of college, I started more or less helping  Dad. So that would have been in    56. I knew I was coming back. We  came back here and just right soon after that, I pretty well took over. He  just moved aside and let us more or less have it.  Did you have to do a job to supplement that?  Oh, yes. Yes, I   ve held all kinds of jobs. (Laughs) My wife did, too. We  always worked. It   s hard to just grub it, especially starting right out of  the range because if you take away from the range too much, it can   t  stand it. So we worked off the farm. And we were just getting started,  too. We didn   t have anything. I had a sale this past year, and I was just  in amazement of what we had accumulated in terms of equipment and  21  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  stuff, and things that you accumulate. But when we started, we didn   t  even have a stock trailer.  Over fifty years, I guess, in the business.  Oh, yes.  And what did you do most of that time? Cattle, or      Yes, we started out just like anybody else, kind of in the commercial  business, but right soon we bought another place. We started improving  our places and improving our pastures and dozing and planting grasses.  So we were getting our places improved and started kind of looking at  our cattle, and I   ll call them just Okie cattle. So we started trying to  improve the quality of our cattle. That evolved, and then we got to  looking at our market, and regardless of how we improved our place and  improved our cattle, we still just had our local markets. We were kind of  at the mercy of them. And when you go to a local market, you pretty  well take whatever you get. There are about two things you can hope for  or look forward to. You hope the market   s hot when you get there and  you get a good weighing, because that   s it. You take whatever.  So we started looking around and started trying to change our  merchandizing program. We got into the seedstock business, and we  started raising Brangus. Well, we tried two or three other breeds to start  with, and we finally settled on Brangus cattle. And so we got into the  seedstock business and started merchandising off our own program. We  still had the sale barns and the stockyards and everything for anything  that we wanted to cull or get rid of, but we pretty well merchandised off  the ranch. And we got involved with the test stations. In fact, just about  as soon as they started developing test stations, we got in them and  started to gain testing cattle. We were very fortunate. In our program, we  were able to set several gain records with our herd of cattle and still hold  the records at OBI at Stillwater with the Brangus.  And by gain testing you mean   ?  Average daily gain. It   s just a way of measuring livestock. You have all  ways from visual appraisal, which is in the show ring, and all these other  things. Gain testing was you take an animal, and you weigh it and feed it  and weigh it every so often, see how its conversion is and how it   s  gaining and what it   s doing. It   s just like anything. I eat a pretty good  meal, but I   m not a good gainer. My wife   s asleep, now, but she can  watch a commercial on TV and gain weight. It   s genetics, and we started  selecting cattle for better gain, along with confirmation and marbling  and all the other qualities that you look for in an animal.  22  Nykolaiszyn  Ray  So we dealt with the first gain test station which was actually at Murray,  and then Noble Foundation at Ardmore. We started there with the Noble  Foundation, and we did continue with the Noble in a lot of ways,  pastures and everything else. Then later, we developed stations at  Stillwater, OBI at Stillwater, and I   m one of the founders in that, in the  Brangus end of it, and I served on the OBI board for years. I got off of it  just a few years ago just from the standpoint of running back and forth  and taking care of my wife, but I don   t want to go to boasting or  anything like that. I hate somebody that sticks their chest out, but we  were fortunate enough to get our cattle to work, and our gain program is  what really established our sales and our market because old farmers and  ranchers, they pay attention to that stuff. If you   ve got an animal that  would gain, genetically he   ll pass that along, and it   s a very efficient  way of rating animals.  For example, we started out at the Noble Foundation hunting a four  pound gaining animal. At that time, we had cattle gaining   in fact, the  Brangus we fed, the first one gained 2.99. It didn   t even get to three  pounds, but it was winning with three and a quarter, three and a half  pound gain per day and stuff like that. Down through the years   in fact,  I   ve got a chart in there showing it   but anyhow, we hold the record at  Stillwater now with 6.19. And if you   re in a gain station now   we   re  going back to this   like Jim Ryan, the four-minute mile, we were all  hunting this four pound gain. All breeds, Hereford, Angus, everybody  was doing this, and you just didn   t think you were ever going to get  there. Now, if you   re in a station and don   t have an animal at least gain  four pounds, they   ll laugh at you. But that   s what we   ve done with  genetics. It   s the same way with the breast on chickens and all these  things with genetics that we   ve been able to improve.  What steps were you taking to improve the gain with the cattle?  Well, just kind of breed the fastest with the fastest. That   s just about the  simplest way to do it. If we could find an animal that could fit all the  other criteria, it   s not just that. You had to pay attention to temperament  and all the different things. You can   t just go for one. One trait selection  will get you in trouble right quick. You   ve got to keep milk. You   ve got  to keep all the things that you   ve got to get. Now, as you select  sometime toward one trait, you   ll lose something on the other side. So  you   ve got to try to balance. It   s very slow. Gain is very slow, and you  can improve frame score, you can improve milk, you can do a lot of  other things a lot quicker than you can do gain. But gain and conversion  go together, and a lot of people will want to disagree with you on that,  but they do. An animal that gains good, converts good.  23  Finchum  Ray  Now, conversion is very important because of the amount of feed it  takes to put a pound of gain on something is really there. You can get a  lot of arguments on this discussion, but it   s kind of like an old tractor or  vehicle. They   ll say,    How much gas is it burning?    Well, if it   s not how  much gas it burns, it   s,    How good of a load is it pulling?    And so that   s  the way that gain works out. And of course, gain, an animal will have a  lot of different things and frame is not gain, although you can get a big  animal. But it   s red meat that weighs, and that   s what we want to put on  the table. It   s not what we haul out, and so we   ve changed frame scores  some. We   ve done a lot of different things. But this is over a period of  years. It didn   t happen overnight. In fact, it seemed like we   d go along  four, five, six, seven years before we   d get a bull. Genetically, you have  a good animal, but can he out-breed itself? In other words, does he have  the ability to pass those genetics on? And then you   ve got to mate it with  the right cow. These things   and selection is sometimes 90 percent luck,  and I don   t know what the other part is. (Laughter)  But we go back and we have pretty well run a line program quite a bit.  We   re pretty strong in our breeding program, and there   s an ongoing   discussion  about line breeding and inbreeding. There are two different  things. Well, inbreeding   s when it doesn   t work. Line breeding is when  it works. So you   ve got to be very careful, and you   ve got to have a  strong animal. If you can get a bull that can out breed   I was fortunate  enough to follow some gentlemen along that I give credit for   Carlton  Corbin was, C. W. Corbin, was one of the great breeders of the time in  Angus. He was one of my monitors and some other men, and he would  make a statement. Mr. Corbin, I can rattle all day and can   t say anything,  and he could say more with one word or two words than I could. But  he   d say,    A good bull is out of date in a year.    And that, you   ve got to  really think about that, and it   s hard to swallow. But he was saying if he  was a good animal, he would produce a son better than him, is what he  was saying. You really don   t get it. We never got it nailed down that  good. But genetically, if you have a superior animal, he   ll be out of date  in a year because he   ll have a son coming along that  is better . So that  was the way he set his program of trying to improve, and I tried to  follow his thoughts. Now, it doesn   t work that way, but in reality if you  could do it, you   d make fast movement. But animal selection, it   s hard.  Well, how would you keep records from those early days when you were  doing all this? There weren   t computers in the    70s.  Oh, boy  Back of your hand, shirt pocket. (Laughs) Well, you had books  that you kept, and you tried to keep your records, and you identified  your animals. You do a lot of different systems. Later on we got  software. We   d use different things. I had an old man that called it roots.  I   d have numbers written on my cattle, branded on them and whatnot,  24  Finchum  Ray  and I was selling bulls to an old man in Colorado. He   d always give me  a hard time. He   d want me to explain them roots that I had written on  my cattle. (Laughs) But you have to identify them. You have to keep  records, and it   s a time consuming thing. And man, it   s unbelievable  what they   re doing today in DNA and genetic testing and things like  that. They   ve run over me, even, today.  They came along and started wanting signed contracts and forfeit your  money and stuff like that. Dad didn   t really want to do business with  you. I came along kind of the same, but my kid   s trying to drag me into  the computer age, and I still wanted to use my darned old Chief tablet  book. I   d go in and serve on these boards, and these guys come in with  their laptops. I was behind the times, and I thought about my dad. I  thought,    Well, here I am getting run over because I didn   t go into the  computer age fast enough.    I finally got me a cattle program in on my  computer and finally learned how to turn one on and off, but I never did  get good. But the records today are unbelievable. Even myself, I can   t  understand all of what they   re doing today. Let me get you something.  I   ll show you something. Let me get my eyeglasses on and show you.  This was 1979 (gesturing to a chart). We produced the first four-pound  bull at Stillwater. It was the first four-pound bull in the breed. And then  1980, we came back and set a new record with old Hulk. This was  Pacesetter, this bull right here was (gesturing to a chart). This was 201.  This is Pacesetter. (Gestures)  Then in    85, Hulk came along and set the record at 4.89. I use this  triangle just to bring out   this is what we used in our ads. I had a  colored one back there. I wished I had it. Then Lonesome was the first  five-pound bull in the breed. He set the record at 5.41. And then  Tradition, which these are just plays off of names, but it   s been a family  tradition. We use this in all of our advertisements, family tradition of  gain. We had a bull that set the six-pound record. We   ve done work way  back before this, but look how long it took. Then he came back and  produced a son, Hercules, in 2000, which is the record right here now,  6.19. Noble Foundation had a cutoff of three pounds on their sale. To get  in the sale, you had to have a bull gain three pounds, and the Brangus  was developed as a new breed. We   re actually considered, in terms of  other breeds like Hereford and Angus, we were young kids on the block.  We finally got a calf to gain 2.99, and they wavered and let us put him in  the sale, see. And we   ve gone from that to this, but that   s years and years  and years of work.  Twenty years, at least.  This is just at Stillwater. We would do work before this. This ad is just at  Stillwater. We were working before Stillwater ever had a station. But  25  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  I   m not saying it   s real simple. Well, that   s pretty good, isn   t it? That   s  what that gain situation is, and we started out like a lot of people chasing  the show ring, but I   m not fighting the show ring. But we left the show  ring and went into this end of it, and it sold a lot of cattle for us.  Well, in any given year, how many cattle would you have?  Well, a seedstock operation is very intense. You could take the same  amount of cattle and almost run them in one pasture than what you do in  a seedstock deal, because you breed the certain animal to a certain cattle  and everything. So you can only run about a group of like thirty cows to  a bull. At the height of our seedstock deal, we owned about 450  registered cows  at one time , which is a pretty large registered  operation. Most of the time we   d run about 200 cows, but we usually  sold somewhere.  We had a lot of lease cattle out, too, that I managed with other people.  We had cattle shares out in Missouri, Kansas, everywhere, and I   d sell  the guy a set of registered heifers and then help him, school teacher,  highway patrolman-type fellows, kind of a co-op sales system. We   d  pick the calves up from them and sell them back through our program  because to have a volume in sales, you   ve got to have a volume of cattle.  You might have the best bull in the country, but you might just have one  or two. And if people are looking for a bull, they call you and you say,     Well, I   ve just got two,    and they called Ray   s and they   d have a  hundred. They   ll go to Ray   s to select bulls. That   s just the way it works.  Then your large ranches that come in and buy off you, volume buyers,  they   re going to have to look at a bunch of cattle. They won   t just come  and look at a few. So we run kind of a co-op here for several years, of a  lot of cattle.  And they came to you to get them?  Yes. We   d sell off the ranch.  And they   d come. So you wouldn   t have to     We have a set of sale pens down here. We   d throw, actually, a  commercial sale every now and then. I   d have a public sale, but most of  the time we just did it individually.  So you wouldn   t have to transport too many of them, then.  Well, I would, too. I hauled a lot of cattle. There were two sides to that.  A lot of people will come and buy, and if you   ll deliver, they   re more  apt to come trade with you than they are dragging the trailer. A lot of  26  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  people drag their trailer and come, but I   d deliver cattle to Kentucky or  anywhere. Then I get to see your operation. I get to meet your family. It  gets to be a personal-type thing, kind of like the old gentleman that was  always kidding me in Sharon Springs, Colorado, about my roots on my  cattle. I just had to spend a day with him when I got there. I had to look  at his ranch and his operation and visit, even though I was a shoe  salesman, you become very important to them because they want good  bulls, and they want you to take care of your program.  I dealt with the best people in the world   farmers and ranchers. You  don   t deal with any solider people. Now, I   m not saying there are not  good people in other branches, but people next to the soil are just a little  different. They   re the cream. And there   s lots of history. You go to some  of these ranches   I   ve got to be on some ranches that no way would I  have ever got to go around, but I   ve gotten to be part of those ranches  and get to go, Matador, Coke, Goddards, places like that, Chapman   s  Farms. Places that, probably, I would have never gotten to have been on  those places if I weren   t delivering cattle there and got to be part of.  They   ll have a big barbeque or you   ve just got to go. You go back to  their functions. You become part of their operation.  Just a big community, then.  Well, it is. I got exposed to some things that I wouldn   t have if I hadn   t  been in the field we were in by our   I don   t want to use the word     success,    but by our ability to sell our livestock.  Well, is there a story about the name of the ranch?  Ray Brothers?  7R?  Oh, yes, there is, believe it or not. They   re seven miles west of Atoka on  Highway 7.The first money we borrowed, we borrowed for seven years.  (Laughter) And Ray, there were seven Rays. There was my brother and  his wife, my wife, and we had three kids. My brother didn   t have any  kids, so it was seven R   s. Seven Rays.  There you go. We wondered. (Laughter)  You can almost make a story out of anything.  What does your brand look like, then?  The brand is a seven. People actually, because of my name, Thomas or  27  Finchum  Ray  Nykolaiszyn  Ray  Tinker, will call it a T, but it   s a seven connected R, like that, 7R.  (Gestures)  Simple enough.  I   ve got one right out there, it   s 7R. We   ve branded 7R on the right hip  of our cattle, then underneath them they   d have their individual number,  whatever it   d be, like 324 or whatever they were. Then below that  number, there would be another number, which would be an age brand,  the year they were born. We did that more or less on the weaning  because a calf could be born like, December 31, and another was born  January 1, and you   d have one with an eight, one with a nine or  something like that and there   d just be a day   s difference. Most  everything was weaned in the spring, so we used the spring year for that.  Then we also added another number. We put on the shoulder what was  called a sire code, and it would be the number that   s in the computer,  like, well, old Tradition there, fifty-seven was his code number, and that  cow would carry the fifty-seven. So without the herd books or anything,  when you   re just out there in the pasture, you can see,    Boy, that old  cow   s sure raising a good calf,    and you know what bloodline she is  immediately.  That was strictly for us to start with, was in our program, but my  customers, it actually started, kind of, working with them. Most of your  customers are commercial people. Even though they want good,  registered animals, and they want this and that, that paper doesn   t mean  a lot to them. They look at you as the producer, but they got to knowing  those numbers on my bulls. All the fifty-seven sons would have a fifty-seven  or all the Tradition sons would be   or thirty-eight would have     and they would even order, the bigger outfits, they   d say,    Send me four  of those twenty-nines and send me five of those so and so   s.    (Laughter)  They were putting them in certain pastures, running half-brothers on the  same cows. They   d run half brothers in another pasture. So it was  something that came up out of my program. Guys would even order by  number.  How would you come up with some of the names?  Well, all of our cattle carried the bloodline Raybro. Now, all of our  cattle, if you   ll look at these, they all match Raybro. Then we   d give  them a nickname. But all our cattle would be like Mr. Raybro 435, or  Mr. Raybro 821, and then slash, 821/9 or something like that, meaning a  year brand. All our cattle carried the name Raybro   everything. And  you   ll talk to anybody, they   ll say,    I   ve got a bull, Mr. Raybro. I   ve got  a bull, Mr. Raybro. I   ve got a cow, Ms. Raybro.    (Laughter) All of ours,  the bloodline was Raybro, and then we came along, we   d hang some of  28  Nykolaiszyn  Ray  these nicknames on them, of the deal. When we established our line of  breeding, we established the Raybro line. There were a lot of other  bloodlines that were more famous than ours, more promoted in terms of  show ring and stuff like that, but the Raybro line in gain was established.  That was the name of our operation, so we just named it on our cattle,  Ray Brothers, Raybro cows.  Would you have to deal with any government regulation or   you  laughed  (Laughter)  Oh, honey. From one word to the go, you deal with regulations and not  only that, your associations. We   re seedstock producers, and our own  association will come up with things that you just sometimes shake your  head. I don   t want to get started on that. I really don   t because some of  it   s understandable and some of it somewhat drives you nuts, and still  does. And you   ll have people up making rules that don   t know blank  about what an old rancher   s got to put up with. Back in the Bangs  program, states would get to feuding with each other. One state would  feud with the next state, and they   ll have a regulation, and you   ve got to  try to take your bulls into one state, and you   ve got to do this, and  you   ve got to do that. So it gets to be a little bit hairy, but that   s part of  it.  Missouri and Oklahoma were feuding back there at one time, and I sold  a lot of bulls up in that country. I   d sure get disgusted with what I   d have  to do to try to get my bulls in one state and then another, same way as  delivering cattle. Tennessee   s a long state. I drove into the thing. I  always take my health papers and everything and go up to the port of  entry and make sure that I can get in and everything   s this and that. At  this time, I didn   t have my ranch name on the door of my vehicle. I  learned something. Back then, you operated with farm tags, and you just  about could go anywhere you wanted to with them. They   ve changed a  lot of that, since.  I drove all the way, far way up and finally got me a motel and the next  morning I was almost out of Tennessee. That was Tennessee, yes. Yes, it  was. I always buy fuel. They   ll give you a hard time if you don   t buy  some fuel in their state. I   m getting ready to go out of that state, one of  these port of entries, and I   d already checked in, and I just almost drove  on back. I thought,    No, I might better stop.    They don   t ever mess with  a farmer. They leave him alone. I pulled up to the squawk box and they  said,    Pull around back and park her.       Oops. That doesn   t sound good.     (Laughs) So I pulled around and parked, got all my papers, health papers  and vehicle papers and insurance and all that, walked back up to the deal  and went in to    He   s a good guy, this guy, just kept yacking. They  didn   t pay me any mind and finally I said,    Fellows, is there  29  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  something   ?       Just leave her parked.    I said,    Man, I   ve got a load of  cattle on.       Well, you leave her parked.    I said,    What   s wrong?    Said,     You don   t have your name on the door.    They didn   t look at my health  papers, didn   t look at nothing. I had to get me some cardboard and  marking chalk and fix and put my ranch name on there. (Laughs)They  fined me 100-some odd dollars for operating without my name on my  vehicle. So you run into regulations, but they   re also good points.  They   ve been able to control a lot of disease, been able to help  agriculture an awful lot, and if they hadn   t had regulations, they  couldn   t. I grew up in the time of, you girls probably don   t know much  about it, screw worms. You know anything about screw worms?  No.  They were a terrible plague. It was a terrible situation. They have been  able to, with sterile flies in Mexico, the borders of Mexico, we   ve been  able to stop and wipe out the screw worms. And the same way with tick  fevers and things like that. They dip cattle. So you   ve got regulations.  They don   t let you just head down the road and haul some infected  animal and spread disease. So I agree with it, but they can be a pain, too.  Did your father have to deal with some?  Oh, yes. They came out with programs, this dipping the cattle. It was,  yes. Oh, yes. Dad didn   t have much use for government programs,  either. But his had to do with the Depression. They came out and the  banks had collapsed, there was no money. If you were riding with my  dad right back over here, you   d be riding on an old horse. He could sit  up straight, but he   d go to mumbling, and you knew what it was. And he  said,    I won   t ever do that again. I don   t ever want to       To get some  money, the only way, the government came out with a program. They  dug a ditch and you drove cattle and mules over there, and they shot  them. They paid them like a dollar or two a head or something like that.  To get some money, Dad drove good animals over there, and they shot  them and piled them in a ditch and put diesel on them and burned them  and whatnot.  He didn   t have much use for that government program, but to get some  money their solution was they had to pump some money out some way  or another, and I   m sure there was another side to that. There were  hungry people and all that, but at the same time, there were stores trying  to sell stuff and trying to stay in business. So I guess you couldn   t take  this food and pass it out free. I don   t know how, but they did come out  and shoot cattle that a way. Dad never got over it, but to get a few  dollars, he did it.  30  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  But he also was one of the first guys to start terracing. My dad didn   t  know anything about conservation, I guess, in a way, but I   ve seen him  walk with a rain slicker on. It   d be pouring down, he   d have a shovel.  You knew a cow trailed caused   you look at this old range. You don   t  see ditches and gullies. You   d see him putting motor grass on an old  cow trail or stuff like that. He knew that a wash, if you let it go, would  make a ditch, and so the man had a vast knowledge. It   d just be an  education that he learned growing up. He was good.  Speaking of education, did your brothers and sisters also go to college?  My brother did. My brother graduated from college. Neither one of my  sisters graduated from college. The girls were   it was a different era.  When the boys were pushed out in terms of  work and education , the  girls married and stuff like that and started families and started homes.  Well, if you hadn   t had the G.I. Bill, do you think you would have been  able to     I doubt if I would have. I very much believe in the G.I. Bill. I believe in  it more ways   I believe in compulsory military training. I think every  kid should come right out of high school, boy and girl, rich and poor,  and they should    It did me good. I wouldn   t want to do it again. I  wouldn   t want to go through what I did, but it   s a perfect age. It   s a  perfect age for a kid to   and that   s what your heroes are made out of.  Those kids that are over there right now, they   re young. But we come  back and, probably, the same thing happened in World War II. The guys  came back and went back to college and went on to become leaders and  whatnot. Probably your standard of living, probably your standard of  taxation, probably we paid back our G.I. Bill by the advancement. They  probably didn   t do too good of a job with me, but with some of the other  guys. But I probably wouldn   t have.  Now, at the same time, I didn   t have the right attitude when I went. But  now, maybe a lot of people don   t, because I was right out of the service,  and the girls were there, and it was a party atmosphere. It took me a  while to get everything straightened out, but I didn   t fit in real well. I  realize, now, just because I was twenty years old the day I got home, not  the day I left, I   d fought a war, and we   d been men. You were men, and  you had to come back and start being a kid again. I couldn   t legally go in  a bar, and it was hard to adjust back in the college. I missed a lot. I  couldn   t    The panty raid-type deal and all of that and the hoorah-ing on  campus and all. I couldn   t take the pledging and stuff. They weren   t  going to bust my rear. I couldn   t adjust into some of it, and so I missed a  little for a while to get myself    That   s kind of why I lived off. Later, I  should have taken part more in college life, but I didn   t. But it was an  31  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Ray  adjustment coming back.  At the same time, I can remember getting in a   it was kind of in a  boarding house, eating, and of course, I still had buddies over there.  Everybody   d holler and carry on listening, but I was listening to the  news. The news came on and I was trying to listen to the radio, and one  of the boys jumped, ran up and turned it over to the music, and I turned  it back. The first thing you know, the discussion led into something else.  They weren   t interested in the war. In fact, to them, they were worried  about if they missed class, they   d lose their deferments. It took me a  while to get that stuff out of my system. And all the boys did. But you  had to go back to being a kid again and you can   t.  Dances? Did you attend?  Oh, yes, but some of the dances I was attending weren   t school  functions. (Laughs) In fact, it was even like the dating scene, the little  girls back then had to be in at the dorms at a certain time and all that.  Heck with that. They had a bunch of WAFs  Women in Air Force  up  there, the Air Force Personnel, going to school. That   s who I would date  was those WAFs. Sororities, I got fixed up   show how dumb I was. I  thought sisters were sisters. I didn   t know at the time. (Laughter)  Is this where you usually ask how you met your wife?  Yes.  Do you want to tell how you met her, then?  Oh, she was a local girl here. Dale Byrm, her older brother, and I played  football together, and I knew he had a little sister. She   d be out there.  You know how the kids are on the sideline type deal. She was a little  cheerleader, but I think she was a freshman when I was a senior or  something like that. Anyhow, you go off and in two years, a girl grows  up a lot. I mean, they really change from that. So I came back and  walked in the local drugstore, and drugstores back in my time were  pretty well a gathering place, and Skeet Carnie, the local guy, proprietor  that owned the drugstore, he was,    Oh, the heroes return     all that kind  of deal. A couple of little old girls were buying something there, and,     Aren   t you going to kiss the hero?    and,    Here he is     and all that.  They were embarrassed and I was too, and I kind of got out of there as  fast as I could. I got down the street, and I got to thinking,    Boy, that  was a cute little old girl, but she sure did look familiar.    Then it hit me.     That   s Dale Barnes   s little sister. She grew up.    (Laughs)  So I scrounged around and scrounged around and kind of walked back in  32  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  there, and I think I drank a malt, and I bought a cigarette lighter, and I  did this and bought that. Finally, I asked her for a date, and she accepted.  I went out of there and headed down the street, and it was probably the  most expensive date I ever had. I happened to think,    I don   t have  transportation.    So I was going by the Chevrolet place, and I went in and  bought a car. (Laughter) So we started dating when I came home, and  we dated about three years, I guess, and then we finally married. It has  been fifty-six years, now, I guess. Yes, fifty-six years. Fifty-seven in  November.  And how many children?  We had three, two girls and a boy.  Are they interested in farming or agriculture or     No. They all have jobs. My son has some cattle here, but like most  ranching people today, it   s a hobby-type deal for him. My daughter  teaches school. Another daughter does medical research. She graduated  from Stillwater, too, microbiology, biochemistry.  So in high school, were you thinking you would be a farmer?  Oh, I think so. I never really thought about anything else. I know when I  started college, they gave us aptitude tests and stuff like that, and I think  the last thing they wanted me in was in agriculture. I think it was a  fireman or something that way, and I wasn   t qualified to be on there. But  no, I knew I would always be. We had cattle and horses and stuff,  growing up as kids. I never really aspired to   I   ve often thought about  what I could have done and then the fields that you could have gone  into, but the soil is a good place. It   s a good place. It has changed and  been gobbled up.  This section we   re sitting in right here now, I go to town to the coffee  shop, and a guy will be complaining about his neighbor or something  that way. Well, there are two houses in this section and both of them are  mine, the old home place and this one. There   s nobody else that lives in  this section. The section north of me is the same way. The section over  that way, there   s one house on it. I   ve never had anyone holler at me, in  growing up,    Get out of my yard     I   ve always fished and hunted, rode  horses and swam in the strip pits and lakes and whatever I wanted to.  The country kids growing up, at one time were kind of   we had it kind  of tough. We were considered   rode the school bus-type kids and we  were   but now, the town kids look forward to us. We have everything  that they do and they don   t have. I know the kids love to come out to the  ranch because they can ride horses, and we have electricity, and we have  33  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Nykolaiszyn  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  indoor plumbing, and we have everything that was nice. So I   m seven  minutes from easy, from the coffee shop. So that   s pretty easy living.  Well, about how many acres do you have now?  I have about 450 acres left. I   ve sold off three of the ranches and cut  down and sold off four of the places, really. I   m going to hang on to this.  It   s pretty well most of the old allotment and let the kids fight over it.  Do you have your first tractor, still?  No. I sold that. No, I don   t. I don   t. In fact, that was another thing. Dad  didn   t have modern equipment. He didn   t have stuff like that. He was  still a horse guy. He   d still farm with teams and stuff that way. (Laughs)  My brother and I got the first tractor, I guess. We didn   t have a lot of  modern equipment growing up. We did the horseback. Like I say, my  brother and I didn   t even have a stock trailer when we started. We didn   t  even have a head gate. We had a snubbing post. Now we   ve got  hydraulic chutes and everything, so we   ve come a long ways.  Night and day.  Night and day, yes ma   am. It   s just night and day.  What are some of the current structures on the original home place?  New structures or old?  New.  Well, we   ve got, like I say, we didn   t used to have a decent lot or pen.  We have steel pens. We didn   t used to have good working facilities.  This is selling facilities down here, just strictly use them to sell and sort  cattle and got lights and loading facilities. Up at the other place I   ve got  round pens and squeeze chutes and sorting alleys and got a calving room  and birthing deal and got it fixed. Used to do it out in the open, you  know what it   s like. Got running water, got electricity. All-weather  facilities and stuff like that.  And a lot of fence row to maintain?  Oh, yes. We   ve still got a lot of fence rows to maintain.  And how do you do that these days? Not by horse, probably.  No, no, no. We go in and, actually, we   ve got chainsaws and brush hogs  34  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  and stuff like that, things that you can keep, and weed sprayers and all  that stuff.  And go by truck or by four-wheeler or what?  Well, I   ve got four-wheelers, and I   ve got trucks. Used to, everything  was  by horse . In fact, if you just told me one time you   d see Tinker  Ray without a good cow horse, I   d have called you a liar because that  was just impossible. But actually, I   ve got four-wheelers, and I   ve  always had good dogs. I   ve always been a dog man. My dad was a dog  man, too. I can take my four-wheelers and my border collies, and I don   t  have to use a horse anymore, but I still miss them. (Laughs)  Well, that picture you showed us earlier was your grandfather?  My great-grandfather.  Great-grandfather. And these were Russian     I think my dad called them Russian wolfhounds, but I don   t know for  sure. They look like a cross between a staghound and a   a Russian  staghound, I believe, is what he called them, but they looked a lot like a  greyhound. They were supposed to have been real fast and could run  stuff down.  And what kinds of dogs did your father have?  Dad had mostly, he had pretty well collies and German Shepherds and  whatnot, just kind of cross dogs. His were kind of mutts, but they were  good. They were trained. Dad   s horses handled good. He didn   t just  have something running loose, they mind. And  my wife  asked me one  time, because I   ve been known for my dogs probably as much as I have  my cattle, and she asked me, said,    Where   d you learn that?    I never  thought about it, but I grew up in the tutelage of a man that was   his  horses mind, his dogs mind, and they would do something. So I guess he  passed that on down. We   ve had good dogs, good horses, but the four-wheeler  didn   t replace the dogs.  I   ve had some funny things happen with my dogs. We   d have these  cattle tours come by here, and people like to watch a dog work. Those  dogs have helped me sell a lot of cattle, I mean, just set the atmosphere  right quick. If me and you were kind of haggling there, and it looked like  the sale wasn   t going just right, I might squall at that dog and let him  move over and shove that bull around a little bit. (Laughs)  Up negotiation a little bit.  35  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Nykolaiszyn  Ray  Yes.  He   ll earn his supper.  Well, they want to work. They   re very intelligent, but all that   s past  history now.  Did you or your father have much interaction with county agents?  Yes. All of us did, and the county agent was pretty important to my dad.  We didn   t have veterinarians and things like that in the local deal. We  didn   t have that. A lot of people filled in a lot of different places. Your  banker was also your advisor, more, or your attorney was part of the  family. They weren   t just attorneys. They   d come out quail hunting with  you, and they   d help you plan your operation. So when they got county  agents that was kind of the same way, too. I can remember the county  agent was also almost a scout master, too. He   d be involved with the  kids more ways than one, and he   d also help your dad. He was kind of a  local vet, too. He had more knowledge about some things. So they were  very important. And then they   d come out with new seeds and grasses  and things like that, and they   d show people.  My dad, really, he was more progressive than I realized because they   d  have demonstrations here on this old place, and the first terracing was  done out here and stuff like that. So he was a forerunner that I didn   t  realize he was, but he was working. And a lot of that was county agents  and people that had some knowledge because back there one time, you  were just pretty well limited. You didn   t travel a lot. Now, my dad  would go to town. He   d go on horseback, he   d go back and forth quite a  bit, but we didn   t. Our functions, the cake walks and pie suppers and  school functions were all right out here in this community. Politics was  right out here in this community.  I can remember the first radio that I ever heard. Back in my time, a kid  had to be quiet around the grownups. When they were together, they  were having a discussion. The kid had to stay back, and I didn   t know  what   but it was 1938, I believe it was,    38,   37, when Joe Louis fought  Max Schmeling, the German, and we rode down to a neighbors down  here, was a great big box and all of this and that and the men ganged  around. Boxing used to be a big thing back when we were kids. Joe  Louis was quite a thing. He was the first black that really did something  for their race in terms of sports that I knew of, but he fought this  German.  Oh, men teased you back then. They   d tease kids and pull stunts on us  36  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  and stuff like that. Mr. Baxter was in the bunch and he was quite a tease,  but I didn   t know what a radio was, and the men were in there listening.  They   d swing and this and that and everything. Well, us boys had to  kind of stand back. When it was all over with, Dad and I were riding  back and the old battery powered radio, a great big old thing, and Dad  was trying to explain to me about this radio, what it was, and Dad didn   t  know a lot, either. But the sound came out of the air, and all I could  envision was some guy up there with a bullhorn  (Laughs) Now, this  sounds ignorant to a person today, but we didn   t even have electricity. I  didn   t know what electricity was when they started running out the lines,  but that was the first radio. Then I remember the first TV, and all that.  Now, I   ll come on down and I   ll ask you all. What will be the next form  of home entertainment that will replace those things? See? We never  thought, but radio was something. I didn   t know what it was, and Dad  told me it was sound coming out of the air. Well, I didn   t know.  Sputnik.  I guess  (Laughter)  Well, what is it, do you think, about this land and about your family that  has made all of you want to hold onto it and stay on it?  It   s probably something you can   t explain, and I have to watch myself. I  get emotional. I don   t like that, and it bothers me. As I   ve gotten older,  I   ve gotten to where it   s a    But this land is very important. And in fact,  I   ve argued with pipelines, I   ve argued with high lines, I   ve argued  with    I   m known as a hard son of a gun to deal with when it comes to   this land . And people say,    Well, why don   t you sell some of that off?  Why don   t you do this and that?    Well, once it   s gone, it   s gone.  In fact, I   ve served as the director of the Cattleman   s Association, and I  would always serve on the landowner   s committees. That was always  where I was wanted, and landowners    rights are disappearing. They   re  disappearing very much so. They are encroaching on land every day. In  fact, they   ve got it now where they can just almost take your land, if it  can be shown that it   s more important. See, always for public use was  the only time they could take your land, but now they can take it for  private development, and that   s a bad deal because more taxation. That   s  what it is.  The land   s been good to us. You never were rich, but you always  seemed like were able   you had to go through droughts and depressions  and everything else, but your land was very important. It would help  you. And you could turn it into cash, the cash will disappear. I don   t  know. I   m sure to other people it   s not important, but to me it   s  37  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  important.  Well, I mean, your father walked on it, your mother walked on it.  That   s right. That   s correct, and I know what they went through. They  went through some hard situations. Not that I   m sharp, but I   ve had the  best of jobs, I   ve had an education, I   ve had all kinds of opportunities.  We   ve never known bank collapsing. You think about that. You   ve  always had a credit card. You   ve always been able to charge. Those  people woke up one day and they didn   t even have a bank. Now, let me  tell you.  And they were still intent on keeping this land.  That   s right. They did everything they could. They did anything, and yet,  they were still honest. I don   t know how honest people would be today. I  can remember where bankruptcy was almost considered an absolute sin.  Now, it   s part of a business plan. We   ve gone from one thing to the  other, and I don   t know.  Well, did church play an important role in your  upbringing ?  Oh, yes, yes. We grew up Baptist. We celebrated over a hundred years,  this church has down here. My mother was a Methodist. It   s kind of a  funny deal, but the only church that was right here was a Baptist. She   d  hook the wagons up, and she took us when we were little, drug us to  church. So we grew up in the church. We grew up in the local schools,  right across from the church. We still go to the same church. I started in  diapers and I was going to the other ways in that same church. (Laughs)  What were some of the holiday celebrations?  Well, back then, I think people looked for any holiday. Everything was a  community thing. They   d gather up. Halloween was a big time. Even,  Momma, the grownups would try to fool each other. They   d home spun  stuff, but they   d have a mask, and they   d gather up somebody else   s  clothing or whatnot and pillows and try to   but cake walks, pie suppers,  Fourth of July, everything was   even harvest time was a celebration.  They   d even gang up and go gather pecans. It   d be wagon loads. We   d  kind of go camp down at the bottoms and, of course, us kids would  swing around and frail trees and stuff, but the grownups would gather  pecans. They   d go gather berries and stuff like that.  Hog killing time was a big time in the fall, and neighbors would gather,  working cattle. They   d gang up and oh  In fact, there were a lot of times  I didn   t know these people weren   t my relatives. They were around so  38  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  much that you were raised with the community. This community raised  me, and this community had authority over me, too. Not just my folks.  Anybody here could straighten me out, and they needed to. And I   ll tell  you what, when they came and reported to my folks, there wasn   t any  way I was going to get out of it. But the community raised me.  How would they discipline you?  They   d bust your bottom.  No time out, huh?  No, no  (Laughs) That was kind of funny, too. Mother raised us pretty  well. I didn   t realize this as much, but Dad would leave out before  daylight, more or less, and come in after dark. I   ve seen my dad come in,  icicles hanging off his hat. Men rode and worked, but you could push  mother. We   d push Mother just as far as we could, but we didn   t want  her to turn us over to Dad because when he came through the door, there  was no appeal. When she said,    Ralph, so and so,    I couldn   t lay it off  on my brother because, now, I was going to get a busting or I was going  to get straightened out. It wasn   t abuse. It wasn   t any of that type of  stuff. We were required to commit to certain standards, but at the same  time, the neighbors could   we were required when we were around our  neighbors, we had to act a certain way. I never heard my parents saying,     My kid didn   t do that,    or,    My kid wouldn   t do that.    I   d rope a  mailbox and drag it down the road. I was going to get busted for it, and  that   s all there was to it.  When you were raising your own children on this place, I   m assuming  they grew up in this house, too?  Oh, yes, yes. Well, we started out up in that other place. We   ve just only  been in this thing about thirty-something years, now. But oh, yes, my  kids worked here on the ranch, worked hard.  I was going to say, were some of their chores similar?  Well, we always, everybody did, got to orphan calves and always got to  feed them most of the time. We were always feeding and doctoring  cattle and baling hay. It was always work with old ranches, building  fence, chopping ice. We were always doing things like that.  Did they have some of the same community-type memories?  Not so much. They did away with the rural schools and all. Once you  did away with the rural schools, your seat of rural government left, and it  39  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  started all going to town. So they pretty well grew up almost the same as  town kids, but they still had the country background, too. They grew up  on horses and had their show cattle and stuff like that. In fact, I was  laughing with my daughter here this morning. It   s funny how when  you   re a kid, you don   t pay attention. She rode a horse she called Catch  Up, and she rode him for years. I didn   t think any about old Catch Up,  and one day we were selling bulls down there. She was always helping  me, and she drove these bulls up and was just kind of holding them  while these guys were looking at them. One of these guys said to her  what her horse   s name was, and she said,    Catch Up,    and I just heard  her. He said,    Table ketchup?    and she says,    No. Catch Up.    She said,     Daddy   s always       When a kid rides   and I did the same thing when I  was riding with my dad   kid   s riding over here, and they   re riding over  here and back there, and Dad was always hollering,    Catch up    at me,  too. She said,    Daddy   s always hollering,    Catch up.       Her old horse   s  name was Catch Up, and I thought it was ketchup. (Laughs) But those  kids have these memories and things that they grew up out here.  I know one thing. I don   t know how many clutches and rear ends I had  to put in my trucks. She drove a feed truck to school. She taught all the  kids how to drive a stick shift. I didn   t know this until later years. Come  to find out, the other girls would tell about,    Oh, Mr. Ray, I learned how  to drive a stick shift in your feed truck.    And that   s why I was losing so  many rear ends and clutches was the kids driving the feed truck because  they all had their cars all automatics. (Laughter)  And what was your daughter   s name?  Beverly.  Beverly. And the son?  And the other girl was Valerie. Julie   s my granddaughter. She used to  live with us so much, I keep thinking Julie, but two daughters, Valerie  and Beverly, and my son was David.  Any stories about them you want to add?  They   re good kids. We   ve been blessed. They   re all different. They   re  good moral kids, raised good families, they   ve been hard workers.  They   re successful. Oh, I   m sure they   ve pulled stunts like everybody  else, but the law has never brought them home. We   ve never had the  dope problem. We   ve had friends that had to put up with some terrible   things . My kids have always been  good  and to their credit, they all  walk their own beat. Now, Dad, he doesn   t dictate to them. They   ll stand  up to Dad, but they honor us. They come back and love us. I   m proud of  40  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  my kids.  Momma and I   ve   we   ve seen so many families that struggle with  things that we haven   t had to struggle with. Beverly   s boys, our  grandsons, were here this morning. One of them is graduating from the  eighth grade and the other one   s a freshman at Tushka. They just had a  terrible storm and everything down there in their school, blew it away  and all that. He   s wearing a deal, let   s see,    I survived, I   m a Tushka  Tiger. I survived the Tornado.    They   re the Tigers, is the name, he   s  wearing it. But they   re good boys. And they have their cattle that they  show and they work, too.  They may be attached to the land, too?  Well, they bought a big part of it. They bought two of the ranches, and  bought a bunch of the cattle, so yes. They   re carrying on, and there   s a  seedstock here. There   s enough that somebody   s liable to drift into it  before it   s over with.  What do you see for it the next hundred years?  Well, I don   t know. If you   d have asked me back as a kid, I wouldn   t  have told you that I   d have probably made it. I know ranching and  farming   s hard. It faces a lot of things and Ag   this nation has been  strong, and I don   t think people ever realized that it   s almost biblical. If  you go back and look in the Bible, the strong nations had good food,  cheap food, and plenty of it. And that   s what made a nation strong.  Where you get into your rights and your governments falling and all that  is where people aren   t well fed and taken care of. And this nation has  been able to not only feed itself, they   ve been able to feed a lot of other  parts of the world, but we   re fast declining in agriculture. And  agriculture was the last thing that we had left. We don   t have the steel  mills anymore. We don   t even have the oil. We don   t have anything that  we   re leading the  world  in, but still was agriculture, and we   re fast  slipping in agriculture. Where will we be when we fall down in  everything? You have any idea how many thousands of acres goes under  asphalt and concrete every day? You don   t think about it.  Can   t imagine.  You can   t think what we   re losing every day. As long as a nation is well  fed, they   ll be a strong nation. My ancestors have been part of that, and  I   ve kind of done the same thing.  Well, we thank you that you   ve done the same thing. Anything else you  want to add before we close off? When we first got here, you were  41  Ray  Finchum  Ray  Finchum  talking about the difference in a baseball hat and a regular hat.  Well, all these things have evolved, now, because the hat, the cap has  become a way of advertising and it   s not only just something we wear.  But in my dad   s time, a hat was very important. It was not only  something that you had on your head for protection, but I   ve seen my  dad many a time take his hat and dip up water and give his horse a drink  or something like that, or would curl it up and drink out of it himself as  far as that goes, and just different things. But a hat was a very important  part of his culture, and I grew up with a hat. And still, in fact, if you   ll  go out and look in my truck, I can   t wear a hat in the truck anymore.  They   ve got the back piece there for your head, so I   ve got a cap and a  hat in my truck, and so I put my cap on and ride down the road, but then  I get out, why, I put my hat on. (Laughs)  And what did your father call caps?  Well, he said you were a jelly bean if you were wearing a cap. I get to do  business with some of the sure enough old ranches, now, not just some  of the hobby-type deals, some like where they still work all their cattle  from horseback. They still do everything that way. And all those old  cowboys still wearing hats and now, the wind, sometimes the wind will  get so strong you   ll see them having to tie a scarf over, but they   ll still  wear the hats, and they do give you more shade than a cap. You get  more sunburn and all the problems that you get with just a cap. Now,  wintertime, sometimes a guy will   but the hat has always been part of  the cowboy attire, same with the chaps and spurs and everything else.  I really enjoy going to some of the places I go and some of those guys  have been there their complete lives, and that   s what they wear. They   ve  got to pull their spurs off to go in the house. That   s just the way it is.  (Laughter) I   ve seen the time Mother would meet you at the door,    Get  them spurs off.    Especially when she finally got a little carpeting or a  little rug or something, and she didn   t want you to scuff up her linoleum,  got some new linoleum. You didn   t wear those spurs in the house.  Well, we take our hat off to you. Thank you very much for having us,  today. It was great.  -------  -------
