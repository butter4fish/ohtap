 Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Today is Thursday, October 2, 2014. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn,  and I am in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, along with Tanya Finchum.  We   re in  Amorita  interviewing Tom and Phyllis Clark about the Tom  Clark Farm. Thank you guys for having us today.  We   re very glad to do that.  Well, Tom, I   d like to begin with you. Could you tell us how your family  came to this part of Oklahoma?  They came on     In the Land Run.     Land Run, a horse and buggy, and a few cows, and a few horses. I  think they had two buggies. That   s the way they got here.  And where did they come from?  Now wait a minute.  I think Kansas.  That part, you know, I never did know.  Okay, and when they came here, did they just say,    Hey, that would be a  good piece of land   ? Was there anything special that made them choose  this particular     Well, it was all grass, you know. It was pretty grass, and I suppose they  5  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  just picked one. You know, who knows?  Okay, and so if you could, take me through the different owners of the  farm through the years, how it came down through the family.  Okay, well, it began with   he homesteaded. Then when he died, my  father inherited it and then     His name.  What?  His name.  Ralph Clark. Then when dad resigned, or retired, resigned, too, he let C.  T. and I buy it. We both bought it together. That   s the last     And today?  Well, yeah, today, now, year or two ago I sold my half to him, (of  course, I kept the house where I live) so now he owns it. We also bought  the quarter next to it together, and I sold him my part of it. That   s the  way it is for now.  Do you have any memories of your grandfather?  Oh, yes.  Tell me a little bit about him.  Well, I just know he was an awful good grandpa. He did work me some,  and he paid me a little bit. You know, back then, fifty cents was like a  hundred dollars now. I remember he never cussed. He just didn   t believe  in cussing, which is probably better than me. The nearest he come to it  (and we   ll probably get to this later) I helped him fix fence once along  the  property line  and the fellow that farmed that always let it grow. It   d  cover up his fence, so I helped him one time. We went out there, and we  was pulling up the fence, and I thought he said,    Damn it.    (Laughter) I  said,    Grandpa?     That   s the closest he ever came.  He said,    I said,    Darn it   .    You know I remember that like   and I was  only   seventy-something years ago, but I remember that. I did respect  him very much. You know, people think they come in here and they  homesteaded and they got it free. Well, they did, but just think about  6  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  how it   d be if you were coming here to take a farm and then make a  living off of it. That   s where the work would begin. Now, somebody  give you a farm, just one farm and nothing else, it wouldn   t be long until  you   d lose it.  Do you know much about his wife?  Well, not as much as I did him. I just never got to know her as good  because she was in the house and we was out and such.  I think she was kind of a quiet     Yeah, she was quiet.     person.  So describe where they lived. Describe the farmhouse for me.  We have a picture over there.  Would you like the picture?  We   ll take a look at it after, okay?  Okay. It was just a   the first one   s just a little ol    shack.  Probably two rooms or something.  Yeah, and then they built on. I mean, they didn   t build on. They built a  different house. It just had one story, but I think after they started having  kids they built a two-story, built on the top of it.  We just recently did not have any pictures of the old house here except  the first one, and the cousin that we spoke of in Tulsa sent us two  pictures: one of the farmstead early on with the two-story house, and the  other one with the first house they built, which was only one story. We  have those over there for you to see. What an opportune time for her to  send those. We will let her know we much appreciate them     Oh, yeah.     because, like I said, we didn   t have a whole lot of pictures back when.  Well, in addition to the farmhouse, what else was on the property? Can  you kind of describe it for me?  7  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  P. Clark  Well, I could show you, but there   s an old red barn out there which I can  remember. At that time, when they just had horses, they   d pitch hay on  the wagons, and they had slings to put it in. Then they   d drive it up to  the barn, and they   d take them slings of hay and bring it up and put it in  the barn. That   s the way they put up hay then. I didn   t help them do that  at the time, but I got the privilege of watching. The barn   s gone now. My  dad built this round top that   s out there now. There was some more old  buildings, but they   re     They   re in the one picture, the buildings back at that time.  The only thing that   s left of the original is the windmill.  The old windmill that doesn   t have a wheel, it   s still there. It tells us  which direction the winds in.  Did they have a chicken coop?  Oh, yeah, they had a     A chicken house rather?     chicken house, yes.  Had to have chickens.  Had to have chickens and hog pens and cows.  Where would they get their lumber and building materials? Do you  know?  Well     Don   t know?  I think a lot of it came across the border from Kansas. I couldn   t say  what city or town, but I think I remember hearing that.  Had to go to town in their wagon and get lumber. That   s out of the     What was the name of the town?  There was a     There   s Anthony  Kansas .  8  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Yeah, but     There was Corwin that was in Kansas.     but there was a lumberyard in Byron  Oklahoma  later, later on     Later, but not early on.     right over here, this little town, and one in Burlington which is eight  miles further than Cherokee now. I don   t know when they put the  lumberyard in Byron. I can remember it being there.  Well, in addition to livestock, what other crops were raised back in the  early days?  Wheat and alfalfa. That   s about all that was raised for many years.  And some corn, you said.  Well, yeah, I   d have to     He   s got some notes there.  Yeah, I didn   t happen to look.  It   s okay.  Where we lived, Dad had a little acreage of corn. He had eighty acres,  but he had part of it corn. I can remember him shucking it and putting it  in a corn crib that was out here. In fact, I got to help, what help I was.  They had this corn crib, you know, boards that far apart so they get air. I  remember that corn crib. There   s a few things I can   t remember until  you remind me of it.  How many children did your grandfather have?  Three. I had to count them. Two sons and a daughter.  Okay, and your father, was he the oldest?  Youngest.  He was the youngest.  Very youngest.  9  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Okay. So when you came along   tell me how your parents met. Let   s  talk about your parents. Tell me a little bit about your mom and dad.  Well, Mom   s folks had a grocery store in Byron, and I suppose that   s  how they met. I don   t really know, but that   s what I think. They married  pretty young, but like I say, she died pretty young.  And you had two sisters.  Yeah, but in the very middle.  He   s the middle one.  Okay.  Yeah, I had a  sister  on each side of me. We won   t talk about that.  (Laughter)  When you were coming up, did you live on the farm, or did you live  someplace else?  No we lived   I was born on the farm, one mile south and one east, just  three miles from here...  Okay.     that Grandpa used to have.  So as a little boy, tell me about some of your chores on the farm. You  mentioned a few things you were doing with your grandpa.  Well, I guess one of the things, bringing wood in for the stoves.  Probably gathered eggs.  Oh yeah, gathered eggs and fed the hogs, and when I was, say, maybe  six or seven I started milking. I thought I was smart, but that was stupid.  We milked ten cows down there all the time I was in school. Believe me,  that   s probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life, learning how to  milk. I thought I was smart, you know, but I wasn   t because we did the  milking before I went to school. That   s one thing.  So you would have to get up pretty early?  Yeah.  10  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Now tell me, was your father   did he have a job off the farm, or was he  just a full-time farmer?  No he, I don   t think he really cared about farming, but he had another  job not too long after he got to farming. He was an insurance salesman  for the crop insurance. He sold that for quite a while.  What did he do early on? He had some other jobs.  Well, I don   t     I can   t call them to mind right now.  You know, the     I remember you saying he was going somewhere to work.  Well, he had to go a lot of places to sell crop insurance.  When he was younger.  Yeah.  What about your grandfather? Was he a full-time farmer, or did he have  a job?  No, my grandpa was strictly a farmer. And he must   to me, he did all  right. He homesteaded this, and then he bought the farm just a mile  south, and then he bought an eighty   . You know, back then, you  farmed for a living, if you could raise enough to eat. It was altogether  different than it is now. Believe me, I know.  When your father took over the farm, did the livestock or the crops  change?  Well, I think he still milked cows down there, and I don   t know for sure.  I think they sold everything, the horses. Of course by then, the horses  was gone and the     Just farmed the crops.  Yeah, he just farmed this and the eighty down there.  Do you remember the first tractor?  Oh, you better believe it. (Laughter)  11  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  Tell me about this tractor.  It was a B John Deere, and we raised row crops down there. I think it  was a    38 model. I was eight years old when I got to drive it about, all  the time, really, and I liked it.  How old were you?  Eight.  Eight.  I think it was a    38 tractor, and I got to drive it, so it was my tractor.  My grandpa had an old D John Deere, and he let me drive it every once  in a while, too. You know, I was born partner. That   s all they are, too.  I   m assuming you didn   t get paid at eight?  His grandpa did pay him a little bit.  Yeah, grandpa usually paid me, if I remember right, fifty cents a day  when I   d work all day, and I was tickled to death. You can   t imagine  what we could buy in town with fifty cents.  Money in his pocket.  Well, in those early days with your grandfather and your father, where  would you take the crops to market? Where would you go?  Well, what I remember, there   s an elevator out over here at Byron, what  I remember, so it wasn   t two mile.  Possibly before that, they went to Corwin.  Well, that I don   t know. Corwin might not have had an elevator before  Byron.  It   s just into Kansas.  We used to have a railroad right through here, right on this other quarter,  that come through here to Byron, this prosperous little town. Now it   s  nothing.  Well, tell me a little bit about the water on the farm, the different water  sources.  12  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Well, they had a cistern. They drained the water down a hole. Then they  had pretty good water here, not the best. Now we   re on rural water  which comes off one of my places three mile east, but I have to pay for  it. I shouldn   t put that in there. (Laughter) I probably said some things  you want to take out of there.  You   re doing great. You   re doing great.  Did they build any ponds on the property?  No, Grandpa stopped up a little place for water   for his horses. There  used to be a mud hole, I called it, down here that he stopped it up. There  wasn   t very many ponds around this country. There   s a creek three mile  east.  You weren   t raising cattle, though?  Yeah.  Were you?  With the windmill.  Windmill, okay.  Well, you mentioned you had to milk the cows before school. Where did  you go to school?  Well, the first three years, I went to a school named Rock, which is a  country school just a mile and half from where we lived. I spent the first  three grades there. Then they closed down, and went to Byron. That   s as  far as I went. I didn   t go any further than     He came in to school with me.  How would you get to school?  Well, when we was down there, we walked. Most of the time we  walked. They   d take us sometimes on a real cold day or something. It   s  only a mile and half you know. We could walk. Over here we had a bus,  I think, all the time.  What year did you graduate from     Forty-eight.  13  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  When the farm came into your father   s hands, did you end up moving  into the farmhouse that your grandparents lived in?  No.  Okay.  After he (my father) retired and moved to town, C. T. moved in this  house. I can   t remember actually farming this very much until after we  bought it. You remember anything about that, C. T.? We didn   t actually  farm this place very much until we bought it.  That was in 1977.  Seventy-seven? See, I got to have help.  That   s okay.  So you finished up school in Byron. What year did you get married?  Fifty.  I graduated in the spring of    50, and when he was eighteen, after he  graduated, he and a friend     Joined the Air Force.     joined the Air Force so they could get their duty taken care of. They  signed up for a year, and done six years     In the Reserves. After I got out the first time after a year, the Korean  War     The Korean War started. They called him back in for one more year.  I never did see active duty.  That   s when we got married.  Well, how did you two meet?  In school in Byron, probably in grade school.  She remembers grade school. I don   t.  14  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  And was your family from this area?  Yes.  Yes, I was born and raised around Byron...  They was farmers.     so we have the farming on both sides.  Well, after you got back from the service, then you got married...  We were married, then went to the service.     then what did you end up doing at that point?  We lived in a house over by the creek, big ol    two-story rock house, old   and cold  as could be. (Laughs)  We just rented it, you know. We lived there, I don   t know, for a year or  two.  Probably two years. We got a chance to buy the neighboring farm from  his good friend   s family, and so that   s where we really started up  farming.  But it was a real, real sorry farm. At the time, we thought,    Boy, when  we get that paid for, we can just live on that.    That   s stupid. You don   t  do that no more.  We still have it. I guess we   ll have it as long as we live.  Well, we bought farms all around it, adjoining it.  I had a big garden. We had chickens, and under protest he milked a cow  for a while.  I still had to milk cows because I borrowed the money from that FHA   Federal Housing Administration , and to comply I had to have cows  and chickens. That, believe me, is the only reason why I did that. At the  time on that farm, I wasn   t farming very much. I just hauled hay and  baled hay for a living. That   s all I did, and believe me, when you bale  hay all night and all day and then come home and have to milk them  stupid cows   . I did find out after a few years if you got four payments  ahead, you didn   t have to keep records. You didn   t have to do none of  that. I never worked so hard in my life to get four years ahead. Then,  15  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  four hundred and some dollars a year, which is nothing now, but then     A lot of money.  Right.  So it was tough starting out in those early years.  Well, it was, but we   ve always done it together. I worked with him on  the farm, and he helped me with whatever. Our family started there.  After four years, we started. After four years, we finally started a family.  Yeah, after four years. Through the years, they all worked on the farm.  They all grew up helping. They all turned out pretty good.  Did you stay in that house, or did you eventually move?  We eventually moved. Probably the main reason we moved was because  we had rattlesnakes around there and my daughter got bit by a  rattlesnake. As soon as we could we     That is our oldest daughter. She made it all right. We rushed her to  Cherokee, and they sent her on to Enid. The swelling went up to her  shoulder before it stopped. Of course, she had a specialist there, and they  brought her through it. We didn   t like that place as well after that.  What was happening on your father   s farm while you were working for  yourself now? Would you help out?  Yeah, I   d help out.  Little bit?  Some. We bought a tractor together, a little one. I   d farm his and then  mine. Then I bought another farm, smaller farm, that had more elevation  on it. It finally got bigger and bigger. Then I got a bigger tractor. I  always like to get newer stuff, not especially newer stuff, but stuff that  you can do more with. More fun farming when you get more done.  The original centennial farm was how many acres?  Hundred and sixty.  And so when you   re young and you   re starting out, you started out with  how many acres?  16  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  C. T. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Well     Roughly?  None when we first started, but then we bought 160 acres.  Okay.  That was the farm that wasn   t real good farming. Had some pasture and  a creek.  And then as time went on, so how many acres have you owned through  the years if you wanted to guess, take a guess?  Twenty     Possibly twenty-four or twenty-five hundred I think at one time, and  then we started selling.  I got a map of where it is now. Part of this, me and my son bought  together, but this is the farm.  So, can you tell me, since you   ve come up through the years farming,  how many acres did you need back then versus today to make a living?  How many acres today, C. T.?  Good quarter back then, right?  Yeah.  They made a lot of people that I bought from  a living.   Like his grandpa made a living and raised his family here on a quarter.  The fellow right across the road here, he raised eight or nine children.  Then he got old and wanted to sell it, so he sold it to me. The first farm  we bought, he wasn   t making a living on that farm, so they went to  Wichita, but he wanted to sell it, and he sold it to me. About all the  farms I   ve bought has been because people couldn   t make a living on it.  Were you able to change that? Were you able to make a living on the  land you bought?  Just because it combined with something else.  17  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  Yeah.  Ah, okay.  Yeah. That   s the trouble. You had to get bigger or go somewhere and go  to work for somebody else. That   s just the way it is. I don   t know how  big you have to get now, but you have to be pretty big. See, the problem  is you get fairly big, and then you have children, and if one or two of  them wants to farm you have to have bigger and bigger. Now I   ve got a  child and a grandchild that likes to farm.  Praise God.  There   s no end, see? That   s what I was thinking all my life. You can   t  make it on that one stupid farm. (Laughter)  Well, you mentioned that you weren   t terribly fond of record keeping.  You would try to get ahead. How has record keeping changed through  the years?  Vastly. When we had to keep records for our FHA loan, it was a  monthly record: what you spent for household expenses, what you spent  for electricity, telephone, all     How many eggs you had and how many you sold. It   s unbelievable what  it was then.  I didn   t bring it in, didn   t think of it. We   ve still got some of their books.  Record books. How many cows you milk, how much milk you sell, you  couldn   t do it by computers then.  Through the years as the years went by, at one point I worked for, after  our children got in school, I worked for an attorney at Cherokee during  the   well, I first worked as a secretary. Then after that I worked during  income tax time, so I kept records through that period of years. Did our  income taxes for a lot of years until we went into a partnership with C.  T. Now they do it all by computer. You know that. We don   t. We   re  computer illiterate.  Let   s talk about some tough times on the farm through the years.  Well, the toughest was about a couple, three years after we got married.  Probably   we went through some dry years.  18  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  Yeah, but we didn   t farm very much and didn   t make     The sand blew over there on our first farm and wasn   t very productive,  was less productive than usual.  Did you get through the   80s okay?  Yeah, by then we was on our feet. I think the toughest one was, I forget  what year, about    54 or    5. I worked on the county for one winter, and  the next winter I think I worked on the elevator, building the elevator,  so, see, anything that would make a little extra money. The summer I  could make pretty good money baling hay and hauling hay. That   s all I  did. You can make money doing it; it   ll work. That   s the only thing that  kept me going.  Then when we got to farming more and he had a little more machinery,  why, I joined him in the field. Then for a lot of years I could do about  anything that needed to be done out in the field and running the  combine.  The tractors.  And tractors.  Could you keep a straight line?   Tom could but  no, I couldn   t. When the machinery got so big and  wide, he got a surprise one day when he says,    Run this for a while.    I  said,    Not on your life, dear. I   d have it in the fence.    (Laughs) I still  helped him bale hay until the grandson got out of school in the spring.  I never will forget, I drove the tractor quite a bit. My son got this  guidance  system . I thought, first year when he first got out,    You   re  crazy for paying that much money for guidance,    but if he   d take it away  now, I wouldn   t even think about driving it. You can drive so straight, so  easy.  He loves those straight rows. He can do pretty good without it.  The technology has changed quite a bit.  Oh it   s   the last ten years, since actually I quit farming.  I might add, as our children came along and we were putting up a lot of  hay, we both needed to go to the fields, so the kids had to go, too.  19  Finchum  P. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  Maybe the little one would ride in the truck with me, but we slowly  baled. We got trailers. They loved to ride up on the bales. We was just  very careful, I guess. Never did have an accident with them. They went  from that right to working in the fields. I think we truly have had the  family farm, and it   s a good way to raise your family.  It gives them that connection to the land, too, and want to keep it.  Yes.  Was there any time when you thought you might lose the farm?  No, I was bound and determined I wouldn   t. Of course, when I first  started, it didn   t worry me. I say that because we didn   t have nothing to  begin with. We borrowed money from the FHA, and then I bought it. I  didn   t even get to pay it off until I got the chance to buy another small  farm. It didn   t bother me. That   s the reason I accumulate   anytime  they   d loan me the money, I   d do it. A guy could get in trouble doing  that now, or later when land got a lot higher. They   d get in trouble then.  Did your father sell you crop insurance?  No, he didn   t. (Laughs)  I think he worked mostly in other counties is the reason.  When I bought this place over here, I got crop insurance. He didn   t sell  it because he wasn   t   it   s the only year of my life I really had a  complete crop failure. I knew when I bought it I had to have money for  payments, so I took out crop insurance, and it paid, which most of the  time it don   t pay.  We was saved, I guess, that year.  You mentioned the FHA. Have you participated in any other government  programs?  You mean loan?  Loans, yes.  Soil conservation.  What was it you borrowed from it?  Subsidies.  20  T.

Clark  Well, when she and I bought this and some more, we borrowed from the  Federal Land Bank     Okay.     and we complied with the ASC  Appraisal Subcommittee  all the  time. You had to do that and the SES  Senior Executive Service .  Through the years have you talked to many cooperative extension  agents?  A few, not very many. We didn   t have any land that I thought needed  terraces. We tried to serve the land, anyway.  Did you have any interaction with home demonstration agents?  Absolutely. I was in home demonstration club for quite a few years. We  had a club at Amorita which is, well, between Byron and Amorita. That  was the years that I did a lot of canning because we were growing  garden stuff and such. I had entered some things in the fair during those  years. I think one year I took something on to the state fair. I don   t  remember what it got, but     Do you remember the name of your club?  Jolly Twenty Home Demonstration Club. Of course, it goes by a  different name now. I   m not sure if there still are any of the original  members.  No.  It   s still the Jolly Twenty.  Yeah, it   s Jolly Twenty, but it   s not home demonstration.  It   s just Jolly Twenty.  I probably used the county home demonstration extension agent   s office  a few times, some time I needed to know what bug that was out there.  Were your children involved in FHA or FFA  Future Farmers of  America  or 4-H?  Not in 4-H much, but definitely FFA.  21  Finchum  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  When did the farm get electricity?  Well, I can remember when we lived down there     He was a child.     yeah, it really amazed me, believe it. You flip that light on, and I can  remember that dearly. I slept upstairs, (we had an upstairs) and, boy, it  was nice to flip that light on instead of taking a candle up there. It really  was nice. It was probably about    36 or    7, I   d say, when we got  electricity out on the farm. They had it at Byron, but they didn   t  in the  country .  Yes, in Byron we had electricity before that, of course.  What were holidays like on the farm?  Family times, I   d say, get-togethers. Everybody   d bring something to  eat. I think it was that way back then. Still that way today.  You mentioned earlier that you had chickens when you first got married,  too?  Yes.  Yes.  You need to ask your question.  So everybody seems to have a different technique when it comes to  killing a chicken. What are some of the techniques you recall from your  families?  My mother always wrung their necks. I couldn   t do that. I had to have a  good strong stick put over their necks and pull, toss them down, and  watch them jump. One year I had 200 chickens in our chicken house  because the people that sold it to us had turkeys, so they had a large  chicken house out there. I don   t know why I just got 200 chickens. We  could dress them. I dressed a lot of chickens in my time. (Laughs) We  could take them to Cherokee at that time, and they had a locker plant  opened up that we could get a box and rent. We could put the chickens  in there in boxes. I think I put them in water. I   m not quite sure now. We  could store them down there, and go down and pick up a few boxes to  bring back home. So we had chickens all winter. That got old pretty  quick. (Laughs)  22  Finchum  P. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  Think of different ways to fix it.  I guess I did at the time. That was when our children were little.  Was church a very important part of growing up and then family life  later?  Yes, in Byron it was a very important part.  More for her than it was for me. I admit that. Later on I went. I was kind  of slow because I had things to do on Sunday.  He was kind of slow, but he made it. Our minister in our little church in  town just kept bragging on him. He said,    He   s just done wonderful  since he decided to take the step,    because he took care of the old  furnace in town. We did maintenance work in there and a little bit of  everything until finally got down to such a few and our minister had a  stroke and was gone, so we had to close up. We basically gave our little  church in town to the Cowboy Church, and so far they are still having  church every Sunday as the Cowboy Church.  I go. To me it don   t matter what church you go to. What   s the  difference?  Denomination.  It   s all for God, anyway.  What is the Cowboy Church denomination?  It   s Baptist, under the Baptist jurisdiction, but they don   t have to comply  with all the Baptist regulations and such.  There   s only     Ten?     ten or fifteen, sometimes twenty. It   s nothing.  It   s actually called the Cowboy Church?  Yeah.  Yes. It   s got a sign up over there.  Were your sisters interested in staying on the farm?  23  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  No not really. One of them married a fellow in Wichita, and he worked  in an airplane factory. The other one got married to a fellow in Lubbock,  Texas.  The older one married the Maytag...  Yeah, Maytag dealer, so they wasn   t really interested at all in the farms.  Before we hear from your son and grandson, what do you hope to see  happen to the farm in the next one hundred years?  Well, I hope it stays in the family. How do you see the farms in the next  hundred years?  We hope our farms haven   t been taken over by China or someone.  Yeah, our accountant says if we keep getting in debt, he says     China   s going to own us.        You   re further in debt now than you ever was when you bought it.    I  said,    I   m not.       Yes, you are,    because the government   s got it  mortgaged for more than I ever did. Some of these days the Chinese or  some country will come over here and farm it. I said,    Not while I   m  alive. I   ll shoot them.    (Laughs) But who knows. That we don   t know,  what   s going to happen.  In the near future, we can see that our family is carrying on.  We hope we got enough, they can make a living out of it. That   s the  main idea.  Do you have a favorite time on the farm, favorite season or time of day  or favorite time on the farm?  I think his favorite thing is being out in his tractor out in the field.  Yeah.  It really is. They still let him come out and help them once in a while.  He helped them get the silage in a couple, three weeks ago.  I don   t do much, but I enjoy what I do.  Air conditioned cab these days?  24  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Oh, of course. (Laughter)  Absolutely, that   s got to be a condition at one point.  That   s the fun about farming if you can keep it   . That   s the main idea  with it. Get better, run easier equipment, get over more ground in less  time.  Some have gone to the no-till method. Is that     My son has.  Well, before we learn more about what   s going on on the farm today, is  there anything else you   d like to share with us?  Is there anything in your notes?  Gosh, I don   t know just what all I missed now. I think that we   ve  covered about everything, as far as I   m concerned.  We might say, (I   m just looking at my notes)     Sure.     we lived on the neighboring farm where the son and his wife live  now. We bought it in 1966, so we moved back in this area from over  east. Then in 1983, we built this home and moved in here, so we  basically switched places with the son and his  family.   The big shop was over there, so he needed the big shop more than I did.  I   ve got a shop out here that I built that   s perfect for me. It   s got a heated  floor in it.  Not too shabby, heated floor. Oh, yeah.  Right. All it takes is a little hot water heater. It   s amazing what they can  do.  Another one of the nice advances, we have a geosystem here which we  like very much     When it works.     when it works. Otherwise we was fortunate enough to get a ten-year  maintenance agreement when we bought it, and for some reason we just  25  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  P. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  decided to do that. When it doesn   t work, we call the AEC  Alfalfa  Electric Co-op . (Laughs)  You know, I   d like to, (I don   t know that I want to put this in there) I  want to mention one thing I   m proud of is this land, but I   m more proud  because all the land I bought, they come to me and asked me to buy it.  He didn   t run anyone else off of a farm.  Even on what C. T. and I bought, they come to us.  And it was acquired one farm at a time, of course, through the years.  Because now, though, since this oil deal is     You can   t buy farm land.  Have they leased up your land? Have the oil companies come in and     Leased it, yeah. They   ve got wells where     You kept the mineral rights for all of your property, most of it?  Yeah, there   s just one or two that we...  Those were basically gone before we bought them.  Have you noticed an impact? Has it made an impact not only for your  family but for the area you live in?  At one point I said there   s big, big changes, and I   m not sure they   re all  good. You have to watch out for those big trucks and just a lot of things.  The trouble is that all this oil, to me, it   s ruined the small farming that  farmers are trying to get. It   s raised the price of the land so much it   s  impossible. That   s just the land. You can   t buy any minerals with it if  you buy it. It   s quadrupled. Now, the minerals like this one  school   over here, they leased to Chesapeake for I think it figured out  about 115, 100 dollars an acre which would be about 400,000 for the  minerals. Of course, I leased mine before it was like this now.  (Laughter)  Wait five years and then cycle back around.  We took it as it came.  26  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Finchum  P. Clark  T. Clark  Finchum  T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  No. Five years, I think the wells they   ve drilled on here will be dry and  they won   t want to lease it.  Then land will be cheaper again?  Well, I don   t know. Minerals will, but I don   t know about the land.  You   ve been very determined to keep this particular piece of land. Is  there a reason why?  Family, pure and simple.  It   s just, Grandpa.  Make your grandpa proud, huh?  Yeah, I was so proud when Dad offered it for C. T. and I. That was the  main   . Of course, now it   s right in the middle of our farming.  So now we   re joined by C. T. and Stephen Clark.  Correct.  Okay, and C. T., you   re in partnership with your father. Could you tell  us what   s happening on the farms today?  We created a partnership whenever I graduated from high school, and  we run that for fifteen, twenty years. That   s since been dissolved. My  Dad   s gone into semi-retirement, not totally, so it   s been a slow, gradual,  good transition. It   s mostly in my hands, and now we   re doing the same  thing basically with Steve, to slowly turn more over to him gradually,  too, kind of the same, basically, thing we did with my dad.  How has farming changed today on the land? What are you growing?  Have the crops changed, the livestock?  Probably the biggest thing that I have seen change is, of course,  technology has a big influence on what we   re doing now. We   ve gone  more to no-till which allows us to do more various crop rotations like  corn and soybeans. This is predominantly a wheat country, so we   re  venturing out into some of the other crops now. I know that Steve got  some sesame, and we   ve tried some. You see more diversity than you  used to.  Have a lot of the farms in this area gone to no till?  27  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  I wouldn   t say a lot of them.  No, we   re kind of the forerunners of that in this area. Different parts of  Kansas really have. I just love the benefits of no-till. I mean, you get the  soil conservation benefit. It   s not washing or blowing. You save the  moisture, the nutrients, the fertilizer. To me, it   s a win-win situation  going no-till. You get the benefits of crop rotation, like you said. Like  this year, we had a wet summer. We can take advantage of that, grow  different crops. We grow alfalfa, wheat, corn, grain sorghum, sesame,  canola, a little canola, and they   re all useful tools on our operation now,  taken primarily from a back-to-back wheat operation. I think that helps  us manage our time. We can use more technology that way, and greater  profitability, as well.  Well, let   s take a step back. You grew up learning about farming from  your father?  Pretty much.  Tell me about your chores growing up.  Cool. Probably, from  as far back as  I can ever remember, I always got  up and went with my dad. We did a lot of cattle feeding back then, or if  he was on the tractor, I would   of course, back then we didn   t have  cabs. You just kind of hunkered down and just rode along with him on  the tractor or the combine. Whatever he was doing, I pretty much went  with him. I know for a while my mother worked when I was pretty  young. Never was an option. I just got up and went with him. Anyway,  we   ve done a lot together.  Then, Steve, when you came on the scene, tell me a little bit about your  early experiences working the farm.  Well, I was pretty much the same way. I grew up riding with him at an  early age. Then I would start raking hay and feeding the cows. Simple  projects at first, and then they became more complicated and  challenging. Always had FFA show cattle we raised. That was part of  my chores, taking care of show animals.  I can remember when he was a baby he was a terrible nap-taker.  (Laughter) In the summertime, he just naturally went with me after  lunch, and we would take pillows and blankets. Of course, we had cabs  then, and we   d always have a bed for him, and he   d take his nap. Then  when his nap was over, I   d take him back home. We   re talking one, two.  Then he   d whine because he had to go home. (Laughter)  28  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  I don   t remember that. (Laughter)  Well, what were some fun things that you did around the farm? If you  weren   t working, what was the fun side of it?  Oh, I would have friends over on occasion. We   d hunt, we   d go  camping, I don   t know, play around with the tractors and combines and  little farm animals, baby calves, and stuff like that. Typical farm kid life,  I would say.  Did you play chicken with the tractors?  Probably not. Not when dad was around, anyway.  Not that he   s going to admit, yeah. (Laughs) Well, today take me  through a typical day on the farm. What do you do when you get up?  Today?  Yes. How early do you wake up?  Oh, you know it varies a lot, depending on what we do. Like if we   re  trying to put up hay or a lot of times spray or something, we   re up sun-up  and going, depending on what we   re doing. In the wintertime, we  also run a small feedlot, so we   re usually up, depending on what we   re  having to get done that day before something else has to take place.  Summertime, it   s a little more laid back since we   re no-till. I would say  less labor and more management is kind of the typical routine for no-till.  It   s more managing the situation, so kind of take it as it comes. If we   re  putting up hay, we go to the hay field. If we   re needing to plant, we just  plant or harvest whatever we   re doing that day and pretty much stay  there until we   re done. In the wintertime it   s more, like I say, we   re  feeding cattle, and then if we get done with that we head back to shop  and start fixing up for next summer, working on equipment.  It   s also very weather dependent. If it   s a good day where we can get  harvesting done or planting, we   ll go for long hours. If it   s raining, we   ll  take care of stuff in town, FSA  Farm Service Agency  business or Farm  Bureau business or something like that.  How do you keep up with the weather?  I think we follow the weather. I don   t think we lead the weather. We  manage it the best we can.  Do you use any devices or radio or television? How do you find out  29  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Finchum  C. T. Clark  about the weather?  All of the above.  Yeah. Cellphone apps.  Do you use the Mesonet any?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oklahoma Mesonet is a great tool.  We have, what, three or four apps on our phones.  Yes.  If we don   t like one, we check the other one     Right.     and they   re never the same, so we never know what to   weather   s  always a guess in this part of the country.  So do you find yourself using more digital tools in the field     Oh, yeah.     keeping up with your crops, managing business?  Yes, it   s an everyday deal. Just like you use your iPhone, we use that  technology, as well.  How do you keep up with that sort of thing? Do you think     It   s kind of a deal you have to learn it if you want to use it. It   s a  necessity that   I mean, I guess John Deere puts it in their equipment,  and we learn how to operate it. Just being around it.  If you need it, you   ll figure it out.  How do you do record keeping these days versus how they did it?  Well, it   s not near as hard copy as they did back then. Really, a lot of our  bookkeeping is hired done, so that frees us up to do some other things.  30  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Finchum  Everything   s more specialized now. We don   t have time to keep up with  IRS records or rules and regulations because they change all the time. It  benefits us to have a lot of that bookkeeping hired done. We still keep  our own records, you know, like crop records and all that either on our  computers or on our phones     Yes.     try to keep it backed up.  Well, if you   re trying to get news about whatever, is there a source you  go to, say     Other than the Facebook?  Yes     Okay, all right. (Laughter)     other than the Facebook. So for     I don   t do Facebook. He does. (Laughs)     crops or technology or government programs, do you have different  places you look?  Oh, yes, television programs. OSU Ag Extension is a great source. We  use those. Farm publications.  Internet has helped us tremendously. There   s about anything you can  find   you know. You can find anything you want on the internet. Of  course, you have to figure out which ones you really want to go to. If  you   re having problems with something, you can find out some answers.  Are you both full-time farmers, or do you do something other than     No we   re both full-time.  Pretty much.  And that   s what you wanted to do from the get-go?  Yes, yes.  And you, too?  31  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Finchum  C. T. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  Finchum  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Oh, yeah.  I did work at the co-op for five years after college to help me learn a lot  of stuff with, like, soil science and herbicide use and stuff, how to  manage, how other people manage a lot. I think I can bring that back to  our farm and     I should ask, then, where did you go to school?  Oklahoma State.  When did you graduate?  In    03.  And your major?  Plant and soil science.  Okay, there you go. (Laughter)  Yes, yes.  I owned my first combine when I was a freshman in high school. Owned  my first land when I was a sophomore. By the time I graduated I went     Literally I didn   t get to go to a graduation party because we had to bale  hay that night. Basically went to the farm and never went anywhere else.  What   s the pull? I mean what     I loved it. My love for it.  The smell of the dirt or the feel of the dirt or just     Soil, soil. Dirt   s a four-letter word. (Laughter)  I learned something today: soil. (Laughter) You don   t like playing in the  dirt, either?  Would you like to turn the camera, show how she blushed on that?  (Laughter)  I may have to Facebook that one later.  Right, right. I   ll follow you. (Laughter)  32  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  S. Clark  Finchum  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  Finchum  Don   t. (Laughter)  Well, thinking back about your time working on the farm, this is a family  operation, right? What are just some special memories for both of you  about doing this type of work?  I would say that my wife, Mindy   been married for over nine years, and  she likes doing stuff on the farm, as well. It   s always neat to see her  helping us. She can do stuff, like the grain cart, and I can drive the truck  or combine, and he can be doing another job. My grandpa can still do a  few things, and it   s always neat when we   re all working together.  My wife, Brenda, she came from a farming background. She knows  farming; she knows cattle. We   ve been married almost thirty-eight years,  so same thing. She   s out there all the time, too, when you need her. It   s  just part of the family. Now we   ve got grandkids coming along, too, so  it   s been fun.  Is there anything else you   d like to add before we close on out, anything  you want to tell us?  Well, thank you for making a record of stories and experiences like ours  and our grandparents   . It   s neat for the state to look at, and it   s great to  have a record, a written record, of that for future generations.  I have to ask my question, too. Do you have a favorite time on the farm,  season-wise or during the day?  I certainly do. I think fall is my favorite time, and winter.  Yeah.  Fall, mainly.  Right.  Fall, we   re finally slowing down.  Slow down, cools off.  Summers can be long and hard here.  We   re tired of hot, dry summers. (Laughter)  Well, this was a good summer, though, wasn   t it     33  S. Clark  Finchum  C. T. Clark  S. Clark  Finchum  S. Clark  C. T. Clark  Nykolaiszyn  C. T. Clark  Yes, it was.     compared to last year, anyway?  Yeah, the last couple, three years.  Yeah.  So time of day? Morning, night?  Whenever it   s cool out, so, yes, evenings.  Evenings are my   kind of goes with the fall, kind of all over. Time to  slow down.  All right, so thank you so much for sitting down with us today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
