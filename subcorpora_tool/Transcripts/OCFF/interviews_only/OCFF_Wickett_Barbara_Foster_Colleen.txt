 Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Today is April 30, 2012. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Juliana  Nykolaiszyn. We   re with the Oklahoma State University Library. We   re  here in Kingfisher County, in Cashion, Oklahoma to speak with Barbara  Wickett and Colleen Foster. Thank you for having us today.  We   re glad you   re here.  Let   s get started and have you tell us how your family came to have the  land initially.  Well, my Grandfather Foster got the land, the initial 160 acres, that he  homesteaded in the Run of    89. Then the eighty acres that is right next to  us, he traded for a team of mules. The Fosters came over on the  Mayflower, they settled in Vermont, Tunbridge, Vermont. Wasn   t it?  Yes.  Tunbridge, Vermont, and then they moved and they eventually ended up  in     Kansas.     in Kansas. Of course, it was hot and dry and they couldn   t get  anything to grow. They opened the lands up and manna from heaven, it  was going to be. (Laughs) Everything was going to be wonderful so they  made the Run of    89, my grandfather and        and his brother,  George , and his  mother ,  and Cannie Morgan .   Cannie later became Mrs. George Foster.  They all  four  came.  5  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  So he was already married at that time?  Yes, he was married. Now, she stayed in Kansas with the children.  They already had them.  He made the run and staked out the land. Then he went back and they  came and built the house.  And then her dad was born and he   s the only one that was born here, in  1901.  The rest is history. (Laughs)  He was born in 1901.  And how many brothers and sisters did he have before the move, then?  Five, isn   t that right?  There   s five children?   There were five children. When my dad was born that made six; two  girls, Fannie and Lucille, and four boys, Worthy, Charlie, Shorty, and  T.R. who was my dad.   Do you know how or why they chose the particular piece of land?  They went somewhere else and someone else had already staked it so  they moved on. Because they came down the Cimarron River out of  Dover, they said, and so then they came on down there. I suppose  because they had water, the creek, and all that. But you couldn   t tell  where anything was. You had to go   how they decide their stakes     Dad had written about how they measured that. It   s in one of these  articles that   s in this. (Gestures) That   s why I say, you might want to  take a copy of that back. But they had a way of figuring that out as to  where they put their stakes.  He came on a mule and his brother and the grandma were on horses. He  rode a mule.  And did a dugout?  I don   t think they ever had a dugout.  6  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Some of the other Fosters, his brother and them, I think some of them  had a dugout, but I don   t know what they had until they built the house.  I don   t either. He was a carpenter and a farmer, both. I think right away  they built a house. As I said, this is the house (gestures to photograph),  and just looking at the house, to me, it looks like quite a house for back  then.  Didn   t the lumber come from Guthrie?  Could have.  I think the lumber came from Guthrie.  But for that, if that was the house   unless they added to it. Maybe they  added to it. But that   s a big house.  That   s a big house. It is.  I remember going upstairs and it was very narrow, real narrow, and very,  very steep. I don   t know how they managed to do it because Grandma  Foster was   you can tell she   s a pretty hefty woman. She had diabetes  and she died December 18 in 1941. I was only four years old so I don   t  remember her all that well. She had diabetes and she had to have an  awful lot of trouble getting upstairs, if she did get upstairs. She might  have stayed downstairs, I don   t know.  But there was a swinging bridge across the creek, and the silo is still  there, what   s left of it. But the barn and that stuff was across the creek. I  guess he built all of it.  Yes. Then again, that was probably why they settled there, because the  water was there. I know Dad said when they first moved there, you  could step across the creek. Then erosion came along and by the time I  was old enough to remember, there was a swinging bridge between the  house on one side and then the farm buildings were on the other. So, if  you wanted a tractor and it was over here and you wanted it over where  the house was, you had to go out on the road and go around because  there wasn   t any way to get it across the bridge. It was just a footbridge.  What else do you remember about the house? How was it heated?  It was heated with a wood stove. It had a cistern out in the back that they  got water out of, had a smokehouse. The rooms were small, I remember  that. There was a piano there. I don   t remember how come there was a  piano there because as far as I know, nobody played the piano.  7  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  (Laughter) The rooms were small. My grandfather liked to read. I  remember before he died, he got to the point where he couldn   t live by  himself, and he went to El Reno to live with one of his children, Shorty  Foster. Shirley and Jack and I went in the house and there were all sorts  of old Saturday Evening Post magazines in there. I have since kicked  myself that we didn   t keep them because old, old magazines like that, it  would have been great to have had now.  We don   t need anything. (Laughs)  No, we don   t need anything. We   re already old. (Laughter) But back in  the    50s and like that, it would have been nice to have those.  And they tore the house down after he died.  Yes, my dad tore the house down and used the lumber from there to help  build the house where he and mother lived, on a different part of land,  sectional land.  Can you take us through the steps of how it came to be in your  possession? Talk us through who owned it, and when, as it came down  the line.  Well, Grandfather Foster owned it.  Yes, he   s always owned it. When he died, it went to all his children.  The sheriff   s deed was     Then after he died     My dad bought it the twenty-fourth of January, 1952, he bought the land.  He bought his siblings out?  Yes. That   s been the only two owners.  Both of them are gone now. His dad   I mean the dad and the mother,  and it was left to their three kids.  It   s in a trust right now so when the last of us dies, then it goes to our  children.  We have  eight  grandkids. (Laughs)  So, I assume it will eventually be sold, which is kind of bad because it   s  8  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  been in the family all that time, but nobody farms.  So, when your grandfather was farming, what were some of his crops?  God, it had to have been wheat and feed, oats     Corn, yes. I   m sure.  Of course, they had a garden back then. Everybody had a garden.  They had pear trees around the house. When we got married, I  remember that.  And walnuts. My dad loved black walnuts. They had walnut trees. The  lane from the road to where the house is was long and that   s where the  pear trees were.  But the creek, now, is wide. It   s shale. Do you know what shale is?  (Laughs) Red shale, and has washed out and got wider and wider.  Well, where would they have taken their products to sell?  To Kingfisher.  Closer than Guthrie?  Yes, it would be closer than Guthrie.  But Cashion is almost right in between Guthrie  and Kingfisher . We   re  about seventeen miles both ways, but the farm is closer than away.  We always did business in Kingfisher, my father. We always banked in  Kingfisher. We hauled wheat to Reeding. But as far as what they grew  there, they had to have had cattle and wheat and oats and feed.  Then when your father farmed it, what would he do?  Same thing. (Laughter) It was mostly just wheat, though. That and  grassland, grass.  Like I said in that email, there has never been a mortgage on it. In all the  years it   s been owned, it has never been mortgaged. My dad bought it  outright. It   s had oil and gas leases, but never a mortgage on it. That   s  pretty unusual in this day and age, to have something that hasn   t had a  mortgage on it.  9  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  But my husband talked a lot about his grandpa, because he made  tamarack fishing poles for him to fish there in the creek. Of course, he  wasn   t very old so that   s what he remembers a lot about him.  We used to walk down the creek. When we were kids, we   d walk down  the creek just to walk down the creek and fish or just to walk down the  creek. At that time, the water was much clearer and cleaner than it is  now. Now, it   s got a lot of moss and crap.  It   s just about a mile from the Cimarron River. To the north is the  Cimarron River.  Well, of the children, since your father stayed on the farm, what  happened with the other children?  Let   s see. Fanny, let   s see. This is Fanny, and she lived in Kingfisher.  (Gestures) She was married, and I don   t know what her husband did. I  never knew him. He had died a long time ago. I don   t know what he did.  Worthy was asphyxiated. He was only in his twenties or so. Lucille  never married. She moved to California and worked for an import/export  place. Shorty worked for the railroad and lived in El Reno. Charlie was a  farmer.  Lived in Big Four, didn   t he?  Yes, he lived at Big Four. He and Lucy lived at Big Four.  Right there close to where the farm is.  My dad farmed and taught school. My dad taught school in one-room  schools for years. In fact, my first two years I spent in a one-room  school. He taught at Pleasant Ridge and Lincoln and Mount Everett,  right?  Yes, and then he spent his last years at Cashion. Retired from Cashion.  He retired the year I graduated, in    54.  Where had he gotten his education then?  Central State, in Edmond  (Laughter) Back then, there weren   t that  many colleges around. I think Kingfisher had a college.  Well, he went to there.  Yes.  10  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  He played football in Kingfisher  High School .  No, he played for high school, didn   t he?  Oh, was it high school?  I think it was high school. Yes, he was a football player in Kingfisher  High School. But Kingfisher College didn   t last all that long. And then  when he came here to Cashion, he felt like he had to have more of a  degree or education, what have you, to keep up with the Joneses, so to  speak, with the other teachers. So, he went to school at Central State. He  would go weekends and so forth. He did it for years and years. One of  his classes that he took was photography. That   s what part of these  pictures are. Like this is Grandmother and Grandfather Foster in 1937.  (Gestures) That   s one of his pictures. That   s his car. That   s one of his  pictures. Just because he had to take pictures for class, so he took  pictures of whatever.  Well, in 1937, with the Depression going on, to be able to do that was     Well, it was. And he had three kids.  Yes, and of course my mother didn   t work. Well, she worked, she kept  care of us.  How dare you say that?  (Laughter)  Yes, she definitely did work. We lived in a house with no electricity  back when there wasn   t any electricity. You had your light. When we  finally got light, after World War II was over with, we had a single light  bulb coming down from the ceiling. And my god, we had electricity   That was wonderful. You had a radio. But we didn   t have running water  for years and years. And no bathroom. Then he finally built a shower on  the end of the house that he and Mother rented. They rented a house for  years and years and before the Overstreets would sell the land.  Mrs. Overstreet, she wasn   t married. Her husband had died, and she  wouldn   t sell the land. But when she died, she deeded it to her nephew.  He and his wife finally decided they would sell the land, that my mother  and dad lived on, to them. So, after they sold it to them, he eventually  built a house in 1950   let   s see, I graduated in    54. He started it in    54  and finished it in    55. So, up until that time, the homestead had been     the house had been there, but no one lived in it. Grandfather Foster, he  moved. He got older and was by himself. He moved to El Reno with  Shorty and his wife. We certainly didn   t have any room for him.  11  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  (Laughs) And with us three kids, it would have driven him nuts. Shorty  and his wife didn   t have any children around so they could care for him.  But they   d come out every so often and bring him and he   d go down to  the farm or whatever.  What were some of the other buildings on the farm?  There was a barn with a shop and granaries in the barn and the silo.  A smokehouse.  Yes, and a smokehouse over by the house. That   s about it.  And those big shale rocks was usually the foundation for things. So,  when my husband was doing the farming then, I would drive the pickup  down there and pick up those rocks. You can see I   ve got rocks  everywhere. I won   t tell you what he said. (Laughter)    I   ve been  throwing those rocks away all these years and now you   re carrying them  home.    (Laughs)  And they   re out here.  Yes, there   s rock all around, but they   re big shale rocks. But we   ve  found lots of little things down there, little bottles, and the grandkids  have all been down there hunting stuff.  One time, Paul and I went down there and we walked along the creek  bank. Back then, you had bottles and you filled up the sack and you   d  throw it over the creek bank. That was just what you did back then  because you didn   t have landfills and all this other stuff. It   s amazing  some of the bottles and stuff that you can find. Probably not now  because I   m sure people have gone along and picked them up. But at one  time they were there to pick up.  What were holidays like in this particular house?  That, I do not know. Like I said, I was only four when my Grandmother  Foster died. I just don   t remember. I do know that after we got old  enough to know there wasn   t a Santa Claus, we didn   t really have  Christmas. (Laughter) I mean, Christmas was just kind of another day  and that was it.  Yes, because I thought it was strange because they didn   t do all that for  Christmas and in at our house it was a big deal.  Yes, as kids, we   d go to school and we   d come back from Christmas  12  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  vacation and everybody,    What did you get for Christmas?        Well,  didn   t get anything.    (Laughs) Because we didn   t celebrate Christmas.  We just didn   t do it. I don   t know whether Dad was raised that way. I  don   t ever remember him saying anything about going to church. Do  you?  No, I remember him saying the grandma did. Maybe she didn   t take  anybody. (Laughter)  She might not have. (Laughs)  I remember him talking about her.  Like I was telling Colleen before you got here, I said,    The one thing I  particularly remember about my Grandmother Foster was       I was a  little kid and she always had a candy bar, a Hershey candy bar in the  refrigerator ice box, in the ice box when we would come down there.  She always had   and they were short on money. They were like  everybody else, they didn   t have much money for thrills or candy or  whatever. Grandpa had to have his tobacco and she bought tobacco, but  she also had enough money that she would get a candy bar for us kids. It  was maybe just one candy bar, but it was divided off in those little  squares so everybody got a chunk.  How old was he when he died?  Grandpa Foster? Oh, gosh, I don   t know.  He died in  1950. He was ninety-one.   She died in    I don   t know. We   ll have to figure that out.  He made the Run  when he was sixty  and died April 22nd. But I don   t  remember how old he was. Well, it doesn   t say when he was born.  Well, let   s see. My father entered Oklahoma April 22, 1889 and passed  away April 22, 1950. He retained his residency on this homestead for  exactly sixty-one years. He was  ninety-one  years old  at his death .  No, he was a resident there.  Oh, yes. He was a resident there.  I think he was ninety-something. He   d have to be because he already had   five  kids. Unless they started early. (Laughter)  13  Nykolaiszyn  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Would you have chores when you   d visit the farm growing up?  Did I have chores?  No.  No. (Laughter) Heavens, I was just a little kid. I mean, I was just a little  kid. When Grandma Foster died, I was like four years old. So, no, I  didn   t have any chores. Now, the boys didn   t because we didn   t live  down there. Now, when we grew up, we had chores at home. We had  chores.  But your folks lived down there     After they were married.  After they were married, yes. They lived there with him.  I don   t know when they left when he had rented Overstreet   s land.  And where was that in relation to the farm, the Overstreet land?  It   s south.  It   s south.  Probably eight miles.  Yes, we used to drive cattle. After Dad got the farm, we used to move  cattle from our place where we lived, by the road. We herded them down  the road. (Laughs) If you can imagine, we herded them down the road to  the Foster Farm down there at Big Four. You don   t realize how many  bridges there are to cross or how many intersections there are to go  through until you   ve got a herd of cattle and you   re back here and the  head cow is up there leading them. You just hope to heavens she doesn   t  turn and go down that road. (Laughs) We had some hairy times, I  remember, but we always got it done.  Well, it   d take a while to go eight miles, wouldn   t it?  It did. Yes, that was an all-day job. Of course, you had momma cows  with baby calves. And you had the bull, and he was always dragging up  the rear. We had one old cow that was the lead cow. She was good  because she   d made the trip a whole lot of times so she knew where to  go. (Laughter)  14  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Nykolaiszyn  Foster  Wickett  Foster  I think that was in the Foster men that they liked to move cows.  (Laughter) Because we did it, but not that far.  You didn   t have trucks and trailers back then like you do now, and so  you just put them on the road.  Would you be on a horse or would you be walking?  We   d be walking.  You didn   t even have a horse, then, did you?  No, didn   t have horses. My dad didn   t like a horse. One time, he and my  mother were in a hospital, I think maybe in El Reno. They were in a  hospital someplace, and a little girl came in that had been riding a horse  and she fell off and her foot   she got drug and they had to amputate her  arm. After that, anybody said,    Horses,    they said,    No, not going to do  it.    So, we didn   t have horses. No, you walked behind them. (Laughter)  You didn   t know any different, so it was okay. Everybody did things  like that.  And the roads were probably dirt at that time?  Still are. (Laughter) Still are. Shale, some of them are shale, but there   s  always dirt under that shale, too.  You mentioned a smokehouse. Did they have hogs or pigs that they  actually smoked?  Yes, they had hogs. They had hogs, and I   m sure they smoked beef, also.  But, mainly it would have been hogs. Of course, they had chickens.  Everybody had chickens. Do you have chickens?  No, but I think everybody has a different way to slaughter a chicken. Is  there a trick in your family?  Yes, mine is. I just stepped on their head and jerked it off.  My mother put a stick down, and she stood on the stick and pulled up.  When you pull up, you throw it like that because all the blood splatters  and you throw it like that. (Gestures) I can remember, she   d get blood on  her,    Gosh, darn it, I got blood on myself     (Laughter)  My kids think it was awful because I just stepped on their head and  jerked it off.  15  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Then you scalded them and picked them and     That   s just what you did, though.  Exactly  That   s what you did.  And you ate it that day, usually.  My dad liked to have it overnight. So, Mother would kill it, dress it, and  put it in the refrigerator in water to get some of the wild,    wild    taste out  of it. Then she   d cook it the next day. So, she   d take the one she had in  the refrigerator, cook it, and put another one in. At harvest time, it was  fried chicken every day. It   s fried in grease and man, it was good.  (Laughs) We   d haul meals down to the    I think the reason I always  thought I never liked picnics is because we   d haul meals to the field, to  harvest, when we were cutting wheat down there. When you drove in the  driveway, it had washed and it went down like that and it was very  rough. (Gestures) Mother would always spill the gravy. Back then, you  didn   t have the nice plastic containers like you have now. You had the  refrigerator dishes with the glass lids on them. Remember?  Pyrex?  Pyrex, yes. Always, invariably, she   d spill the gravy. We   d have mashed  potatoes and gravy and corn or green beans or peas, whatever from the  garden, and fried chicken. You never stopped the combine. You kept the  combine going because the wheat had to be cut. Harvest lasted a lot  longer, then, too, than what it does now. I don   t know. I just never did  really care for picnics because we ate outside all summer long, it seemed  to me like with that. (Laughter) It was a hassle to pack it up, take it  down there, bring it back home, unpack it, wash the dishes, clean up. It  was just a hassle.  Did you do it twice a day, like for lunch and dinner? Or just once?  Just once a day. And then she   d take down something in the evening, but  sandwiches or something like that. Nothing as elaborate as the noon  meal. You didn   t worry about cholesterol or anything like that because,  shoot, you worked it off  You didn   t sit at home and watch TV. You  were outside working.  You didn   t have a TV.  Yes, you didn   t have a TV. Yes, exactly.  Do you remember driving your first tractor?  16  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Yes, I do. It was a little Fordson. It had a brake and a clutch on it. If you  know what a little Fordson is, they   re kind of like a little car with a  steering wheel. They   re not a great big tractor. Anyway, I let up on the  clutch too fast and it jumped forward, and I ran into something and it  bent the very front. (Laughter) And it stayed that way until I left home  and I don   t know what happened to it. But I plowed out in the field when  the boys were in the navy. I helped my dad out in the field. We  windrowed hay and hauled hay and plowed and I hauled wheat. But by  that time, he had a self-propelled combine, and so he ran the combine  and I hauled the wheat. And we worked. All summer long we worked.  But it was, again, that   s just what you did. Until I was sixteen and didn   t  have a driver   s license, my mother hauled wheat after the boys were  gone to the navy. Shirley went in the navy and after Jack got out of high  school, he went in the navy. My dad never went to the service because  he was a farmer and a schoolteacher, and he had three children, and he  was older. But I think before the war ended, it was getting close to  where he might be called, might be called up. But fortunately, it ended,  so he didn   t have to.  What high school did you graduate from?  Cashion.  Your two brothers, too?  Yes.  And the one-room school you went to was called?  Mount Everett. Shirley went to Lincoln, didn   t he?  I don   t know.  What   s the one over across from Clifford King? Is that Lincoln?  Oh, yes, I think so. Then the one on the highway, what   s that?  Pleasant Ridge.  Pleasant Ridge.  Yes.  Are any of them still standing?  17  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  I don   t think so.  The one over on the highway across from Forman   s, what did they do  with it? Did they move that up to the museum in Kingfisher?  I don   t know, but it   s not there.  Yes, it   s not there anymore. I don   t know what happened to the one at  Mount Everett. But they   re not, as far as I know, they   re not standing.  But we used to get in the pickup, the four of us, every morning, and  drive to school, Shirley and Jack and myself. I was sitting like this  because Dad was over here driving and I was sitting like this. Of course,  the gear shift was down here and the road would be muddy and driving  like that. (Gestures) (Laughter)  Roads were always muddy.  Yes, the roads were always muddy. We   d have recess. You   d go outside  and play. There were swings, and the school rooms were heated with a  coal stove, a pot-bellied coal stove. Dad liked to keep, in the wintertime,  he would put a pot of beans on. So, you had a hot meal because back  then, too, people were so poor that a lot of times, the kids, that was the  only hot meal they had, was the school lunch. It was not provided by the  school. He paid for it out of his pocket. Granted, it was only beans, but  beans are beans. I mean, they filled them up, certainly. Or he   d have  cocoa.  And it was all grades.  Yes, all eight grades.  How many kids, students?  Well, I had three in my class in the first and second grade. I think we  had maybe twenty?  Twenty. Probably twenty.  Probably twenty in all eight grades. But you know, when I left Mount  Everett in the second grade and came up here to Cashion, I knew all my  addition, subtraction, division, multiplication tables, knew all that and  how to spell and how to write and came up here, and they didn   t know  any of that. (Laughter) So, it had its advantages. You certainly learned to  get along with a variety of people, different ages.  And your father taught all those grades?  18  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Yes, he taught all eight grades. When he came to Cashion, he eventually  was high school principal. He didn   t have any aspirations to be a  superintendent. He said he quit teaching the year I graduated because he  said the kids were getting on his nerves. (Laughter)  They really would now. (Laughter)  Yes, they really would  I   m sure he   s turned over in his grave several  times at some of the things kids do nowadays. He wouldn   t have  tolerated it at all. Back then, if kids got out of line, you spanked them. I  think some of them could still stand to be spanked. (Laughs)  So, he   d teach all day and go home and farm in the afternoon and into  the night?  You got it. When we got home, my mother had supper ready. It was  supper, it wasn   t dinner. We had supper ready and on the table. They ate,  and then he and the boys went outside and did whatever farming needed  to be done. Plowed or whatever.  Grind corn.  Grind corn, yes. Grind corn. We had a hammer mill and you ground  corn. But you didn   t go in and sit down from school and read a book or  whatever. You went outside and worked. You ate supper, you went  outside, and worked. And when it got dark, you came in. And if you had  homework, you did it. If not, you read a magazine and then you went to  bed at nine o   clock, because it was dark. You had a coal oil lamp, or  finally, you had electricity. But that was a long time coming. Of course,  that was the start of REA, Rural Electrification Administration, REA.  That wasn   t until after the war, so that was in    44. So, it would   ve been     45 or    50. We didn   t have a TV until after I graduated from high school.  So, what would you do for fun?  For fun? My dad loved to go to the movie. We went to the movie     Yes, every time it changed.     every time it changed in Kingfisher. There were two theaters, and  every time it changed in Kingfisher we went to the movie. Well, he and  Mother went to the movie. Sometimes we went and sometimes we didn   t  depending on what was playing. It was like ten or fifteen cents to go to  the movie, then, too. (Laughter)  19  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  My granddaughter was doing a thing for school. She said,    What did  you do for fun?    I said,    We didn   t have any.    (Laughter)  No, you really didn   t have time for fun. You were too busy working.  (Laughs)  And when you were the oldest, you really do.  Did you do any sewing?  Her mother taught me more about sewing after I got married. I had it in  home-ec some, but she helped me more with sewing. When I got  pregnant the first time, she helped me make baby clothes and all that.  She did.  Yes, my mother made all of our clothes.  Every time she made her a skirt, she made me one.  Where would she get her fabric?  We used feed sacks. You   ve heard a lot about feed sacks. I can  remember going to buy chicken feed and,    We don   t want that one  because there isn   t any others that go with it. Let   s see. We need this one  over here because these two sacks match.    So, you got two sacks of this  one because there was two sacks that was the same print. And my  mother baked bread. We didn   t realize how good homemade bread was.  For us, baker   s bread was a treat. Oh, my goodness. That was wonderful.  Then we found out that mother   s bread was pretty good after all.  (Laughs)  Yes, then I had to do it. I   ve done it forever, too. My grandkids say,     You need to teach us how to make bread.    I said,    You have to stop  and watch.    (Laughs)  Yes, and it takes time. Everybody is in a rush. Don   t want to take the  time to mix it up and let it set. Then go back and mix it up, let it rise, and  then bake it. But she always did that.  For every meal or just special?  Every meal. As I said, we didn   t have any baker   s bread.  It was usually biscuits for breakfast. (Laughter)  From scratch?  20  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Nykolaiszyn  Yes, scratch biscuits.  Oh, yes.  And then you came home and you had bread or cornbread for supper.  If you didn   t have fried chicken, what would you be having?  We had sauerkraut and weenies. We had     Did you butcher?  Dad really didn   t like to   he didn   t like the taste of butchered,  homegrown beef. He didn   t really like the taste of it, so we didn   t  butcher. Now, we processed hogs. We had bacon and ham, like that, but  he didn   t care for beef. So, Mother bought beef in the grocery store very  sparingly. What else did we have? Sauerkraut and weenies and fried  potatoes.  She said she cooked all of the wild game the boys shot, no matter what it  was.  Oh, yes. (Laughter) She wouldn   t clean it. That was a rule. She wouldn   t  clean it, but she   d cook it. Like fish? Never cleaned a fish that I know of.  I grew up the same way. First time J.E. went fishing, my ex-husband,  first time he went fishing and brought back three or four fish and said,     Here,    I looked at him and said,    What?    he said,    Well, clean them.    I  said,    I don   t know how, and I don   t intend to learn.    (Laughs) And I  didn   t. I have never cleaned a fish.  I have.  Don   t do it.  I did.  I   ve cleaned birds, dove and quail and squirrel. We   ve eaten squirrel.  Yes, my kids think that   s terrible. (Laughs) I said,    We ate squirrel and  frog        Oh, yes, frog legs. Oh, frog legs are yummy. They   re good.  Turtle?  21  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  No, never ate any turtle. One time, one of the boys brought home some  mussels, and Mother tried to fix those   just like eating a piece of  rubber. (Laughter) It was terrible  Never did that again.  I don   t even know what that looks like.  A mussel? They look like clams. You know, the shell?  Oh.  I don   t know what purpose they serve, but they   re here for some purpose  or other.  So, the boys went hunting, but you didn   t?  Oh, I tagged along. They went hunting mainly without me. And also,  they set traps. That was another way they got money, too. They set traps  and caught muskrat and skunk and opossum and skinned them, put them  on a board, stretched the hide, dried it. Then you took it to   there was a  fur trader in Kingfisher and one in Guthrie. I think they got better money  at the one in Guthrie. They   d take them to Guthrie and that was their  extra money, spending money. I guess that   s it.  What was bath time like back in the day?  We had a washtub, a square washtub. You put it in front of the sink  and     Whoever was last got dirty water. (Laughs)  No, everybody got clean water.  We didn   t. (Laughs)  We all got clean water, but you took a bath in the bathtub. And in the  wintertime, it was   I don   t think you took a bath every night. Now, my  dad took a bath every day. It was an unwritten rule, when he was taking  a bath, you did not go in the kitchen. You did not go in the kitchen.  (Laughter) But the rest of us   and one time   Jack was my youngest  brother   Jack was drying off in front of the stove and he bent over and  burned his butt on the stove. I mean, it just sizzled. I will never forget  that. And oh, he cried and cried and cried. Because that hurt  So, you  didn   t do that. You didn   t get too close to the stove while you were wet.  (Laughter)  You didn   t wash your hair every day like we do now.  22  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Foster  But we washed it, Mother had a big crock and we caught rainwater in it.  We washed our hair with rainwater. It was so soft afterwards. I mean,  your hair felt so soft and smooth after it was washed with rainwater.  And vinegar. Did you use vinegar?  Yes, to cut the soap.  For laundry, wringer washers?  Wringer washer. I don   t remember my mother wringing clothes out, but  I remember a washing machine that ran on gas and you had to pump it to  get it started. She used that, and it was a son-of-a-gun to get started. It  was noisy and it smoked, but I suppose she probably, when she was first  married, she     Once a week you did that.  Yes.  Mondays was the wash day.  It was wash day, yes. That   s usually when we had beans for supper  because they were put on in the morning and simmered while you were  doing the wash. Of course, you had a clothesline.  Then you used the water to mop the floors.  Yes. Waste not, want not. (Laughter)  We probably need to discuss how each one of you met your husband.  You go first.  I moved here from around the Guthrie area. I was a junior in high school  when we moved here. He was a senior. So, we, I guess, hit it off and we  were together ever since. (Laughs) Yes, because after he got out of high  school, I was a senior, and then he joined the navy. We got married  when he joined the navy. We   ve been here ever since. After his four  years in the service, we   ve been here ever since. Our three kids, they all  graduated here, too.  Did he farm?  Yes. Well, he worked for twenty-one years for a wholesale company in  23  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Oklahoma City. They were changing businesses so he quit. He was  already helping his dad farm, anyway, and so after his dad died, then he  farmed all the time.  Mostly wheat?  Yes. Wheat and oats. Oats was a one-time thing, I think. (Laughs) It  made a big crop. They   re itchy as they can be so they   re hard to work  with. So, they didn   t do that again, but cattle, had cattle, mostly.  Then when my other brother got out of the navy     He went to OSU.  Yes, he went to OSU and graduated with a degree in geology. Couldn   t  find a job. He found a job, but it didn   t pan out. He went back and he got  a teaching certificate. He went to Denver and taught school out there. He  taught school out there and then he   d come home in the summertime and  he   d farm with Shirley and his dad. So, the boys kept in it, kept in the  farming.  Didn   t dislike it that much, then.  No, they enjoyed it. Shirley liked it.  Shirley loved it. He loved it. In fact, he got the wheat sowed when he  wasn   t feeling good. Got the wheat sowed and two months later, he died.  He had pancreatic cancer. We didn   t know it. So, then we had to  combine the crop in the spring.  I met my husband   he graduated in Colleen   s class. I knew him from  then. He joined the service. He was in the army, and I went to OSU for  one year. He came back and we got married that fall. I worked in  Kingfisher until we had children. I stayed home and took care of them  and then I went to work and worked here and there. We got a divorce  and I moved to Oklahoma City and that   s it  (Laughter) I have three  children. They all three graduated from Cashion, too.  So, that   s three and three children? Six, and you mentioned  eight ?  Well, the brother, Jack, has two girls. One lives in Colorado and one  lives in Arizona. They   ve never been around the farm, really.  No. Well, they were so much younger than our kids. Jack got married  later and they were just a lot younger than our kids. Of course, they were  out there and our kids were here. They really had nothing in common  24  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  with them. Just like holidays, we   d go over to Grandma and Granddad   s,  and her kids and my kids   it was just six kids, and they all knew each  other and pretty well got along pretty good together. Colleen had a son  and two girls, and I had two boys and a girl. So, we have three boys and  three girls. (Laughs)  Worked out then, huh?  Yes.  So what   s going on with the farm, today?  We rent it out.  It   s leased.  After Shirley died, the next year we had a farm sale, sold all the  machinery. A guy that lives here, he farms all of it.  The original 160 still intact?  It   s still intact, yes.  Yes, the original 160, plus the eighty next to it. It   s all still     All still there.  Yes.  Did your family retain the mineral rights or did you sell them off?  Well, they retained them.  The other kids in his family got mineral rights down there. So, we all  share them. But where her dad built his house and all, they have all the  mineral rights. But down there, it   s shared by I don   t know how many.  We just got through leasing it and I don   t know how many others there  is, but they all got an equal share.  Did that help sustain the farm back when they first   ?  Well, I think it must have. I noticed when I was looking at the records  the other day there were several oil and gas leases on that place during  the years.  Yes, there was. There was a well or two.  25  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  There was a producing well on there that has been   when it first started,  it was quite a well. That was     This last one, you mean?  Yes. Was that before Dad died?  Down there, now?  That was after he died.  Oh, yes.  My dad died in    77.  It was even after your mother died. But it   s had a well or two on it  before. I don   t know how long they lasted, but     I don   t think they were ever very successful even though the land was  leased. I don   t think it was all that profitable. But every little bit helps.  Any major power lines going through?  No.  Some farmers have had to deal with that.  Really, the wind things, Okarche, they had a terrible time. People don   t  want it and I don   t blame them. But there   s not any high lines.  Well, there is there at the home place, where Mother and Dad lived, the  power line out there west of the house.  Yes, but I mean on this.  Oh, no. Nothing on the Foster Farm.  So the next 100 years, what do you see happening with it?  After we die, it   ll be sold.  Unless one of them has got enough money to keep it. I don   t know     I don   t know who it would be.  26  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Nykolaiszyn  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Foster  There   s only one   my grandson is the only Foster, though. I don   t  know.  My middle son, Paul, he would be the only   well, him and Steve, both,  would be the only two that even would remotely think about farming.  The other boy is a CPA  Certified Public Accountant  and he has no  desire. Paul said he would like to farm, but there is no money in it. And  there isn   t. I don   t know how farmers do it now with the cost of fertilizer  and feed and insurance.  Every time we   d go to the tax place, I   d say,    Um, no.    (Laughs)  And taxes, I mean, taxes just go up and up and up. It   s really frustrating.  Machinery is unreal.  Oh, machinery is astronomical.  And gasoline to run it.  Diesel.  Yes.  Used to, diesel was cheap, but it   s not anymore. It   s higher than  gasoline. Used to, diesel was     Was cheaper than gas.     eight or ten cents a gallon.  And then, climate. Rain, drought     Oh, yes. Farmer is the biggest gambler in the world. Really. Just like this  rain and so forth, and they talk about hail. My god, that   s the last thing  they need is hail right now. I was looking at the wheat coming out here.  It looks great. We   ve had rain, the heads have filled out, the wheat looks  good. Now, if we just don   t have any hail. Keep your fingers crossed.  As soon as the sun shines, it looks like they can jump in there     Then it rains. (Laughter)  Is it about time to harvest?  Well, May, usually the end of May they try to. But really, it would be  27  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Foster  better if it was June. But they get in a hurry.  After you   ve planted it and nursed it along, you just can   t wait to get out  there and get it.  Yes, after  Granddad Foster, my father,  died,  Grandma, my mother,   said we probably couldn   t do it. And I don   t know if we can. (Laughter)  That   s an ordeal.  It   s a lot of work. But my husband and I lived out in the country, so we  raised our kids on a farm. It was a good place to raise children as far as I  was concerned. Now, I don   t know whether it   s all that good or not.  Yes, we took our grandkids   we have six grandkids, and we took them  down to this place a lot. They had a lot of fun down there. If we were  fixing fence, we   d have a picnic and they could run up and down the  shale. They had a lot of fun down there.  Building some connection to the land.  Yes.  Yes, there   s one spot in the creek that was more of a hole, and they  could fish in it.  There is buffalo wallows down there, too.  I tell my son-in-law, he said,    That can   t be.    Well, they are.  Are there ponds on the property?  One. There   s one down there.  Natural or man-made?  Well, I don   t know if it was man-made, but it always had water. The guy  that rents it has tried to keep it up. So, I don   t know if it     Maybe naturally man-made. (Laughter) Little bit of both.  Yes, they haven   t done much to it so it must have some natural water,  there. But just the one pond.  Well, with the creek going through it     Yes, the cattle always had access to it.  28  Wickett  Foster  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  Finchum  Wickett  That presented a problem, too, because cattle would get down in there.  As the creek got deeper and deeper, cattle would get down in there and  they couldn   t get back out.  Go on somebody else   s property. (Laughter)  Because you had to have a flood gate between your place and the  neighbor   s. Every time it   d rain, go down and check and see if the flood  gate was still up. If the water was real strong, of course, you couldn   t get  in to fix it until the water went down. Invariably, your cattle got on them  or their cattle got on you. But that   s just part of it. (Laughter)  Do you have anything else you want to say before we close out?  Oh, well, I can   t think of anything else.  Do you have anything else, Julie? Well, thank you very much, then.  Oh, you   re more than welcome.  Thank you.  I hope it does some good.  -------  -------
