 Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn, also with me is Tanya Finchum. Today  is Thursday, September 22, 2011. We   re in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  interviewing Joyce and Lloyd Ellis with the Ellis Family Farm. This  interview is part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families oral  history project. Thank you for joining us today.  Wonderful to be here.  It certainly is.  There   s our farm sign we haven   t gotten up yet. (Gestures)  Well, there   s always time.  Well, I don   t know, not at our age. (Laughter)  Well, let   s learn a little bit more about the farm. Can you tell us how,  first, your family came to Oklahoma?  All right, my folks really came on the train from Illinois. They were fruit  farmers in Illinois, and my grandfather came here with five children. My  father was six months old when he arrived. After arriving here, they,  being fruit farmers, they planted fifty acres of Alberta peaches and fifty  acres of Jonathon apples. Then the remainder of the farm was in hay,  and they had horses and cattle on that. The farm, originally, was 156  acres, and it   s now down to 132 acres, because the state built a four lane  highway on two sides of the farm and took away about twelve acres.  It was 156 instead of 160 to begin with?  Yes, and that   s because it was at the end of the acreage where they make  a correction for the curvature of the earth. These 640 acre plots are  5  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  trimmed off on the west end of the property.  And we   re in Oklahoma City limits, if you can believe that. (Laughs)  Did your grandfather have any rhyme or reason when he was looking  for a good plot of land? Was there certain things he was looking for that  was special about where he settled?  Probably not. He came here and did a search and lived with some friends  for a few weeks before he brought his family down. Actually, he was not  in the Run, but bought a claim in 1891 from someone else who had  claimed it originally.  He would   ve made the Run, but his son wasn   t born yet, and the momma  couldn   t come until she had him. That   s why they were late getting here.  They probably would have made the Run, but his father was waiting to  be born. So, that made them miss the run itself, but they got a homestead  they bought.  Tell me a little bit about the property. It   s now located in what we know  as Oklahoma City. Does it have a good water source?  It has one pond on it, probably about one-and-a-half acres.  Oklahoma City ran a pipeline of water down the side of it. (Laughter)  It   s got a twenty-four-inch pipeline with fire     Five fire plugs on that side. (Laughs)  Five fire plugs on one side. When they operated it, when my grandfather  operated it, they had only one water well up near the house. It was  drilled to seventy-five feet and they got water. After we took over the  farm, we drilled another well and added to it. (Laughter) But no, there  wasn   t any unusual amount of water.  Well, they started out primarily with the apple and the peach trees     Yes.  I guess they were sticking to what they knew.  Yes, yes. They raised the same thing in Illinois, but they had much better  soil up there. (Laughs)  Yes, beautiful soil. (Laughs)  6  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  But it is surprising that they got as good of production here in Oklahoma  because we   re really not noted for growing peaches and apples here. But  that worked pretty well for probably forty or so years. But then  eventually the trees died and didn   t produce much. So, as a boy, I can  remember them taking the trees out with a steam engine and pulling the  trees out by the roots so that they could convert to wheat and oats, rather  than growing fruit. The fruit was profitable enough for several years so  that they were able to buy land in downtown Oklahoma City and build  this four-story building.  What prompted them to want to build a building?  His grandfather was obviously very entrepreneurial. He had all kinds of  ideas for this new land and what he wanted to do. While he did farming,  he also did a lot of business, too. That   s why he did that.  He was pretty well-known in the area after he arrived, and he became  the postmaster of Wheatland, Oklahoma, which is about a mile-and-a-half  from the farm. Wheatland, now, is I guess only about a five hundred  population. He also named the town of Wheatland.  He was the first postmaster.  As postmaster, he got to choose the name. There   s an Ellis Street in  Wheatland, still, but     It   s only a block long, but it   s nice. (Laughs)  But it does have the Ellis name on it. Are you acquainted with where  Wheatland is?  No.  It   s halfway between Mustang and Will Rogers Airport.  The farm is about five miles west of the airport. Now, it   s being  surrounded with great big homes.  Well, mainly there   s residencies. Of course, Wheatland   Mustang has  grown up to the farm limits now also.  So he was farming, he was serving as the postmaster, he was dabbling  with owning other property     Yes.  7  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Didn   t you say he sold four farms up in Illinois?  Yes, he        to move here.  Wow.  He was pretty well-to-do in Illinois before he came down here. When  they came down, they came on the train.  Why move to Oklahoma if things were going so   ?  Because it was new, free land.  Well, free land. Then he had five children, and so I suppose he wanted to  get land for all of them. (Laughter)  Well, in those early days, what were some of the early structures on the  farm property?  All right, there was the farmhouse. Here   s an aerial view of it, the  farmhouse. (Gestures) There was a fruit house with a cellar to store the  fruit that they grew. There was a granary that was probably built later.  But anyway, when I was a boy, the granary was there, and there was a  chicken house and a small barn.  An outhouse?  Yes.  Of course. (Laughs)  Absolutely an outhouse, plus there was also a storm shelter that was just  dug into the ground with railroad ties for walls, and it was covered over  with dirt. Very primitive storm shelter.  That farm sits on a hill so you can look around and see all these other  little towns nearby and also, you can see storms rolling in. So that   s  probably why they built the storm shelter.  Well, go into detail about the farmhouse for me. Describe it.  All right. We did show you a picture.  8  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  One story.  Single story, I believe there was only one bedroom, dining room, and a  living room.  And a kitchen.  And a porch on the west side.  Kitchen.  It was fairly decent construction. It was built out of lumberyard lumber  and nothing primitive. It had a nice porch on the west and on the east.  From the porch, you could look over and see downtown Oklahoma City,  being on a hill, that is. Other than being small for a family that large, it  was fairly nice.  It had a kitchen.  Yes, right, a kitchen. Of course, they had a woodstove for heating and  also a woodstove for the kitchen.  Two of his cousins were born out there on the farm and started life out  there.  When we took over the farm, to tell you how primitive it was when we  took it over. It, of course, had no lighting, no light, no electricity. We  added the electricity, and we added the water and gas. So, it was fairly  decent at the time, after we had taken it over.  About when was that?  That would have     Thirty-five years ago.  About in 1950. It was pretty late before we got all that. (Laughs) The  tenant was living in the house, and he had been our tenant. Now, it   s  been almost fifty years, the same tenant.  He was real young when he started, but he looks old now, like we do.  (Laughter) We thought of him as a boy.  Previously, there   d been a Czech tenant for thirty years. And both of  them were family friends.  9  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  But Grandpa, at one point, did live in the house?  Yes.  Yes.  And all five kids.  And all five kids.  And my father lived there, of course, with them.  Tell me about Grandma.  All right. She was quite   well, really, she died the day I was born.  His mother never forgave her for that. Nobody came to see the new  baby. (Laughter)  My dad had the problem of deciding whether he should go to the  hospital where his mother was dying or whether he would go to the  hospital where my mother was having me as a baby. (Laughs) I believe  he went to his mother   s     He did, he went to his mother   s funeral.  He never lived that down. (Laughter) But, of course, I never knew her.  She was a pretty good business lady and took good care of five children  and pretty well ran the household while my grandfather, evidently, ran  all the business. Later on, after he died in 1904, well then she operated  the farm until about 1917. She had her hands full and did a pretty good  job. It was during that period of time that they lost the farm. So,  everything didn   t go real well for her.  What were some of the circumstances leading up to losing the farm?  They built the building.  They put the money into this four-story building, and it was first-rate  construction. It was a concrete, steel building.  It was a pretty building.  I understand that in Oklahoma there was pretty much a depression about  1910, and they borrowed money on the farm and borrowed money on  this building and lost the building, and then the farm was foreclosed on  10  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  and put up for sale in 1917. And my father and mother had just married.  They were on their honeymoon, but they made an arrangement with a  lawyer to bid on the farm, and they gave him a fixed amount that he  could bid and told him not to go over that. But the price did go over that  figure, and the lawyer went ahead and bid the higher figure. (Laughs)  And then when my dad got back off the honeymoon, they agreed that  that was all right. (Laughs) So, that   s how the farm came to be in his  name, then.  Was your father a farmer? What did he do for a living?  He started out as a farmer, but he did graduate from college.  In  Seattle .  Then started out at a bank as a bookkeeper. Didn   t like that at all, didn   t  do well at it so he got a job with the Frisco Railway. He became a career  railway man and retired as a railway conductor. All during this time, he  did, in addition to working on the railroad, he operated the farm with my  mother. My mother was a first-grade school teacher and a pretty good  businessperson herself. She pretty much did manage the farm along with  my father.  Did they live on the farm? No, okay.  Well, my dad did originally     After they were married?     until he went to college. We would spend   we built an extra house  out there, sort of a summer house.  Cabin.  We would spend weekends out there. So, we did spend a lot of time, but  no, we actually lived in Oklahoma City. We had an apartment house,  four-unit apartment house, and my mother operated the apartment house.  She was an excellent business lady. She really was, and she really  worked on that farm. She   d go out there all by herself as an older lady,  and I   ve seen her   she had a big bull that she had on loan to freshen her  cows. She   d get out   it had a ring in its nose, it was huge. She was a  little woman. She   d grab that thing by the nose and haul it all around.  We had a collie pup we took out there one time with us. The little pup  was kind of sniffing around that bull, and the bull didn   t like that. It  started butting, and she grabbed that ole bull and ran him off. I was  11  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  scared to death  I thought,    Oh, she   ll get stomped by that thing      (Laughs) She was a small lady. But she did a lot of work with the farm.  She was the one that got the terracing put in.  She worked with the soil conservation program to have these terraces  put in. There was a lot of erosion that took place because there was a  hill. After they removed these trees, there was a lot of erosion, and she  worked with the soil conservation program to get terraces installed and  also to get native grasses planted and a pasture established. She also won  several awards that the soil conservation program presented to her.  She was really good.  And what was her name?  Frankie D. Ellis.  As a young boy, do you remember going out to the farm?  Yes, yes, being as close as we were, we almost went out there every  weekend.  Would you have chores?  Well, we would plant a garden out there. Yes, I would work in the  garden. After we married, Joyce and I went out there with my mother,  and we planted trees.  Didn   t have any trees, but now we   ve got too many. So, we overdid it.  (Laughs)  These red cedars moved in, and we just recently spent quite a bit of  money getting rid of a lot of red cedars, cutting them down.  A lot of them.  That does remind me of an early day story that my father told me. I  noticed one of your questions involved fencing. When they first arrived,  they, of course, had to put up their own fences. They used bodark trees,  posts made out of bodark trees, and we had a real wet spring. Well, those  fence posts all sprouted and turned into trees. (Laughter) My father liked  to tell that story.  There   s a cute anecdote   Henry, his father, was the youngest child in  this family of five. And evidently, the older brothers gave him a pretty  hard time, and he had a lot of freckles. They would torment him, and  12  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  they   d call him hen, because he was always laying around the house.  (Laughs) So, the father got mad at them, he told them,    Don   t tease  Henry anymore. That   s just not going to work.    They were kind of  scared of their father anyway so they   d peek around the building and go  (gestures), like freckles. (Laughter) That was a cute story.  You   ve had long-term renters on the farm     Yes.     originally with your mom and dad and then with yourself. How would  you go about finding the people who rented the land?  Well, pretty much     Word of mouth.     word of mouth. They usually always came to us. The farm had been  out there for so long, and the Ellis   s were well known there. In each  case, they came to us. In fact, that first Czech family, his name was Bill  Wasiczek, the one that stayed with us thirty years, that was through the  period when I was a boy. He and his brother came over just as teenagers  and met with my father and asked if they could rent the farm. They were  so young that my dad didn   t want to rent it to them. (Laughs) So he  refused, and so they came back with their father. And the father  guaranteed the deal so that   s the way he had started out renting to these  two teenage boys.  One of them soon married and moved away from home. The other one  stayed thirty years farming the place. This one farmer was still alive and  living in the neighborhood when Joyce and I married in 1949, and we  used to go out and visit with him. He   d always give us tomatoes or  something. Even though he was an old man by that time, we still had a  good relationship with him and enjoyed him very much. His family was  straight from Czechoslovakia, and his mother had quite a brogue.  They almost become part of your family when they   re with you for so  long.  That   s right. That   s right.  They were like family. Yes, they were real sweet people.  What did he farm?  He had an adjoining farm, and he   s the one that converted from the fruit  13  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  to grain. He had cattle and wheat and oats.  As time went on, is that kind of the same course?  Yes, pretty much.  Yes. Yes, really, that   s what they   re doing out there now. It   s hay and  about thirty acres of wheat and mainly cattle.  It   s been hard to be a farmer with no rain and the dust storms we had  back in the    30s. So, really, putting in grass and wheat and stuff was a  better process for them.  This tenant now lives in the neighborhood not far from the farm. He is a  construction superintendent. Most of his work is over at Will Rogers  Field, and so he can run his farm and have a full-time job over at Will  Rogers Airport.  Has the farm seen tough times? In the    30s, did the Depression make a  difference? Did you see any dust blow through?  Oh, my, yes. (Laughs) In the city we did.  Yes, Oklahoma City was about the edge of the dust storms. Of course, in  some of the bad storms, it even carried dust clear to the East Coast. But  yes, Oklahoma City had some bad dust storms, and so did the farm.  We had some terrible ones.  We got help on loans. I think the state had a loan for 5 percent. We   d  been paying 10 percent on the loan, and we were able to borrow money  at this lower amount. I was able to pretty well get through the  Depression days with the help that we got from state loans. I think     well, now, it doesn   t sound like any amount at all. But looking at the  records, they had loans about five thousand dollars on the farm. Of  course, in a depression and back in those years, five thousand dollars  was quite a bit. Particularly, when my dad   s highest salary when he  passed away was only three thousand dollars a year.  Three thousand?  Yes.  Those were hard times. (Laughter)  Sure.  14  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  They were.  Sure.  I can remember when I was seven. I was getting ready to take a bubble  bath. Oh, that summer was hot,    36, and it was just boiling hot  I had the  best bubble bath all ready to dive into and Mother said,    Get dressed  quick  Get dressed quick  There   s a terrible storm     When I got dressed  and we looked out the front door, the whole front north side was maroon  color, and it was coming fast. We put all kinds of towels or rags or  anything we could find around the windows, because we didn   t have all  the nice tight windows you have now. When that thing hit, you could  hardly see across the room from the dust. It was nighttime almost. Our  floors were all bare so we laid on the floor and had wet towels and  sheets over us. You could hardly breathe, and I had bronchitis really bad.  I remember it worried Mother.  It was just unreal when those storms hit. Even in the city, I know all the  pictures are out in the other end there, and they were pretty dreadful. But  it was dreadful in the city, too. It was really bad. You couldn   t stand up  if you were outside. You had to be inside. The dust just blew and blew  all over the house. I remember I was too little to help very much. I did  some, but my sister was about eight years older, and she and Mother  worked for days getting the windows washed and all that dust out. It  made a mess. We had a nice brick bungalow we lived in, but it was just  really bad. I don   t think we   ve had any storms that bad since, like that.  We   ve had a few, but not like that.  I think passed 1937 was the storms   there weren   t any real bad storms  after 1937.  No, that was about the climax of it.  Any issues with the farms when you get into the    80s or was everything  pretty okay?  Well, it was improved. About 1980, we leased the farm for oil and gas  drilling, and they drilled two wells, and they produced for ten years, or  so, and were fairly decent. It was enough to help us get our two children  through college. But by the time we got them through, it was all there  was. (Laughter)  Dried up  (Laughter)  Now, there   s been a third well drilled just in 2007. That one well is still  15  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  producing.  Not    07.  Two thousand and seven.   Nineteen  seventy. Oh, 2007.  This last well was the year 2007.  Okay. Excuse me. Got it.  That probably has helped through the years, too, with a little  supplemental income coming from the farm in addition to    I   m  assuming there   s a percentage you work out with your renters?  This last renter is on a cash basis.  Just rent.  Oh, okay.  He   s been there, what, forty-five years?  Yes.  Forty-five years.  Well, that   s good.  I noticed that one of your questions was what might follow. Well, we   ve  got a son that works in Economic Development for the city of Plano,  Texas. I think, eventually, he will be working to develop the farm. He  hopes to be able to hold onto the land and still do some development out  there.  Through the years, you mentioned your farm is in Oklahoma City, and  the city of Mustang is getting closer and closer and closer     Oh, yes.  Have you ever felt the need or have you ever been approached to  develop for residential purposes?  Once or twice.  16  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  Yes, yes, really quite often.  Is it tempting in this day and age? What keeps you from selling that  farm?  Because we love it. We really do. A lot of history there for the family.  Well, yes. And at our age, we don   t want to do that, but we know  eventually     David can do it. (Laughter)  Our son can do it. He   s   let   s see. What is he, forty-two?  Forty-four.  He   s dealing with brokers and land developers all the time. So,  eventually, he   ll be in good position to develop the farm. But we don   t  care to do it. (Laughs)  No, we told him wait until we die and then he can do anything he wants  to do out there. (Laughter)  Back in the day during your father   s time, how were records kept on the  farm? Or were records kept?  His mother kept records.  My mother was   yes, did all that.  Very efficient.  Previously, my grandmother had done that, too. But I remember my  mother keeping books and so forth. Every time they went to some kind  of a business transaction, even as a little kid, they took me along. I  remember going out to the state capitol when they got the state loans for  the farm. I was probably seven or eight, but they always took me along  so I usually knew what was going on. Maybe didn   t understand it, but at  least I was there. (Laughter)  In your grandfather   s time, the time when you all still had the orchard  running, how would you get the fruit to market?  Wagons and horses.  And where was the closest market?  17  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  The railroad     Was close, in Wheatland.     was only about three-quarters of a mile from the farm, and it had a  depot right there in Wheatland. And, yes, they had horse-drawn wagons  and took the produce to the railroad depot, and it was shipped out of     the fruit was shipped out of the depot. The stories are that some years  they had several boxcars loaded with the fruit from the farm.  How would they get the help to pick the fruit?  Probably word of mouth, I   d imagine.  Yes, neighbors. In one of those pictures there, you saw probably about  twenty or so people. Of course, there was five children and two adults in  the family     That was quite a tribe, there.  There was quite a bit of help, right there. They all worked.  Everybody needed money so it wasn   t hard to find help. That was how  they mainly did it was word of mouth. Or maybe, they might have even  posted a little notice in Wheatland or something at the post office.  Possibly.  But we don   t know that. But anyway, the word got around, and they  always had plenty of help.  And he got to name the town of Wheatland?  Yes.  Yes.  Do you know why he chose that particular   ?  He chose Ellisburg, and there was too many all over the country, so.  He offered five names, one of which was Wheatland because it was  named after most of the folks that grew wheat. He was the only one that  grew fruit. So he offered Ellisburg and Wheatland and three other names  that we don   t know. (Laughter)  18  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Ellis didn   t win out. (Laughs)  But he had   they already had an Ellisburg in New York that had been  named after     Well, they came from there, too. Before they went to Illinois, they lived  in Ellisburg.  Were the other four siblings not interested in having the land?  They didn   t have the money.  Well, they all moved off.  And they moved.  Two went to California and     The other three were women.  No, they just went into other occupations. Mainly, most of them worked  for the railroad. There was     That was good money back in those days, was working for the railroad.  He was a conductor.  Yes, three of the family worked for the railroad.  And Uncle Sherwood was an engineer, drove the train.  Yes.  So they were well-fixed. If you had a job back then with the railroad,  that was probably one of the best jobs you could get. Farming was hard,  and you ran all the risk of not making much money. That engineering  business was good. I had part of my family that was in it, too. So that  was fun.  Were Sundays a special time?  Went to church and Sunday school.  Well, one church story I can remember is my father telling about getting  them all in a wagon and going clear over to an Antioch church, which is  on the   the name of the church was Antioch. I think it was probably a  19  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Methodist church.  It was a Christian church.  Was it Christian? It was about two or three miles east of Will Rogers  Airport. So, that would make it almost a five or six mile trip just to go to  church. It was pretty difficult, but that   s what they did. They had a horse  and buggy so I guess they took a buggy.  Wheatland had a little newspaper and I used to roll it at the historical  center. His aunt was named Rella, and she was one of the five children  that lived on the farm. She was the only girl, wasn   t she?  Yes.  She took piano lessons in Edmond. Back in those days, that was a long  way away. They didn   t have all these fast transportation modes. She   d  get on the train at Wheatland and go to Edmond and take her piano  lesson and come back. They wrote it up like she   d been to Europe or  something in this little Wheatland newspaper. (Laughter) The whole  family would gather around to meet her, and her brothers would take her  in the carriage or whatever they had to the train. I thought that was the  most interesting thing, because it was just for a piano lesson, but they  wrote it up like it was a trip to Paris or some place. But that was a big  thing for that small area at the time. That was interesting that she had  that.  They had a lot of stories when we were first married. I can   t remember  all of them, but it was interesting about the five kids, how they all lived  out there. One time, the state fair was on and they were all making plans,  big plans to go to the state fair. One person was going to have to stay  and watch the farm, because they had a lot of cattle and stuff. So the  grandfather, his grandfather, rounded them all up, and they all hopped  on the wagon, and he held his one son back. And he wanted to go so  bad, and he said,    No, you have to stay here and watch the farm.    When  they returned, he was gone. They didn   t know for years where he was.  He had left and gone to California. He wasn   t going to stay on that farm  while they all went to the fair, so. (Laughs)  And he never came back, either.  Wow.  He never came back. For years they didn   t even know where he was, but  they found him. Finally, he wrote, I suppose. But he was sure angry. I  guess a lot of kids ran off from home, then. I thought that was an  20  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  interesting anecdote, that rather than stay home and mind the farm, he  took off on the train. I guess he hopped a ride on the train and left.  Was he the oldest one?  No, he wasn   t. About the middle.  Yes, kind of in the middle. In fact, off and on, I think all the boys at one  time, except my father, ran off and didn   t tell them where they were.  They came back later, all except this one. I think my grandfather was  probably a pretty tough guy, pretty hardworking himself and expected  the kids to work hard, too. Maybe they were then about like a lot of them  are right now.  Where was the closest school for them to go to?  I imagine Wheatland, wasn   t it?  Yes.  Wheatland was just down the way about a mile.  Yes, it was about a mile and a half.  Probably grades one through eight?  Probably was, yes.  Most of them were at that time.  Right after my dad got out of grade school, he went to Epworth  University here in Oklahoma City, which later became OCU. He  played     Football.     football for them. Once played against OU.  We   ve got a picture from the newspaper of that. He looks just like his  dad, just exactly. It   s right across the street from where I went to high  school, to Classen.  Yes.  Anybody ever mention anything about door-to-door salesmen or hobos  or gypsies with the train so close?  21  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  I really can   t think of any stories involving   I   m sure there were a lot of  them, but     We lived in the city and one day, Mother had been hanging clothes out  in the backyard. She came in, and she had my sister who was a baby in  that little thing she kept her in in the living room. She came in to check  on her, and here was an old gypsy lady hanging over her with some kind  of incantation. Mother didn   t know what it was and made her leave. See,  people didn   t lock their doors so the gypsy just walked in. She heard the  baby crying so she walked in. It scared Mother almost to death. She had  my sister when she was nineteen years old and had come from a very  small town up in Kansas. So, she ran her off, but it scared Mother  terribly. But the gypsies used to camp along the railroad tracks on 16th  and   what was it over there by where your house was?  Right out near Will Rogers Airport, they camped, too. Newcastle Road.  Yes, but this was Northwest Oklahoma City, off of Thirty-Sixth,  Northwest Thirty-Sixth Street, by a railroad place there. You   d see them  in camp there sometimes when we were little.  My personal experience was that a lot of produce was sold door-to-door,  and they would carry it in gallon buckets and would usually sell it in that  quantity. The clever salesman would always     Put the damaged on the bottom.  Dump his produce out so that he could show you that it was good all the  way through and not bad produce on the bottom. But I remember  tomatoes were sold that way and potatoes and so forth. People just going  door-to-door.  They came by our house with little peck sacks with them in there. Of  course, you couldn   t see what was in there and Mother didn   t drive a car.  Daddy had to pick up the groceries, because he had the car. I remember  Mother getting so angry because the top ones were picture-perfect, but  you get down to the bottom and they were all wormy and bad. (Laughs)  A bunch of little kids and I used to stand out when they   d see these guys  come along. We   d sing,    Good on the top and rotten on the bottom      (Laughter)  It seemed like they used to like to rather tell you how much money it  was in quarters or fifty cents. They   d use the term    bits,    so many    bits.     Yes, two bits, four bits, whatever.  22  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  My mother would say she didn   t deal in bits. You   d have to tell her what  it is in plain money.  You both grew up, I guess, in the city?  Yes.  Yes.  Tell me where, approximately, both of you grew up and the schools you  attended.  I grew up in the northwest part of the city, 616 Northwest Eubanks. I  went to Edgemere Grade School and Harding Junior High and Taft  Junior High and Classen High School and loved them all. I just loved  where we lived on Eubanks. That   s where I started out. It was such a  nice neighborhood. It was full of kids my age, and we used to get out  and play kick-the-can in the evening. All summer there were four of us,  or five, sat out on our front porch, had a big awning over it, and we   d  play Monopoly.  Two of the boys next door grew up in high school with Lloyd. They  knew each other. They were older than I was, and so when they started  dating, I was about ten or twelve. About twelve, and they were about  fourteen or fifteen. They had a party, and I wasn   t invited. We   d just  been always together, and I cried. I can remember crying about that. It  broke my heart. They had this big party, boy-girl party, and I didn   t get  invited. But I didn   t blame them. After I grew up and learned a little  more, I didn   t blame them. But that was interesting, because we all grew  up there together and then Lloyd went to high school with them. We  were all good friends.  Yes.  Well, where did you grow up Lloyd?  I grew up on the east side of Oklahoma City. Basically, it would have  been about a mile south of the capitol building. I was within walking  distance of downtown Oklahoma City. As I said, we lived in a four unit  apartment house. One real interesting thing was in 1928, the oil field  came to Oklahoma City and it expanded through all that area, and we  had an oil well in our backyard, in this residential neighborhood.  (Laughter) I had grade school and junior high, and the junior high is now  on the campus of OU Health and Science Center. My grade school has  been turned into one of these special     23  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  For math and science.     schools for math and science, and my high school is within four or  five blocks of downtown Oklahoma City. It   s Central High School.  Originally, it was called Oklahoma High School     Your daddy went to that.     because it was the only high school in the state at that time. (Laughs)  His father went to that one.  At night could you hear the oil well pumping?  Well, sure.  Yes, yes.  We had one right across the street where that two-story house is now.  You sure can hear them pumping. Not bad, it   s kind of a nice noise,  making money for somebody. (Laughs)  When I was a little kid, I watched them drill the well and everything. I  could look out our second-story bedroom window and see everything  that was going on over there. All the way around my grade school, and  so forth, were oil wells, and a good deal of the people in my grade  school classes had fathers working in the oil field. It was interesting  from that standpoint.  How did you two meet?  On a blind date.  My roommate in     OU.     OU was dating this girl that went to OSU that lived in the dorm with  Joyce.  They introduced us.  They got us together. I had been in the navy with this boy, and he was  my roommate down at OU when I came back and started school here.  We just dated seven months and     24  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Got married.  I was still in school, had no job     No future. (Laughter)  She had a good job working for the telephone company.  So I took care of us for five years. We lived on my salary and bought a  house. The first year we were married, we bought a house. Brand new  little tract home out way north of the city called The Village. Oh, we  thought that was the neatest thing. I   d never lived in a brand new house  and he hadn   t either. It smelled so good and fresh. We were so proud of  it. It was a tiny little house, but we loved it. We had this plowed ground  around, on the tract home, so we learned to plant grass. We had all that  plowed up stuff in the backyard so we must have put 100 packages of  seeds of all kinds of vegetables out there. We had all these rains. We   ve  been in a drought here lately, but we had rain, then. We looked out one  night and there was so much rain, the little bean plants we had were up  about that high, and they were floating all around in the backyard.  (Laughs) So, there went the vegetable garden. Nothing came up that we  could use so we planted grass back there. We put a lot of bushes and  trees out. It was nice. Lousy soil, though. It was all clay.  You   ll have to know, he   s an engineer and he thinks of these things. So,  he built these great big screens like on a screen, and we   d sit and shake it  back and forth holding each end and shake that awful soil. It sounds like  a total waste of time, but we did that and one day five little kids from  behind us came out and wanted to help us. We told them no, we didn   t  want to do that. We were having too much fun, to be honest. They  finally reeled us in and they all took charge. They did that all afternoon.  We got that whole big wide lot covered. Somebody said that would  never work, but it did. We had a fabulous garden back there.  I ran out and planted all the seeds I   d bought before we took a trip to  California, and when we came back two weeks later, all those plants  were up high, because they had all this rain. And we had a real beautiful  flower garden. I didn   t plant vegetables that time. I was disgusted with  those beans. We planted carrots and onions and beans and everything in  that first garden, and it was all floating around. So, anyway, that was  fun. It didn   t cost anything much, and we had a good time doing it. We  had a very frugal lifestyle so we got along well. Even though he was in  school, we lived very good. We didn   t have any problems with anything.  It was good. Good training for both of us, wasn   t it?  25  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  That   s right.  We grew up together. (Laughs)  What year did you graduate from OU?  In    55. I quit in my senior year when we got married, and I got a job as  an engineer, although I didn   t have a degree at that time, working for a  heating and air conditioning supply house in Bricktown. They really  trained me well. During that period of time, I took a lot of  correspondence courses to finish up. Plus, I did go back for one semester  at OU and then got my degree. Continued working for that company six  years and then worked six years in the oil and gas industry, designing oil  and gas processing equipment. Then I went to the FAA  Federal  Aviation Administration  as a senior engineer and spent twenty-nine  years there, working at Will Rogers Airport at the aeronautical center.  Not far from the farm?  No.  No, that   s right. Very close.  Just right straight through, about five miles.  We like to joke that we haven   t gone very far in life. (Laughter)  Yes, we never did go very far in life, stayed put. (Laughs)  You would have been in the navy before you went to OU?  Yes.  You went on the GI Bill?  Yes.  But it ran out when we got married.  That   s one of the reasons that I dropped out when I did. The GI Bill  expired. I was only in the navy a year and a half, and so I didn   t have  enough time to finish a full four years.  And then so you went to OSU   well, Oklahoma A M?  Yes.  26  Finchum  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  And what years were you there?   Nineteen  forty-seven and    48.  And which dorm were you in?  Willard Hall.  Do you remember your room number?  Oh, I used to. I haven   t thought about it     Or floor?  Second floor.  Second floor. What was your major?  Home economics. I loved it, too. We had wonderful teachers.  The new Library wasn   t there. You went to one of the older ones   ?  We can remember when the Library was built. Oh, golly  That was  great.  We were young marrieds, pretty young.  Yes, we used to go up there and visit.  You know how beautiful the campus is now? When I went there, there  wasn   t anything on it but manure from all the different pens. They had  cow manure and horse manure and sheep manure and chicken manure,  and it was all spread out, and that was what our campus looked like. It  rained all the time. Oh, it just rained  We all had rubber boots that came  clear up to our knees, because you couldn   t have walked in regular  shoes. It was just that bad. Oh, my goodness  It was something to go  from the city to that. I remember the first day there, we had all those  shots. They give you all those shots, typhoid and all those shots. We  came back to our room. My roommate and I had gone to high school and  junior high together. We came back to our room and we felt awful.  We   d been in long lines all day getting registered and all this done. So, I  said,    All I want to do is just lie down and take a nap,    and Adrianna  said,    Me too.    We pull back the coverlet there to lie down, and her  sister and the roommates had gotten the key to our room, and they filled  27  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  our sheets with dried soap that   they don   t even use it anymore.  Anyway, we couldn   t lie down in our beds until we did something.  (Laughs) So, we took the sheets full of soap off and put the top sheet  down and laid on it. We got up and it was still raining. We looked out  our window at Willard and here came a boy from the Farm House, and  he was chasing this great huge sow. The pig was wet. He made a flying  leap to grab it and that thing went right out, because it was all wet and  oily like pigs. He ran that whole distance, from where that library is  now, passed Willard Hall. And the last we saw, he was still running after  that pig. That pig was still jumping out of his reach.  That was a real interesting time. They were real short of space, because  most of the big buildings had not been built yet. They were using an old  building  Williams Hall  I had for English, had turrets on it and real old.  They   ve since torn that one down, which was good because it was an  old   I think it was one of the original buildings. Anyway, it wasn   t very  fancy, but oh, I just loved OSU. I always thought so much of Stillwater,  and I enjoyed that place so much. I liked the town, and I liked the city,  and I liked the dorm and the campus. I was probably one of its greatest  cheerleaders, because I loved it. I really did. I wanted to live there so  bad. But I came back home and went to work and went to work at the  telephone company. I had a real good job. I was a teller at the telephone  company, which meant I took the money. (Laughs)They wouldn   t let us  call it a cashier, because they wanted it to sound better so we called it  being a teller. (Laughs)  Any time in your early married life that you ever thought,    Let   s just  become farmers?    or no?  I would have in a heartbeat, but Lloyd was more practical. He was really  thin and scrawny. I was too, but I would have loved to have lived on the  farm. I always wanted to.  Well, we liked it enough that I spent a lot of time out there. And even  right now, we     We go out a lot.  Very few days go by that we aren   t on the farm. We go out there and     Yes, we go out a lot.  Even now?  Oh, yes. Yes.  28  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  It   s fun to go out there. We   ve got a nice pond on it. They started  building all these houses, and these city dwellers all started moving out  there. Oh, our tenant got so mad. This old lady came over one evening,  he was out working, and she told him she was turning the farm in to     what is that group? Cruelty to animals, because they didn   t have any  water to drink. He said,    Lady, what in the world are you talking about?  We have a great big farm pond out here, and they have all the water they  could ever drink,    and he said,    These animals are not up for cruelty.  They   re farm animals. They   re not pets.    He said,    I   ve been farming  out here for years.    He said,    You   re a city person so just go back and  enjoy your house and leave my farm alone     (Laughter) I didn   t blame  him. That was terrible. She was really all set to file complaints against  him. City people have a hard time moving out to the country, I   ll tell you  that. They try to turn the country into what the city was that they were  trying to escape. We   re not happy with that very much. (Laughs) It   s  right up against us.  But we   re out there at least once a month, usually much more often than  that.  What are you doing on the farm today? If you   re going out, are you   ?  We check everything.  Yes, see what his crops are doing, and we go down to the pond and     Check the water.     see if there   s ducks there and see if there   s fish, and there   s a gray  heron that has been there for years and we look for it.  Great big one.  Then we go by the gas well, and I can read the meter and see        what   s going on there.     see if the gas is improving or     Diminishing.     diminishing. Usually visit with the tenant. He may be over there  checking his cattle, and so we talk with him.  We had a tremendous number of cedars taken out this year.  29  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  These red cedars   .  Red cedars.     which have inundated Oklahoma, as you well know.  Especially outlying areas that aren   t really farmed as such.  You can see this is a map in    63. You can see there   s very few trees, but  this whole area in here was just covered in red cedars to the point that  they had covered the grassed areas    (Gestures)  The pastures.     where the native grass was. There were trees within three or four feet  of each other so they had     Covered it.  Really, there was a forty acre area there that was no longer useful for  grazing because of all these red cedars.  Did you ever see a red cedar burn?  No.  They almost explode.  They burst.  They have an oil in their needles and     They blow up. (Laughs) We put one in our fireplace on year. We had  decorated it for Christmas, and so it all dried up and Lloyd said,    Well,  we   ll just stick it in the fireplace.    It went (makes sound of fire  catching), and it almost caught our den on fire  (Laughs)  Oh, man, it just roared   Oh, it scared us to death  It was terrifying. (Laughs)  We hired a contractor to go out there this summer. He worked two  weeks, cutting these cedars and stacking them up. We understand from  soil conservation people that if a red cedar is cut off at the base, it won   t  grow up and sprout up like most trees do. You can kill them that way.  30  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  Plus, they don   t come up from the roots. They have to come up from a  seed in a bird dropping. That   s the only way they   ll come up. That   s why  there is so many of them, because birds love those little blue berries on  there.  OSU has quite a program. They   re involved in trying to diminish these  and try to control these red cedars in Oklahoma.  Yes, they are.  We had been in contact with them and gotten information from OSU in  regards to the red cedar program.  So once the no burn ban is up, you can burn the pile or what?  That   s why we didn   t have     Yes, we didn   t have them hauled off.     red cedars in years past  were not a problem  because we had these  prairie fires that burned them up.  Those are scary, those fires.  Now, we fight the fires so the red cedars can thrive. (Laughter)  Thriving, a no-win situation. (Laughs) Where are you from?  I   m from Florida.  Are you really?  Yes.  Did you grow up on a farm?  No.  Have you ever lived on a farm?  No.  What are you doing at OSU? (Laughter)  Enjoying the land grant mission. (Laughs)  31  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Oh, yes, that   s a good mission.  You   ve got a name that   s a real mouth full, your last name.  Yes, it is.  Is it Polish?  It   s Ukrainian.  Ukrainian, okay. We knew it was somewhere in there.  We were interested in that. It   s such an unusual name. That   s great.  I always like to tell people,    Yes, I   m not from around here.     You don   t sound like an Okie. (Laughs)  You can see there were a lot of Germans went to the Ukraine and  Southern Russia and then came to Oklahoma.  Sure.  Yes, we   ve got a lot of them here. You have any relatives here?  No.  Any of your family ever live here?  No.  You   re a pioneer.  Something like that. (Laughter)  Transplanted Floridian. Where are you from?  Tennessee.  Oh   Tennessee, where about?  Knoxville.  Knoxville.  32  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Oh, well great   I had a lot of my predecessors in history live in eastern Tennessee. They  had a lot of interesting things they did.  We have a lot of cedars, but not too many red.  I bet you do.  Looking towards the future of the farm, you mentioned that you   re going  to leave it up to your son. Whatever happens, happens. But if you had a  crystal ball or you had a wish for the next 100 years, don   t worry about  the economy, don   t worry about any other factors   in a 100 years and  you were still living wonderful lives   maybe they   ll find the fountain of  youth, I don   t know.  Must be a miracle. (Laughs)  What would you like to see happen to the farm in 100 years?  To be a farm. To stay a farm. I can   t bear to see it cut up, but anyway,  he   s more practical.  Well, it   s surrounded by residential property on two sides now, pretty  big developments. I   m just sure that   s the direction it will go. But our  son has done a lot of investigating, and he predicts that part of it will be  residential, maybe in the areas adjoining where the residential  development is right now, and then the rest commercial, because it does  have a four lane highway on two sides of it. So, there   s a little piece     Oh, where they put a curve in.  Yes, cut off, and that   s undoubtedly going to be a service station of some  type or a 7-Eleven     It   s a triangle shape.  A Walgreens since they build on every corner.  Yes. (Laughs) Not big enough for Walgreens. They   ve built it across the  highway, the regular farm.  There   s a little bit, twelve acres cut off that will probably go to  something. But probably residential and commercial on the two sides  that are adjoined with the four lane highway.  33  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  When the government built that road, when they approached you, what  were your initial thoughts?  We really didn   t have any choice. At first, they were going to build it  diagonal, across the middle of it. He   s a professional engineer so he  went and protested that and showed them a better way to do it, which  they did. So they just cut off a little corner of it.  Fortunately, I got with the engineer that was doing the design of the  road, and we just sat down on his design table and talked about how we  might alter his design.  And it was better than what he had.  We agreed on  the road  going down on two sides  of the farm  and  having a curve connecting  the two sections . That was acceptable to us,  and so we agreed with him. We worked it out together and he sent it  forward that way, and that   s what his supervisors accepted.  It   s really nice if you marry an engineer. It really is. If you   re dating one  at the current time, think of marrying him, because they   re real handy  fellows to have. He knows all about all kinds of stuff that we   ve used  over the years, haven   t we? (Laughter)  She   s right in the middle of everything I ever get involved in so we   re a  real partnership. (Laughter)  Yes, we are.  You mentioned you had a sister?  Yes, she   s ninety-two. She would have been here today     She had a bridge party. (Laughter)     but she was having a bridge party.  She is real active.  She said she was sorry she couldn   t come.  We weren   t invited to the bridge party. (Laughter)  If you met her, you   d never dream she is ninety-two. She   s real wiry, she  does a lot of church work at her church, and we belong to several  34  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  different groups together. She goes all the time.  And part of her education was at OSU.  OSU in home-ec.  She was a high school home-ec teacher and then later became a  counselor.  She   s lived here all her life, too.  Yes. She lives by herself, drives her own car and is very active in her  church.  We watch all the football games together, OSU and OU both. Just the  three of us have a party. We have all kinds of stuff to eat and Dr. Pepper.  We always have Dr. Pepper.  We definitely cheer for both schools.  Both schools. And we do this when OSU is doing well. (Gestures)  (Laughter)  You   re good Oklahomans.  We try.  We are loyal fans  (Laughs)  And she wasn   t interested in owning the farm herself?  She   s never liked the farm.  No.  She really never has, even as a girl. She doesn   t even like to drive out  there very much. I   ve always loved the farm and wanted to live there. I  always grew up I wanted to be on the farm. I just loved animals and  plants and things, and I always wanted to live out there. And Lloyd said  no, he never did want to. I thought it would be fun when our kids were  little to have some horses to ride and to live out there. I just always  wanted to. When it gets rain, it   s a beautiful farm. But right now, it   s not  very pretty because it all dried up. It   s a neat place. We had very special  memories of Oklahoma City. We   re proud to be Oklahomans and proud  to live in Oklahoma City even though we didn   t go far in life.  35  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  Finchum  J. Ellis  Nykolaiszyn  J. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  That   s right. (Laughter)  Where were you from?  Tennessee, Knoxville.  Oh, Knoxville. I love Tennessee. We did a lot of genealogy years ago  and drove to all these places. A lot of my family came from eastern  Tennessee, and they fought Cornwallis and drove him back to the sea.  They were all these long riflemen and rugged. But he had a lieutenant  that said they were going to come and kill all those people and their  wives and children and burn down all their towns. And these old guys in  Tennessee weren   t going to have that so they all mustered around and  drove the general with all his wonderful British troops clear back to the  Atlantic Ocean. He said,    Those are the only Americans I admire,    he  said,    They are savage fighters.    So, he was one of those. (Laughter)  How many kids do you have? Two kids?  Yes, a boy and a girl. Had our daughter in 1960 and our son in 1960     was it seven or eight?    68.  Have they spent any time on the farm?  Our son likes to go out there.  Yes, he goes out there.  As a teenager, he did a lot of hunting on the farm.  Yes, he went hunting out there.  Right now, he   s deeply involved in planning the future of the farm.  He loves the farm.  So does his wife. She   s very interested in it also.  Can you still see the city from the top of the hill?  Yes.  Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  36  Finchum  L. Ellis  J. Ellis  L. Ellis  J.
