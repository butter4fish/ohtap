 Finchum  Ninness  Today is May 11, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re doing an oral history  project focusing on Oklahoma Centennial Farms. Today, I   m in Stroud   Oklahoma  with Hortense Royer Ninness.  And really I   m from Stroud. He   s  her son, Romeyn  from Davenport  and we   re southeast of Stroud  and southwest of Davenport . This has  always been a rural route for U.S. mail to Stroud. He   s from Davenport  but I   m just in between, southeast and southwest.  Well, thank you for having us today.  Thank you. I appreciate doing this.  Let   s get started with you telling us when you were born and where.  I was born in that house  built by the government for the Chief of the  Sac and Fox prior to the 1889 Land Run  over there that burned down in  2002. And Romeyn was born there too; the only one of my kids that  was. But all of us children were born there. My grandfather came here  and homesteaded so they lived in that house. My father married Mama  when he was 18 so we   ve all been born there. Then we   re buried at the  Stroud cemetery.   My daddy told me one day that my mother lived on the farm across the  road from our house and farm. She had two brothers about my dad   s age  and Daddy was a hunter. That is the way he made a living for he and his  mother, after his father died. He got acquainted with Uncle Dalton and  Uncle Birney Dee Herrin. They would go hunting together. Every family  lived on wild game for their food supply then. Game was plentiful.  Through them he met their older sister, Cora Lee Herrin. They began  courting and were married May 1907, Mama said in the new courthouse.  Stroud then was about three blocks wide.   5  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  And when were you born?  July the 23rd, 1912. I got the Oldest Person present at Davenport  yesterday. They did Davenport Days Saturday.  Nettie Davenport, the  first post-mistress of Davenport, wrote to the U.S. Post Office and  received permission to establish the first post office and named it  Davenport. They have the    Nettie Davenport Days  the last Saturday  before Mother   s Day. It is also homecoming for alumni.   Well, that   s cool.  A little gold statue. I   ve got a whole string of them up there. My  husband and I would get the Longest Married Person and he   d get the  Oldest Person for several years, but I didn   t take him when he was 100     cause he didn   t feel too good. I wouldn   t make him sit in the car all day.  Well what can you tell us about the time when your parents came to this  area?  Mom and her family were from Rolla, Missouri and she came with her  family when she was oh maybe 8 or 9 or something. Her baby sister was  born about 4 miles straight north of here on the Fishburn farms. But she  was born at Rolla, Missouri. Then her father was a cowboy through  Texas all of his young life and he loved Texas. He went back and  married her mother and then he raised his family and stuff. He kept  wanting to go to Texas all the time and finally she gave in to leave  Missouri and go to Texas with him. I   m sure it was down about the Rio  Grande where it   s beautiful. But she said   Mama told me this, the  further west she got out of Missouri into Oklahoma, the more desolate  the country became. No trees, nothing green, no pretty water running  across the rocks all clear and stuff. She was so disappointed and she had  an older sister that married a Galloway  James Warren Galloway  at  Stroud and they lived at Stroud, so she said,    I   m going as far as Stroud  then I   m not going a step further.    So we   re still here.  Then my daddy   s daddy was a   my father was born at Winfield,  Kansas, it   s close to Newton. His daddy was sent here by the United  States Government to put out fruit trees for the Indians. This house over  here was built by the government for the Chief when this was Indian  Territory when they moved the Indians to the Sac and Fox   Reservation . I guess my grandfather must   ve been a horticulturist or  something    cause he sure knew a lot about fruit trees and things. He  must   ve put his application or saw an ad or something. I don   t know just  how he got here, but that   s how he came. The government sent him here.  They put the fruit trees out and this whole southwest corner was fruit  trees. When I was little there was one tree left that came clear up close to  6  the road and fence was right here, and there was a tree just on the other  side of this shed. It was an apricot tree. We had a storm one time, blew it  over to the south, and my sister and I could climb up it when we were  little and get the apricots off of it. That   s the last tree I remember.  But when the Chief   they built this home for him, and I had his family  come by, the children   s family come by one time and they did not know  whether the boys was born to the first wife or second wife. But I was  thinking the other day, all they have to do is find out when she died and  when the kids was born and they   d as soon know whether it be a white  woman or an Indian woman. When his wife died here, he went back to  the Sac and Fox Agency and opened him up a store, mercantile I guess,  because that   s what every store had in it in those days. When my  grandfather got the fruit trees put out, then he took a job with his team  and wagons. It   s called a dray wagon and they go to Guthrie and haul  supplies back to the Sac and Fox; it took about a week for him to make  that trip.  They drove across country and around hills and forded rivers  where rocks had been placed for crossing.  Well, after this Indian  woman died, the house was sitting empty. Nobody lived in it. Indians  always burn their teepee and everything and they moved when anyone  dies to keep diseases down. They   re smarter than we are. Anyway, he  went down there and this house set empty. Well, by then my grandfather  just rented whatever was around this part of the world.  I don   t know when the Frisco railroad went through, but the oldest boy  was 20 years older than my daddy and he helped. He was a foreman on  the Frisco train that went from Stroud through to Davenport and  Chandler. So if you can know what year that was, his second brother  died because they stopped that handcar at the road and he fell over and  broke his neck. This little town over here two miles west and three south  was called Clematis. I did not know it was a town all my life until Don   Sporleder  had a tour here a while back on it and took us over there and  they told us about it. Because my grandmother always said he was  buried over at Clematis Cemetery. I always thought of it as Clematis  Cemetery, I didn   t think about a town being called Clematis. But  originally the town was called Clematis and they call the cemetery  Victor now. Don explained to us that day that a man came from Victor,  Kansas and he had a homestead over there, and bought a farm  when  others sold and went west , a house, or something at the town of  Clematis and his little daughter died. He renamed the cemetery Victor  after where they came from Kansas I guess, where she was born or  something. So that   s why it   s called Victor instead of Clematis.  My grandfather then took a job after, during the trees and things all set  out and things, so he wanted to drive a dray wagon from Guthrie to the  Sac and Fox and get supplies. In between the time that this boy died  his  7  son Martin  and then, this house was setting empty. My grandfather told  the Indian man,    If you aren   t going to live in that house, why don   t you  let me move my family in there?    So he said,    You can have it. You can  have the house and all the land around it.    So he gave it to him and I  don   t know how many years  it was  from the time his wife died to the  time my grandfather moved in there. But my daddy was nine when his  father died, so it   s sometime between the time he was born and then,  nine years, that the wife died and they moved in there.  When they put the railroad through, Daddy showed me over west of  the  cemetery of Davenport, toward Chandler, on Highway 66  down in the  hollow about a half a mile and you go downhill from Davenport to the  housing. That   s where the Frisco railroad had houses that they let their  employees live in. Daddy said there were three on the north side of the  railroad track. And it   s in the area where Tippins   s own land on the  north side of 66. This was on the south side between 66 and the railroad  track. They lived there, Daddy told me, and he went to school when  Davenport school was up where the cemetery is. That was the first  school Davenport had, way back yonder. Grandpa moved his family into  this house so we   ve been here all these years.  When Daddy was 9, his father had went to Guthrie and got a load of  supplies, and they bought everything in barrels and stuff then, and took  them to the Sac and Fox. By the way, I can remember when my sister  and I would lay upstairs in the bed and Grandma Royer had big square,  they was at least this big, of wallpaper patterns. He   d bring wallpaper  books from Guthrie down, and I did work for a lady in Stroud that her  daddy  Mr. Lawson  had built the houses for the people in the Sac and  Fox, individual homes. They   d wallpaper their houses. Well, wallpaper  companies change the book every year and he   d give them to Grandma  and she wallpapered the ceiling in the brick house. We   d lay there  in  our bed  and pick out the one we liked the best, the prettiest. I had a blue  one that I liked.  And so he brought all them supplies down and he   d gone to Guthrie and  got a load of supplies and he ate his breakfast and left to come back. It  took about a week, I think, for him to get here from back and forth for  the trip, from Guthrie back. In those days when you went across country,  you didn   t have section lines or roads, it was just out across the country   It was still Indian Territory . They went around through the hills; over  here by homesteaders was Betty Waters    daddy, Archie Oliver. Oliver   s  farm where he homesteaded the foothills and the river. He went on  toward Davenport and on across the country. So he left Guthrie, started  back with his supplies that morning, and he said he got about halfway  home when he began to get sick. He thought,    Well it   s as close to the  Sac and Fox to a doctor as it would be to go back to Guthrie for a  8  doctor.    So he said,    I   ll just go on and empty my supplies and go back  home.    Mama told me that in three days he was dead. They never did  know what killed him, but over the years Mama had learned about  ptomaine poisoning and so she decided that   s what he died of because he  ate just before he left and he got sick on the way. So she said it must  have been ptomaine poisoning that he died from. So he   s buried over  there. He   d be the second family member in the Clematis Cemetery.   Hortense, in written correspondence, shared that when her grandfather  died, the Chief of the Sac and Fox Agency gave her grandmother a job  cooking for the Sac and Fox school and she may have held this position  until the agency was disbanded. She recalls walking through the old  school while courting her husband and describes a huge dining room  with stairs going up to the dormitory. She further describes part of the  reservation stating a sidewalk went from the north end of the reservation  to the south end where the jail was located.   I was 13 when my grandmother died. She had    rheumatism    a lot worse  than I do. Rheumatism, that   s what they called it in those days. My  neighbor, Laura  Johnson , says,    Hortense, there   s no such a thing as  rheumatism.    But you know what I   m talking about. We have inherited a  little bit of it down through the family. But she was pitiful, it was  terrible. She sat in a chair and Mama would lift her in and out of the bed  and all that stuff    til she died. I can remember, it was my responsibility  to take care of Grandma when   my sister   s two years younger than I,  and if we were out in the yard playing , Mama would be in the garden  picking the peas and all that garden stuff, pulling weeds and things, my  job was to take care of Grandma. If she called and wanted a drink of  water and I didn   t go in and give it to her, I got a spanking when she  come in and Grandma told her I didn   t, she called and called and called  and I didn   t come. I was so attached to her I guess, and I can remember  standing in the front door, and the women was all around Grandma in  the corner of the bed over there.   Aa doctor made a home visit and laid my grandmother on the kitchen to  give her    exercise.    The doctor    cracked    her bones in an effort to  straighten out her legs and arms. The doctor also suggested that she take  Bayer Aspirin, which has just been invented. My grandmother refused  because she did not want to become addicted .  By the way, that bed, part of it is out there, we got the other half stolen.  Mama told me that her father gave that to her for a wedding present.  Preacher  John  Howard  neighbors from Kentucky  told me that in  those days they gave the family a team of mules and a bedstead and that  was the wedding presents for to help them start married life together. So  that bed was still in Mama   s house and that was the one he  Romeyn   9  was born on too. They were all around Grandma and I heard somebody  say she had died. God I guess it shocked me so that they said I went out  that front door like a bullet and I ran down the road and I ran a half a  mile to where my daddy was. There was an oil well being drilled down  on Grandpa Hopper   s farm and Mama and them said,    There ain   t no  way catching that girl, she   s gone.    I can remember running that far and  them talking about that when Grandma died.  They are no headstones in  marking her grandmother   s grave .  And then here it  question guide  says something about a log barn and a  log building. Telling about the barn, I played in it a million times, but I  did not remember it as I grew up and left here about it being a log barn  until there was a preacher from the Methodist Church in Chandler. He  studied the Five Civilized Tribes  as a hobby  and he   d write to  Washington, D.C. and get maps and patterns and everything about the  history, and he came over here with a map that had my brick house on it  and another house. He said,    There were two houses here in 1860.    And  that was what his map was. I said,    I can   t remember a building down  there.    We talked about it and later on I finally remembered that was a  log barn. My reason  for  why I couldn   t remember it as a barn, was  because we grew up calling it a corn crib because Daddy had put tin all  the way around the barn and when the corn crop came in he   d put the  corn in there for the horses and stuff. Then, he built his barn on further  south where the roof that goes up high and then down and in the middle  of it there he had three big gold poles out of trees in the woods and  would put a wooden extension thing and feedbox for the horses and they  were tied up just south of the log barn. On the other side of it, he kept  hay stored  they would hunt for hen eggs on the hay, too  and we kept a  cow on that side. I can remember that   s what the log barn looked like  when I was growing up after I was a young kid. My sister and I, we   d all  climb up on that tin barn and run down and jump off on the ground. All  the kids played around the barn and buildings, climbing on all of them.  Later I have a friend that her daddy lived ten miles south of Davenport  Cemetery, and one day I was going down there to visit. I   m always  driving around on the road somewhere just to see what the country looks  like, like my daddy always did. I drove about four or five miles south of  the Davenport cemetery and then I went a couple miles west and there  was a log barn standing just exactly like it. The house I thought I took  pictures of it and things but I don   t know if it   s still there now or not,  because that hasn   t been too many years ago so it may still be standing. I  don   t know whether it would be a barn or a house because they built two  rooms and then had a walkway between the two. The door to the barn  was on the inside under the roof, where you opened up and put your  harness and stuff in it from the horses. Because I can remember that  much of it of how the log barn was built.  10     Farm house and how it changed over the years     from the question  guide . Well, they built this and (laughs) I remember growing up and I  like flowers, flower bed work and stuff and then Mama said,    Quit  digging them rocks out of there, you   ll make the house fall down  That   s  the foundation of the house.    One time my son took a trip in high school  down to eastern Oklahoma and he came back telling about a house an  old man had started that was partly built. The houses were built with a  rock foundation and were wide at the bottom and they came up at an  angle to meet what you put the house on. This brick house was built like  that. It was four rooms, two rooms down and two up. They were at least  16 feet wide or wider, at one time I knew but I don   t anymore. I wrote it  in the Historical Society, Chandler   s got it at one time. In between the  north room and the south room is a big hallway. Those steps have 16  steps up, I remember them as well as I counted them every day and  every night. They were made out of  solid walnut , Daddy said,    See,  these are sanded, they   re cleaned off.    You saw the circle of the saw  where it sawed out the boards that they was made out of  6    wide x 1    ,  but we walked along them and polished them so many times they shined  like a piece of varnished furniture.  Then upstairs was not a full story high. It went up about six feet on each  side, and then the roof. So Mama called it a story and a half, but it  looked like a two story building. There was four windows in the south  end and four in the north end and two on each side in the east side and  none on the west side except downstairs. They didn   t windows on the  west upstairs  There were two half windows upstairs on the east side.  There were transom windows above the front and back doors . But they  had them downstairs, two on the west. Then above each doorway of the   hallway  upstairs was a  transom window that opened with a rod .  There was not one on a window in the west but there was on the east. A  window upstairs, a half window that went from the roof down to the  floor area.  Y   all might help me on this, I   ve been thinking, I   ve been reading, that  Indians have built a museum in Oklahoma City, and I   ve been thinking  there   s too much beautiful stuff over here to go to waste. I   d love to see  and I   m even planning on writing the Governor or somebody about it to  take those bricks, they   re made out of sand and they do break so you  have to handle them carefully, but there   s a lot of whole bricks over  there and a lot of them broke as they fell. But they would make beautiful  benches or seats or a wall around the building or something.  Then the windows, and there   s one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,  eight, nine at least windows, no, nine, ten, eleven, nearly twelve  windows that were made with a rock ledge. A hand-hewn rock ledge  about 12 or 14 inches wide and the length of the full window. Those  11  Finchum  Ninness  were big windows in those days. They weren   t the size these are. And  that rock was put on top of the foundation of the house when they bring  the brick up so high and then they put this, it   s at least six or eight inches  thick and it   s at least three or four feet long and it   s about a foot or more  wide. Then they put a wooden wall   that house had all solid walnut in  it, too. Every board and stair step and everything   s made out of solid  walnut. The two by sixes that the stairway was built out of was all solid  walnut. There was a walnut board laid on top of that rock window ledge.  And they   re still over there. I   d like to see somebody, they could lay  them on top of the seats, they   d make beautiful seats around that Indian  museum. It is the Sac and Fox stuff. I   d love to see, so maybe you can  talk to somebody and maybe tell them about it and get them to come out  here and     We   ll see what we can do.     save the brick and stuff because I   d hate to bulldoze it off and see it  carried out and put in a ditch somewhere and that   d be the end of it.  I kind of want to tell you about what I can remember. My sister has the  picture of my father and mother. I   ve been telling her when she finds it,  to send it back to me. My daddy had bought a Kodak camera. They   re  big old foot square cameras with glass plates that went in them to take  pictures and he had one of those, so I guess that   s what he took it with.  When they married and lived here, there were a lot of ditches in the farm  because it was farmed with cotton and stuff like that. In those days. You  went up and down, you made a straight row, you didn   t make crooked  rows, they had to be perfect. You could stand at one end and see clear at  the other end of the field a straight row and that was being a proud  farmer.  Evidently over the years, the water had washed and maybe it was  natural   I know it was natural, a lot of it was, because Daddy told about  the people that lived south, wagons and teams, it   s hard for them to go  up the hill and everything. He said this corner over here is at least 16  feet of dirt on top of it now. It was that much lower when he was a kid  growing up. There was a grocery store and buildings at that corner and  one time I guess it was a grocery store at that corner on that side. He said  that was at least 16 feet lower. There   s that much dirt washed in there  and so this hill up here would   ve washed down, so it would   ve been  higher and all this. My daddy opened a gate down here  in the southeast  corner of the farm  and he let the farmers that lived south, everybody  they came right through this farm and went up by the fence row of the  farm and out back west a little ways then straight north and come out on  top of the hill. The team could pull the wagon easier than going down  this hill and up that hill there. So that   s the way the land was.  12  In front of the house, going down, just about maybe        How far would it  be to that first pecan tree, Romeyn, from the mail box up?    Quick as you  go down my driveway and you got to the mailbox, well then when you  start north, that   s where the ditch is and  there are  big pecan trees there.  This ice storm we had in  the winter of  2002 took a huge pecan tree  down and I guess its roots was on the rocks, the reason why it didn   t stay  up too good. But we lost two down there in that ice storm. They were  old trees, I   m sure.  But Daddy and Mama hauled rock, they went down a half a mile and  then two miles west. Mama said a mile across there the way the crow  flies and she grew up with that girl. She married a man and that was his  home over there. They hauled rock from that hill, that   s a real rock hill.  That   s where the deer farm is now, Davenport   s deer farm. It   s a solid  rock hill, all that over there is rock. They hauled rock from there and  filled this ditch up down here, rip-rapped them across from one area to  the other and then they took a picture of them standing in front of it and  they held their hands up and it didn   t even touch the top of the rock.  Now that   s how deep that ditch was that they hauled rock and put in  there. So that   s the lay of the land.  And my uncle, Daddy   s oldest brother, he went on west and he ended up  in Oregon. He came back one time and visited as an old man and he told  me that north of this house was solid timbers. They had cleared all that  off. Don  Sporleder  said over at the Creek County line that there wasn   t  any trees at all and now they   re all solid cedars over there. He said in  those days it was prairie and there wasn   t any trees anywhere around.  But Uncle Lou told me they had to clear all that  area, north of the  Chief   s home, of trees to farm  and I imagine they cleared this for the  fruit orchard, too.  I got to tell you a cute little story. The Indians would camp around here  all the time. They brought their teepees, when I was a kid growing up,  and they   d camp. Daddy always let them camp wherever they wanted to.  This is solid willows back here  west of the farm  from the river around.  He said the Indian Chief would send the    big bucks    down here and they  would go down and cut the willow trees and strip the bark and that   s  what they made their teepees out of when they had their pow-wow down  at the Sac and Fox when I was a kid. The women would come up here  when a baby was going to be born and they   d camp all around. My  grandma said there was a little young girl had her baby and she jumped  up and took off down to the creek to take a bath and Grandma said,     Don   t do that, you   ll kill yourself, you   ll take pneumonia     She would  go take a bath after she had given birth to a baby. That   s the custom they  did I guess, take a bath and clean up and stuff. Just a hop and a jump  down to the river.  13  Daddy   s mother brought her loom with her from Kansas when she came,  for weaving rugs, and Mama said she had it set up in the north room  upstairs and she said,    She had a loom big enough to almost cover the  whole floor, and that   s how big of a carpet she could weave.    She   d put  out a black walnut tree down there at the edge of the fence row between  our land and the neighbor   s. It   s still standing there, a black walnut tree,  and she did that to get brown dye for her to dye her rags. I took Daddy  up to Pawnee one time, I   ve been up there twice to the museum, and I  took him one trip. He went around looking through there and he found a  bucket and a crank on it and he said,    Boy I   ve stomped many a rag in a  bucket like that for my mother and twisted that handle and twisted the  rags for her to put through her loom to weave her carpets with.    Then  she told me she would save onion skins to make the yellow dye. That  and the blue flower, it   s called indigo flower, they got the blue I guess  out of. Those are about the only things I remember her telling about her  dye.   Grandmother used a copper or brass kettle to boil her clothes in and to  make colored dye rags. She also used it to make applesauce along with  the aid of a wide, thin long handled board. We had a large apple orchard.  A stirring spade was also used the day you were making apple butter.  You   d need to stir it every so often, in that big brass kettle, over a hot  fire all day to cook it down to a good think buttery consistency. Then  you   d pour the butter into a tall gallon crock and store it in a cool cellar  with several thicknesses of a dish cloth type towel tied snugly over it and  a board placed on top to keep it covered. Yum, Yum  Good on hot  buttered biscuits.   Then one year she decided she wanted to go out west, it was Cheyenne,  Wyoming then, where her oldest son was and she was homesick for  them. One year we all went out there and stayed I think two years. Then  he went on, he ended up in Oregon and he liked to mine. He would dig  mines and sold uranium to the government during World War II out of  his mine. Then Daddy and Mama separated and they went out, Daddy  went out there   they went to California during the Depression because  nobody had a job here and you couldn   t make any money or anything.  They said,    Why did you get married in 1930?    I said,    I was in love.    It  didn   t matter to me if the Depression was on. But we lived the first of  our married life through the Depression. It wasn   t really good. Now we  got one, really I think it is worse than the one we had then. But then we  had dust blowing during that time, we had the Dust Bowl. Because they  farmed the fields up north you know, just straight rows, and plowed and  plowed and they cut all the trees down and the wind came and it blew.  The day my brother   s oldest girl died we drove from Asher  Oklahoma   up here in a dust storm. You couldn   t hardly see the highway, the dust  storm was so bad. Then it was Highway 18 going to Shawnee and it was  14  Finchum  Ninness  a dirt road; wasn   t no gravel or pavement on it when that happened.  Long time ago stuff.  So when you got married you lived here on this land?  Yeah we got   my husband   s from Illinois. His cousin lived two miles  north of here. All his family had died and he was the only one left, so he  decided he wanted to go back to Illinois to meet his mother   s people.  Now, my husband  Clarence  was born here at Stroud a hundred and one  years, soon, ago. Stroud I don   t imagine was only down at the railroad  track, just a little bitty place. My daddy could remember moving the  buildings from old Stroud down to the new Stroud because the railroad  came through and put the depot on the low-level part. So the man that  homesteaded that acreage, he made a town out of it and it   s called  Stroud after him. They moved all the houses and buildings down to this  low-level down by the railroad and the depot. Daddy was like eight or  nine or somewhere after five years old anyway. He said they put logs  underneath the buildings and then would roll or pull the building and  then the log that would come out from behind they took it and put it in  front and rolled it again. That   s the way they moved the buildings from  up on the hill down to the valley.  I know Stroud couldn   t have been more than a block or two wide when  my husband was born  in 1907 , which would be about a mile north of  Stroud, now Stroud   s passed it. It was called Little River, no I   m sorry,  Little River   s now Seminole   it was called Salt Creek at Stroud. It   s  right at the edge of town, right out where the old Tanger Mall was.  Stroud goes clear up to the turnpike overpass and further on now. But  his family came out here because this boy I went with, a Chapman boy,  his mother and Clarence   s mother were sisters. He ran a jewelry store  and a saloon in Stroud. He   d bought this farm or got a hold of it from  somebody, pioneers that went on west I guess. He needed somebody to  farm, to take care of his farm. He had Clarence   s mama and his wife   s  sister and family to come out here to run the farm. That   s how come he   Clarence  was born in Oklahoma. They stayed here several years    til  let   s see, about three kids were born here I guess. His  Clarence   s   brother lived in Shawnee. His niece is a nurse in Dallas, Texas now and  she didn   t know anything about her daddy so I   m going to take her one  of these days  and show her the log cabin where they lived when he was  born, one mile east of the old Terry farm . His mother came out and  visited us awhile, his mother and dad and them, and when we went from  here to Davenport she showed me, she said O.D.  named after O.D.  Grooms, a Davenport banker. He said he would put an account for the  baby is she   d name him after him. So they called him O.D.  was born  one mile east of Davenport. And so I have seen it and it   s a log house.  15  We visited one of Clarence   s cousins back in Illinois there, he had spent  20 years in the service and then retired  in Marion, Illinois , but we went  and visited his daddy, and Clarence   s dad   s brother all the time. Marion,  Illinois was real close to where his daddy and them settled, and so I said  let   s go down and visit him. His daddy had just died and he had a whole  box full of pictures. He said,    Take all of them with you back to  Oklahoma if you want to, I don   t know a soul in them boxes.    I wish  now we   d brought them all because my husband knew a lot of them and  I did too because I   d been married to the family so long. He picked out a  lot of pictures and brought them home that day. There was a house, a log  house, and Clarence   s mother and daddy were standing in front of it and  he   s  Clarence  about five years old. The little boy  O.D. Ninness  that  was born when they lived there was about 18 months or something, he  was playing in the dirt. Clarence could never remember that log house.  But since his mother was here and told me that   s where he  O.D.  was  born, I drove down   I   m always prowling around to see what   s in the  country   and I drove down that road one day and went in there and  there was that log house. They had a new frame house on the hill a little  west of it, but that   s the house, that   s where that picture was made. But  when we wrote everything on the back of it, he thought it was  somewhere in Illinois where they   d sharecropped, he couldn   t remember  where it was. But I do know now, and that little log house is still  standing over there. They have tin around it and stuff, but it   s still there.  Little old two room thing, just like all of them were built, I guess.   That   s where they lived with O.D. was born .  This cousin of his that lived north here decided he   d go back to Illinois  and visit his mother   s family  his mother is from Norris City, Illinois .  So my husband was working up north   he always farmed, sharecrop  farming or worked for a farmer. His parents, in those days the kids all  had to help make a living. They   d put little kids out with uncles or aunts  or somebody to help make a living. So she had a brother that lived where  she was born and raised. Clarence went over there when he said he was  five years old he started taking care of working for Uncle Irvin   English . From there on he went on north to Illinois as he grew up  working on farms. He ended up in Tonica, Illinois. And that   s who I  named him  her son  after, Romeyn Ford, that he  Clarence  worked for.  I had a time naming him; every name I called, nobody liked.    I don   t  like that, I don   t like that.    One day I remembered about Romeyn Ford  and I said, next morning I woke up, I said,    I   ve got his name and  nobody   s going to change it. His name is Romeyn.       Oh, I like that. I  like that, it   s pretty.    So that   s what his name comes from.  It was Christmas time. So Clarence came from Ford   s for Christmas to  be with his folks  at Carmi, Illinois . This boy was out there visiting his  mother   s people and Seminole was just booming. Oil field days. Tulsa  16  then Drumright then Cushing and all around Seminole, Bowlegs. All  them was boom towns. Seminole was just starting. So his cousin said,     Why don   t you go back to Oklahoma with me? You can get a good job  in the oil fields.    They just said you can get a job. He decided he   d come  to Oklahoma with him. He lived up here on the farm on US 66, the  original Highway 66, was on the Ozark Trail and it came a mile west of  Stroud, a mile south of Stroud, a mile of west of Stroud, and then a mile  south, and that   s that marker that   s up there, that white marker  a square  cement, original road mileage sign . If y   all go north of here, you   ll see  it. Then it went just west  of the Soward farm  on the south side of US  Highway 66. I was in high school when they cut it across  and took off  all the section mile turns . And so we came   his cousin had a farm right  there one mile, half a mile north of that pyramid. In those days you had  to have a filling station every place on the corner for people travelling  going to California and stuff, so his cousin put a filling station on the  corner where  the monument marker is . It came south and then went  west  there .  That pyramid, I can   t remember when that was built, but it must   ve been  when I was between 13 and, somewhere in that age I guess, 11, maybe  14 or 15, when Rural Electric from Stillwater was going to put Rural  Electric all through the farms and they came out here and my daddy paid   35 for this farm to have electricity. Now I wasn   t married, I was still a  little kid at home. They never did get electricity, it seems like something  happened to the money and then it never was built. It was, what, about 4  or 5 years, Romeyn, after we came back here before we got electricity?  It was 1951. Well, we had water from the well, windmill, and all that  kind of stuff for the house. That tank out there was full of water and we  had it running through the house, had water in the house like people in  the town and everything. But as I grew up I thought,    When I get  married, I   m going to live in town. I don   t want to live in the country  where you have to carry water and all that junk.    But by the time I came  back here, I didn   t mind living on the farm because we had electricity  not long after I was here. So I didn   t mind that.  But Clarence came back here and that filling station  his cousin built on  his farm  on the corner then was the original 66 highway. I can  remember when they built that white monument up there. Up at the top,  if you notice, there   s a square hole on each side. They was going to put  electric light to shine down and they painted how many miles it was to  town and an arrow telling you which way to go. This  road in front of  our house  was the Highway 49 when I was a kid growing up and it went  right on south to Seminole. The bridge that   s 3 miles south of here over  Deep Fork, you can   t even find it, it   s under water now, that we went  across in those days. And Brown   s  Keturah Brown  got pictures of her  kids on that bridge, but she says there   s nothing there now, you can   t  17  even see it. That   s how much dirt   s washed in and the water is filled in  and how much the earth is. The Bible says the high places be made low  and the low places be made high. So they really are, if you just know the  history of any place.  So this kid, that pyramid was put there, and the filling station on the  corner and a road sign to tell you. I can only remember one on the west  part. I can remember Tulsa 60 miles and Oklahoma City 60 miles, and  the arrow pointed when you came from the west that way from Tulsa  and the other way from Seminole coming to Tulsa and going to  Oklahoma City went that way, an arrow said 60 miles. There   s only two  I can remember. But there was one out at where the Oklahoma border  line is. I can   t remember the name of it. Been trying to think of it the last  two or three days, it had that mileage and I can kind of remember it, how  far it was from here to the end of Oklahoma. And then Los Angeles,  everybody was heading to Los Angeles,  California     during the Great  Depression days I lost so many of my childhood friends to the Dust  Bowl Depression days . So all those names was on and then Seminole as  you went this way it pointed straight on to the right.  This cousin came out and of course I was going to high school then   oh,  by the way, the  country  school was a half a mile south of me. Back  when I was about maybe 15, my sister   s two years younger than I am  and then my brother   s eleven months older than I am. I can remember  they closed the country schools. The school superintendent wouldn   t pay  for teachers anymore because all the farm people, sharecroppers, had  moved away and there wasn   t enough children in a country school, they  begin to close them down. My school was closed down early, among the  first ones I guess. We had to go to Stroud to the grade school to finish  school. I think I started in the 7th grade and then in the 8th grade I  graduated. Then you graduated out of 8th, and then they had junior high  for a while and you graduated from it, and then a senior. But they  changed that junior high  stuff  after awhile.  My daddy bought us a Ford coupe. Ford was a real popular car in those  days, nice to drive and travel on muddy roads and all that junk. I took  about five kids in my car, I was the driver. We went to Stroud school.  That   s where we graduated from the 8th grade cause this was closed  down. But there   s a new building down there that was built during the  Depression when  Delano  Roosevelt was  President . I was 18, I  remember that I voted for Roosevelt. By the way, every president I   ve  voted for since has been the president. I   m not proud of two of them, but  that   s what happened. My grandson, he ate me out cause I voted for this  one  Obama . I said,    He   s going to be the president,    first time I heard  him speak I said,    He   s going to be the president and I   m voting for  him.    I don   t know why I know, but I do and I voted for Roosevelt when  18  Finchum  Ninness  I was 18.  That school was built during that time, it was the Depression time still  and the farmers built this road that goes to Davenport. It   s called the  Farm to Market Road, 910 now. That was built by the farmers so the  farmers could have a good road to go to town, go shopping, get their  groceries and stuff. The old school was a wooden building closer to the  road, and they put this one back a little farther and that   s rock, but it  burned a few years ago. People were living in it that we sold that farm  to. They lived in it and I told him, I said,    The chimney is made for you,  the stovepipe goes up to the top and the stovepipe goes in there,    but he  stuck it in the bottom where you clean the ashes out. I said,    That   s not  right     but anyhow it burned up. I don   t know whether that   s what did it  or not, but anyway it burned. But the big rock building is still standing. I  remember the south end of the building, Daddy and them had a big  diamond rock put in there and they had me to draw Roosevelt   s picture  and put on there and they chiseled it out in there. And it   s still up there.  Is that a WPA building?  Uh-huh. A WPA building. All this work was WPA roadwork and  everything to keep the men, give them a job. I was married part of that  time, see I married during the Depression. We had gotten laid off from  the oil fields. When I married him we went to the oil fields and went to  work, he got that job in oil fields and he stayed with his cousin. Of  course, quick as his cousin introduced me to him down there at the  filling station, he told his cousin,    I   m going to marry that girl.     Took him a year and a half to talk me into it but. (Laughs) Anyway, he  come back and stayed at his cousin   s house and asked me for a date. We  done that about a year and a half before we got married. We got married  during the    30s, during the Depression. He worked in the oil fields all  that time, and these kids were all born here and everything. The oldest  boy was born in Seminole and then this one I came home to Mom and  had him  Romeyn . Then we got laid off. The Depression got so bad that  the companies began to lay off their workers. He was laid off and we  came back here to the farm and lived and then sharecropped on the farm.  My Daddy always had two sharecroppers. There was one that lived  straight west here and then one up in the house in the field that helped  take care of the farm.  They all went to California in those days   Daddy would take produce from the farm and peddle it to all the oil field  towns. He bought a big truck with a flat bed on it and put sideboards on  it and  he and Tom Cummings, a neighbor  hauled watermelons, green  beans, corn, didn   t have frozen trucks then that brought frozen fresh  vegetables from anywhere. He peddled them and peddled apples. He  19  said you always have to go around and knock on the door and if they  didn   t answer, he   d go around back and woman would be outside  washing, didn   t have a washing machine, kettle boiling the clothes.  She   d always buy a bushel or two bushels and can them apples. And  that   s the way he helped make a living. Of course, we lived up here then  until he  Romeyn  was born. He was born in    34 and we had just gone  back to work. It kind of began to pick up then, and the oil company said,     If we ever go back to work, we   ll call you.    So we moved to Asher and  we lived in Asher when he was born and I was doctoring  my family  up  here so I came back here. He was born up here.  But anyway, his cousin lived at that filling station, they   d meet us every  night down there, us girls. Oh I remember one time I had about four girls  in there with me, we only had one boy that rode and the rest was all  girls, my sister and I and the other girls. One of them dared me to wave  at Clarence when he come out on his cousin   s porch. He   d grab the  broom and come out and sweep it every morning before we went by you  know, knew when we was coming by to go to school. I said,    I ain   t  afraid to wave at him.    So I waved at him. (Laughs) The girls teased me  from then on then. Of course I didn   t care who I flirted with, it didn   t  matter to me. I had a lot of good fun times. Went with a lot of boys  before I ever met him. I had company, we had farm people then they  usually had two or three boys in the family and everything. And so I   d  go if they wanted to go somewhere.  We had square dances in our  homes     moved out all the chairs from the living room.   We had pie suppers at the country schools and we took boxes and  decorated them with crepe paper. You could buy crepe paper then by the  package in dime stores. And you could gather them on the machine and  make ruffles or pleats or something and roses. Mrs.  Jim  Howell over  there two miles, one mile east of us, she   d make the prettiest roses I   d  ever laid eyes on and she dipped them in paraffin. They looked just like  real roses, they was pretty. We   d decorate those pie boxes and take pies  and that   s the way they made their money to buy Christmas gifts and  candies and stuff for the children, school children at Christmas time. All  the schools around here had pie suppers. Of course, my husband he had  to buy my pie when we went there and he like banana cream pie. Mama  would make that and then had pure cow cream you could beat and make  whipping cream, good stuff to eat. Now you buy old junk out of the  stores and a bunch of junk is put in it until it don   t even taste like cow  cream.   When we decorated those pie boxes for the school pie supper (we went  to all the schools nearby, not just our own) they were really pretty. All  the neighbor ladies and young ladies all gathered some night in  someone   s home, after all the farm household chores and supper dishes  20  were done. Nearly almost every home had a sewing machine in it.  Ladies utilized all the attachments to their machines. Pleats and gathers  were made by the yards. Bolts or packages of crepe paper put out by  dimension came to life, colors, pink, red, all shades of green. Used  baling wire off the farmers    bale of hay he   d just opened to feed the  cows that night (or the past week). You never threw the wire in the field  if you didn   t want it to be hung up in your mowing machine, or other  farm equipment, later on. It was wrapped with one inch wide strips of  green crepe paper. Every so often a cluster of green paper leaves on wire  were inserted and wrapped into the stem.  We even took the tiny nail from off a well-worn old used household  broom and unwound a very fine wire that held all those broom straws in  a cluster at the bottom of a well-worn broom handle. The fine wires  were used at the center back of the leaves also. With another, same  pattern, leaf glued over the wire or some piece of matching paper to hold  the wire on. We used a lot of glue in those days.  That Mrs. Jim Howell, who lived one mile east of us, could make the  prettiest curled leaves and rose petals. We   d cut out a petal shape, use  our thumbs to make a rose petal    cup    in the center of the petal. She   d  use an old hat pin and curl the petal, the outer edge, curve it over, then  push it up on the hat pin and crinkle the rose petal outer edge. We   d  make a ball of paper in the center to build the petals around. Using the  finer wire, we   d wrap petal after petal around the clump in the center.  Add a wire around the base of the rose and cover the wire with green  paper. Add it to the heavy wire, along with the leaves, wrapping all with  one inch strips of green colored crepe paper to the bottom end. When  Mrs. Howell melted paraffin (every household had blocks of paraffin  they used to seal jars of jelly at canning time), she   d dip that newly made  rose in melted paraffin, cool it, put it on that shirred or pleated or ruffled  decorated box. You   d have such a pretty box with no name on it, only a  number.  When the auctioneer yelled    sold    that ole country boy, or city dude,  who came and was enticed to buy his favorite, or new girl   s box, would  part with his last cotton pickin    dollar. After all, it was for buying those  little kids a red mesh Santa sock full of an orange in the toe and lots of  nuts and candy at Christmas time. After the school Christmas program  was finished, everyone heard Santa coming in the back door. By the  way, this is the only time of year I ever saw an orange.   Oh, I can remember one time we had a cow that Mama   s mother left her.  They lived over here on this first farm, joined our farm on the west. I  think Mr. Murphy had a homestead up around Kendrick    cause that   s  where his daughter stayed and taught school    til she died. He would buy,  21  Finchum  Ninness  evidently, farms up and he had bought this one next to us. Her mother  and father   he   d rent it out to sharecroppers and her daddy was a  sharecropper. They was living in that house and Mama said when they  married they   d walk over to the back side   now my brother can  remember when buffalos had a wallow up on his 80 acres, north side of  this. But I can   t remember much about that except them talking. But he  knew right where the wallow was on the side of the hill. Then she said  that that was called an old pond and there   s springs where that buffalo  wallowed on his part of the farm and water came down  from a spring   and came down on this way. Of course that was lots of water and Mama  said they kept a boat tied up over there  on the back side of the farm   and they   d walk over to that old pond and then  take a  boat across to  Murphy   s side. Then they   d get out and walk up and visit her mama and  daddy and them and then they   d come back and take the boat and come  back home. But the water don   t stand like that anymore. But when we  have a big overflow it goes up there. Daddy had made two different  ditches for that water to drain down out of those springs that still comes  out of the earth up there on the north 80 of this farm.  So it was originally 160 acres?  Yeah, that   s what you homesteaded. Oh, I   ll go back to that,    cause  when my grandfather lived here for years before, then the government  decides they   re going to take Indian Territory and Creek Nation  east of  Indian Territory, now Lincoln County  and divide it up and homestead it  for people. They had Indians all down there and this Indian Chief   s wife  had died and she moved down there and my grandparents were living  here. Well, they surveyed and made 160 acres for everybody   s farm  around. They came to my grandfather and you have to run for it. He  said,    This, I own this land, it belongs to me and this house too. The  Indian Chief gave it to me,    and he   d been there for years. They said,     We don   t care, it   s too far from the Indian reservation,    when they  came to survey the 160 acres  for settlement lands .  Grandma told me that he went over to Creek Nation line and when the  gun went off he ran to Chandler and filed his claim and homesteaded  this then. So we   re still here. So he homesteaded. Then, of course, he  died after that. I don   t know the dates or years or anything. We were too  poor to put up tombstones so I don   t have any dates over there but they  have that record chart. A lady in Davenport asked me one time when she  was getting old and going to leave, she asked me to take the books but I  didn   t think I knew enough, and I don   t know, for some reason I didn   t  do it. Then somebody else took them. But they were smart enough to  take the records to Chandler and make a file of all the cemetery stuff. So  they do have that.  22  But Morcellious, my brother, he went over when the caretaker, can   t  remember his name, was mowing. He has a job now mowing the  cemetery and cutting it up and my brother   you donate money to help  pay for the gasoline and stuff, mowing and things. When Don took us  around on that trip, there   s a new fence put around the cemetery and I  asked him,    Is this gate in the same place it was a long time ago before  they put the new fence up?    He said,    Yes, they put the gate in the same  place.    I said,    Well, I can remember exactly going in and where my  grandmother   s graves are.    Although, there   s no stones there. But it   s on  the record. My brother said it don   t have each individual mark.  I finally  remember, my grandmother Royer saying lots of times,    It   s right across  the path north of Hiram Cook   s lots.    There is a four foot lovely big  stone at his grave.   Grandpa Hopper  not really her grandpa but that   s what all the kids  called him     this was the highway  Highway 49 at the time , so there  was a filling station and  he owned  a grocery store right across from our  schoolhouse  North Slope . He raised his two grandsons and his  granddaughter, and the oldest one  Virgil  kind of liked me. By the way,  I still had his little valentine card he gave me; it burned up in the house.  Oh, it was just a little old piece of paper folded up like a book about two  or three inches square  At Valentine time, we had a pretty decorated box  and everybody put their Valentine cards in it for their sweetheart and  best friends. Believe it or not, he gave me one. It had on it a cute dressed  little girl and an attractive bashful boy giving her with a blushing face  and under a pretty decorated hat, a big bouquet of flowers. That lovely  Valentine stayed in my trunk all these years and burned in our house fire  in 2002.  That was my first valentine I guess. Of course he liked me and  he   d bring candy to me from Grandpa   s store. I kind of liked him and  then there was a boy who lived over here by Star School, about two or  three miles  west . The school went every so far, I don   t remember now,  a woman told me. But there had to be a school every so far and there  was one over here named Star. When you go west on that  road, 910  road now , it   s about maybe 3 miles, but 2 and a half miles anyway.  I  think the schools were located one in every four miles.   On the south side, there was a lot of irises. They had the yellow iris then,  they called them flags. And that school, the field was just full of them  and that   s where the schoolhouse was. These kids were sharecroppers  over there, a boy and a girl, and that was a good looking boy. Boy I liked  him fairly well. I had two boyfriends, Virgil and I can   t remember that  kid   s name now. I went to see Virgil after he married and lived in  Drumright one time, I heard he was living up there, so I went up and  visited him, him and his wife. I asked him how he met his wife, he said  he met her over here at Davenport. Of course, I was married and gone by  then. I lived away from here all my life in the oil fields down around  23  Finchum  Ninness  Asher and Cherry Hill and Pierson Switch and St. Louis, there was a St.  Louis down there too.  Cherry Hill? I haven   t heard that one.  Cherry Hill. It   s south of St. Louis. The oil company had a lease out  there. Let   s see, when we first married, we went on a lease called Gypsy  Oil Company and it was a Gypsy lease. That oil company had two  different names, I forgot what the other one was, Gulf. Gulf Oil  Company and Gypsy was the same, maybe one bought the other one out  or something, I don   t know. But when we married it was Gypsy Oil  Company and we lived on the Gypsy lease. Their main office was over  by Wewoka. My husband would stay in a boarding house and have   I  got acquainted with the girl that ran the boarding house, she married a  man, her 2nd husband and lived on the same lease we did, so I got well  acquainted with her. She ran the boarding house and my husband would  stay in the boarding house and eat his meals there when he was in the oil  fields that week. Then he   d come up here on the weekends to his  cousin   s and visit him.  That   s when he would come to see me.   Talk about my new bridge down here, I   m so proud of it. It   s been  changed about three times I think since I grew up here. The reason why  it washed out this time, stupid county, state, whoever, decided you can   t  burn the trash, it has to be piled up on the bank and you can   t burn logs  or trees or anything. I hope they changed their minds now. They cleaned  that river out and piled the biggest stack, big as this house, up on the  south side of the bank and we had a high overflow and it washed all  them logs down to the bridge and they can   t go through so the water  goes around the ends of the bridge and took all the dirt and everything  with it and washed the bridge out. So that   s what happened to our bridge  down there. Then they decided to build new bridges, so they put this one  back in line with the original one that I can remember going across when  I was a kid going to school. We walked from here down there all the  time to school,  one-half mile .  And since this was a main highway Mama took the Kansas City Star and  the Cappers Weekly. That was our main papers then. In New York, they  was kidnapping kids and grabbing them off the road or anything and she  warned us about if a car, since this was a main highway, if anyone slows  down by you all, you run under the fence and out through the field and  get away from them. Don   t you talk to anybody or go up to any car.  Because that   s what was going on then. It   s thick everywhere now and  then it was in big cities, kidnapping girls and so on and so forth.  We walked back and forth and I can remember   by the way, that barn  was right down there on the other side of that cedar tree and the wagons  24  went back and forth and then they   d cross that way and come to the  barn, hitched the horses and things and fed them. Then the road came up  right here and it   s real sloping out there, I   ve had two loads of dirt put in  that. It came on up here and the road you all came up is the original road  that went down to the mailbox and the house was put on that side over  there. Well, that   s at least six or seven or maybe eight feet deep, that  road is. Just a couple of years ago I let my neighbor bulldoze all the  banks off because I got a man that   s putting up hay and putting cows in  here and he wanted to make it pretty, he said,    It   ll be level and you  could mow the grass and this and that.    I had flowers on the south bank,  the prettiest you ever saw. I hated to part with that and I wish now I  hadn   t have. I had wild rose that was the pink roses over 100 years old  that I brought and put down there. I had lilacs and I had day lilies and  jonquils and all kinds of pretty flowers, flags, iris. Of course, they all  went down there  in a big pile  but I let him do that. But when you all go  down that road, you   ll see how deep and that was the original, came  right around here by this well and back down that way to the barn.  By the way, I did not know why that big old cement block right out  there, you could see right in front of where you parked your car, it   s  about 4 feet square on the end and it   s about 6 or 8 feet long. Mama one  day told me that   s where my grandfather   s blacksmith shop was. I guess  he did his blacksmithing, pounding of iron and stuff you know on that  cement block. But when I grew up, Daddy had  his shop  right here on  west of that cedar tree. That   s where it was when we moved back here.  The old barn was still down there that Daddy had and so my husband  decided too much manure had been piled up around and then the barn  was lower and it was staying muddy and wet so he decided to move it  out by where it is now out toward the pond,  north of the house .  This  question guide  says describe a typical day from rising to going to  bed then and now. Well now we don   t do much of anything except sit  here in our chair. But my sister and I, that old brick house had 16 steps  from the bottom to the top, counted them more times, I know exactly  how many there are. Daddy had told me, I already described to you it  was made of walnut in there, saw marks are still on it, you can see them.  But we had a brother, my sister, me, my brother older than me, and then  me and then my sister. My brother could tease my sister and make her  mad; she   d cry over anything, get so mad. And he teased her all the time  but he couldn   t make me mad. I didn   t cry, it didn   t bother me for  anybody to tease me. So she was always teased all the time and when  we   d go upstairs to bed. When we were in Wyoming, Daddy killed wild  animals and they had a deer or elk I guess it was that he had mounted  and brought back. Then he had I guess it was a bear or coyote or  something, a bear hide that was a rug. The head was there and my  brother was always scaring her with that old bear rug, he   d go upstairs.  25   hide and jump out at us . She was scared of her shadow.     Where did the material used in the farms, buildings come from?    Well,  there   s been quite a bit of argument about where the brick came from  that was made, and they   re just as red as this clay is around here, but  Mama has finally said it was made at a kiln at the agency. They think.  Davenport also had a brick plant, but I don   t know what, maybe it was  later because Davenport wasn   t even here then. My Daddy did tell me  one time, he said,    Hortense, you see these cement these bricks are put  together with?    He said,    That is slack lime stuff that they went over to  Creek County, (Creek Nation, and Indian Territory) and there   s a  cropping of rock that   s about two miles south of Stroud and about a half  a mile or mile east down where Key West used to be and you could go  over there and see those big layers of rock. That   s what they brought  over here and made the limestone to put the brick house together with.     So that   s what it was made with.  (Laughs) Oh I got to tell you about the horse. We had a team that  plowed the fields then. But Daddy did buy a tractor when I was a pretty  good sized kid when tractors came out  that had big iron wheels with  cleats across them to be able to pull better on the fields and dirt . Daddy  was real good about, I guess he learned a lot of this agriculture stuff  from his father, and any time Stillwater had agriculture things and the  county thing over at Chandler, he was good about doing all the updated  farming stuff that Stillwater and the government had at things. I had a  stack of books about this high that the government gives you free, of  agriculture, how to take care of blackberries, how to do peaches, and  how to do everything. Mama   s middle sister, she went to school and  graduated as a county home demonstration agent. And through her we   d  get all this literature and I had a stack about this high that burned up that  I had upstairs in the brick house. God, I had read every one of them,  landscaping the yard, and roses, and everything else.  But Daddy then, he terraced it about the ditches, then during this time he  learned about terracing through terracing farm and this farm is terraced  now. And my husband he came back here, he hated to drive his tractor  up over them terraces and plow and stuff, he said,    I want to plow them  things down.    I said,    You better not, my Daddy terraced them to keep  the land from washing away, so you better leave them alone.    So they   re  still out there. But I can remember when and it kind of makes me mad  because I don   t act on my thoughts I get. My daddy, I can remember I  was little when this went on, and I can remember Mama said he didn   t  have enough money and he wanted to terrace his farm and it cost a  hundred dollars for that terracing equipment, that survey. And so he got  George Eikenburg, lived over here on the farm that joins this one, joins  up at where my brother is, he has just half a mile down through here and  26  then this one   s another one. He had George Eikenburg pay  50 and  Daddy paid  50. Mama didn   t have any place to keep the survey  equipment. Mrs. Eikenburg had an attic upstairs so she kept it all the  time and then when they sold it to Bertha Raines and her husband  Leo   and they traded houses  in town for the country , Mrs. Eikenburg went  to town with her second husband she married. Then I thought,    Well I  need to go over there because I know she   s got all that junk up there in  that attic and get that surveying equipment.    I didn   t, I just let it go. I  didn   t act on it. Her only son that   s left, Johnny, my age, lives in  Washington, he came back here and got it and took it to Washington   state  with him. I don   t know what good it   ll do him out in Washington,  sell it I guess.  Down at Paden I believe is where Daddy learned about a man that raised  sweet potatoes and sold them. Cotton was kind of going out then and so  he went in to raising sweet potatoes and my house is built over a  basement here where it was a sweet potato house. You can see the  cement out there that side of the house of the foundation that went down  about six feet or more. He had a stove in that end, a stove in this end   east and west . Then there was the top of the house, went up as high as  a barn or a house. And then they made bins or corrals and sections and it  was made out of 1 X 4   s with an inch crack between it so the sweet  potatoes when they went in there were kiln dried. The fire would dry the  sweet potatoes out and the air circulated between the boards. He would  do that in the fall. So he went down there and learned about sweet  potatoes and this farm would be planted with sweet potatoes.  All of it,  sand hills and all.   By the way, he invented a planter one time to put these sweet potatoes  out with. Similar to a cotton planter type I guess, but cotton planter men  didn   t have to sit at the back. Daddy fixed this where two men set at the  back and one would put the sweet potato to plant in and the other would  put the next one in and next one in, next one in and everybody talked  about him inventing that so he thought maybe he might could sell it to  somebody or something. He wrote the company and the company sent  two men out and Mama said,    They   ll steal it from you.    So sure enough  they did, he didn   t get anything out of that. But anyway, that was a sweet  potato planter that a team pulled the planter and the two men sat behind  it and put one row at a time of sweet potatoes out. Then we chopped  them and all that junk.   In in the fall we gathered them to store in the sweet potato house.  Lillian White and I carried a long crate. Daddy built a slatted box about  two feet long and about 14 inches wide on either end. It had a hand hole  sawed in each solid end to carry it by. Each person stood, one on each  side of a row. You grew the sweet potatoes on a ridge. The potatoes  27  were plowed out and the two people held the slatted box across the top  of the row while walking in the furrow (bottom of the lowed field),  probably barefooted (no dirt in your shoes that way and the fresh plowed  ground felt good, too). They   d dig out the beautiful big yellow sweet  potatoes and place them, carefully, into the crate. You did not throw  them in, that would scar them and the potato would have to    heal    over  while it was curing out in the warm building. Remember this is fall and  winter. The coolest time of the year. The potatoes had to be    dried out     to keep all winter .  He went down there and learned from that man how to do sweet potatoes  and how to plant them and we didn   t raise cotton anymore, it was all  sweet potatoes. He built on this roadside going down, he took the bank  on the south side and he got oil field pipes and he made oh about 30 feet  long beds and about just wide enough that you could be on this side and  this side and you could reach across it and pull the slips out of the sweet  potatoes. And you saved the little bitty, tiny, long, slim sweet potato and  you bedded them out in sand and about six inches deep or something,  three or four inches of dirt on top, and he put that thing out there, and  kept water. We had a windmill  attached to a water tank made from a  steel oil field tank set on end  and we pumped it full of water. He  irrigated those about six beds down through there going from the house  down the road toward the mailbox on the south side and they would be  about 40 feet or more long. And that was full of sweet potato, little  plants, just  small long tiny sweet potatoes  you   d put out and then  they   d put up a little shoot and when it was about six inches high, you  pulled the slip out  and sold it or planted it in your field for a crop to  gather and peddle for income .   The water tank is a 20 to 25 foot tall, six foot wide (or maybe 8) steel  tank, stood on end and cemented in. Daddy had a windmill that kept it  full of water. We used the water to keep the plant beds watered so the  tiny six inch long slim potatoes would sprout and come up through the  six inches of sand.   Then we went back to the bottom, back to the backside and got clay and  made a clay mud in a tub or something and you mopped that, you   d  pull   we used to sell them 25 cents a hundred, and we got tired of  counting to a hundred so we went to just measuring them with our hands  and giving them all that  we could hold that many between a thumb and  forefinger . You took those roots and you put mud on the bottom of  them, then you rolled them in sand so they wouldn   t stick together and  you stacked them up in a bushel basket. Those are the plants you took  then and those men sat on there and held them baskets and put them  plants in the ground. Lots of people came around and bought sweet  potato plants from us, 25 cents a hundred. Those  pipes  were still there  28     til we came back to farm it. My husband took the pipes out and used  them for things, I don   t know what,  so we could plow the ground for a  crop .  He used the windmill to pump the water in the house   oh, at one time  when the oil fields came down here and began to put wells around, they  put some south of us and several wells I guess, they   re not there   I  don   t know if they   re there now or not  probably not , but those trucks  go that way. But Daddy would go down and he also made gasoline and  sold it. Had a pumper that, well I guess it was quite a few wells around  because the pumper lived on the backside of Murphy   s place, the west  side. He had a nephew in Virginia that came here and visited and I dated  him. I got a letter to marry him the day I accepted my husband   s  proposal. (Laughs) I never did tell him that because I didn   t think he   d  like it. But anyway, that man taught my daddy how to make gasoline out  of the  drip  oil. The pipe  line  had drips on them and people would  steal gasoline off the drips  and burn it in their cars, old Model-T . Well,  Daddy got permission to get all that gasoline and stuff and that oil and  mixture of stuff and he refined it and we sold gasoline, five cents a  gallon whenever I was going to high school. People would come up  here, he put a filling station out there and the cement base is still out  there of the building, and sold gasoline to everybody, five cents a gallon.  Can you imagine that? Now it   s over  4.  But Daddy was a good manager, my husband used to say,    I wish I was  as smart as your daddy is to make a living like he did.    Of course, his  daddy died when he was nine years old. And it was just he and his  mother left, the other boys were grown and married and gone. Daddy  told me one time   and I learned to eat squirrels, turtles, rabbits, fish,  everything. He said,    Every morning I   d get up and take my gun, walk a  mile east, kill squirrels, come back and have them for breakfast.    Put his  trout lines in the creek and have fish for dinner, if he caught a turtle he   d  have that for supper. I learned how to clean a turtle too, just as good as  anybody, and skin a squirrel. Oh Lord. People wouldn   t eat a turtle now.  My husband   s mother came here one time and Mama cooked turtle for  dinner, and chicken for dinner. And so they fooled her, they told her, she  said,    I want some of that chicken down there, I don   t want none of that  turtle.    They passed her the turtle and she ate it and she didn   t know the  difference. (Laughs) They teased her a long time about that. Then we  used to have a lot of rabbits. You don   t hardly see rabbits anymore, can   t  hardly see one jump up and run across the highway as we drive along.  Oh and whenever we chopped the cotton and the sweet potatoes and  things, all the sharecroppers    kids around here, there   d be three or four  kids in a family. Mama would go out there and work, chop cotton with  us   oh, and we came in for dinner, too. She would never let us go back  29  Finchum  to the field till we laid down and rested about 15 minutes because she  said,    Your food needs to rest in your stomach, give it a chance to digest  and stuff.    But Jim Murphy told me his daddy drove him like a horse, he  said,    We couldn   t even talk at the table, and the minute we got done  eating, we would have to go back to the field.    But we weren   t that kind  of a family and Mama made us go in the front room and lay down  on  the floor  and rest, or whatever we wanted to do until 15 or 20 minutes  went by and by then I guess she had the kitchen done up enough she  went to the field with us too, I guess, or went to the garden.  When we got done at night chopping, we came in to do the chores and  things, she   d take all the kids and go to the Dry Creek  the road bridge   and we   d go down to that swimming hole and jump in the river and  swim and get the dirt off of us and wash our hair. Oh, and in the  summertime, you kept a tub of water out there, drew it up from the well  and the sun warmed the water and then when it got dark you took your  bath out there. And then of course, boys better not peek or   (clears  throat) anyway. I   m sure they probably peeked plenty. (Laughs) Boys do  stuff like that. Girls probably don   t care either, giggle and laugh too. But  I loved to swim down at that swimming hole.  I could lay on my back  and float. My mama could too. None of the other kids could. I can still  float. My husband never did learn to swim.   My brother told me, he said that   s the first place he kissed his wife  was  in the swimming hole at Dry Creek. I just lost my brother recently. He  was 11 months older than I. He   d have been 98 in August this year.   Before he died, he was sick and the girls come and took him to the  hospital and the oldest girl said,    Daddy talked all the way to town about  you and Mama when you was going together.    I guess up there he told  her, said the first time he met her they was evidently sharecropping  down in there. Everybody gathered pecans and Mama told me pecans  sold for one cent a pound when she married Daddy and they gathered  pecans and sold them. Just imagine what you   d pay now for them.  They   d gather them pecans and take them to town, get one cent a pound  for them. Well this girl had gathered a flour sack full of pecans and he  seen her over there and he went over and went to talking to her and he  poured her pecans all out on the ground and then they picked them up  together. (Laughs) Then later she went swimming in the creek there with  us all swimming and he said that   s where he kissed her; first time he   d  ever kissed her was in the creek swimming. I don   t remember where my  husband kissed me at first, I didn   t care much about it anyway. (Laughs)  Didn   t bother me, he was just somebody to go with. But I loved walking  down that road going swimming in that swimming pool. We went bare  footed all the time too and I still go bare footed.  What would you do if you got a bee sting?  30  Ninness  Oh, it didn   t worry me. My daddy raised bees. He had lots of bees down  here because they pollinated your fruit trees and everything. But I didn   t  go around them enough to get stung, but Daddy got stung and it didn   t  bother him, he said,    Good for your arthritis.    He didn   t worry about it.  But bees didn   t seem to bother him; he had a veil he put on, but he never  did put gloves or anything on. So after we grew up and married and  come back to the farm, Mama wanted me to have bees again, so she  ordered me the set of bees and the queen and everything, and of course  the hives was all still around here. I had bee hives and I remember I had  two out here in front.  By then my husband was spraying pecans, a man in Tulsa had worked at  a, oh I forgot the name of that logging company in eastern Oklahoma.  Cut trees and sold lumber. He had quit that and was retired and he  bought this farm across here and he had somebody to take care of  pecans. He lived in Tulsa so he   d come down and take care of pecans.  So he finally hired my husband to work the field over there and spray  pecans and things. One morning he went out and sprayed those tassels  and my bees went out for nectar and they all died. That was the end of  my bees. I never even thought about it or I   d put a block of wood or a  brick or something right on their entrance and not let them out    til noon  or so.  My brother has just recently sold 70 acres of his farm, of the 80, to a  man that was keeping cattle on there all the time and our neighbor kid,  the Hopkins still have farms north of us and he   s dead and the son, well  second or third generation now. And this man asked that boy if when he  sprayed his clover, he   s got clover on that corner, and he said,    I spray  before it blooms so it shouldn   t kill his bees.    But if he sprays when it   s  in bloom, those bees are going to be dead. He brought out just the other  day a bunch of hives and things and fixed his supers up down there for  them. He said he had some close to my fence up here too. He   s got them  scattered kind of in different places on the farm up there. Three or four  of them anyway. So he   s raising them.  But I haven   t raised bees since then. I   ve still got Daddy   s bee hives and  things. He had them in town, too. He raised bees in Stroud where he  lived in town. So after he died, I   ve got all that junk out here in my  trailer house. I   m going to sell it one of these days. One of the nurses at  the doctor said,    Oh call my cousin,    and she gave me his name over  about Arcadia, down that way somewhere. I called him and he was  going to come over and he was going to call me, but he never did show  up. They   re still out there, so I   ve got to sell them one of these days to  somebody.  We always had pecans to eat at night and popcorn to pop, and we  31  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  popped it in an ironwood heater stove in the front room at night. Mama  would always sweep the floor after everybody went to bed because she  didn   t want to walk on pecan shells when she got up the next morning.  But we had a popcorn popper and we stuck it down in the lid of this  wood stove, wood heating stove, and popped that popcorn. We all sat  around in old straight back chairs, ate popcorn before we went to bed. Of  course, the popcorn is what we grew, it wasn   t bought.  Of course, we don   t have any crops now, it   s all hay and cattle and stuff  now. A couple of more buildings that were on this place were right out  here where this dairy barn is, there was an old clapboard building that  Daddy used as a coal oil shed and a fuel shed where we kept the oil and  everything for the tractors and the lamps and whatnot. Just west of that  was a turkey house where they kept their turkeys and the chickens and  stuff.  Turkeys?  Yeah, Daddy raised turkeys at one time. He was always growing  something. At one time, he had sheep here and another time he raised  turkeys and we   d always have to shut those things up at night because  coyotes and things would catch them. Now they   ve put wild turkeys  back out here. This farm is up close to that pyramid I told you about. We  called it a pyramid when I was growing up, I don   t know why, but they  call it a monument now. Monument Road goes  straight north one and a  half mile to 66. The man a half a mile north on that side has bought that  land and he planted wheat and one day I came in from town and there  was about 30 turkeys out there, wild turkeys. And when the men were  building this house, they said they counted a whole bunch  30 or more   out here while they was putting the roof on, that had been coming up out  here. I came in one evening and one was out in the road. But I got a dog  out here now, so the turkeys aren   t coming up here  but wild hogs do .  We still have one of the farm machineries out there by the pond that my  daddy and them used, I guess. What is that thing, Romeyn? A cotton  planter or what? Still setting out there we had when I was a kid. Daddy  always used two teams though and one time he bought a   every once in  a while he   d have to get a new horse or something, and one time he  bought a big old pretty horse that was the most beautiful thing you ever  looked at. I think it was a lot like these that pull the - what do you call  them   a horse that   s got hair all around the feet. What do they call those  horses?  Clydesdales.   Not  Clydesdales.  Perchins  Yeah, it was great big and he only had the  one. I can remember that horse and Mama commented on it a lot, every  32  time he got through in the field and brought them in and turned them  loose and everything, he   d go out and get up high on the pond bank,  south end of the pond bank that went around and held the water. At one  time our historical society gave a plaque for anything that was so many  pieces over 50 years old and I can count a dozen of them, that pond was  one of them. That horse would face the east, stand there every evening  and face the east. I can still see him standing, I was going to paint it one  time, I do paintings, and all my paintings burned up except the ones I  gave away. I told you how Daddy took the groceries and the produce  and peddled them at the  homes in the oil fields, Drumright and east .  He bought a new tractor and they had an old iron wheel one when they  first came out and then got rubber tires on them later. And the thrashing  machine, I think my brother   s got some pictures of them when he was a  kid here and they thrashed the wheat and stuff   wasn   t wheat, I don   t  know what they thrashed,  oats probably .  He had a hay baler and I can remember when Daddy grew sorghum  molasses one time here too. It was between here and the road on the  north side of the driveway and as you went down there, they had a  sorghum mill. I was big enough that I can remember they had   but I  never did figure out how them horses or donkeys or whatever they was,  mules, went around and around. They went around and ground the thing  and kept that sorghum going through those rollers. A wagon load of  sorghum canes would come down and the men would push that through  the rollers and the rollers squeezed the juice out and the juice ran down  into a pan. The pan was a great long thing, long as this room is here and  about six feet wide, had little troughs in it. The sorghum would boil at  this end when it went in, it boiled, and went down that end, went through  that crack and came down this end boiling and went back and forth that  way until it got to the end of the sorghum trough. Then it came out good  sorghum already cooked like it was supposed to be, like you   d buy in the  store and eat.  People came with their gallon buckets and got a pail full  to take home or the wife and kids to eat, with those hot homemade  biscuits and real cow butter.   But I never could figure out how those horses or mules or donkeys or  whatever it was went around and around and around to grind that  through that thing. Somebody told me later that they stepped over the  tongue of the wagon or whatever it was.  There was a shaft in the center  that came up that had a gear on it that ran everything and the horses  turned the shaft.  And those rollers, there was two big rollers that  squashed the juice out as it came and went through. They were big  rollers, heavy metal. They was kind of long, at least three or four feet  long, maybe longer than that, I don   t know. The juice went down into  that pan and you kept a fire at the south end of that panel. There was a  33  Finchum  Ninness  fire that you kept sticking wood in to keep this panel cooking, the syrup  cooking. When it went from one end to the other it was sorghum. It was  juice when it came in up here and it was sorghum when it came out  down there. They sold that in gallon buckets or something too.  Pretty good on biscuits.  Yeah, boy. I still buy sorghum and eat it, I like sorghum.  There   s a big tree that   s still standing down here, cottonwood I guess it  is, I don   t know. But a little girl that lived down there, a sharecropper,  she must   ve been about 13 when she pulled that up out of the woods and  brought it and put it   and she   s dead and gone now, her kids are dead  and her husband   s dead, her brothers and sisters are dead. So it   s been a  long time ago. The house is not there and the house I lived in up in the  field. The field had two sharecrop houses on it and they   re both gone but  there   s a water well at each one of them still down in the ground. That  one up there had a cellar at it, but I imagine it   s all caved in and gone by  now. This man that lived down here   Daddy always let the  sharecroppers have a garden and cows and chickens and everything, and  he had hogs. And down this way, at one time, Daddy had this bottom  full of alfalfa field.  Then, he built a dam down here on our section line between this and  Johnny Mars. That big dam, he put an opening in it that he could keep  the water on these bottoms to water the alfalfa and then when he wanted  it let out he   d open that gate and let the water go out. That junk is still  down there, but just on this side of it is where this man had his hogs in  the bottoms down there and Daddy fixed a water well and it had an old  pitcher pump and it   s still down there that he   d pump water for those  hogs and raised hogs while he was here. The house is gone, but that tree  is still standing.  Oh, we had an old man that came here, that   s quite interesting. Those  days you didn   t have a social security number to track you with. This old  man for some reason, I don   t know why, Mama would question him a lot  but he never would tell anything. And you could get lost in them days.  He came from Nebraska. When he got as far as here, he liked the meals  Mama cooked and fed and he worked on the farm and he didn   t ever  want any money. All he wanted was a clean shirt and overalls in the  spring and in the fall, that   s all he asked for. He lived with us    til the old  man got old and had to go, I had a baby girl then, and he got old and  went to the Creek County poor farm and that   s where he died. But when  he got old and knew someday he   d have to go somewhere because he  didn   t have anybody to take care of him and he didn   t want Mama to. He  said he   d go to Lincoln County  then Creek County poor farm. No such  34  Finchum  Ninness  thing as a nursing home then .   Lincoln County  had a poor farm over toward Edmond somewhere,  between here and there, way over there. He   d go stay there for awhile. It  was called a poor farm in those days, not a nursing home. Then he   d go  to Creek County which is only two miles over there and a little bit  further to the house. He   d stay at least two weeks, trying to decide which  one treated him the best and which one took care of him the best and  that   s where he was going to go. He ended up going to Creek County. I  lived up here on the farm and I had my second baby then and he came  up to tell me goodbye. I had a little girl and he held her on his lap. It just  liked to kill me when Uncle Sib left. I said,    Mama, I   ll take care of him,  he don   t have to go to the nursing home.    Mama said,    Hortense, you  can   t do it. He   s too old and he can   t take care of himself. You can   t do  it.    I wasn   t well then either, I had a, what do you call it in your lungs?  Pneumonia?   Not  Pneumonia type thing  tuberculosis  or something because the  doctor had me to strip off to my waist and set out in the sunshine so long  everyday. Mama never could decide if that old man was a doctor or a  lawyer. She said he was the smartest old man she ever seen in her life.  He came here with two footlockers full of books and things and he had a  doctor   s book and a lawyer   s book, because they all studied out of a big  old thick book, three or four inches thick. He had that thing full of books  and Mama said that was the smartest man she ever saw. She did find out  one time that he came from Nebraska and he had been married at one  time. But she never did know why he left or anything about him. He  came this far and he liked living here so he lived here from a young man     til he died. I was real little when he came, I can   t remember how old I  was. We always just called him Uncle Sib is all I know. Name was Sib  Hallgarth. Mama did find out from him that he had a sister in Puget  Sound out at Washington  state , wherever that is. After Uncle Sib got  old, she wrote to him but didn   t get no answer back, so I guess she was  dead or something. So we never did know. I been thinking a lot about  sending to Nebraska a letter to a newspaper or something, I don   t know  what the town was named, and let some newspapers print it  to see if we  could locate some relatives. I think they might like to know what  became of him .  Because when I lived in Seminole I had a neighbor when Romeyn was  tiny, he was about two maybe. No, it was when Wybert, my last son,  was born, because he ran off and went to Miss Taylor   s house. I got  acquainted with her, we moved back to the same place we were when  the first boy was born, oil company had moved us from Asher back over  there. This old lady lived on another lease and her name was Miss  35  Taylor and she   d always come over and play with my baby and  everything. It was during the days when permanents were just being  started and you could buy a permanent in the store and give yourself  one. She bought one and she   d come over and she   d have me to fix her  hair and stuff. I could fix hair so she wanted to pay me and it was 10  cents for then, but I said,    I don   t want no money for fixing your hair.     She was wanting to do something so she   d iron my clothes and so I  would visit back and forth with her. One day I asked her where she was  raised, where she was born, this that and the other. She didn   t know  anything about any of her people. She didn   t know nothing. She   d been  married and had one daughter that lived on a lease close to her there and  she   d married and had a boy in the service. Now this is when it was  World War II before that because Wybert was little,    42,    44 he was  born. She began to tell me one day about her family and she said,    I  grew up in an orphanage. My mother died when my little baby sister was  born.    She had two brothers older than her. I said,    What was your name  before you married?    And she said,    Jones    and I said,    Oh it would be  Jones, Smith, or Black or something you couldn   t be able to trace it.     Then, I remembered that the radios had begun to tell, people would write  to the town they   d find people and the radio would announce it. I  thought, I know what I   ll do, I   ll just write to Miami, Oklahoma, Vinita.  There was an orphanage, and that was back in the days when orphanages  wasn   t orphanages.  She said that  old man that run that orphanage said  when the kids get 16 or 18 he   d hire them out to the farmers and the  people around there. She said,    He took my two brothers and put them  on the railroad track. And told them to stay on the railroad track walking  from Tulsa or Vinita up in there until they got to Wewoka and they   d  find their daddy at Wewoka.    I know now that Rupert Jones that we got  acquainted with in the oil field would be that boy   s, her brother, their  daddy. Because Rupert Jones and his daddy run a store in Wewoka. I  know good and well that that would   ve been that old lady   s brother. But  then I didn   t connect it  didn   t know the two at the same time . Then, I  guess, well I don   t know whether I got acquainted with him then or not  but we lived in the oil field. But I didn   t think about it till after I came  back here and had been thinking about it.  So I wrote a letter to the newspaper at Vinita I guess. I told them her  story and she had a sister still living there that married and was still  living in Vinita. I sent it to the Police Department to put it in the paper.  The police took it out to her sister   s house and gave it to her so they  wrote her a letter. And she said,    Oh my sister wants me to come and see  her,    she said,    I don   t know if I can go or not.    I said,    Yeah, we   ll just  put you on a bus and put a tag on the front of your shirt with your name  and address and where you   re going, you won   t get lost, you   ll tell the  bus driver and he   ll take you right up there.    So she did. She went up  36  Finchum  Ninness  there and she said the whole family, her sister and all the kids and  grandkids and everything  were there . She was so thrilled, she came  back. I said,    That was the best thing I ever did in my life I think was to  find that woman   s family for her.    I sure loved that old lady, she was  real sweet.  You make a good detective.  Yeah, but I had heard it on the radio then. TV wasn   t invented yet. I   d  heard stories like that and I said,    Miss Taylor we can find your family.     (Laughs) I asked her a lot of questions and I said,    Now I   ll write the  letter but you   ve got to sign it, I   m not going to sign your name.    So she  signed her own name to that letter. She didn   t know what to write. But  that poor old soul, she wanted to pay me for doing her hair and I said,     Well if you insist on it, you can iron my boys     clothes .    They wore  striped overalls for Sunday to go to church and shirts that I made, I could  buy five yards of material and make three shirts out of it. I could lay the  pattern around in different areas and get my husband and both the boys a  shirt. They wore shirts and striped overalls to church and blue ones  everyday to school. I always ironed their overalls and I said,    Well you  can iron the boys    overalls for me if you want to.    So she   d do that to  help pay for her hair then.  Speaking of shirts, we used to get cement and chicken feed. The cement  came in a heavy woven  bag , almost like burlap but it wasn   t, it was  white. The chicken feed, of course, you could get in all kinds of printed  color sacks. I   d take them and rip them open and we   d have shirts of all  different colors and designs. That was after we moved back here to the  farm and companies began to put a hundred pounds of feed in printed  sacks and it would take four of them to make  a sheet    when  Romeyn   went to college, he took that to college for his bedspread, a sheet that I   d  made. He always made up his bed real nice when he was in college and  he said his house mother said,    He was the only one who took care of  his room like he was supposed to.     But a sheet could be like a bedspread, it was a pretty piece of print,  looked all right. So he just used that and that   s what I sent to college  with him. But when my house burned, I had a whole stack of those feed  sacks upstairs for quilts to make. A whole bunch burned up. I should   ve  got them out and sold them because everybody was wanting them then,  the companies didn   t make them anymore. But I got tickled at my  husband when he always wore a long-sleeve shirt but he   d roll it up. I  said,    Why don   t you buy them short sleeve shirts Evans in Stroud has  got on sale?       I like a long sleeve shirt.    I said,    But you wear it rolled  up all the time.    So Evans had a lumber, furniture, and clothing store in  Stroud; they had a lumber company and a men   s clothing store, Evans  37  did. And I said,    They got them shirts on sale,    they was real cheap, I  don   t remember, maybe 15 cents a piece, I don   t remember, it was back  during the Depression. I went up there and bought five or six of them, I  said,    You can wear these to work at the Allied just as same as the long  sleeve shirts you wear rolled up at any time.    He started wearing them  and then every man up there started wearing short sleeve shirts. Men  wouldn   t wear them to begin with.  In the winter months we had pecans and popcorn and stuff we ate.  Country schools, I told you about the pie suppers we had to make candy  for the kids. Then somebody had to be a Santa Claus and my mama was  big. Heavy-hipped, but she wasn   t very big at the top, we all have large  hips and thighs. But she   d dress up and be Santa Claus for our school  and one year she made every kid in school, the boys a baseball. She  ripped up a baseball, took that leather and made a pattern and she made  every kid a toy, every package at the store was wrapped up with twine.  I   ve got a twine holder right up there that ball of twine went to the  grocery store. Some sat on the desk and I found it after the fire burned,  screwed down to the desk and they put a ball of twine in it and some  hung from the ceiling. They wrapped up all your meat and everything  you bought at the dry goods store was wrapped in paper and tied with  twine. Mama saved all that twine, made a ball for every kid, every boy  in school and covered it with tongues out of leather shoes then. Men   s  high top shoes had leather tongues and she   d save them and cover the  balls with leather. Then she made every girl a doll for Christmas one  year. And then she   d be Santa Claus coming down the hall. We had a  Christmas tree and little candles that might catch the tree on fire set up  there and stuff, had to be real careful. Then the school kids put on a play.   They even made Daddy a    Sweet Potato King    doll dressed in blue  overalls and wearing a crown. We did not have aluminum foil. We  called it    tin foil.    Juicy Fruit and Spearmint chewing gum came in a  silver foil wrapper. We saved every piece to have a shiny piece of paper  and used it for decorations.      Division of household chores.    We always had to carry in the wood and  the water at night. That was one chore you had to do. My sister and I  usually carried in some wood  for the heater stove in the living room and  the cook stove in the kitchen  and my brother would carry in the buckets  of water.  We always bought a wooden cedar water bucket. It was made  similar to a barrel.      Home remedies.    We didn   t have remedies, but I can remember  everybody done their own remedy, Mama greased everybody. I  remember when I was here on the farm, there was a girl over there  across the road that had a baby and Mama said,    You might as well  38  come and go with me to deliver that baby because you might have to  someday be a midwife you know.    She would go all around the  neighborhood and do all that kind of stuff. I remember going over there  one time with her when I lived up here on the farm during the  Depression years.  Then you bought stuff in a bottle with the cork in the top of it. If you  didn   t wash out your bottle and take it back to the drug store, you  couldn   t have a refill. You had to save that glass bottle. So I save bottles,  Mama saved bottles, I still save bottles of junk I don   t need. Some are  setting there on top of the cabinet. But I remember at Mama   s I was sick  when Romeyn was born, I was sick about three months and they never  did know what was wrong with me. Mama thought I had Scarlet Fever I  was sick so long. I had milk leg and all that junk with him too. Had to  wear my left leg bandaged for years after and old grandma shoes with a  shoe string to tie up to walk with because my leg was swelled so bad. I  laid in that bed, that bed I told you her  Hortense   s mother  daddy gave  her for a wedding present in 1907, and after he was born, for some  reason I took this sickness, fever or something. I did not remember  anything. I laid there for I think about three months before I got well and  knew  before taking him home, to Asher, Oklahoma , that I could take  care of him.  Mama asked the doctor   then we had young doctors, didn   t have old  doctors, they had all died and the only doctors we had was new doctors  that was going to little towns to internship or something and then they   d  go on to a bigger town to make money. This doctor lived in Stroud, had  a business there and he came out to take care of me and I can remember  one time, well, he put me on buttermilk. Mama would churn the butter  and she brought me a glass of buttermilk with butter floating in it, I can  remember seeing that. Your pills were put in little pasteboard boxes, a  little box about 2 and a half inches long and about an inch square, and  that box was so full of capsules of pills that they couldn   t even put the  lid down on it. Gosh. That   s when I guess I began to come to. Mama had  bought a new cotton mattress, they were only about four inches thick  then. She had bought a new cotton mattress and had it on that bed that I  was laying on whenever he was born and she moved it over in this  corner of the house after he was born it was in that corner.  Then we had also the rural telephone and the only telephone was out of  Davenport. Stroud didn   t have any out here and it came as far as our  house. It didn   t go any farther south. And everybody came to our house  to turn the crank on the telephone that will ring it, and I finally gave that  to my great granddaughter when she got married, that telephone, I still  had it.  39  This new mattress, I can remember sweating. I guess I just sweat  terrible; I don   t remember sweating but I remember freezing to death.  I   d have her bring me a towel and I   d wrap it around my neck, and then  put it all around me and that   d just be wringing wet. She   d change it and  I got cold when it got wet and she   d bring another one. Mama said when  I got better, after three or four or five weeks went by or something,  because he was about three months old before I took him and went back  home to live. She said,    You sit up in the chair and I   ll turn the mattress  over and everything and make up your bed and make it feel better.    She  turned that mattress over and it was mildewed on the bottom; that   s how  much I sweat. She couldn   t believe it. She said,    If I   d have known that,  I   d have bought a n oil cloth  table cloth and put under the sheets so you  wouldn   t have ruined them.    But that ruined that cotton mattress.  Mattresses were all cotton in those days  and tufted together with a  hand-rolled sewn edge .  We used to make our own cotton mattresses too. The home  demonstration ladies when they   and I was living at Seminole then, had  just gone back to work I guess. And county agents, the government  furnished the bale of cotton and the farm women, the home  demonstration women met in each other   s homes once a month and had  dinner and they quilted for each other or had the lesson in the afternoon,  ate dinner, everybody brought something. They made these cotton  mattresses. The government, I guess during the Roosevelt time or  something, furnished a bale of cotton and the women took that cotton  and patted it out and made it and beat it out with a stick or something  and Mama gave me the needle, it was about that long, that they sewed  through that cotton with a twine and you put a tuff of cotton under the  top part where you sewed it back. It was a tick,    cause Mama gave me a  tick that was sewed up one time. I remember that. It was striped, blue  and white striped ticking. Now the government furnished all that for the  country farm women and they made their own mattresses during that  time  Depression . That needle burned up over there in the fire. I  remember that. But that   s part of the home demonstration agent teaching  lessons. Mama   s sister ended up down at Wagoner County.  She was a  home demonstration agent and moved to whatever county the  government sent her to, to teach farm women.   Saturday afternoon Daddy loved his homemade ice cream. Every  summer we invited everybody in the neighborhood and they came to our  house and we would sit out on the backdoor step and take a gunny sack  and put a hundred pounds of ice in it and take a sledgehammer and beat  the ice up and then dip it up and put it in a freezer. Mama learned to  make ice cream out of cooked eggs and corn starch and made a custard  like thing and put pure cow   s milk and pure cream in it and oh, that was  the richest and best ice cream you ever ate. That was really good. All the  40  sharecroppers and neighbors and kids and everybody came and we   d  have that on Saturday nights. Daddy loved to do that. He   d go to town  and buy that hundred pounds   Stroud had an ice plant then. I   ve been  trying to get somebody to put an antique shop in it, it   s still standing. I  said,    That would make the best antique shop.    It   s next door to the  old   depot and that   s one block south of Main Street in Stroud, which would  be 2nd street and Stroud   s 3rd street.  But that building is a cement building that they made the ice in and the  dock   s still there and then a room on this end, Richard Evans had bought  it and the men would come down and have coffee every morning in the  caf   and he walked across the street and a car hit him and he died. I  drove by there the other day and it   s still setting there. I wish somebody  would come in and put an antique shop in there. That   d be the best place  for history and everything of that sort. Oh, I   d love to see that. Got two  or three on Main Street, but that one sets down there. It   s got a brick  sidewalk, the street is brick that goes down to that because that was the  depot in the main part of town and a big hotel  where my husband  bought our first dresser  was on this northeast corner and the depot was  on the south side next to the railroad track, ice house was just east of it.  When I lived here on the farm, I didn   t have any furniture. A bed  probably and a rocking chair was all I had in the front room. I had a  daybed that you folded up, the top came up and the front went down and  at daytime it was a daybed, at night you let them down and raised that up  and that was your bed you slept on. My aunt gave me that when I got  married. That was our only furniture I had in the front room. Well my  husband and my daddy, we had a car and Daddy didn   t have one then,  and so they would go to town on Saturday. The roads was real muddy  and they   d go up to the old 66 highway, and when they got in town,  there was a lot of people down at the depot area and Daddy said,    Let   s  go down here and see what   s going on.    So they did and they were  selling everything out of that depot hotel. The people went to California  or somewhere and it was just setting there and they came back and sold  the building and all this stuff out. What you did, my husband said was  you went in and whatever you wanted, you pulled it out, brought it out  on the front porch and auctioned it off. My husband got that dresser for  50 cents, I didn   t have a dresser. And it burned up over there in that  house too. That was the prettiest dresser, had a great big mirror, bigger  than that TV on it, it was a bigger dresser than that. I guess it was solid  walnut, it was a beautiful thing, plain modern, as modern as it could be.  Now I watch the antique show and I kind of wonder what it would   ve  been worth. But that   s the way they were auctioning off, the auctioneer,  you   d go  find  what you wanted and pull it out. And I still went to the  county extension at Chandler and got literature and did things here on  the farm when I moved back here too.  41  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  We didn   t ever go to town to church or anything but every once in  awhile   oh I grew up when the country school, all the churches in town  would come out to try to save everybody in the country I guess. They   d  hold two week revival meetings. We   d go to the woods and cut poles  and put poles out then they   d put poles across the top and then cut the  brush and put it over the top and you had a brush arbor. Then Daddy  would go to the lumber company and they   d volunteer and give you 2 X  4   s, 2 X 12   s to sit for seats and they   d cut stumps and put them down  for the seats and put these boards on them. Of course, that was  advertising the lumber company pretty good and then you took the  lumber back whenever the revival ended. Every two weeks all summer  we   d have every denomination you could think of come to church down  here. So it don   t matter to me what church I belong to, I listened to all of  them growing up. We had a lot of what they called holy rollers then.  Everybody shout and sing and dance and fall on the floor and all that  junk that went on, gosh. And that   s the kind of church   and we didn   t  go to town because you had to drive, it was seven miles going around  each section line like that and get in the wagon and everything and go,  we just didn   t do that.  And there were always farm chores to do.   The area around the farm is just cattle and hay now. And then pecans.  My husband, there   s a lot of pecan trees on this, and this orchard right  here he set out when it was little, put out little trees out there and they   re  big trees now and that orchard, my daddy put that one on the corner up  there as you all go back out at my brother   s part and he set that orchard  out, I don   t remember when. But Mama   s brother said,    Grover, you   ll  never live long enough to see these pecans produce.    But he did, he  lived to be 91 and that pecan grove had produced for several years.  Well, you   ve covered just about everything on there.  How do you see the farm through the next 100 years? It   s going to go  down to the fourth generation now or fifth maybe, I don   t know. So he   Romeyn  owns it now and I just stay here. I said,    That   s my house, I   m  going out there to live till I die.    So I   m here. (Laughs)  This has been great. We appreciate you letting us hear your stories.  I   ve been intending to write all this. After two or three weeks ago I heard  that from Tulsa Times on channel 13 and I thought,    Lord, I got so much  history about this Indian junk and everything I could write a book.    And  I thought,    I need to write that and let them know.       Cause it   s mostly  Indian that they   re doing now, Reflections or something I believe they   re  calling it on channel 13. I was glad to hear you all was coming to do this  because that saved me writing it down. But when I went over this  outline, I thought,    Boy, I can write a whole book on this.    I started  42  Finchum  Ninness  Finchum  Ninness  reading it and I got through about half of this and then I didn   t, I don   t  know what   s on the next page, I didn   t read it. See I didn   t even get a  third of the way through this. I spent Mother   s Day at his house. Oh, by  the way I told you I got the oldest Mother   s Day present at church,  didn   t I? I have for about the last four or five years. All those little  statues and things and the other one   s still in the car out there. They gave  me a  25 gift certificate at Wal-Mart this year. But all those baskets up  there have been Mother   s Day baskets with flowers and things in them,  different things that I   ve been getting   they give the youngest mother  and the oldest mother.    Hortense, come on down here,    they don   t even  ask ages any more, the preacher kind of knows me. He   s kind of cute, he  said this year,    How old are you Hortense?    I said,    I   m not going to tell  you.    He said,    You   re 96.    (Laughs) He knew just exactly how old, two  more months I   ll be 97.  You   re doing great.  Yeah, I   m kind of proud of myself. I   m still driving my car and I go  on   I told my son, they all want me to quit driving, I said,    As long as I  know the right side from the left side of that road, I   m going to drive that  car as long as it   s running.    That   s a 19 and 84  model Chevrolet  Impala .  And what a stop sign is.  Yeah, I know stop signs and all. Oh yeah, somebody told him that I did  not, he came out here and told me and said,    Mama, you   re going to  have to be careful what you   re doing.    I don   t know who told him, he  wouldn   t tell me. But they said I   d run a stop sign in Stroud and when I  got across it I ran off the road. I said,    That   s a darned lie, I never did  run a stop sign in my life.    And then later, the next week, somebody told  me about somebody and then they said,    I saw you in town last week.    I  said,    I was not in town.    So there is another car that looks as bad as  mine does and I don   t know who they are, I have no idea. But I go quilt,  my neighbor one mile over here died, she belonged to the Methodist  Church in Stroud. And nobody quilts any more; old people are the only  ones that quilt, young ones all have a job and they don   t know how,  haven   t learned. And I thought,    I can go take that lady   s place.    I   d  already visited on   they did do it twice a week   Fridays and Tuesdays.  Tuesday that church cooks meals for the Lion   s Club and on Friday we  took our lunch and if you came on Tuesday you got to eat with them  whatever was leftover. So I said that woman died and she belonged to  that church and she went there and quilted and I had met her and then  five or six maybe was  quilting  then where they used to have 12 or 13.  So I went up and took her place and I   ve been going I think three years  now. We   ve had another one die and another one that got blind and had  43  Finchum  Ninness  Addendum  7/21/09  to go to the nursing home and another one that fell downstairs and broke  her shoulder and in a nursing home, she was 104 just died a little while  ago. There   s only two or three coming now to quilt, counting me. And  when my brother got sick I told my nieces, I said,    I   ll go up and stay  with your mother while you   re taking care of your daddy,    so I called  them, I said,    I don   t know when I   ll be back, my brother   s got cancer  and I   m going to be taking care of him and I don   t know when I   ll come  back.    But I stayed two weeks and I got a sinus infection on this whole  side of my head. She had a pecan tree and a cedar tree right at the front  door and I don   t know whether that   s what     Yeah, those cedar will do it to you.  Yeah. And tree pollen   s what   s been high right now  according to TV. I  watch channel 9 with Gary England. My husband   s mother   s name was  English .  -------  -------  Mrs. Ninness provided the following additional written comments after  reviewing the interview transcript. The comments appear in a diary form  with accompanying entry dates.  I will try to tell you a very important part of my history I should not  have forgotten. It goes about where when my grandfather died and my  dad went squirrel hunting with his gun, to make a living for he and his  mother and maybe older brothers. (Don   t    know the year the Frisco RR  was put through this area) The older brother, Uncle Lou (Lewis) Royer,  being 20 years older than Daddy. Daddy was eight or nine. I said nine,  my sister said eight. Someday I will get a copy of Clematis Cemetery  rolls (from the caretaker now) and see or write vital statistics at  Oklahoma City for a copy, to see.  He  her grandfather  was born May 18, 1888 at Winfield, Kansas. The  homestead run was 1898. The Indian Chief   s wife died  and he moved  out of the brick house . My grandmother lived here in the Chief   s home  soon after. Grandma, Nancy Ann (Fox) Royer, from near Peoria, Illinois.  Israel Royer was here during the Run of fall 1898. The Chief had given  him the house and all the land around it  before the government decided  to include the property in the 1898 Land Run . He went to Creek Nation  (two miles east) and made the run and homesteaded it in 1898. How  long the period of time was, I do not know. I wish I did. Maybe someday  I will do research and find out.  Oh, what I started to tell you, by my grandmother being good friends of  the Chief, he gave her a job of cooking at their agency school, I do not  44  know how many years, maybe until it was disbanded and no more  agency was there, only crumbling down buildings. The big building  where my grandmother cooked was still there when my husband came  from Illinois, about Christmas 1928 or 1929. When we began courting  we   d drive around in his 1928 Ford roadster with a back    jump seat.     We courted by walking and seeing all the old buildings. I saw the huge  cast iron kitchen cook stove my grandmother, perhaps, cooked  thousands of meals on. We climbed the lovely stairs to the upstairs (I  guess the girls dormitories). Maybe the bottom floor was a huge dining  room.  I am going to tell you about our sharecropper who died. He and his wife  had three boys, about the ages of us three kids. His wife was a snuff  dippin    tiny little woman whose ancestors came on the Trail of Tears.  She had a husband who was a large man to begin with. In those days a  lot of folks made their own coffin. Some decorated inside with silk and  batting, etc. Some kept them in their attic in anticipation of the day when  they   d be used. Sometimes, the neighborhood carpenter, or just men of  the community, built one when it was needed for a friend or neighbor.  Well, this large man died. I don   t know what from. I was rather young,  maybe nine or ten. Anyway, I can see in my mind all the set-up. Then  the body was kept in the home. Most furniture, it was sparse, was moved  out of the living room, only a few straight back chairs, some with cane  bottoms and some with a rope seat woven across in lieu of the one just  worn out and maybe some baling wire put from one leg to the other  underneath, from opposite, corner to corner, legs and the wire tightened,  by twisting a small piece of wood or bigger nail, twisted over and over,  until the wires became firm and the legs held the rungs in, after a dab of  Le Pages glue was put in the hole before inserting the rung. Maybe a  seamstress housewife, or a Christmas gift from a friend, had made a  cushion for the seat.  Here come a few, two or three or even four (sometimes more) just to  visit, then go home leaving at least three or four to    sit up    for the night.  This was to assure no cats or cats came in at night to satisfy a hungry  appetite off the unsuspecting corpse lying peacefully in the fresh, new  lumber homemade coffin. Such was this man. For some reason I do not  know why he had not yet been buried. Maybe the ground was too hard  or it was clay and sometimes the gravediggers hit rock. Anyway, that  poor, unconscious man lay there, peacefully, getting bigger by the day.  My mother said,    We are going to have to hunt up a rope and tie his  coffin shut or he is going to bust and be all over the place.    I can still see  that one inch rope and the knots holding that flat board lid tight down on  that square box with a crack already in it (between the lid and the boards  45  that built the side of the coffin). I do not remember anything else, not of  the burial services, songs, where buried. Only that he was about to bust  open and the big heavy rope holding the lid shut.  Thought you might enjoy the story. A bit of trivia a long time ago.  When Mama   s dad died his wife bought plots at the Stroud, Oklahoma  cemetery (the new one). It   s just across the road on the west side of the  old one (original cemetery). Buried him in the northwest corner. She  gave the lots to her daughter, my mother, and we still have them. She  sold the horses, all surplus equipment and went to Edmond (Central  State College), purchased a home on E. Ayers Street. Right across the  street from the main building with the bell tower and north of the  Thompson   s bookstore,  which is  still there. Her home was the end of  town to the north. She took in girl roomers and she had a cow, garden,  chickens, to make a living and college educate her youngest four  children.  The oldest son was already a school teacher. His wife, Aunt Myrtle,  gave me his little box (about 8 x 10 x 2   ) with his teaching certificate. If  you passed the teaching exam when you graduated out of the eighth  grade, you got a lifetime teaching certificate. The box had his woven  string necktie (about an inch wide) of gold with edges woven in brown.  There was a gold initial    H    tie stick pin, a tiny ink bottle with ink and a  pen staff, and a pen point in it. Necessities of a school teacher.  We had a water well pump on the corner of our school ground. We loved  to go carry a pail of water into the schoolhouse, for our inside drinking  water. Usually two got to go together to carry a pail of water in. Of  course we had a dipper everyone drank from. Later on they got that     sanitation    idea and everyone had to bring their own cup. That didn   t  last long. Who wanted to take time to fill a cup, we all wanted to go out  and play. It was recess time. Of course we all had fun playing Annie  Over or baseball. Run  Run  The bell rang lots too soon.  My grandfather (Mama   s dad) was a cowboy when a young man.  Mama   s brother, Uncle Raymond, told me when I asked him,    wonder  how he came to be a cowboy,    being from Missouri, he said, when the  gold mines were being dug, they were using the smallest mules they  could find. Horses were too big for the tunnels. They learned they could  buy small mules, donkeys, in Illinois. They   d drive them through to the  west. When they came through Missouri, they hired young men on their  way west to help drive the small mules there. He got a job helping to  drive them west. Learned of cattle drives out west and soon became a     cowboy    for all his young life.  46  July 23, 2009  My grandfather (Mama   s dad) was a cowboy when a young man, all  over Texas. When the cattle were driven to Kansas City to market, they  received their pay and he went home to Missouri until time to go     cowboying    again. Met my grandmother, married and there they  stayed.  By the way, my great-grandmother    disinherited    her. They did that a lot  in those days. I can tell you of two other of our neighbor families who  did that to their daughters. One of their girls grew up with me. They  never did get to see or know their grandparents or cousins and they lived  one mile apart. In those days a man was supposed to be    settled    down,  own a farm or good business, have a home, a good house to take a wife  to when he asked her parents for her hand.  My mother   s sisters graduated from Davenport. I found my Aunt Bessie  Herrin   s photo in the high school   s archives. Later, until her death, she  taught a Spanish class at Classen High in Oklahoma City, OK.  By the way, did you know during the Depression (1930s) the cities  passed a law if you taught school in the city limits (and probably worked  at anything) that you had to live in the city limits? I know because my  uncle, my mother   s brother, was a teacher. They had rented a lovely big  farm home (across the culvert bridge) and had to move because that was  the city limits. They stopped at the bridge. She was so mad. All they  could find was a tiny house on a lot and she had three boys that needed a  big lawn to play on and they had to leave it. That law is still on the  books to this day.  Man, oh, man, have I had a busy 97th birthday today  Telephone calls,  Happy Birthday wishes, today. Gifts and a pecan pie     nuts ground     so  old folks can eat. Man, have I made a pig of myself today  Birthday  cards, signed by lots of friends, etc. and a nice day, 61 degrees, in the  middle of July. Well you don   t have 97 every day   My husband   s grandmother came on the Trail of Tears. She married in  Tennessee and they took the northern route across the southern end of  Illinois. Illinois was a corn growing state and hog raisin    farmers. They  had to have something to eat up the corn they grew. His granddad knew  how to butcher and as they tr
