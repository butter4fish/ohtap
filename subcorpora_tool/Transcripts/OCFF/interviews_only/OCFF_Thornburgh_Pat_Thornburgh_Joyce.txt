 Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Today is October 17, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today  we   re in Helena, Oklahoma, to speak with Pat and Joyce Thornburgh,  and we   re actually going to talk about two different farms today, so the  first one will be the William Logan Metcalf Homestead     Homestead.     Homestead and then the Thornburgh   Farm?  Well, the whole thing is Thornburgh Farms. We   ve moved it together  because of farmland from both families, so we call ourselves  Thornburgh Farms.  Well, let   s start with learning a little bit about the Metcalf part.  Okay.  How did the family get to Oklahoma and get to this     My granddad was William Logan, and he made the Run from Kansas (I  believe from Anthony) and came down and staked this particular quarter  of land because of the spring that flows in the creek down here because  water was and is very important. He proofed it up as required and got the  patent on it, and it   s been in the family ever since.  Was he married when he came?  No, he was not. He married in 1910. He married my grandmother who  was twenty- four  years younger than he was. She also came down from  Kansas, but she was from Ohio. I don   t know from where they came  before that. She was into theater, and she was with a troupe. She had a  5  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  sister that lived down here and was married to an Overstreet, and she  came down to visit the sister who lived just two miles north of here, or  eventually lived two miles north of here. At that time,  the sister  was  living with my grandfather. She and her husband were helping with the  farming, and that   s where my granddad met her. I have a letter that he  wrote back to his aunt in Kansas, saying that, he said,    You wanted to be  here when I get married. Well, you better hurry because I   m getting  married,    (Laughter) and gave the date.  They married and had five children. They were all born here in this  house. Three of them were daughters, and two of the daughters got their  degrees from Northwestern  Oklahoma State University , teaching  certificates. My mother, the youngest, she went to Phillips University for  two years and then went to East Central  University  for a year and then  got married and didn   t finish school. Her brothers, one farmed and went  back into Kansas and farmed the farm that they owned up there before  Granddad moved down here. The other brother farmed here for a while,  and then they went off and had their own professions. How we became  part of this family was my dad met my mother in school, in high school,  and then he went to work for Logan after high school and never left.  (Laughs) He worked for him and fell in love with my mother. My  granddad died in 1947 at the age of eighty     Nine and a half.     eighty-nine and a half. No, that was my dad. My granddad died at  eighty-one. I think he was eighty-one years old.  Oh, right.  My dad bought the farm from my grandmother in  1948  with the  understanding that she got a third of the profits as long as she lived.  When she died, he still had a payment to make which went to each of the  kids, divided among the children, and from that, my dad grew the farm  to nine quarters. My granddad was a progressive conservative type. He  owned the first pull combine in Alfalfa County, the first case combine. I  really don   t know how much land he accumulated in his lifetime.  I know during the Depression that he gave some land to neighbors  because they couldn   t make their payments and they wanted to farm, and  so he gave them a quarter of land. Each one of his children he gave a  quarter of land when they married. When they graduated from high  school, they got the income off of it, and then when they married, they  got the land. He also built them a house or gave them savings bonds to  the equivalent of what the house would cost.  6  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Just like a dowry, more or less.  That gave my dad a goal to own so much land so that he could give to  his children. My granddad, one of the things I remember my dad telling  me my granddad said about farming is,    If you have a crop in the field, a  crop in the bank, and a crop in the elevator, you   ll never go broke.    And  that   s true. It will work. That   s still true today even though it   s harder.  We have several crops in the bank, you know, mostly due to the oil  boom, but we do have several crops in the bank at the present time.  There have been hard times through all of it. Even my dad had to work  off the farm to make ends meet at times, worked in the oil fields. Always  made his payments, always made his bank loans, and we   ve done the  same.  So did Mr. Metcalf work off the farm, too, at any time?  No, he did not. I think he was twenty-one when he made the Run, and he  lived on the farm his whole life, never worked off of it.  So if he was twenty-one when he made the Run, and then his wife was  twenty-one years younger, so he must have worked on the farm awhile  before he married     Well, yeah.     or am I getting them mixed up already?  Well, he made the Run in    93, 1893, and he married in 1910.  Okay.  So  he worked  seventeen years  before he married .  She was born  July 9, 1889 . He was born  October 28, 1865 . No, he  did not ever work off the farm.  Any idea what prompted him to make the Run to begin with?  I think the idea of having some free land because I   m not sure in Kansas  that they owned enough land that the family could actually live off of.  He made the Run, and you   ve talked to Mr.  E.L.  Metcalf up here,  my  neighbor . That particular quarter of land, the fellow that made the Run  on it relinquished it the first year. My granddad wrote to his mother and  said,    If you   ll move down here,    because E. L.   s dad was not old  enough,    If you   ll move down here, you can take control of that land.     So his mother came down and his younger brother, and they improved  7  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  on that particular piece of property. At one time when my granddad first  moved down here, he dug a dugout or a cave and lived right down here  off the road in the northeast corner of this  quarter .  Until his home was built in  19 10. He came in  18 93.  That cave was there for quite some time until it became a danger. The  walls started caving in on it, so we pushed it in, but that   s where we  lived when he first came, just built a cave.  His grandmother   s name was Irene Gipson, and that person that had  moved in with William Logan was Fanny Myrtle, who was Irene   s  sister. She was Fanny Myrtle, became an Overstreet. She was Fanny  Myrtle Gipson Overstreet, and they lived with them for a period of time.  Well, when he first came here, besides the dugout, what else did he build  on the farm in those earlier days?  Well, built the barn, a machine shed, a brooder house, which we call the  chicken house. He had a chicken house and had a coal house and two  granaries and a washhouse, and out of those the only one not standing is  the chicken house. The rest of them are still here, not in the best of  shape, but they   re still here. One thing that my granddad did when   he  was terrible at making cement. It was all sand, had no rock in it and very  little wire or anything else for strength. Every time he built something,  he always wrote his initials and usually the date in it. If somebody else  was helping him, their name   s on it, too.  After I found out y   all were coming, I went and started doing   I   d seen  some of those. I started digging and cleaning off some of the cement  work so I could verify that that   s true and how old some of the buildings  were. The latest ones that he built were in 1929, I believe was the last  one he built. He didn   t write it in the foundation. It was always on the  steps. Every one of them had cement floors in them instead of  foundation and dirt floor. The only one that   s not standing is the chicken  house.  Everyone considered him very progressive, and he was, for that era. He  would put in the most modern things it seemed for that time. This house  was supposed to be the first in Alfalfa County that had carbide lights,  and so we considered him a very progressive man.  The water that they used to supply the house came from the spring. I  don   t know whether it was before he built the house, probably after he  built the house, but he dug a hand-dug well just to the southeast of the  house, and we   re elevated from the creek by about twenty feet. The well  8  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  I think was thirty-five foot deep. He dug a trench from the creek to the  house where the spring was and laid a pipe the full length of it with the  sand point on the end of it, and so the water from the creek or the spring  came to the well and supplied water for the house with the windmill.  The two cement tanks you see out here in the driveway that are now  filled, he had his garden to the east of that, and he built a underground  irrigation system with cement pipe.  He   d fill those tanks, and then he   d open them and let them drain, let  water drain underneath the garden into an underground irrigation type  system. The fence, (I don   t know whether you noticed it when you came  in or not) there   s a little fish pond back here to the side of the house. He  had a fence; there was a fenced yard. The fence was made out of pipe,  and water flowed through the top rail of the fence around and supplied  water to the fish pond. He just did things like that, you know, and I wish  we could have preserved all that. We still have the fish pond     The original.     the original, but we don   t have any of fencing. That all rotted and  wasn   t modern enough. It wasn   t hog wire, but it was ornamental wire  fence and gates. We have pictures of the house. My oldest, not the  oldest, but one of my mother   s sisters said the house was as it was when  we moved here, which is two story with a porch and stuff out here. We  have pictures of the house that shows the south side of the house was  actually an addition to the original house. The floor out there slopes to  the south so that if the water overflowed in the wash room, it didn   t flow  into the rest of the house, and it makes it hard for carpenters nowadays  to make anything fit. (Laughter)  How do you think he learned how to do all that or     The house was built   there was three. As a kid I remember there was  this house, Mr. Metcalf   s house, E. L.   s house, and then there was a  Dunsworth house which was just a mile east of here. They were all built  by the same builder. My granddad helped in the design, and he also  helped build all of my aunts    and uncles    houses, his children   s houses.  That was done by contract. This house was built by a contract builder.  All the lumber came from Pond Creek. They had to haul it in here on a  wagon from Pond Creek because that was the only lumber yard at the  time and there was no rail service. The houses were very similar in  design. You   ve seen Mr.  E.L.  Metcalf   s house. The Dunsworth house  was a two-story house built with the wraparound porch just like these  are. It burned in 19-, probably    51. It was unoccupied at the time, but the  Dunsworth house burned. My father bought the land from my  grandmother, and then my dad   I have two sisters. My dad put all the  9  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  land that he owned in a trust and gave each one of us a certain amount of  land. In 1972, my wife and I  came back from Arizona to Oklahoma   and started farming in 1974 full time.  We moved into this house in  19 73, so we   ve lived here for forty-one  years.  And then when you were growing up, did you grow up in this house?  I was born in the Thornburgh homestead and then moved over here in  1949, so I   ve lived here since 1949,  except for four and a half years in  Arizona after Joyce and I married .  And  Pat  was born in  19 43, so he was six when he came here.  In fact, my uncle was a bus driver and he   d pick me up that morning at  the old place and take me to school. We came back, he took me back to  that place and let me out, and there was nobody there. About, I don   t  know, twenty minutes later here the school bus came back and he says,     Oh, I was supposed to take you over to your new house.    (Laughter)  You hear the stories about the son being left and nobody being home?     Where did they go?    I tell that story. I knew where they were, but I  didn   t know they   d moved that day. When I came home from school, I  was supposed to come to this house instead of to the house I was raised  in for the first six years of my life.  This is the original woodwork that was here.  All the windows and all that stuff is the original. We had to redo the  walls because of cracking. It was old lath and mortar. And we   ve put     When we redid the walls, we took off seventeen layers of wallpaper.  They did not remove wallpaper. (Laughter) They just put it over. We   re  lucky that there were even windowsills, you know, the thickness of it,  but we took off seventeen layers with a spray. We just wetted it down  and scraped it off.  That   s a history lesson in itself     Yeah.  It was.     time periods for each one of those.  And I do have pictures of upstairs. When we took it down to the floor,  1 0  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  there was old linoleum under and all that kind of stuff.  They just put the rugs over it. My folks, when they put rugs in the house,  they   d put rugs over the old linoleum, didn   t take it up. I remembered  the linoleum from seeing it when I was a kid, when my grandmother still  lived here.  The things we have had replaced, in 1989 and then again in   92   in    89  in particular we had grapefruit-size hail, and that   s when we re-sided the  home because it had the narrow wooden siding and it just broke it all to  pieces, and it broke most of the windows out. At that time, we replaced  windows and re-sided. Otherwise, it would probably be still wooden  because it was in good shape until it got broken.  So when would it have gotten electricity, before you     We had electricity when we lived here. I think we had electricity over  where I was raised in 1945, when we had electricity. We didn   t have  running water over there. We had a cistern. They had running water here  when we moved here. When my folks moved here and my granddad had  running water, he had a pressurized tank, and the windmill pumped the  water from the well from the spring. He had a tank overhead up on the  windmill about twenty foot and filled that tank, and that   s what gave the  pressure for water to come into the house.  When we first moved over here, when I came over here and visited my  grandparents, they just had an outhouse. They didn   t have indoor  facilities, let   s put it that way. Like my wife said, my granddad was  progressive. He had some of the first carbon lights, one of the first to  have electricity when it came around. He wasn   t afraid of it or anything  like that. He wanted to have it, but he was conservative. He made the  comment to my dad that there will never be a piece of land in this  country worth more than  40,000. Dad said,    The first piece of land I  bought cost almost  40,000, and it   s just gone up since then.    (Laughs)  I think it was in 1921 that electricity came to this house.  I don   t think so. I don   t think it was     I thought that   s when rural electricity came...  Do you know when rural electricity came? I don   t think it was that early.  It was sometime in the   30s, wasn   t it, but I   m not sure.  It may have been earlier than that that we had electricity.  1 1  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  I   d say he got it as soon as he could, just from what you were saying.  He did. As soon as it was available to him, he did. A little more history  on my   there was a schoolhouse at the end of the driveway, and it was  called the Timberlake School District number sixty-nine. It   s where my  mother and all of her brothers and sisters went to school until the eighth  grade, and then they went to Jet High School. My oldest aunt graduated  from Northwestern, and she came back and taught two years at the  school. We have a picture of E. L. and class members, and she was their  teacher. That   s the only pictures we have of that building that we   ve  been able to locate. We   re still looking for some.  It had a teeter-totter, a merry-go-round, and a slide. My dad gave all that  to the Jet Lions Club to put in the Jet playground area, park, with the  understanding that if it was ever taken out that it would come back to the  family. Well, thirty years later, people had forgotten what the deal was,  and it got destroyed, jerked out. I know where the merry-go-round is, but  I have not been able to get the people to let me have it back. It   s still like  it was, just tossed out on the ground, not being used, but they won   t give  it to me. We   d like to have it.  Just for the history. Rural electrification came in    35.  Okay, yes.  Well, what kind of crops did he have in the early days?  Well, in the letter that he wrote to his aunt telling about the wedding to  be, he talked about oats and barley, and he was getting ready to plant  corn. It was very dry. He said,    We   d start plowing if it would just rain.     Then on my father   s side, we have letters talking about the kaffir corn  that they planted and mostly oats and barley and wheat. They make the  comment that one day you can have a very nice, fine, green field of corn,  and the next day hot winds hit it, just like they do now, and it turns to  crispy brown. We evidenced that this year in a lot of the crops,  especially some of the spring crops, the milo. You can just drive around  right now and see some of the milo fields and some of the soybean fields  that are just completely dried up due to hot winds and drought this year.  We had a terrible wheat crop this year. That   s how we came to live here.  We raised two children here.  Let   s back up and talk about the Thornburgh...  The Thornburghs, they made the Run. They came from   what   s the  town north of Ark City  Kansas ?  1 2  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Winfield.  Winfield, Kansas. They lived in Winfield, Kansas, and made the Run.  My great-granddad, whom I did not know, (well, he was still alive I  guess when I was born, but I don   t remember him) made the Run. He  already had a family of five. Only the two youngest were born in  Oklahoma. Actually, the farm that I consider the centennial farm is not  the one he homesteaded. It   s the quarter right north of the one he  homesteaded, and once again, whoever homesteaded it left. My  granddad brought his sister -in-law  down, Celeste Randall, and she took  over the relinquishment. Part of the rules were you had to live on the  land, so my granddad dug a dugout on the half-mile line. They both  lived in the dugout on the half-mile line, so they both lived on the  property and they didn   t have to build two dugouts.  Then my dad   s dad, Ivan Wesley Thornburgh , inherited that land when  his dad, Clarence, died.  Ivan Wesley  married  Wilma  Ackley, and  they had three boys. My granddad, my dad   s dad, died at the age of  twenty-two from a ruptured appendix. My oldest uncle,  Wayne , was  five, my dad was three, and the youngest brother,  Wesley , was two  months old. When he died, when my granddad died, my grandmother  got forty acres of the land, and each of the brothers got forty acres of the  land in the will. When we filled out the original homestead, Centennial  Farm, one of the things when I did the research on it was my  grandmother had twenty-six mortgages against that farm to keep it  viable, and most of them were with the bank in Jet or with other family  members.  I still have some of those liens. Sixteen dollars, I think the largest one  was three hundred dollars. She paid them all off and was able to keep the  land. My dad then bought his mother   s share and eventually bought his  brothers    shares. When my dad started farming, my Granddad,  William  Logan  Metcalf, had given my mother a quarter of land, and then my dad  had a quarter of land. They set up house on the old Thornburgh place,  and from there he grew the farm to  seven  quarters, which I own   three . I   ve bought two, myself, and my sisters, each of them   I own  three that my dad had, and they  each  own  two  quarter s .  Well, did the aunt end up keeping hers, that came down with him, his  sister?  That   s the one   I don   t exactly know how my granddad got that, but  that was part of his inheritance. I   m going to assume that maybe his dad  bought it from his sister. I don   t remember that part of it. All I know is  in 1893 and    94, that   s when she came down and took over the  1 3  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  relinquishment of it. I probably looked at the abstracts, but I can   t  remember exactly how it was given to my granddad. We still farm it.  What kind of crops and things did he do on his land?  Well, one they mentioned was kaffir corn. They mentioned it a lot. Some  of the early history of that family was, we have a picture of the   they  lived in a soddy house for quite a while. I forget what year it was, but  my great-granddad built a two-story house. We have letters telling about  the early years in the old house and how it leaked in the prairie dog holes  and water would run in through the prairie dog holes. They didn   t have  the new house completed, didn   t have the windows in it or anything, but  my great-grandmother pulled a drawer out, and there was a rattlesnake  in it . She said,    We   re moving today,    so they moved that day into the  house even though it didn   t have any windows in it, into a framed house.  My dad   s tried to buy the original homestead, that his great-granddad     but was unable to get it bought. People just won   t sell it. I   m  hoping one of these days they will. I don   t think they will. They   ll  probably outlive me, so I won   t get it bought. They talked mostly corn  and barley, and they raised cattle.  Where would they take their products to market?  Part of them went to Timberlake, the town of Timberlake, which was  located just a few miles from here, over there where you saw the  cemetery. Just north of that was the town of Timberlake, and it was in  existence from 1904, I think, to 1912. We have a paper here somewhere  that lists that the price of wheat was twenty-five cents a bushel, corn was  fifteen cents a bushel, and hogs sold for twenty-five cents a pound. They  had to take them to the guy that owned the local mercantile store. Said  that he didn   t trade in money. He traded in chickens or hogs or whatever  people brought because they didn   t have any cash, so they just bartered.  He said once a week they   d load up whatever they bartered for, take it to  Pond Creek and sell it, and bring back produce from the mercantile  store. So that was the price of things back then.  The town of Timberlake disappeared when the railroad went through Jet,  went through Helena, and bypassed Timberlake. They called it  Timberlake because of artesian ponds that were there, and that was part  of the Cimarron Trail, one of the stops for the cattle on the Cimarron  Trail. It got its name from a family that ranched by the name of  Timberlake, and their brand is a    TL.    That   s the brand my father uses  and I still use for Thornburgh. It doesn   t mean anything, but it   s ironic  that it   s the same brand.  We went to church there (it was the United Methodist Church of  1 4  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  Timberlake) while I was a kid. Then we started going to Jet to school.  We have some of the history of that church. The first church burned  after two years and had a bell. Most of the churches then had bells. It  burned after two years, and they rebuilt it within two weeks and put the  bell back up in it. In 1964 that church burned, and so they moved the  church into the parsonage. The bell was cracked from the heat and from  the fall, and they put it on a cement slab and put a plaque on the front of  it that said,    In Memory of the Pioneers of Timberlake Church.     Somebody stole the bell, and they tried to steal the plaque.  My dad bought that little particular piece of property for my sister, who  was going to live there, and transfer the parsonage into a home. She got  divorced, and that didn   t happen. They started working on it, but I tore  the building down and used part of it to fix things up around here. Then  we salvaged the plaque. They tried to steal it, and they broke it in half. It  was a marble thing and engraved, and we have it in our backyard. We  took it over to a monument place in Alva, and he cemented it back  together for us. It   s missing one little corner. When they cracked it they  didn   t want it, so we still have it.  We can show it to you later.  Yeah. We   ve always been Christian people. I grew up in the Christian  Church at Jet. She grew up in the Church of Christ. When we were  married and moved here, we started going to the Church of Christ in  Helena, raised our kids in the church. I   m not sure my Granddad Metcalf  ever went to church. He was a honest, good Christian man, but I don   t  think he attended church. My grandmother went to church every time  there was a meeting. The school, when it closed, the Timberlake school  down here at the end of the driveway, it became the Timberlake Ladies  Aid. We had picnics, and they met once a month and quilted and did all  those things there. I have three desks that I believe came out of that  school. My dad tore that school down when I was in college in Arizona  because it just deteriorated, and I believe those desks came out of that  school. We don   t have them here at the house. We had fun times as kids  down there because we went down there and played on the playground  equipment when I was growing up.  You could walk there?  It was a quarter mile.  It was at the end of this driveway.  So not far, sure.  1 5  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  It was called two things. In one of the papers that I read, it was referred  to as the Tucker School, but it was actually, legally, the Timberlake  School District number 69. It was a one-room school.  Now the high school is called Timberlake. They assumed that name. I  don   t know how they decided on that name for the new school. Irene, his  grandmother, would make the lunches for all the school kids (it was a  one-room school house through the eighth grade) for the longest time,  and then later she would prepare the lunch and take it down.  The three oldest brothers and sisters graduated at the same time, and my  mother and her older brother, the two youngest, graduated at the same  time. My mother wasn   t supposed to be in school, but she threw such a  fit that they let her go. Then she and my dad graduated from high school  at the same time.  And where would that have been from?  Jet.  Jet. And where did   did you go to Jet, as well?  I went to Jet, graduated from Jet. My kids went to Jet school until they  were   then they consolidated with Nash, and it was Jet-Nash schools.  Then after they graduated, it became Jet-Nash-Goltry-Helena and  became Timberlake schools, which is a good thing and a bad thing. It  caused some deterioration in the towns that didn   t have the schools, and  people lost interest in community things. They still have a grade school  at Jet and the high school   or the middle school at Jet, and the grade  school and high school are in Helena. Nash does not have a school, and  Goltry does not have a school now, and so those two communities     Population really went down, as you can imagine.  Well, when did the Timberlake one here on the property close?  As a school? I don   t     Before you came     We married in 1967.  Before I was     Even born?  1 6  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh     even born. I don   t know what the   I   m sure I could go over to  Cherokee and look in the archives and find out when it closed. E. L.  graduated from it, and he   s eighty-four. He may have been one of the  last ones to graduate from it. I really don   t know.  Probably. The first time I came here was in 1965, and I can remember  down there, there was a corner that wasn   t tilled. They didn   t really farm  it because there were still cement stones from the school there. Then  later, of course, that was cleaned up and torn down.  I think my dad tore that down in    68 or    69. When we moved over here,  they were holding Timberlake Church Ladies Aid community picnics.  Some of the things we did as kids, there was a Fish   s park. I don   t know  whether anybody   s mentioned Fish   s park. Just south of here two miles  was an artesian well and a swimming pool, a cement swimming pool  that a family had built, and as a kid that   s where all the family reunions  were even when I was still in high school. I guess maybe two years after  I graduated, which would   ve been in    61, it closed because they couldn   t  maintain the health regulations that the state had put on them and they  couldn   t afford to update it to do that.  As a kid that   s where we always had our family reunions and always had  our picnics, Fourth of Julys, were always at Fish   s park. The people that  owned it were named Fish; the Fish family owned it. They had the same  type of playground equipment as we had at the school at the end of the  driveway. In fact, I went down there to see if I could salvage some of it  to repair and replace what we   d lost up here, and time had taken its toll  on it. That   s where we always went. If we had a church picnic or class  party, we went to Fish   s park.  You can tell that it was a beautiful place, but by the time I ever went  there, it was just brambled up, just was deteriorated.  My folks went there as kids. It was there when my mother was young.  The smaller towns used to offer so much more to the kids than it does  now. I mean there were movie houses, there were all kinds of things to  do such as that, being so local for rural kids. Now in Jet there is a  swimming pool for the kids, but it   s sad to lose beautiful places like that,  I think.  So when you were younger, what kind of chores would you have around  the farm?  One I hated the most was milking. (Laughter) It seemed like I didn   t  really mind it in the wintertime, but in the summertime it was   there  1 7  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  wasn   t any aeration. It was just whatever breeze blew through. I   d rather  have been on the tractor, but my dad would say,    Somebody   s got to go  do the milking.    We only had two cows, and later only one cow. I  devised ways to tie the tail of the cow back so that she couldn   t swat me  with her tail. (Laughter) I just hated that and   I didn   t hate it. I disliked  it, but it was beneficial. We churned our own milk and separated. We  had the separator, and that was part of the job of milking. You brought  the milk up, and then you put it through the separator and took the cream  off of it and kept the milk.  Biggest challenge for me was keeping the cow from stepping in the  bucket, and if she did, I sometimes didn   t tell them. I just went ahead  and separated it. We had filters, cloth filters, in it. When we got to where  we didn   t use as much milk, I started feeding bottle calves. That was part  of my income as grade school and high school was I   d buy bottle calves,  calves that have lost their mothers. We   d buy them at the sale for four or  five dollars a head, and I   d raise them on buckets. I got whatever they  brought whenever we sold them. I got the income off of it.  We had chickens. My full four years in high school, I raised Leghorn  hens. I harvested eggs and took them to the local creamery in Helena. I  had to clean them, candle them, pack them, and then I   d take them down  there and sell them to it. That was my spending money in high school to  buy gas if I got to use the car, and that   s the only money I got. You had  to earn your keep. My dad just didn   t give you money for things. You  had to earn it. I mentioned the brooder house. We raised our own  broilers. Every year Dad would buy a hundred chicks, babies, two days  old, a day or two days old, and we   d raise those and butcher them, store  those and freeze them. We canned our own vegetables.  Where did you freeze them to store? Did you have your own, or was  there a locker in town or whatever?  No, we had electric freezers, electric freezers. Even when we moved  back here and started farming, we raised our own broilers. We had a few  chickens and geese and ducks mostly for the kids. We always had big  gardens, but when it became you could buy food cheaper than you could  raise it, we quit. She didn   t particularly like butchering.  When we first moved back, we would always raise a hundred broilers,  and during harvest, of course, the main meal in the field would be fried  chicken. Every day when those were big enough, we would go out, and  we would kill ten chickens each day because you couldn   t process that  many, or I couldn   t. I did that for years when we first were married. You  wanted to raise your children almost the same way you were raised  because you think good ethics, earn your money, that kind of thing.  1 8  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  That   s the reason we had a milk cow for a while when we were first  married. We had the chickens. We had, like he said, the ducks and things  more to teach them the same thing that we knew.  I don   t think my son ever milked a cow. (Laughs)  Brian didn   t milk the cow.  I don   t think he ever milked the cow.  You always did the milking.  I think I got rid of the cow before   I just didn   t put him through what I  went through. Besides that, he was allergic to milk, so the incentive to  milk wasn   t there because it made him sick.  I used to can when we had the big garden. I would can for years, and  then, like he said, you just started realizing it was not worth that and quit  doing it.  How would you butcher your chickens? Did you have a particular     He would cut their heads off. Then I would pick the feathers.  When we first started, as a kid I remember with my parents, we   d just  cut their heads off and let them flop around until they bled out, and  scalded them and picked them. Then I think, actually, I   m the one that  came up with the idea of, why not, we had two pear trees out here beside  the chicken house, and I strung a wire between them and put loops of  twine on it. Then I   d hang them by their feet...  He was as barbaric as it comes, believe me.     and cut their head off and let them hang there and bleed out right there  instead of flopping all over and getting blood all over everything and a  lot of the grass on them.  More practical approach.  Yeah.  To this day, though, fresh chicken, there is a totally different taste than  what you buy in the grocery store. It is much, much better. It   s more  tender.  She finally reached the point that she didn   t like     1 9  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  No     doing that anymore, and you could buy them cheaper than you could  feed them, anyhow, even though it wasn   t as good.  It   s funny because is in this day and time, I have a niece that is raising  her own chickens because of organic and the health of it, so maybe it   ll  come back.  We still raise our own beef and butcher. I don   t do the butchering, but  what beef we eat is homegrown. That way we know what they   re fed.  And did your parents or grandparents do hogs?  Yes, I can remember my dad when we lived over at the old home place,  the Thornburgh place, that we had salted hog sides hung out in the  granary. Whenever Mom said,    We   re out of meat,    Dad would go out  there and slice off some more. I can remember those hanging in the  granary, the hams and the hocks and such.  Not a smokehouse.  Not a smokehouse. They were salted.  Did your grandmother and mother belong to homemaker clubs and  maybe     My mother belonged to a HD club, home demonstration club, and I  think Joyce did for a while. My grandmother maybe belonged to Grange,  but that wasn   t like a home   . She belonged to what they called Ladies  Aid. They canned and made quilts, and, in fact, we still have some of the  quilting frames that she used. My parents were not big on keeping old  stuff when they remodeled, like the carbide lights. They were just tossed  out somewhere and are gone.  I do have a vacuum sweeper that belonged to my grandmother that had  the bellows in them, stored. I haven   t looked at it for twenty years, I  don   t suppose. We had a press for squeezing grapes and such to get the  juice out of them. It may have been used for rendering lard, I   m not sure.  I know my Grandmother Thornburgh made chitlins and made her own  soap and such that way. I know my grandmother did, too, because we  have some letters here, or some memoirs that my aunt wrote that talked  about making their own soap.  Extension clubs really have their time and place in rural communities. I  2 0  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  belonged to it probably for twelve or thirteen years. It became not what I  think it was supposed to be in that we did so much for fairs and things  like that, that it became a competition instead of just the learning  process, and so I gave it up at that point. I didn   t want to do that  anymore.  We gave up the showing of livestock because it became more of a,     How much money can you spend and go out and buy the best    instead  of raising your own and showing your own. It became something you  just couldn   t compete with. It wasn   t teaching the kids the proper thing.  We had families that could hardly afford to put meat on their table, but  they   d go out and buy a thousand-dollar steer to win. That was the only  reason they   d do it     And that was the cost then, not now. It would be much more now.     just to win. We said,    That   s not teaching our kids the right thing,    so  we quit doing that.  Our son showed cattle through his senior year. I mean, we participated.  Through 4-H, FFA?  FFA     FFA and 4-H.     and 4-H. They belonged to both 4-H and FFA.  Tremendous programs. I can   t commend   4-H and FFA was wonderful.  To this day, our son   s forty-three now and works down, still in  Oklahoma. He lives in Chickasha, but he comments about how many  people through FFA he knows statewide, that he   ll run into somebody  else that,    Yeah, I remember you.    It   s a good program on leadership  everything, being able to speak in front of people, that kind of stuff,  good programs.  Were you in 4-H when you were in high school?  Yes.  So was I, in Houston. (Laughs)  I showed hogs. I didn   t show any cattle. I didn   t like sheep. They stunk,  even worse than   hogs might stink worse, but the oil on the sheep, once  you got that on you, you couldn   t get it off, on your hands or on your  2 1  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  clothes. I showed them one year, and I said,    That   s enough for me.    It   s  not worth the effort. I never did show cattle. I just showed hogs.  At the county fair or the state fair?  Local, county, and I went to state once. I took my hogs down there, and  they got sifted. Didn   t even make the show ring. I went out for lunch,  and I came back and went to take care of my pigs, and they were gone. I  said,    What happened?    Well, they got sifted. When they get sifted they  go straight to market, and you don   t get told. You just find them not  there. I was on judging team, FFA judging team. I tried to be on the  meat judging team, but I wasn   t very good at it, but I was on livestock  judging team for a couple of years.  And our son was, too.  Yeah.  Went to state in the...  He showed at the district his last year. He kept wanting to show cattle,  and said,    You just can   t compete.    His last year, I said,    All right, you  can spend more than what the market price is,    because that   s all I   d let  him spend on an animal was market price. I said,    This is your senior  year. You can spend more on it but just don   t go overboard.    He showed  a Hereford steer that took Reserve Champion in Enid, and he took it on  to Oklahoma City and didn   t even place. He was so disheartened. I was  glad it was his senior year because he probably wouldn   t have done it  again. But that   s just     Part of it.      just part of it. That   s competition, and one judge is totally different  from another, what they like and what they don   t like. At that time, you  could paint your hogs. If the color didn   t show up just perfect, you could  paint them, or you could oil them down, and you cut the hair. Now you  can   t do any of that stuff. It   s supposed to be just on the quality of the  animal. You can   t fluff the wool to make it look thicker, or you can   t  paint the hog, which is the way it should be.  Paint the hog.  Really, paint. (Laughter)  If you had a Poland China  breed  and the black on the markings weren   t  just really good on it, you could paint it black.  2 2  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  Using what? Shoe polish or what?  Just spray paint.  They used it on everything. (Laughter)  They used it on white pigs. We   d powder them with white powder. Slap  them in the ring, and the powder would fly off of them. I think the senior  year that my son was in school, all the hogs had to be shaved down to  the skin so they couldn   t hide anything with hair. Same with the sheep.  All the sheep had to be the same way. You couldn   t block them. They  had to be sheared so just the animal, just confirmation showed. You  couldn   t enhance or hide.  Did they ever go to Roundup in Stillwater, 4-H Roundup?  You know, I don   t remember. I think my daughter might have. I don   t  think my son did. He went to several leadership things, like the Hugh  O   Brian  Youth  Leadership Foundation in Oklahoma City. He went to  that a couple of years and was a mentor for a couple of years after. Did  that his junior and senior year in high school, and then the first two years  in college they called him and asked him back to be a mentor for the  next two years. Rural education, you can   t beat it, individualized  teaching. You don   t get the best teacher sometimes, but you get the  individual, individuality, and more one-on-one time. I think it   s a better  deal.  It was a unique time. I think our kids grew up at a wonderful time as far  as the education part of it goes because, I don   t know, all of the parents  cared immensely in our kids    class. I can   t speak for the other classes,  but I don   t know. We were just so behind our kids in education. Our  teachers cared about our kids, knew everything about them. If they did  anything wrong, we would get a call, saying,    What   s the matter with  the attitude?    Or anything, if they did well, telling us. It was a golden  time, I think, compared to now.  We   ve talked a little bit about work. What would you do for fun, besides  going swimming at the Fishes   ?  Besides going swimming?  Yeah.  Oh, as a kid?  2 3  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  As a kid.  Well, we made our own fun. We had certain willow trees that we would  swing on, and, of course, we had the creek. At that time, it flowed quite  a bit. It even had fish in it that made their way up from the lake because  this particular creek flows into the Great Salt Plains Lake up here and  whenever it would flood, the fish would come upstream. The neighbor  girl and I were fishing in our creek down there, and she caught a five-pound  channel cat out of the creek. We went and put it in her tank.  Mostly we created our own fun, you know. I had two sisters. We just  played. We learned how to play outside.  We didn   t have the distraction of TV. We had a TV when they first came  out, but the reception was so terrible you didn   t watch much of it. You  learned how to entertain yourself, and we had a lot more company as  kids. The other kids would come over on weekends. I had an aunt and  uncle that my parents liked to play cards with, Bridge mostly. They had  a couple of children, and we   d play football in the front yard and the  lights or baseball, but we always found ways to have fun. We didn   t  have handheld computers and phones like this, and so you learned how  to entertain yourself. Growing up, (I don   t know how my father did it)  we took a vacation every summer for ten days to two weeks either to  Colorado or to Wyoming. Since we   ve been married, we have bigger  equipment, not farming a whole lot more ground, but we don   t seem to  find time to do those things.  It   s hard to get away.  I don   t know why. Well, I do know why.  We do know why.  We finally figured it out. We do know why. We don   t have any family  left to look after the place while we   re gone. My dad always had uncles  around, or we had close neighbors that would look after things. Now I  don   t have a son here to stay if I want to go somewhere. I don   t have any  neighbors, any uncles or aunts or cousins that would do things for you,  and it   s just a whole different atmosphere. You can   t find somebody that  you really trust to look after your stuff.  We don   t have the relatives around that you feel comfortable enough to  say,    Watch this for two weeks,    whereas his dad did. That   s basically  the difference. Yes, we do ask neighbors when we do go somewhere, but  the longest we go, really, is for four days, and then you   re back because  usually there   s cattle, there   s everything else.  2 4  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  No cows to milk, though.  No cows to milk. Got rid of them.  There won   t be. (Laughter)  Won   t be another cow to milk. I wouldn   t mind having some chickens  again and raising them. (Laughter) She had a bad experience with a  rooster. She got flogged, and it actually spurred her in the back of the  calf, and she   s having some real problems with that.  Not a good thing.  Now, my daughter, she has chickens and ducks and geese and guineas  for her kids.  Basically wants to give them the same upbringing that she had and we  had, just basics.  I went hunting with my dad. He liked to quail hunt. I don   t like to goose  hunt because I remember, as a kid, him dragging me off to the goose  blind and just freezing to death. The geese weren   t any good to eat  anyhow. The only time a goose is good to eat is as soon as he gets here  from the north because he   s been eating corn and milo up there, and he  comes down here and starts feeding on wheat, green wheat. I don   t know  whether you   ve ever smelled or tasted milk from a cow that   s been  eating green wheat. You can hardly stand the smell. It   s     It   s rancid.  It   s rancid. Geese come down and feed on the green wheat because  that   s what they eat is the forage. Within a week you can   t even stand to  cut one of them open, they smell so bad. The meat will be just like that.  People will argue the point. They   ll wrap them in bacon, and there   s  ways to hide it. I don   t like to goose hunt because my dad froze me to  death when I was a kid. Now, my son likes to hunt. I don   t deer hunt.  I   m more of a nature-type guy. I used to be a big fan of bird watching  and photography, and I got so busy farming that that kind of all went by  the wayside. I do like to quail hunt. She gave my bird dog away a couple  of years ago, so I don   t have that now.  Long story there. We won   t go into that. (Laughter)  That   s mostly what our recreation was or is, just doing things around  locally. We don   t take vacations.  2 5  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  Well, what about holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving as a  young     We overdo.  As a young kid, usually it was just family, the immediate family. We  didn   t have my   I mean, if you   re talking about when I was a kid. We  didn   t have my sister   s family come, and my mother   s family didn   t  come in or my father   s family didn   t come in. Every once in a while, I   d  have an uncle from Colorado that would be here for Christmas, he and  his wife and their kids but not very often. Usually they showed up at  harvest time, which was not a good time for Mother because that was  four extra people to have to take care of and feed. She always resented  that they showed up at that time. Now we try to get our family, our kids,  to come for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Then it was mostly just my  immediate family, my grandmother when she was alive, but outside of  aunts and uncles, no, it was just immediate family.  It   s because the family   s got so large that their families would get  together with their kids. Then when his parents were alive we would  certainly all congregate, so it was a big   and then many times we  overdo on holidays. Thanksgiving and Christmas are fun and get as  many here   my mother   s still alive, and so there for a while they would  come. It was whenever she could.  As growing up when my family was young and growing, my married  family was young and growing up, we   d always have Christmas and  Thanksgiving at my folks    house, or we   d have it out here and try to get  my sisters to come. One of them lives in Washington, Oregon now. They  very seldom were they ever here. My younger sister would be here every  once in a while, but they mostly had their families, and they had their  Christmases and Thanksgivings with their families.  You   re doing great.  Not down this list very far.  I forgot about that.  We   ve been doing a lot of yacking, getting ahead of your questions, I  think, some of them.  We   re not in any order, anyway. We   re good.  Sorry about that clock. I forgot about that one. You can live with that  noise, huh?  2 6  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Well, would they go out and cut a tree on the farm?  We did, myself and my wife and our family did, but no, my parents  never did. We didn   t have any on our farm to cut. We still don   t have  any on our farm to cut. If you drive around the countryside, you   ll find a  red cedar somewhere that   s along the road or in somebody   s pasture that  if you ask or don   t ask, you might be able to make available. We did  that. We had a red cedar, and we always cut one too big. We   d have a  hard time getting it through the door. We   d have to cut it off three or  four times before it even   even with these high ceilings, we   d have to  cut if off three or four times before we could get it in and get it set up.  We did that until we found out my son was allergic to cedar.  Every Christmas, he would be ill. Finally we put it together, and he was  allergic to that red cedar Christmas tree. (Laughter)  So from that time on we started buying our Christmas trees, but  originally     Either get a spruce or   then we eventually went fake but always green,  never silver.  As a kid, no, we always bought a Christmas tree. We wouldn   t go out  and cut one. I think my mother   s always went out and cut a tree. Maybe  that   s the only way you could get one back then. I don   t know. We  always had a Christmas tree right there in front of that window. Even as  a kid that   s where we had Christmases, in front of the window here in  this living room.  And that was mainly to show when people drove up. You always had to  have it where it could be seen.  We got a lot of visitors out here. (Laughter)  What would be the meal?  Thanksgiving: always turkey, always turkey.  Turkey and ham.  It still is. Christmastime: turkey and ham, sweet potatoes. My mother  would always make pecan pie, (she was a really good pie maker) pecan  pie and coconut cream, her two favorite types of pie. My mother   s  mother was an excellent cook, and she might have three or four different  types of pie. She   d ask my dad,    What   s your favorite kind?    He said,  2 7  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh     What you got?    She   d name them, all three, and he says,    That   s it,     and she   d bring him three pieces. (Laughter)  We   re very traditional as far as the mealtime at Thanksgiving and  Christmas goes.  In fact we were just talking about that on the way home,    What are we  going to have for Thanksgiving this year? Are we going to have turkey  again?    I said,    We can always have steak.    That   s my favorite meal,  steak and potatoes, chicken-fried steak and potatoes and gravy, white  gravy, chicken. You can   t beat it.  And his cholesterol   s low.  Yeah.  He works it off.  Probably about five thousand calories a day.  She   s tried for twenty-five years to put weight on me, and it doesn   t  happen, doesn   t happen.  Well, let   s back up a little bit. Did we talk about the buildings and things  on the Thornburgh place?  There are none left there. The house, when we moved, my dad sold the  house, and the house is still well and alive, I guess. It   s in Jet, and we  bought it and moved it to Jet. It was known as the house that had the  center of the roof cut out and upstairs built in, and that   s just what it  looked like. It looked like a normal two-roofed house and somebody  went in and chopped the middle out of the roof and just set another little  room down inside of that and put a roof over it. It was not a very well  built house. As a kid, I can remember (and I was only six when we left  over there) when the north winds would blow, the linoleum would  actually ripple with the breeze.  Like I said, we had a cistern for water. We had what we called, same  thing we call here, a washhouse, a building. I can remember Mother  burning wood to wash clothes in a copper boiler pan, oblong. We didn   t  have indoor plumbing. We had a barn and a granary. When we left over  there   anytime you abandon something, it doesn   t take very long for it  to go downhill, so it wasn   t long before we had to tear down the granary.  The big granary that we had that we stored grain in was an Army  barracks that used to be at the Kegelman Air Force Base that my dad  actually helped build that air base.  2 8  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  It was just held together with cables. After the war, I guess they didn   t  need that stuff anymore, so they   d let people have it or buy it. I don   t  know exactly how Dad came about it. It was taken down in sections, and  then when you put it back up you just cabled it back together. That   s  what he had the hogs hanging in, the cured hogs, during the wintertime  when we didn   t have any grain in it. None of that stuff is still there. The  only thing left over there is the windmill.  How would you do bath time then at that place since there   s no indoor     With your wet washcloth. Sometimes you got warm water, and  sometimes you didn   t. I remember even here when we moved over here,  the only stove in the house was downstairs, and the bedrooms were all  upstairs. When we   d get up every morning, it was always a race to see  the first one downstairs to get the prime spot in front of the stove to get  warm because we didn   t have any heat upstairs. It wasn   t until I was in  college that they actually got central air and heat. Other than that it was  just a propane gas stove. Only had one in the living room and one here  where this clock sits, and that   s the only two stoves they had in the  house. My grandmother had, I remember, she had coal. They burned  coal in a big pot-bellied stove. I can remember that.  My Granddad  Metcalf  died of Bright   s disease  when I was four years  old . I have a picture of him here just before he died, but he was not in  good health. He chewed. The big living room in there was actually two  rooms, and one of them was called the parlor. That   s where he spent his  time with a board, playing Solitaire. My mother said her biggest, (she  was the youngest) her biggest complaint was she   s the one that had to  clean the spittoon. It sat there beside the chair. Sometimes he   d hit it,  and sometimes he wouldn   t, so she   d have to clean up the mess. That  was her chore every night was to clean up that mess. Baths, when we  first moved over here, we had running water when we moved over here  and an old claw-foot bathtub. That   s what we bathed in. We didn   t have  a shower.  The first time I came here was in  19 65, and at that point they didn   t  have central air in yet because I remember that swamp cooler in the  window back here, going to the south side of the house. It was sometime  between  19 65, probably, and  19 70 that they put the central air in.  It was when I was     You know, it wasn   t that long ago, and just the progression of it    You  saying that they didn   t have running water over there, I don   t know if I  knew that (I   m listening intently) because I wouldn   t worry about it  2 9  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  because his mother was such   your mother was very much like mine in  that you could be poor as a pauper and feel rich. Being clean, I guarantee  you those kids were clean. She would   ve just seen to it. I don   t know  how y   all did it, but I bet they were because she was very particular. She  was an immaculate housekeeper.  Like I said, over there we had a cistern, and we   d collect water that ran  off the house. It went through some charcoal and then down into a well.  We had the old crank cistern that had the little buckets on it, and brought  water up and dumped them out. We moved over here, we had this well  out here. Every once in a while, Mom would say,    Dad, you need to  clean the well,    because they   d have a smell or a taste to the water. So  he   d go out there and pop the top off and look down in there. It   s about  twenty-five foot down to the water, and sure enough, there   d be a snake  or a dead frog or something down in there. He   d rope himself down, or  me, go down in there with a bucket, and we   d take that stuff out. Then  we   d drop chlorine in it, put a bit of chlorine in it, and life back as usual  then after that until it happened again.  How different is that than today because we   re on rural water system  now and were shortly after we moved here in    72,    73. Even today, our  neighbor will go in and break a line, and what do they do? The dirt and  everything comes through, and they throw chlorine in it. Then it   s  considered clean. (Laughs) Not much different. No wonder our immune  systems were wonderful, you know, because we were exposed to  everything.  I think that we had a lot less sickness then among the kids, and it   s  because we were exposed to everything. We ate dirt and made mud pies  and all that kind of things that they wouldn   t even think about doing  now. We didn   t have all these genetically altered foods, and so your  system built up antibodies. If you lived on the farm, you were exposed to  a lot of stuff, cow dragging their tail through your face when you were  milking or whatever. (Laughter)  That darned old cow.  Yeah    (Laughter)  He just keeps bringing it up, doesn   t he?     I hated those cows. I really did, especially on a hot summer day when  there was no wind. You always had to go get them. They didn   t come  up. You always had to go bring them in. Yeah, I hated that milking. I  really did. (Laughs) That was the worst chore I had.  3 0  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Well, did your mother have home remedies, like if you did get sick or  hurt?  Now, I have to admit, as a kid I had what they described as   the only  thing my folks ever called it was    red belly.    That   s what the doctor  called it, and it hospitalized me. I was three or four years old. My dad  said,    There   s nothing wrong with that kid. We   re taking him home.     The doctor said,    You   ll be back in two days,    and sure enough was  back in two days. I had the croup a lot as a kid, and so I   d have to wear,  even when I went to school, I   d have a dishcloth or a diaper wrapped  around my neck soaked with BenGay. I   d have BenGay on my neck, or  I   d have Vicks vapor rub under my nose.  That stuff smelled so good.  Yeah. In the wintertime, I   d have a sore throat all the time. As far as  home remedies, yeah, we   d have the custard pad. If you got stung by a  bee or something, Mother would put the soda pad, or wet soda and put it  over it to draw it out or on a boil. What was it she did? We   d have a boil  every once in a while, and she would heat water up in a bottle and then  pour the water out and stick it over your skin     To draw it out.     to draw it out because that   d form a vacuum when that cooled, and it  would draw the core of the boil out.  I think it works to this day.  That would hurt, pretty much, too.  Yeah, yeah. (Laughter) Outside of that, we had chickenpox, we had  measles     Stomachache, what would you do for a stomachache? Not castor oil, I  hope.  Oh, yeah, we took castor oil.  We took cod liver oil     Yeah, that, too.     just for the health of it.  To this day she tries to sneak a fish oil tablet in for my   and no, doesn   t  3 1  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  work, doesn   t work. As far as home remedies, not anything for anything  serious or anything like that. Like I said, as far as I know, the only really  serious illness I had as a kid was that red belly, and that   s the only  definition that was ever given for it. My older sister thinks that   s the  reason I   ve never been able to gain weight is because of whatever that  did to me at that time because I was really young.  You have uncles that are built just like you. It   s genetics.  I have a real high metabolic rate. I can   t sit still. I get this all the time,  whether it be in church, or whether it be in a movie, or whether it be at a  doctor   s office. My hands or my feet are moving. I   m usually a fairly  quiet type guy. For hobbies, I like to fish and hunt. I could go to the  woods and be by myself and just be happy.  Well, what did you do after high school?  Okay, I went to Northwestern in Alva, got a degree in education. Went  to Stephen F. Austin  State  University at Nacogdoches, Texas, and got  a master   s degree in biology. That   s where I met her. I was a student lab  instructor, and she was one of my students. I couldn   t wait for her to get  out of my class so I could date her.  I got an A. (laughter)  She was pretty smart. The reason I went down there is because I had a  biology professor at Northwestern that I thought a lot of and he was  going to take a teaching job down there, so I made an application for the  master   s program and got accepted. He got a teaching job offered to him  at East Central at Ada. That   s where he   s from, and so he took that job,  and I went on to Texas. Then when I graduated from there with a  master   s degree, I applied for doctorate degree program at Arizona State  University, and she was in the nursing program. She was a sophomore     Finished sophomore year in Texas.     in her sophomore year in Texas when we got married and went out to  Arizona State. I was in school there for a year and a half. We still had  the draft, and the Vietnam War was going on. At that time you could get  school exemptions if you were in college, and so I kept making  applications for the exemption. I kept getting them, and she got into the  nursing program out at Arizona State into a new program which was a  progress at your own rate. You didn   t have semesters. You completed  the coursework, and they advanced you to the next level.  I got a draft notice and went through the appeal process. I was twenty-  3 2  seven days from being twenty-six years old when they denied my  appeal, and I got drafted. They won   t take you when you   re twenty-six.  Once you were twenty-six you could not be drafted, so they got me, like,  fourteen days before. There were four of us in the graduate school out  there that got our notices all at the same time. The physical at that time  when you went to do your physical (not to be selective service draft, like  when you turned eighteen you had to go take a physical) when you get  your notice that you   re going to go in, you take another physical.  At that time they were wanting people so bad that I said I   d broken my  collarbone when I was in graduate school and still had a big knot on it. I  thought,    I won   t be an infantryman because I can   t carry a rifle because  I can   t carry anything on that shoulder.    Well, to pass the physical,  actually, if you didn   t run into a doorway and you were warm to the  touch, you passed. Soldiers were dying. That was in    69. They were  dying pretty fast in Vietnam.  There were three of us that we decided that we   re going to join the  Navy. We all had degrees, and that supposedly allowed you to pick the  area that you would like to be in. There was a water research that the  Navy had going on at the time, and so we decided we were going to join  the Navy, all three of us. Navy recruiter was closed the day we went, and  we had procrastinated long enough that we didn   t have but just a day or  two to either sign up or be drafted. If you drafted, it was two years. If  you signed up, it was four. Well, we didn   t want to just be a soldier,  carrying the gun, so we all joined the Air Force. They allowed us to  finish that semester of school. They put us in the Reserves until we  finished that semester of school so we wouldn   t lose out on that  semester.  We all joined the Air Force. I went in the Air Force in    69. I wanted to  be a teacher and do research. I was actually really interested in birds. For  my doctorate degree, I was going to work on the life history of the  Lucy   s Warbler, which is only found in Arizona and southern New  Mexico in the United States. I was out there two years, and I had yet to  find one. (Laughs) By the time I got drafted, which was in January, I had  finished all my coursework, and I had taken my exams. All I lacked was  doing my research and dissertation. That was the same with the other  two that joined at the same time.  I went to San Antonio for initial training and all that. Down there, they  also gave you a choice.    What would you like to do?    I didn   t know at  the time whether it was actually going to be valid or not because they  put you where they needed you, basically. I took a test, physiology test,  and I passed it. I sat at Lackland Air Force Base for six weeks because  they didn   t know what to do with me because I was the only one who   d  3 3  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  ever taken the test and passed it. I couldn   t go off base. I couldn   t do  anything. I just sat there and did nothing all day long. They had no task  for me. Finally they gave me orders and sent me to Maine to     Bangor.  Bangor, Maine. She had quit school. No, she was actually still in school  until that time. We loaded everything we had up in a four-by-eight trailer  that I   d built that we   d moved from Texas to Arizona in. We loaded that  up, and we headed for Bangor, Maine. I was supposed to be what they  called the Physiological Training Specialist, which was altitude chamber  work and training pilots on the effects of altitude. We got up there, went  into the hospital, and told them what I was. The Colonel looked at me  and he says,    Physiological Training Specialist, what the H is that?    I  said,    It   s altitude chamber work, training pilots.    He said,    The closest  altitude chamber to us is nine hundred miles to the south. I wanted a  physical therapist. That   s what my slot   s for, physical therapist.    I said,     Well, I can be a physical therapist. I haven   t had any training in this  other. I can do on-the-job training.     But I made the mistake of saying,    You know, it   s funny because three  of the guys I went through basic training with were registered physical  therapists, and none of them ended up as that in the Air Force.    Two of  them ended up as orderlies, what we called bed pan commandos, just  being orderlies. He got on the phone, and he called Lackland Air Force  Base. I was sitting there, and he says,    You come back tomorrow.    I  went back the next day, and he said,    Where do you want to go?    I said,     I want to go to Phoenix, Arizona. That way I can finish my degree and  my wife can finish her degree.    He said,    Done deal because you   re not  staying here. I   m getting a physical therapist.     So we packed our trailer back up. We hadn   t unloaded it much, but we   d  packed up what we   d taken out of it. Went back in the next day and got  my orders, and he says,    I can   t get you to Phoenix. SAC  Strategic Air  Command  will not release you.    The base at Bangor was a B-52  bomber base, and he says,    SAC won   t release you to Air Training  Command. You have to stay in SAC.    They sent me to Tucson. He said,     That   s the closest I can get you,    so I ended up in Tucson in the U2 spy  program, integrating pilots into U2 planes, their high-pressure flight  suits, and did that for four years.  Ended up in Vietnam, anyhow, but not with a gun over my shoulder. I  wasn   t there that long. I was supposed to be over there for three months.  The most they   d ever send our group was ninety days, eighty-nine days,  actually, because if you went ninety-one days then you were classified  as in combat zone and they had to pay you special pay, and so they  3 4  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  rotated you out every eighty-nine days. I had been over there twice  before, just ferrying things over and bringing back whatever  maintenance was doing. They had to bring them back to the States. That  was the only U2 base we had was at Davis-Monthan  Air Force Base  in  Tucson.  It got too dangerous for the U2 planes. The day I landed at the Da Nang  Air Base there were three helicopters and two fighter planes on fire next  to the runway. They decided it was too dangerous for the U2s because  there weren   t that many of them, and so they moved us to Thailand. So I  spent my eighty-nine days in Thailand instead of in Vietnam which I   m  thankful for, but the service disrupted our plans. We moved to Tucson.  University of Arizona would not accept Arizona State University   s  nursing program credits. She didn   t want to start over again, and I  couldn   t get her to move to Phoenix and live with friends while I was  gone for the two years or year and a half it would   ve taken her to finish.  I would today. (Laughter)  She   d do it today. She didn   t finish her degree, and I didn   t finish my  degree.  Then I wouldn   t.   During  my four years in the service, I did some time in Florida and  Thailand. That   s the only two times I wasn   t in  Tucson . Our son was  born in Arizona. I got out of service, and I sent out a hundred  applications for teaching jobs in small colleges throughout the western  United States. Got one reply back out of a hundred. We literally sent out  a hundred. I got one reply back, and it was negative. The others didn   t  even respond. The reason for not hiring was because of the war program  and the funds were not available. Most of the colleges were using  science foundation monies to support their science programs. They   d cut  that money all back because of the war effort, and so there weren   t any  slots available. My dad was not in good health, and he said he needed  help on the farm. I needed a job, and so we moved back with the  intention of helping for a couple of years and still looking for a job. We  were here and lived in my grandmother   s house in Jet     For a year.     for a year. I came out one day to go to work, and Dad said,    Oh, by  the way, we   re moving to Enid. You can move out on the farm.    I said,     Okay, but I really wasn   t planning on staying here.    He says,    You got  a choice to make. Either you   re going to farm, because I   m leaving and  moving and the house is yours       I still didn   t have a prospect for a job  3 5  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  in the teaching field. I   d done my practice teaching at Enid High School  when I   d gotten my bachelor   s degree, and I decided high school was  not where I wanted to be. I wanted to be somewhere where kids wanted  to be, not where they had to be, so in    73 we moved to the farm, and  we   ve been here ever since. That   s how we     And it   s been a good life.  It   s been a good life, but she didn   t finish her degree, which we both  regret because     It didn   t make any difference.     that   s one of the promises I made to her Dad, that she would finish her  degree. Circumstances didn   t allow that, and choices didn   t allow that,  so she didn   t finish it, which I regret and I know she does.  Well     Once she had a family, family is what she wanted to have, anyhow. I  don   t think she would have worked when the kids were young. She did  go to work because basically she had to in order for us to survive the  farm.  Worked outside the home for eighteen years. Just retired three years ago.  From what, from doing what?  I became the election board secretary of our county.  Which is ironic because she hated history and anything to do with  government. (Laughter)  It was the worst subject in all world for me, was anything civics or  politics or anything. I never thought I   d go into that. Loved the job. The  job was extremely interesting.  And it was needed in order to keep the farm?  Yes.  Well, while you were in the service, what was happening on the farm?  Well     It was a golden age, actually, of farming.  3 6  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  My dad probably made more money in the   60s but did more  complaining because the government keep getting more involved in the  programs. I remember him writing back and stating that you can only  farm so many acres or you could only raise so many bushels, and  anything over that you couldn   t sell. It had to be stored, therefore a lot of  black market wheat was going on, and the government got more  involved in what you were allowed to do and how much you could plant  and how much you could harvest. That hasn   t changed. That hasn   t done  anything but gotten worse.   Pat   s dad  often said had he not retired that he would probably be in jail  because of the programs that came out when we were young farmers.  They started telling you how to do it, and so many of the programs even  now are useless. Why did they do it? Why do they subsidize? It kept us  afloat, don   t get me wrong, a few years, but basically those programs  were wrong. Still are.  They mandated that you do certain things. Soil and water conservation,  they came out with guidelines, highly erodible land. Most of the farmers  in this area that I   m aware of, it just bothered the heck out of them if  their land washed or if it blew. They were already doing things to  prevent that because they didn   t want it to happen. When they came out  with the regulations that you couldn   t break out any wetlands, and if you  had pastureland you had to get permission to break it out, and it couldn   t  be used for base acres...  I know one year I grazed this place off just east of me here, and it   s  highly erodible due to wind because this is a sandy area, sandy loam.  When I grazed it off   you had to have so much tilth, so much organic  matter on the surface of the soil, and I didn   t have because I   d grazed it  off. I got a certified letter from the Soil Conservation Service stating that  I had to plant rows of silage or hay grazer every hundred feet, and I had  to run them east and west. I went over there, and I talked to the director.  I said,    You   re considering this highly erodible. Do you realize that that  land slopes east to west? If I get a rain, the water   s going to run because  you   re going to make me farm it east to west instead of at an angle,     which is the way I always farmed it so the water didn   t run straight up  and down the hill. He said,    Regulations are regulations.    I planted my  strips, and I tilled in between them. We got three- and four-inch rains,  and I brought him out here and said,    This is your program. Now, which  was worse: me trying to keep it from blowing, or the erosion?    He said,     The guidelines are the guidelines.     I got pretty burned on government involvement, and it hasn   t done  anything but gotten worse since then. The new farm program, I have not  3 7  found anyone yet that can even begin to explain it to me. You can   t go  over to the FSA  Farm Service Agency  office and ask them about it  because they haven   t seen the regulations. They don   t have them written  yet. The deal of it is, it took them two years to get it. They can   t explain  it. Once you make the decision on how you want to go, you   re stuck  with it for five years. You cannot change it. It   s locked in, and you got  two ways you can go. One of them is called ARC  Agricultural Risk  Coverage , and the other one   s called PLC  Price Loss Coverage , I  think.  They had to extend the last farm program. I was against the subsidies  that we got because you got them regardless. Whether you had a good  crop or a bad crop, you just got so much money every year. Don   t get  me wrong. I paid my taxes, I took the money, but it wasn   t helping the  farmer. It kept us afloat, and we had some really hard times because I  wasn   t carrying any insurance. My dad never did carry insurance. I  didn   t carry insurance. In    89 we had the hailstorm that wiped out seven  quarters. The ground was as slick as this table. The next year we had a  drought, and out of eleven quarters of land, I cut fifteen thousand  bushels of wheat. I was getting about a  44,000 subsidy from the  government. They told me I had to start taking insurance or I wasn   t  going to qualify for any programs because I   d had those two disasters.  Either it   s catastrophic or the catastrophic program was just barely  enough to even get your seed back.  I talked to the banker, and he said, well   I felt bad because I wasn   t  making any money. Farming wasn   t making any money. We looked at  five years    worth of history, and the only money that I cleared in that  five years was the farm subsidy money. My dad through his farming  operation had managed to go from one quarter that my mother had, the  quarter that he had forty acres of and bought the rest of it from his  family, to seven more quarters of land he bought and paid for. He asked  me one day, he said,    How come you can   t improve yourself? I did  this.    He had a goal. He wanted to do what my mother   s dad had done:  left a legacy in land for his family.  I said,    Well, let   s look at this way, Dad. When I started farming with  you, we ran propane tractors. Propane was two cents a gallon. You paid  it once a year. You didn   t have to pay it every month. You went in once  a year and paid it. The newest tractor you bought, which was in  1965   .    He bought a G1000 tractor. Cost him  6,500. I said,    You got   3.75 for your wheat that year. It   s now 1980. I   m the only one in the  country that doesn   t have a cab tractor. I   m still using that 707, that  G1000 that you had. I   m still getting  3.25 for my wheat. Propane is  now ninety cents a gallon, fertilizer is five times what you paid for it,  diesel fuel has gone up, and land prices have gone up.     3 8  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  I bought my first new tractor in, well my only new tractor, in 1980. It  was a Case tractor 2390 with a cab. I bought it and a Schafer disk. My  brother-in-law had bought a tractor the year before, a John Deere 4640, I  believe it was. He paid  12,000 for it. The dealership offered him   15,000 to buy it back before he ever took it off the lot because there  was the demand. I bought my tractor the next year. It cost me  30,000.  A John Deere tractor the same size that my brother-in-law had bought  the year before was now  40,000.  The price of wheat had gone to seven dollars. Price of machinery went  up, the price of wheat came down, price of machinery still went up until,  when was it, 2000, what, wheat got up to seven dollars again. Most of  that time in the   70s,   80s, and   90s, wheat never got above four dollars,  but the input cost kept going up. Right now, a pound of nitrogen  fertilizer costs fifty-four cents a pound. When my dad put it on, it cost  seven cents a pound.  We   re still raising thirty bushel of wheat, same wheat. We cannot  increase the bushels per acre because of weather. The limiting conditions  is heat and water. It doesn   t make any difference how much fertilizer  you pour to it or how good an operator you are. If you don   t have the  water and you have too hot of temperatures, you   re not going to raise a  crop. Regardless of what the other costs are, those are the two things that  make farming successful: water and temperature. Wheat got up to nine  dollars, ten dollars, even. That same  30,000 tractor now costs a   110,000.  It   s all imperative.  This combine right here in this picture, my dad bought new in 1961. He  bought it off a railcar in Kiowa, Kansas. It was in parts. He and my  uncle went up there to put it together. They spent two days just laying  the parts out. Humphrey Implement Company, the owner of the  company come out and said,    Vern, if you   ll pay me       He paid  820  for the combine.    Vern for another  200, we   ll put it together for you.     Dad had already been up there two days, and they just had the parts laid  out. Two days later, he drove it home from Kiowa, Kansas, roaded it  home from Kiowa, Kansas, put together. This article was in the Enid  paper. My dad was eighty-two years old, and those combines were still  cutting wheat. That was the last year that they ran, not because they  didn   t run anymore. It   s because they were too slow.  They didn   t have a cab.  They had fourteen-foot headers. He mentions in this deal that he cut  3 9  wheat from    61 to 2001 with those combines. We cut all of our own  wheat, anywhere from 750 to 1,500 acres with those two machines, and  it would take all of June into July. I watched a lot of Fourth of Julys  sitting on a combine. At night you   d see the fireworks going off. By the  way, that tractor I bought in 1980, brand new, was the last piece of new  equipment I   ve ever owned until two years ago. I bought a drill which  was brand new. My combine today, without a header, cost almost   280,000. You add the header to it, you got another  70,000 minimum,  so you got a  350,000 combine that you use two weeks out of the year.  You buy a tractor now   I   ve got two four-wheel-drive tractors. I farm  almost two thousand acres, sixteen hundred acres of crop land. They   re  both used. One of them brand new cost  150,000, and it   s one of the  cheaper made tractors out there. It   s a Buhler Versatile. It   s a good  tractor, don   t get me wrong. It   s an excellent tractor, easy to work on,  but it   s not a John Deere or a Case. It doesn   t have that brand name. You  don   t pay that extra money for the green paint, as they say, because the  green does cost more, and they break down just as much, but they have a  good marketing program, and green does cost more.  There   s no way that I can make my mind wrap around the fact that I can  go out and spend that kind of money for a piece of equipment and ever  expect to pay it back, ever expect for that piece of machinery to pay for  itself. That one combine that Dad bought was the only new combine he  ever owned. I   ve never owned a new combine. I   ve got one that   s a 1972  twenty-five-foot International combine, one of the first rotary combines  that came out. I bought it for  14,500, used. Bought it from a custom  cutter that used it to cut on me, and since then I   ve added another used  combine. It   s the 1989 International combine that I paid  22,000 for, and  those are going to last me as long as I farm.  By necessity, a new tractor   you can have a million dollars tied up in  equipment to just have the minimum amount of equipment you need to  farm. I had a neighbor just bought a fifty-foot cultivator. Cost him  almost  60,000. He   s seventy years old. He   ll never pay for it with the  crop because the price of wheat right now is  5.51 in Jet. Dr.  Michael   Anderson, OSU Agronomist, predicts that for the next five years wheat   s  going to be below six dollars.  I   m seventy-one years old. I can   t find help. One of these questions  asked about help. When I was a kid, my dad always had help, but it was  usually an uncle that lived in town and loved working on the farm.  When my dad moved to Enid, he came out and helped farm for several  years, always came out at harvest time until 2000, probably, 2001 or   2.  Well, this last year, 2001, he was eighty-one years old. The year before,  he always ran a combine. Well, he ran the combine into the truck twice,  4 0  so the next year I put him in the truck because he was going to be here  regardless. When he came out from Enid, he stayed here. He brought a  little camper out, and he stayed here for however long it took to harvest.  Well, the next year, I put him in a truck. When he came back, I was  servicing   I serviced everything every morning. The truck bumper was  bent back into the fender on one side. I had two truck drivers. I said,     All right, who wants to confess to dinging my truck?    Silence. Finally  Dad said,    That   d be me.       What   d you hit?       I hit the elevator.     (Laughter) I went up and talked to the elevator personnel. He not only  hit it once, he hit it three times, so it became too dangerous and too  expensive for him to be a part of the harvest crew. The next year I made  sure I had enough numbers, not quality but numbers, to help harvest. I  told him, and he said,    What   re you going to have me doing this year?    I  said,    How about observing?    (Laughter) He didn   t much like that, but  he understood, I think. He was bitter about it, but help is a limiting  factor.  Two years ago I did all the farming myself. I could not find anybody to  run the tractor, so all the ground work, all the wheat planting, up until  harvest time I did myself. Like to worn myself out. Last year, I struggled  to find somebody to even drive   not this past harvest but the harvest  before, I struggled to find somebody to even drive a truck, and I finally  did find a kid. If I   d have given him another three days, he   d have torn  every piece of equipment up I had. I would not allow him on a tractor.  He wanted to work, but he couldn   t take instruction and he didn   t care.  That   s the problem. Most of the people want a job and a paycheck, but  they don   t want to do any work. If you don   t have a cab, they don   t want  to work. They don   t care whether they show up on time. Now that the oil  boom has hit, you can   t compete with the prices.  The only help you can find are those that don   t pass the drug test  because the oil companies won   t take them if they can   t pass a drug test.  The only thing they can do is manual labor, run a tractor for a farmer. I  had a kid that I hired that I didn   t know was on methamphetamine, but  he was. As soon as I found that out   well, I found out because he was  doing weird field work. Instead of going around and around, he was  making designs. (Laughter) I asked him why, and he said,    I felt like it.     I said,    We don   t do that.    He was high on methamphetamines. My son  is in corrections. I said something to him about it. He said,    Does he eat  a lot of candy bars?    One day he had his shirt open, and he had all kinds  of sores on his chest. I thought he was allergic to something and was  scratching it.  I   d had a break-in in my shed, and a highway patrolman had to come  there that morning. This kid was there, and as soon as the highway  4 1  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  patrolman drove in, the kid got on the tractor and left. The highway  patrolman knew him. He had a drug dog, and he says,    I guarantee you  if I let that drug dog out he   ll hit on his car, but that   s not what I   m out  here for.    That   s what was wrong with the kid, and he died from it, not  while he was in my employ but a couple of years later. You just can   t  find help.  For the first time, this year I hired a lady to drive the tractor. I   m on the  co-op board, and I   d been told by a couple of co-op directors that,    Hire  a woman. If you can find a woman, hire a woman because she   ll be  more careful and she   ll show up on time.    Well, that   s not the way I was  raised, but I had the opportunity this year to hire a lady. She   d been on a  tractor before, she knew what to do, she showed up every day, and she  was good help. I had to pay thirteen dollars an hour, and five-dollar  wheat and all the other inputs, that doesn   t work very well. Being the  type of person I am, all I   d let her do was drive the tractor. I wouldn   t  have her fix fence or feed the cattle or do what I consider manly manual  labor type things. She helps her husband do those things, but I just  couldn   t force myself to even ask her to do those things. I think she  would   ve if I   d have asked her, but I just couldn   t do that. That   s not the  way I was brought up, not the way I   m made. I still open the door for  women and say,    Yes ma   am,    and that sort of thing.  I would drive trucks, but I just never drove a tractor as a farm wife.  Quite a few, several of them out here do, but it   s just one of those things.  I   ll mow the grass, I   ll do all those things, and drive the trucks but not  drive a tractor.  She wasn   t a very good truck driver in the hay fields. She   d throw you  off the trucks pretty easily.  I couldn   t see the holes. (Laughter)  My mother never drove. I can only remember her driving the tractor one  time, and that was only after Dad had gotten hydraulics. Even I was too  small to lift the levers on the old implements that didn   t have hydraulics  on them because I never was very big. She got balled up one day with  straw, and she got off the tractor and walked a half mile back to the  house and said,    I   m done. That   s it.    She never helped again. She   d  drive a truck every once in a while, but she   d never get on a tractor  again, and I never asked her to. That wasn   t her role. She was the wife  and housekeeper and took care of the children. She   ll make the comment  I was never around. Well, it wasn   t because I was playing poker or  fishing or hunting. It was because I was in the field. As a kid, the  tractors were ready to roll when the sun came up.  4 2  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  You do hear so much of young people, occasionally say their husband   s  not home. I will just reply to them,    Look, in the farming community  they   re not home from before sunup until midnight many a time because  of continual tractor work.    I don   t empathize well or sympathize with  them very much.  I   m glad my children were raised on the farm.  I am, too.  I don   t think they could have a better, in this community or probably any  small, rural community, I don   t think they could   ve had a better   they  could maybe have had a better education somewhere else, but I doubt it.  They   ve done well. One has a bachelor   s degree, and the other has a  doctorate degree, so they pursued. Our son will probably live here after  us. He wants to move back and loves the rural area, but will he farm?  He   d probably lease it out. He doesn   t like to be alone. He   s not the  temperament to be alone in the tractor that much, I think, not that type of  person.  I   m seventy-one, and I   ve reached the age that with not being able to  find help, good help, I   ve almost made my decision up to not farm  anything except what the family owns. I don   t really know how long I   m  going to do that, but I   ll be giving up five quarters of land. Probably this  year will be my last year to farm those. I   ve got three grandkids now,  and I want to be able to spend time with them. I want to be able to form  a hobby. I like to read, but my wife thinks that   s a waste of time, so I  need to find a different hobby. (Laughter) I want to have time for those,  and I   m tired.  I haven   t talked to anybody yet that can figure out the government  regulations, and they   re just getting so desperately bad that   they call  the farm program    the farm program,    but it   s only, like, 15 percent of it  actually goes to farmers. The rest of it   s all school lunch programs and  food stamps. The biggest part of it   s food stamps now. The most money  goes out to food stamps. It   s still part of the farm program, so when  people see Congress has passed a five-trillion-dollar or billion-dollar, or  whatever it is, farm bill, they think,    Oh, those farmers, look how lucky  they are.     I   ve always contended that it should be on a needs basis. Of course, a lot  of farms now are corporate farms. They are not owned by individual  farmers. They   re owned by corporations and farmed by farm people, but  they don   t actually own the land. I don   t think they should be eligible for  subsidies because they   re just using those as tax breaks. That   s mostly  4 3  what a corporate farm is for, to be a tax break for some big, large  corporation. They farm to lose money, but they qualify for government  programs because they   re farmers.  Just this past year, this livestock disaster drought program, I wasn   t even  going to sign up for it, mostly because first I thought, man, the  paperwork involved, you   re going to have to show how many cows you  had to sell because of the drought or how many extra bales of hay you  had to feed. My neighbor went over   all I   ve got is twenty-six cows.  My neighbor, he has twenty-six cows. He said,    You better go sign up  for the drought program.    I said,    Why?    And he told me what they paid  him. I said,    What did you have to give for paperwork?    He says,     Nothing. I didn   t have to prove a thing. All I had to do was show them  how many cows I had.     I used to buy my own stocker cattle and run them on wheat pasture.  That   s a big part of the   that   s the only thing that kept us alive, actually,  was the cattle end of it. Farming did not pay for itself. If you didn   t run  cattle on your wheat pasture, you just couldn   t have made it. It reduced  your yields for your wheat crop, but the cattle money was better than the  wheat money. Together, you could make it work. Well, when I got  towards the point where I   d need four or five hundred head of cattle to  put on the wheat pasture, I just couldn   t do that, couldn   t find the help,  and I wasn   t a good manager of sick cattle. I didn   t like to have to  borrow that much money and always the threat of not being able to pay  it back if you had a disaster.  I started taking in cattle on the gain, and I developed, luckily, a rapport  with a guy in Nebraska that sends me cattle. We   ve had a good  relationship now for about twelve years. I   d take anywhere, depending  on what the weather dictates, anywhere from three hundred to six  hundred head. For three or four years there, I was making more money  on his cattle than he was making on them because I was getting good  gains. Now a baby calf less than a week old costs  750- 800 for a baby  calf.  This guy buys somewhere close to six thousand head of cattle a year,  and they   re going to cost him almost  1,500 a head just for a 450-500  pound calf. The strain on my mental abilities to put out that kind of  money and to lose one, I just couldn   t take it. That was one of the  reasons I quit buying my own because stress gets to me very quickly.  Used to be, I could drop fifteen pounds in a week just because of  anxiety. One day I decided,    I can   t control the weather. I can   t control  the price of cattle. I can control the death loss, and I   m not very good at  that, but there are so many things that I can   t control.    I gave that up to  God, and I quit losing weight.  4 4  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Found peace.  Right. Quit worrying about things I couldn   t control, and it   s been a  good program. This livestock disaster program, that was the biggest  money giveaway that I know of in the farm program that the government  has ever done. In my particular case, I couldn   t run six hundred head. I  could only run three hundred. If there were going to be a disaster, it  should   ve been on the number of cattle I couldn   t run because of the  drought, not on what I could. It was on how many I couldn   t run.  First they came out and said if you didn   t own the cattle, you couldn   t  collect on them. Makes sense, so I turned my stuff in. They told me,     Turn it in as fast as you can. We want to get you paid as fast as we can  because they   re going to sequester the money, and so we want to get you  paid as fast as we can.       What about these cattle that I take in on the  gain?       Oh, you have to own them.    A month later, they changed their  mind.    You don   t have to own them. You just have to have a contract  stating that you took them in on the gain, but that contract has to be  specific.       What are the specifics of it?       We don   t know yet.     In 2011,   12, and   13, my contract is a handshake. Okay, I think  everything that   s required, if they ever tell me what the written contract  has to have in it, I think is included in my handshake. Death loss, you   re  responsible for a certain amount of death after, like, 2 percent. He   s  responsible for 2 percent death loss, date when they come in, rate of  gain. I   m responsible for water, feed, and fences, all that kind of stuff  while they   re here. If I can   t account for a calf, I have to buy it. You  follow me? If take in 400 and I can only send 399 back and none of  them died, I   ve lost a calf somewhere. I have to pay for that calf. That   s  all included in my handshake. That   s a verbal agreement with him.  Well, you can go back and write those contracts now, but they can   t tell  me what has to be in them yet. First, they to told me it   d be two weeks  and they   d have a copy of the type of contract you needed because it   s  going to be up to the local office, local FSA office, to decide whether  they   ll accept it or not accept it. It   s a month later, I still don   t have a  copy of the contract, and now I   m not even sure they   re going to allow  it. Part of the problem is     So much of farming now is not just the labor of. It is the keeping up with  the programs.  Part of the original part of that problem is when they said that you had to  own them, the people that owned them took credit for them, and now I  can   t. That   s just not right.  4 5  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Mismanaged program.  When they can   t even tell you what the programs are and what the  regulations are, you can   t even sign up for them yet. We   ve got a farm  bill, but they haven   t written the regulations for them yet. I got an email  the other day stating that I have until, I think, June 15 to sign up for the  new program, but I can   t sign up for it before November 15 because they  don   t have the regulations written yet and the FSA doesn   t have software  to do it. They have date specifics that you have to have certain things  done, but they can   t explain the program to you. If you go to FSA and  ask them to explain the program to you, they won   t because they   re  afraid they   ll make a mistake. I   m talking with a lady at OSU that is  supposed to be a farm program expert, and she can   t even answer stuff  yet because they don   t have the regulations all written.  How do you keep up with everything?  You don   t.  Is it mostly online? I mean, it just seems     Well, keeping up with it     Good question.  Keeping up with it and understanding it are two different things. They   ll  send out the deadline dates when you have to have certain things done.  By notice, so you get it.  I get an email, and not everybody does that. If you don   t get an email,  they   re supposed to send you a letter. Now, this is from the FSA office. I  get most of my information from my crop insurance people. I probably  get three emails a month bringing me up to date on what they   ve found  out so far. Soil conservation service, I talked about the highly erodible  land. You signed a contract for that fifteen years ago, or maybe twenty  years ago now. It   s never been updated. I   ve never received another  thing about it, except if you   re not in compliance you don   t qualify for  programs, but they never come out and check. I   ve put in for terraces to  be rebuilt, our waterways to be rebuilt. They   ve never come out and  surveyed them. For two years now, they haven   t done it because they  don   t have anybody in the office to do it. They can   t compete with the  oil boom, basically. I mean if you can make  22 an hour versus,  probably, a  22,000 salary working for FSA, what   re you going to take?  4 6  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  So the oil boom in this area has had a big impact.  It   s had a big impact on several things. You can   t find help because of it.  Even the local co-ops are losing people and you can   t find   I   ve been a  director of the co-op now for almost twenty-two years, and we used to  not have any problem finding help. You don   t get the best quality  people, but they know how to work most of the time. Then, of course,  because of the insurance, they all have to be drug tested on a random  basis now. That   s mostly for insurance purposes, but you can   t compete.  The co-ops can   t compete with the oil companies. We have better long-term  retirement benefits, but most of the people want the immediate  gratification.  They can   t think long-term. They go to work for the oil company for  eighteen, nineteen dollars an hour. Well, the oil boom   s going to be  overwith probably in less than five years. They can be on the co-op,  make fourteen dollars an hour, get all their health insurance paid for,  including their family, get a retirement benefit, get so many days of sick  leave and so many days of vacation time, and in twenty years they   ll  have a fairly nice retirement program and their medical bills mostly paid  for, but they can   t see that. They want the money in the hand, and they  want it now.  People we have on our co-op now are doing twice the work they ought  to be doing because we can   t find help. Same thing   s happened to the  farmer. If you don   t have a son here to help you, you   re just about out of  luck. Most of the families   there   s several families around here that  have become fairly large farmers, and it   s because the families have  stayed in the farming. I discouraged mine from staying in the farming  because I didn   t think he could make a living at it and I didn   t think he   d  put up with the regulations.  Pride is probably what   s kept me in it, the fact that we have two  centennial farms, and my family   s been a farming family. I have  preached to my children, to my son, who doesn   t have any children, (and  he   s going to get half of what I own)    Do not sell it. Give it to your  sister   s children.    I won   t care by that time because I   m going to be long  gone. Hopefully they   ll keep it in the family and keep at least a part of it  going because heritage has meant a lot to me and it   s meant a lot to my  family. It   s hard to give it up.  It   s a deep seeded thing in a rural community. Once you live it, it just  means a lot to you.  And where I don   t have anybody that   s actually in the family going to  farm, I   ve got a grandson that   s only two years old that likes tractors and  4 7  combines. (Laughter) I   ve got a hope and faith there that maybe one day  he   ll live out here and farm the ground, but I don   t know that to be a  fact. That   s what you strive for. That   s what you hope for, that the  legacy will just keep going, but, like I say, in another twenty years, I  probably won   t care because I   ll be gone.  It   s just I hate to see it disappear, and it is. It   s becoming more corporate.  We used to have several hog farmers around here, but they can   t  compete with the big companies. If a cow could have a calf every six  months instead of one a year, the cattle industry would be integrated,  too, and the feed lots would own all the cattle in the country from mama  cows all the way through the system, but they can   t afford to because it  takes too long. Now, chickens and hogs, those are all integrated. They   re  all owned by   Tyson Food is the biggest hog owner in the United  States. I don   t know, maybe chicken, Swift may be it, but they own  everything. They own the sows, and the people doing all the work don   t  own anything. They   re just out there. To me, there   s a pride in owning it  and wanting to make it work, even if you have to.     I couldn   t farm some land because I was still using old equipment, and  they didn   t think they looked good on their farm, for somebody to be out  there without a cab tractor. They don   t own the farm anymore. The  people that were farming it don   t farm it anymore because they couldn   t  make the payments on it. My granddad was extremely conservative. My  dad, because that   s who he learned from was my mother   s dad, was  extremely conservative. He passed that on to me. I don   t get rid of it  until it doesn   t work anymore or you can   t buy repairs for it.  Those two combines, the day that those went off this farm, you could go  out there and put a battery in them and crank them both up, and they   d  run, and they   d cut wheat because that   s the kind of shape that we kept  them in. I try to put everything I have in the shed, especially my  combines and my tractors. I keep them in a shed. That   s the reason those  combines lasted for forty years, sixty years, (I guess sixty years) because  we kept them in sheds, protected them, and maintained them. That   s just  the way I grew up.  I didn   t grow up with anything new, and I found out you could farm  without having new. It didn   t have to be bright green or white or red or  whatever color. John Deere people are John Deere people, but Case  people are Case people, too. It doesn   t really make any difference what  the brand is. If that   s what you farm with, that   s what you   re proud of. I  saw a lot of farmers my age when they first started farming that thought  they had to have everything new, instant gratification, new tractors, new  drills, new everything, and they   re not farming anymore. That   s what  happened to a lot of the   what, fifteen years ago when we had a lot of  4 8  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  bankruptcies in the farming program. That was the reason, because we  had good money. Wheat got up to seven, eight, nine dollars, and they  went out and bought equipment. When wheat dropped to even six  dollars   right now, I think the break-even price on wheat in a farming  operation if you   re buying machinery and have to pay for land is  5.85 a  bushel, at thirty-bushel wheat.  And what is the going price,  5.51, now?  Right, today, or yesterday, wheat was  5.51. You can   t even buy one  combine and make the payments on it and make it work unless you  custom cut with it. Do y   all remember when they had the big tractor  parade, and the farmers took the tractors to Washington, DC, and  paraded the tractors up and down the streets to protest the farm bill and  the farm programs? Called    The American Farmer Movement.    I didn   t  join that movement. Most the tractors that went there were new tractors.  They weren   t paid for, but that   s not what the people saw. The people  saw new tractors, and they thought,    What are they complaining about?  They   re all driving new tractors.    If I   d have gone, I   d have taken my  707 that was already twenty years old. That   s what I would have been  running up and down. It was paid for.  But yet the conservative person wasn   t going to run those tractors up and  down the road to start with.  There was actually tractors that were from Oklahoma all the way on the  road to Washington, some in this area.  It defeats the purpose. You   d wear your tractor out.  Instead of putting them on a truck and hauling them there, part of the  deal was seeing them across America.  There   s a disconnect here.  There   s a disconnect. There   s so much of that.  Would I encourage somebody to go into farming today? No, I wouldn   t.  If they owned the land, they might be able to make it, but if they   re  having to rent the land and buy their own machinery, even with the  government subsidy I don   t think they   re going to be able to do it. I  heard a guy say the other day if wheat prices stay at five dollars or below  six dollars, it   ll be seven years before machinery prices start coming  down. You can   t buy a  200,000 tractor and a  350,000 combine on   5.50 wheat. You   d have to raise a hundred bushel to the acre. One year  on one farm, I raised seventy-four bushel to the acre. The year before  4 9  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  that, that particular farm made zero because of drought or late freeze.  You just can   t do it.  You can do everything right, and it still goes so south that   s it   s just  unbelievable.  When my dad moved to Enid, all of a sudden everybody needed a crop  consultant. That was a new avenue for somebody to make money:  become a crop consultant. My dad hired one. I didn   t know it. I didn   t  know I was going to be the one paying the bill for it. The cost was one  bushel of wheat per acre, the price of wheat on the thirty-first of  December of that year after harvest. The crop consultant, he came out,  he took soil samples, recommended what fertilizer you needed to put on.  He came out and checked for bugs, whether you needed to spray or not  to spray, gave you yield estimates. Two weeks before harvest, my yield  estimates were forty-two bushels to the acre. I lost seven quarters to hail.  The other five quarters that I was farming made forty-two bushel to the  acre. I paid him for forty-two bushels an acre on every acre I farmed, not  on what I cut.  Oh, what a rip off. (Laughs)  I told my dad,    Don   t ever sign me up for something you   re not paying  for. I don   t care how good the crop consultant is, how much effort you  put into doing what he says to do. If it hails or it doesn   t rain or it rains  too much, it doesn   t make a flip.    The year my mother died, I got the  best revenue I   d ever gotten in my life while farming, and it was all crop  insurance.  Because it was a wet year.  I never cut an acre, and they gave me zero bushels on every acre I  farmed, not quite every acre.  That   s that year that it was so wet that you couldn   t get in. It literally  rotted in the fields.  Even the guy coming out     Direct opposite of last year.  The guy coming out to inspect the fields to estimate what the yield was  going to be would take one step into the field and sink up to his knee. He  says,    I   m not coming back until it dries up.    He was coming from  Texas. He came three different times that harvest, and it was always too  wet. That was the first time my dad had been farming   he was still alive  5 0  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  then. I believe he was eighty-five or -six years old, and he   d never seen  wheat sprout in the head. That year it did.  You know, it sounds   just listening     He   d heard of it, but he   d never seen it.     when he says,    I wouldn   t advise anyone to come farm,    don   t  misunderstand that. It   s been a remarkable life and all that. There   s so  much left up to nature, and it is a laboriously grueling lifestyle. You   re  literally, to make it managed correctly, you   re always working,  particularly with no help. To just say right out,    I wouldn   t recommend  anybody to do this    sounds very harsh, but would I recommend my son  to come back and farm? No. I wouldn   t, either. There   s too much work  involved, you know, if you want to truly go on your vacations and relax  when you do it.  And no guarantee.  Yeah, and no guarantee.  Not only that, like I said before, you can   t because you can   t rely on the  people that you hired to take care of it while you   re gone to do it.  You don   t know how many times we   ve sat back and gone,    I just wish  somebody could come in and help while we were gone, just to   .     I had my knee operated on two years ago, and I hired a guy to look after  my cows because it was during calving season. He had cows of his own,  so I assumed he knew what he was doing. I   d never lost a baby calf in  fifteen years, I don   t suppose, to illness. I   d lost one to a coyote, maybe,  or to abortion or something like that. I lost three calves in two weeks,  and I was paying him to take care of them. He said,    Well, I never did  see any baby calves on the ground.    That   s the kind of help you can  expect now.  So it burns you, and then you don   t go.  Like I said, if you have family farming where you can depend on family  to take care of things when you   re gone, yeah, and they enjoy it, yeah, I  would encourage my son to farm if that   s what I knew he   d like to do,  but he   s a gregarious guy. He likes to go to concerts and do things like  that, and you just don   t have time. I don   t have time. I don   t think I have  time. Maybe it   s a matter of priorities, I know, but I don   t think I have  time to do those things.  5 1  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  And they don   t have them in Jet.  No, they don   t have them in Jet.  You have to travel. We went to Oklahoma City yesterday, and we  thought we   d never get home. (Laughter)  Even to go to Enid, I   ve got to go thirty-six miles now just to buy parts.  Any direction I go, it   s thirty-six miles. There   s one John Deere house.  Well, there   s two within thirty-six miles. One Case dealership within  thirty-six miles. That   s it. We got to talking about daylight savings time.  Farmers hate daylight savings time. We work from sunup to sunset,  regardless of what the clock says. When it   s five o   clock in daylight  savings time, it   s actually only four o   clock. You have a breakdown,  you   ve got to wait until the next morning to find somebody open, and  you   ve lost six hours of sunlight, basically, not six but three or four  hours of sunlight because you can   t go buy a part because they   re closed.  Was there ever a time during your father   s life or your time farming that  you thought you were going to lose the farm?  Our daughter went through some ill health at one time, and monetarily,  we dipped into our savings and had to pull monies that we really didn   t  want to. That was really   we had some tough years.  At that time, I had bought two farms on thirty-year loans through FHA  and farm credit. I actually had to go to FHA and refinance because I  couldn   t make a payment to pay the doctors    fees, to pay the hospital  bills. Yeah, I didn   t know whether we were going to come out of that or  not.  But I never actually thought we were going to lose the farm. We  would   ve managed to round out somehow.  Well, that   s because you didn   t know everything. (Laughs)  Probably.  That   s probably one of the things that I   ve done wrong is I have not let  her have those kind of worries. I haven   t told her,    You can   t go buy  that. We can   t do that.    Sometimes I wished I had told her that. I   ve had  to borrow a lot of money, but I   ve never had to refinance a loan with my  bank. I   ve always been able to pay   I may have to take a new loan out  the next day, but I   ve always been able to pay it off. Not too many  people can really say that, but we didn   t do a lot of things that other  people did. We didn   t get refinanced. I had some neighbors and some  5 2  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  friends that were going to   I don   t know whether y   all remember the  farm credit crunch here a while back, and people got their loans written  down and some of them totally forgiven. I had some friends that had  bought  250,000 farms, and they couldn   t pay for them. They couldn   t  make their payments. Farm credit service wrote them down, forgave it.  It was not fair.  One guy had to sell off his machinery to the bank, and he was mad  because   and he could buy it back. This is the sad part of it. He was  allowed to bid on it and buy it back for half the cost of it. Then he got  mad at his neighbor for buying a piece of the machinery from him that  he bought back at half price of what he owed for it. On the land, we had  some well-to-do people that actually got their debts forgiven on land,  and within a month turned around and bought a  150,000 farm.  That was in the   80s, wasn   t it?  Yeah.  It was the farm credit scandal.  I went back, because I was buying land, through farm credit. I   ve never  been late on a payment. I   ve never missed a payment. I went and said,     What do you have to do to qualify for this? If it   s fair for the goose,  why isn   t it fair for the gander? Why is everybody being able to write  their loans down?    He said,    You   ve never been late, or you   ve never  missed a payment.    I said,    Well, that   s easy to fix.     Yeah, I can miss a payment. Tell me which one.  His comment to me was,    And we   ll foreclose on you.    That   s wrong. In  that time period, there were farmers all across the United States going  bankrupt. A lot of them committed suicide. It just wasn   t fair. My deal  has always been,    I signed the paperwork, that   s my debt, and I   m going  to do everything I can to pay for it. If they end up taking the land, then  that   s what the consequences are.    When they started writing things  down and giving people breaks and they wouldn   t do it for everybody,  that was just wrong.  It was just wrong.  I went to the Federal Land Bank, and I told the board of directors what I  felt of them. I didn   t mince any words. They said,    It   s the law.  Congress has allowed us to do that, and you didn   t qualify because  you   ve never missed a payment. When you said,    That   s easy to do,    we  5 3  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  Finchum  P. Thornburgh  know you can do it.    This particular family that I was talking about that  had their  250,000 farms written down and forgiven and bought most of  his machinery back at a third of what the actual value of it was, every  year he went fishing off the coast of Florida. He had swimming pool in  his back yard. I didn   t have any of that stuff.  Well, but you could sleep at night.  That   s true.  And you had a pond.  Yes.  One time, actually, we filled that in because we were afraid the kids  would fall in it. Now we have grandkids, (we   ve talked about) but they  get such a big kick out of the little fish that are in it that we keep  maintaining it.  Well, is there any oil going on, on your property that you have?  That   s a really sore spot. (Laughter) I   ll tell you why. The oil boom  made everybody around here healthy. When they started leasing, 1978 I  believe, I bought one of my grandmother   s farms. When she died, the  estate was settled, and one of her pieces of property came up for sale,  and I bought it. I was the only one that bid on it. I paid  120,000 for it  which was about  20,000 more than anything at that time was going for,  but it was in the family. At that time, if a piece of property, a family   s  piece of property, sold and somebody in the family wanted to buy it,  nobody would bid against them. I thought it was too high, but my dad  said that   s what it   s going to take to get it, so I made that bid, and  nobody bid against me.  I had a neighbor who was not from here come up to me after and said,    I  don   t know how you bought that so cheap.    I said to him,    If you  wanted it, why didn   t you buy it?    He said,    Let me put it this way. If  I   d have had the money, I would   ve. I don   t understand why somebody  didn   t bid against you.    I said,    It   s tradition and respect for the family.     He said,    I don   t care if my mother would   ve wanted it and I wanted it.  I   d have bid against her.    That   s the mentality now with the younger  generation. There   s no loyalty. There   s no loyalty to the co-ops. You can  go on the internet and buy anything you want to buy, and you can buy it  cheaper than you can locally. By the same token, when they need a tire  changed or an oil change or they want something today, they can   t wait  until tomorrow to get it. Then they want to co-op to be there.  5 4  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  Nykolaiszyn  P. Thornburgh  J. Thornburgh  P. Thornburgh  That   s what internet   s doing to everything. Our local stores are     When I was president of the board at the Jet co-op before we became  part of Dacoma  co-op , we started having local farmers that didn   t ever  own anything but a bobtail truck. All of a sudden they   re semis. They  own semis. They   d take their wheat straight to Enid and bypass the local  co-op. Wheat is a local co-op   s   storage is the foundation of what  they   re based on. That   s the only thing that keeps them alive is their  storage income.  The same farmer that told me he didn   t care if it was his mother, he   d  bid against  her , at that meeting I didn   t mention any names. I just said,     There are those of you in our community now that are bypassing the  local co-op, but you want the ti
