 Little Thunder  Whitman  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, March 10,  2011. I   m interviewing Richard Whitman as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project for the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program  at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Richard   s studio in Oklahoma  City. Richard, you   re a multi-media artist who has used your work to  draw attention to social issues, land resources and Native language for  a long time. Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Thank you Julie.  Speaks in Yuchi language.  I said,    Good afternoon.  You   re welcome.    I will be speaking in English. I speak your language  as well. (Laughs) I am from a little community,    Tso Ya Ha,    we call  ourselves in our language. I am from a little community, Gypsy,  Oklahoma. South of Bristow, Creek County. Iron Post, Sand Creek  ceremonial ground, Mutteloke Methodist Church. I was born in  Claremore. Claremore Indian Hospital. I spent some early summers in  Pawnee, Red Rock, Oklahoma, but my orientation, how I began, is from  Gypsy, Oklahoma in a Yuchi household. Quite often, I   m asked if I  consider myself an Indian artist, a traditional Indian artist, an artist first  or Native artist, artist-at-large. For me, it   s already a given, in the sense  of what I was born into, my birthright as a Yuchi being, and from there I  can become anything. So I was raised in a Yuchi household, a non-nuclear  family if you will. And Yuchi language was the language of the  household.  That is wonderful because there aren   t a whole lot of Yuchi speakers, as  I understand it.  Yes. Very threatened language, endangered language. But a great  program going on, an immersion program like a lot of tribal peoples,  tribal language groups    immersion programs: Tso Ya Ha. We have one  that   s making ground.  5  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  You are Yuchi and Pawnee but you were raised Yuchi. Not a lot of  exposure to the Pawnee side of your family. What is your first art  experience you remember, growing up?  Well, once again, I would say it goes back. Of course, today I   m a visual  artist. I feel sometimes that can be a challenge. We can place limitations  on ourselves by  using the words     visual artist    in a sense. I   m an artist.  Of course, I grew up with Big Chief tablets, too, in grade school.  (Laughs)  Did a lot of drawing?  Drawing I guess was  part of it . But I think the nonnuclear family     I remember it was a very crowded little shotgun house. And different  people would be staying with us, so it was the extended family. It was  only when I went to first or second grade in elementary school that I saw  the nuclear family. In the little books   Father, Mother, Dick, Sally,  Spot, Puff, the pure nuclear family. I would see that and then I would go  home. (Laughs) So, I would say that   s how I began     With your mom   s parents,  your grandparents .  Right. And I spent a great deal of time outdoors. Now when I think  about it,  I had  a great deal of freedom. Playing outdoors, drawing in  the sand. We didn   t have big bookshelves. There were no references to  the European Masters. If there were any books, they weren   t in the  home. It was obviously, a different kind of education.  Did your grandma or your mom sew?  Oh yes. Great quilts. It was that kind of hand making, creating whatever  was at hand to create with. Weaving strips. My grandmother was very  practical and very crafty.  What experiences with art did you have in public school?  Very limited. I mean the arts   in my high school it was very limited.  My art teacher was actually the assistant football coach. So if you  performed well on the football field, that was the main criteria. This is  Oklahoma, you know. It was football and sports. The other options were  band or music. But really, my first reference in grade school was like  Mad magazine. Mad magazine was really my art.  6  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Comic books?  Comic books. My art bible was Mad magazine:    What, me worry?     (Laughs) A little later in my life,  it  would be not my motto. (Laughs) A  great boost.  What about your first exposure to traditional or flat-style Indian  painting? Do you remember some of the first works of Indian art you  saw?  Of course. Obviously around high school, it was Jerome Tiger. I  would go to the Philbrook Art show in the    60s. The Annual.  Did you enter the Annual?  Well, by then I have arrived in Santa Fe. In    68. We submitted work to   Philbrook  and tried to open up  things . I remember Rance Hood and  Fred Beaver were real flat. But then I began to say,    Why?    It was  something that I couldn   t really relate to. You want to respect it, but I  felt it very limiting, too. Because I had arrived in Santa Fe at that time,  in the    60s. I don   t know. When they say traditional art, I say, in some  real ways, I grew up in what you would say traditional art. I grew up  with an outdoor shitter and a shotgun house. And a language first  besides English. We were poor and we didn   t know it. As you get older,  you are poor and you do know it, or you quickly get sensitized. So, I  began to see the inequities, I guess.  When did you kind of start thinking of yourself as an artist? Was it  before you went to the Institute? How old were you?  I didn   t really embrace being an artist. Of course, then it was not  encouraged during the Vietnam War. My older brother was in Vietnam.  It was the military code   couldn   t draft the next surviving son, so I  really had to consider joining the armed services. It was our way, the  community. I don   t know if it was a matter of being overly patriotic, but  it was a way out. For me, it was to go to Okmulgee Tech or go to Tulsa  Welding School, or pump gas, or work for the local farmer, rancher.  Nothing wrong with that, but something took me out of there, away from  there, and  that  was the arts. It was a 1969 copy of Life magazine.  (Laughs) I researched and found that it was the first issue of Life that  ever had  a work of art on the cover . It was always a photographic  cover magazine, totally a photo magazine, Life magazine. That cover  was an Indian cover with a graphic design done by a student from the  IAIA  Institute of American Indian Arts . It was the    60s. It was the  7  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  counter, alternative counter-culture    60s. Music, drugs, lifestyle and the  Vietnam War. But in that issue was a sixteen page layout spread on the  Institute of American Indian Arts. So it was very intriguing to me. They  would accept you at that time with a bad high school transcript. I could  handily supply that. (Laughs) They also went on the merit of your  portfolio. So that was a great balance for me.  You had to submit drawings?  Yeah, samples of your work. Portfolio. And, reluctantly, the high school  transcript. (Laughs)  So you went in your senior year?  Yes, my graduating year was    67 and I messed up my senior year, so I  didn   t graduate until    68. I belong to two graduating classes. (Laughs)  What aspects of the Institute stood out for you while you were there?  Well, it was the late    60s, it was a dynamic time. Here was this school,  an art institute, a culture institute created in 1962 with the concept of  embracing your culture, building from it, exploring with it, embracing it.  A total departure from the whole Indian boarding school. Remake you.  Kill the Indian in you. It was a new, really, a radical idea. Fortunately  for me, I arrived in a great time there, the    60s, with like-minded fellow  students from reservations, urban areas, Oklahoma, Indian Country. Just  sort of a wide range of backgrounds, tribal affiliations and great  energies. It was really a great time, when I think about it, to explore.  Who were some of the students you hung out with? Some of your  classmates?  Well, it was like I said, during the Vietnam War, I always say I literally  met T.C. Canon through his letters. He was in Vietnam. He would write  letters back to the Institute of American Indian Arts to be read and  shared with the studios. So I was volunteered, or asked, to read his  letters in the studios. Advanced, Intermediate, Beginning Painting. And  actually, we read them in dorm meetings, and just general gatherings on  campus, student assemblies. I would read his letters. Then I met him in  person a couple years later.  I hope the school kept those letters.  Yeah, I think his estate today, his sister and many friends, treasure those  letters. Fellow students for me, I guess, would be Dan Namingha. He  owns his own gallery in Santa Fe. He   s successful, in the sense of a  8  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  presence in the art world. And economically.  I saw a picture of you with Gina Gray     Oh, Gina Gray. I remember Gina Gray, Earl Biss, Kevin Red Star. The  IAIA alumni. But a great many artists    it   s a very small percentile of  artists who can make a direct living from their work. You must have  another livelihood. Or the great pie in the sky, inheritance. Something to  carry it. (Laughs)  From time to time, I have the occasion to meet someone from that era,  the    60s. We   re always asking about so and so. Who has gone on,  deceased or passed on. We always ask who is still making art from our  time, our era. And we wonder about certain people.    Wow, he was a  great artist, a great sculptor. What happened?       Well, last time I heard of  him he was in the oilfields. Couldn   t make a direct living from his  work.    You always wonder about people. I do. There were some really  great energies, and their work was left there, in the collection. Some  people have had to move on to other livelihoods and circumstances.  What subjects did you focus on while you were there?  Well, I rarely went to class. (Laughs) No. My first teacher was Otellie  Loloma, a Hopi, at the time was married to Charles Loloma. Very  interesting concept by the IAIA. They hired   their faculty/staff was  really working artists. Allan Houser, Charles Loloma. And they  balanced it with degreed or trained, teaching-certified art teachers. It was  a great balance because  when  you   re talking about Charles Loloma,   he   s  renowned. Turned jewelry around. And of course, Allan Houser   s  story is his own, for sculpture. I arrived there just in time. I caught Fritz  Scholder,   68- 69, in a drawing class and beginning painting. That was  good   the faculty of artists. I think I was very influenced as well as my  fellow students by encouragement of your painting instructor. But, I  began with Otellie Loloma, Hopi, and moved across the hall to Fritz  Scholder. I remember walking to the studio once when I arrived and  there was some music of the time playing. Sixties rock, drug-infused,  with these huge canvases. Scale   seven, eight foot paintings. (Laughs)  That was before headphones. Very alive, the energy. Huge, broad  brushes. Supplies were made available. Canvas, huge rolls of canvas,  acrylic, oils, brushes. Then across the hall was, well, I wouldn   t say  traditional painting, but there was Indian music playing. It was different  but great energy as well. And there I was.  It was hard not to   I would wander back and forth. Great energy, visual  energy, visual language.  Before IAIA, I used to think  to be an artist  you almost had to be a painter, but arriving there you see all these other  9  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  mediums, other disciplines.  What about photography? Did you study it formally at the Institute?  No. There was Kay Weist. She was a professional photographer as well.  Sort of the Ansel Adams School, New Mexico. It was sort of the  yearbook, campus paper, newspaper, staff, students. Photography     she did offer it. It was only a few years later that I really explored it. I  began as a painter, you know. I was very insecure about  my  artist   ideal . (Laughs) To be a painter or a sculptor. (Laughs) Then there was  jewelry. Of course, IAIA offered creative writing, drama, theater, dance.  Did you participate in the theater program or creative writing?  Yeah, creative writing. I got in there for a couple of years, a couple  semesters. Of course, the dance teacher was always trying to encourage   us, but  we were too masculine   We were too manly. (Laughs) Too  manly, masculine. We can   t do that. (Laughs) But there were some great  dancers, traditional dancers. And then, modern dance. When I think  about that, we sort of impose  our  own limitations because you feel  threatened or you are not strong enough or free enough. But a couple  years later, I sort of embraced it. And I sought out photography, as well.  You went to Wounded Knee in 1973 and that was sort of a turning point  for you, I guess. First, let   s go to Cal  Arts . You transferred  there .  California City Arts. They came recruiting to Santa Fe. I forget how  many that year signed up to go to Cal Arts. Of course, when I arrived  there, I realized some of the students didn   t show up. That was    72, I  think. Prior to that, I was living in Santa Fe. We   d finished school and  there was a community film project that came out of Chicago,  Philadelphia, New York City, and it picked certain cities for the Black  community, Black film makers, Latinos. And Santa Fe was selected     the IAIA, their campus   was selected to host this community film  workshop to encourage or train young Native film makers. George  Bordeaux, Blackfoot, early    60s IAIA alum, was the director/instructor.  We hooked onto that program, so I stuck around for    71-   72 and was  living there. Did the starving artist thing. But the community film  workshop was great.  Then this recruiter came from Cal Arts. We met him. He looked at the  portfolios and our work, so we got accepted. And I, of course, was so  idealistic and so egotistical that I thought I was accepted totally on the  merit of my portfolio. When I arrived, I realized they were meeting their  minority quota as well. They didn   t have any Native Americans in their  student population. (Laughs) Some students showed up and some didn   t.  10  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  I felt a little alone there. But a great school. I learned later that it was a  very prestigious school, Cal Arts. Even today. At the time, I felt a little  alienated. If just a couple more students would have shown up     Then, instead of a full scholarship, it was based on that one semester.  The second semester, my tribe, the Muscogee Creek Nation, wouldn   t  fund my balance of tuition because it was an out-of-state school. And an  arts school at that  (Laughs)    We will send you to pipe fitting school in  Chicago, but art school? Come on.    But anyway, Cal Arts was really a  good experience. It got me to Los Angeles. Ran into long lost cousins  who had signed up for relocation in the    50s. I basically hadn   t seen  some of these people since they left our community in grade school,    55,     56 and    57. When I ran into them they were students at UCLA.  (Laughs) Came back to Oklahoma summers to visit every few years.  They basically grew up in Los Angeles, greater Los Angeles. A huge  urban Indian community, historically. Los Angeles Indian Center. It was  really another step for me.  So that was just as much as an education as the Cal  Arts  classes?  Yeah, you know, I think Gypsy to Santa Fe, those are my stepping  stones. Santa Fe to Los Angeles     When did you get a hold of a camera?  When I left Santa Fe.    70-   71. A great pawn shop camera,  25   Rolliflex , double reflex lens, I guess. But the community film  workshop provided us with cameras. There was a Bolex sixteen  millimeter  film camera . So that was a great intro, that community film  workshop with George Bordeaux. That was a great model for a number  of years. Really got the possibilities of being behind the camera. We  were so ready to be in front of the camera always. (Laughs) Dandied up  for the cameras. (Laughs)  Was the next kind of pivotal moment when you went to Wounded Knee in     73?  Definitely. But then, I was in this limbo because of no funding for the  second semester  of school . I was going down to L.A. because Cal Arts  was north of Los Angeles, Valencia, Newhall area, so I would catch a  bus or catch a ride with some student in a car. Sometimes my cousin  Gladys Big Pond and them would come to Cal Arts and pick me up. So,  I started spending more and more time in L.A. Then I went to this  meeting at UCLA and Wounded Knee was on T.V. for the second or  third day. And there was this media blackout of it. They had a meeting  off-campus, some non-students   it was this big meeting one evening. I  11  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  went and that night two or three women, actually, Native women, stood  up and said,    We are going to drive up tonight. If any of you men        They challenged you.  Yeah, that was a great challenge. It was this media blackout essentially.  We went. They set a time to come back, a meeting place. Three or four  cars drove out of L.A. I had a jean jacket and t-shirt. Woke up and we  were in Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada. Next thing was Nebraska. It was  another very pivotal stepping stone in my life at that time. In the sense of  an artist, cultural worker, it really made me. By then, I realized out of  the Santa Fe experience, a strong case for being an artist. The political  ramifications of being an artist as well. When one looks around the  world, you see artists. I began to look in Guatemala and Central and  South America. The Indigenous struggles there, for me, were artists.  The writers, community cultural activists were always in the forefront of  those struggles, even today. For the most part, those are the ones that  were arrested, incarcerated, murdered, so I began to see the real power  of     Of art that takes on issues.  Yeah, art that has a greater capacity. It   s not just necessarily art to sell,  art for the gallery, art to hang above the sofa. I   m not downplaying them.  I   m just saying art is much bigger. I hadn   t known that. The experience  at Wounded Knee   a number of IAIA alumni arrived there and were  there in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The alumni from there that I met, on  their land, on their turf, if you will, it was another way of meeting them,  being supportive, their guests. To stand with them and to re-meet, even  after being students in Santa Fe at IAIA.  One of the first works of art that I saw by you was the Street Chief  series. Can you explain the term, Street Chief, and talk about what  inspired that series for you?  I think the time was when I returned from Wounded Knee,    73. Prior to  that, I   d ridden a Greyhound bus from here to Santa Fe in    68. And  Tulsa to Oklahoma City, Amarillo, Albuquerque. But the stopover in  Oklahoma City   the Greyhound bus station was near downtown,  Sheridan and Reno. Skid Row, if you will. Very high, visible numbers of  Native people. And when I returned from Wounded Knee, I was seeking  my mother. She had an address in Oklahoma City, and that   s how I  arrived in Oklahoma City. It was before Native American Centers or  American Indian Centers or urban centers for Native people, so really,  the first place to go inquire about someone, you go to an Indian bar. I  did.    Do you know so and so? I   m so and so   s son.    They would come  12  in and they would make some reference. It was part of the network  before there was any established social advocacy centers. So, I found  this address for my mother, but it was on Skid Row. I had this old  camera, beginner   s camera   one was confiscated at Wounded Knee, my  Pentax 1000. A beginner   s camera, the ultimate. No distractions, just  point and (gestures). My friends always tease me that my first collectors  were the F.B.I. (Laughs) Confiscated my little Pentax and about a dozen  rolls of black and white film. We filed for it several times but it was  never returned. Good luck. And I had photos from the inside   But I landed another camera, I began to pack a camera. I would go down  on the streets   I did the whole thing, myself, on the streets. The plas ma  center  in the daytime. Hustle, scuffle on the streets. But I remember this  voice   those store fronts are all torn out now, all these empty store  fronts and Skid Row bars   and this voice came out of this little dark  doorway. And it was in the Yuchi language. (Speaking Yuchi.)    Where  do you think you   re going?    or something like that. This person  recognized me, but it was in the language, so it caught me. I stepped  back (Speaking Yuchi)    You know me?    And there was this man   he  would disappear from our community from time to time. He had enough  respect for his family and their name, that when he would go on his  binges   and he was an alcoholic   he would get out of the way from the  community. He would go to Tulsa or Oklahoma City, so he could blend  in. Be anonymous in a way. He would go for months, and then he would  come back. It was him. Big Jake. He teased me and I gave him some  change. Then I begin to see there were several tribal affiliated people  sharing the jug. Seeing these beautiful men with their own histories. It  was something I didn   t understand. I think I was drawn to it in a way I  didn   t know at the time. I still don   t know what moved me. I didn   t have  any intentions of that becoming the Street Chiefs  series .  And there was a lot of mistrust of me, of the camera. They didn   t know  what I was up to, what I was using this for. Even though I was Native  myself, with the camera was still a mistrust. It took me years, just being  there myself. I think I was drawn to them because it was something I  didn   t understand. I didn   t understand the circumstances. How you could  be homeless? A lifeway   style, if you will. Homeless or vagrant or  down and out? Because they came from a rural community. It was  supportive, even though families   it was supportive. I didn   t understand  it for the most part. When I think about it now, I think I didn   t  understand it. I was drawn to that. Not to romanticize it. I didn   t want to  be like that. But I didn   t also want to be judgmental. That was always  my concern, for it to be non-judgmental with the lens. When I revisit  some of the photos, I look at those men and I remember them. They  helped me. I remember they looked right back at me. They looked right  at me. And it was not necessarily just through the lens, in a mechanical  13  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  way, it was     Connecting. You said something really eloquent, that you reject  comparisons other social photographers like Dorothea Lange.    I am not  a visitor to my experience and I do not leave that world when I finish  shooting.     One  photo I would like for you talk about a little bit was  this Indian man on the street, standing underneath that sign that says     Buy Oklahoma.     It had to be in the late    70s, the Department of Commerce, Department  of Agriculture, someone had this promotion.    Buy Oklahoma.    Of  course, it was a cowboy and Indian logo, but I had seen the billboard on  numerous sites  and  I shot it by itself. But this particular man I had  befriended, he was a Kiowa man. He was in some earlier images. I titled  him    Street Patriarch.    I knew him. I began to know these men over the  years. They came from these great lineages, great family. Descendants  of chiefs. Great histories. Their own personal histories, for that matter.  But that day I caught him   because this billboard is near this recycling,  aluminum recycling, where they sell cans and whatever they find.  And   by the time I turned around, he was coming. He was there. I didn   t go  get him and stage him. There was a little aluminum recycle place, and he  was on his way back from there. (Laughs) I turned around and there was  the billboard. I had forgotten about that. And there he was. I said,     Wow.    Serendipity. He was just there. Bam   I was amazed. Of course, context is always important in anything.  Politics, history, life in general. Arts for sure. I remember there was an  exhibition, it was touring across the country. It originated in the East  Coast. Homeless in America. Basically, the focus was urban  homelessness. Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, then the West Coast. It  was coming through here, to the Oklahoma Photography Museum. So I  tried to hook on my Street Chiefs. We finally worked it out, but once  again it was context. They said,    What   s special about this? Native  homelessness   aside from the obvious contradiction. Homeless in your  own homeland.    That   s what  it is   Context. Historical displacement   Just as I was arriving in Oklahoma, there are a handful of indigenous   people living on the street . We make this our home. Context. Finally I  had to stand by the work and explain it. There is always a risk of over-explaining,  but sometimes it   s necessary. They let me hook on. Gave me  a space with the traveling exhibit, so it was good in that sense. It was the  Buy Oklahoma. I built it around that image for my arguing points.  (Laughs)  Were you able to make any kind of living from the sale of some of those  photographs in the early days?  14  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  No. Even today, I try to keep them together. I wanted them to remain  together. Very helpful for me in the    80s was Edgar Heap of Birds, who  had seen the work and said,    You need to get it out there. It needs to be  shared.  It   s  a way to push, not just push your work, but push the  perimeters of the photography or art or Native art.    He was very  encouraging and managed some sites and made some real relevant  connections for me in terms of some art organizations, art spaces.  So you started connecting with museums and institutions a little bit  more?  Some Native curators and probably Native artists argued that I was  showing a negative side of their Indian culture.  But others understood  the work in the larger context of being homeless in your own mind.   But no, I never made any money. And it was never my intent. I don   t  know how one makes money. (Laughs) But if you do, is it too late for  me? (Laughs) Can I cut a deal here? (Laughs)  It   s kind of like there are these parallel worlds, work that has a  commercial market, a big mass audience.  And  then there is this other  kind of work, equally important. And it   s a struggle to survive to do that  kind of work.  Unfortunately, I am one of those artists. I think you   re right. The photo,  the image, the subject, can move you, make you feel.  The sign  Buy  Oklahoma is a visual image, so it makes you want to see. Then it makes  you curious. So it   s a way of engaging you, the viewer. I think the work  is successful in a sense, perhaps not economically successful. I   m not a  purist, and I   m definitely not a romantic about that because it was a  disturbing scenario, disturbing circumstance to me. I definitely didn   t  want the work to be romanticized or the subject or that circumstance.  But I wanted it to be explored, to be considered.  Over the years, since the    70s,    80s, this work on the Street Chiefs   I   d  meet a grandson or a granddaughter  who   d say ,    That was my  grandfather. That was my grandma   s brother,    or so. Or aunt. For me,  when I think about it now, those kinds of returns, from descendants, they  can identify with that particular person in a photo. In some cases it may  be their only reference to that person. I think that   s important, even if I  never knew some sides of my family. So, to see a photograph of my  grandfather once in the Sapulpa Historical Society   Martha Wildcat,  one of our elders, she gave me this small photo twenty years ago, and  said,    This is your grandpa, Long George. Old Man Long George.    I had  never seen him. He had passed on before I came along. It may have been  an anonymous historical photo from the Historical Society, but me, I  15  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  can make the connection. So, I think from time to time, the possibilities  of that  are  helpful. In that sense, I   m not a pure photographer or a pure  portrait photographer or fine art photographer. It   s a medium to be used,  a medium to enhance mixed media or multimedia.  Your Homeland series, which came out I guess in    92, or was exhibited   then , were those all collages?  The Homeland series, they were kind of box constructions, too. Photo,  painting, collage, text. I   m very big on this in the latter part of my life, as  I   ve matured. (Laughter) I think it   s about not just my tribal mythology  as a Yuchi citizen, but my personal mythology as well, or one   s lived  experience. So those collages came from that. I began to look at myself,  where   s my pie in the sky? I am waiting for my great inheritance. How  am I participating and sort of promoting my own demise here?  In what way?  I mean, in the sense of not having any political awareness, just sort of  the top side. The context. In my personal family, not having access to  land to build on, to live on. Part of that Homeland series is about the  homeland, before the very popular image, poster and t-shirt  came out .  Homeland Security and fighting terrorism. I think one looks abroad and  you look at the world, the lack of world peace. But then, actually, one  must look at their own backyard.  So there   s work  to do ? Decolonizing the mind?  Right, exactly. That   s what made my own personal mythology. It   s  about working on myself, and then going to work on others. But one  must work on themselves without being totally   I haven   t declared my  self-importance here, lately, through any project. (Laughs) I think one  has to be responsible for their work. If one says one is an artist, writer,  photographer, poet or whatever, then one should be it. I don   t mean that  to be bounding or binding. In the same way, if one claims to be Native  American, one should be it. I have plenty of friends, close friends, artist  friends   I never had to worry about making that declaration. I think one  must work on themselves.  There   s a much smaller circle of artists doing this kind of cultural,  political kind of activist art. Has it been really helpful to have  friendships with those artists?  Oh yes, definitely. It is very lonely out here on the prairie. (Laughs) It is.  Edgar  Heap of Birds  formed this artist co-op. It   s called The Makers.  Pat Mousetrail, Shan Goshorn. Photography, beadwork, painting and  16  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  writing, and conceptual  art . In what ways is art not conceptual to begin  with? It   s always very helpful here in Oklahoma because one is totally  surrounded, at times, by the pure art marketing aspects. I don   t argue  that. People who are trying to provide and make a go of it. But I will  argue for the point that one should be open to other possibilities and not  limit one   s self.  What museums have purchased your work for their permanent  collections?  IAIA. I think Dartmouth. I   m still waiting, it   s pending, the National  Museum of the American Indian. It   s pending. They promised to revisit  my work. With the budget cuts, you know. I am waiting for the great  casino in the sky. (Laughs) The great pie-in-the sky casino.  Do you feel you   re well represented in Oklahoma or better represented  outside of Oklahoma?  Probably outside of Oklahoma. It   s the old proverb, what was it?  You   re never a prophet in your own country. (Laughter) I know that one.  Such a clich  . But I   m appreciated just enough by my family and  grandchildren, so that   s what keeps me  going . It   s encouraging, from  time to time, to see that the work can be far-reaching.  Have you  taught  workshops in art?  Oh, yeah, I was on the roster for the State Art Council for many years in  the    80s.  Photography and painting?  And creative writing and mixed media. Short of art therapy. That   s what  I meant by one   s personal mythology. Art is a vehicle   it can be  therapeutic in a sense. For me, it   s an alone endeavor, not necessarily a  lonely one. Workshops   it was a great program, the art in the school,  because you subcontract the work. Then you are self-employing  yourself. It   s a contract with the school or whatever site you opt for. It  gives you the balance, how much work you want to take on, and how  much you want to pursue your own work.  That was important to me. Early on, even from the Native American  Center days, my single greatest provider when I had a young family  starting and  was  still trying to keep my art was Native American  Centers hiring us as youth counselors using art. Substance abuse  17  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  programs or these drop out programs trying to build some model  for the  future . At one point, I told my children,    I want to go full-time, trying  to pursue my work. It   s my love.    We certainly had some harder times  then, but the Arts Council came through, so it was very helpful. A good,  relative pay scale for services. I signed up for programs behind the  walls, penal systems, alternative schools, substance abuse, and senior  citizen centers. So, it was fulfilling in that sense.  It brought something back to your artwork?  Yeah, it helped pay some bills, but the real part of it was the outreach.  Not necessarily people who, how do I say it, pursue arts because they  think it is some kind of leisure activity, a hobby or something. It can be  more. It can be revealing. It can be sensitive and for your own self. It  doesn   t necessarily have to be shared. It can be encouraging in that  sense. You don   t have to be a pure artist in that way. It is okay to do it   for yourself .  You had a one-man show at the Museum of the American Indian  at the  Smithsonian . What year was that?  2003, I think. What was the title of the exhibit? It was sort of a transition  show for the opening of the new museum in D.C. It was a site in New  York. It was really good company because you got selected. It was a  great honor for me.  I had these great ideas  for submissions , but I couldn   t realize them  because I didn   t have the finances, the money. There is a great curator at  the museum. He called me and said,    Your name is in this mix.    Truman  Lowe. He   s Ho-Chunk Winnebago. He was the curator at the museum  there. He was also head of the art department at the University of  Wisconsin-Madison. I   ve always been a fan of his work and his great  wit, his great Winnebago Ho-Chunk humor. (Laughs) But he called me,  and I was very open and honest with him.    I don   t have the money to  realize  the project . I   ve got the ideas and the concepts and the images I  want, but I don   t have the proceeds.    So, he said,    Don   t worry. That  doesn   t matter. Just agree to do this.    Basically he just calls me and says,     What are you thinking?    (Laughs)  So he bought into your project, provided some funding?  He said,    Come. I   ll make some arrangements.    So I went to the  University of Wisconsin as a visiting artist. They had a great digital  program there and with assistants. It was great.  What was the project that you ultimately contributed to the show?  18  Whitman  It was a photo-based image, but it was part of this other narrative. It was  a series. Actually, when I got the call from Truman  that  my name was  in the mix and being considered and narrowed down, I was going  through a time with my sobriety and some issues. I had just come off  one of my five hundred year old binges, and was sitting on my front  porch alone. Those of us in the know have experienced that. You begin  to bottom out, it doesn   t matter who you are, what you are. But the call  came from this great man, this great voice, Truman Lowe, this Ho-  Chunk. He has a Trickster   s quality in his voice. (Laughs) But earlier  that evening I had these experiences   and I had the great opportunity to  relate it back to Truman. It was this evening storm going up in  Oklahoma. Summer storm. Across the street from me was all these  leaves. And a little whirlwind began to happen there, in that front yard  across the street from me. It turned and turned and turned and began to  spiral up. Within that spiral of leaves was a black figure. It became the  shape of a bird. Then the whirlwind began to move out of the yard and  move into the middle of the street.  First, I was little fearful. Then, I stood up from the chair and walked off  the old wooden porch into my yard and walked toward the middle of the  street. This huge whirlwind of leaves, this black bird. Then the wind  went away and all the leaves began to trickle down and this black bird  began to come down. By the time it hit the street, it was a big, black  plastic trash bag. Wow. And Truman   s call and that nonverbal  communication. And his call over the phone. So it was that messenger.  A lot of cultures have a messenger. Yuchis, we have them, too.  Specifically, a bird. So, I began to think about that. That became my  theme for my Messenger series. I don   t like to call them that. Some  people  said ,    It   s a photo of a dead bird. It   s a photo of a dead coyote.  It   s a photo of a dead buffalo skull.     This is a series about messengers. It   s taken from the old Ghost Dance,  the old Pawnee Ghost Dance songs.    The messenger says so, the  messenger says so, the messenger says so.    Anyway, there are these  things in there. It was really a  difficult  time in my life, as well. Alone.  So, it   s pain and a lot of variables in there. Denial. Denying help or  outreach from others. It   s a very selfish way to be. Anyway, somehow  that messenger came to me, helped me through that art. The images and  the work. It was titled the Messenger series     The coyote had his own narrative. It wasn   t just a decaying, dead coyote.  It was a ranch in Texas where they actually shoot coyotes, and hang  them up on trees and fence posts. So, I did these images for that and I  had them and I hadn   t really showed them anywhere. I   d been doing  them in a small way. I got a friend to help me load them up, scan them  19  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  and build them. Wisconsin printed them on a big scale, scaled them up. I  wanted them scaled so I could see them.  They were large prints on Vellum?  Yeah. Big scale on some real archival paper. They printed them a couple  ways. Truman was a curator, so he shipped them from Wisconsin  straight to New York. It was great.  You had a piece accepted by the Vienna Biennale, which is a famous  international art show, and I was wondering if that was the same year as   Edgar  Heap of Birds show in 2007?  I think Edgar   s was just what, a couple years ago? The Biennale is every  two years. I know now the National Museum of the American Indian is  embracing it.  Did they recommend your work?  Well, we kept  asking  who is going to represent America at the  Biennale. There   s only so many artists , several or a couple of artists  from each country to fill the pavilions. So it   s very prestigious and the  oldest  international exhibition . Native artists   when were we going to  be considered? So, it was a push by Bob Hazous and Nancy Mithlo. We  formed a sort of artist  organization    some writers, poets, and some  visual artists. We can raise our own money and take the initiative.  Curate our show. Go buy our own space. Go. Take ourselves instead of  waiting for the NEA  National Endowment of Arts  or the selection  committees and that whole political process that happens. So it just  formed in Santa Fe. Umbilicus, I think that was the first show we did.  But anyway, everybody pitched in some money or got some  sponsorship.  You went to Vienna?  Well, I didn   t get to go, but the group went.  My artwork went to  Vienna. LaDonna Harris sponsored my part of the costs for the show.    Each  one of us had to finance our own plane ticket  and travel  expenses  as well. It was a great challenge. The challenges of raising  money to be self-sustaining, to work that way together and try to go  instead of waiting for it. We   ve already done that  with  the Indian  hospitals, the treaties.  Legal  settlements. Someone has to take the  initiative.  A lot of your educational efforts have gone into trying to raise the  consciousness of museum curators and the public about opening up to  20  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  grassroots Indian voices. Do you feel like you are making progress  there?  I   ve been very fortunate. Some great writers, Native women writers and  men who are interested in my work. It   s like you don   t have to give them  the whole Indian 101. They   re already there. I think writers, critical  writers, know how to read the work, or can do a different take on your  work. It   s very encouraging for me.  You   ve been moving towards film acting, War Party, Lakota Woman.  You   ve been in two of Sterlin Harjo   s films, Barking Water and Four  Sheets to the Wind. What was that like that?  I   m also a liar and a horse thief. (Laughs) Film is far-reaching. Greater  audiences. I   ve had to reinvent myself. I   m not a pure painter. It   s too  late for me to be a C.E.O. or go back to law school. (Laughs)  You have a great presence  on film .  I   m lucky I   m surrounded by some great grandchildren and young  children who have more digital technology savvy than I do, so they  come to my aid. It   s evolving and changing. It is another way of  working, another way of seeing. I like the oral as well. The oral  storytelling. That could be a poet, storytelling, playwright, stage. I heard  some great story tellers, storytelling, in the home. Most of the time I  didn   t pay attention. (Laughs) Even the moral ones. Of course, Indians  are some of the greatest story tellers around. Indians love stories. They  are great story tellers. My days in the bar   some great story telling.  (Laughs) The liar   s club meets every Saturday afternoon. We   d play and  we   d close at midnight. Closing time. Last liar standing. Some great  storytelling, man. (Laughs) God. Old veterans, World War II. Indians,  non-Indians it didn   t matter. I liked that. And of course, a large part of  my life has been the nonverbal communication. The visual arts.  That   s a very important part of film acting. Did you contribute some  lines or action to Barking Water?  Yeah, I want to add my credit line. (Laughs) No, Sterlin was great to  work with. Worked with him on Four Sheets to the Wind. My sister   Indian way  Casey Camp was in theater and had worked with Sterlin on  a short piece called Goodnight Irene. Anyway, he told me   I didn   t  know this until after the fact   he sort of had us in mind for this project.  It turned out it was Barking Water. When I first worked with him was  Four Sheets to the Wind and it was in a studio in Tulsa. It was this  narrative voice in the Mvskoke language. And it   s a language totally  opposite from the Yuchi language.  21  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  (Laughs) And you did a great job.  A short couple of hours in a studio in Tulsa turned out to be an all-nighter.  (Laugh) Went through a couple of engineers who stayed with  us. 5:30 the next morning, I think, we left the studio. In fact, the studio  technician at the board who stayed with us was probably speaking better  Mvskoke than me. (Laughter) He was correcting me. But it was great to  work with Sterlin because he realized the importance of the language. I  live here, man. I got to live here, man. We got to get this right. He knew  the importance of the language because he grew up with it in his  grandmothers.  It was great way to work. Just sound it out and not memorize it. I hung  around some   I heard Creek when I was child and I remember sort of  the nuances of it. Then working with him on Barking Water, he sat down  with Casey and me and told us this is how he felt the scene, how he saw  it, how he wrote it, these characters, this scene. But also, it was very  open. He asked us,    How do you see it? How would you do it?    So we  did it off his page, his script. And he gave us an option to improve, was  open to our suggestions. There were some scenes, Casey and I both  agreed we probably wouldn   t say anything in our anger. More contained.  We   d internalize our anger. It was too easy or obvious to physically do  it. The internalizing of it is simmering. The real pain, anger is   phew   He was open to that. It was a great way to work with him as a director  and at the same time, gain a trust.  I   ve always liked your titles, the way you play on words, irony or humor.  How important is it for you to find the right title for a painting or  photograph?  Well, visually, idealistically, the work should stand on its own. It  wouldn   t necessarily have to have a title. There   s no rules, though, that  I   ve broken. (Laughs) I like to play on words. I like titles but I also  believe in strong visual work that can stand on its own. Then sometimes  you have to consider,    Well, maybe I am reading too much into the  title.    The title can take them away from the visual language. It can be  misleading or the viewer needs to bring it. I   ve added titles and text in  the work intentionally. That   s part of the work for me. I   m not really  bound by that. It depends on the work, you know. I love the play, the  word play to begin with. In my Yuchi language, I   m not speaking it  enough. It is a language I don   t speak enough. And for English, I   m not  totally Oklahoma vernacular. (Laughs) I got in this great   not a great  debate   with this woman. I had this title on a painting called Rain  Crow. Well, she translated it. She was researching.  She said,     It   s not a  rain crow, it   s a thrush or it   s from this certain bird family. It   s not a  22  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  crow at all.    I said,    I know. Does it look like a crow?    (Laughs)     But   your title     What   s the study of birds? What is that called?  Ornithology.  That   s a big one in Norman. (Laughs) George Sutton  Avian Research  Center . Bird study. She sent me all the Latin pronunciations. The whole  background of this. I said,    It   s Oklahoma vernacular. It   s how I heard it  as a child.    I heard the sound first. Then I heard people  say ,    Rain  crow    or    evening crow.    Rain Crow. It wasn   t a caw-caw. See, there   s  a title that challenged this person. It   s vernacular. That   s all I was after.  That didn   t sit too well with that person. (Laughs)  I wanted to ask you about your signature, Tso Yo Ha, which means  Yuchi in the Yuchi language. Is that kind of a statement as well?  Yes.  Sound of a train.  (Laughs) Oh I forgot. This is the time for my  Hank Williams song. (Singing)    And when the Lord made me, he made  a rambling man.    (Laughs)  So  your signature    s basically saying, my name is the same as my tribe,  not an  individual  Indian name. Is that a statement about maybe taking  the ego out of being an artist? What were your thoughts?  That   s a very good take. I think it   s a very ego-based endeavor, being an  artist. Such individualism. It   s my idea, it   s my painting, it   s my process.  Then the counter balance of that, is co-op, the ceremonial. The well-being  of the community or tribe or family, larger families, it   s always  been communal. You put that in. Collaboration today, in America, it   s  very hard, it   s so individualistic. But in some cultures, Indigenous  cultures for sure, it   s been a part of the survival. Yeah, I think I was  consciously considering that.  But Tso Yo Ha, I was thinking of that a few days ago. We have this  word, it   s a concept or it   s a prayer, Gohantone, our reference to Creator  or God or Maker. But literally, in English, Gohane is breath. Life   s  Breath. That   s what it really is. Even without religion or overly religious  overtones, a reference to Gohantone  is  life   s breath. I think about how  I heard my grandmother and some of the old people talking. They would  make these great, reverent prayers for us when we were children.  Without going to church. In a small room. Bed. I was thinking of that  whole thing and the strange thing of juxtaposing or translating English  into making some sense in some Indian concept. Or back the other way.  But then,  me , the Tso Ya Ha   they can call you different names, give  you different names. Nicknames, funny names. Busted Shoes, Goes  Barefooted All Summer, Never Wears Socks. Overalls. Give you funny,  23  Little Thunder  Whitman  different names. Or it can be very prominent, proud names, too. It   s  either way. The nicknames, you know. It was Black Swallow or Likes  Grape Dumplings, Hangs on the Apron. (Laughter) I tried to identify the  Sun Man, Tso Yah, Tso Ya Ha, it   s the Sun Being. So that   s matrilineal,  a woman   s view. The sun was literally menstruating. The blood,  offspring of the sun. The language is different than the English way  of  translating it . Blood of the Sun, Children of the Sun, Yuchi. Yuchi is, I  think, Creek for some other reference, as you know. We got stuck with  Yuchi like Creek is    Muscogee.    Everyone has some other name for  themselves. But I was thinking of that. So Yah Ha is Sun, Sun Boy. Not  like Sonny Boy. Sun Boy. Then you get older and they give you another  name. It could be like Busted Shoes. (Laughter)  Yuchis are still pushing for federal recognition. The work you   ve done in  terms of representation has been really important for that.  Yeah. Once we were in a conference in Atlanta, somewhere in Atlanta,  Georgia. Yuchis make these pilgrimages   used to in the    50s-   60s. My  mother and grandma told me in    55, they went down to the Mounds, the  Mound Culture. And I used to go down with Addie George in the     70s,   80s. We were down once in the    70s at this conference with  archeologists and anthropologists. Big conference. There was a  professor or some professional historian giving this lecture on who were  the Yuchi. (Laughter) There we were in the lobby  There was Jim  Skeeter, and Addie George,  the  Wildcats, and the language being  spoken right there in the lobby, among them, walking through  And  there was this paper being delivered in the past tense. Obviously, it takes  a real reversal of that. And we have to do it. So I did a painting from  that, with  the     Who are    question. I answer your question,    Who were  the Yuchi    with a question,    Who are the Yuchi?     I remember that. I was saying that we   ve long sought this recognition,  but we have the Green Corn and these ceremonies and that is how we  keep being who we are. I remember some of the old men now that  I  sat  under the arbor with, they   re gone. Because I always wanted to  videotape and do documents.  They said,     No, you don   t have time for  that. You participate. That   s how you keep it going.    You have to  participate to keep it alive and ongoing. You   re part of it. Your time of  being responsible, your contribution is participating in whatever  capacity. With or without the recognition. We say  speaking Yuchi ,    Of  course we are these people. Always have been.    And the question you  ask,    Who are these Yuchi?    (Laughs) Of course we are these people.  Of course, that   s why I always ask myself.  It   s  part of my personal  mythology and tribal mythology. What   s there to know and what   s there  to explain or share? Visually, through theater, politically, legislation.  24  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  There   s all kinds of ways of working. I think, sometimes you feel like,  wow, you   re not doing enough or you   re not seeing the results. I   m a  non-practicing Buddhist, so    (Laughs) It   s Life   s Breath  when  I think  about it. Buddhist philosophy, this Yuchi thing, Life   s Breath. You   re  running on life   s breath. I   m interested in yoga, the Buddhists. They  have this thing  about  breathing. Consciously being in the moment. It   s  fleeting. Like this interview   s behind this moment and it   s to be  treasured. Somehow you can capture that. I saw the Dalai Lama wink  once. (Laughs)  Okay, we   re ready if you   d like to talk about your painting.  That painting must be  from     77 or    78. It came back to me, five or six  years ago. A couple out of Tulsa sent me this image, e-mail, and asked  me if I was the artist. I told them I was, and they wanted to know if I  wanted to buy it back. They were downsizing their home and moving  and traveling. So I asked them what price they paid for it, and I couldn   t  afford that. It   s not what I sold it for. But they made it available to me,  so it returned to me. 1978, I think this painting is from. And one   s the  Early Messenger, I guess. The hawk, the eagle, the red sun, and it   s  stretched on willow. It   s a real heavy texture, with feathers and texture.  Leather, canvas, texture, real layered, heavy. So, it   s part of my texture  narrative; how I found myself.  This is a very well-known photograph of yours.  It became the photolithograph, the new Indian artists for Santa Fe. The  image is from Santa Fe 1969, IAIA campus. Even today, I   m still friends  with all the people in the group shot. The person on the end is the only  person in the group who is deceased, Terry Williams, who was from  Pawnee, Oklahoma. So, the image became a tribute to him, as well. The  person next to him is Louise Harrison, Cheyenne, from Elk City. Great  bead worker. She and I rode the Greyhound bus out to Santa Fe together.  She sat at the front of the bus, and I sat at the back of the bus. We didn   t  even talk to each other. (Laughs) She was so shy. Got to Albuquerque  and we transferred buses and never said a word to each other. Typical  Indians. (Laughs) Fifty years later, I said,    I love you.    (Laughs) Venita  Tavenpot, Fort Duchene, Utah. Ute. I saw her at IAIA alumni  reunion   and Indian Market, two years ago, I think. It was good to see her in  person again. Then myself. Anna May One Star from Rosebud, South  Dakota, Sidney Eare from Fort Thompson, South Dakota. Crow Creek  Reservation. We were all fellow students and this particular day we had  gone to put on a little performance with our regalia. (Laughs) Hence the  title. Of course, this is a reversal of the negative. I was interested in the  solariz ed  feel. Look at them, Looking at Us, Looking Back at Them.  I   ve always thought about that  title .    Perhaps I might be interested in  25  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Little Thunder  your culture as well     Looking back and being looked at and looking  back, so it   s part of the positive and negative. I wanted to leave the gray  tone scale there.  Let   s talk about this piece.  This is titled Mixed Blessings. I think I titled this. It   s an experimental  piece. I became interested in the pixelization on it. Pixelization  breakdown, if you will. It began as a pure image, I should say. Black-and-  white color film, Kodak film. Then, once we got it in Photoshop, I  began to play with it. Some of it was accidental. I just was open to it. It  wasn   t intentional. So, it   s mixed media. I   ve added some photo-based  paints to it. That  would  be another element. I   ve had a long fascination,  interest in buffalo skulls. I collect them. So I was actually shooting  the   buffalo skull in shadows. It   s a mounted, time photo  shot      Of yourself holding the skull.  Of course, I   m never in the photos  (Laughs) Once again, personal  mythology, developing one   s own personal mythology. It   s like people  having their own favorite part in the sky. (Laughs) Their favorite star.  We   re going to look at one more piece here.  This one   s kind of juxtapositioning some early black-and-white negative  film images. Actually, I shot these images in L.A. down on Hollywood  and Sunset Boulevards. It was a big billboard campaign when the new  movies come out. That particular year I was taking these pictures,  Dances With Wolves had come out.  I became interested in shooting the billboards. There was this icon,  Marlboro Cowboy. (Laughs) Then down the street a few blocks was this  Hollywood    Cherokee Building.    So I juxtaposed. It   s painted  with  photo oils . Not a pure photograph, not a pure painting. It   s part of a  series I did called The Absence of Our Presence, The Presence of our  Absence. A body of work with public images, public information, public  icons that have references to Native Americans. The cowboy   s now  become the symbol for the West.  I   m going to print it. This may become a print but I still have to  compress it one more time. It   s jessoed on the back and jessoed on the  front, so it   s got to be run through the press now. I have to seal it to a  Masonite board. Then it will be done.  Would you like to talk about this photo?  26  Whitman  Little Thunder  Whitman  Walter Straight, Arapaho, was one of my beloved friends, one of my  first elders I met on the streets and befriended. We became friends and I  invited him to my home. And he participated with me, made himself  available for a number of photos. This one, of course, was Man   s Best  Friend. He was walking and he had this pup, young pup dog. Mostly I  was after his humanity, and he offered that, reflected that. I called  the  series  Street Chief    Number One, Number Two.    78,    79, 80s   I  documented him over the years. Invited him to my home to eat,  introduced him to my children. Very important person that came into my  life.  That   s a wonderful piece of work. Richard, thank you so much for your  time today. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me.  I think  the interview  worked out better here  at the studio . Except for  the train possibly  (Laughs)  -------  -------
