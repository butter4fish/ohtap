 Little Thunder  Jacob  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is October 3, 2013, and  I   m in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, at Murv Jacob   s studio in downtown  Tahlequah. Murv, you   re not only a fine artist, but you   ve illustrated  numerous books, many written by your wife, Debbie Duvall, and they   ve  won several awards in the publishing business. Your poetic style often  depicts various animal personalities in lush woodland environments,  many inspired by Cherokee tales, traditional tales. You   re also one of  those rare artists who has been able to run their own gallery for almost  thirty years. Now you   ve added a second one in Tulsa. Thank you for  taking the time to speak with me today. Where were you born and where  did you grow up?  I was born in a little suburb of Cincinnati called Glendale, Ohio. When I  was born there, I was born in a little shotgun house. They   ve bulldozed  all that stuff out of there. It   s big ol    fancy houses now. I was raised,  however, east of Topeka, between Topeka and Lawrence, Kansas, and  spent my childhood in this kind of rural environment. My dad had a tree  nursery, taught me the Latin name to every tree. While the other kids  were coming home after school to watch TV, I was coming home to  work and dig trees and move them around and learn how to drive trucks  and tractor. I was an agriculturist as a child.  I actually grew up in a neighborhood full of Menninger psychiatrists.  These were like the top psychiatrists on this little planet. Aldous Huxley  used to come visit Bernard Hall every year. It was an interesting  neighborhood, to say the least. We were kind of in charge of doing their  landscaping and stuff, but they treated us   they were egalitarians. They  were so far on the upper crust that they treated us as equals, you know,  which is unusual on this planet. In fact, I remember Dr. Hall   s secretary  typed me up a bibliography back way before Google with all of Aldous  Huxley   s books on it, which I later read all of his books, which I have  first editions of in the back of the studio at this point because Aldous  5  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Huxley was as important as John F. Kennedy wasn   t. Anyway, that   s  where I grew up.  Then I later lived in San Francisco for two or three years. I moved out  there about the time that the Haight-Ashbury was becoming a center for  poets and artists and musicians. I lived in Texas for a couple of years  where my daughter Jana was born. I lived on the Coast for a while. Then  I moved way up in the desert where I met a lot of Mexican people. Then  I lived up in New York state for a couple of years up in Westchester  County above the city, and it was a writers    and artists    and actors     community. For the last twenty-five years, I   ve lived here in Tahlequah,  Oklahoma, with Debbie Duvall. I   m sitting here looking at the  microphone, talking to it, which is crazy. I   m going to try to look at the  camera, but don   t take that out because I think that   s an important part of  human nature, that when we   re talking we want to talk to a microphone.  (Laughter)  So did you have any   you had brothers and sisters, I guess.  Oh, yeah, but I   d rather, I think, talk about my dad. My dad was, he was  Kentucky Cherokee and Alabama Creek. His mother was put into an  Indian boarding school up in Kentucky as a child, where she escaped.  He only went to the fifth grade because his father was arrested for  running some moonshine up into Ohio from Kentucky, and the jail  burned up while he was in there on a thirty-day sentence or something.  My dad was the oldest of five children and had to go to work to support  the family. He went to work for a guy that had a tree nursery, and that   s  why later on he had a tree nursery and I got to work for him. It was  great.  My father was just about the most environmental, the softest-spoken,  probably killed as many people in World War II as anybody that was  fighting in that conflict but didn   t start out that way. I mean, he just got  pushed into a corner and started fighting back. I had a brother who died  when he was about two years old, so my young childhood, a lot of it I  didn   t get to spend with my mom because she was at the hospital with  my little brother, Johnny. I remember this just in bits and pieces because  I was, like, three-and-a-half to five years old or something. I remember  these big, friendly, outrageous country girls that took care of me because  my mom was off at the hospital, kind of like bad nannies, you know. It  was a great part of my childhood. I still remember it well, but I can   t talk  about it.  What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Dreams, and, well, my grandmother had family reunions every year. She  6  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  had them at the old mounds up in Ohio. We would go to Fort Ancient,  we would go to Twin Mounds, we would go to the Serpent Mound.  Every couple of years we   d have a family reunion up there at a different  one of the mounds. That was the art I remember were those mounds.  Then, of course, they would have little adjacent adjunct museums that  had pieces that the people carved and stuff like that.  Then I got really enthralled by this crazy Wichita artist called Blackbear  Bosin who was on, I think, the cover of National Geographic magazine  with one of his paintings of a Kansas prairie fire that he did, and later  got to know the guy real well. He was this barrel-chested, friendly guy  who would give you a bear hug and make you feel like you   d known  him all his life. Especially after I got to know him, we just got to be  great friends.  How old were you when you met him?  I don   t know. It was, like, in my late twenties, early thirties. I was living  in Lawrence for a long time, and Haskell  Indian Nations University   was right there. Dick West was right there. I had a little art gallery of my  own. I was precocious. I had an art gallery and showed Kansas modern  art which is kind of folky, Thomas Hart Benton stuff to me, along with  New York modern art. I was hooked up with some lady that had a  gallery in Kansas City, and she was allowing me to show prints by   Robert  Rauschenberg and all the New York artists. I would, like, put  these things juxtaposed, these Kansas paintings juxtaposed with these  latest New York creations that were basically like anti-art to me. I   ve  always considered the landscape the basis of art, kind of like Van Gogh  did.  Right.  I always was much more impressed by Cezanne than I was by Jackson  Pollock. I saw what Pollock was doing, and I thought it was like  spectacular twentieth-century space cave painting, just going wild.  That   s all good.  So you did know your grandma, though, pretty well, spent some time  with her.  My great-grandmother taught me to paint from the time I was eight  years old with oils.  This was on your dad   s side?  She was on my mother   s side. She was a Brooks. She was a Hempstreet.  7  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  She was an artist all her life back when women artists didn   t get any  recognition at all and was doing some damn good paintings. As I look  back on them, I was pretty impressed. Until Frida Kahlo, there weren   t  any women artists of any magnitude because the male-dominated  European art establishment wouldn   t allow such a thing.  So your great-grandma actually     She started teaching me to paint with oils     How old were you?     when I was eight years old.  When you were eight.  It was a mess, I   m sure, for her. I remember her rooms were always full  of fresh-cut flowers. She lived at my grandfather   s house and had kind  of a suite of rooms on the second floor. I suppose she probably was the  one that bought the house for him. She lived up there, and the place  always smelled of oil paints, and linseed oil, and copal oil, and fresh-cut  flowers. She liked painting big wads of flowers the same way Vincent  did.  Now, is this your earliest memory of doing art, is painting with your  great-grandma?  Oh, no, I remember when I was a little tiny kid, trying to scrounge  pieces of paper from people so I could do drawings and stuff. People  were always giving my parents paper, so I would have paper to do these  piles of drawings that I used to do even when I was   I think I was  drawing as soon as I learned to pick up a pencil.  Did you have any valuable art experiences in elementary school or  secondary school?  Yeah, I liked the high school art teacher I had. She really encouraged  me. Most of the kids were in the art class to have an easy class, and they  were a bunch of idiots, but she saw that I was serious about art, even at  that age. She really focused on me and threw me a lot of choice tidbits to  get my brain going, and showed us films about Picasso and showed us  films about Pollock and showed us films about Vincent. It was all good.  Usually, it was hard to watch the films because other people were  throwing things at each other. I was fairly large, so they didn   t really  throw stuff at me.  8  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  But you took it seriously?  Yeah, yeah, art     Did you sell any work when you were in high school?  I don   t know. Probably gave it away to girls I liked. By high school, I  already had a couple of girls that were my models, and I did, like, nude  drawings of them. A few years ago, my mom showed me these drawings  that I did in high school, and they weren   t too bad. I was having to kind  of clandestinely bring girls around and draw them nude because my  parents were fairly religious and that was kind of   but they never held it  against me that I was an artist or that I liked artists and wild people.  They always saw it as quite interesting. (Laughs)  Now, you mentioned you ended up   you went to college, I guess, in     Yeah, when I was seventeen I abandoned high school, which was a lost  cause. Went up there and passed the entrance exam and went to college  for about a half a semester, and realized college was extended high  school. At that point, it began to dawn on me that none of the great  artists had actually gone to college, though college was more and more  appropriating these guys. They were taking the stuff that they had done  and wearing around their clothes, so they weren   t really wearing any  clothes at all.  College began to look more to me like ROTC training and how to build  nuclear devices. It was just not something I wanted to be associated with  at all. In fact, I guess I sort of dropped out of college completely after I  spent two years living in San Francisco and up in Marin County, and  hanging around with everybody from Jimi Hendrix   I probably hung  out with Janis Joplin a hundred times, but we were both twenty-year-old  kids. Jerry Garcia was an older guy. He was, like, twenty-two or twenty-three,  you know, but we still hit it off really well.  Were you playing an instrument? Were you active in the music scene?  Not at all. In fact, I did posters in those days which are still floating  around. I was part of that art scene that did those fabulously overblown  and overemphasized posters for people like Michael McClure, the poet.  McClure was, like, the youngest of the beat nik  poets but really wasn   t  like that. He was from Kansas, but he moved out there.  Allen  Ginsburg  and those people loved him and took him under their wing. He began  writing his beats poems and his crazy plays like The Beard. I did one of  the posters for his play The Beard, which was never ever put on without  getting busted at the end when Billy the Kid has oral sex with Jean  9  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Harlow. That, hence, was    the beard    because neither of them had  beards. I got it. I got what he was talking about. I understood these  beatniks.  I actually think I saved Ginsburg   s life one night from a bunch of gypsy  joker motorcycle guys. I   ve never liked bikers. If you   re a biker  watching this, I don   t like you. You   re a Nazi. You were wearing  swastikas in those days. I   ve always been leaning toward   I always  liked Fidel Castro better than John Kennedy. I   m sorry, but he was like a  huge millionaire guy, and Castro was creating a place where people  could live.  You know, if I   m Native art, it has to do with something bigger than one  tribe. It has to do with the Americas being appropriated and the Mayans  and the Aztecs turned into an agricultural work force, the hacienda  system. I   m a partisan. I don   t like the Koch brothers. Who I am is  unimportant, though, but my artwork that I do   Julie  Little Thunder   will tell you that I stopped what I was doing to do this interview because  I try to paint every day. I   ve had some health problems. I   m sixty-eight,  but I still think it   s important for an artist not just to brag about being an  artist but to actually paint every day.  Murv, did you get a chance   Native activism was happening around the    60s, too. Did you see any of that scene at that point?  I was about this close to the whole Alcatraz scene, but I had already  moved up to Marin County and then moved back to Kansas when  Alcatraz got going. Yeah, I   ve always totally admired Native activism,  but what I see is a problem with Native American activists thinking that  Mexican Indians aren   t Native Americans and Bolivian Indians aren   t  Native Americans and the people crossing the border somehow aren   t  Native Americans when all of them are. They   re the disjointed  agricultural people that came up here to take care of the crops. I   ve  always had the greatest respect for these people. I lived down on the  Texas-Mexican border for a year.  Now, how old were you when you were living down there?  Probably thirty, and I was painting. I was living across the street from  another guy who was a painter, and it was back in the days when  Cormac McCarthy showed up in that neighborhood and started writing.  He showed up from, like, Pennsylvania, and the distance and the sky and  the people and everything just blew his mind. Cormac McCarthy  becomes this totally different person after a couple of years down in that  border country. I was living in No Country for Old Men in the time he  was talking about. I was seeing the agriculturalism become the drug  10  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  trade because it was so much more lucrative and the government  couldn   t boss them around.  So you mentioned in Lawrence you had your art gallery.  Yeah, it was called Seven East Seventh Gallery. That was the address.  The guy gave me a real big break on the rent because he liked what I  was doing. He was a visionary. He could see what I was doing. Just like  this place here, the lady that owns it   s pretty rich. She charges me less  rent than most people around here charge for a decrepit, dilapidated,  disjointed mobile home. She likes me, so I have a studio on the main  street.  So I   m wondering when you just really decided, you started exploring  Native subject matter and got so     Oh, well, I am. I mean, that   s who I am. That   s where we went to our  family reunions. That   s where I first skinned up both knees and both  elbows and my face, was falling down a mound.  But you were exploring different subject matter, too, so when you really  set on this path, was it when you were in Kansas, or after meeting Bosin,  or was it happening the whole time?  Yeah, it   s not   you   re trying to make it like I went on different paths,  and it was all one totally unified path that I   ve been on ever since I was a  kid.  Right.  Ever since I started reading good novelists, I knew it was time for me to  make a dent in the crap going on, you know?  Right. So how about your color scheme? Was it what you   re using now,  or when did it kind of start to change, do you think?  I don   t think my color scheme   s changed at all. You can go back and  look at the stuff I was doing thirty years ago, and I was very basically  using the same colors. I basically like the colors of Cezanne more than  any other artist. The colors Cezanne used influenced me as a kid, and  they still do. Gauguin was the first Native American artist. He was one  quarter Inca and one quarter Spanish and half French, so he was  ostensibly the first Native American artist of any magnitude. If they   d  known he was an Inca, they probably wouldn   t have treated him with  such deference.  11  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  How did you end up moving to Oklahoma? What made you decide to  make your way down here?  I was coming down here to see a Cherokee artist/historian/culturalist  named Cecil Dick. You can look him up on Google. He   s there. He   s  probably the most important of all the Cherokee artists, though a lot of  them think they are, but he was. He understood what being Cherokee  was, and he liked me from the minute we saw each other. He was an ex-prize  fighter. He dressed like a Mexican from southern California. He  dressed like a Mexican-Indian. He wore Chinos and flannel shirts, and  he just didn   t put on any kind of airs at all. He could fight a guy if he had  to, and he could win. He was an orphan from the time he was eleven  years old, so he went through the most horrible of the Indian boarding  schools of that period, like Chilocco  Indian School  and stuff.  We hit it off from the get-go. He said    I always thought it was going to  be some full-blood that was going to come along and get what I do, but  it was you.    I said    Well, I didn   t know who was going to be my real art  teacher, but it turns out to be you.    Cecil said,    Yeah, I studied with this  guy who was a European kind of master artist, and he showed me about  colors and stuff like that.    Cecil had the notoriety of having been to  Dorothy Dunn   s Santa Fe studio and being part of the art scene at  Bacone College in Muskogee. He was the only person that went to both  of them, and he was just getting pretty damn old by the time I met him. I  would have loved to hung out with that guy when he was a young guy  out in California. That was back in the days of the zoot-suiters and stuff,  I   m sure. He was born in 1915 or something. You can look it up.  What did you get? What are the most valuable things you learned from  Cecil Dick?  To see what was Cherokee and what was sort of pseudo-Cherokee and  what wasn   t Cherokee at all. When they created AIM  American Indian  Movement , there wasn   t supposed to be a national AIM because every  Indian culture is different. Merlin  Little Thunder    s culture is different  from   . Robby McMurtry   s culture is different from   . Everybody  comes, like, from a different culture. There aren   t that many artists, and  they come together, and they act as a unified body. The people that  created AIM wanted to have local AIM organizations. They knew if they  had national organizations, outsider government informants would come  in and take up, which is what happened. Go look at it. I know those  people. I know the ones that were real, and I know the ones that were  government informants.  I   m not going to go into it, but they did that, and they   re still doing that.  Anytime anybody gets political, these people are going to go throw  12  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  something on them to put out the fire. They   re really afraid of the  Indians because they took their land. They usurped all these resources.  No amount of treaties is going to make what they did right. They took it  and then said,    Here, sign this.    Any court of law would say,    Well,  that   s not right,    but the lawyers were born-and-raised descendants of  the people that took the land here, so they don   t even get it.  So when did you first start entering competitive shows here in  Tahlequah?  I didn   t really   the first show I entered down here was at the Five   Civilized  Tribes Museum. I don   t have a tribal membership card. Some  people take that very seriously, and others don   t give a damn. Five  Tribes Museum has never cared one way or the other if I had a  membership card, even when they were under fire from David Cornsilk  and his deranged cohorts. I entered a show at the Five Tribes Museum  and won Second Place in painting and went,    This is fun.     Was it your first competitive show, sort of?  Pretty much, because I was just painting and selling paintings, so I  didn   t care about competitive shows. The whole thing seems rather  academic to me, but I like the museum, and I like the people at the  museum. At some point they made me a master artist over there. I think  it was the tyrant Chad Smith that actually pushed for my nomination,  which is kind of like having Napoleon make you governor of  somewhere, Utah. Yeah, it   s a great little museum, but then, of course,  it   s very exclusivist, and you   re saying,    Well, these are the Civilized  Tribes.    Which meant what? They had slaves? I think so. I think that   s  why they considered them civilized: because they enlisted the help of  black slaves, not the help but the forced slavery of black slaves.  Now, not all Cherokees did that. Not all Creeks did that. The MacIntosh  Creeks certainly did that. John Ross, who they just built a new museum  to out here, certainly had 150 slaves at any given time. The Keetoowahs  formed up as an anti-slavery   they were the full-blood society. Their  main thing was their opposition to slavery, and they did not see it as an  option. They fought against the Confederacy in the Civil War to great  advantage of the North. They fought well. Stand Watie, though, he had a  few slaves and was a lawyer and was able to write titles for slaves and  make up titles for slaves. He didn   t go after those people because he  determined before the Civil War that he wasn   t going to fight other  Indians. He would fight the Europeans, but he would not fight another  Indian. No matter what their belief system was, he was not going to raise  his hand against another Indian. Stand Watie was, above all else, a  Indian and one of my heroes. Even though he dabbled in slavery, he  13  Little Thunder  always seemed to keep his head about him and not get pulled down into  it like a lot of people did, a lot of people around here.  Then after the Civil War, they had the Dawes Enrollment. They lined the  people up at the Dawes headquarters, and they had guys sitting there  looking at the Indians. If they looked black, if they had the nappy hair,  or they had the stripes on their fingernails, they would mark them as    F     for Freedmen and mark out their blood quantum and take it away from  them. A lot of, like, three-quarter blood Indians that had a little trace of  black blood were marked clear off the tribe and put in the Freedmen  rolls. They still aren   t back on them because of the extent racism of the  1890s, 1900s, 1910s, 1920s. It went way on up until World War II, the  racism against black people. It still exists in the South. They still need  the  Voting  Rights Act even though they   ve stricken a bunch of   .  Anyway, yeah, I could talk about that all day. I guess it   s not important,  really, about what we   re talking about, but I think it is. I   d like to see  who the artists would be if they hadn   t done that.  I got kicked out of the Cherokee Nation art shows about ten years ago  for not having a card when they rebooted everything. I was rebooted out,  myself, which is fine. I more and more see the Cherokee Nation as a tiny  tornado in a teapot, a molehill amongst bloody Sierra Mountains, and the  people running it are a bunch of white lawyers from Tulsa that wanted to  have their own tribe and didn   t have enough blood quantum to be  Keetoowahs. I   m not sad to be   . Cecil Dick never had anything to do  with what those people were doing. He was a Keetoowah from the time  they created the band back in the 1940s, and he always wrote    Cecil  Dick, Keetoowah.    I somehow unwittingly made friends with some of  these chiefs and stuff. I actually regret it to this day. I   ve really   it   s  kind of like,    Forgive me. I know not what I do.    What the hell was I  thinking? It still exists, but it   s a joke, and it becomes more of a joke  every day.  There are people now in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma that are  1/4,000 Indian. These are not Indians. I   m sorry to be the one to point it  out, and it   s not because I   m disgruntled. It   s because I   m amused and  amazed. How can they call themselves Indians? They   ve got people on  the Tribal Council that are 1/256. They keep saying,    Blood quantum   s  not important. We   re citizens.    What crap  Of course it is  These laws  and provisions and treaties were made for Indian people to help them  adjust and be able to deal with what   s going on in their world, or were  they just put in place to pin their ears back? It   s always been a debatable  subject.  What were some galleries that were important to you as you started  entering shows and winning awards, or was gallery representation very  14  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  important?  No, it never was. I always wanted to represent myself. I always saw  galleries kind of the way Merlin does, which is they take half the money  for representing you.    Oh, thank you very much.    It   s kind of like I   m  not paying enough money to survive on this planet as it is without  galleries. That   s why I don   t have a bunch of other people at this gallery.  If I lose somebody   s painting, they   re going to be genuinely pissed off at  me. They   re going to not like where I hung it. I just want to have my  artwork and hang it where I want to. The gallery up in Tulsa   s not doing  any good. Tulsa used to be just dramatically rich, thirty, forty years ago,  but now she   s kind of like an old lady that used to be rich, pushing a  shopping cart around, like a bag lady. There are some rich people, but  they don   t really care about the arts. They   re vested. They used to care  about art, but they   re not very really interested in it.  They   re starting to treat Woody Guthrie like a native son. They hated  that guy twenty years ago. They tore his house down in Okemah. Now  they have a festival. It   s all crap. I like Tulsa, but as you know from  living there, it   s got an unbelievable murder rate. People just seem     they killed a guy because he charged them too much for getting them a  car key the other night. Then, of course, he was in on it, too. He had a  gun, and it turned into a Wild West gun fight. He was too slow, though.  These gangsters out-shot him. Craziness. I   d just as soon be over here in  the woods, but methamphetamines have taken their toll over here in the  woods, though.  How did you meet your wife, Debbie?  I was delivering some paintings to a show at the Cherokee Heritage  Center, and I took the paintings down in the   they said,    Take those  down in the basement.    I took the paintings down in the basement, and  there was Debbie Duvall. I fell in love with her right that minute. We  had a brief whirlwind courtship, and we   ve been together for twenty-five  years.  That   s great.  Yeah, she   s just   I don   t know. She   s probably got an IQ of 200. I   ve  probably got an IQ of 150, but I can put up with   she can put up with  me because she   s got an IQ of 200 and she   s used to that shit. She   s used  to people being dumber than her. (Laughter)  We   re going to talk about your collaboration here in a minute, but I was  wondering, the business part of art is sometimes the hardest to handle.  How did you approach it when you started more selling and you were  15  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  serious about selling?  Well, when it comes to business, I   m going to have quote Rhett Butler  from Gone with the Wind.  How about when you got your first illustration job?  I was real excited. I don   t get as excited now. I   ll tell you one thing that  the artists need to understand, though: the bigger the publisher, the easier  it is to work with the people. The littler the publisher, the more   they   re  so worried about this thing rising or falling. They   re not going to throw  the baby out with the bathtub like a big publisher. Big publishers don   t  really care. They   re fun to work with. You can get away with anything.  I was sending them stuff to approve, and then they   d send it back.  They   d tell me they wanted something else. I   d put something else in  there, then we   d argue about it but not very much. I hid cryptic slogans.  I   ve always been an illustrator, but a hundred years from now people are  going to look at my books and find all these hidden figures and hidden  slogans and hidden sayings. The Disney people caught up with me. The  stuff I wrote about Disney in that book got me kicked out of the Disney  stores, which is, like, the least of my worries. I had a meeting with     Is that because you had work in the Disney stores?  Well, they had my books in the Disney stores, and then they found out  that there were cryptic, underground jabs at Disney in the stuff they were  selling, which apparently has happened more than they would ever want  to admit. A lot of artists have found that quite easy to do. They   re just  such an obnoxious bunch if you meet them.  That is funny. So some early books were done with  Robert  Conley and,  I think, Gayle Ross     Yeah.     and then you started working with Debbie.  You can take this part out if you want to, but Gayle Ross just wanted to  squabble with people all the time. She liked to argue with people on the  Internet, and she just liked to make enemies. She would pick on my  friends if they came to a conference here. Then she went absolutely  ballistic at the end there, backing Chad Smith, and did some really racist  commercials they couldn   t even show on TV. They   re going after the  Freedmen,    We   re going to get the Freedmen.    (Laughs) They just  buried themselves.  16  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  People need to take a much closer look at Cherokee politics. It is a  tempest in a teapot, but it   s amusing as hell to see these people take  themselves so seriously about a little dabble of government benefits,  which is really just the government giving them back what they took  from them.  Then the casinos, you know, the casinos here in the Cherokee Nation,  they have a Cherokee Entertainment. They   re a bunch of board  members, and they hold court up there in Catoosa where the big casino  is. There   s a little   50s golf course up behind it, and up on the second  floor there   s a meeting room with a table the size of New Jersey and  tinted windows so nobody can see in. They kind of run things like a  bunch of Mafiosos from up there, and they take all the Cherokee casino  money and really, generally, spread it out amongst themselves.  Like, fourteen people get 90 percent of that money, and the other  300,000 so-called Indians get 10 percent of the money. It   s crazy. They  do it. Look it up. Go up there and look if they   ll let you. They won   t let  you in. They certainly won   t let me in. I   ve written about them, actually,  in public. They wouldn   t publish that in the Tulsa World because Tulsa  World is so far up their behinds they   re not going to say anything about  the Cherokee Nation, it   s crazy. What a planet. That   s another reason to  like Tulsa. What a planet.  When did you and Debbie start to collaborate on books?  Well, really, it was when Gayle Ross just became totally unpredictable  and indecisive, and things were unmanageable. She was coming up with  just lavishly inappropriate schemes for books that had no interest to me  at all. One day I asked Debbie,    Do you think you could   .    She started  writing me some books, and they were flawless. She   d worked under,  like, four different directors at the Cherokee Heritage Center, and she  wrote all of them   s letters. They can deny it if they want to, but  everybody knows it   s true. It was her that wrote their letters, and so  when she started writing, she never used bad grammar. She won   t cuss. I  try to get her to cuss once in a while just to tease her, and she won   t  cuss. She   s like this wild guitar player, free spirit. She   s like an angel.  You can   t get an angel to cuss even if you try.  Were there any challenges?  She was the perfect   no. In fact, au contraire. We could be doing a lot  more children   s books if we wanted to, but, you know, you just want to  do other stuff. I   ve worked on a hundred book and video projects, and  none of them were, like, best-seller huge. Some of them were pretty  17  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  well-received, though.  And won some awards.  Yeah, won some awards. I   d just as soon they went to somebody else. I  don   t need them. I never needed them. I suppose they   ve probably  taken   I   ve won the Trail of Tears Art Show out there that the  Cherokees have.  You mean Grand Award?  No, I   ve won   yeah, Grand Prize, Grand Prix. I   ve won it, but I   m sure  they   ve taken my name off of their programs by now because I don   t  have the little magic card, that even if you   re 1/4,000 that   s what makes  you a Indian. It   s all fun to me. It   s all fun and games.  So do you kind of feel like illustrating might sometimes take away time  that you would rather spend doing paintings?  Well, we   re working on a new book right now. I   m never not working  on book illustrations. In fact, the painting I   m working on right now,  actually, was a drawing I did for a book seven years ago that I always  wanted to turn it into   when I worked on those black and white  drawings for those books, I spent so long on those. They were so thought  out. They   re going to be around for a long time whether I like it or not,  and all my flaws and all their virtues are going to be visible for a long  time to come.  And that was for The Grandmother  Stories , right?  Yeah, and then The Grandmother  Stories  verged into these kind of  Cherokee wonder stories that were in color and were mostly original  stories that Debbie came up with that were along the lines of the ancient  stories. Robert Conley took one look at a couple of them and said,    This  is what shows that the culture is still alive, that you   re doing new stories  that still portray the ancient culture.    I said    Did I do that?    (Laughter)  I   ve gotten some great kudos from people. I   ve gotten some criticism  from people, but the main thing is, I   ve got this little guy inside of me  that wants to paint every day, gets up and says,    What are you going to  do today? What are you going to paint? How quick can we get rid of this  mundane   . You   ve got to go to the bank and cash a check. You   ve got  to go pay the car insurance. You   ve got to do that stuff, and then you   ve  got to go paint.     Well, I was going to ask     18  Jacob  Any day I   m not painting, I consider a day of my life that is wasted.  Though I know a lot of artists have drifted off into other callings, I   m  not so sure that most of them were serious to begin with. They hit onto a  little theme, and they just beat it into the ground. I get so many ideas for  paintings I don   t think I could ever   . I   d like to do some documentary  film stuff. I   d like you to help me with it if you want to. The story of  Spiro Mound, what happened over there was one of the most atrocious  stories in the history.  What happened first was one of the most spectacular stories of mankind,  when they were doing all the shell carvings, and it was the sacred burial  place, and people met there for their black drink ceremonies and did  engravings of the sky designs that they saw. Then these Arkansas guys  get a mining lease on the place, and go in and just dig the stuff out of  there, and throw the bones in the corner, and take all the shell work.  Outside the mound is Gilcrease, OU, Peabody Museum at Harvard, Field  Museum at Chicago. They   ve all got their reps out there, bidding on the  baskets of goodies coming out of the mound, and the one that pays the  most gets the goodies.  It   s so amazing. One of the things, the Lightner (they call it the Lightner)  fragments ended up at the Peabody Museum, OU Museum, and the  Gilcrease Museum. Pieces of it came out in three different baskets that  were purchased by three different museums. Then private collectors  were bidding for stuff that we   ve still never seen. It wasn   t bad enough  that they just raped the mound. We don   t even get to see the stuff they  took out of there, assess its importance. On a scale of one to ten, it   s a  goddamn fifty. I mean, it has more shell work than all the other  American mounds put together. The shells were brought all the way up  from the coast of Florida by these proto-Mayan people. That   s who the  Creeks are. The Creek language and the Mayan language were one  language two thousand years ago.  It   s kind of sad, but it   s good, I think, for people to get mad about what  happened and see the thing. As you can see, I really want to do this. I  don   t know if I want to do it as a documentary, though, or do it as a  Tarantino film because it really has a lot of weird drama involved,  especially when you go back to the people that built the place in the first  place when the Spaniards came through with six hundred pigs,  Coronado, and spread fifty diseases to all the people living here, and  where we   re sitting now became the ghost lands. That   s why it was so  easily inhabited here, because the people had all died off from the  diseases spread by the Spanish conquerors. This land was for the taking,  as they say.  19  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  You kind of mentioned the fact that you don   t really carry a lot of other  artists    work.  Who do I admire? Is that what you   re going to ask?  Well, I was going to ask, I can see that one reason, maybe, for your  gallery lasting so long is you can paint while you   re here. That   s an  important factor.  Yeah, it   s really a studio. It   s never been a gallery. That   s such a  misnomer out there on the sign. I   ve had a hundred people walk in and  say,    Oh, I thought this was a business        I was going to ask, is that a distraction?     and I   m going,    Well, it   s not. It   s a studio.     Is that a distraction, when people walk in?  No, I   m not distracted by people. I   m amused by people. I don   t care.  Sometimes I learn just what not to say, how not to act, what kind of  perfume not to wear. I   m quite interested in people as a species, though I  don   t think they have much of a future. I think they   ve already worn out  their options.  You know, you talked a little bit about one project that you   d be excited  to work on. Is there another one that you   re currently working on that  you   re excited about?  Oh, yeah, several. Some of them I just don   t want to go into them  because the people that I   m working on them with would get really upset  if I talked about what we were up to. Mainly I   ve talked about the things  that are my projects.  You had a health scare, a bad health scare.  Well, I got the typical disease of living too long. I got an arrhythmia. My  valves were good, my cholesterol was good, but my heart, apparently,  has two different congo players, one playing the top valves, and another  one playing the bottom valves, and not playing the same tune at the  same time at all. With a series of proper meds, I   m just having normal  experiences at this point.  And how has it impacted your art?  I don   t see that it has, but others might discern differences that have  20  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  slipped by me because I   m just me painting.  Well, let   s talk about your creative techniques and processes in a little  more detail. You work mainly in acrylic on canvas. Is that right?  Yeah, I started out painting with oils, but I had an art teacher, Mrs.  Billington, turn me on to the wonders of the new acrylic paints.  Was this the high school teacher?  Yeah, and she was right. They were fun to work with. T7hen later on  when I did some tests with oil paints and acrylics, I could see by setting  a couple of paintings outside for a year that the acrylics were going to  last a lot longer than the oils. The oils were already breaking down after  a year of the elephants, but the acrylic paints, basically I was winning  prizes with things that had sat out under a walnut tree for a year. It   s  good to test your materials because I do want stuff to last as long as it  can.  You   ve also done a number of black and white, pen and ink drawings.  Yeah, and they are pen and ink drawings. I would just really encourage  people not to use markers and crap like that because they   re not  permanent. They don   t last. If you can get some good ink and real ink  pens, you can do some drawings that will last for centuries. I   ve got a  pile of them back there.  Have you ever experimented with any three-dimensional media?  Oh, sure. You   re sitting looking at it. I   ve done mostly little sculptures.  There was a guy that I really liked as a kid who was a painter named  Thomas Hart Benton, who lived up in Kansas City and became known  as the absolute leader of the regionalism that was going on at that point.  Benton would make clay models of his figures and light them with a  clamp-on light to see how the light was going to go, and then paint that.  He made little dioramas, lit them, and then painted the dioramas, and  then put in the detail. I could see, watching him do that, the idea that you  wanted to really give your, how to give your paintings a three-dimensional  quality which I don   t always do. Sometimes I like the linear  quality you get, emulating ink strokes with your paint. I never know  what I   m going to paint until I start on that painting.  I was going to ask if sketching is important to you beforehand.  Well, yeah, like the painting I   m working on right now, I did it as an ink  21  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  drawing seven years ago. I wanted to do it as a painting then, but I had a  zillion other things I was doing. It ended up in a book, so I could look at  the book later and go,    That would make a nice painting.    I   ve got about  seven black and white books with New Mexico Press that I would  eventually like to do.  So how important are titles to your work?  Oh, just absolutely no importance at all. It   s something that   s been thrust  on me by art buyers that think every painting ought to have a title, so I  really do try to give them the honest titles I can hang on them.  I know some of your imagery is drawn from traditional Cherokee stories  and then also these re-envisionings of stories as Debbie writes them.  Yeah, and I draw a lot of my imagery right out of the woods. I love to go  study the woods. I   m more of an expressionist than an impressionist. I   ll  go out and look at the woods all day and then come back and paint some  stuff. It looks like what I was looking at, but it doesn   t, so it   s  expressionism. I   m more of an expressionist than an impressionist.  Your signature is pretty straight forward. Sometimes it takes artists a  while how to find out how they want to do that.  No, right on I wanted it to be so simple that anybody that looked at it  that read any form of English at all could just pick it up and understand  what it said. I did a, basically, the Greco-Roman alphabet from two or  three thousand years ago and tried to put it into it.  It has such a nice graphic quality. What   s your creative process?  What   s that mean? I get up, I take a shower, I brush my teeth, I take care  of whatever mundane business is staring me in the eye, and then I try to  paint all day. That   s my plan. Then some people show up, and I end up  doing something besides painting, just hanging out, talking about  politics, talking about art. Basically the conversation we   re having here  today is the conversation I   ve had every day of my life. I get the same  questions; I give the same answers. I have the same amount of fun doing  it that I always do.  What do you want your artwork   how do you want it to impact the  viewer?  I want it to be on spaceships, flying out through the galaxies in the  distant future. They could look out through space and then look at that  and compare the two and realize that I   m doing the same thing.  22  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Looking back so far, what has been one of the pivotal moments of your  art career?  Pivotal moments would include meeting Allen Ginsburg; meeting  Michael McClure, the poet; meeting Cecil Dick, the artist; meeting just  the hundreds of cool   . I met Jerry Garcia back before they changed the  name of their little band to the Grateful Dead. They were still the  Warlocks, which I always thought was a stupid name for a band. I love  the Grateful Dead. I was there the day they changed it, as a matter of  fact. That   s the pivotal moments in my life, were, like, meeting Jimi  Hendrix, meeting just   .  What was it like meeting Hendrix?  Well, it was like everybody was wanting to meet Hendrix, and it was  like we just pointed at each other and knew we were heading in the same  direction, and that we didn   t need to over-amp each other. He had  things   when Jimi Hendrix recorded Bob Dylan   s    All Along the  Watchtower    was the exact moment that world music was integrated as  we see it now. I don   t know if Eric Clapton would have done Bob  Marley songs if it hadn   t been for Jimi Hendrix doing that Bob Dylan. It  was when things came together in the world. It was a black-and-white  moment. I don   t see either of them as actually black or actually white at  all. I see them as people who integrated, pulled things together.  I   m sure that the Army intelligence people on the CIA killed Hendrix  because his message was just way too much more than they could bear.  Dylan was well ensconced and protected. He would never stay at a hotel.  He would stay with his friends. He would move around. What happened  to Marley, he went up to New York to sign some record contracts (this is  according to Marley) and he was going to be there one night, sign some  contracts, and fly back.  In the middle of the night he woke up because he was being held down  by two white guys with crew cuts, wearing suits, and a third guy came  across the hotel room and tore open a manila bag that had a plastic  envelope inside of it, and then slapped him several times as hard as he  could. As Marley gasped and took an inhaled breath, in a choreographed  motion, he threw the powder in the envelope right into his face. The  three of them walked over to the sink in the room, washed their hands,  and left. That was Marley   s description of what happened.  A year and a half later, this vegetarian, this Rastafarian suddenly had  cancers forming all over his body. When he came back to Trench Town  the next day, he said,    I believe I   ve been assassinated,    because I had  23  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  friends that were sitting there with him when he said it. He thought that  it was because he   d done the freedom concert for Zimbabwe, and he  thought they were a combo of American CIA and South African Secret  Police. That was his take on who they were, though nobody will ever  really know until we really do develop time machines.  Well, we   re going to look at your paintings here in a minute.  Good.  Is there a low point in your career so far?  No, I don   t think so. I   ve had lots of high points, though. I   m not much  for downers. I don   t drink much. I don   t take downer drugs. I don   t hang  out with people that consistently drag me into where I don   t want to go. I  just kind of avoid them. When my parents died, I was married thirty  years ago, and she died. These were the only low points, were when  people that I loved that I was really close to were pulled away from me.  There   s no getting over that. That   s permanent. Everybody has it. A lot  of people let it tear them down. I don   t know. I guess it   s torn me down  to a degree. I miss my parents, miss them every day.  Well, we   re going to look at some of your work, here. So do you want to  tell me about this painting?  Well, I think it   d be better if I was quiet for a minute, and you just  focused in on certain areas of it.  I love the three different worlds, in a way, the three different world  views.  The designs at the top are all from Spiro Mound here in Oklahoma.  Those are Spiro designs.  The clouds in the middle     Yeah, it was kind of an homage to wide-screen TVs. You flip channels  from one to another. Why would somebody want one of my paintings on  the wall when they could have a wide-screen TV that shows a billion  images? That   s kind of a question more than an answer.  Well, it   s a wonderful piece. I really like it.  Yeah, I enjoyed painting it. It took weeks and weeks.  Okay, you want to talk to us about this painting?  24  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  Yeah, this painting, I   ve done a few paintings of the Cherokee Little  People. Now, this lady represents the Queen of the Little People, and  you can kind of tell that by her regal demeanor, but I think all of the  Cherokee Little People women have that regal demeanor. I think that the  queen might be an interchangeable position. Now, the Queen of the Ants  that she   s talking to is obviously the Queen of the Ants because she   s got  the wings in case she needs to make a fast getaway, because sometimes  queens have to beat it because their colony is being destroyed. It   s part  of their survival technique.  And you signed it twice, it looks like.  I did, and I didn   t realize that until I had it framed. I   ll probably remove  one of those, but most people don   t notice that it   s signed at all, let alone  that it   s signed in opposite corners.  It   s got some wonderful colors, and I love the imagery.  I   m glad you caught that. (Laughter) I   d forgotten that. I knew I   d signed  it twice, but   .  And how about this painting?  Well, it   s one of my typical paintings, and it   s got Rabbit and Beaver in  a canoe. I put it up on Facebook, and the inimitable and famous Creek  poet Joy Harjo saw it and said    I want that     She   s going to pick it up on  the fifth of October which is just a couple of days. She already sent me a  check for it, so it   s real nice.  And she does canoeing.  Yeah. It   s real nice when you   re an artist and you sell artwork to poets  that you admire. I   d rather give it to her than sell it to most people I   ve  met. It thrilled me, and I recommend to anybody out there, they ought to  read her poetry.  All right, this is another piece.  Yeah, and the painting you   re looking at is two feet by two foot, but  when you paint them that way, they   re three feet across and three feet  high. That   s why I like doing the paintings as diamonds. What you   re  looking at there is one of my more or less typical animal dances that  incorporate most, if not all, of the pantheon of Cherokee animal  characters, from Rabbit who   s the trickster messenger to   all the  animals have a big place in the Cherokee stories. They   re a lot more  25  Little Thunder  Jacob  Little Thunder  Jacob  important than people. They always saw them as people, though. It was  about the Bear People and the Bird People.  The animal people were considered as much people, if not more people  than the people people. They would be the Bear People, the yona yunwi,  the people that are bears. Anyway, I think that   s going to be the cover of  SAIL magazine, which is  Studies in American Indian Literatures . I was  kind of glad that it wasn   t the Journal of American Indian Literature,  which would be the JAIL magazine. The girl who   s the editor of the  magazine is scraping up the money to buy the painting from me, which I  thought was pretty nice of her to do that.  That   s wonderful.  I want to see it hanging on her wall as much as she does. It   s real  important to me where the paintings end up. Probably close to a hundred  of my paintings have ended up in museums. Collectors who have bought  my paintings donated them to museum collections. I couldn   t afford to  give all those paintings to museums. I   ve used the money to feed my  family and help my friends for the last thirty years. I don   t have any  extra cash to give away paintings, but they   re going to some pretty good  people out there, good museums.  Well, thank you so much for your time today, Murv.  Yeah, hopefully some of the people before we wrap this up that have my  paintings would consider giving them to museums so they will not just  end up in some creepy little private collection. Anyway, yes, it was a  pleasure talking to you. It   s always a pleasure to see you.  -------  -------
