 Finchum  Parker  Today is December 3, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and I   m here in Muskogee,  Oklahoma, to talk with W. G. Parker about some of his experiences at  Muskogee and otherwise, some of his memories. This is for the  Muskogee African American Heritage Project. Thank you for having me  today. Let   s start by having you tell us where you were born and a little  bit about your childhood.  I was born in Wagoner County, Oklahoma, two and a quarter miles east  of Porter, Oklahoma. It was the year 1914. I don   t remember the hour.  (Laughter) So, I was born on a farm and I was very fortunate. I learned  about my nature, and that includes my environment and my heritage. I  had some very good parents, mother and father and the family. They  were devout persons. I had very good heritage and a very good  environment. What I call good heritage is I was taught well. I was taught  about salvation and I was taught about work. In my environment, I had a  working environment, worked at home. I was carried to church and I  learned to work in church, and I learned to work in the community. So, I  had a home environment and I had a church environment, and then I had  a community environment that was good.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I remember having three sisters and one brother. There were five in the  family, five children. I had two sisters and a brother that were older than  I was. I remember in the olden days, the doctor had to come two or three  miles. My baby sister was five years younger than I, and I remember  when she was born, the doctor came and stayed all night. I remember  that. The next day, why, they told me I was no longer the baby.  (Laughter) I then grew up, and my dad was a pretty good-sized farmer.  He had a hand that stayed on the farm and they called him Uncle Shep.  He was an old person, and I remember when I was four years old I was  5  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  walking around out in the lot. The other workers were saying,    Uncle  Shep, Uncle Shep.    And I said,    Uncle Shep     My dad says,    Come  here, boy.    (Laughter) He took the ham string and tore my bottom up.  He says,    The man is named Mr. Sheppard.    I call him Mr. Sheppard  today. I remember that.  In 1917, that   s when the World War I was over, I believe. At the same  time, they had what they called the flu. The flu. I was four years old, I  believe, and this man brought a horse out there. They put me up on that  horse and I rode three miles to get Mrs. Sheppard, his wife. My mother  and dad were in the bed with the flu. I guess the oldest girl was cooking.  Now you can         t get a four-years-old to carry out the trash can, but I was  farming at eight years old. I done jumped now from four to eight.  What were you farming?  At that time my dad was a wheat and grain farmer.  Not cotton?  No. Weren   t no row crops, not then. We had wheat binders. Now, the  combine wasn   t in existence. We changed locations then, from what we  called the old place to the new place, from two and a quarter miles from  Porter to a mile from Porter and a new home. We were on 160 acres  there, and my dad had bought a piece of land across the highway. It  wasn   t a highway then. That   s 51B. 51B moved from 69 into Porter, and  the railroad goes through the farm. But my dad had bought a farm over  on forty acres and it was adjoining what we called the new place. A  wealthy person lived there. It was 110 acres and a beautiful home. But at  this time, this guy sold this home to my dad. It was a modern home, built  just like this house. This house was built in 1914, when I was born. He  said he wanted him to have that land, so we continued to be big grain  farmers then, about 240 acres of grain land.  My older brother and dad would run the binder, and my mother would  put on her husband   s britches and we would shock wheat behind those  two binders. We had 100, 200 acres of grain. I was a little older than  eight then, and I was milking sixteen cows every morning and evening.  I   d get up at four o   clock. Four o    clock in the morning, milk sixteen  cows. When I became six years of age, then I walked to school. Milked  sixteen cows, then walked a mile and a quarter to school at Porter. 51B  wasn   t in existence then. We   d have to go down to the railroad. My  sisters and brothers taught me how to get off the railroad track for the  train. (Laughter) Rain, sleet, or shine, that   s when we went to school,  when the weather was bad. When the weather was good, you farmed.  Those were some wonderful experiences.  6  This is what I remember of my childhood. I learned to feed chickens.  My mother would run a couple of incubators and hatch off about a  couple dozen chickens. Had a chicken house done by wood, and we   d go  out there and eat peanuts and take care of the chickens during the cold  weather. That   s an awful experience. Feed hogs. We had hogs, horses,  mules and cows, chickens.  This might be funny. My dad had a lot of hogs and they ran out, you  know. It was funny then. Hogs would find something to eat, running out.  I was in the dairy barn. Didn   t have any milkers then. These were the  milkers  his hands . Do you know what a sow is? Sow come in there  while I was milking, this cold weather just blowing, just walking like  that  swaying back and forth , and I got scared. I went to the house and  told my dad that some hog... He said the hog was drunk, and was half a  dozen, or a dozen, shoats. Weaned pigs, you know, and they were lying  up on top of the snow, it was ice. They were drunk and they were falling  out on the way home. They traced it back to a neighbor, and he   d been  making whiskey, and the hogs turned his whiskey over and drank it up  and got drunk. (Laughter) Exposure. A little stage different from  experience is exposure.  My dad had his own thrashing machine, him and his brother. His brother  was a big farmer. Owned a thrashing machine, eighteen men working,  Mother was cooking. A couple of ladies from the neighborhood over  there were helping her. Set twelve people down at a table and fed them.  Now, this is something that happened, but it tells you about the culture  and the advancement, or the non-advancement. He had a contract with  his neighbors, had all the horses, about half a dozen bundle wagons, and  about three or four wagons that would haul grain. And at noontime,  there were eighteen in all, they come to eat. My mother told the guys to  come in and eat. They   d come in, and about four or five Caucasians,  they came in and sat down, and when the Negroes come in and sat  down, they got up and left. They didn   t want to eat with them.  So, my dad went out and told them to take their team and go home, and  they   d still be over there and fulfill the contract. But I think about what a  management factor it was. He didn   t fall out with nobody; he got along.  Today we are not able to get along. We just think that people have got to  think like we think. The philosophy or the theory is that no one character  stops the show. Or the old one that says no one monkey stops the show.  They just moved on. Still had neighbors; these were neighbors. I don   t  think they think like that today. The thinking, and this is what I see  today, America   s thinking is changing. If you watch them every day,  they   re changing. Watch them over on the TV.  It came to the place where in my farm experience, I completed the  7  Finchum  Parker  eighth grade. My sisters completed eighth grade before me, four or five  years before I did. Somewhere in the early    20s, I can   t recall the dates,  they were Baptist in their faith, and the National Baptist Convention was  holding their meeting here in Muskogee at the First Baptist Church. It  was built in 1903, but this was in the early    20s. Nana Burrows, this was  a missionary lady, had a school for girls in Washington, D.C. Mrs.  Parker  his mother , Mrs. Green, Mrs. Leroy. Mrs. Leroy had a daughter,  Mrs. Green had a daughter, Mrs. Parker had two daughters  his sisters ,  and those ladies come in on that woman over here to the National  Baptist Convention. That woman said,    Send your daughters to  Washington. I   ll take care of them.    They   re getting their daughters out  of there and they   re pretty good-looking daughters, you know. They had  an intuition; they should get them out of there or else they might be  confisticated. (Laughter) So, they got them to Washington, and they  spent three years there, off the farm. When they came back, they spent  seventh, eighth, and ninth grade in Washington. Then they went to  Langston and when they finished at Langston they turned to be teachers.  They were teaching when they finished their second year of college,  ordinarily. In high school, they taught a long time.  Catching up with me now, I finished high school. There was no high  school in Wagoner County for Negroes. People had to come to  Muskogee to Manual Training High School, so there was no high school  for me. My dad says,    I didn   t go but to fourth grade and I made it.    But  my mother was an alert person who believed in education. Got it? My  dad did, but a different kind. I don   t know whether you follow me or not.  I   m with you.  So, these sisters began to talk to me about how to act when I went to  Langston. Langston was a college-high school, high school into college.  CANN University, call it agriculture. It was a land-grant college. How to  get along with the girls and the boys in the dormitory, doing a lot of  schooling. So, they sent me to Langston in 1929. They were paying my  way; they were farming. Now my brother   s gone and I   m gone. My dad,  maybe him and the hand was handling that big operation up there,  paying my way. September, October, November, December, January,  February, and in March I went to the mailbox near two o   clock. At  Langston University, high school student, I learned how to take a shower  every day instead of Saturday night, was eating three hot meals. On the  farm, I ate what was left over at night. Ate a big breakfast; that was the  main meal. I   d been in that college and I   d gotten smooth, got that dirt  off of me. (Laughs) And the letter had a money order in there that said,     Come home. Can   t keep you. We   re about to lose the farm.    Ah, Lord,  my. A sad day, sad day. I just can   t go back there. I just can   t go back  there. What I   m going to do? No job on the campus; everybody is there  8  because they   re working, but I said,    I   ve got to find a way.     Two o   clock, I ran across nine kids, college kids, on the yard laying a  sidewalk, and I was standing up there looking at them. I   m fifteen years  of age. When I went there, I was fourteen. A guy dropped a shovel. I  went over to the boss man and helped him plant a tree. I picked up the  shovel and started to working, putting sand in that concrete mixer. That  was three o   clock. When the five o   clock whistle blew, somebody hit me  on the shoulder.    Hey, young man, where are you working?    I was shy,  from the country, supposed to be slow. I talked to that man. I told him  what happened. I just got out the letter.    They told me to come home;  I   m not working. I need work.    He said,    When can you come to work?     I said,    When I get out of school at two o   clock.    He said,    Come to  work.    I worked there until school was out and they fired eight of them,  I guess. I was the one left on there. Last one they hired, but the last one  to fire. I worked all the summer. Teachers would come in from these  rural schools all over Oklahoma. I knew them. I   d wash their cars for  twenty-five cents. I stayed in the poultry plant. I   d use the state water to  wash cars. I did.  So, I put my way through high school, and I organized in high school at  Langston University a basketball team, and I played. And that year at  college, my first year in that campus, the college team went to Arkansas.  They were the wonder team. They hadn   t been beaten in umpteen years,  and they got beat in Arkansas, and they lost a player. He got hurt. In  1931, they brought this young coach that beat them to Langston  University, and he would send the senior boys to coach these high  school boys. Well, when they left the campus to go to Tulsa, Enid,  Stillwater, Drumright, Sapulpa, he   d go with them. He got acquainted  with me, then. So, when I got to be a senior, they had what they called a  senior day, recruiting in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Muskogee. These were  the big cities. Muskogee was the third largest city in Oklahoma; now it   s  about the tenth. They had a senior day, and I asked Coach   we were  having an athletic function, track meet or something like that. He says,     I   ll get you something.    He sent me shoes and a track suit and  everything. Hot dog  I got out there with them, Tulsa and Muskogee,  and John Brown, I won a scholarship  Second place, a scholarship. Got  into college. Made the college varsity basketball team under this coach. I  was an athlete. No football. I traveled to Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, big  time. Then, I saw what other college persons were doing. I had to get out  of this shyness, slowness. There   s a lot of history behind that.    Why do  they keep picking on me?    and    I   m slow.    All that.  We were in Austin, Texas. Poor facilities then, in these colleges. High  school gyms were better than theirs, and they had poor officials. Now  they got three referees. They had one referee then. The game got rough  9  and I put a guy off on the stove, stove sitting on the corner. But they  didn   t put me out of the game; it was done legally. (Laughs) I was from  the country. Strong. Coming back, I don   t know what possessed me. I  got in the car with this coach, but he   d pick on me, you know.    Parker         Yes, sir, Coach.       Why don   t you to come out for football?       No, no.     I got too rough down there, you see. I said,    I don   t want no part of it,  Coach.    And during that freshman year   I can   t tell everything but these  events. I   m working down there. That plow was hard at that president   s  walk at the college. This is a different president. He came out of there,  an Indian guy. He was doing that  shaking his figure , I said,    Oh, Lord,  I   m in the wrong place this morning.    I had intuitions. He walked on a  ways in the street. Everybody knew me; I   m a college athlete. All the  girls, all the boys knew Parker. You hear me? All right.    Parker      President of the university knew me. Got it? I   m a freshman. He said,     I   m going to fire you.    Oh, Doctor  (Laughs) I just couldn   t understand  it. I knew I could work.  So, May come, school   s out. I go over to the administration building.  Mrs. Holmes, Mrs. Ricks were sitting in the office. He was a crazy  college man. I said,    Good morning, Mrs. Ricks.    She said,    Good  morning.    I   m supposed to get permission. I just go and knock on the  president   s door. I said,    I   m supposed to see the president this  morning.    Ignorant. (Laughs) It   s stupid. That   s a bad statement. They  didn   t bother me. He said,    Come in. Parker  I told you to go home     I  said,    Doctor, I   m going home, but I wanted to come by to tell you I   ll  be back out here in August.    He said,    But you go home now, Parker     I  said,    I   ll be back out here.    He said,    But you go home.    I said,    Okay,  Doc.    (Laughs)  I left to hitchhike home. Hadn   t been home since I   d been to college,  four or five years. Everything was the same. They were still in the  farming business; I worked there. I worked for my dad. I went back out  there in August. I got ready to go back to Langston. He said,    How you  going?    I said,    Like I come. I hitchhiked.    He gave me ten dollars. I  said,    I   m going back on the train.    Back on the train and had three or  four dollars left after I got there. It took me seven dollars to get there, I  think. I   m staying. I know all the ropes and everything. I was staying in  an old dormitory there. My trunk must   ve been left out there because it  was available to me. I   d go back up there to beat a hard line about half as  long as the building with the students lined up. For two days straight,  every time I got to the door, they   d say,    Can   t take anybody today.     They did that twice. I said,    They got something on me.    I   m a  youngster, now, how you think.  I went back home  to Langston  that day, and was laying down there in  an old vacant dormitory. Nobody knew where I was. The kids who were  10  working in the dining hall would bring me some food. All right.  (Laughs) And I says,    I   ll lay down here and tonight I   ll catch that  freight train going through Coyle two miles away, ride out through  Amarillo, Texas.    Crazy. I don   t know anybody in Amarillo, why am I  going there? But that   s what I thought, and that   s what I was going to  do  A knock come on my door,    bom, bom, bom,    in August. Now, it   s  not supposed to be known where I am. On the second knock, I got up  and opened the door. The midget who was a manager, he   d travel with  the football boys. When they went someplace, he worked for the coach,  got out and made the telephone calls and did the footwork. He said,    The  coach wants to see you out on the football field.       Gah.    That   s what I  said.    I   m being recruited.    That president   I don   t know what that  coach has together on me. I   m recruited.  When I went out on the football field, he told me to go and get dressed,  and they dressed me up. I come back out on the field. They start  practicing and I hear applauds.    What   s going on? That coach wouldn   t  do that for the president.    I got into the wheel. Missed the first game.  Next game, all that year, I substituted. My junior and senior year, I  played every game. They didn   t have the platoon system. I did  everything but All-American. Paid my way through school. I made  college life now. Walked across the stage May 27, 1937. Got that piece  of paper. President and all the teachers congratulated me and said,     We   ve done our job. You   ve got to find you another home.    Sad day.  Eight years of living good. Last two years, didn   t hit a tap of work. The  Lord has been good to me.  I hitchhiked home. Hadn   t had nothing from Friday noon, and that lasted  Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday noon, and Saturday evening.  Sunday morning, I   m in Tulsa, from Langston to Tulsa. There was a  lady there and her son bedded me down. Sunday morning, she   s cooking  steaks and they had a prayer meeting at the breakfast table. I hadn   t had  a prayer meeting at the breakfast table on Sunday since I   d left home.  But while they were praying, she had cooked five steaks and there were  four of us at the table, and I say to myself,    Lord, that fifth steak   s  mine.    (Laughs) I could eat then. I cut mine ploop, ploop, ploop, reached  over for that fifth one, and the table got quiet. (Laughs) I was hungry   Today, I don   t turn a hungry man down.  If he   s  hungry, feed him. I  made it home. Made it home.   I was a  graduate. Got home and the old man had a brand new binder  he   d just fixed up, and me and the hand got on that binder and our old  tractor. Tractors were just coming into the farm, and we harvested 800  acres of grain. I enjoyed it. I cut grain all night. We had a nice home.  This home that we bought was a modern home. Had running water by a  windmill, had gas lights, but didn   t have any shower. I built me a shower  11  Finchum  Parker  out there behind the smokehouse. I had to have a shower every day. I   d  get under that cold shower. I was used to it, but I could make it. I was an  agriculture major, and while I was in school, when I went to school the  first time, the dean of agriculture    Did you ever hear of the movie  Roots?  Yes.   The author of   Roots was a four-year-old kid at Langston and his dad  was dean of agriculture, and he asked me to come over in there and be in  agriculture. I don   t want no part of it. And my brother-in-law was, I  guess, going with my oldest sister. He was a senior and he was majoring  in agriculture. He told me, he was from the city, if he made it, with my  experience    he changed me over to agriculture my sophomore year in  college. That   s how I got back into agriculture, and it was good. Very  good. The things that I thought that were bitter against it turned to  become successful.  I went back to Langston. I   m graduated now, but I   m an agriculture  instructor, with a BS degree. And the agriculture men of the state were  having a meeting, and to be in that meeting was a possibility of getting  employed. So, I go back to Langston. The state supervisor, I   m sitting in  his office, D. C. Jones. The telephone rings. He talked with this man, the  supervisor.    Mr. Jones.       Parker.       This is the superintendent at Perry,  Oklahoma.    I said,    How come I can   t go over there?    He said,    I   ve got  three men that are already recommended, Parker.    I said,    How come I  can   t go?    He said,    I already got three men.    With that many, there   s  no use in me going over there.  Somebody caught the bus to Guthrie; we go to Guthrie and go to Perry.  Walk from the station up to the high school, stinking. School was just  out, September the ninth. Students were making it. Superintendent  comes in there. I   m standing up. He says,    Parker? W. G. Parker?        Yes.    I say,    I   m a vocational agricultural teacher, Mr. Sprayberry.     And I say,    I understand that you have a need for vocational agriculture  teacher at Blaine High School,    and I say,    I come to go to work.    He  just looked me in the eye and he says,    Sit down, Parker.    He asked me  three questions.    You smoke?    I said,    Not habitually.    I didn   t. He  said,    You drink?       Not habitually.    I didn   t. He said,    Are you a  Protestant?    I dropped my head. And I learned what communication is.  Words mean something. I caught the cue and I said,    Yes, I   m a  Baptist.    He said,    Parker, are you walking or riding?    I said,    I   m  walking, hitchhiking.    He could already tell that. He said,    Well, you   ve  got to go across the track to your people.    I said,    Okay, Mr.  Sprayberry.    He told me where to go.  12  I went down to the school and it was just out, out at this Negro high  school, and the principal knew me. I had been in contact with him in  high school.  He makes a phone call ,    This is the superintendent called,  151. Mr. Parker, yeah. I think he   s a fine fellow.    He hung up.    He says  you   re hired, Parker.    And while we were sitting there talking, the  number-one guy showed up who was recommended, and he told him  that we just hired Parker. I felt sorry for the man. Boy, he just looked  sick, just turned sick. How in the world had that happened? (Laughter)  Dime and a penny. They hired me. I   m hitchhiking there. How am I  going to get back to Langston, and how I am going to stay the night  here, and school   s going on? The principal carried me down to an old  man who was running the store there, a Negro man, and that man did me  one of the best favors I   ve ever had in my life. He sent me to the First  National Bank in Perry. Called that banker and that banker let me have  twenty-five dollars. I went back to Langston, got my suitcase, went to  my brother-in-law and sister   s house in Cushing. He carried me to the  car dealer and I got a car. You had to have a car to teach agriculture. I  drove back to Perry in the car. Twenty-five dollars a month room rent.  I   m not married then. Twenty-five dollars a month, gas bill, got to travel.  I started coaching. Coaching was recruiting ag students. The little    You  go that way,    the Negro population was very scarce at this high school.  Small. And I had to have twenty-five boys to stay with agriculture or the  State Department wouldn   t keep me. No sir. Getting those rural schools  in, I was instrumental in doing that, and got Pawnee High School and  Red Rock. Started coaching. Coached football and coached basketball.  Got basketball and in 1942, played for the state championship. Put out of  the game with one point. Final whistle blew when the basket hit that. I  lost the championship. An assistant coach and one of the teachers were  refereeing the game and they came through my dressing room, and I  heard them say,    What can a coach tell a team that played like that?     They played, boy. They played ball the whole dadgum quarter and never  turned it over. I felt proud of a team that was on the floor. They were  trained. Football, they were trained. They were trained. Working with  farmers, worked a plow beside of him, sowed with him. Go to his house  and have dinner with him, talked to his wife. I learned to see what  women had when they put the hand on the hip. She   d say,    Come on in  here, Mr. Parker.    She   s going to talk to me; I   m changing the life of her  son. She   d say,    What   s going on with that boy?     I had to leave Perry. A wonderful place, a wonderful record, but I left it.  Yes, sir. Built a new home  in Perry , new wife, new family, and moved  my wife and family in 1944 to Boynton, Oklahoma. From a brand new  house, two years, garden, chickens, to a three-room shack, outdoor  lavatory, chamber in the house at night, running water on the back  porch. It   s a wonder my wife didn   t leave me, but God was in the plan.  13  That   s right. Stayed there one year. State supervisor, Bonnie Nichols,  had been over here  in Muskogee  with the Board of Education. It had  had an uproar. They fired the principal, they fired the superintendent,  fired the band man, fired another guy. Politics. And when it came out in  the paper, I showed it to my principal in Boynton. He said,    Have you  read it?    I say,    Yes.    He said,    Let me keep it for a while.     Two days later he came back. Me and my wife was picking English peas  in the garden. I bought eighty acres of land one year in Boynton. It   s  ideal for an ag teacher, but it was something else for my family. Water  stood under the house. I had chickens, I had a cow, eggs, milk, garden,  and this man that I had who had seen that paper come back and told me  that he   d been elected principal of Manual Training High School. They  had fired the ag teacher. That   s unusual. He had something, a bad habit.  So, he said they needed an ag teacher and my wife said,    Here he is.  Here he is.    (Laughter) And they wanted to know how did I get to  Muskogee, and I said my wife hired me. They brought me to Muskogee.  I put thirty-two years here and I remember the State Department   J. B.  Perkins, all those old men are dead; they   re gone. They were high-powered  guys.  My superintendent was an ag man at Gotebo, Oklahoma. Very nice  fellow, very broad-minded guy. He   d been hired in J. B. Perkins    place  as state supervisor of vocational ag. Four-hundred-fifty men. Integration  was pretty well coming.  I   m in Stillwater on a short course in the summer, and they got thirty ag  men from all over the United States. The purpose of that committee was  to initiate a beginning of vo-tech schools. This is the beginning of the  vo-tech schools, with these thirty men. We   ve got vo-tech schools all  over Oklahoma now, and this was the beginning of it. They were  accumulating a curriculum, so I was with that group. This director of  vocational education made the welcoming speech to these thirty men,  and when he finished he says,    If you want to know more about me, talk  with W. G. Parker.    I said,    He done messed up now.    So, a day later,  the presiding person said,    Mr. Parker, give to the group your experience  with maintaining vocational agriculture in a large city.    And this was a  pilot program. It was a pilot program. Meat processing, poultry  production, broiler  chicken  production, hot bed production, canning, a  canning unit, a thousand cans a day, working for the community. Right?  I   m a young man, and the old teachers ask,    Why in the world did that  youngster get there?    They were supposed to get there; it was a top  department, white or black. Top department. He says,    Give your  experience about how you maintain the program in a city.    Just on the  spur of a moment  And, here again, I   m that shy guy. I   m not an  assertive guy. How am I going to do this? I say,    Well, fellows, I   ll tell  14  Finchum  Parker  you,    that country   s coming out. I says,    I taught Vocational Agriculture  I. I taught Vocational Agriculture II. I taught Vocational Agriculture III,  Agriculture IV, but,    I say,    Fellows, with NFA, I taught boys and I  taught men, instead of teaching agriculture.    They stood up and  applauded. Well, what did I say? Must   ve been saying something. That   s  what I never could understand: why me? Why me? You hear me?  Why you. Why not you?  Why me. I   m an ag teacher at Muskogee High School. They had an  upheaval meeting here politically, and there was a young man who was a  teacher in the school and he was very popular and very good. Was on the  radio a lot, KMUS, and the Board of Education met at his house. The  principal that brought me here, after they had that board meeting, board  election   I   ve always had a good relationship with my superiors   we  went down to the office of the high school. He called A. Kemp Barnes     this is where they   re doing the final retaliation and we talked, and this A.  Kemp Barnes told him over the phone that F. H. Harris and W. G.  Parker had to go. He  Mr. Harris  says,    Let   s turn in our resignation.    I  said,    Explain that to me.    I said,    Somebody   s got to face me because  I   ve been sending in a monthly report to the State Department. I have  nothing that I   ve done out of order.    He went to Princess Anne  University in Maryland. I stayed at Muskogee High School. Then I had a  superintendent of schools named Simmons out of Wewoka, and he   d  been here a year. I was active in the community. I had met with the  Board of Education; all the Board of Education members knew me. This  was a year after all this commotion. Everybody, businessmen,  everybody. He said,    Parker, I think we   ve got a good administrator now  as principal for the school.    I said,    You think so, Mr. Simmons?    He  said,    Yes.    I said,    What makes you think that?     So, when this man came, he looked me up, and we became very good  friends. He was an alert administrator, very good. His second year, he  said to me,    I   d like for you to be head of the student council.    Large  high school. Me? I refused. It would take my interest away from these  boys in NFA because I   m going to be competent of what I do. And I was  an organizer.  In my third year,    Parker will be over the student council.    (Laughter) In  less than thirty days, that school was organized. The principal knew  fifteen minutes after school took up what was going on. Home rooms,  presidents, organizing. The freshman class had four homerooms. We   ve  got better than 600 kids in school. Teachers are relating to students,  students relating to principals,  it   s a  different atmosphere. He grew to  be one of the outstanding principals. That   s the way it should be. Why  me?  15  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  The second year, I carried my delegation of student council, two or  three, to Oklahoma City. Three-hundred student presidents and three-hundred  teachers elected the officers and there I am, elected of over  three-hundred high school teachers. Why me? Slow. And this is what  happened to me. As a teacher, when I closed that door, I didn   t loaf and  there were no slow students. There were no slow students. They sent  them to the ag teacher slow, but when they come out and go from a D to  a B student, dadgum it. And I   ve sent as high as twelve students a year  to college on scholarships. There are no slow students. They just require  some time. No slow students. No slow students.  When you were teaching vocational agriculture, did you do anything  with county agents?  Yes   Extension?  Our office for the county was together. We used the same telephone. We  used the same facilities. He used my facilities for his demonstrations, or  classroom. I used his office. His bulletins had room, bulletins as big as  this room. That was my classroom. It was my office. It was Agriculture  Department of Muskogee County. In my room was the annual meeting  for the county agents, home demonstration agents. They had meat  processing; they shared in it smoking, cannery, demonstrations down in  the cannery department.  Were they using pressure cookers?  Yes, but in the canning unit, we had half a dozen vats. Put fifty cans or  so in a vat. A thousand cans a day. A farmer would bring their corn up  and shuck it, and they had tables for preparing. The home demonstration  agent would use the canning unit to can it. Serving the community.  Livestock shows. NFA, we had hog farms, ten acres of land out here on  Shawnee Street. We had a hog farm out there.  The school?  Yes. Don   t want to talk about that, though. I had a farm. I employed  students fixing fence. Hog farm, cattle farm, out there on Shawnee.  We   d have a shop here at the school. We   d cut out all the lumber and all  the stuff and go out there and in an hour   s time put up a hog barn.  Twelve of us or so, put up a hog barn. Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Just to talk about it, it isn   t imaginable.  Veterinarians come out of Muskogee, out of Manual Training High  16  School. Farm mechanics come out of there. We had farm help.  Awesome  Arthur Wallace. Arthur Wallace got a scholarship to  Langston. Finished, then got a scholarship to OSU. Got his PhD degree  there, then they placed him in White Plains, New York, foods  department. He retired from that and went to Wall Street. Spent three  years there then went back as president of San Francisco Business  College and is retired now in Florida. I met him at a reunion down at  Fountain Hall, old man, ten, fifteen years ago. I got there and that was  when all the Manual Training teachers were living. All of them are dead  now but three of us. I got there and I was an old man then. Seats for the  teachers were filled up and I said,    I   ll sit down with the students.    I sat  down there with three ladies in a vacant seat over there. Pretty soon, this  Arthur Wallace come sit down. We got up, went to bear-hugging. He  went back up to his room. He brought a brochure down there, and half of  that page, opened in that brochure,    W. G. Parker, Mentor.    What a life.  What a life.  Some of them, some students, D. Arthur McGruder, veterinarian in the  city of Dallas, two departments   Dr. McGruder. Harrington,  Pharmaceutical Department of Millbrooks Medical, Los Angeles,  California; Hodges, St. Louis, Missouri; James Christian   have you  heard about him? Superintendent of schools, Muskogee. On and on and  on. Electricians. The Democratic Chairman for North Carolina or South  Carolina.  President Obama   they don   t say    President Obama.    They just say     Obama.    Obama has opened the world   s eyes.    One thing, bring it to  the table, let   s talk about it.    But they   re not going to give him credit for  that.  They asked me about the jobs, and I say the next ten or fifteen years, the  greatest jobs will be out, putting the unemployed people out, producing  their own food. I still say it, and you   ll get to see it. The unemployed  people, in prison, fifteen million people unemployed, put them to  producing their own food. The government is going to have to do it;  they   re going to come to it. I bet my bottom dollar. And I   ve listened to  the Chamber of Commerce report. I read the Labor Union report. Labor  Union said,    We can put rail from western America to the east and that  will employ people,    but put people to producing their own food. Now,  food prices are high, everything   we did that during the Depression.  Everything   s rising. They   re trying to balance the budget, but if people  are out of work, they don   t pay tax, they don   t have money, and the  Chamber of Commerce says people are not spending money. That small  man doesn   t have that money. If Colin Powell says we   re in a financial  crisis, we are in a financial crisis. And if we got no money, huh-uh, you  don   t have it, you can   t spend it. They don   t have it; they   re not  17  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  working. You don   t have it.  You can   t balance the city budget. Muskogee   s trying to balance the  budget. Tulsa   s trying to balance the budget. Oklahoma City   s trying to  balance. McAlester, I see that over the TV, C-SPAN. C-SPAN is doing a  remarkable job for the world. Not TV, but C-SPAN is bringing the  secrecy out of our government. I saw the Senate. Very seldom you can  find two people who can dialogue now, but the Senate was having a  multiple dialogue. Not in Congress, but letting men talk, and I heard my  Congressman, Dr. Coburn. He doesn   t know Oklahoma. He needs to  make a survey and find out what   s happening. He   s going on his  business generalities of being a money man. This lady that   s going to  run for the Republican party  Sarah Palin , she   s out there living good  when everybody   s living bad. That won   t work  Good times. She   s  having a good time. That isn   t America. America   s being pinched now.  Okay, that   s agriculture. They took the agriculture away from the  American people, and they took the family away from the American  people. It   s detrimental. All from agriculture. All from farming. Big  farmers, commercial farmers.  My dad went from eighteen employees to two. I put the wheat in by  myself with my tractors. I worked with 1,100 acres of land and 200  animals. I   ve been there. I   ve been there, and that   s my problem here  now is got too much going on as an old person, flat on my back. It  wasn   t too much fun, but that   s what it took. You put it out, it   ll come  back. If you don   t put out nothing, nothing   s coming in. (Laughs) That   s  simple. Not putting nothing out, nothing coming in.  If you  sow, you  reap.  Were you doing the farming when you were teaching?  Yes   At the same time?  That might indict me. Yes, but I was employing students. I taught. I had  three tractors, 1,100 acres of land, 200 animals. City boys, out there  handling calves and cows. I was holding the calf and the calf scooted on  me. I thought greenback was money but    A different life. What is the  trouble with the high schools now? Kids don   t know how to work. Work  is fifty percent disability. Work is fifty percent of disability.    Mr. Parker,  what do you look for in people? What do you look for when you first see  a person?    You look for good. If you look for evil, you see evil. If you  look for good, you   ll see it. And what you see in somebody might be  what you are. Be very careful. That   s God   s business, to judge  somebody. Walking beside a farmer. Bad shape. What caused it? Why  18  am I in the shape I         m in? All I can do to you is make you think. Why are  you in the shape you   re in? Three laws of Christ   s house: love,  confession, forgiveness. Confess. Why are you like you are? Why am I  like me? Can you do better? Yes. Let   s do better. What do we got to do?  I ran up on a family in Red Rock, Oklahoma. This is one of them  masterpieces. Nine children, eleven in the family.    You girls are wearing  feed sacks for dresses. Yard is clean, the dog is poor, baby laying on the  bed.    What does this say to agriculture workers? A race or a person   who  has no vision perishes.    Mrs. Jones?       Yes, sir, Mr. Parker.        When Mr. Jones comes in, tell him to come down to see me.       He   s off  digging a grave for two dollars.    This was back in 1940. He comes in.  When he comes in the door,    How do, Mr. Jones.       Mr. Parker.       How  you doing?       Okay,    I say,    How much money do you need, right off  the reel out of the blue sky to do your farming?    1940.    Two hundred  fifty dollars.       Come on in, Mr. Jones.    I sat him down and sat him at  my table, pulled that little thing at your desk and I got a little   so many  gallons of milk per person. Got eleven in the family. Need so many  eggs, so many chickens, need so many horses, need so much land, need  so many cows. I worked that out about thirty minutes.    Mr. Jones, I   ve  got you covered here. How much will you need? How much land?        Need a team of horses, need a couple of sows, need so many hens and  some eggs. Need three cows.       You need  11,000 cash to begin with.     He   d been chewing tobacco, went to the door and spit it out.    There   s no  way. No way.    This actually happened. No way.    I   ll go along with you,  Mr. Jones, on  11,000.    That was a lot of money then.     30,000 or   40,000, but  250, I   m not going to lose your friendship. I respect you  more than that. You got a better nut up on top of your head than that.     (Laughs) I   m a crazy guy. Sometimes I   d use that, in front of machinery.     You got it all ready, boys?       Yes.       Have you examined that nut  behind the wheel?    They   d go looking for it. (Laughter) Crazy.    Okay,  Mr. Jones.    Ten days, he   s got it. Ten days isn   t bad. They were having  a celebration in Perry, Sixteenth Celebration  Cherokee Strip  Celebration, held on the Saturday nearest September 16 . I walked to  town that day, about ten-thirty or eleven o   clock, and they was coming  up from this way. I looked up there and saw them before they saw me. A  ray of life from that family. They were dressed up. Mother dressed up,  the girls and boys dressed up, and the papa carrying the baby, might  have been a year old. Joy, joy, joy. And that is the joy in life, is to help  others, but you can   t help them if you don   t have nothing. If you don   t  have love, you can   t give it. If you don   t have joy, you can   t give it. If  you don   t have peace, you can   t give it. If you don   t have gentleness,  you can   t give it. If you don   t have goodness, you can   t give it. If you  don   t have patience, faith, you can   t give it. You   re working with  people, enjoy working with people.  19  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  Finchum  Parker  Why me? And I still ask that. Why me? Why am I here today doing this?  Why, why, why? Spending time here in front of me, why? And what the  folks tell me, that work here,    You ain   t going nowhere.    (Laughs) Ain   t  going nowhere. And I   m here now.  So, you retired from Manual in seventy     1977.  When did it integrate?  1970.  So you went through that process with them.  Integrated classes. I was at Muskogee High School from    70, I believe,  to    77. Yes. The last two years, I taught girls, and coming into it, I said,     Boys, how   s old Parker going to make it?    I would use words in my  teaching to be emphatic.    Boys, how am I going to make it?       Mr.  Parker, you can make it.       Okay.    So, I got to teaching girls. They had  to be in an occupation to take agriculture, you know, jobs, occupational,  agriculture side. All right. I remember this girl. Acres, Mrs. Acres     daughter, smart kid, and she made an A-minus in her grade one day. She  took counsel with me. I said,    I didn   t make it; you made it. You don   t  let me take nothing from you. You   re going to earn it. I ain   t going to  give it to you.    I said,    You   re going to earn it.     A day or two later, I heard the mother was there with the counselor and  the teachers. Oh, gosh. I never had parents to come in like that, you  know. I heard what it was all about. She come in on me, I   m blown up. I  always met my students at the door; she   s coming in.    Mrs. Acres.        How you doing, Mr. Parker?    I knew my parents; I   d visit my parents. I  knew them.    What   s happening, Mrs. Acres?       Well       I said,    Well,  come on in here.    I said,    I   m ready for you to get onto me.    She said,     Mr. Parker,    she said,    She said the teacher said a bad word.    And said,     But you talk like that every morning. They know what you mean.     That   s something. It isn   t what you do, it   s the way you do it, isn   t it? Sit  your rusty dusty down. Do you get it? I was, ah hell, so and so and so.  When he talks like that, that means,    Get up and get going. Don   t fool  around because he ain   t going to fool with you. He   s going to dust you         You get it? They knew what I meant. Right? It was for a purpose.  That taught me something, though. You   ve got to be careful. Be careful.  I taught girls, and they were rougher than the boys. Rougher than the  boys, that   s a fact. Something else.  20  Finchum  Parker  Somebody was here that interviewed me with NFA and they made it a  part of the national program, and they sent me a brochure from the  national meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana. It   s been a while. People here,  they met you this morning. That   s a substitute, and I say,    You   re  responsible for me when you meet them. Know how to greet them and  know how to talk to them when they come in here.    And she said that  they had her as a slow student. I said,    Don   t accept it.    She lives on the  farm; she   s a farm girl. This girl here now. She   s ready for me; she  knows. But it was a culture. It isn   t that now. You don   t have farmers  now. They don   t have farmers. I made a survey of this county when I  first come in, and I told the farmers,    There   s 11,000 farmers in the  county, but in five, ten years from now, half of them will be gone.    They  challenged me. They said it can   t happen. I said,    It   s already happened,  you just haven   t moved.    They   re gone. You can count the farmers on  your hand in this county. They   ve got industrial businessmen, two  thousand acres of land and stuff like that. It   s amusing, and it   s amusing  what   s happening in America now. And it   s the result of doing away  with the small farmer and the family of the world, and it   s not only in  America. All over the world. Where   s Ireland? They have it just like  Americans. That   s where Americans come from: Ireland. North of  England, somewhere up there, northern states. Same problem. India, it   s  a larger population than America now. Graduating thousands of doctors  a year, and the doctors here are MDs. America. America. America. God  sent people, but we are straying from the mark. We are straying. Can we  change? Yes, we can change. Okay, I   m out.  Thank you for having us today.  They said don   t go to Parker, he will keep you all day.  -------  -------
