 Wilson  Batman  Today is July 18, 2009. My name is Latasha Wilson and we   re here at  the Stillwater Public Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma interviewing Ruth  Batman as part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. We   re  going to talk with Ruth today about life in the 1930s. Ruth, thank you for  joining me today.  Thank you.  Could we start out with you telling us a little bit about where you were  born, growing up, and your family?  I was born in a little oil field house in Ramona, Oklahoma   right  outside of Ramona, Oklahoma   in a heavy rain. My grandmother was  midwifing while they were waiting for the doctor. The guys had to go  pull him across the little creek, and by the time he got there, I was born.  So he took care of it then. We lived there    my mother, father, and my  brother, who is two years older   until I was about six weeks old. And  the story goes that my mother took my brother by the hand and was  carrying me and left and went to my grandmother   s and left her two  children there. And she went to Tulsa to work. My brother and I lived  with my grandmother then until I was seven.  They were very, very poor. They had a 40-acre farm so we didn   t realize  that because we were never hungry and had care. My two aunts lived  with us and they were late teenagers. My mother was 22 so my younger  two aunts lived with us. They got married and left and my mother passed  away. My mother passed away when she was 22, from tuberculosis. One  of my aunts did, also, and a small baby of my younger aunt   s. We had a  lot of that when I was really young and it was really sad.  But anyway, my brother and I, we just played and entertained ourselves.  We played marbles, made three holes in the ground and would shoot  5  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  marbles in the hole. Then, we   d make a big circle and shoot marbles to  knock them out of the circle. And he always beat me. He always got all  the marbles. (Laughs)  And the other thing that   s strange now, when we would go get the cows,  we would find wild strawberries and that   s unheard of now, but that was  a big thing in the spring. We would look for wild strawberries and pick  blackberries. In the fall, we would gather walnuts and pecans and my  grandmother grew peanuts. We grew peanuts in the garden. You   d pull  those up, turn them upside down and let them dry. Then, when they got  dry, we   d pick them off, put them in a barrel, and then we would have  peanuts in the winter. We would go outside and have these walnuts in a  big enclosed square with 2x4   s or something and we would sit out there  with a hammer and crack walnuts and eat them.  Would you make peanut butter?  My aunt made peanut butter and she also made cheese. Made cheese like  cottage cheese and then she would cook it longer and add some yellow  food coloring. It was semi-hard, it never did get hard. And it wasn   t  quite as good as boughten but we didn   t have boughten.  Did you have a lot of chores growing up at your grandparent   s house?  Chores, no. We didn   t   well, we did the dishes. We took turns washing  and drying the dishes, went to get the cows, and did whatever there was  to do. We drew water. We heated water in the big kettle outside so we  carried water for that. We did some washing of clothes on the rub board,  I   m sure. You know, just took turns. We didn   t do all of that, but some.  And what other chores? I guess that was our main chores, other than just  whatever we were told to do.  Did your grandfather sell his products in town or     We raised sugar cane and he had sorghum. He had a sorghum mill where  he cooked sorghum. The neighbors all would bring their sugar cane and  they squeezed it  and put  the juice into the big long pans and cooked it  outside and bottled it. That   s what he did, but really he was very ill and  he died later of tuberculosis and had asthma real bad. So he wasn   t ever  able to be employed.  Would he sell the sorghum in town?  He didn   t sell it, he only cooked it for other people who brought their  sorghum   who brought their sugar cane. And, of course, we raised some  so we had sorghum to use.  6  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Where did you go to school?  I went to school in Vera, Oklahoma. And the school board, I guess  because at that time it wasn   t usual, probably, for grandparents to have  their grandchildren and they were so poor so the school board allowed  my grandmother to ride the school bus to Vera. She worked in the  Government Sewing Program and allowed me to start to school when I  was five. So that was a special nice thing that was not usual to do.  So was the Government Sewing Program part of the WPA  Works  Progress Administration ?  Yes, and she was talking about that. They just made the little girls     dresses and women   s dresses with the holes here and sleeves and straight  down. No decoration, no pockets or anything. So they were very plain.  And she said,    One day I thought,    just before quitting time she said,    I  thought, well I   m going to put pockets on this little dress and just make  it nicer.    She was reprimanded for that because they were all supposed  to be the same and that took more time, more material.  Would the government sell those dresses or give them away?  I really don   t know, but I assume they gave them away.  Did you grandfather work for the WPA at all?  No, he wasn   t able to work.  When did you get your first job?  Well, let   s see. When I was in high school, I worked for my neighbor  after school an hour. She was a school teacher and I did her dishes and  straightened up and picked up an hour every day after school and from  8-12 on Saturday. And I made  2, which I gave to my brother so we  could double date. Because I couldn   t go anywhere if my brother didn   t  go. He was too much into hunting and fishing to work.  So you made  2 a week?  Yes.  Where would you go on double dates?  Well, if we were lucky, my friend would have a car and my brother and  his date would go with us to Independence, which was about ten miles,  and go to a movie and have a Coke and come home by 10 o   clock.  7  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  (Laughter) Always be home by 10 o   clock. That was only very seldom  that I got to go anywhere.  Do you remember President Roosevelt?  Oh yes. Oh yes. All my family thought he was wonderful. Since then, I  have met people who didn   t think so. But my husband was in the Marine  Corps and he had just come back from two-and-a-half years overseas  right when President Roosevelt died   about a month before he died. So  his platoon marched in the parade. I thought that was quite an honor for  him.  Yes.  He didn   t think it was an honor because it was five miles long.  (Laughter) So he complained about that.  Did your family have a radio? Do you remember listening to the fireside  chats?  Oh, yes. By then, when I was seven my grandfather was so ill that my  grandmother called my dad to see if he would take us. He and my  stepmother took us and so I was in Kansas then. They were a little better  off than my grandmother. We had a radio that was battery operated and  we had a wind charger on the roof that charged the battery when the  wind blew. And so we had to be real careful, we only listened to special  things on the radio.  Do you remember any other shows you would listen to on the radio?  Oh, we always listened to Daniel Boone, Cumberland Road. That was us  kid   s special, at 4 o   clock in the afternoon. And the Grand Ole Opry,  always had to have the Grand Ole Opry. That   s all I really remember.  Was there much dust where you grew up?  You know, when I lived with my grandmother, I don   t remember the  dust there. It was before I was seven, I don   t really remember it. But I  remember going down to watch our neighbors. They packed up their  little truck and everything to go to California. All the neighbors came to  bid them goodbye and experience that I guess. It was just so farfetched  for most of the people. Of course, I was quite young, but I do remember  that. I always wondered if they made it and if they made it back or what  happened to them.  Do you remember the government purchasing any of your cattle?  8  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  No, I don   t think we had cattle. I remember hearing about it, but we  didn   t experience that.  What did your grandparents do for entertainment?  They read by candlelight   oh, that was my chore, cleaning the  lampshades. The glass lampshades, and filling the lamp with coal oil, do  that every day because they liked to read at night. All the neighbors  would pass around the newspapers or the magazine if somebody had one  and whatever they could find to read. Because we didn   t receive any, we  didn   t take any magazines or papers, but the neighbors always saved  them for us.  Was your grandmother a good cook?  Yes, she was. She could cook. She cooked for breakfast always biscuits,  and if the chickens were laying, we had eggs or oatmeal. Then, she  cooked for dinner and then in the evening we had cornbread and milk,  always cornbread and milk for supper. So that was it.  Did she can any vegetables or meat?  I can   t remember her canning. She may have, but I just don   t remember  that. Now, we canned at my parents    house, but not there.  Did you have a cellar at your grandparents?  No.  Did they have a car?  My grandmother had a car. I think at one time, they moved here from  Texas, and at one time I think they were well off because she had a new  car. I remember this new car. And then things went downhill from there.  That seemed to be the only thing that we had.  So was Independence about as far as you would travel? Or did you ever  go visit your father earlier?  Earlier, no, we never went. He lived in Kansas and we lived in Vera,  Oklahoma. His parents lived in Ramona, but I don   t remember us seeing  him but a couple of times before we went to live with him. I was real shy  so I never really got acquainted with him. And he would just come to  visit like a couple of hours. But then when we went to live with them,  we developed a bond then. My stepmother was real sweet. She didn   t  have children so she didn   t understand sometimes, but she was good.  9  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  She did the best she knew how.  Would you wear dresses that your grandmother made?  Yes. And they were sort of on the order of the ones she made for the   I  see now that they just sort of hung and your hair was cut this way and  this way.  Did she make clothes for your brother, also?  She probably did. I don   t remember his clothes.  What would you bring to lunch at school?  I would take a biscuit with butter and sugar on it. We didn   t have jelly.  We had butter and sugar.  You would play marbles at school, were there any other games or     No, not at school, I don   t remember playing at school. I don   t remember  much about school. I remember I cried the first two or three days until  the teacher spoke with my grandmother and she said,    Don   t cry  anymore.    So I didn   t. (Laughter)  How far did you have to ride the school bus to get to Vera to school?  Probably four miles. Wasn   t too far. When I was seven, that would have  been in 1931, we went to live with my dad in Kansas. We lived on a  farm at that time and I went to a little country school, which was only  about a half mile from our house. And so I walked to school there. I was  in the third grade then so we played ball there, played softball, and just  actually ran up and down the hill and played tag and just made up  games. I think mostly tag and racing and softball in the spring. That   s  about it.  What do you remember most about the 1930s?  Well, I do remember we didn   t have real dust storms like they talk about  and the dust piling up and all that. But in Kansas we could see this big  huge cloud coming and that meant run and cover up the table or if you  have anything out, any food, cover and shut all the windows and the  doors and everything. You just didn   t do anything else, stayed in the  house until it passed. It would still sift in around the windows and the  doors and be thick on the floor. Of course, the house wasn   t too solid.  But then we   d just sweep up afterwards and shake the dust off the beds  and everything and carry on. No big deal. It was just one of those things  10  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  that happened.  What was your father   s profession?  Well, at the time I lived with him we had a farm, he farmed. We had two  big orchards and my mom   s dad, Mr. Powers, would come out and he  worked the orchards. He loved to do that, so us kids would help him. He  would have us cutting brush and stacking limbs and you know, just  helping. Then, he   d pay us a dime if we helped him all afternoon or all  day or however long, we   d make a dime. That was pretty good money.  What would you spend your dime on?  Well, you could go to town. You could have an ice cream cone or a pop  or a hamburger for a nickel. So I always had ice cream and pop. My  brother, he   d go have a hamburger. But at that time we had meat at  home and a more balanced diet and lots of fruit. We canned, we canned  like a hundred quarts of everything. We would pick wild blackberries  and there   d be a hundred quarts of blackberries and peaches and apples  and pears and green beans. We had a big garden and so we prepared a  lot of food. And things were going along. We were still kind of poor, but  we had plenty to eat and everything we needed. We were well taken care  of. Everything we needed.  Do you still can today?  I did. I live by myself now and I don   t can, but I did when I was raising  my family. We   d can   not that much. (Laughs) But we had lots of   my  folks were great on taking in someone, a child that was having a hard  time or sometimes relatives, cousins of mine that their parents would  need help. So we took two boys one year and one another. We usually  had someone living with us that they had taken in.  Do you remember any hobos coming around?  They did to my Grandma Powers    house in town. And that was always  interesting. When I   d be visiting her and they   d come to the door. She   d  always feed them and she   d say,    Well, you sit on the porch and I   ll fix  you a plate.    She had them quite often because she didn   t live too far  from the railroad track. Her husband was Grandpa Powers, he was our  mail carrier. So they had steady income, too. And he always carried  candy. If you waited at the mailbox for Mr. Powers you got a piece of  candy because he liked the company and he loved the kids and  everything. So quite often we were waiting at the mailbox and you   d see  kids standing, if you went anywhere, waiting for the mail.  11  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  What kind of candy?  Oh, just a little hard candy. That was a real treat then. Yeah, that was a  treat.  Do you remember what your father and stepmother would do for  entertainment?  We used to go to country dances that they had in people   s home on  Saturday night. Mom didn   t dance but Dad did. And us kids, usually the  younger kids, we would go in another room and we would have that  room for dancing and then they would have their room. So we did that.  Mom, she just would visit with some of the other ladies, and she didn   t  care if Dad danced all evening, whatever. (Laughter)  Did they play cards?  No, they didn   t. My dad played cards with us, but Mom didn   t play  cards. She wasn   t very well. She had mastitis in her ear and was not  well. She took that time to rest, probably.  Did you go to church growing up?  We didn   t go to church, no. My dad was not a believer in church. Later  on he was, but at that time he wasn   t. Us kids went a few times, but then  he just didn   t want us to go anymore.  What town did you go to high school in?  Well, the first year I went to high school I went to Elk Falls,  Kansas   and we lived about 15 miles from any high school and there wasn   t any  buses so several of the parents got together and paid a man, he bought a  bus, and paid him to take us to school when I was a freshman. I guess  maybe they did that two years and then when I was a junior, our house  burned and so my mom and I went to Longton,  Kansas  to stay with her  parents, the Powers, and I went to that high school. My brother and  Charles, who was the boy that was living with us at the time, drove back  and forth to school to Longton. After we got our house fixed another one  moved in and fixed, well we moved back out there.  Then, the war came along, my dad was working as a lineman at that  time. They decided to sell their farm and we moved to Elk City my  senior year so we lived there. He worked away from home most of the  time. My brother graduated the year before I did and worked with my  dad awhile then he went into service.  12  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  When I graduated from high school at 15, I went to Wichita the next  day. I had a friend living out there and she said,    Well, come on out and  you can go,    she was working at Boeing, so I went to Boeing and  applied. I just put down that I was 18 and there was a question about my  birth certificate and I said, well I didn   t have it but I would get it and  bring it in. So they let me go ahead and take the training and finally they  called and said,    We have to have your birth certificate,    I had it so I  waited. I waited until shift change and I went rushing in there and gave it  to the girl and she was ready to leave, she just took it and put it in my  file and didn   t look at it. (Laughter) So I worked from the time I was 15  until I was 19.  For Boeing?  For Boeing, mm-hmm.  And then what did you do?  Well, then I got married and went with my husband. He was in the  Marine Corps and he came back from overseas and we got married. We  went to Virginia and lived near Quantico and that was a nice experience.  People were so nice to us. Everybody   s always been nice, all my life, to  give me a hand and have just been great. People have been great.  Did you meet your husband in high school?  Well, no. He graduated the year before I moved there. But all of my  friends kept saying,    Oh, you ought to meet Keith. You ought to meet  Kieth.    And his friends said,    You ought to meet Ruth.    But anyway, we  just met, just happened I was walking to town with my brother and he  said,    Who is that? And who   s she with?    And so later that evening we  met. And that was just pretty much it, it was just pretty special.  Do you remember the first time you had electricity in your home?  Oh, yes. Not until we moved to Elk City. Because Kansas was slower.  Do you remember what year that was?  Probably    42.  So how was life in the 1930s different from today?  Well, it   s lots different. You didn   t have any distractions and you knew  what you were going to do from day to day and it was just slower and  more calm. More calm. Today there   s more things to stimulate you  13  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman     cause we didn   t have TV at that time. We had radio, but you didn   t  listen to it all the time. You visited other people or did work or was  outside. I don   t know what we did with all that time (laughs) when you  think about  it  now. We sat outside a lot and talked. And at night we  looked at the stars and all that.  Are there lessons from that time period that you still practice or that you  passed on to your children? Perhaps frugal tendencies?  Oh, yeah, I have that. But this doesn   t go over very good just being  grateful for what you have. And if you don   t really have the money or  can   t see how you can pay for it, you gotta decide that first before you  get it.  Are there any recipes from that time period that you still use or that  really miss?  There was a friend at my house last week and I had made coleslaw. And  he said,    This is so good. This is just like my mother made.    He said,     How did you know how to make this?    (Laughter) I said,    Well, my  teacher was about as old as your mother so she probably cooked the  same way and that   s probably how I know how to do it. I   ve done it for  years.     So you make some good coleslaw.  (Laughter) We thought it was good. But I do use   you do it without  even thinking about it, you do.  What advice would you give to young people today about the best way to  make it through hard times?  I   m not very good with advice because nobody listens to me. (Laughs)  I   ve given plenty of advice, but it hasn   t helped anybody. So I just think  credit cards, even though I use them fluently, I pay it every month. I  think that would be a good thing to think about is to pay it every month.  And just don   t get in debt so much.  How does the current day economic picture compare to the 1930s  experience?  Oh, my goodness. Well, I think in the 1930s you just lived for now. I  remember when we got married   this is how far off I was, my father-in-law  said,    You need to get a job so you   ll have retirement.    And some  more things like that. I thought  that  it   s a hundred years until  retirement, I don   t want to worry about that now. I look back and see  14  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  some pretty foolish things that we didn   t think about, I didn   t think about  until later and then I smartened up and started saving and whatnot. You  realize, well you have to prepare. But it would have been nice if we   d  have done that earlier, started saving earlier. So that   s probably about the  best thing.  Do you have any favorite stories from the 1930s?  My favorite stories. Maybe not a favorite story that I can think of.  Maybe not. There are lots of really fun things that   one of the things  that my brother and I used to do, there was a   well it wasn   t a creek, it  was kind of a wide gulley, probably about as wide as this table. When it  would rain, the water would just come rushing down there and then it  would go into a really big area. We would go up here and jump in and  let it wash us down and then we would grab the limbs and climb out.  Now, that scares me to death to even think about doing that  (Laughter)  Sounds fun.  It was fun. We would go back up and do it again. And it was fun. We  always had horses to ride. And that was fun. That was really fun.  Would you ride them to go to town or just for fun?  Oh no, just for fun. Just rode them around. We lived on the farm and we  just rode them around, you know.  How many horses did you have?  We just had one a piece that we could ride. And we couldn   t ride Dad   s  horse because he didn   t want us   in his words, he didn   t want us to ruin  it. Because we didn   t really   we just rode around for fun and his was a  working horse and if he needed it, put to use for the cattle. But we would  ride with our friends or friends who didn   t have horses could come and  they could ride one of ours. That was fun entertainment.  And we made a lot of ice cream when we had company.  Where would you get the ice?  Well, we would have to get the ice, you know, you   d have to plan ahead  for that.  Would you buy a large block of ice?  Yeah, a large block, uh-huh. You always had to plan ahead for that.  15  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Then, you had to make it as soon as you get home because we lived  probably ten or twelve miles from town so you always had to get  everything ready so you were ready when you got home to do it. Or if  someone was coming from town you could ask them to bring it. So that  was good.  How did you keep your milk and your cheese cool?  We had a spring. It was about what now, I guess, would be a half block  from the house. And there was a big rock out like this and we would  take our things down and set it back under here and it would stay cool.  So we used that. So that was my job too, was to transport things back  and forth to the spring, down the hill to the spring.  And if you didn   t raise cattle, did you purchase meat ever or did you eat  meat?  We had meat. Mom canned, we canned meat. We canned some meat and  we canned pork. And that was absolutely delicious. You know I don   t  really remember buying meat at the store. When Mr. Powers would  come out, a lot of times they would bring meat. They would bring  bologna, which we liked. We thought that was just wonderful, you  know, because it was so spicy and something we didn   t have. So we had  bologna. And Mom made homemade cottage cheese, which was very  good. Then, we had potatoes and all kinds of vegetables and fruit. If they  brought that, why we just had a feast.  What is the greatest invention, do you think?  Well, we didn   t have a telephone so that   some other people did at that  time. Let   s see, since then though, I don   t know. I suppose probably the  internet maybe. Do you think? I think maybe the internet has been the  greatest   one of the greatest. One of the best. There are so many.  I know. (Laughs)  There are so many. And so many advances in medicine.  Do you remember some medicines you would you use? Some things you  would create?  You know, we were never sick. Yes, I remember if you had a cold, you  had turpentine and lard on your chest with a wool rag, and that would  open up your head and that would make you never have a cold again.  (Laughter)  16  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  What about for a bee sting? Do you remember anything?  I just don   t remember ever   we were never sick, never had   I just don   t  even remember being stung. I   m sure we were, but you just didn   t say  anything about it really. We were taught you just didn   t complain.  Actually, without realizing that, that has carried over because people say  you never say anything about feeling bad or anything. I think that we  just were told, we know everybody has something they don   t feel good  over so you just don   t   and besides, nobody   s interested.  Did your grandmother continue midwifing after you were born?  The last time she did that I remember people came to get her. And she  just did it because she knew how, to help people. One night she said that  the lady was having a problem and anyway she told what she did and the  doctor said,    Well, that is what you should have done, but you could  have broken the baby   s neck and then that would have been your fault.     She said,    That is what I would have done, but if I had broken the baby   s  neck it would have...    that was a whole different deal. And she never  midwifed again because she just didn   t realize   I think she realized the  danger, but you don   t think that will happen. So she never did it  anymore after that.  And was she ever paid for her services or she just helped out?  No, she just did that because everybody helped each other, you know.  And the people who were having children were very poor. No, she never  even thought about charging. It just wasn   t thought about.  Do you have any other good memories that you would like to share with  us?  Let   s see, do I have any other memories? I have lots of good memories.  We used to go swimming in the creek. Think of that, you wouldn   t think  of doing that now. But the water was nice and clear and nobody ever got  sick from it so I guess it was okay.  Would you go fishing in the creek?  I never was much of a fisherman. Some of the rest of the family did, but  I wasn   t. We used to raise lots of chickens. I   ve dressed lots of chickens.  Oh, you asked me about when we lived on the farm, my folks would buy  a thousand White Leghorn roosters. Those were raised and we started  eating those when they were about six weeks old. You just cut them half,  in two, and so you dressed two chickens and that made four halves. So  that   s what we ate in the summer. That   s the reason they bought a  17  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  Wilson  Batman  thousand chickens was just so we   d have chicken to eat. And, of course,  we just ate chicken until it was gone and I never got tired of chicken. I  don   t think anybody ever got tired of chicken.  Would you collect the eggs?  Yes, we had eggs. That was one of my jobs, too. Dressing chickens was  one of my jobs and going to the corn field and getting corn or to the  garden.  Would you have a special feast on holidays like Thanksgiving or  Christmas?  Oh, always. Always special. My mom baked a lot. We always had  dessert. If we had beans and cornbread, we had dessert. No matter what  we had, there was dessert. Because we would butcher a hog and then  you made pie crusts out of lard. They   re very delicious and very tender,  but of course you wouldn   t use lard now. I don   t know why we were so  healthy because we ate all of those things you   re not supposed to eat.  We ate fried chicken and lard and (laughter) we   re all healthy. So maybe  we worked it off. Maybe. But that   s what we had for meat. I couldn   t  even think of that. My brother and I were talking about that not very  long ago. He said,    Do you still like chicken?    And I said,    Yes, I never  got tired of chicken.    He said,    I didn   t either.    (Laughter) You would  have thought we would have, but it was always good. Chicken   s always  good.  Is there anything else that you can think of that you would like to share?  Nothing else I can think of, nothing else that would be very interesting  to anyone. I might think of something tomorrow, but not today.  Well, I thank you very much for coming and sharing your stories with us.  Well, I   ve enjoyed doing it. I didn   t realize I could talk so much.  (Laughter)  -------  -------
