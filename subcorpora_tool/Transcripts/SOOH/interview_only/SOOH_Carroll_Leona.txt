 Finchum  Today is September 24, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I am with  Oklahoma State University Library and I am here in Bartlesville with  Leona Carroll, who will soon be 100.  I will, the 28th of October.  Not too much longer then.  (Laughs) Not much.   Her son Phillip Fitzsimmons is also here with us today.  Thank you for  having us today. Let   s get started by having you tell us a little bit about  your childhood. Where were you born?  I was born in Glenoak, Oklahoma right out here, halfway between  Bartlesville and Nowata, on a little farm. That   s where we lived for  awhile and my folks moved over east or north a little. My father herded  cattle and took care of cattle. I don   t know what you call it.  Was a farmer?  Mostly a farmer and herding cattle. Then we moved into Wann,  Oklahoma and that   s where I was raised up until I graduated from high  school, at Wann.  And what year was that?  1929. After I graduated, I went out and went to Coffeyville and  immediately I got a housekeeping job for a family up in Cherryville,  Kansas and I would ride the old Interurban back and forth.  That   s a train?  5  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  That was, well it was on tracks. It was just a little short one car. They  called it Interurban. My cousin drove it, run it from Coffeyville to  Parsons, Kansas and I think he made three or four trips a day. That   s the  way I got around.  Was it unusual for a female to travel by herself?  Well, not as much as    it was safer then. But, I don   t know, I think we  traveled alone quite a bit.  Well did you have brothers and sisters?  I had three brothers and one of them had passed on, but the two older  ones, well one was older than I was and then one was younger. And then  I had three sisters. I worked for four years in Cherryville, Kansas and  then I finally quit that job and came back and married a fellow, Phillip   s  dad, and lived at Wann, just north of Wann, until    56 and I went to  California.  What took you out there?  I just had a friend, but before I went out there, things got hard. While  Phillip was still in high school, we had a little dairy and we milked cows  and farmed and raised feed enough with what I could buy from working  at the dry cleaners in Caney. I drove back and forth and when he  graduated from high school in Wann, then it was after that that I went to  California. I drove out there by myself and it was quite an experience  because being on the farm all the time, it was really more or less  frightening, but I made it fine.  Do you remember how long it took you to get there?  No, I really don   t. I think it was about two days. Two to three days.  Through a friend I got this job at a big dry cleaners, Compton Dry  Cleaners, owned by Ralph Sundstrom. That was the man   s name and so  I worked there four years. I met a fellow out there and we was married,  named Charles Carroll.  When you were a dry cleaner, you had to be trained for it I would think.  What kind of job did you do there?  What kind of work?  Yes. What did you do at the cleaners?  I was a silk and wool presser, but I pressed any and everything. Drapes  6  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  and all kinds of clothes and I was very good on    they had so many  pleated skirts and I could pleat one of those skirts in just no time, maybe  five or six minutes. They really liked my work and I enjoyed it, but it  was all awful hot. They laughed at me; I got to where I couldn   t hardly  stand the heat, because it was so hot you know. I got me a little fan  about that big around. I think they called it a Nadine   s and it was strong.  I got permission to bring it in, so I set it down behind me and it  oscillated and it wasn   t but a few days until the girls wasn   t laughing at  me. They all had to have a fan  (Laughter) And that didn   t suit too good  with the boss, but he fixed up two big fans and that helped a whole lot to  move that steam and all of that. It was a lot of that heat; it kept stirring  until it wasn   t near as bad. But they laughed and said Leona got all of us  into trouble   It was a bigger operation than what was in Kansas?  Oh, yes. In Kansas there was three pressers and in California there was  five of us and in California, they had a laundry and dry cleaners  combined. We didn   t have anything to do with the laundry, that was  separate. But anyhow, that was combined, a big outfit. After I married,  well I never did go back or anything and I just quit thinking about it,  didn   t keep track.  So where in California?  Compton, California. I don   t know, I couldn   t tell you. We lived a block  from Knott   s Berry Farm and let   s see, it was just a few blocks from that  and where I worked. When I first started working there why I would ride  the Interurban. They had Interurbans running all over California out  there. I   d catch the Interurban and go to work. After I got acquainted I  went to drive it and it was quite an experience for me because being on  the farm and milking cows, I did farming and drove the tractor and  everything like that.  Did you have to kill chickens?  Oh, I   d ring a chicken   s neck in nothing flat. (Laughter) We raised a  garden and we   d can all the vegetables and different things that we   d  raise. That   s actually what we lived on when we was on the farm. We  had chickens and     Did you have a method for killing the chicken though? Everyone seems  to have their own way of doing it.  Well, I guess lots of people have their own way, but I just take the  chicken, like if this was his head right here, I   d take him like that and I   d  7  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  squeeze right tight and I   d ring him like that and off would come his  head. You learned a lot of different things and ways to do things.  Well did the sisters and brothers do different chores? Or did everybody  do everything?  No, that was after I was married. They went their different ways and  Nelson and my youngest brother that was alive, he worked in the oil  field   Champlain, I believe it was. Then Marvin was a driller. We lived  at one, you see, and that was a lot of oil field work there. Marvin finally  ended up with his own drilling rig and drilled wells and they lived at  Fairfax, Oklahoma. That   s where he finally had their home and worked  out of there.  So you were born in 1910?  I was born in 1910.  So in the    30s, you would have lived through the Depression. Do you  remember much about that period of time?  I don   t remember too much.  You were still in Oklahoma though?  Oh yes, we was there and I was right there on the farm after I came back  and married Phillip   s dad, Cecil Fitzsimmons. We lived there on the  farm I guess during that Depression, wasn   t it Phillip?  Well maybe right after.  We had quite a struggle, but we had chickens and they laid eggs and  we   d take a big crate, thirty dozen eggs to town and buy groceries with  them.  Town being Bartlesville?  Sometimes Bartlesville, but on the average we would go to Coffeyville,  but whichever, if we had a reason to come to Bartlesville, but it was a  small place then compared to what it is now. But we   d come down here  or go to Coffeyville; trade eggs or sell eggs and then buy big amounts of  groceries, what I mean fifty or a hundred pound sack of flour. We made  our own bread, white bread, you know. We had our flour, sugar, big  sacks, things like that. We didn   t buy just a little bit like they do now.  Did you do something with the sacks? Did you make dresses or quilts or  8  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  something from the sugar sacks and flour sacks?  Yes, we used    well the sacks that we   d get flour in, we could sew them  together, make sheets and then we made our own clothes and pieces that  we had left from making a dress or anything. They   d save them and put  them in a box and then when they wasn   t doing something, my mother  and my aunt was with us a good part of time, they   d sit down and cut out  different patterns of quilts, you know, and sew them together. They had  an old sewing machine, a treadle. It wasn   t electric, but they would sew  and make these quilt tops or comfort tops. If the men had heavy clothes  they wore out, well they would cut the good part out and save that and  when they   d get enough they would make a heavy comforter, the top,  and then they   d line it with usually some kind of material and then just  tack it, they didn   t quilt it like a quilt. They just tied it off in squares  about that big, just so big, they   d have a lining. You   d make a lining out  of something.  Would it be heavy?  That was all heavy material. The comforter was and that   s the way we  had our bedding.  How was the house heated back when you were a child?  Wood stove. And at the last, why we   d finally got to kerosene, but the  cook stove, we had usually done a good part of our cooking and canning  and things like that on the wood stove. The men would go down to the  timber and cut the wood and bring it up and split it so we could put it in  the cook stove. The old home comfort cook stoves had a reservoir on the  end and that water would get almost boiling hot. So all they had to do  was just dip in there and get some hot water. It had six lids across the  top. Those lids was about that big around. Good sized top and do their  cooking and everything on that.  Was that enough to warm the house in the winter?  They had that cook stove and then they   d have a heater in another room  and between the cook stove and the heater, that would keep the house  fairly warm. Of course in blizzards that was a little different. (Laughs)  That would use a lot of wood and go to bed and the fires would burn  down, we   d have to get up and put more wood in the stove.  Make you get dressed pretty quick in the morning, wouldn   t it?  It would. Back in those days, it was a hard life, but it was very  enjoyable. We   d have some of the biggest enjoyable moments.  9  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Like what? Give me an example.  Well, we   d get out and play. We played ball or would just run around,  maybe go down to the creek and fish and if we   d catch fish that was big  enjoyment. We   d have fish for supper. We   d have squirrels and all of us  was in school and we played basketball. We   d go different places and  play basketball. It was a lot of fun to travel around, but we didn   t have  buses at first and we   d just have to use cars and take the basketball  players in that one. We didn   t have enough girls in high school that  wanted to play basketball or knew how, so they got some out of the  grade school. My sister was an extra good player.  Did they just do the half court?  We had to play outside on the gravel and in the cold. We would have our  heavy coats on and sometimes mittens or gloves. I was fast and I played  guard, but Laura could play anywhere. Jump and shoot those baskets,  just stand and shoot them one after the other. I couldn   t, but I was fast so  I played guard. We had a lot of fun.  When Phillip was little after I was married, I raised chickens, little baby  chickens and I   d get 500, maybe, for five dollars. It was cheap. Ordered  them out of the paper. One year I had three buildings that the men had  fixed up for me; old buildings. And I sent and got 1,500  chickens .  That   s a lot of chickens.  And people that go up the hill, we lived up there. Just north of one,  below that north hill. People would start up the hill, those baby chickens  would get up about like that and they was all white. And I   d turn them  out and that side of that hill was just white with baby chickens. I let  them get about two or two and a half, three pounds and then we   d take  them to Caney and sell them   fryers, you know, and that helped a whole  lot. Men had raised corn and they   d grind it and that was my baby chick  feed. Just right up at first I had to buy baby chick feed, but then as soon  as they went to growing, well then we had our own feed, so what we  made then was something to be happy over.  How long would it take to get them up to two pounds?  Oh, about two to three months. It depended on the kind of chickens.   Some chickens were  slow but the bigger type, Rhode Island Reds or  something like that or those big white chickens, it wouldn   t take quite so  long.  Did the county agent or the home demonstration agent come to show  10  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  you things?  We didn   t have anything like that. I mean, they never needed to come  bother. After Phillip grew up (I have all these grand babies now) he had  five little kids. I was in California a lot of the time, but we   d come back  at least once a year and visit with them and then I moved back here after  my husband    well we moved from California back to Ardmore and  then on back. I moved up here after Charles passed on in Ardmore.  What took you to Ardmore?  Well, his folks lived there. He was born and raised there at Ardmore.  So you met an Oklahoman in California   Yes, and he teased me like everything. He said you went to California to  get away from the Okies and ended up marrying one  All our  grandbabies, they   ve grown up, so many of them. Now we   ve got     Great-grandbabies  Well did you have Phillip at home?  No, his father was an asthmatic. After we had been married quite a while  he started with the asthma. We went to Tucson, Arizona; the doctor sent  us out there. That   s where he was born, in Tucson, Arizona in the  hospital. Because I had lost my first baby there at home doctors said for  me to go into the hospital, so that   s why I have got him.  He   s not a true Okie then, if he wasn   t born here  (Laughter) I   m just  teasing. How long did you stay in Arizona?  He was born in April and we came back in May.  Didn   t like it?  They told his dad if he   d go out there maybe it would help him, getting  dry air, but it didn   t seem to help too much so we came back to the farm  and stayed there on the farm. Phillip graduated and went to college, so  that was a wonderful thing that we could send him to college in  Stillwater.  He picked a good one to go to. When you were going to school, would  you have to walk back and forth?  Oh, yes. There was no buses    well they had some buses running out, I  think it was either three or four, but I think it was only three that went  different ways out in timbered hills and that was north and east, wasn   t  11  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  it? Yes, north and east of Wann. And then two others that went different  ways out in the country and picked up the kids and brought them into  Wann.  What was the name of your elementary school, do you remember?  That was just Wann School.  It was all grades?  All grades.  She said there was around 400 students there.  It was around Wann and all in through there. At that time they was  drilling; quite an oil boom right in there at that time. It ended up that  they had all of those kids and I don   t know how they ever stacked them  into those rooms  (Laughs) But they said 400 and boy it was thick and  fast, but it was really enjoyable. We had lots of different entertainment.  We had pie suppers, baked pies; each family would bake a pie or  something. They put the pies up there, while we make pies, our folks  would, and all of us would go in there and auction those pies off. That   s  the way the school would make extra money.  Was it through the eighth grade or was it twelve grades?  The eighth grade and then you went into high school and it was just one,  two, three, four.  Did the town  of Wann  have a movie theater or anything like that? Was  it big enough for that?  No, it wasn   t. No, it was just a country town, but it was a nice little  town. It had three churches: a Nazarene, a Baptist, a Methodist and a  Christian. It had four churches.  That   s pretty many for a small town.  That was a lot of people there.  And your first job was in Kansas?  That was in Kansas, just doing housework and I worked four years there  for fifteen dollars a month.  That was a lot, I guess, at that point?  12  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  It was a lot. The folks, when the election came, oh now I can   t think of  his name. He   d run and he was a democrat and they was democrats and  so they said,    Leona, you   ve got to vote Democrat.    So I voted. I was  old enough and I could vote, boy I went ahead and voted Democrat. I  can   t think of that fellow   s name.  For president or for governor?  I think it was for governor. I can   t remember now, I believe it was for  the president. If I could think of his name, Phillip would probably know,  but I can   t think of his name.  It would   ve been about 1929?  Oh, well you   re thinking about Roosevelt then.  Roosevelt?  Roosevelt was president during the Depression. I believe it was   it  seems like it was something like that.  Yeah, he was the democrat for president.  Well, I voted for him.  Yeah, he was the president for ten years. That   s unusual, see, they don   t  let them do that now.  So that was the first time you had voted?  That was the first time. You see, I had just graduated out of high school,  but I was such a baby and not out in the crowd around people. My  mother took me when I was just past six. Took me to school and all I  would do   they had double seats, two kids in each seat in those schools,  and I had to sit with my brother. And at the least little thing, I would cry.  So the teacher put up with it for, I guess, close to a month or something  like that. I never did know exactly, but she told Mama, she said,    She   s  not going to make it.    And Marvin, they began to tease him because he  had to sit with his sister, so they took me out and went to take me out in  public more. By the next year I went to school, but I was a year behind.  So that   s the reason I didn   t graduate in    28; I was a year behind  everything. Should   ve graduated in    28, but I was such a baby (laughs)  not being out, you know. Women didn   t have the opportunity to go too  much and if they went to town once a month, well they did good.  And as soon as you could, you headed to Kansas.  13  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  After I quit there I came back and got a job. I think I worked about two  or three months in Coffeyville for a woman. And then Cecil and I got  married; that was in August. Four and a half to five years that I  worked     You didn   t get married until you quit working?  In August after I     So 1934,    35, something like that?  Yes.  Right in the middle of the Depression.  It was a hard time, but we made it.  Had you gone to school with your husband, the first husband?  No. I knew of him, of course they had wood down in the creek and my  dad would go down there and get the wood and pick up limbs, you  know, dead wood to help heat the house. So us kids would go help get  the wood and we   d meet the Fitzsimmons    and that   s the way we got  acquainted.  Well let me back up a minute. Were your parents from Oklahoma, or did  they come here from somewhere else?  My dad was from Oklahoma. He lived out here beyond Glenoak and  what was that ranch named   ?  Latson Ranch is where     Yes, his folks was Indians and they had, well, land.  An allotment?  An allotment. And lived out there until the boys got old enough and  then, of course, they went to move one way or the other.  And your mother?  My mother was from Missouri. She and her folks lived in Asbury,  Missouri. My dad, for awhile, went up there and worked in the mine, but  he came back and was in the farm and he didn   t want to be in the ground  so went ahead and stayed on the farm until he moved into Wann and  14  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  then he was running a gasoline plant. It was pumping gasoline     They got the gasoline out of the oil and also a paraffin plant. They also  made gasoline, kerosene     They don   t do that anymore?  No. I don   t know how many years he worked there. He worked at that  gasoline plant and we lived in Wann until us kids growed up and they  moved on up into Missouri, first in Coffeyville then on up into Missouri.  My mother   s folks lived in the house, halfway between Joplin and  Pittsburg   Joplin, Missouri and Pittsburg, Kansas. They   re all buried up  there, little old cemetery with the name Opolis. Yes, they   re all buried  up there.  With that many children, how big was your childhood house?  Four rooms.  So the girls all in one room and the boys   ?  On average.  You had to share a bed then?  If we had to, or we slept on the floor. (Laughs) Usually two or three and  the little one would sleep in the bed with the older ones to keep warm.  Kill chickens and pick the feathers, the little feathers, not the big hard  feathers, just the little feathers and save them and get some of that   they  called it chickey, made a feather bed and that helped to keep us warm.  You   d have to flip it and beat it to rearrange the feathers?  Yes. Each night you   d lay down on it and the feathers would go this  way, you know. Of course there was ticking; it wasn   t loose, but that   s  the way you do it. We got by and it helped keep us warm. Time now is  so different. We don   t know what the old people went through.  But everybody was going through it, it seems.  Yes. We   d wear our shoes until they   d fall off our feet. We had long  stockings. Most of them was black or brown, something like that. Tear a  stocking, we had to sew it up. Make it last as long as we possibly could.  Same way with our other clothes.  Hand-me-downs.  15  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Yes. If the older one was a little bit small and the next one to them was a  little big, of course that   s where the clothes would go, to whoever could  wear them.  How did they wash them?  Used a wash tub and wash board.  Out in the yard? Or in the kitchen?  Well, in the summertime it would be out on the back porch and nearly  always a house would have a back porch or a big shade tree and they   d  have an old boiler or tub and they   d build a fire under it and that   s the  way they   d heat the water. Get the water hot and the white clothes, well  they   d boil them. That way they kept white. They   d rinse them a couple  of times through two waters and wring them out by hand, you know,  twist them, wring them. And then hang them out on the line. I hung  Phillip Joe   s old diapers out. I   d take maybe half a dozen out in a little  pan and put some    before I could get them on the line, boy they   d be  froze. They   d whip and whip and finally they   d whip dry and that   s the  way we had to do, just put them on the line. And if it turned bad and  would rain, well we had to just string up the lines in the house and dry  them that way. It was a job to wash, get everything, keep it clean,  especially in the winter time. Now in the summer it wasn   t too bad,  because you could work and work along with the weather and get things  dry, but it was a hard problem.  Did you do special things on holidays, like Christmas or Thanksgiving?  On Christmas we   d have our little Christmas tree and maybe if we didn   t  have money to buy presents or anything, we   d get some fruit and each  one would have maybe an orange or an apple. I can remember when our  Christmas was an orange or an apple. That was our Christmas. No toys,  but if we had a doll or something, the girls, and sometimes people would  make dolls some way. Little kids would be so happy over those dolls  and then the men would whittle out or make a little stick for a horse for  the boys. Have a little kind of a head like and a long   like that   and  they   d put them between their legs and there they   d go. Phillip didn   t  have to do that very much, we got him a little car. Do you remember that  little car, Phillip? He   d ride it around in the house, until it got warm and  then he   d put it out in the yard and rode it around and around.  I had a run of the house, the kitchen and then the rest of it. The three of  us.  Couldn   t get away with anything then, huh?  16  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Not much.  On the Fourth of July, maybe before we had the kids big enough to have  fireworks, we   d have fried chicken and ask some of the neighbors over,  one or two. We   d have fried chicken, usually fryers, you know, and ice  cream. We made ice cream or if we had an ice cream freezer we was  lucky, but usually if we didn   t have an ice cream freezer we put it in the  gallon bucket and put it in ice and salt around it. Every few minutes  we   d take the top off and clean the sides off of it with milk and the ice  cream part on the inside, we   d pry that loose, because it would freeze to  the side of the bucket. So that   s the way we   d make ice cream. And we  got our freezer; we   d have ice cream in that. And ice cream, maybe  some pop, but just depended on how much money we had.  Pop was probably a treat then.  It was a treat. Once in a while, it   d be a bunch of us. There was some  Indian folks that we was acquainted with. We went down on the creek  one Fourth of July and we   d fish and it seems like they had a few  firecrackers that they set off. Down there in the timber they had to watch  it pretty close to keep from starting a fire. Oh, it was quite a time to live  back in those days.  Did you tell her about World War II? A bit about what you remember  about World War II?  No, I don   t remember too much about that.  Your brother was in the service.  Nelson?  Yes.  Yes, we had a hard time, but I really don   t remember too much about  that. Nelson was married and Doris went as close as she could, but when  he was sent overseas, that separated them and he was in Japan.  Yes, in the South Pacific.  And you   re father wasn   t   ?  No, he was too old. His health wasn   t very good either.  On Sundays did you go to church?  17  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  On Sunday, if it wasn   t raining or something, we   d walk to Sunday  school and church. Enjoyed that very much. They had a choir and we  had lots of good music, just singing mostly, but it was very nice and  enjoyable. As I said, those four churches, my sister and I, when Mama  got to where she couldn   t go, lots of times she   d be busy or something or  had a little baby, you know. The baby maybe would be sick or one of us  would be sick and she couldn   t go, then my sister and I would walk and  go to Sunday school and church. Maybe we wouldn   t have any money to  put in, but if we had a penny or a dime or anything well we   d take it and  drop it in. They   d pass it around. It was a hard life, but then at the same  time we got through it and had lots of enjoyable moments out of it.  Well I can   t believe you drove to California by yourself.  (Laughs) Well after I started, I didn   t know whether I   d make it or not,  but then I just kept going and I had the directions and made it just fine.  Did you take Route 66?  Yes. Went through Albuquerque and on through Yuma and on up in  California. I got in there, that wasn   t a problem. I made it. I found the  folks and made it just fine.  What did your folks think about that?  They didn   t know I was going until I was gone. (Laughter) I didn   t tell  them until I got there and I sent them a letter and told them where I was  at. I just decided that I knew they wouldn   t want me to go by myself, so  I didn   t let them know anything about it.  You were brave.  Phillip knew, but he didn   t let it out. He was in college, so he couldn   t  talk to them very much. He   d write to them and    it was a big  experience for me.  And you   ve been back in Bartlesville for how long?  I moved back here from Ardmore after Charles passed on. I moved here  on March 24 in 1990.  Oh, you   ve been here awhile then twenty years?  Yes. I   ve enjoyed my little home a lot.  Well living to be 100, do you have any secrets to share of how you   ve  18  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  managed to be here?  No, I don   t think I have.  You don   t eat an apple every day, or anything like that?  I haven   t done that, I just eat what I decide I want.  How old was your mother when she passed?  She was seventy-five.  Oh, you   ve got her beat by a long shot then.  Yes, she went to my younger sister   s in St. Louis, with Dad and my  aunt. I was still in California. She got sick and they put her in the  hospital and they found out that she   d had a stroke of the intestines.  They said there   s nothing they could do. She just lasted a few days and  passed on. And five days later, the kids and all of us laid Mama to rest.  Five days later, my dad went. I had went back to California, just got  back that afternoon, and went back with a bad cold because coming from  California to here in February, it was a big change and I took cold, went  back sick. I had gone to bed and about 8 o   clock in the evening the  phone rang. They called me and said my dad had passed away with a  heart attack. So both of them passed on in five days. So quite a blow, but  things do happen that way. That   s where they   re buried, at Opolis up  there between Joplin and Pittsburg.  Well genetics doesn   t seem to have much to do with being here 100  years then.  (Laughs) No, it doesn   t.  So it   s living in California then.  I lived out there, I think, around twenty to twenty-four years.  What were fun things to do out there?  Did I have a lot of things to do?  No, about the basketball. You   ve got to tell them about how you like  basketball, Mom.  Oh, I love basketball. You know, I told you I played, but when I went  out there, I went to listening to the Lakers and the basketball games and  19  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  I still listen to the Lakers. I am a Lakers fan. Charles and I would lay  awake and we   d have to get up at 5 o   clock in the morning to go to  work, but maybe it   d be 1 or 1:30 before the ballgame was over. We   d  lay there and go to bed and be resting, but we   d be awake listening to  that ballgame of the Lakers, because out there it was the law, if they  showed it on TV, it had to be at least 100 miles. Where we lived there in  LA, it was only about forty or fifty miles, so all we could do was to get it  on the radio, but we   d lay there and listen. They had some of the best  games. A program here the other night had one of the men that has just  joined the Lakers. They had him on and I couldn   t help but hope and  pray that he makes good. He was a tall fellow and that   s what the Lakers  need now, is somebody tall.  You   re a Kobe Bryant fan?  Kobe Bryant, oh I love him. (Laughs) That poor guy has had some of the  hardest times that ever was.  He   s a great player though.  Oh, he   s something else. He   s had his hand all boogered up and couldn   t  hold the ball hardly, but he   d get out there and play. I watched him at  night and I know the guys was feeding him the ball, but he made sixty-six  points in one night in one game and no one has ever done that only     that is, lately now. That old colored guy, Wilt Chamber lain , made 100  one time, but he was a Laker and I don   t think that    I know that  nobody has ever beat 100 in one game, but he and Kobe, it   s nothing for  him to make thirty-five to forty points in a game if they   re not having  trouble or something. But Kobe, I don   t know, the last few years, if it   s  not one thing it   s something else that happens to him until he can   t play  as good as he ought to, but this last year now he did pretty good. He was  crippled, but at the same time, the other guys helped him until he got by  pretty good and won a championship, anyhow.  College ball, some too. She likes OU and OSU.  But you know, this neighbor over here across the street, we   d talk on the  telephone and he didn   t care about basketball. I kept talking about it and  finally he went to watch and he called me the next day, and he said,     Now them Lakers, they just fell behind and got just within one and here  they went, they beat the other team.    I said,    Well, maybe they did,  maybe they didn   t, I don   t know.    I said,    That   s running a big risk.    We  laughed about it and he was watching all  the games . He   d read the  paper or hear that the Lakers were going to play. If he didn   t catch where  they were going to play or what time, well he   d call me and find out.  (Laughs)  20  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  His daughter took him to the doctor; he had diabetes and heart trouble.  She brought him home and he seemed to be alright and lo and behold,  the next day at noon, they found him. He had died, but he had told the  family that I was the one that had got him watching the Lakers and they  put it in the paper that I was the one that had him a Lakers fan. We  laughed about it, but the poor guy.  And you enjoyed basketball because you played it yourself? Is that why  you like the Lakers so well?  I suppose, but I just dearly loved basketball.  Do you keep up with OSU or OU?  Yes, I try any of them that I can find out about. Why I watch them, any  of those Oklahoma games and some of the others. If I can   t find  Oklahoma or the Lakers or something and there   s another basketball, the  women now. I love to watch some of those women, they   re better than  the men because boy, they can stand back there and shoot those balls  and it don   t seem like it   s any exertion for them to go ahead and make  those baskets.  Pat Head Summit   s got hers going, the UT Lady Vols. She   s done really  well.  Yes, I watch a lot of those girls and I   ve heard some of them have had  babies but they get out there and play. It doesn   t make any difference.  Is there anything else you want to ask?  Mom, tell them a little bit about your neighbors and how they help you  out around here.  Yes, I   ve got some wonderful neighbors, since I   ve got so old. These  folks that live right here in the mobile home next to me, she calls me  nearly every day and comes over. Her husband will do different things. I  didn   t know it but I had mentioned I had some flowers out here on the  fence and I told her maybe a couple, three weeks back, I said,    I   ve got  to get out there and pull that trash off of that fence and get it all cleaned  up for the winter.    Yesterday she came in and she started home and she  said,    Did you see Scott cleaned your fence?    I said,    What?    She said,     Oh, he cleaned your fence. He didn   t get on the inside done, but he  cleaned all of that off.     Then Phillip, I had a row of cedars across the back and the fellow in the  next lot, there was an old tree stump and he set it afire. That scared me  21  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  because those cedars, you know, if they get afire and they   re hot, they go  crazy. So I had Phillip come and cut those cedars down. I was chopping  them up and I   d haul them in my wheelbarrow down here. Scott told his  wife, he said,    I can   t see her out there doing that.    So he backed his  truck up and come over and hauled all of that stuff. He had a friend that  had a ditch or a hole and it made a ditch. He was trying to get it filled  up. He took two truckloads of them cedars and hauled them out to that.  Well I don   t know where it was, but anyhow he dumped it in there.  And then his mother, I call her my angel, when it was so icy and bad last  winter, they didn   t want me to get out on the ice and she drove and she   s  way up, sixty-some odd years, isn   t she Phillip?  Yes, she   s about as old as I am.  Anyhow, she goes every Sunday morning, gets her son a Sunday paper  and she comes back by, gets my paper and brings it and hangs it on my  door. She still does it, when she could be home. I don   t have to go to the  mailbox. She brings my paper Sunday morning, you know. We get a  Sunday morning paper and she hangs it on there. And the neighbor down  on the corner, he takes me to my doctor. I have to go downtown to the  doctor once a month. Since my eyes have gotten bad, all I have to do is  call him and he   ll come and take me to wherever I have to go. I went to  the eye doctor, what was it, last Monday and my eyes is getting so bad, I  can   t see to do any good. So he   s been doing all my driving for me.  But you had driven yourself up until recently?  Oh, I   ve been driving all my life until just since my eyes have got bad  and     She still has her driver   s license.  But the doctor this coming Monday now at 3:10, he   s going to run that  laser around on this eye. He says there   s a film that has covered it and  it   s wrinkled and there   s so many things in writing and things like that,  the paper, I can   t hardly read. I get it a certain way and I can read some.  But he said he thinks it   ll make it a lot better. Phillip told me how to cut  trees down     It   s called    call Phillip.    That   s how you cut trees down.  She has a little electric chainsaw.  I got a little electric saw. It   s about that long and I don   t know if I  22  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  mentioned it, but this fellow on the corner that is so good driving me  everyplace, he started bringing tomatoes. He raised some tomatoes and  some of them big like that. He   d bring Sonny some and he   d bring me  different ones, some of them up on the corner. And one day, the second  time he comes, he said,    You like tomatoes?    and I said,    I sure do.    He  said,    Well, here   s some and I   ve wanted to meet you.    Well we talked a  few minutes and the next time he come, we was talking and I don   t  know if I mentioned sawing trees down or what, but anyhow, he says,     Well I want to see that.     I had planted a couple pear trees out there in the back and those pears  wasn   t worth nothing. They just had hard knots and all. I told Phillip and  I guess I had mentioned something to him that I was going to saw them  down, that I wasn   t going to mow around them. One day he come and he  said,    You feel like sawing them down?    Well he wanted to saw them,  but I tried to tell him, but he made kind of a mess of it, but anyhow, he  got them. About 2/3 of that tree would just go like that because he didn   t  get it in a line like I told him. We finally got that tree down, but then  Lynn told me yesterday, she said she had mentioned to some other  neighbor around here, said Leona sawed trees down and he said,     What?    And she said,    Yes, she saws trees down.    Well he said,    I sure  want to meet her.    (Laughs) I don   t know why they think it   s so funny or  peculiar that a woman with a saw can saw a tree down.  It   s because you   re almost 100.  Well they don   t believe now that I   m out here mowing my own yard.  You mow your own yard?  She runs Mom   s Lawn Service. She   s looking for a man that   s about  fifty years old for a helper though.  Is it a push mower or is it a riding mower?  It   s a self-propelled, electric start, but anyhow, I love to work out in the  yard. I don   t have any flowers or anything and my flowers across there,  since that sun, it used to be straight you know. And it would be shaded;  my flowers would be shaded there and now since the sun has got over  this way, boy the afternoon sun and that awful hot sun, they look terrible  now. They was so pretty, but there   s nothing I can do, I don   t have any  place else to put them. I may bring some of them in this winter, put them  in the garage.  And you mow your own yard?  23  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  I mowed this out here in about, oh, less than two hours and then Phillip  helped me last week wasn   t it? We mowed that and he   d mow while    it  was so hot (laughs) that he   d mow a short time and then he   d drink  water and I   d mow, but I couldn   t see. I   d go along and instead of going  along mowing the line, well I   d get over. I couldn   t see that I was getting  over. My eyes are in bad shape. It   s not just yard work and all. I don   t  know how many afghans that I   ve crocheted. I love to sew and cook. I  don   t know. There   s too many things that I love to do, but it looks like  my time is running out.  So how early do you get up usually?  Well sometimes five or six o   clock. Sometimes it depends on how I feel,  maybe six, seven o   clock.  And stay up until?  I usually, here in the last year, something like that, I   ve been going to  bed around nine, nine-thirty and I   ll put the ballgame on and I   ll sit up  until one, two o   clock if I have to, to see that ballgame. Last winter, lots  of times it was after one o   clock before the Lakers would quit playing. If  they was on TV and I   d sit up and watch them, I   d be so sleepy. Maybe  that morning I   d sleep in until eight o   clock  (Laughs)  When you were in California did you get to go to a Lakers game?  One time. And that   s all I wanted to go. (Laughs) We went to that big  stadium and Charles said,    I don   t want to go, but you want to go.    He  said,    I   ve been there, I know what we   re getting into.    So we went and  we parked and it was some kind of a building that sounded like some  kind of machines or something running. I think it was the air  conditioners or something like that and we come up right by it and then  went in that door. At the half the Lakers was way ahead. Charles said,     Let   s get out of here before the crowd.    He said,    Now you know the  Lakers is going to win.    I said,    Well let   s go.    We went out, but we  didn   t go out the door we came in, we went out another one. We had to  walk clear around that building, that stadium, and by the time we got  around the game was over and the crowd was coming out there where  we was. Charles said,    Well, we got to come.    I said,    Yes, but we  won   t come anymore.    (Laughs) And we didn   t go anymore. Oh, there  was thousands upon thousands of people there, you know, but it was a  lot of fun and I got to see them.  Mom likes to visit with the family and anybody that drops by. She likes  to visit a lot.  24  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Yes, I enjoy visiting with people. I enjoy company. I used to fix big  dinners, but the last two or three years, I haven   t fixed much of a dinner.  That is true. Maybe Phillip and Leona, something like that, but     When you fixed chicken, would you get a whole one and cut it up or do  you get ones already cut?  I used to cut them up myself. I   d rather cut them up myself than to have  the chickens cut up because they cut them different than I ever cut them.  When you cut yours did you have a pulley bone?  Yes.  You can   t get a pulley bone anymore.  No, they cut them in two. That   s the reason I   d rather cut the chicken up  myself, but it   s been a long time since I have gutted them and cut them  up.  How are you going to celebrate your birthday?  Well Phillip has rented this Lion   s Club building down here. You just go  around here and you can see the playground from the front door from  down here. And that   s where we   re going to celebrate. Have people in  there and I was told that Wal-Mart will give me a cake, because I   m a  100 years old, they   ll give the cake. I didn   t know they did that.  They should.  I was told.  One granddaughter that worked at Wal-Mart in the pastry department,  she said that   s the way she did it.  She used to decorate cakes and she could really decorate them. I   ve got  pictures of the last year, my ninety-ninth birthday, she had ninety-nine  candles on that cake and they all stood around and said,    Now you   ve  got to blow them all out.    I had a time of blowing them out, but I finally  got them.  Well is there anything left that you want to do? Have you done  everything on your list of things you wanted to do?  Well, not exactly. I just do as I have to now.  25  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Finchum  You don   t have a bucket list, as they say?  No. I don   t know. I don   t know what I am going to do. I don   t want to  go in a rest home, but I do catch cold easy in the winter time. Last year I  had quite a time, but I don   t know.  You   ve got to hang in there though. In the paper, last week I guess, the  oldest person was 114.  Phillip says I have to live twenty more years.  That sounds good to me.  He keeps telling me that. He   s been telling me that since I was ninety.  He keeps saying,    Well you   ve got to live twenty more years.     Well you look like you   re seventy, so you   ve got at least twenty more  then.  Well my eye doctor the other day, told his friend down here, he said,     Well I wouldn   t have believed       He said,    When I   ve seen her chart,     he said,    She could be eighty-eight, but I don   t think she   s even that.     But he said,    I couldn   t believe it when I looked at her.     And you can still eat whatever you want to eat?  So far.  Not a diabetic or   ?  No I don   t have any    I   ve got one prescription and that costs two  dollars and fifty cents and that   s drops that go in my eyes. That   s the  only prescription.  No high blood pressure or   ?  No, nothing. I take vitamins and Centrum, you know. I have arthritis and  I take pills for that and then I heard about those tablets that would help  make my blood circulation to my brain better, so I take them. But that   s  the extent.  You watch basketball and you mow your yard. You   re covered.  (Laughs) I guess so.  Nothing to stress out over. Well I hope you have a very happy birthday.  26  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Finchum  Fitzsimmons  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  Fitzsimmons  Well I think I will. My folks that was here from Kentucky yesterday, we  was talking and they said,    We   ve got to come back.    The man said,     Well, I   m fat and it   s going to be awful hard to pick up tin cans to sell  to buy gas back here, but I   ve got to do it.    Because he said,    We   re  coming back for your hundredth birthday.     Well are you going to have the party on the date?  It   ll be on the 24th and my birthday is     Of October now, you   re looking at September, see? The 24th is a     Sunday and the 28th is the birthday?  But we can   t get that building on the 24th so that   s     Well, one thing (laughs) they said they   re going to put me in a band box.  I haven   t seen the band box yet, but two years ago on the 15th of  October, I went up to the place to get my driver   s license renewed. I was  having trouble with that machine, or computer, and it   d work a minute  or maybe ten minutes and they had been having trouble, but I didn   t  know. She said,    Well, you can come back any time,    but she said,    We  don   t know when this will work, so we can print your driver   s license.     So I go on down to the store and then come back and when I started to  leave the second time, there was a man sitting in his car or getting out  and he said my ankle turned and I fell halfway down the side of that  building. That place right there it keeps scabbing up and I can put stuff  on it and it   ll peel off and in a short time it peels off again. I bumped my  head there and when I got my driver   s license, three or four days later, I  had tape all over my face because it was black where I had bruised it.  Well that   s what is on my driver   s license now.  I think they need to let you have a retake.  Lo and behold, this last year, I was standing in there at the end of the  divan and what happens? I don   t know, just like up there, I didn   t realize  or know what was going to happen in here. I had my gown on and robe  and lo and behold I was looking at a number and I couldn   t see it like I  wanted to. I just thought, well I   ll go in the kitchen where there   s light  and I started, but I ended up with my head    I hit that coffee table, the  corner of it, busting my head open up here, bleeding and skinned it the  17th day of October. That was last year, now what they   re going to do, I  don   t know, but that was the 17th.  We   re going to have to put a box over her, I guess.  27  Carroll  Finchum  Carroll  (Laughs) They took me over, I called my neighbors over here and the  first time they didn   t answer, well I called Larry and he didn   t answer,  and I called Lynn again and that time her husband answered and I said,     I fell and I   m bleeding, my head   s bleeding, I busted my head open.     He said,    We   ll be right there.    Well about five minutes, here both of  them come. While I was waiting for them, I call Larry again. When he  heard me that I fell, he said,    I heard what you done.    I told him on the  first time, he says,    I   m on my way.    So they all got here and they took  me over here and they run me all through that hospital and they said I  didn   t have any concussion but it has affected my memory. There   s  times, well you   ve noticed that I can   t think and here day before  yesterday, I seen on TV and they say that anybody that has fell and hurt  their head bad, it said you may not have a concussion, but thinks they  have tissues around their brain, a lot of the time and it will affect their  hearing as well as their mind. I didn   t know that.  Well I think we   re about finished. Thank you for having me today and  happy birthday a little early.  Well, I sure appreciate it and hope that everything goes okay.  -------  -------
