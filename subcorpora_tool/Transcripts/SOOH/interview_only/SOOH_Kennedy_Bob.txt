 Finchum  Kennedy  Today is September 24, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University, and we   re here today with Bob Kennedy,  who retired from Cooperative Extension service in 1975 after twenty-five  years with the program. Thank you for having me today.  Well thank you for coming.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood, where  you were born, and that type of thing, and we   ll work our way forward.  Well, you will have never heard of where I was born. You ever hear of  Ninnekah, Oklahoma?  I have not, no.  Okay, it   s about thirty miles south of Pocasset.  I haven   t heard of that either.  I know you hadn   t. Nobody ever hears of those. But  Pocasset is north   of Chickasha. You   ve heard of that. So I was born in Ninnekah,  Oklahoma,  south of Chickasha,  and we lived there for a couple of  years, I guess. Of course, I don   t remember any of that. Then we moved  to Muleshoe, Texas, and lived there for a little bit. Then we moved to  Pocasset, Oklahoma, and that   s where I spent my childhood days, in  Pocasset. I ran across a guy the other day, and he said,    Hey, Kennedy, I  went through Pocasset.    I used to brag about the fact that it had the  longest Main Street of any city in the United States. And I thought,     That   s something to brag about.    Well, it   s Highway-81. That   s the  main street that goes through Pocasset. It   s just about eleven miles north  of Chickasha.  5  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  We grew up there, I lived on a farm, and we had a lot of cattle, a lot of  farm, a lot of cotton, a lot of corn. I was the number ten child in our  family, so I had a lot of guidance in my raising up. A lot of brothers and  sisters, and so they taught me well. I went through all of my schooling  and everything at Pocasset. Then I left there, I graduated from there, and  of course, it was a small school. Being a small school and a small  person, you can become big pretty easy, see. So I thought I was top of  the rung, there. We lived there until I graduated from high school in  Pocasset. Then I went to school at Oklahoma A M. To make a long  story short, I went there a year, then I went to Cameron one semester,  then I finished up at Oklahoma A M. Then it changed to Oklahoma  State University, so then I became a member of the university. Well, I  didn   t go to work, I didn   t become a member then, because then I went  back to school and I got my master   s degree. It was still Oklahoma  A M at the time I got my master   s degree.  And what year was that?  I should have been better prepared on these years.  That   s okay, let   s back up. What year did you graduate from high  school?     45.  So you would have entered OAMC the first time     In    45. Yeah.  Okay. That helps.  I went a year, and then I went to the army. Spent eighteen months in the  army. When the war was over, it was shortly after I went in, really, so it  was like 1946. Then I spent my years trying to go to OSU, Oklahoma  A M, then it changed to OSU, and so I got my graduate degrees from  A M and graduate degrees from OSU. See, I brag about all these  degrees I   ve got, and but they were all in agriculture.  And where did you live when you were on campus?  Well, I lived at the fire station, because that was the only place that I  could afford to live. I could live at the fire station and work as a part-time  fireman, and get my lodging free. So my room then only cost me  twenty dollars a month. That way I managed to work enough to pay my  own way through college.  6  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Did you have any classes in Old Central?  Old Central? That was where they had English, and yeah, I had classes  there. That   s right. I had my English classes in Old Central. It was an old  building back then.  It   s in pretty good shape now. Were you on the livestock judging team or  anything like that?  Well, I was, and I hate to tell you this, but we were trying out for  livestock judging. I had it won, and there was a little gal come in from  Walters, Oklahoma, I think, and beat me out.  A girl?  A girl beat me out of the livestock judging team. I don   t tell that to very  many people. In fact, there   s some people around here that I wouldn   t  dare let them know that. But I was on the livestock team. I never did  play football or never did play sports in college. I was going to walk on  football, because I figured I was tougher than what I really was. Bob  Fennimore, I remember him. He was one of the hot shot football players  at that time. I walked on. I went up there to try out for football, and after  I got hit a few times by those people up there, I decided that really,  Pocasset is not good background (laughs) training for football for  college. I dropped out pretty quick, really, so I never did do college  sports. I just never did have the time, because I had to work. I worked  my way through school, and this was quite an effort there, too. All the  different jobs I had, everything from driving taxi cabs to sweeping out  dorms for twenty-five cents an hour while I was in college.  Were you the first in your family to go to college?  Well, no, about the second, really. I had a brother older than me, he  managed to work his way through college. And I had a sister that my  dad helped go through college, but we just couldn   t afford for me to go  to college. But I wanted to go, and so I decided to. He was good about it.  He said,    Well, son, I   ll help you all I can.    That was not enough, but we  managed. I kept a job. I knew how to work.  So the first job I had when I was going up there was driving a taxicab,  and that was a pretty good job. Then I finally found a place to stay, and  that   s when I ended up with the fire station, because I found out I could  stay at the fire station free if I   d fight fires. They fed me for twenty  dollars a month. Well there wasn   t any other place I could get food like  that, so I stayed a fireman, then, for the rest of my college life, but then I  also had to have a job, too. So I worked at the grocery stores, I worked  7  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  down at supermarkets and all that sort of stuff, as well as drove a cab. So  I got all that, and I finally got my degree, and finished up there. It  seemed like it took me a long time. You don   t carry too many hours     When you   re doing two jobs or more.  Yeah, you   re doing two or three jobs and all that stuff. It was an  experience.  When you weren   t working or studying, what did you do for fun?  Well, I didn   t have a whole lot of fun. Oh, I played tennis. I was a pretty  good tennis player, and then I   d go fishing, and that was pretty much it,  really.  What brought you to OAMC? Were you in 4-H?  Yes, I was in 4-H.  Do you go to Roundup?  Well, no. I never did get to go to Roundup, but I remember the county  agent that was county agent when I was there, and I   d see him operate.  I   d say,    That   s what I want to do.     That was in high school, then?  I was about in upper grade school. Just barely old enough for 4-H.  And what was his name? Do you know?  Well, I don   t remember.  We can go back and look it up.  He was county agent. Then I remember my first experience in 4-H was I  showed chickens at the county fair, and my brother and I, which he was  just older than me, we went out and caught some chickens out of the  barnyard. We decided we   d just show chickens. And so we had one  other fellow there at school that was in 4-H. They raised chickens, and  he was always bringing his ribbons to school, showing how much he   d  won. Well, it just so happened, my brother and I, we picked out three or  four chickens a piece. We took them to the fair, and I won it, and beat  this guy that had been showing off his ribbons all these years. Ever since  then I wanted to win. (Laughs) If I remember, his name was Robinson. I  did that and I won some money. The county, they paid a little bit of  8  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  money for those prizes, you know, like a dollar or two, something like  that. So I started showing anything I could get my hands on: goats, pigs.  That started my showing career, really. Then my dad got me calves and I  started showing calves, and so that was the beginning of my 4-H  showing. My dad gave me livestock to show.  I   d call it mine. This was an interesting thing. Back in those days, they  would be yours until he got ready to sell them. All of the sudden, you   d  go out there and find them gone.    What happened to my calf?       Well, I  sold that dude.    I never did say anything, because I was taught not to say  anything. That   s the way we were raised, back then, just to keep your  mouth shut and do what you   re told. Those are different than today   s  days, a little bit. But anyway, that started my interest in 4-H.  Out of that, I thought, that   s a pretty interesting life. I can almost call  this county agent   s name. He was county agent in Chickasha, my county  agent back then. I looked to him. He really didn   t teach me anything  other than the fact that he dealt with livestock, and poultry, and those  things, and then we made trips. It was things that I never got to do on the  farm. I decided then that   s a pretty neat kind of a life, so I decided it   d  just be alright for me to be a county agent.  And that led you to OAMC.  Yes. That led me to OAMC. That   s right.  Well, when you were doing your chickens, did you have to slaughter  them yourself?  Oh no, no. They weren   t mine, really. At that time, I thought they were.  I claimed them. It was kind of more of that claiming business, see. They  were my chickens, and I did get to keep the dollar or two that I won off  of them. But no, they went back home and sat on the nest and became  part of a flock of two hundred chickens or something.  Your mother managed those, or someone else?  Oh, no. Back then, they were just part of our flock. If it had been any  other way, I probably wouldn   t have had them. Every year we raised a  lot of grain. My dad was very innovative, and he had a thrashing  machine. We thrashed for everybody in the country. I was too little to  pitch a bundle and run a bundle wagon then, but I water jacked. So he  would set me on the horse and saddle and hook a water jug across the  saddle horn, and hit that old horse on the rear end, and I   d go water the  hands. We thrashed from eight bundle wagons, a crew of eight. I  watered all them people until I got big enough to run a bundle wagon  9  Finchum  Kennedy  myself then he kicked me off of the horse and put me on a bundle  wagon, and we were still thrashing then. We probably had two or three  hundred acres of wheat and oats that we grew that we thrashed. And  then we   d thrash for everyone else in the country, everywhere we could  pull that thrashing machine, really. That was my summer life.  Not much fun.  No. There was no playing. The only playing that I did was at night.  When we   d get through thrashing, we   d go over to the farm pond and go  take a bath, go swimming. I called it swimming. It wasn   t anything but  taking a bath and washing that crud off of you. That was the only life we  had. I didn   t know it was any different anywhere, see. We never had any  money. I   ll never forget one time, I found a dime. That   s the first money  I ever had. I think I was in either the second or third grade. I had a dime  all to myself, and nobody else had any   my brothers and sisters, you  know. And I didn   t tell them anything about it, see. So we walked to  school. We had to walk two miles to school. We walked to school and  back, and I didn   t tell them. We went to the little town of Pocasset. I  went downtown during the lunch hour, took my dime, and I bought ten  cents worth of licorice candy. That started my sweet tooth, I guess, I  have. My wife tells me I have a sweet tooth. I   ve got to have candy.  So I started that, and I got that big sack of licorice candy for a dime. By  the time I got that half gone, I was about halfway home. I couldn   t eat  anymore, and I wasn   t about to tell my brothers and sisters anything  about it, even though we were walking home together. I was clever  enough that I could eat it and them not know what I was doing. So I   d  eat it, and then finally we got to a bridge and I thought,    Well, I can   t eat  any more of this, what am I going to do?    I hid it. I made out like I  wanted to go to the bathroom, and I went underneath that bridge and I  hid it so I could get it the next day. So I ate licorice then all week off of  that sack that I had hid underneath that bridge. I   d eat every time I  walked to and from school. So you had to manage, see. I learned to  manage from quite young, really. I   ve been managing ever since, really.  But that was good training.  I finished at Pocasset, then. I decided I didn   t want to farm, didn   t want  to do anything else, I wanted to go to college. Well, only one of my  other brothers and sisters ever went to college. I said,    I don   t want to  farm.    So I told them I wanted to go to college.    Where are you going to  go to college?       Well, I don   t know.    And so I started finding out. It was  Oklahoma A M Agriculture College. That   s the only thing I knew was  agriculture. So I went up there and,    How are you going to do it?        Well, I   ll find a job.    Well, I did. And so I hunted jobs from that day  on. That   s the first time I ever had a job that I got paid for, because as  10  long as you   re working on the farm, you don   t get paid for that.  We graduated in    45. I get to thinking back, and today all these trips  these people take, these seniors. My senior trip was, they finally got  school buses there, and so we took a school bus and drove all the way  down to Turner Falls one day and back, and that was our senior trip.  (Laughs) I get to thinking today,    Man, what a lavish life we lived back  then.    But, it was better than anybody else had, and so I kind of lived the  rest of my life trying to go for that rule. Just do as well as you can, and  hopefully it   s as good as everybody else.  I graduated from there, then I decided I wanted to go to college. So then  we had another maneuvering to do to try to find me money to go to  college. There were another couple of guys there that went to college,  and they told me how to do it. They said,    You can go up there to this  fire station  in Stillwater . They   ll keep you just so you   ll fight fires. For  twenty dollars a month, they   ll feed you.    Well, I went up there, the big  old college campus of Oklahoma A M at the time, and I thought, man,  you talk about a kid being out of place. But I thought,    I   ll manage.     And I did. They took me to the fire station. In fact, at the time, we had  paddles. All new firemen that come on they make you a paddle. The  assistant fire chief was a woodworker and a painter, so he made  everybody a paddle, and then he painted their name on it. So for twenty  years or so my paddle hung up there in the fire station, with all hundreds  of other paddles hanging around there, with my name on it. Then you  went through, I don   t remember what we called it then. It was kind of  like in the Roughnecks you went through an initiation period. We got  through that and you got to hang your paddle up on the wall. I   d go back  to the fire station then, and for many years go up and look at my paddle  hanging on the wall up there.  The only advantage I had was if you were a fireman, you could leave  class and fight fires. You   d hear the fires go off here and you could hear  them all over campus. We   d hear a siren go off, well then us that were  firemen, we   d get up and walk out. Man, I had a privilege there that  nobody else had. So it was quite a life. We stayed there at the fire  station, and fought a lot of fires. Every time we had a fire, well we went  on it. I don   t even remember now how many firemen we had. There  were probably fifteen or twenty of us, volunteers is what they called us.  We all stayed up there at the fire station. It   s still there on campus. There  up at the top there, they had bunks all the way around that thing, and  that   s where we lived. They had a big kitchen there, and that   s where we  ate. Had two poles you slide down, so that was my life there for several  years. I enjoyed that. In fact, I had some certificates here somewhere  from things I earned during firefighting.  11  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  What happened to the paddle? Do you know?  No, I don   t. Because I went back out there and they   d changed chiefs  and assistant chiefs and all that. That one   s gone, but then I had another  one that he fixed up for me. I had it around because it had my name on  it. The name was pretty well dissolved off, but that   s one thing I should  have found and looked up before you came.  If you did that much work for them, you could   ve chosen to go down that  path instead of ag?  Oh yeah, very easily. In fact, I did to some degree, because after about  three years of college, I went home, and in the summer time, there at  Chickasha, I talked to those people, and they saw the experience that I  had in fire training. They said,    Well, why don   t you go to work for us?     And I said,    Well, I don   t live here in town.       Well, you can live here.     So I lived there at the fire station for a year and was a fireman for the  Chickasha Fire Department. Then I finally decided,    No, this is not  going to cut it. This is not where I need to go. I mean, surely I can do  better than this.    So I dropped back out and finished college. In fact, I  had a couple of the guys there, the chief, the assistant chief was telling  me,    You need to go back and get your education.    So with their  encouragement I went back and finished college, got my degree.  And then what?  Then after that, I went to work for Pigskin Davis. I couldn   t get a job in  agriculture. It was just not available, you know, but Frank Baker, you   ve  probably heard of him, was director of Extension at the time. I got  acquainted with him, and he tried to find me a position someplace, and it  didn   t work. So, I went to work at Pigskin Davis there in Tulsa. Just a  job. After I was there awhile, I said,    This is not it. It   s not what I need  to be in.     So I started hunting, then, for another position somewhere. I had a  brother-in-law then that was a Vo Ag teacher in Ramona. He says,    You  need to get up here and find you a job.    So I went to work in  Bartlesville. I worked there for a while, and decided, well, I need to go  back. This is still not what I wanted to do. So, I got ahold of Frank  Baker, and he had some power with the university at the time. I got a job  as assistant county agent.    Well, where are you going to be?    I said,    I  don   t care. Just give me the job.    So they sent me to Muskogee. And I  said,    I don   t know anything about Muskogee.    And they said,    You  don   t have to know anything about Muskogee. Just know what you   re  doing.    And I said,    Well, I know what I   m doing.     12  So I moved, and I was 4-H agent in Muskogee for five years. That   s  when I met Bill Parnum, and he was county agent over here at the time.  You got acquainted with everybody in Extension. I finally decided that  if I   m good enough here, I said, I   ll make here as 4-H agent, I gave  myself five years to be able to do something better, to get an  advancement of something. About five years later, well they said,    You  want to go to Tahlequah?       Yeah, I   ll go to Tahlequah.    I didn   t know  anything about Tahlequah, but that they   ve got a lot of strawberries over  there. So I said,    Well, I know about them.    I moved from Muskogee to  Tahlequah as an associate county agent. Then I worked with a specified  handful of farmers around, most of them growing strawberries in  Cherokee County.  Then times started changing in Extension. 4-H agents left here and left  here and left here, leaving little holes in Extension, so I ended up back in  4-H. That   s when I was meeting 4-H with this young lady that came on  to work, and that   s when I was telling Roger the story about the turtles  eating the tires off of the car. Oh, I didn   t tell you that, did I? Well,  Norma Brumbaugh was the lady that took over. As a lady, I don   t know  what they called them back then, but she wouldn   t hire a married girl.  We needed a lady 4-H agent, so she brought on this little girl, and she  was just fresh out of school, as green as a gourd. I had a lot of fun with  her.  We had thirty-three 4-H clubs that we met with every month, and so we  would take turns driving. They were scattered all over Cherokee County.  At that time, there was not one mile of paved road in this county. They  were all gravel, and there were a lot of streams, a lot of low water  bridges. So we   d make those. She was a pretty good driver, I guess, but  she drove so slow. I can   t tell you her name now, because I   ve forgotten  it, but I   d tell her,    We   ve got to speed up. We   re not going to make this  other 4-H club.    We had them timed up, you know, we   d be here at one  o   clock, two o   clock, three o   clock. We   d go across a bridge, some of  those low water bridges, we   d cross water as wide as from here to that  wall over yonder. And she   d just creep across it. And I remember telling  her, I said,    Sugar, if you don   t speed up a little bit, the turtles are going  to eat the tires off of your car.       Really?    She believed that. I didn   t say  any more about it.  Cleo Bryan was the home economist then. She   s the home  demonstration agent, what she was then. She come back and said,     Cleo? Bob was telling me that if I don   t speed up going across these  low water bridges, that the turtles will eat the tires off my car. Is that  true?    So she believed it. But Cleo straightened her out pretty quick,  said,    No, that   s not going to happen.    It didn   t speed her up any, but we  met the clubs, and we met a bunch of them. I wish I could remember her  13  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  name. She was just the sweetest little ol    girl, but she was as na  ve as  you ever saw anybody being na  ve about water, and streams, and  country living, and what we were doing. But she did a good job of what  she had to do.  We did that, and then finally, I   d get on my district agent then, I forget  now which one was my district agent at the time. I said,    We   ve got to  have some help.    So they got me, at the time I   d kind of reverted back  from associate county agent to assistant county agent, working with 4-H  clubs. Then I kindly got my advancement back, and I was associate  county agent working with farmers. So then I got back in the farming  market then. We hired Bob Henfield and a dozen other 4-H agents. I   ve  got a lot of articles here on things they did, places they went, you know.  But I was always there to help, and I never did really lose track of what  was going on. And then, after a while, I became county agent. I talked to  farmers, ranchers, and offices, all that other stuff, then. I held that  position for, I don   t know, ten, fifteen years. That   s when I kind of made  all the headlines here, you know, the clippings that I   ve got here of the  different organizations that I belonged to, awards that I won and  everything. But it was a very interesting life.  I   m assuming you had some interesting questions come up along the  way.  Oh, yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely.  What were a few of the craziest ones? Or strangest ones?  Well, the one that gives me the most mileage is the turtles eating the  tires off the car going across these low water bridges, because we had so  many of them. As I was looking through my clippings here, one of the  things, I helped one of the farmers with a new invention that really never  did get off of the ground that still needs to be taken care of, and that   s  developing an instant all-range element for stoves. This shows here what  happened. He was a farmer, lived out there by me, and I helped him  develop this cooking element. When you turned it on, the heating  element would come up. It would come up about that far, and hit the  pan. You turned it off, it dropped down. So it was called    instant off     range. It   s still a good idea. People still have trouble burning stuff,  because on these electric ranges, you know what I   m talking about.  Here   s a picture of the inventor, here, that I worked with. We never did  get that off of the ground. See, we tried to do it ourselves. If we   d have  turned it over to General Electric, or Westinghouse, or some of those  other people, they would   ve kicked it off. But that   s what you get for not  knowing. And so that   s one of the other interesting experiences, helping  14  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  him develop that.  So the idea was if there was a problem, you tried to find a practical  solution?  Oh, yeah. Here   s our staff. When we moved in, we went from county  agent to Extension Center, and we had new signs here. That   s when we  had the county agent   s office down the street here, and this was our staff.  Would   ve been in the sixties?  In the sixties.    69 is when we opened that office, and then we built that  building down there where the offices are now. We had a lot of  cattlemen   s organizations. Here   s a picture of the Cherokee County  Cattlemen   s Association. I organized that and developed the Cherokee  County Cattlemen   s Association, so that is very active now. Every  county has a cattlemen   s association, but they didn   t have it back then.  So your position at that time was considered a very prestigious one?  Oh yeah.  For the county?  Yeah. And here   s the show pictures, show ring.  Showing photos  That   s  what we used to get paid with. There   s ten cents there in script money.  When I was in the army, I was overseas and they didn   t pay you with  money. They paid you with script, so everything was paper, like that.  You could   ve bought more licorice for that.  Yeah, I could   ve done that with a dime, couldn   t I?  When you first started, did you have someone that mentored you, that  showed you the ropes, or that you looked up to for that type of help?  Well, not really. You figured them out. You planned them out, you  know. It   s kind of like when I moved over here as county agent, you  know, what does a county agent do? Well, you work with farmers. Well,  you get two or three farmers coming in, you can figure out right quick  what you need to be doing, if you   ve got any sense at all. So I took pride  in the fact that I could figure things out. And I knew how to kind of  organize people and things, and so it kind of went from there to the point  that I got involved with all the civic organizations that I needed to. In  other words, the two prominent ones here in town were the Lion   s Club  and the Kiwanis Club, so I got involved with the Lion   s Club. I went  15  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  through all the offices of the Lion   s Club. That was part of my training,  too, as Extension agent, because I was OSU Extension Director, but I  didn   t know it. I was county agent, and that   s what all those plaques and  stuff up there are for.  Making lots of contacts?  Oh yeah. Working with people. I was a people person.  Had to have a good sense of humor, then, I bet?  We had to have, yeah. (Laughs) I know a few people that are gone from  here that didn   t have one. They   re not around any longer. I mean, you  know, if you can enjoy life, and if you want to do a good job at anything,  you   ve got to enjoy what you   re doing. So if you   re going to enjoy what  you   re doing, you   ve got to have a decent sense of humor, don   t you?  Those are the principles that I lived by there for years here is I wanted to  maintain a good sense of humor and help as many people as I could with  things they needed. If I didn   t know anything about it, then I knew how  to find it. I   d find the answers, and that   s what Oklahoma State did for  me. I could go to Oklahoma State and get answers. If it wasn   t in  agriculture, I knew where to go to find it. If it   s in agriculture, I pretty  well knew it myself. But it   s been a real journey, been an enjoyable life,  really.  And was it an eight to five job?  (Laughs) Let   s see, how did I hear somebody mention it the other day?  Instead of being from eight to five it   s like five to eight, like five o   clock  in the morning to eight o   clock at night. It was seven days a week. But I  let it be that way. You could let it be whatever you wanted it to be, and  as long as you   re helping people, time was of no importance to you. I  just did what I could do to help other people. I looked to, see that little  saying there on that rock?   Reads rock     You can get everything in your life you want, if you help  enough other people get what they want.     Yeah. That was my philosophy. And so I kind of like that, I carry a  penny around with me, Abraham Lincoln. He was one of my favorite  people. There   s a new penny out, I bet you hadn   t even seen it.  They   re changing them. I know that.  Yeah. It   s him sitting on a log.  16  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  They feel lighter too, don   t they?  Yeah. I don   t even have a good    I do have a magnifying glass, too. I  was going to say, I don   t even have a good magnifying glass any more.  Used to when I was looking for pecans, I   d carry a magnifying glass  around with me. I always look at it and find somebody that can tell me  what that is on the other end of that log he   s sitting on.  It looks like there   s a mallet, but other than that, I don   t know.  Well, there   s an ax there, laying up on the right hand side of him. Then  on the left there, I cannot figure out, but it may be that he was showing  part of a split log there or something.  What were some of the other tools of the trade, then, if you had to carry  a magnifying glass? What else would you have with you?  Oh, well, a knife. A good grafting knife to graft pecans, to graft plants. I  used to grow orchids. Did I show you that picture of those orchids? A  doctor friend of mine here in town, his name was Dr. Masters, had some  orchids, and he taught me how to propagate orchids from one, to change  their blooms, to change their blossoms and stuff. So I grafted some  orchids, and at the time, then I started grafting pecans. So that   s when I  kind of got interested in the pecan business, and I   ve got some pictures  here. Used to have field days, because people like to improve varieties  of pecans, big paper shell pecans. I   ve got some pictures here  somewhere showing where I   m grafting pecans. Taking that wood and  taking my pocket knife, and I   d take it and graft what we call a side  wood off of an improved variety and put it on a native, and have me a  big tree. So I   ve got paper shell pecan trees all over this county. When I  first moved here, I did a lot of grafting, because nobody else had ever  done anything like that. I   d buy the pecan wood from OSU Horticulture  Club. They   d cut the wood, and I   d order it in sticks about like this, and  so I   d hold pecan grafting demonstrations. I   d get the farmers in and I   d  teach them how to graft their own trees. So, that   s my tool, a big healthy  pocket knife. I carried that with me all the time, and so a lot of it was  based around growing pecan trees.  Then we had a lot of insects that we had to identify that sometimes they  took a little bit of looking. I have a magnifying glass that I always kept  in my pocket. About ten or fifteen years ago, I quit carrying it, and I kept  it in my desk. I   d slide it out, and I could look and identify case barrow.  These are my teaching tools, here.  What was your favorite thing to teach?  17  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Well, I guess really pecan grafting was one of my favorites.  Showing  photo  This is a bunch of county agents here at a national county agent   s  convention.  And you worked closely with Cleo  Stiles Bryan ?  Oh, yeah.  I   m told she had a good sense of humor.  Yeah. She was my buddy. Yeah. We did things together. I got her to  move from Garvin County up here. I was county agent here, and so I  needed a home demonstration agent, and so I managed to get her to  move up here, and then we had it to ourselves for a few years. She was a  dandy.  You switched counties some. Is there much difference between counties?  Oh, not really. Some counties were peanut counties. I mean, the crops  that they grew were different. Cattle, a cow was a cow. A Hereford was  a Hereford, you know. Some areas had predominately this, or something  else, you know. Some of them were stronger in dairy animals, and some  of them were stronger in swine. You come over here now, and it   s  changing into goats. Well, see, we raised goats. I remember one  particular time when I was growing up, I had a pet goat. Called him  Billy Button. But, he ran into trouble. Back during those days, the cars  had canvas tops on them, and so I really don   t know what the guy   s  name was, or what he was doing out there, but he came out to the farm.  He drove this roadster out there and it had a canvas top on it there. Here  come Billy Button, jumped right up on top of that thing, and when he  jumped all four legs went right down through it. (Laughs) And so my  dad hollered at me, said,    Get this goat out of here     I finally got him off  of the car and got him out of there.  Well, the next day, that goat was hanging up in the slaughter house. He  killed that sucker and we ate him. You know, going out to find out,     You killed Billy Button?       Well, Son, we can   t keep stuff around here  that destroys.    And I said,    That   s the only thing he   s destroyed.       No,     then he started telling me all the stuff he   d destroyed. Well, he was my  buddy. He had horns that wrapped around here. He was really too old to  eat, but we ate him anyway. I said,    Well, I   m not going to eat any of  him.    The next day, I was eating him. (Laughs) Those were treacherous  days of growing up.  Goats are coming out here now and they   re showing goats a lot now.  Our county fair this year had more goats in it than anything else. Well,  18  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  see, that didn   t used to be. In fact, you never showed a goat. A goat was  just something to eat brush and shrubbery and stuff, cause mischief and  get into trouble. But now they   re becoming an asset to some of the  farmers in some of the areas, because what they will eat what other farm  animals won   t eat. So in fact, if you want a piece of land cleared up, just  turn a herd of goats in there. They   ll eat all that crap that the cows and  horses and stuff like that won   t eat. So, they   ve got a place in there, in  their life. You   ve just got to understand them.  Now, if they could eat red cedar, they   d be really good, wouldn   t they?  Oh, wouldn   t that be the truth? Yeah, there ain   t nothing in the world. I  ain   t found any bugs that   ll eat that. I   ve got a container at home that one  of my friends made me out of red cedar, and in fact, one of the guys that  lives in one of my farm houses, he   s good at woodworking. I said,     Well, we need to line one of these closets up with cedar.    So what  Dave figured out is he had the saw down there in my greenhouse (I   ve  converted my greenhouse now to a junk house). He   s got my table saw  set up down there. He cuts wood, cuts and makes stuff, and he brought a  whole package of cedar sawdust up. You smell it, and I mean, you   ve  got that old cedar smell to it. She packages it up in little packages and  takes it down here to the county fair and gives it away, or sells it, or does  something with it there, and so it has its benefits. There   s something  good about everything, if you can find it. (Laughs) But it   s one of those  things that sometimes you have to really look hard in order to find  something that   s beneficial.  This is showing you here a sprig of new Bermuda grass that we tried out  that didn   t work. It   s seven foot long. Out here on the farm, I   ve put a  demonstration plot out there, and so that   s history. Here   s a picture of  when I was in Bartlesville, of the municipal judge and I when we were  setting up a course with the university. One thing that I did while I was  up there is I set up a lot of Extension courses, and they were everything  from municipal training to just everything. I   d bring in a teacher from  Stillwater or from somewhere to teach the course, and I would set it up  as an Extension course. That   s just a picture of a Bartlesville judge, that  we were setting up a     It   s stamped 1975?  Yes. Now, this is an interesting program here that we started. Cleo and I  started this one right here: Government Day. At the time, they were  having, the cities, in other words they   d have the high schoolers and  they   d get a judge, they   d give somebody a job for a day to be judge,  police chief and all those things. Well, we did it for 4-H, and we called it  Government Day. So we had one day where we had a 4-H member that  19  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  was every kind of law official, every kind of elected official, every kind  that there was in the county. Cleo worked that with me, and she was     Had you talked to Cleo? Did you know her?  No. I   ve talked with her step-children.  Well, we did that, and then that   s when Senator Harris was the main  senator. We got him to come in here, and he was the speaker at our  Government Day program. Everybody come in,    You mean you got the  senator to come in here?    Well, see, at that time, nobody had ever had  anybody come in here before that amounted to anything politically. I  took him and his son on a float trip. We fished that day, then we had  quite an activity here, and so we got a lot of play out of this Government  Day. I thought the university was going to pick this thing up, and have  Government Day in all the counties. A few of the counties tried it, but it  didn   t work. I don   t see anybody making an effort for it anymore. But it  was quite popular around here. It stirred up a lot of activity in 4-H as  well as city and county offices were concerned.  Was it easy to get in touch with your political person at the Capitol?  Fred Harris.  Was it easy to do that?  Well, yes, because I knew him. You grow up knowing people. And you  never put anything aside that you think you might use later on. You  know about that. But no, I did those things, because I knew I could do it.  Well, did you have to go down to the Capitol and lobby any?  Oh, no. No. It was interesting here because all I did here was, like here it  says, (reads)    I salute this 4-H for what it has done, praised the US  Senator Fred R. Harris as he spoke to over three hundred people in the  ballroom of the college at Northeastern.    So we had a big recognition  deal up at the college, and of course, I worked it out with the college to  be able to do that. If you   ve got somebody speaking, like Fred, the main  senator, and at that time, he was getting ready to run for President and a  few other things, so he was very popular. I took him out on a float trip,  and you do a few things for people, and it has a way of coming back to  you, if you do what   s right. That   s kind of like that little deal there. If  you do what   s right for people long enough, then some of the right stuff  will have a way of working its way back around, come back home to  you. So, this was probably one of the more popular things that we did  for a while was create Government Day.  20  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  You did it more than one year?  Yes. And I don   t remember the history of it, really. But it lasted. Each  one of the 4-H clubs then would elect officers, and then we   d have those  people come into town. So, I had it worked out with all the political  officers, the county commissioners and the assessors and all of those  people to take these 4-H members into their office for a day. Oh, it was  good. It was a good program. I thought it was an excellent program. If  you don   t have somebody taking care of that, it has a way of  disappearing back into the woodworks. But it was a good program.  Career day, you would think maybe some of those kids went on to do  that job themselves.  Oh, I know they did. I know they did, because we   ve got some of the  judges here were excellent 4-H members that I taught bringing up there,  and they are very popular in the law offices and stuff. Yeah, I   ve seen  them develop and go through. And a district judge, associate judges and  all this stuff here. In fact, the important judges here in the county were  some of the people in this training program.  That   s rewarding, too, to see the     Yeah. To think, I knew them here. Brought them into 4-H, and then, of  course, I run across this picture here of Charles Lester. He   s dead now,  but he was assistant 4-H agent. He was assistant county agent.  Did he also play Pistol Pete when he was at OSU?  Yes, yes. He was the first Pistol Pete.  I thought that name was familiar. But he was an agent himself?  Yeah, right here.  I didn   t know that.  Yeah, and so I   ll show you his picture here.  So he was here when Cleo was here, too.  Put your finger on him and I   ll show you. Well, here   s a close-up picture  of Cleo and Charlie.  Do you know of any of your former 4-Hers that went on to be county  agents themselves?  21  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Well, I was trying to think here. I hadn   t stopped to think back, see if  any of these guys went into Extension or not.  Well, with thirty-three clubs over how many years, you   d think maybe at  least one did.  Oh, I   m sure they did.  Are there that many clubs today?  Oh, no. No. In fact, here in this county, back then every little school had  a 4-H club. That was one of the most important parts of that school was  that 4-H club. There were thirty-three in 1960. Well, since then, I don   t  know, there may be eight or ten 4-H clubs now, because they   ve  combined. They   re in the public school systems and all these little  schools that are going here, they   ve gone out. So if you don   t have  somebody running something like that, well then it merges over here  with another school system or something. So we   ve lost a lot of 4-H  clubs because of attrition.  Is the county fair still alive and well?  Oh yeah. We just got through with the county fair. It   s changed a bit.  Still got livestock, still got more goats now than we   ve ever had before.  (Laughs) But, then the state fair, they take them from here. The winners  here then go to the state fair, which is at Muskogee, Muskogee State  Fair. Then, if they win there, then they go to the Tulsa State Fair. So it   s  a progressive deal, and that has been that way for years and years. We  have had a lot of people go through here.  Are the county agents responsible for coordinating the county fair?  Well, not anymore. For example, did you meet Heather Winn?  Yes.  She   s Extension Director, now. That   s the first time this county   s had a  lady Extension director. Up until then, Roger was the Extension director.  They changed it when I was county agent. It was county agent, and then  they changed it my last years in Extension to Extension Director. And  so, I don   t remember what years that that actually happened, but I finally  ended up retired as Extension Director. Ever since then, it   s always been  a man that   s been an Extension director until this year, Heather. In other  words, it   s turned out to be a management job more. If we   ve got an ag,  it   s Roger Williams. He still takes care of the ag. He was county agent  22  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  for a long time, then he didn   t want any part of it, really. I mean, he  decided that he could take care of the farmers, and he could take care of  all the problems, and the bugs and the trees and all that sort of stuff, and  not be county agent. They   d already changed it to Extension Director,  and so now then, it was more of a bookwork deal. So they gave the job  to Heather. She is currently then Extension Director for Cherokee  County.  Well, that   s a major change.  Yeah. It really is.  Has it been accepted pretty well?  Oh, yeah.  The time has come, huh?  Yes. Absolutely. Here   s a good picture of Cleo Bryan.  Do you remember what your starting salary was way back then?  (Laughs) Well, no, not exactly. Wasn   t very much. But it was better than  what I had, which was little to nothing. No, I didn   t know, I wouldn   t  even want to guess, because it   d probably be wrong.  As much traveling as you did around the county, did they give you  mileage money at that point?  Yeah, we got mileage. Up to a certain extent. They paid you so much  mileage. And I don   t even remember where that ended up. I don   t know  where it is now.  Did you get to participate in national organizations or associations?  Oh yeah. They still have that. I thought a lot of times that I   d probably  go ahead and participate in the Retired County Agents Association. See,  used to, that was our vacation, to go to the National County Agent   s  Association meeting. They   d hold one at a different state each year, and  so we attended all of those up in the northern states. My wife and I, and  Harold Murnan, who   s in many of these pictures here, he was associate  county agent. He was in Pawhuska and he was a well-known and  popular county agent. He and his wife and I, the four of us, would travel  to  those . That was every year. Well, it was in Washington, we   d go to  Pennsylvania, or anywhere it was. We   d go there for the National  County Agents Association meeting, and that was our vacation.  23  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Did a little sightseeing while you were there?  Yeah. A little bit.  Otherwise you had to be here?  Otherwise you didn   t get any. So that   s where they   re kind of figuring it  out. You know, you   re always figuring things, but it was an interesting  life, really.  Well, we should probably back up and say how did you meet your wife  and when?  I met her when I was in school at A M.  So she was at OAMC?  Well, yeah. She didn   t go to school there, but she worked at    Guess  where I found her?  Let   s hear it.  She was a ticket  taker  at the movie show right across from the fire  station. And the prettiest little old thing you ever saw sitting up there in  that thing. I told my buddy, who was  later  my brother-in-law, I said,     She   s got a twin sister.    You couldn   t tell them apart. Identical twins. I  said,    Now, she   s not a ticket taker, but they need to be dated.    And so I  figured a way out to get a date with her and her sister, and there   s where  all the funny stories came in. When he and I were dating those two girls  we couldn   t tell them apart. Oh, man. We   d go in somewhere, we   generally would have  let them sit down first, you know,  but then  we  never could find which one to sit down by. So, we   d go sit down and  they   d find us, they   d sit down by the right one. But we went for months.  We   d go to ballgames, we   d go to dances, and this and that. We never  would know which one to sit by. So that was quite a life we lived, there.  We made a lot of fun out of it.  Had to do some figuring then, too, huh?  Yes, you did. Every part of your life is figuring.  Well, that was smart to sit down first.  That   s right. You figure it out. And so I met her there and we dated, and  then we double dated. Bill and I, and he became a vo ag teacher at  24  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Ramona, and we both worked at Douglas. That was right after I got out  of college. Didn   t have a job, so I worked at Pigskin Davis, and he got a  job at Douglas Aircraft. He got me a job there, then he went to work at  Ramona as vo ag teacher. I said,    Well, this is not good enough here,    so  I finally did my thing. I ended up at Bartlesville, he ended up at Ramona.  We got married. We double dated, and so we went through a lifetime of  confusion and fun just dating and getting ready to get married, and then  we finally had a double wedding.  What year was that?  Over at Stillwater. That was 1953, I think. We got married. He went to  teaching school at Ramona, and I went to work at Douglas Aircraft. And  so that   s where I first started my sports life, because I became a pitcher  of the Douglas Aircraft softball team. If you   re going to get somewhere,  you   ve got to go somewhere. So I did that, and I helped him out with his  vo ag teaching. I   d go up and shear his lambs for him and teach his boys  how to do this. I   d teach his boys because he didn   t know how.  Well, that kept your finger in it, too, for a little while.  Oh yeah. And these girls, they were just like that anyway  motions  crossed fingers . And so we were at each other   s house all the time.  They never got very far apart, being identical twins. They stayed  identical until later on in life. We lost our first baby, and we took their  little girl in, kind of adopted her as much as we could, as much as Lois  would allow us. So we still raised together. As we created a life together,  finally we separated to the point to where they had their life and we had  ours. Louise got cancer and she died with cancer, I lost my first wife  with cancer. Then I found Ruth at church, and she needed some help, so  one step led to another, because she had just lost her husband.  Did some more figuring, then.  Yeah, did some more figuring. (Laughs)  Well, I would think that it might be a little rough on the wife of a county  agent if he   s doing sun up to sunset jobs.  Well, if you let it be. My first wife, Louise, and when my kids were  growing up, I   ve got two, and so they were strong in 4-H. So as they  were growing up, well then we grew them up as good 4-H parents, so we  had an excellent life together. They grew up and graduated from high  school, then Louise died from cancer. Well, from then on, Lois and Bill  were living in Ramona at the time. Bill, he got killed with a chainsaw, so  they   re still living in Ramona. Ruth and I were going to church together  25  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  down here. We were members of the Church of Christ. In fact, Louise  and Lois, the twins, were influential in getting me to go to church and  teaching me how to become a good Church of Christ member, from a  Methodist. They were responsible for that, and ever since then, well then  we   ve been very heavily involved in the Church of Christ. I was an elder  for a good many years here, and life went on. My daughter is an  occupational therapist, and she   s living in Bartlesville. My son graduated  as an ag engineer at OSU.  That was my next question. Did they go there?  And so he   s living in Houston, but they   re building a plant in Tulsa.  He   s done quite well in the oil business as an ag engineer. Then our  family has gone from there. We   ve got grandkids, then I   ve got a  granddaughter physical therapist, and then I   ve got a grandson that is a  pharmacist.  Did the grandchildren attend OSU?  Well, I   ve got one that wanted to. He is OSU born, bred, and bled, but  he never did go to school there. He went to Northeastern, and he kind of  went where it was available. We didn   t get to keep any of them in the  family, but     It   s fun to trace the cowboy genes, the generations that have gone to  OSU.  Well, my daughter, the one that   s an occupational therapist, she is an  OSU  fan , but she didn   t go to school there. She knows all about it,  because all that time, all she heard from me was OSU. She did her  physical therapy training and her occupational training at Tulsa.  Well, they don   t offer those at OSU, so she didn   t have a choice there.  That   s right. She didn   t have a chance. But it was a very interesting life.  Do you want to tell us a couple of the highlights? Any things that pop in  that you remember that are really special times, or fun times? I  understand you were the MC and the standup comedian?  Oh, yeah. Well, see this book right here? It is full of programs. I was a  speaker probably at twenty different kinds of associations.  So you have no trouble standing up in front of people, then?  Oh, all my life it   s been there. And if you look at all these things here,  26  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  these are all my notes. These are my speeches. See, I was known as an  after-dinner speaker. I was very popular. Everybody was coming to get  me for after-dinner speaking and programs.  You must   ve been entertaining, then.  Well, that   s what I did. I did magic.  Oh, you did magic?  Yes. And I   ve got tons and tons of pictures of me doing magic shows.  How did you get into that?  While I was at the fire station. There was a young man there that was  interested in magic, and so he showed me a couple of things that he did.  That interested me to the extent that I made some things. I said,    Let   s  do this.    So I made some props. So in a way, I went through a lot of my  life telling people that I got my education through doing magic, because  I started doing a lot of magic at OSU. Then, when I   d do that, I joined  the Student Entertainers at OSU, and they   d pay me to go to programs,  like the Chamber of Commerce. We   d contract with OSU or A M for a  program. They   d put together a program. Well, I did part of it. I was  always in on it, because I did magic. I did my magic part of the show,  and then I finally got to the point where that over the years, I just did it  on my own. So I   ve got a lot of magic equipment and stuff at home. All  these people that are doing all this magic and stuff, see, they don   t do  nothing that I hadn   t done, or that I don   t know about. I quit doing it  because it kind of quit being fun after twenty years of it. All this is  magic shows programs.  Gives a new meaning to tricks of the trade?  I guess. And so this, these are all my notes here. I   d always start, Alma  and me would tell my gourd story. My gourd story was the fact that  down here at Tailholt, I was also known as the Mayor of Tailholt. Some  of this printed stuff here, it would come out printed. Bob Kennedy, the  Mayor of Tailholt. Tailholt never had a mayor. But nobody had ever  heard of Tailholt anyway, see? But the little community down there had  a post office, used to, and I don   t even know if it   s still there or not. So I  thought,    Well, I   ll become the Mayor of Tailholt.    I   m the self-appointed  Mayor of Tailholt. And so you see that all through the printing  here of programs.    Bob Kennedy, Mayor of Tailholt.    Nobody ever  questioned it.  Nobody asked for verification?  27  Kennedy  Nope. But I   d start every program off, first thing that I   d tell about the  story that I have of Tailholt, that every year we   d have a big ceremony in  Tailholt where everybody in Tailholt would get in a big circle, they   d  build a bonfire, and they   d pass the gourd. As the gourd passed around,  well, then you took a drink out of the gourd. Well then, I went ahead to  tell a little bit of the story about what was in the gourd, you know. Then  to climax it, I said this one time, this particular little petite lady came in  and sat down in the circle. She had no more idea what she was doing  there than a man on the moon. But she was sitting there and the gourd  was coming around, and everybody was taking it, and taking a little sip  out of the gourd.  Well, she was looking, and looking, and she couldn   t figure it out. The  old boy next to her was a chewer and a dipper, and he had tobacco juice  running out of all four corners of his mouth. Here the gourd come and he  handed her the gourd, and he had already drank out of it. She didn   t  want to drink after him. But she looked there and noticed it had a hole in  the end of the gourd. So she took it and turned it around and took a sip  out of that and passed it on. This old boy said,    Boy, I   m sure glad to see  somebody else drink out of a gourd like I do.    (Laughs) So that was my  beginning story, and it kind of went on from there.  I had some stories about stuttering and suits and trains that I used that  were funny stories, and I used people. If it was for the Chamber of  Commerce over at Stilwell, well I   d use important people of the  Chamber, the mayor and all that. I   d find out important people in this  particular place. I don   t know who Roger Tillman was, but I had a story  about stuttering, and Claude Todd, he was head of Stilwell Canning. So  I   d use important people in the community, and I   d attach them to one of  my stories. I had a ton of them, and so that   s what these all here are,  they   re stories.  Showing his book  That one, that corporation, wife, I   ve  got one here for her even. She was the model of a lady   s rummage sale,  and some other things that go with that. Then I had some, these over  here are the tricks I had, hats and pants that I would make. I   d tear paper  and this and I   d develop it into a pair of pants and a hat. I   d have a man  and a woman, I   d have these people up there. I   d tell the story about  them, then I   d do this trick about him. I tell you, people would eat it up  like biscuits and gravy.  Then I had some card tricks and some milk. I had a pitcher there that I   d  fill up with milk, I   d pour it out in a big paper cone, then I   d make it all  disappear. And they couldn   t figure that out. Well, sure they couldn   t  figure it out. It   s something I developed. You don   t develop them to  figure out. But anyway, that made up a program. At the time, that one  was for Stilwell Canning Company, over in Stilwell. I went around  28  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  everywhere. Of course, all the cattlemen, I did programs for them, so  they found out about it. The president of the Cattlemen   s Association  knew about me, so they   d have me come in as a guest speaker. I   ve got  all of those in here  in scrap book .  On the entertainment circuit.  Yes. This right here is for Southern Region Extension Horticulture  Workshop in Tulsa.  Did you get paid for that, or that was just on your own?  No, that was most generally nothing.  Well, you   d get dinner, I guess.  Yes.  And I guess at some point if you needed them, you could call on them.  Oh, yeah.  So it was give and take.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was creating, really, a bank of acquaintances here  that I thought someday I might need to use. See, here   s Horticulture  Club, and all the agronomy students at OSU, I gave a program for them.  National Institute of Farm Safety.  You were constantly busy.  Yeah. I was booked and over booked, and booked and booked again.  See, there   s Lincoln County Cattleman   s Association. The speaker, Bob  Kennedy. And Southwest District 4-H Youth Action Conference. This  was in Lawton. You never did know Frank Baker, did you?  No. So you   ve probably been in all seventy-seven counties at some  point?  Yes.  There was another person at OSU, J. C. Evans? Does that name ring a  bell? I don   t know anything about him.  Oh yeah. He was Extension Director. Top dog. When I went into  Extension, J. C. Evans, I used his name a lot, made fun of him a lot in all  29  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  this sort of stuff, and he never did come down on me for it.  He changed the way something was done, though?  I don   t remember what he changed, but he made a big change in  Extension. I don   t really remember what it was.  It was something about, he took the people out of the county, or the  directors out of the county, something to do with that.  Well, he may have been the one that changed the county agent to the  county directors.  Could be.  It was about his time to do that. Evans made a lot of changes. He came  on board, and boy things changed. That   s kind of like Obama. He did all  right. People got used to him, and he did all right. He was in Extension  for several years.  My note here says that he moved the district directors out of Stillwater.  That   s right. They were all in Stillwater, all the district directors. Then  he moved them out to the district, like to Muskogee, so he moved the  office over in Muskogee. Well it   s still there.  Kind of makes sense, though, doesn   t it?  Yeah. It was a good deal. See, part of his stuff was good. It took a lot of  getting used to, because it was different, change. Change is hard  sometimes.   Looking at photos  That   s Frank Baker, probably, there. See, what this  does too, it allows you to get acquainted with a lot of people in  important positions.  You have to have a lot of people skills, it seems.  Yeah. You develop them.  Or if you don   t, you move on.  (Laughs) That   s right. You do something else. Absolutely. But that   s  what   s fun.  So what led you to retire when you did?  30  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Well, I had some other things in mind to do. I wanted to develop my  pecan grove. North of town I had that farm out there with all that water.  I wanted to grow water hyacinths. I wanted to do things different. I  wanted to grow fish.  Rainbow Trout?  Rainbow Trout, because, you see, I always wanted water. When I grew  up, we didn   t have water. We had to haul water. We either got it out of a  cistern, which was a big tank that we collected from off of the house, or  we had to haul it. We had to haul water for cattle. I   ve got all this water  up here, and I thought,    Man.    A story that you don   t know about yet  that we won   t go into, but I was going to sell bottled water. Well, I was a  little bit late getting it off the ground. I had Larry Reasor, when he was  still alive, the father of Reasor Food Markets, I sat down with him and I  said,    Larry, what about this idea of selling bottled water?       Well,    he  said,    We sell it down there at the store.    To make a long story short, he  showed me things I needed to do, but he didn   t tell me everything, see,  because the things that he didn   t tell me is all the things that kind of put  me out of the water business. That I wasn   t big enough, I didn   t know  how to compete with Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola and all those people. I  didn   t know how to develop markets. I didn   t know how to do these  things, and he did. He was there to guide me, but he died.  So I started developing, and we bottled it for a while, out of my springs.  Then I had a friend in El Reno that had a spring, and he   d bottle water.  So what we did is I developed part of a market, and I would go over to  El Reno and pick up bottles of water and distribute them to the Cherokee  casinos. I sold the first bottle of water that they ever had, I sold it to  them. Furnished water to a number of grocery stores. Then what I was  going to do is develop a unique technique to it, a different twist. I was  going to have their own private labels. I developed an OSU label, and I  bottled, and I had the labels made, and I even bottled some OSU water.  But, I didn   t have it done exactly right. I needed some leadership, I  needed some guidance and distribution. See, you get yourself in a hole  real quick if you can   t get it bottled and get it distributed at the right  place at the right time at the right price. I didn   t get it all put together. So  I got out of business. I just kind of closed out. In fact, I   ve still got cases  of bottled water in my greenhouse out there that I never did do anything  with. It was called Aqua Art. In fact, this is it here. How do you like that  label?  That   s very pretty.  Isn   t that pretty?  31  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  It sure is.  And so, if I would   ve had a little bit more guidance and leadership on  how, because I developed a pad out there to build a plant on to bottle it.  Meantime, my friend in El Reno was bottling it for me, and so I had  developed a pad and all this, but that   s when I found out that Larry, then,  started putting water down in Reasor   s down here, palates of it sitting  down in there, cheaper than I could bottle it, because I didn   t have my  distribution system set up right. So I needed some guidance there that I  didn   t have. I ended up with a pretty bottle. That   s one of the prettiest  bottles that I   ve seen out there on the market anywhere.  It sure is.  I   ve still got a half a dozen cases of bottled water out at the greenhouse  that   s just sitting there bottled up. I don   t know when I   ll do anything  with them. I may never do anything with them. It   s not important. It   s  not hurting anybody. It   s still good water. See, I   ve had people, in fact, I  had the local engineer here who was, at the time, a good friend of mine.  And see, this is what people don   t know and understand. If you find  something, I made good friends with people. They   re good people, and I  needed them as a friend, and I also needed them as help. J. K. Lindsay  was the county engineer. I got acquainted with J. K., and we became  friends, and he helped me to take my water down to Oklahoma City and  get it tested. The guy down there that run the lab at Oklahoma City said,     J. K., that   s the best water we   ve ever tested.    I knew I had good water.  So I did a few things right, but I just wasn   t able to follow up on the  thing the way that it should have been done.  Then finally I got Larry, and we started bottling a little of it, Larry  Reasor. If he had stayed around, we would   ve had Reasor   s Water in  every story in Oklahoma. But, he died. Larry was a good friend of mine.  You make friends where you need them, see. Not that you   re going to  need their help, but they   re good people anyway. So why not associate  yourself around good people? And it   s amazing how that works out.  Networks are a necessity these days.  And so that   s why that little statement there on that rock is so true.    If  you help enough people get what they want, then you   ll get what you  want.    And my whole life, I   ve set my focus around that idea, that  concept. But Larry   s gone, and so I finally decided then after I saw a  palate of water down there in the middle of Reasor   s grocery store. I  checked it out. It was cheaper than I could bottle it out there in my plant.  And I was fixing to pay a million dollars for a plant.  32  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Well, it   s good you went into the store that day.  Yeah. And I told Larry, I said,    I can   t bottle it that cheap.    He said,     Well       Then it wasn   t a week after that Larry died. And I said,    Well,  maybe that   s the way it   s supposed to be.    I don   t know, but anyway.  The pad is still out there at the house, grass growing over it. Didn   t  develop it. What I really did, then, is I developed a greenhouse down  here, put orchids in it. Then, of course, before orchids, I put up a  finishing barn up there for pigs. I finished out hogs up there, and I built a  barn, five hundred at a time.  By finishing, you mean what?  Taking them from weaning age up to 200 lbs.  Oh gosh.  And so taking them to market. I   d buy them at weaning age, move them  in there, and finish them out. And then I   d take them to market. I did that  for a while. Then, I turned the hog house into a greenhouse. This is a  little bit kind of out of character there, because I had the hogs before I  had the orchids. Then I grew them all. I always liked to grow things.  You have a green thumb.  Yeah. That   s really what it amounts to. It   s been a very intriguing life,  and an interesting life that I couldn   t have gotten anywhere else, really.  Except a lot of it is focused on and was based around OSU Extension.  Well, you   ve touched a lot of lives in the process, too.  Yes. That   s the whole key. That   s the key right there. Touching a lot of  lives, because at one time, I knew everybody in the county, and  everybody in the county knew me. Everybody in the county, if they  needed anything, they   d come to me. Well, that   s changed over the last  few years because I   ve had health problems and I   ve had other things  enter into the fact that I can   t walk anymore, I can   t do these things  anymore. So, I just do as little as I can, as much as I can. I can   t help  many people. I can   t do the things I used to do.  The county   s lucky to have had you this long. And it works both ways,  doesn   t it?  Yeah. I think so, but I don   t ever tell anybody that. (Laughter)  33  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  You   re lucky to have it, too. Well, that   s all of my questions. Is there  anything else you want to cover before we shut off?  Well, the minute you leave     You   ll think of something?  I   ll think of a dozen things. I appreciate you coming, I appreciate you  doing what you   re doing, because you   re getting out some things, some  information that otherwise would not have gotten out.  Showing photos   See, this is a 1979 Southern Region Horticulture Workshop, and right in  here somewhere, banquet entertainment is W. W. Bill Keeler, who was  Chief of the Cherokees, and Bob Kennedy. So that   s just part of what it  takes.  Well, we have the one little confession that you lost to a girl, too.  (Laughs) Yes, I did. And that   s the only time that   s ever been confessed.  I   ve never told anyone, and I   ve judged and coached a lot of judging  teams. I was good at that. I made it a point to become good at whatever I  was doing, see, if I could. But I quit playing football because I found out  I couldn   t get as good as Bob Fenimore. I quit a few things, I quit  playing tennis because I wasn   t good at it. You quit and after a while,  you found out you   re pretty good at it, then you get better. That   s the  key there, there   s a jump off. Go from good to better. This has been my  whole life here, is doing the best, what   s that saying, making the best  better?  Yeah, I think that   s     Isn   t that a 4-H pledge? I don   t know.  I think it   s 4-H. Making the best better.  It fits. That   s what we do. Yeah. Absolutely.  Well, I thank you for your time. It   s been very enjoyable.  Well, I have never told all of those stories before.  If you think of more, I can come back.   Looking at photos  Oh, there   s some of my pecan grafting, there, with  some of my farmers. This is Ed Davis, who started Ozark Nursery. I was  very instrumental, incidentally, in many of the nurseries around here.  You ever heard of Greenleaf Nursery? I had a big hand in starting  34  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Greenleaf. It used to be in Muskogee, a little bitty nursery, and they  moved to Tahlequah. Then here I came and helped them do the things  that we did in Greenleaf Nursery. Now it   s the biggest in the world, and  this is Ed Davis. He started Midwestern Nursery, and this is R.B.  French. This is his farm that we grafted pecans on. That was one of the  things. I moved over here and did more than this. Pecan crackers, did  more than anything else is assisted in the pecan production. I helped  these people get started, changed the varieties of their pecans, then I quit  grafting. You know what? They quit grafting. That   s the way it goes.  Although, some of them do it. I   ve still got pecan trees all over this part  of the country that I grafted, but I don   t ever tell anybody any about it.  Here   s Dr. Morgan. I was teaching him. He   s the one that helped start  Midwestern Nursery. He was my doctor. He lived next door to me right  up here. Well, Tom Morgan, and his son own Grand View Nursery, and  that   s where I buy a lot of my stuff from, Charlie Morgan. Here   s a  picture here of Dr. Tom and me looking over a little pecan tree. There   s  Cleo. And a pecan grafting demonstration.  Here   s a turtle race that I started. Turtle race at the Cherokee County  Fair. Watch Bob Kennedy and Wayne Taylor herd up turtles during the  turtle race at Cherokee County Fair.  Where would you get your turtles?  Oh, everybody   d bring them in.  They   d bring their own?  Yeah. They   d bring their own turtles. And you   d look at all the kids  around here. You   re talking about something popular. I mean, that was  very, very popular.  Would it go today if you tried?  They still have it. You don   t have that many people. People have  changed, and turtles are still the same.  They eat tires, huh?  Yeah. And here   s a thing I helped with starting out here was a handle  factory. This guy made handles. Ax handles, hoe handles, hammer  handles. Here   s a picture here of a tree farm, how we made a cash crop  out of his trees and made it into a    He   s still making handles to this  day. Started right here.  35  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  With your help, huh?  Yes. And, well, you look at all these. Here   s a deal that came out in the  Tulsa World where we had a new sudan crop. Had a new variety of  sudan. Well, I helped get it started, but then it was not the popular kind  after five or six years. It dwindled off, but it was a variety of sweet  sudan. This was 1967, and there   s some cattle there that one of my  favorite ranchers and one of our shows. Here   s where Greenleaf Nursery  got started. Here   s some of the people involved when we were kicking  them off. They were a little nursery in Muskogee, and I got them to  move to Cherokee County, because,    You can move up here, and I   ll  help you.    And now then it   s spread over that whole part of the county.  Big. Greenleaf Nursery, one of the biggest nurseries in the whole  southwest part of the United States. So some of those things you can  look back on with a certain amount of pride.  Sure, you had an impact.  You know, had a very strong input. And there   s Bob Kennedy and the  governor. That didn   t make me a nickel. And here   s a drought. See, we  still have drought. It shows you here some of the cracks in the soil in a  municipal golf course. Dry weather effects. This was back in    74.  I guess there were times when you would get, what forty or fifty phone  calls a day? Were there any times where you   d get a ton of calls?  Oh yeah, yeah.  Before cell phones, too.  Yeah, that   s for sure. This was    Bartlesville, 1974, new extension  director is appointed.    Look at that young stud there. (Laughter) And  this was when we had pecan shows. There   s my favorite OSU  horticulturist.  Who was that?  Isn   t that something? Cat Taylor. Glenn Taylor.  They called him Cat?  Yeah. You ever hear of him?  No. Is he still around? Do you know?  Not in Extension, no. I don   t even know he   s still alive or not. Many of  36  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  these people here, they   re gone. I see them go by. This is Bob Kennedy,  OSU Extension Director, Glenn Taylor, OSU Extension horticulturist,  Walter Beckham. He was county agent at one time. In fact, he was  county agent in Washington County when I moved up there. He   s long  gone. Here   s the sixtieth annual meeting of the National County Agents     Association in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Interesting thing about that, I  think I was telling you about the fact that Harold Murnan and his wife  and Louise and I, we took our vacation each year to go to the  convention. Well, that was a pretty good deal because it was in a  different state, like this one is at Milwaukee, Wisconsin.    You ever been  to Milwaukee?       Yeah, I   ve been to Milwaukee     And so we   d do  whatever we could do out of what money we had. But this was like in  1975.  The year you retired. Lots of good memories.  Yeah. There   s Cleo. Look at that.  I would love to have met her. I finally located one of her cookbooks,  Seems like I done it This-a-way. But I can   t find volume one. The first  edition you just can   t find. And it had some neat stuff in it. You two had  fun.  Yeah. She was a good one. I hadn   t even recognized this. The faulty  steel, where it said,    Miss Cynthia Singletree did several acts of magic  and was portrayed by Bob Kennedy of Bartlesville. He was a former  Extension director here and was familiar with most of the crowd.     That   s my picture. (Laughs)  You dressed in costume too, huh?  Occasionally. Very occasional. Quite a life.  Quite a life.  But I have to give my wife, Ruth, credit for keeping all this stuff up, or I  wouldn   t have it.  What will happen to it later? Will your children keep up with it?  Well, I don   t know.  Well, don   t let them throw it away. If they   re going to do that, send it our  way. We   re doing a special collection in our library of whatever we  gather from this project, so down the road.  37  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  I   ve got a grandson     He might be interested in it, sure.  I started teaching him magic forty years ago. He was good at it for a  little bit, then he lost interest. It   s one of those things, you don   t do it  until you   re really ready to do it, until you   re interested in doing it. So I  learned to do it when I was a fireman, because it intrigued me, and I was  interested in it. So not only did I learn to do it, but I learned to extend it  and expand it. See, I   ve got stuff down in my greenhouse that would  baffle you that hasn   t been used for years and years. I really need to do  something with it, but I really don   t have any of my kids that are  interested in it right now to give it to them.  Do you remember how to use most of it?  Oh yeah. I know how to use it all.  Has any of that been recorded? How to use it?  Oh, no.  That   s something to think about too, is to have you use it.  Do a show?  Well, you could do that, or just to show for the recorder.  Yeah, well that would be different.  You think about it. That way at least they would know what the odd  things were and how they use them.  Of course, a lot of it has to be through practice, in other words, and  manipulation.  Right. And illusion, too.  But, there   s a lot of it that   s used that I have. I have a changing bag, for  example, that I use for a lot of things. I can change things from the  American flag into a deck of cards. And those things are done through  manipulation. But anybody can do it if they   ve got the right equipment  to do it with. But then I   ve got some other stuff that you   ve got to    I  used to, when I got good at it, and I told you I started doing magic when  I worked at the fire station at OSU, I would walk through the campus  manipulating coins in my hands. I got to where I could flip those things,  38  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  Kennedy  Finchum  you know, and thimbles. I would use them a lot, see, but it takes a lot of  practice. Most people wouldn   t mess with it. But it interested me, and  this is too small, but if you get the right sized coin     It   ll disappear.  It   ll disappear. Did you see that? You saw it disappear. And so, the  thimbles I used to work in my fingers. I   d have thimbles that fit, and I   d  make them disappear, and appear, disappear, appear here. Well, that  took practice, practice, practice. But I was good at it. And I made myself  be good at it. I could sit down in front of kids or anybody else, you  know, really, take a thimble out of my pocket and make it disappear.  Swallow it. Make it appear. That just amazes people. See, well, I don   t  do that anymore, but if a person really was interested in it, I   d teach  them. I can teach any of them, but nobody comes up to me anymore,     Will you teach me this?    or    Will you teach me that?    So, I figure it   s  going to be a lost art, really. But I have used it to create much interest in  an awful lot of people. You know, to a great deal of enjoyment, really.  And that   s what it   s all about. But I will keep this stuff. I will do that,  because I said, I don   t know what to do with it. Now that   s the best crew  I ever had of people just being people. There   s Charles Lester.  Sue Williams.  Pete Williams. Sue Williams. She was my Extension home agent after  Cleo left. And little Wanda Bowling, she   s my secretary.   Well, we   ll shut off now and look through more. Thanks again for  sharing your story today.   -------  -------
