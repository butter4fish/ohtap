 Little Thunder Okay, my name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is November 23,  2015. I   m interviewing Wendy Ponca for the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Wendy, you   re  Osage, you are a fabric and fashion designer, taught at the Institute of  American Indian art for many years. You   re perhaps best known for  your traditional Osage clothing, but you   re also one of the early  contemporary fashion designers who made the field what it is today.  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Ponca Thank you.  Little Thunder Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Ponca I was born in Odessa, Texas, but I grew up a lot here in Oklahoma and  there, back and forth. Then, when I was a junior in high school, I went  to school at the Institute of American Indian Arts. That was when they  had a high school program there. That   s in Santa Fe, New Mexico. But  my grade school years, junior high and stuff like that, my parents and I,  we moved to a little town in Fort Davis, Texas and we lived at the  McDonald Observatory.  Little Thunder Wow.  Ponca That was a really good experience. There were astronomers from all  over the world  that  come there and observe and use the telescopes. I  think there   s seven domes there with telescopes in them.  Little Thunder What did your dad do for a living?  Ponca My parents are both artists. When we lived at the observatory, they ran  the longhouse which is a facility where the astronomers stayed. It   s just  like a big apartment or dormitory, where the astronomers would stay.  5  They usually would stay for two weeks at a time, observing the stars, or  whatever they were observing.  Little Thunder Brothers or sisters?  Ponca I have one sister. Her name is Felicia, Felicia Ponca. She lives in Santa  Fe. She   s a wedding planner.  Little Thunder Older or younger?  Ponca She   s sixteen years younger than me.  Little Thunder How about your relationship with your grandparents on either side of  the family?  Ponca My mother   s side of the family is Anglo, and they have passed away.  They were really sweet people. Their names were Curly and Ernie Furr.  They were here in Fairfax. My parents met here in Fairfax. My father   s  family were Indian and from here. They were Carl and May Ponca, Carl  Sr. because my dad is Carl Jr. My grandfather was Osage, and my  grandmother was Cherokee. At the time, they didn   t get on the rolls or  anything because at that time   it wasn   t cool to be Indian at that time.   I   m on the Osage rolls.   Little Thunder Right. Did you grow up around the language or the dances, the  traditional Osage dances?  Ponca Uh-huh. I started dancing when I was two. There was always people  speaking Osage around me all my life. So I know a lot of Osage, but it   s  just like I said, I probably know as much Spanish as I do Osage, too.  Little Thunder How about artistic influences? I know that your father was an artist.  Ponca Yes, and my mother. I grew up around art all my life. I love it. I used to,  when I was a little kid, make ceramic little houses and animals out of  clay. I think the first time that I started doing art like what I do now, we  lived in Sausalito, California and we went to a free concert for Country  Joe and the Fish. There was girls there making love beads. I remember  standing   I was even with the table, I was watching them and I told  mom, I said,    I want to do that, I want to make that.    So my mom went  and bought me some beads. I used to string beads up, I think I was  about six years old, and make love beads. It just went from there, doing  all kinds of stuff. I remember I used to make Christmas presents for  people. I   d get a piece of material and then put beads and stuff  on it   and make a little scene and give it away to my relatives for Christmas.  6  Little Thunder You always were drawn to three-dimensional media?  Ponca Yeah, especially beads and pretty, shiny things.  Little Thunder Did you have any other extended family who were artists?  Ponca Oh yeah, I had an aunt on my dad   s side. Her name was Blanche Bear.  She was a quintessential folk artist. She made all kinds of art and  everything. She was really inspirational to me. I used to stay with her a  lot in the summers. She taught me how to crochet and knit, and do stuff  like that. Then, she would send me to this lady here in town, Davey  Watts, and I learned how to finger weave. I learned a lot of these things  that we do here, being around her.  Little Thunder Right. What   s your first memory of seeing Native art?  Ponca Probably the dances. Going out to Grayhorse and dancing. Everything   s  so beautiful and bright and pretty.  Little Thunder How about your first memory of making art? Your very first memory?  Ponca I think my first memory of making art is playing with water colors. I  would really liked that. For my parents to actually let me mess around  with paints was a big deal because it   s so messy, but I really liked that.  Little Thunder You explained that some of your schooling, early schooling, was in  Texas. Do you remember any elementary school experiences with art  that stand out?  Ponca Yes, you know what I remember? I think we probably all did this in  elementary school. Do you remember this time of year, we would make  turkeys out of beans and corn and stuff and glue it on the paper? Do you  remember that? I loved that. I loved gluing things on there to make it a  picture. (Laughter) Is that crazy or what?  Little Thunder How about secondary school or high school? Any outstanding  teachers?  Ponca I took classical piano for ten years, so I think that really helps. Music  helps a lot with everything in life. But I was a cheerleader, so we were  always making signs and things, painting big signs, and doing big signs  for people to run through. I usually did that. That was fun, just with  tempera paint and butcher paper.  Little Thunder You mentioned that music was helpful. In what way was it helpful with  art?  7  Ponca First of all, you become very disciplined because you have to discipline  your time to practice. Also, rhythms. Everything I do is so repetitive.  There   s a lot of rhythms. I have a natural rhythm with my placing of  designs and stuff and that   s, of course, from music. Also just being in  the right side of your brain. I guess that was really developed well  through music. I just love music. It   s fun.  Little Thunder You went to the Institute during high school?  Ponca Uh-huh.  Little Thunder Boarding there?  Ponca Yeah, it was boarding school there on Cerillos Road in Santa Fe. It   s  through the American Indian Arts. At the time, it was junior and senior  year of high school and junior college. I went there and graduated from  high school there. But I didn   t do college. I went away to Kansas City  Art Institute after I graduated from high school there.  Little Thunder At the Institute, what did you focus on?  Ponca In high school?  Little Thunder Yes.  Ponca It was really cool because we got to do all art forms. I did ceramics,  jewelry making, painting. Spent a lot of time doing this fiber arts, but  there they called it traditional techniques. My teacher, her name was  Sandy Wilson. She   s a Creek Indian. She   s a really great artist. Her and  her sisters do Seminole patchwork. They   re really famous for that. She  taught me how to weave on a loom and do Seminole patchwork. Taught  me a lot about traditional pattern making, for clothing, Indian clothing. I  just worked in there all the time. She would let me use the key and work  there at night. I was working in that studio all the time and making  shawls and ribbon shirts, cool things like that, things that you do in high  school.  Little Thunder You right away ended up gravitating toward the fabric?  Ponca I think it was easier for me. I loved jewelry making and everything like  that. But it was harder for me to get access to the facilities, whereas that  studio I could get in and just work all the time. I just wanted to work all  the time.  Little Thunder Who were some of your classmates whose names that we might  recognize?  8  Ponca Darren Vigil graduated with me. He   s a famous painter. I   m trying to  think right now. I know a lot of people that I graduated from high  school with, but some of them have passed away or some of them aren   t  continuing on with their art. There in the college program, Gina was  going to school there at the college program and Rollie Grandbois and  Presley LaFountain. Laverne Goldtooth, she graduated with me. She   s a  real famous jeweler. There was a   (I   m trying to think now) real  famous writer. His name was Hansley Hadley and a guy named Manuel  Dukepoo. He   s a Hopi kachina maker. Let me think of other people.  There is just so many...  Little Thunder Good roster, there. You explained that you got a little bit of background  in finger weaving before you arrived there, then you get this  background in Seminole patchwork, and some more work with fabric.  Then you go to the Institute of   I mean, the Kansas City Art Institute.  Was there a period in between or did you go straight from IAIA to the  Art Institute?  Ponca Straight there.  Little Thunder What were you wanting to achieve there?  Ponca Basically just use the facilities, get my degree, learn what I could from  them. They have a really strong foundation program which is your  freshman year. That was really grueling, but it was good. It was really  good. I learned a lot about photography, and just basic drawing.  Working in the woodshop was scary. We had to do that, but I   m glad I  did that   the sculpture department. Anyway, I really enjoyed working  in the fabrics, fiber arts. That   s where my major was. That   s where I  learned to do silk screen printing on fabrics, which I just absolutely  love. I got to weave on the loom there, too, as well. Silk screen print,  the warp, before you weave it, which I   ve done a lot of. I really enjoy  that, manipulating the warp before you weave the fabric. I really like  that. And then, just being around other artists. It   s such a good  atmosphere because you learn more from the students. You learn from  your instructors, but I think you learn more from your peers as well,  being around different artists.  Little Thunder Did they have you make a portfolio?  Ponca Back then, it wasn   t   they really didn   t. That didn   t start, I don   t think,  until later years. I graduated from there in    82, so that wasn   t really  pushed at the time. I   m glad they do that now for students because it   s  so important. I mean, they encouraged us to take photos of everything.  Slides, back then, was the medium that we used to show our work. So I  did that. I took a lot of slides of my work and stuff like that. Had a little  9  bit of a resume, but they really didn   t encourage that as much as they do  now.  Little Thunder What happened after you graduated from the Kansas City Art Institute?  Ponca I got a job immediately at the Santa Fe Opera in the costume  department. I went out and worked there. I learned a lot from them, too.  It was literally like a sweatshop, but I really enjoyed working there.  You get to hear while you   re sewing, you get to hear the orchestra  practice. That was wonderful.  Little Thunder Were you doing any designing or mostly construction?  Ponca Slave-labor sewing, cutting, and draping, and sewing. It was totally a  sweatshop. I loved it. I learned a lot. But I realized, see, I had originally  wanted to go into making costumes for movies and stuff. After that  experience, I realized I   m not making my way up the ladder. I was on  salary, and after I had put in fourteen-hour -days for all those months, I  was making like ninety cents an hour. So I was,    I think I will just go  on to do my own art.    Live and learn. It was a good experience.  Little Thunder Like you said, then for your fashion design later, you have all this  construction experience?  Ponca Exactly. Exactly. That   s why I was on the job training.  Little Thunder You were already in Santa Fe. What did you do when you left the Santa  Fe Opera?  Ponca Sandy and her husband, Al Wilson, had moved back to Oklahoma, so  there was an opening in her class to teach traditional techniques. I  applied for it and I started teaching beadwork at IAIA. At that time,  they had moved the campus over, they were renting space at College of  Sante Fe campus. I taught there, then, just started building up the  department to where we had from beadwork to sewing. Then I got  looms. We started weaving. I started teaching silk screen printing on  fabric. I developed the whole department to where everybody could do  what they wanted to, if they were producing clothing and/or fiber arts.  We also do felting or stuff like that. I ran that department for seventeen  years. Then I was elected alumni president, so then I worked with the  alumni association and wrote grants and wrote a program there at IAIA.  It was an art therapy department, or class, where the students   we  taught art therapy to the students. We ran programs, like summer school  programs, with the Indian youth of Santa Fe, Denver, and Albuquerque  with their Indian centers. We would do art therapy with the Native kids  10  that would come in there. That was good. I wrote a grant, we got a  Kellogg grant for that because I got my master   s, meanwhile, in art  therapy from the Southwestern College while I was still working at  IAIA and teaching, I got a full ride from American Indian College Fund  to get my master   s degree in art therapy. I said,    I can   t pass this up,    so  I did it.  Little Thunder Now, Southwestern College where?  Ponca In Santa Fe.  Little Thunder Okay, got you.  Ponca I got my master   s degree in art therapy and that was great. I love it. But  I didn   t go on to be a therapist. I worked with children and stuff like  that. I worked with children, but I didn   t want to   I think Native  Americans react to art therapy much better than talk therapy. They   re  less open with speech, but of course, in people   s art, you can   t hide your  psyche. So it was easier and better to work with. I like to work with  kids, doing art and helping them that way.  Little Thunder There must have been some challenges when you   re adding classes.  Basically, you   re trying to create this program that is more expansive in  the areas of fashion and fiber. What are some of the challenges?  Ponca Of course, funding is always a challenge, but not so much because I  started doing fashion shows. We started getting a lot of really good  press. My students and I would do fashion shows around town, and in  Denver, and Albuquerque. We took some field trips out to California,  and did some fashion shows out there. I took them to Paramount and  Warner Brothers Pictures Studios and the Disney departments where  they worked on their costumes and stuff. So we were getting a lot of  good feedback and press. My students were really excelling. It wasn   t  hard to persuade them to,    We need more of these classes.    The  students would sign up for them. If you have x amount of students  signing up for classes, then they have to give those classes for the  students. It evolved itself.  Little Thunder What was one of maybe the highlight early shows? Because you hadn   t  done fashion shows before, I take it?  Ponca Just all over town at different venues in town. We would have them at  museums like Museum of Indian Arts and Cultures, and the IAIA  museum, at the La Fonda or wherever. All over. We did some up in  Denver, for the Denver Art Museum there. We went to Omaha,  Nebraska. Actually the Indians up there, hauled us up there, paid for us  11  to go up there and we did one for them. Out in LA. It just kind of went  out, it was its own thing. It kind of grew on its own. Lloyd New  supported it because he was a designer as well. He was the president of  the school at the time, or the founder of the school. He and I talked a lot  about art and philosophy. He said, and I totally agree with him, he felt  that decorating the body might have been the first form of art, as far as  primitive man is concerned. Painting your body, or decorating your  hair, putting shells or whatever, could have been the very first form of  art. I agree with him. Some people may say cave painting, but I   m in the  camp with Lloyd that that   s the very first form of art.  It   s so natural and easy for Native Americans to produce art that you  wear. It   s a real strong part of our culture. It   s a part of our   in all  tribes   we all are painting our bodies, or taking things from nature, and  decorating ourselves most elaborately. I think it just comes hand-and-hand  with growing up Native American. Even if you grow up in the  city, I see a lot of students there, or people that have been around that  weren   t in touch with their tribes at all, but they still had a strong sense  of identity and sense of symbolism and design that they would utilize  on their bodies, or what they carry around, just on their person. It might  be a genetic memory because if they   re not   people believe in that. I  believe in that because if they   re not raised on the reservation, and all of  a sudden, they pick up a needle and some beads, and automatically,  they   re just doing some fabulous beadwork. You   re like,    Where did  that come from?    Or whatever they do. Whether it   s tattoo designs or  whatever, they seem to excel in it.  Little Thunder That was one of the early elements, I think, you introduced with your  fashion was you were painting tattoos on your models. Can you talk  about that a little? It sounds like maybe     Ponca It was just body painting. I really had gone so far with making the  construction of clothing that I was like,    What   s the other step?    Well,  no materials, or just paint. How can you paint the body to where it   s  copasetic to where you could actually go outside and walk around? A  lot of artist have done that. Body painting (it   s not a new form of art)  but it was something that I used just for my own self to express a  different mode of showing the human body in a beautiful way. I really  like to   I don   t like, I, personally, don   t do shock art. Sometimes I do  art that   s whimsical and crazy. One time, my students and I had a black  plastic trash bag fashion show where we made all these clothes out of  black plastic trash bags. It was great. They loved it. They made all these  traditional clothes out of black plastic trash bags and beaded them.  Well, they painted them. We had it downtown on the Plaza, actually, in  Santa Fe.  12  Little Thunder Oh how fun.  Ponca We tried to experiment with different materials. Just like all Native  people, you utilize what you have, whether it   s bark or stones or leather  or whatever is around you. You take and you utilize it and put it on your  body, use it in a utilitarian way. We experimented a lot with that.  Experimenting with trying different things, seeing if it could be  functional, wearable.  Little Thunder I know one year   we didn   t get a chance to talk about your, I don   t  know if it was a capstone project at IAIA, but you were working with  Osage friendship blankets. I wonder if that was part of it. I wonder if  you could talk first of all, because blankets     Ponca Are you talking about the Pendleton blanket design, the one for  American Indian College Fund?  Little Thunder No.  Ponca With the hands on it?  Little Thunder I thought earlier at IAIA     Ponca Well, they     Little Thunder I thought I read that you produced a show     Ponca Well, they bought a couple of blanket off of me for the museum that had  hands on them and a shawl that had hands on them. Then one that had  beaded horses. They   re just traditional Osage wearing blankets with  ribbon work and then those symbols on them.  Little Thunder Can you talk a little bit about the importance because all the tribes  value blankets, but the connection between the Osage and the blankets  too?  Ponca One of the things that I think our tribe is really famous for is our  wearing blankets. We only wear these special blankets that we make.  We decorate them with ribbons and beads and stuff on trade cloth,  traded from, I   ve heard 1600, 1700, but I don   t know if it was that early,  from traders, that blue cloth with the bands on it, woven bands. It   s 100  percent wool. Anyway, we use that cloth to make these beautiful  wearing blankets that we only wear on Sunday of our dances. Our  dances go on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sunday is  giveaway day. We only play individual people   s songs. Then when you  13  dance to those persons    songs, you honor them by giving away. That is  the only time we wear those blankets.  That   s the difference between us and a lot of other tribes. Everyone  wears shawls and such to dance in, but we only wear these blankets on  this special day. We decorate them very elaborately. It   s time-consuming  work. It   s very hard ribbon work and beadwork. One  blanket I made for my daughter, it took me three years to bead it for her.  I have it in that trunk over there. I   ll show it to you. I think that, as a  tribe, we   re famous for those. Museums have always asked me to make  those, so I have them in different museums around the country and  collectors. At the time, twenty years back, there weren   t too many  people doing those. Now, a lot of Osages have started doing it, which is  good. Getting back into ribbon work and beadwork and finger weaving.  But at the time, there weren   t many of us doing it. That   s the reason  why I got a lot of jobs doing it, because I was one of the few people that  was doing it and I   m, by far, not the best. Trust me. There   s a lot of  other people who do a lot better job at it than I do. But I just happen to  be available. It   s like    Okay, yeah. I   ll make you a blanket.     Little Thunder Why did you leave IAIA?  Ponca To come home. To come back home. My kids were growing up. I was  just tired of paying   the rent   s so high out there. My grandmother was  ill, and my dad was here, taking care of her. So I come home and help  them out and it was a good thing because they both needed help. They  were old and feeble and I just wanted to come home and take care of  them because I was my Dad   s only child, before my sister came. We  have the same mom and dad, but we   re the only two. My sister was out  in Santa Fe working and she had a really good job out there. I told her,     You don   t need to come home. I   ll do it. I   ll come home and take care  of him.    So I did. I   m glad I did. I like living here. We have a lot of  land. We have an old farmhouse, nice house. It was my grandfather   s  original allottee house. My children and I live in there and my husband  and I. We have land all over Osage County. I personally like living in  the country. I prefer it to the city.  Little Thunder You were ready to come home. You did work briefly for the American  Indian theatre Company, I guess, and N ational  I ndian  M onument   I nstitute . Was that after you moved back?  Ponca Yeah.  Little Thunder Immediately? Okay.  14  Ponca I wasn   t really going to work, and then my dad said,    You should  probably take this job.    Moneta Trepp called me up and ask me if I  wanted to write grants for her. I was like,    Okay.    For four years, I  drove back and forth to Tulsa, which is kind of a long commute. It   s a  160 miles a day to write grants for them to help them build that Indian  cultural center. They still haven   t gotten it off the ground. We did a lot  of work. We got the architectural designs. We got a space over there by  the river and everything like that. But I only worked for four years and  then my Dad got really sick, so I had to come back and take care of him  here. They still put on Tulsa Art Festival, Indian Art Festival. They do a  lot of programs for kids and stuff. That   s mainly what I was doing was  writing grants for after school programs and to help the art festival and  then help raise money for the cultural center. That took a lot of money.  We got a  500,000 E conomic  D development  A dministration  grant  for the architectural plans. Altogether, the whole time I was working  there, I only raised 1.2 million in four years. I wasn   t that good of a  fundraiser. They needed  18 million for their project to get off the  ground.  I wish that somebody would help them out and do it because they have  a beautiful space right there on the river, right there on Seventy-First  Street, on the river. It   s on the east side, and they have, I think it   s five  acres or fifteen acres that was given to them by the city. It would be a  beautiful spot for an Indian cultural center, but I don   t know if it will go  or not. I wish it would, though. All the Indians that are here in  Oklahoma, you would think they would have an Indian Cultural Center,  a place where they could have their own museum. Then tourists, it  could be a big tourist draw like Santa Fe, New Mexico. I remember I  saw some statistics in the    90s that the Indian Market alone brings to the  state of New Mexico over  250 million each year, from just the tourist  trade. I tried to explain that to the people in Tulsa. You guys could  make a lot of money off of Indian tourism. All you need is a space. I  think the one in Oklahoma City got off the ground and they built one  there, but the one in Tulsa still hasn   t come to fruition.  Little Thunder Now, when you were taking care of your dad and your grandmother,  were you doing some of your silk screen printing? Did you have time to  do your art part-time?  Ponca I mainly did things that I could do at home like beadwork, beading on  blankets, and making lot of things that I could hold on my lap and take  with me to the hospital, handwork. I was mainly just a twenty-four-hour  nurse, but I did get to do a lot of traditional clothing for my family for  them to dance in. That   s what I did. I didn   t do any really commercial  things at all. My dad   the last year he was alive   I was asked to do the  costumes for the Osage Ballet, which I did do those with my partner,  15  Terry Wann. We did those costumes for the Osage ballet, and they  turned out really great. That ballet is fabulous. I don   t know if you   ve  seen it.  Little Thunder I haven   t seen it, but why don   t you tell us a bit about how they ended  up contacting you, how that project came about?  Ponca Randy Smith, the lady who was producer of it, she   s Osage and she   s  from Pawhuska  Oklahoma . She just called me up and she wanted to  know if I would make these costumes for this. Told me about the ballet,  and I was just blown away. I was like,    This is beautiful.    And played  the music for me that this other man had already done the score for and  who   s also Osage. I was,    Yes, I would be honored to be in on this. I  think this is beautiful and let   s do it.    So we got it together. I mean, it  was a lot of work. It was like working for the opera, but tenfold,  because it was just Terry and I, and we had to make like a 150 costumes  because it was like eight acts, I think, and a cast of forty to fifty people  altogether. We had our work cut out for us. We did it here in this studio,  believe it or not. We got it done.  Little Thunder Is it still touring?  Ponca Yes. In fact, a couple months back, they were up in Philadelphia and  they performed for the Pope when the pope was visiting America.  They   re still going on. They   ve been to Washington DC, the National  Museum of American Indian. I think they have been asked to go to  France next because the Osage have this kinship with the French. We  have a sister city over there at Montauban. They still do it in Tulsa  every year. It   s a yearly thing. And in Bartlesville and Tulsa. I know it  will be continually going on from now and forever, just like the  Nutcracker Suite is done every year. It   s that good. It will continue to  go on.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. What are your principal shows now? I understand  basically you have just gotten back into this full-time for the last how  many years?  Ponca For the last three years. The last three years I have gotten back into it.  Little Thunder Were you still doing Indian Market during this period or different     Ponca I hadn   t done any markets since nineteen   the late    80s. I just     Little Thunder As a student you mean?  16  Ponca No, I didn   t do it as a student. I did it when I had moved back here and I  was teaching at IAIA in the    80s. I did it for five or six years in the    80s.  I can   t remember how many years I did it. It wasn   t a really good venue  for me. In Santa Fe, every year it   s outdoors. In the summer, they have  this rain right in the middle of the day. And we had these open booths,  and it would rain on all my material and buckskins and I   d be trying to  rush into the Portal to keep everything dry. I just show at galleries and  museums and don   t do Indian Market. After I stopped doing Indian  Market, then I was a judge for a few years for the clothing. I stopped  doing it because I really didn   t need it.  It was a lot of extra work that I didn   t need. I did the IFAM  Indigenous  Fine Art Movement  Show this last year   this year, excuse me. What  am I saying? In August, I did IFAM which is during Indian Market  because my daughters wanted to do it. We all got a booth together,  Sarah, Alex, and I and we had a blast. It was fun. Of course, it did rain  one day. I was like,    See?    to the girls.    This is the reason that I don   t  do this.    I still enjoyed it. It was fun and I got to see all my old friends  again, everybody at the school. It   s like a family reunion. I got to trade a  lot of art with people that I wanted some of their art. That   s one of my  favorite things is to trade with other artists. I love doing that. So that  was good.  Little Thunder How fun. One of your daughter s  is a painter, and the other one is?  Ponca The other one   s a painter, sculptor, a jeweler, a photographer     excellent photographer. That   s my oldest daughter, Sarah. She   s  currently going to school at the Institute of American Indian Arts. My  daughter, Alex, has her degree from Kansas City Art Institute. She   s  primarily an oil painter and an excellent sketch artist. She also is a great  writer. Her writing is unbelievable. She   s off the charts. Her intellect     when she had her SAT test out of high school, she was in the ninety-eighth  percentile. Harvard and Yale and all these people were wanting  her to go to school. I was,    Go Alex, go. Be a politician please.    But  no, she was,    No, I want to be an artist.    I should be happy, but    With  your intellect, please go on.    Anyway, she   s doing really, really well.  She   s an excellent writer. She took piano lessons as well. She   s an  excellent pianist. (She   s really, really good.) She writes her own songs.  She plays classical piano. Her father, their father, Sarah and Alex   s  father (he   s passed away now) but he was an artist as well. Played  guitar and mandolin and was a really good artist. He worked with a lot  of agencies and did a lot of    I don   t know if you   re familiar with  Santa Fe Pale Ale   he did the design for their bottling company and  Gruet champagne. He did the soda pop from Santa Fe, Blue Sky Soda.  He did all of that. He was just a really good artist, as well, and  17  musician. Unfortunately, he passed away, though, in    96. But they got a  lot of their talent, of course, from their father. Peter Stock was his name.  Little Thunder Who are some of the galleries that handle your work then?  Ponca Right now? The Peabody museum. I am in the permanent collection at  the Philbrook Museum and the Institute of American Arts Museum,  which now it   s called Museum of Contemporary Indian Art.  Smithsonian, LA County Museum, and I think Denver Art Museum,  I   m trying to think     Little Thunder You never did apply for     Ponca Oh, and Osage Tribal Museum. I can   t forget them. Sorry.  Little Thunder I think you did a show there. We   ll talk about that, too. You never  applied for a research grant at the N ational  M useum of the   A merian  I ndian ?  Ponca Actually, I was an artist in residence there in the    90s.  Little Thunder Oh. Tell us about that.  Ponca I studied all the, everything they had Osage. It was at that George  Gustav Heye collection up there in New York City. I told them I want  to see everything you have that is Osage. Of course, they showed it to  me. But I mainly was focusing on Osage tattoos, and the implements  that are used for that. There   s really not that much written about it. We  don   t do traditional tattoos, anymore, as a tribe because it   s part of our  old religion, and we   ve given that up. We collectively decided at the  turn of the century not to have our traditional religion anymore, so we  don   t have that anymore. But I did a lot research on it, the symbolism  and everything, to try and keep that, at least, the symbols alive for  future generations, historically. So it will be remembered. That   s what I  studied when I was there. Then I went back for   they asked me back to  be one of the people that picks the next group of people that get to be  artists-in-residence. I got to go back and do that, which was fun. That  was in the museum in Washington DC. I got to see all the cool new  museum, which is fabulous, of course. And beautiful, amazing.  Little Thunder Talk to us a little bit about the Peabody Show in Boston. This was very  recent. You just came back.  Ponca In fact, it just opened this weekend. I went up there November 2  through the fifth and put up my pieces. I have four pieces in there on the  mannequins. It   s Mylar designs that I   ve done before in the past and  18  still constantly do because I love them. They   re full length dresses,  strapless dresses that are made out of Mylar. I decorate them with fur,  fox fur, and then paint the body with traditional Osage tattoo designs,  the arms, from here and do really nice elaborate head pieces that  involve using silver, sterling silver, eagle feathers, crystal, of course,  crystals, fresh water pearls, moon stones, silver beads. I incorporate  those into different head pieces because there is so much going on from  here down, it   s so bright and elaborate, if you didn   t have a lot going on  up here, it would be out of balance.  So I make these big elaborate pieces. One of the newer things I have  done, I got ahold of some space shuttle glass, which is really interesting.  It literally makes its own light. It picks up light from anywhere because  they need that, they need that light for reflection on the space shuttle.  When it picks up the light, it   s always different. Each time you turn it,  it   s like a rainbow effect. I used some space shuttle glass beads     and big pieces of it   to make a headpiece that I made for the Peabody  museum. I made another few other headpieces and those worked out  really well. Those are amazing because every time you photograph  them, every time you walk, they change colors. That   s just the  properties of the glass.  Little Thunder How do you find it? Were you just researching online?  Ponca I just ran into this lady who I buy a lot of beads from. She was buying it  and then melting it down and making smaller beads. I was like,    Can I  just buy your stuff? Your big pieces? She was like,    Sure, if that is what  you want.    And I was,    Yeah because I have an idea for this and I need  bigger pieces of it, slabs of it.    I bought everything she had and I  bought the beads she made as well and put it all together. It   s amazing  stuff. I encourage all the beaders out there to check it out. Space shuttle  glass, it   s the new thing I would say, the hip new thing (Laughs) in art  supplies, as far as I   m concerned.  Little Thunder What   s been one of the most important honors and awards that you  have gotten for clothing or contemporary fashion?  Ponca First Place in Creative Design in any category in any Indian Market.  Little Thunder You won that several years in a row, didn   t you?  Ponca Yeah, it was in the    80s, though. I stopped doing that. I can   t even  remember.  Little Thunder How did it feel when you won that award?  19  Ponca Good, I guess. I wish I had gotten Best of Show. But I think being  asked to do a Pendleton blanket design for American Indian College  fund to raise money for them was one of the biggest honors I   ve ever  had in my life. I really enjoyed doing that. I love doing charity work.  I just actually finished a blanket design for a foundation for the Osage  Nation called the Osage Nation Foundation. It   ll be out, I think, in  March. It   s another Pendleton blanket design, limited edition. I like it  just as well as the one that I did for the American Indian College Fund.  I   m very honored to be able to do that. Born up, being Native American  and growing up around Pendletons, we give them away and use them  for everything as clothing, on your bed, drape them over your windows,  give them away, put them on your horse. It   s such an honor to give and  receive Pendletons. That was one of the goals in my life when I was  younger was to do a Pendleton blanket design. Now I   m lucky enough  to have done two, so that   s a big honor.  Little Thunder That is really wonderful. What   s been the hardest thing that you have  ever made?  Ponca Hmm   what do you mean hard? Time-consuming? What do you mean?  I don   t understand what you mean.  Little Thunder You can choose. Maybe in terms of materials that you were working  with or time? Something that was just the most challenging thing you  ever tried     Ponca Finger weaving is very challenging, but I did some pieces once on a  loom, a floor loom where I threaded   . The warp, I used sewing thread,  cotton sewing thread, so it was a 120 threads per inch. I threaded up on  the warp itself, size twelve cut glass beads. I painted the warp, so as I  was weaving it, I   d push the beads up into the design that was painted  on with the weft as it was going. That was one of the nicest pieces that  I   ve done. I only did a couple of those. I don   t have a floor loom now. I  am hoping to buy myself another one and I think that was one of the  most revolutionary pieces that I   m really proud of. I haven   t seen  anybody else do that ever, ever in fiber arts. Because that is hard to do.  You have to set there, and put those little tiny beads like this on that  warp, after you have wound the warp. It was about eight inches wide. A  120 threads per inch. Just threading it up on the loom itself is a task.  Weaving it was actually not so hard. It was fun. But setting up the loom  was the hard part. That won First Place at Indian Market. I don   t think  they even knew what they were looking at. These people bought it off  of me. I probably should have never sold it, but you got to pay the bills.  Little Thunder What   s your favorite thing to work on?  20  Ponca There   s so many things I like to do. I like to silk screen print, but I like  to make paintings that are   I call them assemblages, but they   re like  that piece behind you. They   re multilayers. I build up layers of objects,  multiples of objects, and paint on a big canvas. Some of them have been  really big like five by nine. I used to put six inch Styrofoam inside of a  frame and paint it, then put like glass and nails, and paint, and  porcupine quills, and feathers, and beads, and ribbons, and all kinds of  things. They would be in multiples, and multiple repeating patterns on  top of each other. I really enjoyed doing those. I haven   t done any of  those in a long time, but I did those for a while and had a couple of  shows with those. I think I really enjoy doing that. That   s like almost  immediate gratification. Like silk screen printing, it helps me not go  crazy because sometimes beadwork and ribbon work are so time-consuming,  I just get stressed out, have to do something for immediate,  so I won   t go crazy. My eyes have gotten bad over time. Every time I  go to get cheaters, the prescription gets stronger, and stronger, and  stronger. I guess it   s easier on my eyes to do things like that instead of  just that tiny little beadwork. Even though I enjoy beadwork and it   s  beautiful (I love the end result), it   s hard on my eyes.  Little Thunder When did you open your store here then? Was it the same time three  years?  Ponca Yeah, it had been a bar. This building here had been a bar since 1940s,  and my dad bought it in    96. It was used as a storage space until 2006.  Then we opened it up as a bar again, but we couldn   t make any money  here and Fairfax is such a small town. We closed it down and I cleared  it out and I   ve been using it as a studio. It   s such a nice, big, long space.  The floors are concrete, so if we get the floors dirty, it doesn   t matter if  you drop paint or whatever. Lot of extra room to spread out and work  in. I love it. It   s really functional. We   ve got a porch in the back. It   s  right by the bank and the post office. The location is everything.  Little Thunder It   s a great space.  Ponca Thank you.  Little Thunder What project do you have coming up that you are really excited about?  Ponca This show at the Peabody is going to go to Portland Art Museum in  Portland, Oregon.  Little Thunder Will you go to that?  Ponca Yeah, and set it up there. Then, it   ll come to the Philbrook. Yay   Everybody, my family and friends can go see it at the Philbrook.  21  Little Thunder That   s wonderful.  Ponca And it   ll go from there to Washington DC. One of my goals in life that I  haven   t come to fruition, is I would like to have some pieces, or piece in  the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. I would also like to,  with my Mylar designs that I have done and my models, I would like to  hold a performance piece at the White House, whenever the government  decides to let the public know that they have been in contact with  extraterrestrials. I would like to be like a welcoming committee with my  girls, my models in Mylar pieces as a performance to say,    We know  that you have been here. Thank you for being here and we   re  welcoming you.    Hope it doesn   t turn out bad like the Aztec children  did, Montezuma   s kids when Cortez came and all those little kids  greeted him with flowers and things.  Little Thunder Let   s talk about your process and techniques a little bit more. In terms  of your painting, your silk screen painting, has your palette changed a  lot? You have been doing this since the beginning, too, right?  Ponca Oh no. It   s changed.  Little Thunder Okay. In what ways?  Ponca It   s changed a lot. The palette, as far as colors go, just mixing colors, I  think I gravitated to blending colors more instead of just straight colors.  But then again, sometimes I still do that. When I am printing, I will put  three or four colors on there, not mixed, but then I   ll mix them as I pull  the squeegee across the screen. I enjoy doing that. That   s a way that I  have changed. I use a lot of metallics, and I think I might have done that  in the past, too. Maybe more so now and in the future. I   ve always used  the water-based inks, I don   t like to use the oil-based inks and I   ve  always used natural materials. Cotton, linen, and silk, are the main  materials that I use to print on. I   ve always done that, so that hasn   t  changed. And I do a lot of hand-painting and hand-dying of the  material, too.  That process, that   s a different process, I think, that I   ve started. I put  the material out on the back porch, either silk or linen and whatever I   m  working at. Then I hose it down. Then I sprinkle powdered dyes on  there, colored dyes, and let them bleed into the material. After they   re  dried, I hose it all off, I rinse it off clean. That   s what I have been doing  lately. I got that idea from my friend, Margaret Roach Wheeler. She  was doing that. She showed me some of that that she had done. I was so  impressed that I was like    I want to do that    instead of doing the dip-dye  technique where you get a vat of dye and then dye and do variations  22  of tie-dye. I   m really into that, right now. It   s working out really well. I  really like that effect.  Little Thunder It   s a lot more subtle in a way     Ponca And organic. I really like it. It   s real elegant, I feel. I think it   s nice to  wear that as opposed to the other dip-dye type of things. It   s kind of  flowing. It   s more forgiving on the body. Your eye moves more when  you make clothing out of it.  Little Thunder In terms of supplies, do you shop mostly online or do you go to Tulsa or  Stillwater?  Ponca A little bit of both. For silk screen printing and the dyes and stuff, it   s  all online because they   re not available there. I do a lot of a   wherever  I am at, like Kansas City, wherever I am at, if I find a nice fabric shop  or bead store, whatever, I will go to it and I   ll buy, buy whatever is  available. Osage Nation used to have a gift shop that I used to buy a  bunch of ribbon from there to do ribbon work. Now, I mainly buy stuff  online like that. I order all my broadcloth online and buckskins on line,  too. I order a lot of skins and stuff from Montana. I went up there and  bought some. Canada has really good furs that I get. I order them out of  Canada. They   re cheaper and better quality for the furs.  Little Thunder Do you keep a sketchbook of designs when you     Ponca Oh yeah. Little ones, big ones, I take photographs of things to  remember them if I don   t have something to draw it on.  Little Thunder Do you also keep notes on processes?  Ponca Yes, yes. Just scribble little notes or whatever. I don   t know, a lot of my  art is pretty organic. It   s like the way I cook. Sometimes I don   t  measure things out exactly. Some folks, they measure things out. I just  get a pot and start putting it all together. That   s kind of the way I do my  art, too. It   s not a precise science. A lot of artists are very precise and I  really respect that. I got a lot of flack in college for that, for not having  my finished work look exactly like the drawing that I handed in. When I  would have the critique come along, then the piece was completely  different from the original drawing. One of my teachers really  appreciated that. The other one didn   t. I ended up getting a C out of my  major on my senior year because that   s the way I work. But it didn   t  bother me. I was okay. As long as I graduated. Just get out of here and  start doing it for real.  Little Thunder Is a certain percentage of your work commission work?  23  Ponca Yes, yes.  Little Thunder How big a part is that?  Ponca Probably about half of my work, yeah. People ask me to do stuff all the  time. I just finished making some clothes for this woman who got  married. I   m getting ready to do a vest right now. Years in advance,  people will order stuff because they know my schedule is pretty busy.  Little Thunder A lot of it   s going to people here?  Ponca Yeah, and or sometimes I get commission work for museums, for their  permanent collection. Or just individuals, collectors, people who just  want dance clothes. Sometimes people who just want a piece of my art.  Little Thunder Is that piece behind us, is that yours?  Ponca That is Alex   s, my youngest daughter.  Little Thunder Oh okay.  Ponca My youngest daughter, Alex. That   s a print she did when she was going  to school at the Kansas City Art Institute. I love it. That   s why I put it  up there.  Little Thunder Yeah, that   s really nice. I was just thinking your fabric really lends  itself to that, too. You actually could do triptych paintings.  Ponca That is a good idea.  Little Thunder Have you done any of that?  Ponca No, I guess I could, put them on   I usually just leave them loose, but I  guess I could put them on a frame. I made a contemporary blanket for  the Osage Casino Offices out of    it was one of the felts from one of  their black jack tables. I used it, and I beaded it and put ribbon work and  stuff on it. They bought it to hang up in their offices. We had it mounted  on a frame and then framed. It was huge. It weighed like three hundred  pounds because it was a blanket that has been stretched on, framed like  a blanket. Even though it was made as a blanket, a contemporary  design. I   ve made a few of those. I made a couple of those black jack  table felt blankets before. One was in this show called Art without  Reservation. It was at the   what was it? American Crafts Museum in  New York City. Traveled around.  Little Thunder Right, I remember.  24  Ponca Remember that? That was in that show. I did those a few years back.  Then I did a few pieces where I made blankets with F-14 fighter jets on  them. Appliqued and beaded on there. Those are really cool. Then, I  made a traditional man   s wearing blanket one time with tomahawks and  I think it was machine guns, guns appliqued and beaded on there with a  buffalo head and hatchets and guns. Sometimes I use contemporary  elements in a traditional way, form, because we   re evolving, just like  everybody else. Just because we   re Native American doesn   t mean that  we don   t evolve. I love that new thing that is going on with the  powwow scene with the DayGlo colors. I love that. That   s like a trend,  fashion trend right now that is going on. I don   t know if any collectors  are collecting that, but if they were smart, they would because it   ll  change. It   ll be hip for a few more years then something else comes  along. That   s the way we are as people.  Little Thunder I forgot to ask you about the Osage Museum show. You did a little  fashion show at the tribal museum. What was that like?  Ponca It was great. I loved it. They were really moved. There was people in  the room, crying, they thought it was so beautiful. I was amazed. It  made me want to cry. It was that Cahokia Mounds shoot that I did.  Then they asked me to do that show there at the museum with the Mylar  and the buckskin designs that I did with the people that were like in  traditional clothing, pre-European contact clothing that I made. It was  all buckskin and otter hides and shells, natural paints. I really loved  working on those pieces. It was a challenge, but also it was a relief not  to have to use glass beads or anything like that. I really enjoyed the  natural elements those clothes were made out of. I think the kids really  enjoyed wearing them, too, because they   re so comfortable. Then, of  course for that show, I had a roach made, silver. You know how, Indian  roaches, men   s roaches are usually a porcupine quill and eagle feathers.  I adapted and made a contemporary one out of silver with big rock  crystals going back in it. It set on the head like that. It was like a roach.  The museum bought that from me for their permanent collection  because they have a collection of roaches. So now they have that  contemporary one in the Osage Museum.  Little Thunder That   s very cool.  Ponca Thank you.  Little Thunder Take us through your process from the time you get an idea for a  project.  Ponca Umm   well, usually I think about it. It usually comes to me like at  night or in a dream when I   m laying in bed, thinking about things.  25  Sometimes I   ll sketch it down right quick, write it down. Or I   ll get up  the next day and come in the studio, or go straight to   if I need to buy  materials, go and buy them, and then just start working on it  immediately.  Little Thunder No preparatory sketches, necessarily.  Ponca Sometimes, but usually not. I may need to sketch out the ribbon work or  whatever the   I   ll draw right onto the wool if I am going to bead it.  Sometimes I   ll just do a couple of thumbnail sketches or do a big sketch  if I   m going to do a new silk screen print. Draw it out and just copy it  onto the silk screen from what I have drawn on a piece of sketch paper.  For my Pendleton blankets designs, though, I work in a different  medium. I use colored paper, solid colored paper, and I cut it out, cut  the whole thing out and do it like one quarter size of the blanket, exactly  to scale, but use colored paper and cut the whole design out. It   s easier  for me to do that than painting it. I enjoy doing that.  Little Thunder Interesting. Yeah.  Ponca I   ve done a lot which haven   t been made into blankets, but I have a lot  of those that I   ve done out of cut paper and I just framed them and put  them on the wall.  Little Thunder How about signing your pieces?  Ponca Paintings, I usually just sign Wendy, but     Little Thunder Just Wendy?  Ponca Yeah, Wendy, sometimes Wendy Ponca. Then I   ll put a heart and a star  and date it, of course, a two-dimensional piece like that. But I usually  have some tags that say Ponca Design, a little logo thing. I have some  labels that you put in clothing that I sometimes remember to put in my  fabrics. I do that sometimes, but a lot of times I forget     Little Thunder Right.  Ponca I try to remember to do that. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Looking back on your career so far, what   s been one of the high points?  Ponca Hmm   oh gosh, there   s so many. Well, I was in a show with these  weavers in Santa Fe that went to Mozambique, Africa. I thought that  was kind of cool.  26  Little Thunder What a neat experience. Did you go?  Ponca I didn   t go, but my piece went and got sold over there. Somebody over  there is wearing it. It was a buckskin and hand woven shirt, really cool  thing that I made with otter hide. I thought that was interesting. When I  was twenty-one years old, I went and studied weaving in Greece on the  island of Euboea for the summer and studied architecture in Athens. I  really enjoyed that. I loved that. That was like, I didn   t want to move  back. I wanted to stay there and live there. It   s beautiful there. I think I  went on a trip in 1978 with my dad and the American Association of  Museums and we went to Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. We went  to all these beautiful architectural sites, like Machu Picchu, and Lake  Titicaca, and Tiwanaku, flew across the Nazca Plains in a two-engine  plane.  Got to see all this beautiful art, Incan art and architecture. That was a  learning, great learning experience for me. My parents and I, when I  was younger, too, when we lived around Texas, we traveled a lot in  Mexico. I love watching people there make their art. They make art out  of anything. They can make something out of nothing and I was always  impressed with that. Lots of it, multiples. That, I think, has really  influenced me a lot, making multiples of things. There   s lots of them. I  appreciate that. I like that. I mean, there   s something about that. It   s that  rhythm. Lots of things. What other highlights? Having my kids, all four  of my kids. I had them in Santa Fe at the Indian Hospital there on  Cerillos Road. They   re all healthy and happy and beautiful children.  Let   s see, what else? I can   t     Little Thunder How about maybe a low point, then?  Ponca A low point? Hmm    low point would be   I don   t know. Something  really bad. Death in your family, there can   t be any lower point than  that. A friend of mine committed suicide. That   s really low, good friend  of mine. That   s probably the lowest point in my life, death in the  family. That is the lowest, I would say that. If I   ve ever been without  work or poor, I don   t think that is low. To me, that   s not low. That   s just     work harder and get your act together.    I   m not really into buying fast  cars or anything like that. I   m just happy with having my studio and  being able to work. That   s basically all I need. I don   t feel like I am in  need of anything, lacking anything. There   s no low there. I think if  anything is low, it would be if my children were hurt, or not well, or  something like that   anybody in my family. That   s to me, the low point  in life. But they   re pretty healthy so far, knock on wood. Everybody   s  good     27  Little Thunder Is there anything that we forgot to talk about or you   d like to add before  we look at a couple of examples of your work?  Ponca Hmm   right now I am drawing a blank on different shows I   ve been in.  I   ve been published that I know of about fourteen different books about  Native art. I think that   s really good because in the future, my grandkids  and kids that don   t know me and don   t know me or don   t even know  what I do, they can look it up and they can say,    Wow, that was my  grandma. She did that.    Because it   s just been until recently my kids  didn   t even know that I did this. They had been around it so much they  took it for granted. Now, they can look back and say,    She was a pro at  that. She was a professional. She made a living at that. She wasn   t just  messing around, making our clothes to dance in.    They take that for  granted, they really do. I think that   ll be a good thing. Maybe it will  inspire some kids in the future to do art, do traditional art, or whatever  kind they want to do. If they look back and see that, they can be,    Okay,  I can do that    and get on it.  Little Thunder Well, great. We   re going to take a look at some of your work. All right.  Would you like to tell us about your creation here?  Ponca Yes. This is a piece that I did to show what we might have worn, pre-  European Contact. It   s all made out of hand-tanned buckskin and otter  hide and then, shells and rock, shells and seeds, and bone, and copper  which we actually had, which I saw at the museum there in Cahokia  Mounds where they used copper and they made jewelry and they  decorated things with copper. I had the copper made, cut out, and then I  put it onto the buckskin. Then I made the dress. It   s all made out of  buckskin. These really nice miniature little shells here, abalone shells. I  used a mixture of charcoal and glue to make paint here. This is an otter  hide. The dress goes around like this, in the back, got a tag on there. But  this is the way otter hide comes on here. Like this. It   s a separate piece.  It goes like that.  28  Little Thunder Beautiful.  Ponca I made it where it laces up so it can fit different sizes. You can lace it  tighter or loose. It feels really good on when you wear this buckskin.  It   s so nice and warm. The earliest depictions and drawings and  paintings of contact with Osages, Osage women wore a skirt with no  top, a buckskin skirt. Then they had robes and everything, and tattoos. I  didn   t make it just as a skirt for my model, I went ahead and made it a  strapless dress. Of course, it   s my design, but I was thinking of what we  would   ve worn before we had trade goods, using the symbolism.  There   s a lot of this symbolism like this at the Cahokia mounds. These  hands, they had these exact hand, bone hand in the cases there they  found in the burials. These were worn by men. I forgot to put this on  there. This is a traditional thing that all Osages wore. This is a shell, a  fresh water shell and it   s the color of sunrise. Every morning, Osages  would pray to God at dawn. That   s what that color represents, that  color. Anyway, I really like this piece. I thought it was really elegant  and beautiful.  Little Thunder It is.  Ponca It was with the buckskin, the two  pieces .  Little Thunder Okay, tell us about this dress.  Ponca This is one of my Mylar designs that I   ve done, fox fur and crystal and  freshwater pearls and bones. This is like one of the prototypes for the  show I mentioned, the Peabody. This is what I did off doing that  photoshoot at Cahokia Mounds, of my Star People, as they came down  29  from the stars. I dressed them in Mylar, and had a large train, usually,  the train going back farther in the wind in the photo shoot. You can  make the train as long as you want. It goes back, and it   s just Mylar  which they use in the space shuttles, and great. Anyway, I   ve been  doing this for years and then body paint on the models because it looked  really well, real dramatic and with head pieces. I don   t have any head  pieces here. In the show at Peabody, there   s head pieces that go with it.  But these are, there   s four of these. I   ve had these designs and fashion  shows all over, like Denver Art Museum.  Little Thunder It   s amazingly durable isn   t it?  Ponca Yeah, it   s great. To put it on, I just staple it in the back and use duct  tape. Thank goodness we have that real cool silver duct tape. I make it  like a corset in the back, and it brings it all in nice and tight on the  models. Of course when they   re doing a fashion show, I have slips  underneath because it   s really hot. I mean people wrap themselves in  this to lose weight, so I put a little slip on underneath for them, so they  don   t have to be so uncomfortable. It works really well.  Little Thunder Okay.  Ponca This is a piece   in our tribe we have clans, but we also have divisions.  There   s the Earth People, and the Sky People. The Earth People are  divided into two groups, the Water People, and the Terra Firma, the  Earth People. I   m from the division of the Water People of the Earth  People. I get a lot of inspiration from water, and the word Wahzhazhe  actually means Water people. This is kind of my inspiration with this. I  30  love swimming in the lakes back here in Oklahoma. It   s a piece that   s  inspired by that.  Little Thunder I love the movement on that and those little dragonflies.  Ponca The frogs symbols are actually women.  Little Thunder Oh     Ponca In South America, frogs are fertility symbols, South American Indian  art. It   s all hand-silk-screen-printed and hand-dyed and it   s on silk.   Loud noise  (I   m sorry. I   m getting excited.)  Little Thunder It   s all good. Okay.  Ponca This piece here, it has some water symbols in it, too, but it also has the  hand symbol in there. The hand symbol, actually, the symbol itself is  called the aho ee gah in Osage and what aho ee gah means, what it  translates to in English is    the snare that catches the breath of life.     When you see that hand symbol, it   s like a statement that we   re spirit,  but we   re caught in this physical being. That   s what that represents.  That   s kind of my design of the hand symbol and I like the fish. More  31  water symbols in here.... This is on linen. And then painted. This is a  good one.  Little Thunder How about this piece, Wendy?  Ponca This is the silk. It   s hand dyed and silk screen printed. The symbol that   s  printed on there is the Mayan symbol for  the soul  that they carved, it   s  a glyph that they carve in the temples. I thought it was a really, really  elegant symbol. It works really well with the silver.  Little Thunder It   s just so a beautiful palette, that color.  Ponca I really like it. I think it worked really well.  Little Thunder Well, thank you so much for your time today.  Ponca Thank you. Thank you so much.  -------  -------
