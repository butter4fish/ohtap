 Wilson  Today is December 2, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m joined  today by Dr. Tanya Finchum. We are with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University Library. Today, we are  in Stillwater, Oklahoma, at the home of Dr. Earl Newsom, who we will  be talking with for the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history project. So  thank you for joining us today.  Thank you.  To start out, would you tell us about where you were born and when?  Yes, I was born in Drumright, Oklahoma, which was an oil boom town,  January 9, 1919. I went all through school there, and I carried newspaper  routes most of the time when I was growing up and so forth. I started  writing when I was still a sophomore in high school, both for the high  school paper and for the local newspaper. And that just sort of led me on  to a career in writing.  Were you born in a hospital in Drumright?  No, born in a house there. I don   t think they had hospitals there in an oil  boom town. (Laughs) I don   t think they heard of a hospital. So I was  born, I don   t know what the street address was, but in an oil field shack,  probably.  So was your father working on the oil field?  Yes, he was what they called a tool dresser. I don   t know what that  means. But everybody worked in the oil field, and he did too.  What about your mom? Did she tend to the household?  5  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Yes, she did. And then later they separated, and she took over the family  and took us from there on.  Do you have siblings?  Yes, I have two brothers and two sisters.  Where do you fall in that line?  I   m number four, and I have a younger sister. She   s still living in Del  City, and we talk often. I started working on the student newspaper  while I was in high school, and the journalism teacher owned part  interest in the local newspaper, so he hired me while I was still in high  school to work on the local paper. I   ve been working on newspapers  ever since.  How did you get started writing in high school?  Through the journalism course. They had a student newspaper, and I  started writing for them, covering sports mostly. And it just grew from  there. I just like to write. It was my only talent I guess I ever had maybe.  What was it like growing up in an oil boom town?  Very interesting, wild town. It was never boring. But I enjoyed it, and I  was glad.  Do you know what the early population was?  A headline in the local paper said it had once reached 18,000. And then  as late as the 1930s, the official census was still 5,200. I think all these  oil companies came in and set up refineries, and so most of the  population was involved. And then, in the 1930s, the oil companies  began to move to the East and collaborate and whatnot with each other.  So most of the refineries left Drumright. I guess there aren   t any there  now. I understand the population is about 2,500 or something. I still  have a few friends there. It is still my home town.  Had your father been working in the oil field for a while?  Yes. As I said, he was called a tool dresser, and I don   t have any idea  what that means, but he worked on oil derricks and things.  So was he from Oklahoma?  Yes, he was from Lawton, I think. He came to Drumright as part of the  6  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  oil field operation and was there for a while. Later, he worked at  Blackwell and some other oil towns. But everybody over there was in  the oil field. There were quite a number of large oil companies there, the  Tidewater, the Deep Route, Mid-Continent, City Service. The whole  town was just oil, and I grew up in that atmosphere, which was rather  exciting.  I guess most of your friends, their parents worked in the oil field, too?  Oh, yes, everybody. Everybody except those who were in business, or a  few bootleggers. But it was a good town, and it was a very exciting  town, always lots of activity. People stayed up Saturday night, the  business district, until about midnight. So it was a good place to be.  And was there quite a bit of money?  Oh, yes. I mean, oil companies paid pretty well. We never made a lot of  money, but we always had a living. Very friendly, open town. Not much  society, just everyday oil field workers. A very good place to be. Then,  of course, oil towns also nearby were Shamrock on one side and Oilton  on the other.  Would you do any traveling?  When I was young, you mean?  Yes.  Well, not much. A lot of those days were Depression years, and people  didn   t go around like they do now. But I did some. I visited relatives  here and there and explored oil fields here and there. I started working  on the local newspaper when I was only seventeen and wrote a lot of  stories for them, even when I was young. And I kept working there for  the next four years and became an editor of one of the local weeklies  there when I was still nineteen. That led me to go on to journalism  school, on a scholarship, at Northwestern and at Oklahoma State. I was  born to be a writer, I guess. (Laughter)  So was that your first job, working for the newspaper?  Oh, yes. I started when I was still in high school.  Did you also deliver papers?  Yes, I delivered the Tulsa World and Tulsa Tribune, Drumright Derrick.  I was always doing something. I had to. Those were Depression days,  7  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  and even young kids had to get out and earn a few pennies for  themselves and so forth, and I enjoyed it, too.  Were there any reporters or journalists that you looked up to in your  teenage years?  Well, yes, I had an outstanding journalism teacher in high school. That  was sort of my one that led me into this. He was very good.  What was his name?  Orville von Gulker. He had been to Oklahoma University and studied  journalism there, and he had worked on some newspapers. He taught  journalism at Drumright high school. I was in his journalism class, and  that   s what led me into my career. He was a very good teacher, very  inspirational. And then he later purchased half-interest in the local  weekly, and so when I finished high school he hired me to work on that  weekly paper there. I sort of took a natural course.  What was that weekly paper called?  Drumright Journal.  And does it still exist?  No, none of the papers that were there then exist now. There is only one  paper there called the Drumright Gusher, but it was not part of any of  the others.  What sorts of stories would you cover?  I covered almost every kind. I started out on sports, of course, covered  all the football and basketball games. But later, I was covering the Junior  Chamber of Commerce, City Council, and did a lot of feature stories,  interviewing people about things. I just like to write and liked people. As  a matter of fact, it was about the only talent I had, so I used it to the  utmost. (Laughter) I think I won a state column writing contest when I  was only seventeen.  Wow.  I kept it for a long time.  I bet.  So I guess I had some natural bent that way, and I tried to do the best  8  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  with it.  Did Drumright have a pretty good sports program?  The high school? Yes, oh, yes. They were strong in football and  basketball, things like that. I used to cover all of those games. I also  served as a local correspondent for the Tulsa World while I was doing  that. Yes, that was my life, almost.  Going back a few years earlier, when the Depression hit, how did the oil  boom town atmosphere change?  Well, it slowly declined. The town was once supposedly 18,000. I don   t  know whether it was or not, but that   s what one of the headlines said in  one of the papers. By 1935 it   d gone down to about 5,200. I believe that  was the 1930 census, and then it just began slowly going down since. I  think it   s around 2,500 now. All the oil companies are gone, and all the  oil field people are gone. But it was a wild old town for a long time. It  and Oilton and Shamrock, that whole oilfield area there.  So people just started leaving town when the companies closed up.  Well, they   d go and take their employees with them somewhere, maybe  to Wisconsin, or anywhere. Some went to New Jersey. I think the  Tidewater Company went to New Jersey. Deep Rock combined with  someone, and next thing you know, they were gone.  So did you lose a lot of friends during that time?  Oh, yes, yes. I used to know everybody in town. Now I don   t know but  about three people. But, of course, I   m older and a lot of them are older.  But the oil fields have just disappeared, nothing there. So it   s mostly  people on pensions and that sort of thing. It   s a nice little town to live in,  but the oil boom atmosphere is gone. I   m sure the high school and all  that are different, too.  After the oil companies left, how did your family make a living?  Well, most of the families just left. Some of them were transferred by  the oil companies, if they left. Those who stayed just made a living any  way they could, maybe by working in grocery stores or dry goods stores  or wherever there was an opportunity. And I always seemed to find a job  of some kind, never got rich but we survived through the bad years,  through the Depression years. There used to be maybe six or seven  automobile agencies there, and I don   t think there are any now. Maybe  one, I don   t know. I mean, everything   s gone. It used to be a very  9  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  bustling, hustling atmosphere. A lot of churches there then, it was  always packed. I guess towns just eventually deteriorate after their  industries leave. But it was a very exciting town, very interesting town.  Was there a lot of entertainment?  Yes, they had a city park there with a big stage, and they had programs  regularly down there plus all around town. It was a busy town with lots  of things to do. Of course, everybody went to sporting events at the high  school. I enjoyed them. My early life was always there, but there was no  future there for me. I became editor there for the local weekly when I  was only nineteen. I did pretty well, won a state contest. But there was  not enough business there to continue two newspapers, so this one  finally went out of business.  When did you graduate high school?  1936.  How old were you then?  Seventeen.  So then you went right on to work at the newspaper.  Yes, I was already working there. (Laughs) I started working there when  I was sixteen. I don   t know whether I should have, but I was. I seemed  to have an inclination to write, and I enjoyed it, and they needed help. I  took root there, eventually became editor of that paper.  So when did you leave Drumright?  I think with the war. I think it was World War II.    41 I guess it would be.     41,    42, along there in the early 1940s. I   ve been all over the place since  then. I can   t even remember where all I   ve been.  Did you serve in the war?  Yes, I was in the navy in World War II. After that, the GI Bill passed. I  worked for a while as administrative aid for Congressman Lyle Boren.  He was in Washington. When I was discharged from the navy I decided  I   d go see the Capitol building. I went by his office to see the  congressman, and we visited. When I started to leave he said,    I want  you to go to work for me.    (Laughter) So I said,    Okay, I   m looking for  a job.    And so I became his administrative aid, and I really loved it. But  then the GI Bill passed, and I still didn   t have my degree or education,  10  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  and so I wanted to come back. And I came back to Oklahoma State then.  Did you already know you wanted to come to Oklahoma State?  Yes, pretty well. It was about the only thing I knew anything about, and  I liked everybody I knew over here. I was living in Drumright when I  was in high school. But the teachers over there, some of them were OSU  graduates. I just knew I wanted to come here to OSU, and that   s why I  did. Because of the newspaper experience I had, they let me become a  teacher in the journalism labs while I was going to school. So I became a  journalism teacher even when I was doing my undergraduate work. That  just kind of led me then into academic work. It was almost like a plan or  something.  Just happened how it was supposed to.  Yes, one thing led to another. I had one of my teachers that I taught the  labs for had been to Northwestern, and he suggested that I go there and  get an advanced degree. That worked out. I went up there and got a  master   s. Everything just seemed like it was preordained or something,  but it worked. I received the award at Northwestern as the outstanding  graduate, in my sequence in the master   s level. Then one of the teachers  at Oklahoma State became department head at Texas A M College, and  so as soon as I finished at Northwestern, he called me and wanted me to  come down there. So one thing just seemed to fall into place. I taught at  Texas A M for five years.  Journalism?  Yes. And I liked it down there, too. It was a good place. That was when  it was still all male. Students then, if they had no girlfriends, they were  dedicated to their studies.  They could focus a little easier. (Laughs)  Yes. Everything seemed to fall into place. If I was going to stay in  academic work, I ought to get an advanced degree. So one thing led to  another, and I pursued a doctorate and got that out of the way.  And where did you get that?  I got it at Oklahoma State. I took a Doctorate of Education. I did some  teaching while I was working on the degree.  Was the OSU campus a lot different when you came back for your  graduate degree?  11  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Oh, yes. When I first went there, it was almost like a country school,  small school, small college. And then it was, after the war, beginning to  expand, GI   s coming in. It changed, yes. And now, it   s nothing like it  was then. I mean, it   s sophisticated now. Back then, everyone knew  everyone else, and we were all part of one thing. It was good for me. I  liked that informal atmosphere. And even your teachers, you knew them  personally. It   s not the same anymore, but it   s not the same anywhere. I  understand journalism is getting to be quite a big operation at the  campus out here, and I   m sure they   re doing a good job.  How long did you work for Congressman Boren?  Not very long, maybe a year and a half. And then the GI Bill passed, and  I didn   t have my degree. I really loved working for him. It was so much  fun, and I could   ve stayed, but I knew if I didn   t go back and get that  degree, I never would.  How did you get back to Oklahoma from Washington, D.C.?  How do you mean?  Did you take a train or hitchhike?  Probably either flew or took a train. I did take, once a month, I took a  train back and forth, and I also took planes. I think I flew American  Airlines, I   m not sure. That was an exciting venture, working for him.  He was good to work for. I got to see a lot of big important people and  watch the senate and congress in session. I could   ve stayed there. Then  later, a couple of years later I think, he was defeated. So good thing I  left.  Was your mom still living in Drumright?  She lived there quite a while, and then I can   t remember what year she  came to Stillwater. I think, yes, she was still in Drumright then.  Did she have a college degree?  No. I may be the only one in the family. I believe I was. My father and  mother separated somewhere along the way, and I don   t think any of the  other children really had time to.  When you got to the Oklahoma A M campus, had you been to Stillwater  before you came here on the GI Bill?  12  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Not lived here or anything. I mean, I think I used to hitchhike back and  forth, but I never was a part of it or anything. (Laughter) We never lived  here or never attended school here. But somehow or another I was  attracted to OSU. It was democratic, down to earth, informal, and I like  that from a small town. I doubt if it   s that way anymore, but it was great  to be here. And while I was here, that would   ve been Bob Fenimore, the  greatest  football  player ever here. I was here the same time as him. I  even knew him.  Wow, that was exciting I bet.  Yes. There were others, too, like that. Teacher, Jim Stratton, you  probably never heard of him, but   James C. Stratton. When I came  back, I first worked for the NewsPress part time while I was still going  to school, and he talked me into leaving that and coming out and helping  him with his journalism labs, Jim Stratton did. So as I did that I became  interested in teaching journalism. He and one of the others were from  Northwestern. And they called Northwestern and told them about me. I  thought,    I like that.    So I went up to get a master   s. And then one of  them who I worked with at Oklahoma State took over as department  head of Texas A M. As soon as I finished Northwestern, he called and  wanted me to come down there. My life seemed preordained. So I spent  five years teaching at Texas A M.  Well, when you were at Oklahoma A M, where did you live?  Everybody lived in rooming houses. You either lived in a dorm or rented  your room around town. I lived at 507 South West Street. It was an  economics professor and his wife lived there, and they rented a room in  the front. I stayed there through my college. They were good people, and  I enjoyed it.  Did you eat there also?  No, they used to have a dining hall, or something, out at the college, and  I   d just go out there. There were a lot of us there who were veterans. We  joined together, went there and ate. It was a very informal life, and I  really enjoyed my undergraduate days here.  Do you remember any buildings that you had classes in?  Well, I was trying to think. I don   t remember whether the Student Union  even existed then. Is there a Y-Hut there now? Do you know?  Not now, but there was.  13  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  We usually had coffee there a lot. And coffee also, there was a place on  Knoblock there. It may still be there. There were several places along,  and there was a Comanche Caf   and a Swim   s, campus hangouts. It was  still kind of informal, even then. So it was very pleasant, a very pleasant  time.  Did you ever make it out to the Rock Castle?  Yes, but I can   t remember where it was. (Laughs) Yes, it has kind of  faded from my memory.  Did you ever go to the movies?  Oh, yes. There was the Campus and the Midwest. What was down on     It was down there by Bates Brothers.  The Camera?  Well, there was a Camera on that side. The Camera was there, and there  was one on this side. I can   t remember the name of it. There were three  or four theaters then, and I went to all of them.  Do you remember the first picture show you ever saw?  In my life?  Yes.  No, no I don   t. It would have been over in Drumright, I   m sure.  Probably an old cowboy movie.  Did they have one theater in Drumright or several?  They had the Strand, the Midwest, and the Rex. They had three.  Drumright was a pretty busy town back in those days.  Would you go to many sporting events on     Oh, all of them, just about. Football, basketball, I was a sports fan. I  covered football games for the Tulsa World   Drumright games. I just  did everything I could. I enjoyed writing sports. I won an award for state  column writing. I think I was only seventeen. I don   t even remember  what I wrote about. But it seemed to just be part of a natural history,  writing, from the time I was young.  Who were some professors that had a big influence on you?  14  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Well, I   d say James C. Stratton. He was a journalism professor here, and  he got me involved as his lab assistant. I helped him teach students. It  kind of brought me into deeper involvement in journalism. And there  was another professor named Richard Ide, and he became interested in  me and encouraged me to pursue an advanced degree and even loaned  me some money. (Laughs)  Did he teach journalism?  Yes. He and Stratton were good friends and were both good teachers.  They just seemed interested in me and did everything they could to help  me move along. Ide later went to Florida State to teach, and Jim Stratton  died. I don   t remember what year. They were the ones that probably  influenced me to pursue this academic career instead of newspaper.  Otherwise, my dream was maybe I   d be editor of the NewsPress  someday. I did fill in as editor sometimes, when people were on  vacation.  Did many of your classmates, at that time, stay in the journalism world?  You mean at OSU?  Yes.  I think they did, but I   ve lost track of them. I can   t even remember now  hardly who they were. But, yes, I think all of them. Jim Reynolds, I  remember him. He went to Wall Street Journal. Others did well.  Did you know who Paul Miller was?  Yes, I remember his name, but he was gone when I got here. He had  already left. As a matter of fact, he had a good reputation in the  journalism school here. He left, and I don   t remember whether he was  succeeded by Clement Trout. But then along came Jim Stratton and  Richard Ide. It was a very informal, personal thing then. It wasn   t big, so  it was a really good experience.  Do you remember who the OSU president was at that time?  Bennett. I think Henry Bennett was president from the time I got in until  I finished. I can   t even remember who was before. (Laughs) Who was  here before Bennett? I don   t even know. I   m sure Henry Bennett was  here. Jim Lookabaugh was the football coach. Iba was basketball coach.  Of course, I went to all the games and did sport writing for the  O   Collegian.  15  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  What was the O   Collegian like then? How many people worked there?  Oh, it was very informal. I can   t remember, maybe a dozen. That   s  where I made a lot of friends. We worked together. I remember Wanda  Hinkle, Jim Reynolds.  Would you ever go to any dances or events on campus?  I never went to any dances. I never learned how to dance. (Laughter) I  would have if I   d have known how. But most other campus events I   d go  to, if it was anything reasonable.  Any Allied Arts events?  Yes, I went to those things as they came along. It   s been so long I can   t  remember now what they were or anything. I wrote quite a bit for the  O   Colly while I was in journalism school. Jim Stratton was a journalism  professor and he hired me to be his lab assistant, so I started teaching his  labs and that led me to a fellowship at Northwestern, and here I go, one  thing after another.  Did you do anything with The Redskin?  No, I never was active on The Redskin. I don   t believe I ever did. I knew  the guys who worked there real well. We were friends. But I don   t  believe I ever was really a part of it or anything.  Did you have a car while you were in Stillwater?  I don   t think   not while I was going to school. That was a luxury then. I  definitely didn   t have one.  Did they have a train that went to Drumright from Stillwater?  Well, of course, I moved over here then and lived over on West Street  and lived here in Stillwater after I came home from the war. I guess I  never went back to Drumright to live after the war.  So after you graduated at OAMC, did you go straight on to  Northwestern for your master   s?  Yes, I believe I did. That   s been a long time. Yes, I went to  Northwestern. Then later, I decided to pursue this doctorate. Then I  started to go back and put all that back together again. One of the men  who was teaching journalism here, Donald Burchard, became head of  16  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  the department at Texas A M.  What was his name?  Burchard, B-U-R-C-H-A-R-D. He taught journalism here, and I had a  course or two under him. I might   ve helped him with his labs. But as  soon as I finished Northwestern, he immediately wanted me to come  down there and join him at Texas A M and teach. So one thing seemed  to lead to another. So I did, and I enjoyed it down there, too. That was an  all-male school, then, 7,500 students. About 40,000 or 50,000 now.  Did you attend sporting events when you were working at Texas A M?  Oh, yes. I covered football games and things for the Austin American  and other newspapers and sat in the press box at most games. I was very  active, part time in writing sports for other publications, yes.  And then you came back to Oklahoma A M for your doctorate.  Yes, the pressure was on. If you want to teach, you better get a  doctorate. I   d been down there for five years. I liked it down there, but  they had this program starting at Oklahoma State that offered a  doctorate, and so I decided I better do it. I had a place, relatives here and  everything, so I came back here and did that.  So was that a pretty new program?  I think it was. I took my doctorate in education, and I really learned a lot  about teaching. Dr. Helmer Sorenson was Assistant Dean of Education,  and he was very helpful. He worked out a program for me. While I was  there, I think I recall, I worked for the NewsPress while I was doing the  program. One thing just seemed to lead to another.  So after you finished your doctorate what did you do?  I can   t remember whether I     Is that when you went to the University of Maryland?  I remember I wanted to get out of academic work for a while. I wanted  to kind of just work on newspapers, just get it out of my system. So I  went to Colorado, and while I was there, they had an accident, killed  three staff members of the Lamar, Colorado Daily News. They sent out  an emergency call,    Could anyone come help fill in?    So I said,    Well,  I   m just loose.    (Laughs) So I just went down there and became editor of  the Lamar Daily News.  17  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  And where was that?  Lamar, L-A-M-A-R. It   s kind of on the eastern edge of Colorado. It   s  just across the border there, from Nebraska. (Laughs) But it   s about a  town of 7,000 or 8,000, something like that. So one day I was  vacationing, the next day I was sitting there editing this little newspaper,  but it was fun. (Laughter) I got all that academic out of my system. I  really had fun there. And then, a fellow at the University of Maryland,  he was a native of Oklahoma, and he needed somebody. Somebody told  him about me and he called me while I was at Lamar and offered me the  job at Maryland.  What was his name?  Alfred Crowell, C-R-O-W-E-L-L. The School of Journalism had two  sequences, one in journalism, one in public relations. So I became head  of the journalism sequence in the School of Journalism and taught  journalism there. Gosh, I was there quite a while, good place to be. I  liked it there. They   ve got a good retirement program.  When did you retire from the University of Maryland?  Gosh, I can   t even remember. (Laughter) I   ll think about that for a  minute.  When did you start researching Payne County and Stillwater and  Drumright and all of these areas? Was it while you were still in  Maryland?  Oh, all these things go back so far. I can   t remember when I did the  Drumright books. I did a Drumright book in    85. The Stillwater  histories    I was encouraged to do the Stillwater history by maybe the  NewsPress. I   m not sure. One of them, I think it was the NewsPress that  actually hired me to do the first Stillwater History I did. I   ve got a copy  of the book in there. I   ll have to look at it and see what date that was.  I   ve done so much it   s hard to go back and say when did I do this?  Yes. But do you remember researching Oklahoma while you were living  in Maryland or do you think you came back here and started doing all  that?  I probably just came back here and did it. Of course, growing up here in  the area I knew so much. I   d done the Drumright book in    85, I  remember that. It just seemed like a natural sort of thing. There was a  need for the Stillwater History, I think. The NewsPress encouraged me. I  18  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  think they sponsored my first Stillwater book, Jim Bellatti.  The Bellattis, you said?  Yes, they were in charge of the NewsPress then. Yes, they got me to do  that. They came to me and asked me to do it.  Do you remember how long it took you?  I can   t even remember now what year I did it, but I took quite a while. I  had pretty good background, but I had to do an awfully lot of research.  But because of the NewsPress influence, they helped me get pictures and  information. So I did that one.  Do you remember what some of your main resources were? Did you use  the Sheerar Center or the Stillwater Public Library?  Well, all of those. The Oklahoma Historical Society, the Sheerar. A lot  of going back to old newspaper files, Stillwater NewsPress and others,  just everywhere. I probably put some of that in my book, where I got the  stuff. And then I still knew a lot of old-timers around here, had been  here a long time and who had gathered quite a bit of Stillwater history.  So I had a pretty good foundation for what I did, but I enjoyed it.  Stillwater   s history is about as interesting as anybody   s.  So you went back and made a lot of personal connections with people  you   d known in the past.  Oh, yes. And I went to the Historical Society. Anywhere I had to go, I  went. I dug out old newspaper files of Stillwater, talked to old pioneers  all over. There was still a few old pioneers still hanging around, and I  talked to them at length.  Were they pretty willing to share their memories and their stories?  Oh, yes, yes. There were several who are really still alert and had been  around. Of course, they were anxious to help, too. Everything just  seemed to fit together.  Do you remember some of those people, their names, that you   ?  I need to think a while, but quite a few of them. I remember some, Sid  Miller, Bob Cunningham, others too. I have to just stop and think. But  Sid had been here a long time, and Bob had done a lot of   he   d written  a book or two about Stillwater history, I think. Juliann Shirley was still  around then. Her and I were good friends. There are probably others. I  19  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  have to think a little bit and their names would come to me. I explored  every avenue and every angle, and I enjoyed it.  It sounds fun.  It is. It really is. But it   s hard work when you get down to putting it in  writing and organizing it and getting pictures. One thing just seemed to  lead me to another.  Did you do a lot of that work at your home, or did you have an office?  Where did you compile all this?  Let me see. I   ve had an office here for quite a while, but I don   t  remember. I   ll have to go back and figure what years I did the books. I  had an office at 408 South Main there for quite a while. I can   t  remember what years. I still have the office, but haven   t been able to get  down there for a while.  And then you went on to do a book on Payne County.  Yes.  That seems like it would be even more work.  It was, yes. One thing just seemed to lead to another, and everybody was  saying,    Well, why don   t you do this? Why don   t you do that?    So I did.  I had so much information and knew where to get other  information .  No one else would know without doing a lot of work, and so I tried to  make use of all of it. I just took things on as they came, and everybody  cooperated and was helpful.  Some of the stories I   ve read have been somewhat colorful. (Laughs)  Did anyone have objections to any of this history?  Objections? I can   t think of anything. I never had anyone ask me not to  publish something or anything like that.  Especially getting into Ku Klux Klan history and things like this.  Oh, yes.  I just wondered if you encountered any opposition there.  People were sensitive about it, not sure what they ought to do or say. But  nobody ever protested or asked me not to do something. I did quite a bit  more with the Ku Klux Klan when I was dealing with the Drumright  20  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  history because the Klan there just marched up and down Main Street.  Even when I was a kid I used to watch them.  Wow.  So I mean, it was just half the town belonged to it, I think. I don   t think  it got that much in with Stillwater.  Well, what are some of your favorite stories that you uncovered, that you  learned about? There were so many, but     Yes, I don   t know. I   d have to give that some thought. There were so  many fascinating stories that I could probably think of a lot of them. But  of Stillwater?  Yes.  Oh, I guess going back to the Land Run, itself. There were many  individual stories, but I just can   t bring them up right now.  That   s okay.  I know there were a good many that were quite fascinating. Given a little  time, I could come up with some. I feel like I   ve recorded quite a bit of  history.  I think you have.  In Drumright, Stillwater, Oklahoma     You definitely have.  But I like it, and I like to write.  When you were doing your research, did you take notes by hand?  Yes. Of course, I used a lot of photo stats, you know what I mean, copies  and everything, anything I could do. I   ve still got a lot of files and  things.  So you keep everything in files somewhere?  I think so. I   ve tried to. I think I have most of my research in one place  or another. For instance, Drumright, I have no idea where it is, but it   s  somewhere. (Laughter) Stillwater, sure, I   ve probably got it in the office  down there, maybe. I really don   t know what else to do with that, who to  21  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  leave it to. Times change so rapidly that somebody ought to be recording  it now for future reference, for a future book.  What do you think about all these changes in Stillwater over the years,  how it   s growing and changing?  Well, it once had a real country town flavor. It   s lost all that now,  become almost a small metropolitan area. I liked it like it was. Of  course, all people do that. It was so informal back in the old times. Back  in the    30s and    40s and    50s, Stillwater was kind of small town. I used  to hitchhike over here and visit around. Didn   t have to have all these  suburbs, and Perkins Road and all that. I think it has lost a lot of its  small-town flavor, become more of a small metropolitan area, which  some people probably like. I enjoyed the campus when it was smaller  because I knew so many people from all departments, and professors.  Now, everything is kind of impersonal and big. It   s bound to be that  way.  How do you think the growth of Stillwater effects the other smaller  communities in the county?  Well, I think it   s kind of dominated the county, of course. And I haven   t  been around Yale or Perkins. I don   t know what   s going on there. But  we   ve become a   not exactly a metropolitan area, but we   re more  sophisticated and city-fied than we used to be. You used to know a lot of  people all over town and all over campus. Now, it has grown so big and  has become impersonal. It   s bound to be that way. I don   t necessarily  believe that having a bigger population makes a place any better. It  maybe does to some extent because it brings more businesses and things  like that, conveniences. But when it begins to lose its personal flavor of  people knowing one another and that sort of thing, I think that kind of  takes away some of the enjoyment of the community. People don   t get to  know each other. But that just may be because I   m from a small town.  Well, what is it about Stillwater that brought you back here and that you  still love?  Well, mostly I was looking for a place to retire, and I was kind of  looking more toward the south coast, down around Waco, Texas or  Midland or somewhere down in there. But my mother was still here and  my sister, and I still had a lot of friends in the business district and this,  that, and the other. Mostly my relatives, I think, caused me to come back  here. I knew everybody at the NewsPress. I   d worked there with them  over the years. It was still part of my   kind of like a home town. And  Stillwater is a good town. So other than the climate, I would have liked  to have gone to the coast. (Laughs) But Stillwater is hard to beat.  22  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Did you know you   d be doing so much work in your retirement?  No, I really didn   t, but one thing just seemed to lead to another, and I  just seemed to get caught up. And I enjoyed all of it.  Well, we   re so glad you did get caught up in all that. You   ve provided  wonderful history of our community.  Well, the Bellattis encouraged me to do that first Stillwater History.  They wanted it for the Centennial, I think it was, and so that got me back  started again. It seemed to be one thing after another that seems to lead  me into these things. Of course, I enjoy research, and I enjoy writing,  and I don   t know whether I   ll write another book, but I might. You never  know.  Well, when you returned to Stillwater after you retired, what were some  of your favorite hangouts when you came back?  Well, I   ll have to think a minute. I always have coffee down at Cafe  Bella, but I don   t know the name    Peter Thomas used to     Next to Caravan Bookstore?  Yes, yes, that was sort of my favorite. I don   t know other places like  that. And I can   t remember the name of the place down on Ninth and  Main.  The Boomerang?  Yes. (Laughs) It had a different name, I think, then. But just little  hangouts here and there. I   ve kind of lost touch with the campus,  everything out there. Stillwater is kind of home anymore, so it   s a good  place to be. I wish I could be somewhere where they didn   t have winter.  Yes, me too. (Laughs)  But you can   t have everything. My sister was here for many years after I  came back, and my mother. My sister lives in Oklahoma City now, Del  City. I still have quite a few friends scattered here and there around  Stillwater.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Home, as I say, I always feel like I   m an Oklahoman, where I   ve been.  I   ve been administrative aid in Congress, taught at the University of  23  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Maryland, taught at Texas A M, but always your heart   s still back here  in Oklahoma. I was born to be an Oklahoman. Of course, I like  Drumright, too. Everything I knew there is gone, but I still have a  feeling for it. I might not have ever been happy if I   d have left  Oklahoma for good. I don   t know. It has changed a lot, but it   s still  home. I   d just as soon be in Oklahoma, if anything.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Oh, that I did my best to use my talent to help preserve Oklahoma   s  history and Stillwater   s history and Drumright   s history for the people  that always remember what we once were, at one time, and enjoy  reliving it a little bit. I like the open, friendly greeting that you get in  Oklahoma. I don   t know whether you still get it around anywhere else.  (Laughs) I   ve always been a kind of a down-to-earth, democratic sort of  guy. I grew up poor, mostly, in the oil field. I don   t care much for high-flying  society. I enjoy the openness feeling of being in Oklahoma. I  don   t know whether I would have been satisfied in any other state  permanently or not. I like Texas pretty well. I like Maryland pretty well,  too.  Well, we   re sure grateful for all of your research and effort you   ve put  into preserving some of our history.  Well, I felt like I knew things that no one else might ever know or find  out, and I   d better try to record what I could, even though I was young.  So that   s what I tried to do, especially at Drumright. I knew that was all  disappearing. And I knew all those old towns. From the time I was a  little tiny tot I knew them, and knew them pretty well, too. Aaron  Drumright, and some of the others, Wheeler. I knew them and things  about them that probably no one else would ever know. I thought,    Well,  I better try to get some of that down for history.    So I did. I don   t know  how well I did, but I did it. (Laughs) But my book   s been pretty well  received. I don   t know whether I   ll do anymore or not. I might.  Did you have any lessons that you learned from doing the first book that  helped you with your next book?  Well, yes, each time you do. When you start out you make mistakes, and  you preserve material more carefully, and you learn how to do research.  You gain something each time, and so each book was very helpful. I did  one, I don   t know whether you   ve ever heard of it, Kicking Bird and the  Birth of Oklahoma, the story of a pioneer of Oklahoma. He was a very  distinguished man and did so much to get Oklahoma started. I learned a  lot of my basics doing that book and doing the Drumright books. So  each time I did one, I learned how to avoid mistakes and wasted time  24  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  and organization. But I don   t know, whatever little talent I had, it always  seemed to be that direction. (Laughs)  Do you have other ideas for books that should be written on the area?  Well, I   ve thought about it, but I haven   t crystallized it. I don   t know  whether I   d ever be able to organize anything anymore or have the  strength and will to carry through. But I suspect someday somebody will  do a new history of Stillwater. B.B. Chapman, I guess, did about the  first, and Bob Cunningham did two. The Bellattis got me into this first  Stillwater History I did. And later, I saw so many changes and things  that I thought ought to be recorded, so I did this other one. Who knows,  if I hire somebody else, something will happen here that will change  things, and someone else will have their thoughts. As I say, whatever  talent I had, it seemed to be in this area, so I tried to utilize it the best I  could. I guess time will tell whether I was successful or not.  I think you certainly have been.  Well, I hope so. I haven   t made much money off of any of it, but that   s  not what I did it for. I think I only got paid a little bit for one book,  Stillwater, the one I did for the Bellattis. The rest of it, I did it on my  own. The Drumright book was a pretty good seller.  Do you have a favorite landmark you   ve discovered in Payne County?  Not that I can think of offhand. I might have if I gave it a little thought.  Probably would have, but offhand I just can   t.  What if there was a visitor that had never been to our county before,  what would you tell them to interest them in Payne County?  Well, I would tell them about the Land Run and the struggle we had for  survival, the basics.  Maybe the founding of the OSU campus?  Yes, of course. People seem to be interested in human interest stories,  and so I   d probably tell them something about some of the old pioneers  and what they did to get the town going. Probably a gun fight or two.  (Laughter) I have written so much it   s hard to pin down specific things  anymore. I   ve probably recorded quite a bit of history for one man.  (Laughs)  I think you have. Do you have advice for other people that hope to  record history like you have?  25  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Only if they see a need, something that needs to be preserved, they ought  to do it. There will be a place it will be used sometimes. It might be even  just a thesis or something, but there   s room for   everywhere there is a  place for a book, almost. There   s a book around about Cushing, Yale,  and everybody. Somebody will do another one about Stillwater,  probably. But somebody needs to always be interested in trying to keep  this down for the future, so people can look back and see what was  there.  And how important are those personal connections, getting the story  from the people?  Well, I enjoyed it. It   s fascinating for me to visit with these people, and  they seem interested, too. So it   s been really a pleasure. The more I talk  to them, the more I enjoy it. I   ve talked to people in Drumright, Cushing,  Stillwater, Yale. That   s part of the reason I do it, because I enjoy that,  and looking at their old pictures. Someone needs to do that because there  are a lot of pictures that still need to be preserved. It takes someone that  is interested like that to see that they are. And there are probably still  some old pioneers here that would be good for somebody to interview.  The NewsPress could run some features. But someone has to be  interested in it and have some background, understand. It   s just part of  my natural being I guess, to be curious, and I just started writing when I  was twelve or thirteen and never stopped.  Well, thank goodness. We   re glad. Did you ever write any fiction?  I don   t believe I ever have. I   d probably make it sound like history if I  did. (Laughter) I don   t recall that I ever wrote any. I may have when I  was going to OSU. I wrote some for the humor magazine. I wrote for  them, those were fiction stories. (Laughs)  What inspired you to write your humor book?  Which one?  Hilarious History.  Oh, I just ran across a lot of odd stories along the way and I thought,     Well, I might put them all into one little book.     That   s pretty neat.  Yes, I felt like I uncovered so much that it would be good to preserve it  somehow, and so that   s what I did. I never made a lot of money off of  26  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Finchum  Newsom  Finchum  Newsom  Finchum  Newsom  any of these things.  But you got a lot of satisfaction?  Oh, yes. And I made some money. I can   t remember which book or  what. (Laughs) I think the Drumright book was probably one of my  bestsellers. The first Stillwater book, I think, was pretty good. They   re  still selling the second one.  And it has a new cover, drawn by Jack Allred?  Yes.  That   s neat, too.  Yes. Jack   s a good artist, and he likes to do that, and we work together a  lot. I haven   t seen him for a long time now, but he   s a good artist. As a  matter of fact, I think a couple of those later books are sitting over there  somewhere maybe. I guess I was just born to create, I don   t know.  (Laughter) And I enjoy it. I have a pretty good imagination, I think.  What little meager talent I have, I   ve tried to get the most out of it. I   ve  received several awards as a professor, too. I stuck them on the wall  along here somewhere, or maybe they   re in my office. I felt like I did  not have a lot of talent, but whatever I had, I liked to use all that I could  of it. So I always tried to do that. I was a poor boy. My father, he  abandoned our family when I was a little kid, and so we struggled a lot  growing up. I tried to make the most of everything.  Well, I want to thank you for visiting with us today.  Well, I thought you were just going to come by and say hello or  something. (Laughter) I didn   t know you guys had all of this. Well, I   m  glad you did.  You did quite a bit of research on Oilton?  Oh, yes. I did a lot on Oilton.  It was a rowdy little town, too, wasn   t it?  Oh, it was a wild one. It was a wild one. I   ve got a history of Oilton in  one of my Drumright books. Yes, it was something.  And then Ingalls?  Yes, Ingalls, of course. There   s not much left of Ingalls anymore. I  27  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  haven   t been to Oilton in quite a while. But, yes, it was a really wild one.  And so was Drumright there for a while.  So when you say    wild,    was there a lot of drinking and carousing?  Yes, yes. There was a lot of liquor drinking. There was several of what  they called roadhouses and liquor places around town, and towns stayed  open all night, nearly. (Laughter)  And then people would roll in to work the next morning?  Yes, yes, that   s what it was. I mean, the main street was just jammed  with people, most of them wearing oil field clothes. Very down-to-earth  people. They were very friendly.  What did the kids do for entertainment?  Oh, I don   t know. About what kids do everywhere, I guess. They   d play  sports and the usual activities. There was always a lot going on, all kinds  of organizations, 4-H clubs and everything else. But it was a good place.  I liked growing up there. It was very active all the time. I wished that we  had been more prosperous when I was young, but we weren   t. But I met  lots of good people. I knew Aaron Drumright. The town was named  after him. He had it named for him. He owned a farm on the north side,  and J.W. Fulkerson owned a farm on the south side of Main. So  Drumright won the contest to get named for. (Laughs) It was a good  place to be.  Were you drafted to World War II?  Oh, Lord. No, I think when it came on, I would   ve been but I joined the  navy, because there was some kind of something that I could get ranking  started. So I joined the navy.  And where all did you go with the navy?  Well, I never did go overseas. Around San Diego, here and there. I never  did get into combat, which I   m glad, I guess. At that time, it seemed like  it   d be exciting, but it   s just one of those things you go through. Of  course, the benefit was you had the GI Bill. That opened the door so you  could go to college after the war. But I wish we would never have  another war. I don   t know. Life kind of takes us. We just go along and  follow whatever road takes us, you know. It has taken me many places. I  never dreamed I   d be an administrative agent to a congressman. That  was really fun. I guess David, his son, is still president of OU. He was so  little, I didn   t get to know him when I was working for Lyle. I knew his  28  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  wife real well, Christine.  What was the atmosphere in Washington, D.C. after the war?  Well, actually, it was really kind of friendly. I liked it. Of course, I grew  up in a small town. Being in the nation   s capital all at once, I had no idea  I   d ever be there. But when I was discharged at Norfolk, I thought,     Well, I might as well take one and look at the nation   s capital while I   m  this close.    (Laughter) So I took a bus up there and I said,    While I   m up  here, I might as well go look around the capitol.    So I went in there and  looked around, and I saw Lyle Boren, and he was my congressman.     Well, I   ll just go in,    and there he was, sitting back in his office, didn   t  even have a staff member there. I went back and introduced myself. We  talked for a while, and I started to leave. About the time I got over there,  he said,    Wait a minute. I want you to go to work for me.    (Laughs) Can  you imagine?  No   I didn   t even have a job.  That is too perfect.  It was almost just like fate. I really liked him, and we had a good time.  But, I mean, just out of nowhere, your congressman offers you to be his  aide. (Laughter) But I had worked on the Drumright paper, and he may  have known me a little bit through that, but I never even talked to him  about working for him or anything. Just as I was leaving he says,    I want  you to go to work for me.    (Laughs) Boy, that made me feel good, and  so I did. I got me a room just next to the House office building. I really  liked the job, but I knew if I didn   t go back to school, if I fooled around I  wouldn   t ever go back.  You were smart.  Well, I think I made the right decision. And I campaigned for him even  after I left him. We remained friends until he died. I liked him. I really  did. It wasn   t just a job. I mean, I cared for him. And he did for me too, I  think. We have some breaks in life. That was one of them. Although, I  never have gotten acquainted with David. He was just a little baby. I  don   t think I   ve ever   I may have met him when he was a little kid or  something, but I don   t really know him. Lyle died some years ago.  Christine, his wife, probably passed on, but I just lost touch with the  family.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to talk about, about Stillwater  29  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  Newsom  Wilson  history or Payne County or your experiences researching it?  Well, I don   t know what I   m going to get involved in. So much has been  done on Stillwater, I thought about letting time go by and let someone  else pick up the story. After changing so quickly, there   ll be another  history due sometime soon. I think I   ve pretty well saturated Drumright.  So I don   t know, but all I know to do is write.  Do you still write much, just in general?  Well, I still have an office downtown with a computer and everything. I  haven   t been able to get in there, but I   d like to do something. I need to  get where I can drive again and do research and interview people. I  probably will. That   s all I know to do almost, either write or teach. I   ve  received several awards as a teacher, too. So I tried to do my best at  whatever I undertook. I started as a real poor boy, living in a shack at  Drumright. I tried to make the most of what I had. Whether I have or  not, I don   t know.  Well, you   ve touched the lives of your students and then everyone who is  interested at all in Stillwater history, Payne County, Drumright. We  really appreciate it.  Yes, well, I tried. I started out with nothing and tried to do something. I  hope I did. I did my best, anyway.  Well, thank you.  -------  -------
