 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is May 4, 2011, and  I   m at the Chickasaw Nation Communications headquarters,  interviewing artist Jeanie Barbour. Jeannie, you   re currently the  Creative Director of Communications with Chickasaw Nation, but  you   re also a well-established graphic artist whose work has received  many honors and awards over the years. Where were you born, and  where did you grow up?  I was born in McKinney, Texas, and early on, my family moved to Los  Angeles, California. So, I actually grew up and spent most of my  younger years in Los Angeles. But in high school, our family moved  back to Oklahoma. So, from high school, all the way through college  and my adult life, I have spent here in Oklahoma.  What did your folks do for a living?  Well, my father, my biological father, is a metal artist. He works in  metal, and he likes to make jewelry. But he spent most of his life  working either for ring companies or for medallion companies, and he  was a designer. My mother is a retired nurse. Of course, she loves the  arts as well and dabbles a little bit in drawing and painting herself.  Looks like you inherited talent from both sides. Are both sides of your  family Chickasaw?  No, just my father   s side. Yes, as far as the Chickasaw side, we have  many, many artists on that side of the family. In fact, my great-uncle is  Clayburn Straughn, who was a sculptor and also a very excellent  illustrator. He illustrated for The Journal Record and some other  newspapers and magazines.  Did you have much contact with either set of grandparents, or was that  5  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  more after you moved back to Oklahoma?  As far as the Chickasaw side, it was more after I moved back to  Oklahoma. My mother   s side, a lot of her family is in California, which  is the primary reason why we moved there. So, I had a lot of contact  growing up with her side of the family, the non-Indian side. But I always  kept in contact with my granny, who was my great- grandmother. She  was an original enrollee for the tribe. And also, my grandmother, her  name was Lillian.  What are your earliest memories of doing art?  I can   t remember a time when I wasn   t drawing or painting or doing  something. I think the earliest piece of artwork that was saved by my  family, I was four years old. I attempted to draw my little brother after  he was born. Of course, he   s, like, enormous and my mom is like this  little person. (Laughter) There   s some sort of psychological thing there,  I   m sure. But anyway, he was probably my first portrait. It   s still in the  family, that drawing. I was four.  In elementary or primary school and secondary school, were you able to  take art classes? Did they offer art classes?  Yes. The Los Angeles school system had a tremendous program for arts  and music and dance and that sort of thing. So, I felt very fortunate to  grow up getting to take art classes in the public school systems. Also, I  participated in different clubs, especially in Junior High where I got to  paint and draw. I remember having the opportunity to work with the  folks that created puppets with Jim Henson, and that was a lot of fun. I  enjoyed that immensely. For a seventh grader, that was terrific.  (Laughs) You   ve mentioned some of your extended family members who  were artists. When did you see your first piece of Indian art, your first  Indian painting?  When I was a kid, in different   I guess you would call them trips, that  the school would take to museums in Los Angeles. Of course, once  again, there are a lot of really wonderful museums to go see. I think my  first piece of Indian art was a painting that I saw in a museum. Of  course, they were Mission Indians, and I had always grown up knowing  that I had Indian blood. My mom made sure that I understood the history  and the connections that I had with the Chickasaw Nation. My sister and  I always knew that that was a very special part of who we were.  So, she encouraged your exploring that. Did you happen to go to any  Indian doings out in L.A.?  6  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  No, no. I do remember   and this is very odd   but I do remember going  to a car dealership one time because we were looking for a new car. It  was on the weekend. They were having some big celebration, and they  had a Fancy Dancer there. This was the first Fancy Dancer I had ever  seen and I was just fascinated, just fascinated. I probably was in the fifth  grade. I just couldn   t take my eyes off of him. (Laughter) I thought it  was fabulous. That was probably the first time I actually got to see  somebody in regalia, and it was very, very exciting for me.  So, in high school, you   re taking art classes. Did you have a particularly  outstanding teacher at that level that really encouraged you?  Yes. By then I had moved to Oklahoma, and I attended Wilson High  School, which is a really small town near Ardmore. That   s actually  where a lot of my family is located. And I remember Mrs. Kanega, she  was my art teacher. Loved her, just absolutely loved her. I don   t know if  she   s still teaching, and I haven   t heard from her since I graduated from  high school many eons ago. But she encouraged us in one of our projects  to do portrait illustrations, in stippling, of family members. I chose to do  one of a really old photograph of my grandmother, back when she was  going to Wilson High School as a young teenager. And I just loved that  project. I used to have that piece of art, but I   ve lost it in one of my  many moves.  When did you sell your first piece of artwork?  Let me think. It was probably after college. I sold my first piece of  artwork at an art show. It was a local art show in Ardmore and  somebody expressed an interest in it. It wasn   t a piece of Indian art. I  had illustrated a car, an old antique car, and this gentleman liked it, and  he bought it. I was so excited because now I was professional   (Laughter)  Do you remember the price?  Sixty-five dollars, something like that.  That   s pretty good in those days. (Laughter)You got an associate   s  degree in Fine Art from Murray State College. How did your classes  there help prepare you for your career?  When I first started at Murray, I didn   t know the first thing about what I  was doing. I had always loved art, and I painted, and was sort of self-taught,  except for the art that I did and the instruction I got in the public  school systems. But, really, I didn   t know what I was doing. I had  7  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  stretched this enormous canvas and painted a giant fish. And my  painting instructor was very kind in critiquing me. (Laughter) He  showed me mercy. But at the end of all things, it was suggested that  perhaps I should gesso over that and start again. His name was Mr.  Milligan, and I owe a lot of gratitude, and I have a lot of respect for that  man because he took this novice person who didn   t know the first thing  about what they were doing, who wanted to make a career of it, and  really showed me the avenues to take in order to try and make a career  of doing artwork. They always talk about starving artists, and he was  always very honest,    It   s going to be a rough road.    But he helped me a  great deal in my first attempts at trying to become a professional at it.  So, you knew from pretty early on, even at Murray, that you wanted to  be an artist.  Yes, yes I did. I knew since grade school that   s really all I wanted to do.  Now, I was interested in writing, but I really thought I was better at art,  so that   s what I concentrated on.  You went to OSU after Murray State College, and you got a BFA in  graphic design and three dimensional design. Can you explain three-dimensional  design?  Well, I just had a knack for it for some reason. It was sculpture, actually,  and it was modern sculpture. Of course, my uncle did very realistic  pieces when he was alive, sculpture, bronze sculpture, representing  Indian people. I had taken a class   and I   m sorry, I don   t remember the  name of the professor right off the bat   but he really sparked my  interest in modern art and sculpture. I participated in a group art project  in his class in which we took objects, normal everyday objects, and took  them out of what their normal reality would be, and put them somewhere  else. And my object was a giant role of Charmin    bathroom tissue. I  made it into a costume, and we walked around campus and videotaped  me. (Laughter) I   ve got that videotape somewhere. We just did some  crazy things, so the three-dimensional design was fantastic. I loved it.  Never thought that that would be something that I would be interested  in. But, of course, painting and drawing was really  my  first love, and  my painting teacher at that time was Marty Avrett, just love him to  death. He was always concerned with your artistic integrity. That  seemed to be the speech I would get a lot. (Laughter)  Were you doing any Indian subject matter at all at OSU or not yet?  Very little. Not really. My uncle was encouraging me to get into it, but  most of what I was doing at that time   I was very intrigued with  photorealism and doing objects and portraits of people I knew. That   s  8  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  basically what I was doing at college. I didn   t really get into Native  American art until later on, when I got the job here at Chickasaw Nation.  That was twenty-one years ago.  I  really felt like if I was going to  represent the tribe, I really needed to do a lot more study and talk to  some of the tribal elders. That was actually a suggestion that Benjamin  Harjo gave me at an art show once. He looked at some of my art   he  was kind enough to look at some of my art and critique for me   and he  said,    You need to talk to your elders. You need to really study some of  the traditions and start representing your people.    That   s really how that  started. And that was like twenty-some odd years ago.  So, in the early   are we at the    90s at this point?  Yes, late    80s, early    90s.  I think a lot of Indian artists had a struggle with wanting to represent  their own tribes, but feeling like there wasn   t really a market for that if  they were one of the Five Tribes. When you started doing Indian images,  were you doing some Plains images?  Yes. Started out with going and photographing at different pow-wows     dancers who would allow me to do it. I would ask first. And doing  regalia and really trying to represent them as best I could, not knowing  what their culture was. Ben Harjo liked what I was doing, but felt like I  should really concentrate on my own tribe. It had never occurred to me,  and I thought,    You know, I do need to do that     Of course,  Southeastern art really wasn   t being done at that time. Nobody was out  there representing Mississippian period symbolism or going to stomp  dance and trying to do that in a big way.  And in the beginning, when I first came to the tribe, it was difficult to  talk to different folks. It wasn   t until maybe four or five years down the  line when people felt comfortable with telling you things about certain  cultural aspects of the tribe, about stomp dance, about the songs and  some of the oral traditions that I began to really see,    Hey, there   s just  such a rich and interesting culture that we have.    My mom told me all  that she could when I was growing up, but she was non-Indian. Most of  what I have learned has come from the last twenty years or so, talking to  tribal elders that have shown an appreciation for what I   m trying to do  and for the artwork that I   ve done.  They  have been really helpful     and attending stomp dance, and participating in that to a certain degree. I  know it   s a lifetime commitment if you really are doing stomp dance,  but they   ve been kind enough to let me socialize with them, our stomp  dancers. (Laughter) They   ve taught me a great deal as well.  When you were doing booth shows, who were some of the artists that  9  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  you admired?  Well, of course, Benjamin Harjo, love his stuff. Mike Larsen, I   ve  known Mike a long, long time. Back when Doc Tate was still alive, I  loved talking to him. He and his wife were just wonderful, and she was  Chickasaw. I enjoyed Mavis Doering. Would sit and talk to her about  basket weaving and all of the wonderful things that she could put  together that I just was at a loss trying to do myself. I felt very honored  when she gave me a little honeysuckle basket that she had made once.  Of course, Dorothy Sullivan, absolutely love her work. It   s kind of  similar to what I do as far as the women and family themes, that sort of  thing. Don Nieto, I believe he   s from Santo Domingo, Pueblo, love his  jewelry. He came to one of our festivals once because he was curious  about what we did here. (Laughs) He brought his jewelry and was very  well received.  Then a Chickasaw artist, Joanna Underwood. Does fabulous pottery,  she   s an incredible artist. Of course, Gene Williams   he   s no longer  with us   but he   s another Chickasaw artist. I had a lot of respect for his  artwork because he represented little-known cultural traditions and  beliefs that, to the untrained eye, when I first would look, it was like  from another world. But after so many years when you learn some of  these things and they   re shared with you, suddenly it all makes sense,  the paintings that he did. Just wonderful, wonderful pieces about the  Tree of Life and the old Mississippian beliefs systems for how you  belong in the universe and that sort of thing. We have a few of his  paintings in our Council House Museum, and I could stare at those for  hours. His work was fabulous.  Approximately how many booth shows were you doing a year when you  first got your feet wet?  Well, there   s like a season. We would start out   my mom did a lot of  traveling with me. And then after Micah came along, he was sort of  forced to come along as well. (Laughter) We sat him up under the booth,  and he   d have all his toys and whatever. He kept himself entertained.  But when I was doing that, we would start off in May, June. Red Earth  would kind of be the kick-off and then go all the way through until  October. That   s pretty much where I would cut it off, in October.  Did you go out of state quite a bit?  Sometimes. Would go to the Dallas market, went to Ashville once, but  mainly here, in Oklahoma.  Women artists often have different challenges as professional artists  10  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  than men. Were there some special challenges that you faced as a  woman artist?  Well, I   m single and had a child. (Laughs) And of course, you have to  haul your stuff. Some of it was really heavy, the panels that I used to put  up, the panels and the lighting and all of that. I would just have to figure  out how I was going to get it there because at that time, I had a car. I got  a little Honda, and somehow, I got it all crammed in there, along with  the baby stuff and my mom, and we   d be off  As far as challenges  having to do with artwork being accepted, I really didn   t have any issues  that way. People were very accepting of the kind of artwork that I was  doing. And I was able to sell art. At the time, though, if you wanted to  make money at a show, you needed to win the competitions.  I wanted to ask you, yes, what was an important award that you won?  I did really well at Red Earth the first couple of years that I was there.  Won in the Graphics Division. I did really well at Bartlesville, did well  at Dallas Market as well. Once you   ve made your expenses for the trip,  everything else was gravy. If you sold a piece, oh, wow, that was great   Didn   t make a whole lot of money   or at least I didn   t on the show  circuit. The money came when people started asking me to do  commission work. That   s when I could actually make money without a  whole lot of expense up front, so to speak. So, that   s what I   ve been  doing, really, for the past ten years is mainly commission work. I  haven   t done a show in a long time because with the work I do here with  the tribe, I don   t have a whole lot of time to build up an inventory. And  you really have to have an inventory in order to go and set up a booth.  I   ll finish a commission piece and I   ve got another one waiting. So,  that   s really where the inventory is going. It   s pretty much sold before  it   s finished, and I prefer it that way. (Laughter)  So, basically, the importance of awards is that you   re getting these  people requesting commissions?  I think it got my name out there. Collectors, I would say, liked the idea  that there was an award attached to a piece of the artwork, but for the  most part, they were looking for a certain thing. They had certain tastes  in artwork. I find that they want warriors or they want something that  represents objects, like a still life. Different people like different things.  The people that buy my stuff are looking for the kind of thing that I  represent, which is usually women, children, and family-type themes.  Before you came to work for the tribe, you worked for a couple of  companies as a graphic designer. What did you do for them, and how  did those skills carry over into your art?  11  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Well, I worked freelance first and came in contact with a lot of different  advertising agencies in Oklahoma City. Probably my first job, though,  was working for Award Design Medals. My father got me that job. He  was working in the drafting department, and I was straight out of college  and needed and wanted an art job. So, I was put in the art department,  designing medallions and belt buckles. I see these belt buckles even  today, walking around, on men, these big cowboy belt buckles. That was  really my first job. After that, I decided to jump out there and see if I  could get into the advertising field and do some illustration for different  clients. I was able to introduce myself to some agencies in the Oklahoma  City area. One of the agencies was Marcom, Incorporated   they hired  me to do a lot of stuff for car advertising   Scholtzsky   s Sandwich  Shops, a mall in Norman, the Sooner Fashion Mall   they were one of  my clients.  Were you doing visuals or were you doing text or both?  I was doing ads. I would illustrate, like a Schlotzsky   s Sandwich and  then built the ad. For the car dealerships, they always had their own clip  art and stuff. This was back in the days when you had the wax machine,  and clip art was actually clip art. You clipped it out and stuck it through  the waxer, and then you set it into your ad. So, I did a lot of junk mail  pieces that would hang on doors and be sent through the mail, that sort  of thing. (Laughs) That was my beginning in the advertising world. And  through that job   I worked there for four years   through that job, I met  the folks here at Chickasaw Nation, who were in need of a brochure, an  economic development brochure, that they were going to take to  Germany and Japan.  They were going go to on a trip with Bellmon, I think it was. Governor  Bellmon was doing some sort of trip for economic development for the  state of Oklahoma. The tribe had unique economic development  capabilities, being a sovereign nation, so through this agency, we put  together a really nice piece, and that was my introduction. And the tribe  wanted to work with us because I was Chickasaw and this was an  opportunity for them to work with a Chickasaw artist. So, from that, I  was offered a position here. It seems like forever ago, but I was offered a  position in their marketing  department , which was very small. At that  time we had 250 employees here. Everybody knew everybody else.  Now, we   ve got well over 10,000 employees working for the tribe. But  that   s how it started out. They offered me a job if I would move to Ada  and do the same thing for them, except working for them, not working  with the agency so much. So, that   s what I did, and I   ve enjoyed every  minute of it.  12  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Working in the same place as your dad, that must have been kind of  nice, too, because you hadn   t had that much contact growing up.  It really was. We got to know each other during that time, and I grew to  appreciate his talent. He had a marvelous talent for three-dimensional,  fine jewelry pieces. That   s what he did in his off-time. Of course, on the  job, he was like me. He was constructing belt buckles and medallions  and that sort of thing. But in his off-time, he did some beautiful jewelry.  Was it Indian jewelry or contemporary jewelry?  It was contemporary jewelry. He would set stones and that sort of thing,  and I really didn   t have a whole lot of exposure to that. They were  delicate, small, really tiny, delicate pieces, very feminine, pretty things.  He did a lot of that for commission work as well. Then his brother, my  uncle Lance   he   s a marvelous painter   he works here as well. His  work is just fabulous. He works in acrylics and oil paints, I believe. His  work is on canvas, so I got really to know him better as well.  Once you had come to the Tribe, had you already gotten your Master   s  degree in Native Studies?  Oh, no. And I don   t have my Master   s   I have a first year of work in  that. I had left the tribe because I wanted to get my Master   s in Native  American Studies and Museum Studies at OSU. This was well into my  career here. Let me think, 2001. I decided that I wanted to become more  involved in the construction and the exhibits at the Chickasaw Cultural  Center, which had been a twenty-year process.  When I first came on board here, I attended meetings with tribal folk in  different towns to talk about what they would want in a museum or  cultural center. This project really meant a lot to me, enough that I  wanted to learn how to put together exhibits and that sort of thing. So, I  decided to take a sabbatical and go back to school. For a year, I studied  to get that degree and then got a phone call from Governor  Anoatubby ,  who wanted me to come back to work, and so I did, and still got to work  on the cultural center and its exhibits and see that to fruition, which was  really exciting.  It   s a fabulous museum. You   ve taught some art classes at various times.  Has your teaching impacted your art in any way?  Most of the art classes that I   ve taught have been beginning classes.  They   ve been classes for beginning students. And you actually learn a  lot from beginning students. That was a lot of fun. I haven   t gotten to do  that much in the last few years, I just don   t have the time. But going  13  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  back to the basics is always good. Going back and remembering all of  those foundational aspects of putting a piece of art together, I find  refreshing, really. It reminds you of really proper technique. Those  things that you   re trying to show students, they   re learning it for the very  first time. So, I would say, as far as my own art work, it reminds me a  great deal of the foundation of what you   re supposed to be doing.  Sometimes you don   t think of that, but you   re forced to when you   re  trying to teach it to somebody else.  Were you named a Master Artist of the Five Tribes?  No, and I don   t know where that came from. (Laughs)  It came from the Internet. But thank you for clarifying. (Laughs)  A lot of people   I will show up at different things that I am making a  presentation for   and that will be on my  bio . And it   s so embarrassing  because that is something I have not achieved yet. I   m sure the Five  Tribes Museum is out there thinking,    Well, that   s a little pretentious.     So, no, I haven   t got there yet. But my Uncle Clayburn, he did, he   s a  Master Artist.  I realize you weren   t immersed in the gallery scene as long as some  people, but I   m wondering what changes you might have noticed from  the    80s   the Indian art scene in the    80s and the    90s.  I think artists, Native American artists, are a lot more savvy now in the  business end of things. They can deal with the gallery owners, I think, a  lot more effectively than when I first started out. I didn   t care for the  whole gallery scene, quite honestly. I didn   t like it much. I   ve had some  not-so-good experiences with some of the galleries as far as, you do a lot  of the work and weren   t making a whole lot of the money at the end of  all things.  Or being paid promptly, did you have problems like that?  Yes, yes, that sort of thing as well. But because I haven   t really involved  myself with galleries for some time, I really don   t know what the scene  is like, but I see artists out there now, the young artists coming up, who  are, I think, a lot more savvy than I was and a lot more business minded  than I was, twenty-some odd years ago.  In 1990 the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed. You were already  working for the tribe, and I don   t know if you had to   artists also could  ask for letters from their tribe, allowing them to call themselves  Chickasaw artists. Did you have any experiences with that?  14  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Well, it was interesting because most shows and galleries didn   t really,  in the beginning, understand the law very well. They required a CDIB   Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood . And really, if you look at the  law, CDIB really doesn   t have a thing to do with it. It   s whether or not a  tribe recognizes you as an artist that belongs to them.  That can represent this particular tribe.  So, there was a lot of confusion in the very beginning and a lot of  controversy. Oh, my goodness, a lot of hurt feelings. Some artists that  had been working for years and had built a career and reputation as  Indian artists suddenly are being questioned, and that was really  unfortunate. I never really had to deal with that because I had a CDIB,  and that seemed to be all that anybody was interested in. We had  discussed here at the tribe, several artists. And, of course, Lona Barrick,  who   s over our Arts and Humanities division, had discussed several  years ago, the law and what the law seems to require, and the possibility  of putting together a letter that Governor might sign.  But it   s not something that they ever did because I think, quite honestly,  it   s not something that anybody really requires. They ask you for your  CDIB. And for the most part, Chickasaw artists have a CDIB, and they  present that. It wasn   t really an issue here so much. It was kind of an  interesting time to look at other tribes that did have major issues with it,  and also, the whole state-recognized artists. That was an odd thing that  was happening as well.  What   s one art award or honor that   s been particularly important to you  over the years?  An honor? I have to say, I   m always thrilled to death when I meet a  complete stranger and they know my art, and they   ll say,    Oh, I just  love your art,    or,    I just love what you wrote in that book.    Because  I   ve also had the opportunity to write while working here and publish a  couple of books. That   s the biggest honor. As far as the awards and that  sort of thing, I think recognition from Red Earth that one year for  Graphics really meant a lot, because I had, I felt like, finally reached that  place where the tribe and the traditional customs and the theme and the  different things that I   d hoped to come together must have, or they  wouldn   t have recognized that piece of artwork as being superior that  year. That felt good because then I knew I was on the right track.  In 1996, you were a part of a select group of artists that got to show  their work at the Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia. Did you  apply for that?  15  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  I   m really not sure how that came about. I was contacted by Lona  Barrick. Right now, she   s the administrator over at the Arts and  Humanities and she said,    Hey, we   re going to get together a group of  people,    and I think this museum contacted her. They were part of the  Olympic program in which they were trying to represent artists that were  indigenous to the area. These countries from all over the world were  coming in, and they wanted to show Native American art. They had to  contact us here in Oklahoma because we no longer are in our homelands,  so we said,    Yes, we   ll come there.    It was just two of us representing  the Chickasaw Nation, me and Joanna Underwood. She brought her  pottery, and I brought my paintings, and we loaded up a van and drove  out there. Lucky me, I got to fly. (Laughter) But Lona and Joanna and  another lady, Gingy Nail, they drove all of my paintings and the panels  and all the stuff you have to haul, and, of course, all of Joanna   s  wonderful pottery out to Atlanta. We set up, and it was really a terrific  week because we got to meet so many different people, not only people  from the Olympics, but other artists from the area were represented as  well. We were just the Indian faction. We never really got down to  where the Olympics were going on. Most of our activities took place  there at the museum.  That might have been fortunate because I think they had that terrorist  bombing there, too.  Yes, that was the one evening that we had free, and we thought we  would go down there, and I just wasn   t up to it. (Laughs) I was dead  tired, so we didn   t end up going, and it was a good thing. It was a good  thing we didn   t.  That   s a blessing. Had you been to the Southeast prior to that or visited  historical sites in the Chickasaw homelands?  No, my first trip, actual trip, that concentrated on the Homelands in  different sites was probably about five years ago, and that was an  extraordinary trip. I had been to the Southeast before, but it was mainly  to Memphis and places like Elvis Presley   s Graceland, and that sort of  thing. And to have the opportunity to actually go and take a tour of  historic sites along the Natchez Trace in Alabama on Bear  Creek , that  was great, that was fantastic. I had a great tour guide. She   s Chickasaw.  At that time she was working for the National Park Service, and she  agreed to take us around and show us all of these little known places and  tell us stories about them. And you get a wonderful feeling. I don   t even  know how to describe it when you visit where your ancestors came from  and where they   re buried. I have to take that back. I did go to various  museums during my NAGPRA days. I worked as a NAGPRA  16  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  representative.  Do you want to explain the Native American Graves and Repatriation  Act?  Yes. I was asked to participate on a negotiations type of committee for  the tribe and also for the Five Civilized Tribes  as  one of their  representatives during the first part of the NAGPRA days when  museums were having to declare what they had. I went and visited the  homelands then because there were human remains and funerary objects  that we had to decide what to do with and develop a policy for that. We  could either allow the museum to continue to curate, or we could take  them and put them in our own museum, which I don   t think was ever a  consideration. Or rebury them, which nine times out of ten, that   s what  we did. But that was the first time I actually went to the homelands. I  had forgotten about that. That was such a big part of my learning  experiences, especially with traditional people, because they would  accompany us as well for a better understanding of what was proper in  dealing with the deceased and their objects.  So, here at the Chickasaw press, you   ve obviously used your artistic  skills as well as writing skills on several of the publications. Do you like  that particular combination?  Oh, I really did. I was real nervous about it because I had never really  published a book before, and we were required to publish four books a  year from the tribe. They wanted us to at least put out four books a year.  They would always come out in October, so we had, basically, a year to  get four books completed.  That   s not a lot of time. (Laughter)  It was not a lot of time, but fortunately, we had some really, really nice  manuscripts that had been submitted to us  by  people who   d been  waiting forever for somebody to take an interest in their work. And there  just wasn   t an interest in some of the books that were being written  about Southeastern history and culture because there wasn   t a market.  Most publishing houses, they   re looking at the numbers,    Who   s going  to buy this? How much money are we going to make?    That was never  the goal or the mission of the Chickasaw Press. They just wanted to get  the information out there to people and to allow for an outlet. Not only  Chickasaw Native American authors, but authors that wrote about us, for  them to have an opportunity to have their book published. So, there were  a lot of really good manuscripts, and that made it a whole lot easier and  very exciting.  17  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  And you proved there was a market after you published them. (Laughs)  Yes, there was.  You   ve done some different types of board and service work, but one of  your positions has been on the Oklahoma Film Commission. Can you  talk about that?  Early on, in my career at the tribe, I had the opportunity to serve on that  commission, and I think it   s because I served on several committees  with the Oklahoma Indian Affairs Commission. So, my name was  submitted, and I was appointed. It was really an eye-opening experience  to meet a lot of the folks that are in the film industry here in Oklahoma  because when you think of film   or at least when I thought of film     I thought of where I came from, which was Hollywood, California,  maybe New York. But we had, really, quite an active film industry here.  If you   re looking at locations or if you   re looking at actors   oh, my  goodness  Native American actors here from Oklahoma are the best  anywhere. I had the opportunity to meet Casey  Camp  Hornik and  Richard  Whitman . And the projects that they were working on, it was  very exciting. During that time, there seemed to be a lot of friction  between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, but that seems to have subsided  somewhat over the years. It was an exciting time for me because I was  learning new things and meeting a lot of new and interesting people, and  learning about the film industry and how it worked here and how it  worked anywhere else. I still can   t believe that I had that opportunity  and it has led me to what I   m doing right now. (Laughs)  That segues nicely into your latest project, which is?  It   s a movie. The Chickasaw Nation for the last several years has  committed themselves to producing family-friendly Native American-based  movies because there seems to be a need for Indian tribes to tell  their story in their own way instead of being interpreted by others. This  was something that Governor Anoatubby was interested in. He jumped  out there with the first movie, Pearl, which was about Pearl Carter Scott,  a lady that was an early aviator, a very young early aviator. And the  movie has met with great reviews.  I wrote a play about Pearl eons ago, but I wasn   t really involved in the  movie itself. However, the United Nations had a program that was  interested in showing indigenous peoples    films to high school kids, and  ours fit right into that program. They asked me to participate, me and  several others here, to participate in writing curriculum for that, and we  did. We presented not too long ago to the U.N., to a group of kids that  had come, and that was a lot of fun.  18  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  So, I was asked to move into this project, which was about Te Ata. It   s  going to be a film project about somebody that nearly every Chickasaw  knows about, Te Ata Fisher. She was a storyteller and an entertainer,  from when she graduated from high school in 1919 all the way up until  she was unable to perform anymore. She retired in, probably,  the   1980s. She had this hugely wonderful, long career of telling stories and  singing and representing Native American culture to the King and  Queen of England, to the Roosevelts, and just hundreds and hundreds  and hundreds   maybe thousands and thousands   of children, which  seemed to be her favorite audience.  I   ve had, this past weekend, the opportunity to sit down and interview  several of her family members, people that knew her the best. And that  was an exciting thing to do. But we are now engaged in trying to write a  script about her life. That   s the project I   m working on now and pulling  my hair out. (Laughter) But it   s very exciting. It   s something brand new  for me, once again, but it   s a chance to use my writing skills to do a  movie script now. That and some of the cultural knowledge that I   ve  gotten over the years can also be used. It gives me a little bit of an  insight into where she came from because her family were language  speakers, and her father was very traditional. It   s, I think, a unique  opportunity for myself, but also for the tribe to show some of their oral  traditions and some of the things that she was known for and what she  had hoped to accomplish with her career and her life.  I think that sounds really exciting. Your primary tools are colored  pencil. What do you like about colored pencil?  They   re very forgiving, and so is oil paint. But the pencils are a whole  lot cleaner and easier to manage than oil painting. It takes longer to work  with colored pencils because you have to layer one color over another to  get the desired effect or the type of light that you   re hoping for. It takes a  tremendous amount of time. That   s why most of the pieces you see in  colored pencil are small, because it   s so time-consuming. But once you  get through with one, it   s so rewarding because you   ve got what you   ve  wanted and hoped for. I like to deal with a lot of very intricate pattern  and that sort of thing, and pencils are great for that. Paint, not so much,  but pencils, you just grind that pencil down to a fine tip, and you can  pretty much get what you want. (Laughter)  When you say forgiving, I hadn   t thought about it, but does that mean  you can erase colored pencil?  Yes. If you treat it right, you can erase, and you can pick things up. But  you have to plan ahead of time. It   s not something you just slap on there  19  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  and then think you   re going to erase a large section of it, because that   s  not going to happen. You have to have it well planned out ahead of time,  but if there   s something that you don   t quite like, you can pick it up in  small areas.  Portraits seem to be a strong thread of your work. What do you try to  convey with those?  I find people so interesting. I love talking to people and finding out what  they   re about and what their interests are, and I just find people   s faces  interesting, what they wear, how they do their hair. All of that is  something that I enjoy depicting. I guess it just simply comes from the  fact that I   m a people person. I just love talking to people and finding  out what they   re about. As far as themes for people, I get to know  people, and I try to represent what they   re about through portraiture.  Sometimes I   m successful, sometimes I   m not. But I find that if I know  them very well, the artwork comes out better for some reason than if I  don   t know them very well at all.  I   ve heard that the eyes in a portrait are kind of challenging, is that  something you found true?  Yes, and I   ve taken a lot of classes with folks who can do eyes well,  because eyes and hands seem to be difficult. Not only the structure and  trying to replicate them on a two-dimensional surface, but also, if you  don   t get the hands and the eyes right, you don   t get the person right.  You don   t get the essence of what maybe they   re doing or who they   re  about. That   s why I always do a face first, because if you don   t get the  face right, there   s no point in moving on, as far as I   m concerned. If you  don   t get the eyes in there correctly, and they   re not doing what they  need to represent that person   s personality, then you   ve lost the piece.  It   s time to start over.  Obviously, drafting skills are important for you. Do you do preliminary  sketches for your colored pencil work?  Yes, I work entirely from photographs, because people are just bored to  tears if they have to sit there for you. That   s just excruciating. (Laughter)  Most of my people are real people. They   re not models. They   re not  people that are used to it, so I work with photographs. In the early days,  I would use my own photographs, but I didn   t much care for the lighting.  I didn   t know enough about photography to really light them the way  that I wanted them to be lit. Of course, I didn   t have the person there, so  it would be hard to really try and remember,    Okay, how did that  actually go?    because the photograph, it   ll lie to you.  20  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  So, I made friends with a very good photographer. His name is Matt  Bradbury, and for the last several years he   s been setting the lights   I   ll  stand back and I   ll say,    Nah, don   t like it that way,    and he   ll move it  around and adjust it. I don   t know what I   m talking about. I just know  what I like, and he   ll get the lights right and shoot the photographs. And  I have been much happier with the final results in the artwork when I use  his photography.  I don   t know if that   s cheating or not, but I prefer to use photographs  that I   ve had some input on the lighting. When I am trying to do the  photography myself, I don   t have input because I don   t know what I   m  doing. (Laughs) And I suppose I should take the time and do a  photography class, but it takes years to understand the whole lighting  thing. (Laughter) And I   ve been very fortunate that Matt likes doing it.  It   s exciting for him. I   ve been fortunate that he has allowed me to  prevail upon him to shoot my folks.  Sounds like a good solution. How important is humor in your work?  Oh, I think it   s very important. I want folks to feel good when they take  a look at a piece of my artwork. That   s why I   ve never really done a  Removal piece. I know that it   s a popular thing among the Five Tribes  for artists to do Removal pieces. But, for me, I feel like it   s been done.  It   s been done and it   s been done. A Chickasaw removal has been  done   it   s an outstanding piece by Tom Phillips   it   s like the  quintessential Removal piece. And you get a certain feeling when you  come back from it, but it   s not the feeling that I want people to have  when they look at my art. I know it   s important, but it   s really not  something   I would probably get so depressed trying to complete a  Removal piece.  Most of my work I try to infuse family, and women and children, and  those events and activities that might be something considered small and  not very important, but are tremendously important, not only to the  families, but to the tribe as a whole. Those story-telling moments, those  moments when recipes are shared from one generation to the next,  taking care of a child, nurturing, that sort of thing. That seems to be what  trips my trigger. (Laughter)  Just following up on representations of women and children, mothers  and grandmothers and those nurturing bonds, can you comment on the  importance of women in Chickasaw Culture?  Oh, tremendously important. Women are tremendously important and  always have been down through the centuries. We were a matrilineal  society. You belong to your mother   s family when you were born. It   s  21  Little Thunder  Barbour  not to say that men weren   t important, they were, but women and their  roles were always the glue that sort of kept everything together, that kept  the tribe together socially. It was the elder women that knew who was  related to who, and who could actually marry who, that sort of thing. It   s  a little-known fact, but there was an elder group of women down  through the centuries that was always consulted before any decisions of  war took place, because they came at it from a totally different  perspective. It was always considered important to consult with these  ladies.  So, I think, today, we have women in really important positions at the  tribe on a government level, but on a family level, there   s always that  matriarch. There   s always that one lady who everybody goes to, who   s  got all the answers, who knows pretty much everything there is to know  about how you   re related to other people, still, and the important  decisions in life. Everybody goes to that person because they   re the ones  with the experience and the knowledge. Grandfathers are important for  that also, but Grandmas seem to know what the family is about. They  seem to know everything there is to know about anything having to do  with the family, and I think that is extremely important, especially in this  day and age. And for Chickasaws, Governor Anaotubby and this  administration also seem to want to provide whatever they can to help  the family, and I agree with that. I like to represent family. I had a great  family, growing up. I have wonderful memories, and I like to depict  those.  Taking up this notion of the council of women that would be consulted  before Chickasaws went to war, when you focus on these less well-known  aspects of Chickasaw culture, is one of your goals to educate  other Indian people as well as non-Indians?  Yes, and there are certain things you don   t depict. There are certain  things in our culture not allowed to be told, at least, not by me and not in  artwork that will be seen by non-Chickasaws. But a lot of the work that I  do, I have the opportunity to educate about things that are special in our  culture that can be told, and that   s great. Writing about the illustration is  just as important to me as doing the illustration itself, because it allows  me the opportunity to explain something about what somebody   s  wearing or what somebody   s doing or the event that this person may be  involved in. Those things are important and may be lost on folks that  aren   t familiar with the culture. Unfortunately, with our tribe, we   ve lost  a lot of that, and there   s a real hunger out there, especially among  Chickasaws outside of Oklahoma who want to know more, who want to  read more. It   s like they just want to absorb whatever they can because  it   s part of their identity. And being able to share those things is  immensely rewarding for me, personally, because I was lucky enough to  22  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  have them shared with me at one point or another.  What is your creative process?  Sometimes it   s dreams. Sometimes I   ll see something and I   ll think,     Oh, that was so neat, I need to do that.    And sometimes, with  commission pieces, I   m just asked to put together something that  represents a central theme. The last really big project that I worked on  was for St. Anthony   s Hospital. Somebody came to me and said,    I will  pay for this project, but we   re donating it to St. Anthony   s Hospital.    So,  they wanted something   they really didn   t nail me down on anything.  They just said,    We want something that will represent abundance and  good health and just fullness of life.    I had seen a lady here at the tribe  who reminded me a lot of all of that in her traditional regalia. I decided  to use some symbolism with her, and she very graciously allowed me to  photograph her. We photographed her with corn and a black bird, which  represents a lot of very positive things having to do with good health and  abundance and that sort of thing. It was a very large painting, probably  one of the largest ones that I   ve ever done, and I decided to do it in oil.  That was a different way of going at it. I was given the general idea of  what they wanted to have hanging on the wall, and then I was left to try  and pull it together. But for the most part, it could be anything. Like I  said, a dream, something I just see in passing     Will you sketch it real quickly or just keep it in your head?  Yes, with my little stick figures. (Laughter) I   ll talk about it more than  anything in a little diary that I have.    Okay, I saw this and this, and this  is what it represents to me,    and,    I could use this, and I could use that.     All of these little ideas get stored up in a diary, and eventually, I   ll get  around to them. But for the most part, it   s just a diary of a lot of little  ideas because, right now, I haven   t had the opportunity to really do a  whole lot of my own artwork.  You   ve explained very nicely your interest in people. I don   t see a lot of  developed landscapes in your work, but I do see a lot of animal imagery,  often people and animals coupled together, and I wondered if you could  talk about that from a Chickasaw cultural viewpoint.  Well, animals played a really   and still do play a really big role in a lot  of cultural ideas, a lot of cultural belief systems within the tribe. Oral  tradition, for instance, a lot of our stories are animals talking to each  other about complicated issues. And I   m lucky enough to get to illustrate  a book with some of those animal stories in it. But I use the animals  usually to try and illustrate either a cultural statement that I   m trying to  23  Little Thunder  Barbour  make or, for instance, with the Raccoon clan and the Bird clan, the little  boy and little girl, sort of my interpretation of Pinky and Blue Boy, it  was an opportunity to represent a couple clans. The Bird clan was a big  warrior clan for the tribe, and the Raccoon clan was also a very  interesting clan. So, it was an opportunity to talk about those two clans,  and so I put the animal figures in there to also illustrate that. That   s  pretty simplistic, there.  Some of the other things that I   ve done, like The Journey, where I   m  using animals and different objects, are a little more complicated and in-depth.  That takes a little more explanation to go into because not  everybody understands what some of the symbolism means, especially  the Mississippian period symbols. You have to do a little bit of study to  figure out what some of those different symbols represent. I try to use  those to basically harken back to that old system of belief that  everything was based in Nature, everything had a purpose, and the  purpose wasn   t always right there in front of your face. Some of it was  hidden. Talking about the three different levels of what Chickasaws used  to believe the universe was about, the tree of life, those types of things, I  find just immensely interesting. And all kinds of opportunity arise from  these things to talk about how intricate and how special Chickasaw  culture really is and was.  It   s kind of a new avenue that I   m going in, lately, but it   s something  that I think is important. We really started using a lot of that with the  cultural center and trying to explain what some of this means in some of  the programs down there. A lot of our printed pieces have the different  symbols from that period, and they   re beautiful. They   re beautiful  symbols, and they each have a meaning, and they have a purpose. And  putting them in the art work not only gives it a Southeastern flavor or  feel, but there   s meaning there, that I can convey beyond what I   ve used  in the past.  What has been one of the high points in your art career so far?  Getting to work on books and using some of the cultural knowledge and  art in designing books, that was pretty cool. Having the opportunity to  paint and actually get paid for it, or to draw and actually get paid for it,  that people will pay me money to do this, that   s really a high point for  me. (Laughter) But also, I think in my art career, just having the  opportunity to study and to talk to the elders about our culture and our  traditions, because they are the receptacles of all that knowledge. To just  be lucky enough to get to talk to them, not only about what they know  about culture, but about their lives. What exciting lives they   ve lived.  They grew up in a time when it wasn   t very popular to be an Indian  person. In fact, federal government was trying to assimilate them, yet  24  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  they hung onto the language. They hung onto these beliefs, and they  lived events in their lives that were exciting and sometimes horrific and  have seen so many things in the twentieth century and what their  perspective is. That   s a high point, and really, the art is what brought me  to that more than anything else.  What has been a low point in your art career?  A low point    Not getting to do it as much as I want to. I feel very  guilty about that. I really do. I get irritated at myself because I   ll come  home dead tired, and I might have two hours that I could be working on  artwork, and I just want to hit the hay, you know? And then I lay there  and feel really bad about it. (Laughter) But I would say I wish I had  more time. I wish I had more time to do the artwork, but the projects that  I work on for the tribe are just as important to me, and they   re very time-consuming.  It   s never been a nine-to-five job. It   s weekends. It   s nights.  It   s whenever other people are available to talk to me. That   s when I get  a lot of my work done. So, I would say artwork, not getting to do it.  That   s a low point.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about or anything we forgot to  mention?  I have a son. He is also very interested in art, but in his younger years,  he did a lot of drawing and a lot of painting, but he has sort of  transferred that to videography. It   s a medium I don   t know anything  about, but he has that same kind of drive and interest and obsession that  I had about drawing. He has it for videography and putting together  video projects, and that   s exciting to see. That   s really neat because I can  see in him a lot of the way I was when I first started out with the  artwork, only he   s into video. And I   m very proud of the projects he   s  put together, I have to say. He   s very good.  That   s neat. So, that artistic legacy is     It   s another generation down, yes.  (Laughs) Alright, well, we   re going to take a look at some of your  artwork. Would you like to tell us about this piece?  This piece is called A New Day Dawning. I was asked to participate in a  project a few years back in which we celebrated the 150th anniversary of  our Chickasaw Constitution. I was asked to put together a piece of  artwork that they could put on print pieces and develop a poster out of  and note cards and that sort of thing. And, of course, I immediately went  to what women might have thought about this constitution. At the time,  25  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  Barbour  there was a newspaper called the Chickasaw Intelligencer that was out  there. I did a little bit of research, could not find the actual newspaper, so  I made my own.  I thought women would be reading about this, Chickasaw women. They  would be interested in knowing what this new constitution was about  and when it was going to be ratified, and they would be attending the big  constitutional discussion and event that took place at Pennington Creek,  down in what was then Tishomingo City. It   s Tishomingo now. So, I  thought,    We   ll have these two ladies read the newspaper and find out  what this constitution was about.    It was a brand new way of looking at  tribal government for us and, of course, the ladies would be involved. I  used ladies that work here at the tribe as my models, and they, again,  very graciously allowed me to photograph them reading the newspaper.  A good example of your realistic style. Now we   re looking at a couple of  cards, reproductions of originals. Would you like to talk about those?  The one with the man, the Indian man with the baby, that   s actually my  son, Micah, and his father. He was not very old at all, and I just took a  photograph of them sleeping, not in buckskin. He was in a T-shirt and a  pair of jeans, but I included the buckskin. I just thought,    What a sweet,  sweet picture.    This seems to really resonate with a lot of moms. A lot  of moms like this.  And this one?  The other one is the Story Teller, and it is a piece that I did several years  ago with Glenda Galvin. She was telling stories with a group of children,  and she   s one of our traditional story tellers. Her stories have been  passed down in her family for many generations, and of course, most of  them are about animal stories. In the background, the trees back there  are actually animals, some of the animals that you would see in these  stories. I did this as something I wanted to do. This is a piece that I  wanted to do, and the tribe liked it so much they used it as a theme that  particular year for their festival   oral tradition and paying homage to  the elders and like that. So, it worked out well. It worked out well for  them to have a printed piece and for me to get to do a piece of artwork  that I   ve been wanting to do for some time.  I think I   ll have you hold up those original illustrations for the book.  Okay. This is the Tree of Life, and I wanted to do something that would  represent one of the central ideas in old Chickasaw beliefs about how the  world was and how it was put together. But I wanted to do it in such a  way that it would be of interest to children, that children might be able to  26  Little Thunder  Barbour  Little Thunder  connect with it. It   s a tree, and the upper part of the tree and its branches  stretch into the heavens. The middle part of the tree is actually where we  are at on earth, and then the roots of the tree go into the underworld. It   s  an explanation of how the world is, basically.  You have the heavenly body, which everything is in order, everything is  the way it should be. Then you   ve got chaos that takes place down in the  underneath world where the roots are. And we are in the middle,  constantly being impacted between chaos and perfect order. Of course,  animals are part of that. And if you went with this strict Mississippian  belief of what these animals are, anything with wings would be from the  heavens, anything that flies is from that part of the world that has got  perfect order. Anything that is below the water would be from a place of  chaos. And then there are super natural animals, which I did not  represent here. Some of those animals can travel in between all of these  different parts of the universe, through different, I guess, portals, in old  Mississippian belief. But I tried to represent that in a way that kids might  connect with and make the animals whimsical and kind of fun. And this  was a departure for me. It   s more cartoony kind of illustration. And it  was fun.  I bet. We   ll just go ahead and look at a couple of the other illustrations  for the same book     This will be the cover of the book. This is Crawfish and the creation  story. That   s one of the illustrations for that first story in the book, which  talks about how the earth was created. The story starts out where all the  animals of the earth are on a raft. And I got to thinking,    Well, how am I  going to represent that?    And I thought,    They   re going to be really  crowded, and they   re just going to be somewhat uncomfortable.    Some  of them looking off into other areas, wondering,    Hey, what are we  doing here?    So, that   s how I represented the raft. Then I put some  Mississippian period symbols in the raft itself. But the story is basically  about how Crawfish was able to fix the dilemma. Because they   re on  this watery waste, floating aimlessly, and he said,    Why don   t I go down  and bring some mud up? Why don   t I create earth?    (Showing the  artwork) So, that   s what this one is. It   ll be on another page, basically,  like that, on that side. He   s got his mud chimney there. And he   s starting  to create earth and, of course, I included the buzzard on the first one  because the buzzard created the valleys and the mountains with his  wings later on. But this is the first story. The next story will be about a  duck, her babies, and a wolf. (Laughs)  Well, we look forward to seeing this book come out, and I want to thank  you, Jeannie, for your time today.  27  Barbour Well, thank you. This was such a pleasure. I   ve had a great time.  -------  -------
