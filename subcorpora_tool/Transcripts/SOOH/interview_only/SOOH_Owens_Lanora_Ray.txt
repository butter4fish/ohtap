 Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Today is Saturday, July 16, 2011. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn. I   m  with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library.  I   m at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art today interviewing Lanora Ray  Owens, who will be talking about her memories of the 1930s. Thank you  so much for joining us today.  I   m delighted to have the opportunity.  Lanora, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you  tell us where you were born and a little bit about your early life?  Yes. One o   clock on a Monday afternoon, October 19, 1931, the main  event was taking place in the front bedroom of my grandparents    house  at 1016 Northwest 32nd. It   s just east of Western down from Our Lady   s  Catholic Church. It was a nice little neighborhood, then. It   s a ghetto  today, unfortunately. It was a nice kind of lower-middle class  neighborhood. It wasn   t unusual in 1931 to be born at home. It would be  now, but it wasn   t then. I remember my mother telling about it. She was  in the front bedroom giving birth and she said every time she   d groan,  everyone in the front room groaned. (Laughs) Because they could hear  her, and she could hear them. My grandmother, Lizzy Owens, later it  was Elizabeth, but it was really Lizzy, said that the doctor handed me to  her and I looked up and tried to say something and it became the family  joke because I   ve been talking ever since. (Laughter)  We all lived there. I don   t know how. I look back at it and wonder how  we did. It was a two-bedroom house, one bathroom. The back porch had  been screened in and made into a little room. But off and on    Well,  there was my father and my mother, Ray and Ruth, Grandma and Papa,  Lizzy Owens and Thurman Ray Owens. She was Lizzy Cunningham.  Daddy   s brothers and sisters, there was T. Woodward (Woody), he was  next and then Elmeta, Edna, and then Jimmy. We were all in the house.  5  Of course, growing up, I don   t remember being crowded. I don   t. It was  a joyful time, as far as I can tell. I ran the neighborhood as a youngster.  When Woody came home once, and he had a friend, Keith, he told  Grandma, he said,    Keith doesn   t have anywhere to go,    and Grandma  said,    Well, bring him in.    So at some count, I think there were thirteen  of us in that house. (Laughs)  Everybody worked and you had a work ethic because if you didn   t work,  you didn   t eat. So in the early 1930s, Grandma had a backyard with a  vegetable garden. She had a goat because Papa had stomach troubles and  the goat milk was supposed to be good for him. So she had a vegetable  garden, a goat and chickens. That   s how she fed us, often. I remember  Daddy had to drop out of high school so he could get a job. He wanted  to be a golfer, and what he would do, he went to the Oklahoma City Golf  and Country Club, which was then located where the Christian church is  now. The church they call the Church to the Heavens, the    spaceship  church,    that was the Oklahoma City Golf and Country Club. He got a  job as a caddy. He eventually became caddy master, which was quite an  important position in those days. He made good money with tips. He  would bet guys that he could drive the ball further with one hand, he  could drive it further than they could with two. He would bet them a  dollar and he won a lot of dollars. He was a heck of a golfer.  He   s immortalized in the newspaper. He held the record at that time for  continuously driving balls. It was just to have a job. His hands had to be  bandaged, they were bleeding. But people were proud of working. They  were proud of what they did. He got a job, I remember once at Piggly  Wiggly, which became Homeland, which is now where Bruno   s, the  furniture store and it   s now Hoffman   s Furniture Store at 36th and  Western. He got a job at the grocery store and at Christmas, the bonus  was you got a box of food. I still remember, he came home from work, it  was Christmas Eve night. He had this cardboard box of food. I  remember Grandmother crying, picking out bags of beans and flour  and    I didn   t know why she was crying, I didn   t understand, but I knew  it was a happy time. I knew there was a great deal of happiness involved  in it, and a ham. I still remember what was in that box. We didn   t go  hungry.  Grandma would go out in the back yard, take a chicken in each hand. It  was an art. Whap, we had chicken for Sunday dinner. She would  make    I think she invented the pancake sandwich, pigs in a blanket? It  didn   t come in a box. She had buttermilk and she made the batter and  this big iron skillet and she would make one gigantic pancake. Papa  would have that pancake with an egg and a sausage and fold it over and  that was breakfast. Plenty to eat. Papa worked for Sears and  Montgomery Ward and for Oklahoma Furniture and Oklahoma  6  Furniture Company. He had what I thought was this big glorious pickup.  I   ve seen them from the thirties and they   re just these tiny little things,  but with that pickup, he would deliver the refrigerators and the stoves  and hook them up. Daddy and Woody would help when they weren   t  working at the golf course or somewhere else. Elmeta, the oldest girl,  when she graduated she got a job downtown as a secretary. She made  ten dollars a week and Grandma cried again because she said she was  going to have banker   s hours.  On the farm, they said you worked from    can see,    to    can   t see.    As  soon as you could see, you got up and went to work and you worked  until the sun went down and you couldn   t see. So banker   s hours were to  be prized. You went to work at something like eight o   clock and got off  at five, and that was just remarkable. The fun was, when I was just a  baby, Mama would walk up and catch the streetcar on Shartel and take  the streetcar downtown. She got a job cleaning in the Concord Building.  That paid enough money that she could go to beauty school. So she went  to beauty school, and then from then on, wherever we lived with one  exception, she had a beauty shop. She either worked at a beauty shop or  had one in our home and made enough to keep us going. I would walk  up 32nd to Edgemere. It was an elementary school. It   s still there. Still  going strong. In those days, you didn   t mind that your child walked all  over. From kindergarten (you) walked to school and walked home. It  was a different time entirely. You could play until after dark, there were  no fences in any backyards. In the summertime you slept out on cots in  the backyard because you didn   t have air conditioning and it was too  hot. No one thought anything about children sleeping outside in the  backyard on cots with no fences and no security.  The big thing was radio. Of course, there was no television. Papa, he  was such a dear man. I   ve thought back and anybody was welcome in  the house. Grandma was feeding everybody and he just kept working.  But when Joe Lewis fought, President Roosevelt spoke, or the Grand  Ole Opry was on, he had charge of the radio for those three things. It  was just a given. When I was about three or so, times got really tough. I  had to go live with my Grandma Smith, my mother   s mother in Cushing.  Believe it or not, at the age of three, they took me to the train station,  which was downtown. We   re not far from it here. A real train station and  gave me to the conductor and sent me off to Cushing. The train went  from here to Cushing. Grandma and Irene were at the station in Cushing  to greet me and they asked the conductor,    How   d she do?    He said,    I  don   t know. She was up and down the aisle talking to everybody. So I  don   t know how she did.     But I   ve thought back and thought, there   s no way on earth you   d do that   now . You couldn   t put a child on the train and trust everybody to look  7  after the child. But I made several train trips and then the bus came and I  went on the bus. Life in Cushing was different than life in Oklahoma  City. It was, I   d say, easier, slower. My Aunt Irene was a schoolteacher  and my Grandma Smith, Lily Smith, they lived together because Irene  was the one of the four sisters, actually, one step-sister, who wasn   t  married, so she got to live with her mother. They didn   t have a car.  Neither grandmother ever had a driver   s license or owned a car. Never  drove a car. I remember Grandma Lizzy, her dream was to drive an  eighteen wheeler. I   ve often thought, bless her heart. I imagine she  would have been able to drive an eighteen wheeler, too, if she   d ever  gotten the opportunity, but she didn   t get the opportunity. She was the  one who wanted to move to the city. Her family lived around Minco and  they were all farmers and some of the happiest people I   ve ever known  in my life. I don   t know what they were so happy about because they  didn   t have anything. She didn   t want to live in the country. She wanted  to live in the city. So they moved to the city and she loved the city life.  So they never went back to the farm.  We would pack up that little old pickup I told you about. We had clothes  and things that people had outgrown and we would gather all that up and  put it in the truck and sometimes, until I got too big, they   d let me sit up  front with Grandma and Papa. I really wanted in the back. All the kids  would pile in the back of that truck with everything and off we   d go and  drive down to around Minco. We took clothes and then we brought back  food. And they got to see each other. They loved each other dearly. They  got to visit. I didn   t like the country life either. They got up at dawn and  had pork chops for breakfast, biscuits. I   ve never seen so much food in  my life. Then you had chores to do and the cows would hit you with  their tail. I wanted to live in the city, too. That   s how people shared and  took care of each other because there wasn   t enough to go around. The  farmers were dying out there with the dust. They sent me off to Cushing  because there wasn   t enough money to take care of me.  My brother was born in    37. My mother had lost a child in between us.  Full grown. At St. Anthony   s, that   s where my brother Larry was born,  at St. Anthony   s. I would go off to my Grandma Smith   s, which was a  blessing because they doted on me. I was the only little one around and I  got all the attention and all the love. They were sweet and gentle people.  My Aunt Irene taught me to read before I ever went to kindergarten. She  handed me a book one day and said,    When I get home I   m going to  teach you to read.    I sat all day long on this porch holding this book,  trying to make out what it said on the cover. I had no idea. When she  came home, I don   t know how she did it, but by the time I got to the first  grade, I could read a book. That book was Five Little Peppers and How  They Grew. I don   t know if you   ve ever read it, but it   s a wonderful little  funny story. So I loved living there and I would go back and forth. I  8  know this is disjointed, but I guess that   s okay.  Just after Larry was born, he was about six months old, Daddy got a job  in the oil field in Cement, Oklahoma. And it is C-E-M-E-N-T, Cement,  and we moved there and it was wonderful. I was six, so I thought it had  a mountain. I went back as an adult and of course, it wasn   t a mountain.  It was this big rock outcropping. But as a six year old, I thought it was a  mountain and I was free to climb all over it and all the kids did and you  caught tadpoles. You   d find little pools of water and you   d put them in  the fruit jar and you put the cap on and take them home and you had  tadpoles. On Sundays, the women in the church always made great  meals. Best chocolate pie I ever ate in my life was at one of those. Then  that job dried up, so we left there and we went to Capitol Hill.  All I remember about that, while we lived there, we went to the fair. For  some reason, I remember that. We went to the fair. In those days, the fair  was pretty spectacular. Very memorable. You went on the streetcar and  it was over on the east side of town. It was dirt, sawdust and smells     wonderful greasy hamburgers. Sideshows that were staggering. People  swallowing swords and doing all sorts of things. We all thought  cigarettes   (the adults did) and until what,    70s, we all thought  cigarettes were wonderful. The big thing at the fair, the grandstands,  when it got nighttime, you   d go to the grandstands. It   s not the same  anymore, but you went to the grandstand. When the night came and they  turned all the lights out, that was part of the big show. They   d say to  everyone,    Get out your matches or your cigarette lighters.    Everybody  had matches and cigarette lighters. They would count down and on the  stroke of zero, everybody struck a match or their cigarette lighter and we  were all so impressed. It was beautiful. I suppose if you tried that now,  nobody would have a match or a cigarette lighter. (Laughs)  But the fair was wonderful. Streetcars were wonderful. We never should  have done away with them. Streetcars were wonderful. I could walk up  still in the    30s, I would go    Grandma   s house was at 1016 Northwest  32nd. Right next east of that house, we eventually lived in that house as  well. Momma worked at a beauty shop downtown. But while we lived  there, I would walk up to Shartel and catch the streetcar and go  downtown to the terminal. It was right down in the main part of town  where there was Kerr   s, which was so elegant. I always thought,    God,  if you ever grew up and made money and could go to Kerr   s and buy  something, it would be heaven.    There was Kerr   s. Then there was John  A. Brown   s. I worked at John A. Brown. All children grew up and  worked at John A. Brown, just about. It was a wonderful big old  department store. There hasn   t been one like it since.  Mrs. John A. Brown really ran it because her husband had died. It was  9  filled with women who worked there who I   m sure weren   t paid much,  even by those standards. But they knew their merchandise. They knew  everything. They knew where every button was, every needle or thread  or fabric or shoe. Whatever you wanted, they knew their merchandise,  they loved their job and they were good to all of us. This was not the     30s, but like in the    40s and    50s when you were old enough and you  could go to work at John A. Brown   s. They were all so good to the  youngsters. They were kind with them. Then there was Street   s and  Green   s, Veazey   s. Veazey   s was the huge drug store. It was the place to  go. There was a mezzanine. If you were really flush, you could go to the  mezzanine and they had coconut cake in a big cake stand, and it was like  a six layer coconut cake. You went up on the mezzanine and you had  coconut cake, if you were lucky.  Places like Green   s had a soda fountain. A real old fashioned soda  fountain where you could sit down and have a malt or a sundae or a  banana split for next to nothing, not by today   s standards. Criterion   Theater . Oh, that was a magic place. I still remember, my dad took me  when I was a very little girl. He bought me a doll and he took me to see  Gulliver   s Travels, the original, at the Criterion. It was a place of red  velvet curtains and faux Egyptian art all over the walls, sconces. The big  curtains would part on the stage and they would lift up and then the  movie would start. Just a magic land. If you went around the corner,  there was the Midwest. The Midwest, when you walked in the door, here  was this grand staircase. It was just glorious. One went this way, one  went that way. They had red velvet, you walked up the grand staircase to  go to the movie and inside, the seating was all midnight blue with stars  twinkling through. It was just gorgeous.  Everybody went downtown to the movies. We don   t do that anymore.  Well, maybe it   s coming back. I don   t know. But everybody went  downtown. Nobody went to the suburbs for anything. We didn   t have  malls or strip malls or any of that. Convenience stores. The biggest  convenience store was on Western, just up from Grandma   s house, it  was called Kagey   s. You could go into Kagey   s and for a nickel, you  could get all the candy on earth and a bottle of soda pop. One time, when  I was being born, they sent Jimmy. He was the little one. They sent him  up to Kagey   s and told him not to come home until somebody came after  him. He went to Kagey   s and got an orange, as I recall, and waited until  someone came after him, I guess, to see the baby.  I meant to tell you, the sweetest thing. After I was born and they  announced Mama   s fine, baby   s fine and I   m still in the front bedroom  of course, Papa went in and put on his one suit, his Sunday suit. He wore  it to church every Sunday, the only suit he owned. He put it on to come  see his first grandbaby. When I grew up and I heard that story, it really  10  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  got to me. I just thought how sweet that is. Papa never said two words.  He never got a chance. Lizzy was a talker and he had all these people  around, but I admire the man a great deal because family seemed to  mean a great deal to him. I never heard him complain about anybody  living there. Once he told me,    Why don   t you go home?    I remember I  said to him,    But I am home, Papa.    We lived on the back porch and he  just wanted the little ones to get out from under his feet for a minute, I   m  sure.    But I am home, Papa.    I guess guys do that now and I just don   t  know it. But he was kind of a remarkable fellow. Then Daddy and  Woody owned a little driving range for a while. Everybody was trying to  do something to make a living.  How did your father learn how to play golf?  By being a caddy.  Just picked it up naturally?  Just picked it up. He was just a natural athlete. He was just natural at it.  He loved golf. But he got married at nineteen in the    30s and I was born  when he was twenty. I don   t know that he regretted it, but I   ve always  thought it was kind of a shame, in a way, because he loved golf, and he  loved being there, but he needed to go to work. So he became a  salesman and worked at Sears as a salesman.  Did he ever teach you how to play golf?  No, he didn   t. My father had a problem with alcohol. From hanging  around golf courses. (Laughs) But I remember once, we were living  there on Northwest 32nd and he took me with him to the golf course. He  would take me with him. I had to be a little older after this incident. I  was just about four or five. Of course, I was in heaven. We spent all day,  we spent all evening. The guys played poker in the evening. They put  me up on a tall three-legged stool beside them, got an orange soda pop, I  helped them play poker. Of course, it was such fun. But when we got  home, my mother had a fit.    How could you keep that child out  there   ?    I was thinking I had a wonderful time. So he liked golf  courses a lot and you get to playing golf and drinking and not, you  know. So that had a lot to do with    And then he died when he was  forty-eight.  Wow, really young.  Very young. For a time, we lived over on the Northeast side of town. We  lived at lots of places. We lived over there and the reason it   s memorable  to me, we weren   t there long. In the fifth grade, I went to five schools.  11  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  So you can tell, we were skipping around pretty good. On the Northeast  side of town, I remember it because I was playing with some kids and I  fell in a slush pit and I was covered with oil from head to toe. I went  home dripping. It   s memorable because of my mother   s reaction. That   s  all I remember about living in the Northeast side of town. We lived in  Warr Acres for a while, that was not a good occasion because none of  us, mother wasn   t going to work for a while. We were going to live in  this suburb with chickens and Daddy would bring a dog to us. He would  bring a stray dog home. That didn   t work out too well. We left there and  finally in   this isn   t the    30s, but finally we settled. We moved to  Britton in January of 1942 and that was it. We lived on a little tiny street  called Vincent, Mother had a beauty shop. Eventually, she bought the  Allman   s house right around the corner on Britton Road. From then on,  she remarried later, but Britton was pretty much it for all of us.  Growing up between Oklahoma City and Cushing, that had to be a big  change.  It was. In Cushing the school was right across the street. Grandma and  Irene lived, I don   t even remember the name of the street, I   m sorry, but  they lived here  motions  and the grade school was here  motions , just  literally right across the street. Irene didn   t teach here. She taught at  another school. A friend of hers, Gwen, had a car and they would go.  But when I went to school, I just had to walk right across the street. That  was very different. We didn   t have a car. But Irene had a beau, Henry.  Uncle Henry, he became. On Sundays, Uncle Henry would come and get  us in his car and the four of us would go for a Sunday drive. I loved  Sunday drives. They were wonderful. We   d go around and just look at  things. Go through the countryside and coming back home, we came  over the bridge, into downtown Cushing, which wasn   t very big. You  came over the bridge and if you turned right, you were going to get an  ice cream cone. If you went straight ahead, you were going home, but  we mostly turned right. And for a nickel, you got a cone and it had a  place to hold ice cream on either side of it for a nickel. So you got two  scoops of ice cream and a cone for a nickel. That   s pretty good. So we  would go for Sunday drives. It was wonderful. There wasn   t anything to  do in Cushing except play. We played outside a lot. You had friends and  you ran. I didn   t have a bicycle or anything.  Did you play games of any sort?  Oh, yes. We played Simon Says. There was a game called Ice Box, I  haven   t a clue why it was called Ice Box, but it had to do with you stood  against a tree trunk and hid your face and somebody drew a circle on  your back and something about ice box and then when you    Of course,  you had to count to twenty five. Then when you looked up, of course,  12  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  everybody was hiding. You had to find them and touch them and they  had to run and touch the tree. I have no idea why we thought it was such  fun, but we did. You played in garages. Everybody had a garage.  Detached, but a garage. They almost all were in some disrepair. The  people would stack boxes and things and they had wooden slats. We  played in garages and just had fun. They were wonderful. They were  castles or ships or things we had seen in a movie, maybe. Movies were  big, comic books were big. We just made up stories and played and  really had a wonderful time.  Then I got a bicycle, my Uncle Henry gave me an old boys bike. It was  freedom. Absolute freedom. On 32nd, you go down from Western and  then there   s a giant hill with your little    It was a giant hill. It goes  straight up, like a hill, and you   d go up the hill with roller skates first.  We had the kind of roller skates that you had to have the key to adjust  them to fit you. You   d go up to the top of this hill and down. It was very  brave. Very brave. You were very brave, very adventurous     Fearless.  Fearless. Fearless. Then on the bicycle, the way I learned, and most  people did, I   m sure, I got on and I was doing pretty well, but I couldn   t  stop. I didn   t know how to stop. So you ran into a tree. That stopped  you. Then when you   d learn to go around a corner, you   d always skid on  the gravel and get all banged up, but you went right back to do it again  because the bicycle was just wonderful. It was better than skates, it was  better than anything until the car came along. But nobody, almost no one  had cars. You drive around streets now, it   s amazing, when everybody is  home, everybody has a car. Two or three in the family. My family just  didn   t have that. Of course, we   re blessed now-a-days with the things  that we do have. But I never felt poor. We were. I look back on it and we  were poor. But I never ever felt it. Nobody ever mentioned not having.  No one talked about what we didn   t have. I never heard anybody in the  family and I really thought about it, I never heard them talk about,    If  only I had       Now, people had to have a job, it was just a given. You  went to work. You went to school, then you went to work. I was the first  one to go to college, except Irene.  My mother   s father, Walter A. Smith. The A didn   t stand for anything. It  was Walter A. Smith. He was a Baptist minister in Sentinel, Oklahoma.  He went around debating on a topic,    give God the glory throughout the  ages.    He baptized people in the creek. I have a wonderful picture of  him. He was a tall, slender, raw boned looking fellow. He was evidently  a wonderful    People loved to hear him talk. What was I telling you? I  got off into Walter A. Smith.  13  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Along those lines, I was wondering if you went to church much growing  up.  Yes. If you were in Lizzy   s house, you went every time the doors  opened. You went to Sunday School, you went to Baptist Young  People   s, you went to evening church, you went to Vacation Bible  School. Yes, if you were in Lizzy   s house, you went to church. If you  were in Cushing, not so much. Maybe you went a Sunday or two. I was  going to tell you about    That was it. Walter was married and had two  children, Lema and Leonard. His wife died and he married my  grandmother, Lily. Lily Shelton. Had three daughters. One of them was  my mother. Irene, Ruth and Opal. So, he died young, leaving Grandma  Lily with    Lema was home and the three young daughters. I   m a great  admirer of my Aunt Lema. It wasn   t her mother and it wasn   t her  responsibility. She was like sixteen, seventeen. She took the  responsibility. She taught school. She didn   t have to go to college. She  didn   t have to have a teaching degree, as such. She qualified to be a  teacher and she taught. She used the money to help Grandma and the  girls, as she called them. Grandma told me the story of one Christmas,  there was no presents, there was nothing. Lema stood and it was  snowing and cold. She stood by the window and watched for a wagon  that was going to town. She got on the wagon and went to town. She had  a dollar, but she found three things for a dollar and rode in the wagon  back home in the snow, so when the girls woke up, they   d have  something for Christmas. That   s just a marvelous way to be, in my  opinion.  So Lema taught and then Irene got old enough, she got to be sixteen,  seventeen, and Lema said that it was now her turn. That Lema had found  a man, Wheeler. Uncle Wheeler. His name was Robert Wheeler, she  always called him Wheeler. She wanted to get married, Irene didn   t want  to. But she did. That   s the kind of responsibility you come from in my  opinion. There   s just an environment of everybody works. You don   t  really think about it and you don   t really have to be told. You just  understand that it   s a wonderful thing to have a job. It   s a wonderful  thing to be responsible for your family if they need something, but I  don   t think now-a-days we all live in the same house anymore. Like we  all lived in Grandma   s or you send the children off to another  grandmother if necessary. Everybody just understands that you work.  Was going to school important growing up?  Very. It was very important. Everybody was absolutely thrilled I got a  scholarship. We didn   t have enough money to send me. I got my first job  at twelve.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaixyn  Owens  Doing what?  Drug store. I lied about my age, but I was tall. I seemed older. I didn   t  have a social security card and they believed me. I went to work at  Robinson Brothers Drug at 36th and Western and loved it. I caught the  Britton bus home. Here   s the thing, this wasn   t the    30s, though. I caught  the Britton bus home, I got off work at 11:00, the bus came by at 11:30,  so I sat on the curb on Western and caught the midnight bus home. You  couldn   t do that now. You wouldn   t let a child do it. No one ever  accosted me or said a cross word. Going to school was very important.  Graduating was wonderful.  Was it hard to balance working and going to school?  I never had a moment   s trouble. No. I loved school. I liked working even  better than school. What happened was, a teacher changed my life,  really. She came to Britton High School, Fern Smith. I was in the    You  could hear me out in the hall. I have a great big voice. So I was in the  junior play, which was, believe it or not in those days a minstrel show.  She was in the audience, she came to school to teach shorthand and I  was in her class. She discovered I wasn   t learning shorthand. I sat in the  back and made up my own little system just to get through. So she took  some interest in me. At the end of that minstrel show, she caught me  back stage and said,    I   m coming back next year as a speech teacher and  you   re going to be my star pupil.    And she did, and I was, and that   s  how the scholarship came about, so I could go to Central State. That just  changed my life. Wonderful woman. But yes, it was important.  I just want to go back a little bit to the oil fields.  Sure.  When you moved to the oil field community, was it a tight knit group of  people?  Yes. You went to each other   s birthday parties. I remember that. I  remember the children all played together. I was in first grade when we  were there, I was six. So it was first or second. Mother got me in early  because they weren   t that strict, so when we were back on 32nd and  Edgemere was there, she got me enrolled and I shouldn   t have been for a  year, but I got through. So I don   t remember the group, but for instance  we had a school play and I was Little Miss Muffet in a yellow crepe  dress with the spider. Don   t like them to this day. It was, yes, a fairly  tight knit group. I think we left, it wasn   t that the jobs all dried up, but  they had a terrible accident on Daddy   s rig. The guy was up in the top of  the tower, I forgot what they call it, and they shoot that pipe up and it  15  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  exploded and he was killed. I think that got to Daddy and we left. I  really think that   s what it was. That   s when we left and went to Capitol  Hill. I told you my experience there was going to the fair. I had been told  about vaccinations. If you get a little of something, you get over it. I was  very ticklish. So in my child head, I thought, I could get over being  ticklish. So I played with this group of kids and I told the guys,    I want  you to hold me down and tickle me and no matter what I say, don   t let  me up.    They did. I am extraordinarily ticklish to this day. (Laughter)  Didn   t work.  It didn   t work. It did not work. It was terrible. The other thing, in  Cushing, the original    What is that story? Doctor and Mr. Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll?  Yes. Jekyll and Hyde. Original movie. Went to see the movie. The  adults are in the other room. They   re not paying any attention to me. I go  in the kitchen, I climb up on the cabinet, I get a glass, I got all the stuff  out of the cabinets and I put some of it in the glass and I climb down and  I put water in it and I drank it    It didn   t take an hour that I became very  sick and they couldn   t figure out what in the Sam Hill.    What   s the  matter? She just was in the kitchen and now she   s       I didn   t own up to  it until I got older, being so violently ill, but I wanted to see if I could  make up a potion and be somebody else.  Would your mom or grandma have home remedies when you got sick?  Oh, yeah. You had soda if your stomach was upset. You   d mix up soda  and drank that. My Grandmother Lizzy, I have no idea why, but if you  got like a bad cut or something, and I did often, she poured bluing in it.  Do you know what bluing is? It came in a bottle and it was literally blue,  called bluing, you poured it in the wash    You didn   t have a washing  machine in those days, but she had a scrub board and a tub and you   d  put bluing in and it made the clothes whiter. For some reason, I don   t  know why, she would pour bluing in it. It would look blue and odd and I  don   t think it worked, but we got over it, whatever it was. (Laughs)  Growing up, what was bath time like?  Bath time?  Yes.  You had to take turns of course in Grandma Lizzy   s house because there  was so many of us. You knew your place. If you were the little one,  16  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  somebody bathed you. If you got old enough, you just took your turn.  The girls all wanted in the bathroom.  And you had indoor plumbing?  Yes, yes. We did. I don   t recall ever having    Well, once we visited  Leonard in Texas and he grew wheat. He had a big wheat farm. He was  just beginning, it was in the    30s. He had outdoor plumbing. Grandma  Lily said to me,    Let   s don   t go in there.    (Laughter) We didn   t, we  went out behind. We didn   t go in there. Terrible. But that   s my only  experience with outdoor plumbing.  You finally settled in     Britton. But that was in 1942, when the war happened. When Pearl  Harbor happened, we were living in Warr Acres. That was our little time  to try mother not working. That was a ghastly mistake.  Well, when the Depression was going on, could you tell that the  Depression was going on?  No, I couldn   t. I wasn   t old enough. I know they could, but I was a  youngster. I was in the middle of a bunch of teenagers, is what it  amounted to. My dad, he was twenty when I was born. So all his  siblings    Jimmy is only six and a half years older than I am. Jimmy  took me down the street to Bob Rose   s and put boxing gloves on me and  said I needed to learn to defend myself. Of course, I got hit in the nose. I  took the gloves off and went home. But I am in the middle of a bunch of  kids who had rubber guns. I didn   t like rubber guns. They hurt. But we  played. We were all just outside playing a lot. The adults, of course,  knew the Depression was on and they were struggling. That   s why there  were all those people living in that house. But they shared and I   m sure  it was out of necessity, but they never let it trickle down to the kids. You  never were hungry. You probably didn   t have two pairs of shoes, but  nobody had two pairs of shoes.  Would your mom sew?  No, my mother was a terrible housewife. Bless her sweet heart. She  worked herself half to death keeping us clothed and fed, but when my  brother went off to the National Guard, he wrote a letter home that   s a  classic to us. He sincerely said,    Momma, I   m so homesick for some of  your burned pork chops.    (Laughter) We all understood. She was not a  cook. One time, when we had our little adventure where Momma  doesn   t work, she made me a sun dress, which I wore (I went to Putnam  City at that time) to Putnam City, and discovered when I went to the  17  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  restroom, I couldn   t get out of it without taking it all off. (Laughs) There  were no buttons, there was nothing. She didn   t think about it, she just  sewed up this wonderful thing and put me in it and I couldn   t get out. So  that was Momma. She did not sew and she didn   t cook worth a darn, but  she worked her heart out keeping us all fed.  Did you ever hear the adults talk about Roosevelt?  Oh, yeah. I thought there was no other president. I really thought he had  always been there, he would always be there. My mother took me to see  him. He came through town on his first campaign tour, evidently.  They   d get out on the back of the train, so everybody went down to see  Roosevelt. Momma lifted me up to see and I shouted,    It   s George  Washington     which embarrassed her terribly. But I knew it was a  president and I knew that name belonged to    But I couldn   t believe  when he died. Then when Wendell Willkie came along and the  neighborhood was divided, people began to wear Wendell Willkie  buttons, but in my family he was a saint. Roosevelt, if it hadn   t been for  the WPA, Papa would have not had as many jobs as he did and I don   t  know what we would have done. Because the WPA gave him work, it  wasn   t charity. It was work. Good honest work. So as far as my family  was concerned, he could do no wrong. I think a great many people felt  that way. Then, of course, the war came along.  What were some of the WPA projects?  Roads. What did Papa do? There was something he did with the water  systems, I don   t remember what that was. But I do know he worked on  the roads. They laid brick. That   s all I really know. I don   t know what he  did.  Would you, as a family, listen to the Fireside Chats?  Yes, we did. That   s what I meant on the radio. When Roosevelt spoke,  Joe Lewis fought, or the Grand Ole Opry was on, those three things.  Saturday night was the Grand Ole Opry. Whenever Roosevelt spoke, we  listened. And Joe Lewis. That   s why it was so hard to believe when he  died, Roosevelt. He was just a fixture. It was like, he just always was.  Things were tough for your family in those early years. Was there ever  any thought of leaving Oklahoma?  Not for any of the grandparents. My dad and mother, when I was about  right at a year, Daddy got this little old car, the Model-T thing, the three  of us took off for California. Going to be Okies, go to California. Daddy  was going to play golf and get a job with one of the country clubs. When  18  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  they got to about as far as the desert, they ran out of money. So they  always teased me that they fed me orange soda pop instead of milk  because they didn   t have the money for milk. They always said that if  they hadn   t done that, I could have been tall. I would have grown up and  been tall. They teased about that. There were no jobs. He couldn   t get a  job anywhere, so they came back. As far as I know, that was the last  attempt until everybody was grown and the kids began to scatter.  Would your mom ever teach you any tricks she learned in the beauty  shop?  No, I   m hopeless. My brother and sister can take care of hair, I cannot.  My mother could crochet. I tried to learn. She was going to teach me and  she said,    Honey, why don   t you just give it up?    Which I did. I don   t  have those skills.  Are there any lessons that your grandparents or your parents just really  tried to instill in you from those Depression years?  I think it is you work. It is honorable to work. It is honorable to earn a  decent living. You have loyalty to your employer. Your employer has  loyalty to you. I think that   s gone. I think youngsters, understandably,  have lots of different jobs. You don   t just stick with a company  anymore. People used to stay with companies years untold. You got  pensions and such. Not that they don   t now with the Google   s and the  large corporations. People are more likely to have their own business.  But I think probably the difference is that there were jobs. Across the  street, a woman taught piano. Someone down the street kept babies  while people went to work. So up the street, a block up on 32nd, there  was a woman who made donuts and her husband carried them in little  baskets, one on each arm, and he would walk the neighborhood selling  the donuts. I would ask him when I saw him when I was little,    Where  did you come from?    and it was just up the street. So she and I became  fast friends. I would go sit on the table while she made donuts and I  would    I guess they were the original donut holes. She would just have  a few that I happened to get.  It was the value of things. You weren   t so proud that    False pride about  things. Do you know Harding? It was a high school and now it   s a  school for youngsters for music and special things. Well, Harding in  those days was just a nice big high school. On Friday nights, they would  have movies for a nickel and adults would go and kids would go because  you could go down in their basement and they set up an auditorium-like  thing. They ran movies, Blondie and Dagwood, the Three Stooges, all  those wonderful movies, and it was a nickel. So people like my mother  and dad or grandpa, they could go to the movie. They couldn   t go  19  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  downtown and go to the movie. No. I think the lesson was you helped  people. People were good to you.  I went to a movie once down on Paseo, I don   t know if you know the  Paseo district, it   s an art district now, but there used to be a big movie  theater there. I lost my dime and my dime was the only way I had to get  home. I   m standing there in the back of this movie theater and I   m not  ten years old. These two lovely women asked me what was the matter  and I explained and they gave me a dime. That kind of thing. I   ve never  forgotten that. I   ve always felt like that dime needs to go to other folk. I  think that   s the kind of thing you learned then. It wasn   t that you didn   t  have a dime, it was that someone was willing enough to trust you. A  dime doesn   t sound like much, does it?  But back then     It was the difference, was I going home or was I stuck? It was too far to  walk and it was night. I could get on the streetcar and go home if  somebody gave me a dime. To me, that   s a concrete example of how  things work. You stopped a car if you saw somebody stuck, you stopped.  You don   t stop anymore. The last time I stopped and picked up a man,  my family had a screaming fit.    What are you doing     but it was just, I  didn   t think about it, I just stopped. He   s walking out, it   s hot, it   s  miserable, you stop.  I   m guessing your grandparents and parents probably picked up  hitchhikers     Yes. You stopped and you helped people. To this day, I propose nothing,  I guess, except in Wyoming if you see anybody out because it   s so far  out, you stop and pick them up. In Oklahoma City, you wouldn   t dare.  And that   s a shame. I don   t know what changed. I have a hunch, but I  just think there are too many of us.  You told me your first job was at the age of twelve.  Yes.  And you lied about your age.  Right.  That   s during the 1940s. Was that the only job you had? Or did you  work other places?  Oh, no, gosh. I worked at the Ritz Theater in Britton. I worked at the  20  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  McLemore Drug Store in Britton. I worked at the Britton Drug. That   s  about it in Britton, I think. I worked at John A. Brown   s. Then, of  course, I went off to school and I worked in the library there and in the  dorm.  Where did you go to school?  Central State.  That   s right.  Before it was University of Central  Oklahoma , it was Central State.  There were about 1,000 students there. I started in September of 1949.  You were in the last class at Britton High?  There were thirty-five of us and we were the last graduating class. They  tore it down and it became John Marshall.  Well, tell me about the old school. What was it like?  It was two stories, brick, built the old fashion style where you go up the  front steps. Everybody knew everybody. There were favorite teachers,  Lucille Shirk, her brother was the mayor of Oklahoma City for a while,  George Shirk. He was the one who stopped them from knocking down  all the old buildings like the Concord, when the PEI plant came around.  They would not level everything. He got on the crane and went up on the  building and stopped them. That got a lot of attention, so people didn   t  knock all the buildings down, the pretty old ones. She taught English.  Mrs. Boren taught history. Everybody could be a cheerleader if you  wanted to. The Britton Bears, I don   t think we ever won a football game.  Band class. I remember when it came time for algebra, the first algebra  class, the teacher had run off and eloped. So the assistant principle  taught us applied math. I never learned math, but they just passed us  because there was no teacher and they couldn   t afford to hire another  one. The only reason that mattered is when you got to college and you  were supposed to take this orientation exam, when I got to the math  portion, I simply flipped over. I didn   t even bother to look at it. I almost  didn   t get in. I only got in because the debate coach got me in.  Well, you said your speech teacher was     Fern Smith.  Played a big role in your life.  21  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  She changed my life.  Changed your life.  Because I   m sure I probably wouldn   t have gone to college. We couldn   t  afford to send me.  How did she tell you about Central State?  Her husband lived in Edmond and was an associate coach for the  football team. I was offered a scholarship to OU, to OSU and a couple of  other schools, but we couldn   t afford that. Even with the scholarship, we  couldn   t afford that. I had won all the things you could win, so I was  offered a lot of scholarships. The only one we could afford was at  Central State. The reason they knew about me was principally Fern. I  could afford that one. I drove all the way to Edmond all by myself. I  laugh because that sounds so odd, but it was all the way to Edmond and  all by yourself with your bags packed in the back of your car. I was so  scared that I drove around that little campus about three or four times  before I ever parked and went in. I was so scared, but it was wonderful.  Was that your first car?  Wasn   t my car. No, that was Momma   s car.  Momma   s car.  That was Momma   s car.  Did you get to take Momma   s car to college with you?  No, no, no, no. I drove it up. She was working, so there wasn   t anybody  to go with me. So we put my bags in the back of the car and off I went.  Then when I got settled, I went back and she drove me back and she  went home with the car.  So how often would you go home?  Never.  Never.  Once in a rare while. It was a long way to Edmond, and I didn   t own a  car and Mother only had hers, so no, I didn   t go home.  What was your major at Central State?  22  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Speech. With a minor in education because my mother said you need to  be a school teacher. School teachers always have a job. They have an  honorable profession. You need to be a school teacher.  Is that what you did?  I tried one year. I am not a school teacher. (Laughter) I   m not. I admire  school teachers. I come from a family of Lema and Irene school  teachers, loved education and school and I venerate school teachers. But  I think it   s a talent, just like anything. It   s its own unique talent. I could  debate. I couldn   t tell you how to. That was the difference. If you  couldn   t do it, I was baffled. Because I told you what I thought would  make a difference, but it didn   t. So I taught for a year at Northwest, a  class of speech and debate. I   m not a teacher.  So you realized teaching is probably not a good fit.  No, no it   s not a good fit. (Laughter)  What did you end up doing?  Advertising. That was a fit. When I was going to Central State, I got a  job at KTOK as a disc jockey. I worked four to midnight. Again, I lied. I  was working at John A. Brown   s in the advertising department and this  nice woman, Sue Peck, took me to one of their Ad-Club meetings and  she introduced me to Tom Johnson. He was the station manager for  KTOK. In those days, it wasn   t a talk station. It was music, just like all  radio was. She said,    You need to talk to this young woman. She   s blah,  blah, blah.    So we visited and he said to me,    Do you know how to work  a board?    I said,    Oh, yes.    Thinking, what   s a board? He said,    Well,  why don   t you stop by the station and we will see if we can   t fit you in.  I   ve been thinking about hiring a woman. That would be very different.     So I went by the station and this lovely man who was program director  there, Bill Thompson, it didn   t take him five minutes. He said,    You  don   t have a clue, do you?    I said,    No, I don   t.    Turns out the board, of  course, is the control board. It   s how you work the control board and in  those days, of course, the turn tables and the microphone and riding the  game and stuff, it didn   t take me long to catch on. So they hired me. At  first it was in the mornings. That didn   t work out because I was  supposed to open the station like at four in the morning and I   m no good  at that anymore than I am at teaching school. I was always about fifteen  minutes late. I hate being late. So they moved me to the evening. I  worked four to midnight. I really enjoyed it.  There were not many women in broadcasting then.  23  Owens  Very few. Very, very few. It was very unusual. But I really liked it. It  was fun. I won   t bore you with all, but people call in with all these odd  stories and odd things happen. We ran the Billy Graham Hour on  Sunday nights. I introduced the Billy Graham show. The phone would  start ringing and people were calling to say to me,    How dare you call it  a show? It   s a program. It   s not a show.    I always wondered,    What   s  the matter with people? Why do you get so upset over absolutely  nothing?    But it   s pretty fun to listen to them and find out what their  complaints are. Whatever. But I worked that job for quite a while. Then  I graduated and I got an opportunity in Odessa, Texas, at KECK and I  went there. What happened was    This sounds like I   ve lied my whole  life, but I haven   t    A lot. I went there on a job opportunity and it  wasn   t working out. So the guy from KECK, their copywriter, continuity  (which it   s called continuity at the station, you write the copy) had left,  her husband got transferred. They were leaving the next day, he thought.  They had turned me down for a job that I thought I had. So he came over  and he said,    Do you know continuity?    And I said,    Yes.    So he said,     Great, we need a continuity person.     So I showed up the next day and this woman of course said,    Do you  know what continuity is?       No.    So she said,    The salesman will go out  and he will sell the department store, the white sale. He   ll come back  and say,    I need scripts for the announcers to sell this product, here.        She said,    That   s what you   ll do. They have to be sixty seconds in length  and here   s the typewriter. And wait for the salesman,    and she left. She  told me there on the file cabinet, there were these books and they   re  called idea starters. Here comes the salesman and sure enough, he had  sold the department store and he dumps on the desk, here it is, towels  this much, and leaves. I sat there a minute and I thought,    Listen, if I  pick up one of those books, I   ll never know if I can do it. Never know.     So I thought,    Just think what you   d say.    I loved the job and the job  loved me.  The only trouble in those days, you couldn   t get on the air. You could  about some women   s something, but that didn   t come along very often.  But as a continuity writer, you could do well. So then they came to town  and they built KMOD-TV. It was the first television station in West  Texas and they asked around about who writes good copy. Well, Lanora  Owens. They offered me a job and you talk about fun. I wrote the copy,  I kept the logs, I had a cooking show. I did. I had a thirty minute daily  cooking show. (Laughs) That   s all women could do. I could talk, but I  can   t cook. No way on earth I can cook. So we had one camera and one  boom mic, that   s all we had. They didn   t have wireless mics, there  wasn   t such a thing. And we didn   t have tape, everything was live.  Television gets fun when it is live.  24  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  So there I was in this kitchen and I had this first sponsor was this guy  who sold appliances. The big deal was they had this new oven that came  out and you could take the door off and clean it and then put the door  back on. No sweat. So I do my little cooking thing, my little talk and I  tell them about the oven. I take the oven door off and I, wonderful, clean  it    I can   t get the fool thing back on. I cannot. I   m not terribly  mechanical. I couldn   t make it hook. That got me tickled because it is  funny to see me standing there trying to hook this fool oven door back  on. So I put the oven door down and I turn to the camera and said,     Well, we   ll take care of that another time.    He fired me on the spot as  soon as I was off the air. He was no longer my sponsor.  Everything was fine and the next sponsor, they do these mixes. All kinds  of mixes. So I get in the kitchen and I take one of his mixes and I mix it  up and I put it in the oven. The oven had a glass door, and I peek in and I  think, I   ve hit a winner. I   ve done it. So I tell the cameraman, come look  at this beautiful cake. Open the oven door. I pull out the rack, the cake is  standing up that tall, I don   t know it   s not supposed to. It   s enormous.  As I pull out the rack, the whole top of the cake slides off and down and  across the oven door and onto the floor because I had put in baking  powder and not baking soda, or the other way around, whichever it is.  So I lost that sponsor. (Laughs)  Live TV.  Oh, it was wonderful. People got fired right and left. One poor guy, we  had a thing called Melmac. Do you remember? You   re too young.  You   re all too young. But there was this dinnerware stuff that came out  called Melmac. This was in the early    50s. Unbreakable. Absolutely  unbreakable. So the poor guy comes out and he sets a whole table in the  studio. It looks beautiful, he   s got this big tablecloth. The floor is  concrete. One camera, all live.    Watch this.    Like a magician, jerks that  table cloth. Melmac flies everywhere, hits the floor, the camera is  watching, it shatters into a hundred pieces. He was fired. God, I wish I  could remember the guy   s name. He and I shared a show that was an  interview show in the afternoon. He also had another show, which was  with kids. One afternoon, this little kid threw up on him. He said to me,     Lanora, I can   t do this anymore.    He said,    I met Jose Ferrar and he  said if I ever got to Los Angeles to look him up. My wife and I are  going.    And they went. Sure enough, he was the guy in Get Smart, the  boss. What the devil was his name? Ed  Edward Platt , I   ve gone blank  on his last name, I apologize. He was in Rebel Without a Cause. He  really went and he really did extremely well, which was very nice. So  that was my stint in live television. I came back here and     25  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  What brought you back to Oklahoma?  I worked all the time and I got sick. I worked    I had two shows a day. I  did all the copy for everybody else. I didn   t take care of myself at all. I  didn   t eat, I didn   t sleep, I didn   t do anything. I got sick. So I came back  to rest and recoup, which I did. Then, I   m trying to think, what did I do?  Oh, I called around looking to maybe go to work with an ad agency. I  got introduced    Couldn   t get a job. I went to work for a place called  Country Club Publications and it was a woman who started it because  her mother had a bad stroke, her dad was not employed, and she started  the company and took care of them. She did very well. She had the  Oklahoma City Country Club and Twin Hills. Later, she had several in  Texas. But it was a very small operation and I learned how to paste up  and use the drafting board and all that sort of thing, and I wrote articles  and things for Country Club Publications. One of the clubs was the  Petroleum Club. The Petroleum Club hired me away from her to do,  they wanted their own publication. They wanted me to do that.  So I went to work for them and from there, their publication committee,  a couple of the guys tried to hire me. One, at the bank. They wanted me  to be a banker. Lowe Runkle, he had a very large ad agency. He hired  me. A member of the bank said,    Lanora, you could make as much as   13,000 a year.    That was big stuff, for a woman especially. I remember  Lowe Runkle said,    You   ll probably never make that much, but you   ll  like it better here.    So I stuck with Lowe Runkle and I loved it. I  absolutely loved it. We were the largest ad agency in Oklahoma, in the  whole area for a while. We had everybody. We had Kerr McGee,  Liberty, OG+E, all the big companies, Macklanburg-Duncan, we had all  of them. I loved that. I did a lot of on camera work. I was the  spokesperson on camera for OG+E and C.R. Anthony, a lot of  advertisers. I remember being told I couldn   t do the bank because the  president said,    I   d love for you to, but no one would believe a woman  talking about money.    Isn   t that wonderful? At one point, someone said,     The next president of this organization should be Lanora Owens.     Someone said,    Don   t be ridiculous. A woman can   t be president of a  large company.     It   s odd how you just chip away and chip away and they   ll let you do all  the work that makes a success, but they   re very reticent about  acknowledging you might actually be in charge. Now, happily, that   s  changed and is changing. So finally, Howard Neumann was president of  Lowe Runkle and he was the guy who started the first coach   s show in  America with Bud Wilkinson. Then he went on and he did the coach   s  show through Switzer and then he and I went out and started Owens-  Neumann. Howard passed away about eleven years ago and I still have  Owens-Neumann. Contrary to all my family   s wishes, I haven   t retired  26  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  yet. I   ve only got three accounts, but that   s all I want. I don   t take new  business. I do all of Bob Mills Furniture business, I write and produce  his television and his print and all that. Mitchener-Farrand Jewelers, and  Pull-A-Part, which is a used auto parts yard.  With a catchy jingle. Pull-A-Part     Yes, thank you. I named them. Pull-A-Part. (Laughter) It seemed logical.  That   s what you do. You go to the auto parts yard and it   s cheaper  because you pull them, is our little slogan. The name seemed logical to  me, Pull-A-Part, and it has been. They   ve had a lot of people try to buy  the name from them. So here I am.  It   s been a good life.  It has. It has. I   ve had lots of fun. I   ve been in copper mines, uranium  mines, off-shore drilling rigs. I   ve had some wonderful and strange  adventures in those places. Especially in the uranium mine. That   s a  trek, but it is fun. Again, always the only woman. Guys were always  nice. Always.  What   s special about Oklahoma to you? You could go anywhere, you   ve  been other places. Why do you continue to remain in Oklahoma?  CBS offered me a job in 1970-something,    77, I think it was. They flew  me to New York, met me at the airport in a limousine. These two guys,  one nice and one was the kind of fellow, he said to me,    Why wouldn   t  you want to be here? Everything happens here. You live where nothing  happens. Why do you want to live where nothing happens? Everything  happens in New York.    He was probably right. He was off to the  Hamptons and got me to the hotel and I was to have an audition the next  day. The guy who was nice, he picked me up the next morning. He gave  me a book to look at and I did an audition, interviewed a guy who was  convinced that all of your   what   s your birth sign?  Leo.  Leo? Well, you   re wrong. The reason you   re wrong is because Leo was  a birth sign eons ago when they first invented birth signs. Since that  time, the celestial heavens have moved. So his book is about the fact that  if you   re looking at Leo, you   re probably Scorpio. Kooky guy. The other  guy was a financial fellow. That was nothing. So anyway, afterwards we  had lunch and we had a really nice visit. He said,    We can get you an  apartment over here. You can have an apartment and it would be like  1,500 dollars a month, but it   s in a safe area and has a doorman.    It   s a  one bedroom, I mean it had an elevator, but I had a lovely home and a  27  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  swimming pool. I have really nice friends. I don   t need to worry about  doormen and security. Had I been twenty, I might have taken him up on  it. But I   m now early forties and there   s no place for me there. At least  not in my opinion. I wouldn   t live like that. Age made that a big  difference.  Where are your grandparents resting today?  Where are they? Well, I don   t know    I have an interesting set of    I  told you my mother   s father was a Baptist minister. Debated all over. I  had an odd experience about that. The Library Association asked me to  go around and do speeches for them some years back, and so I was in  like Henryetta and there was this room, group of all these people. I get  up on the podium and I do my bit, right? Then you meet people  afterward. This guy came up. He said,    I must tell you. I so enjoyed your  talk.    He said,    You know, I was sitting there listening to you and I   ve  only heard one other human who reached me like that.    I said,    Really?  Who was that?    He said,    Well, there was this minister.    It was my  grandfather. That gives me goose bumps to this day. He didn   t know. He  said,    Well, there was this minister. Reverend Smith.    I said,    Could his  name be Walter?       Walter Smith, yes, and he had daughters.       Well,  yes. That was my grandfather      So he   s in Spring Creek, Lily is in Cushing Cemetery. Papa and  Grandma are right outside Edmond, Memorial, I think it is, where  Mother and Daddy are too, as well. Lizzy   s parents, Sally and Raz  Cunningham, don   t you love that name? Raz Cunningham. I don   t know  where they are, but the wonderful story about them is that Raz was a  traveling salesman. I think that   s where the advertising comes from. Sell  them a little snake oil. He went through town and he met Sally. He  leaves. Sally falls in love, gets engaged. She   s sitting on her front porch  in a swing one day. Here comes Raz Cunningham. Later, he comes  through town, wants to see Sally. He stops. We all wish we knew what  he said to her. She left with him. She got on that wagon and left. And it  took    They had all kinds of kids, great family, we all    I would love to  go back and be able to say,    What did you say to her?    (Laughs) Isn   t  that a great story, though?  That   s wonderful.  It is. I said advertising is my natural calling. I   ve got a Baptist minister  over here and a traveling salesman over here. I can   t miss.  Well, is there anything else you   d like to tell us about?  Gosh, I don   t know if I   ve told you anything worth hearing.  28  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Oh, you   ve been great. I really appreciate your stories and your insight  into a lot of growing up in Oklahoma City. It   s just been wonderful.  I wish they   d kept the streetcars. Don   t you, though?  Oh, yeah.  But now, that Devon Tower? You talk about exciting. Things are  changing so, just wonderful.  It   s a good time to be in Oklahoma.  It   s a good time for you youngsters to be alive because you have the  social media, you   re all in touch with each other.  And I bet that   s changed advertising, too.  It   s going to. It   s going to be totally different. I don   t know what form it  will take. I know that most of print is gone. The media you buy is not  print much anymore. Some things, like The Gazette, because you have  such young readership, but print by and large is gone. The newspapers.  Social networking    Google has a thing, have you seen it now?  Google Plus.  Yeah, with that circle, so that    I just told Mitchener-Farrand I just  signed them up for a thing, they guarantee you get 750 fans in a week.  They run the campaign and it   s KFOR, and the reason they   re doing that  is that it   s a way, first of all, for us to buy your media. Secondly, that   s a  good benefit to the client because you need more fans on your Facebook  because some people do it extremely well. They mix in their retail with  things that make it interesting for you to read. I think that the retailers  who catch on to how to do that will do very well. I don   t know. I can   t  imagine what television commercials will be in another ten years. There  will be so many channels, how will you get an audience? How can you  tell me what the ratings are? How many channels can you watch right  now?  A whole lot. A whole lot.  Oh, lord. Yes. So how do I know how to find you?  Local news.  Local news. That   s the only way I know. That   s all I buy for like  29  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Nykolaiszyn  Owens  Mitchener-Farrand. Now Bob Mills has a huge budget, but for like for  Mitchener-Farrand, Pull A Part    And I   ll tell you what, on Pull A Part,  Spanish. Huge. Spanish radio got an enormous return. So I think Spanish  will be a big market. Already is growing. But I don   t    I   m sorry I  won   t be here to watch it. I would love to be part of it.  Any ideas of when you will retire? Or are you just going to keep going?  Well, I   ve got to. This is getting silly. (Laughs) I   m going to be eighty  years old in October. I don   t feel it.  You look great   Thank you. But I mean, it   s kind of    Advertising is supposed to be a  young person   s game and should be because    Aldous Huxley said it  best. He said,    Advertising and literature have absolutely nothing in  common.    He tried to be a copywriter for a while. It is, you have to  know what the current fads are, the clothes and the colors and the social  media and the network. You need to stay abreast of all that sort of thing.  But I enjoy it. My clients don   t want me to stop, so I don   t know. I   m  going to    One of my favorite places on earth is Carmel, California.  God, I love that place. So I   m going there in September for a month. I  will sit there by the ocean and I   m going to think it over and see if I  come back and think    I   ve been working since twelve. I   ve never been  without a job. Maybe I quit. See, at best you   ve got ten, right? I   ve got  friends now who are ninety and ninety-one. I figure I   ve got ten or  eleven years. As an adult, it would be nice to not work, but I   m not sure  what I   d do.  Write a book.  I don   t think so. I   m a copywriter. I don   t know that. I always wanted to.  I guess everybody wants to. Because books    And that comes I   m sure  from my reading. Books are the most precious thing. I don   t even have a  Kindle because I want to hold a book. I want to hold a book. I love  books. But I don   t think I   m an author. I think I write copy.  Well, thank you again for your time.  Oh, I enjoyed it just thoroughly.  -------  -------
