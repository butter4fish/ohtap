 Little Thunder  Littrell  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. I   m here on October 1, 2010, with  Doris Littrell. We   re at Doris    home and thank you Doris for taking the  time to interview with me.  Thank you for coming.  You are at least a third generation Oklahoman, as I understand. Would  you like to tell me where you grew up and a little bit about your family?  I grew up at Apache, Oklahoma. That   s the southwestern part of our  state, and we had eighty percent Native American people as I grew up  there. My best friend was an Indian girl, and my grandmother was part  Cherokee. They came from Tennessee through Arkansas, and on into  what was then Indian Territory. My grandmother married and had four  daughters. He  her husband  had a dray service, and he worked in all  kinds of weather. He had TB  tuberculosis , and the doctors told her he  should be taken to Pueblo, Colorado, and if that didn   t help then they   d  need to go on into Arizona. He lived three months, and she came back  with her four girls in a covered wagon. He had left her with some  money, so she bought a ranch outside of Apache, but also near the edge  of the Wichita  Mountains . She had cattle, and through the years she  met Mr. Cook, who lived on the farm adjoining her. His wife had died,  and they got married. He had four children, so she assisted in raising  them, and then they had five, and of those children, one was my mother.  It was near Cache Creek Mission and School, and a few miles outside of  Apache is a little community   it had a church and a store and a school.  It was called Boone, and when the Presbyterian church closed the school  at the Cache Creek Mission, then the Indian children were taken into  Boone. And those children and my grandmother   s children were the only  non-Indians. So my mother grew up with all Indian children in her  5  school, and that was brought into my life from that side of my family.  I went to Apache  high  school and I graduated high school there, but  when I was thirteen I went to my aunt. My mother   s sister owned the  telephone office in Apache, and I asked if I could live with her and go to  school and work for her. It was the Depression, she lived with her in-laws,  and there were no accommodations for me to live in, but she could  hire me. I worked nights. I went on the job at 9:00 at night, and there  was a night bell and so forth, and I could do some sleeping, and then I  could do some studying, and I was there until 7:00 in the morning. And  from the time school let out and before I went to work and on weekends,  I lived with this Comanche family who were parents of my good friend,  Betty. They were just very understanding of my working, and if I was  ever at school and needed to go home for any reason, through illness or  something, he just treated me like I was his own and he would be there  and do it. So I had that experience.  Then when I graduated, since I had gone to work so young for the  telephone company, I was waiting for my experience to be bridged to  Southwestern Bell in Oklahoma City. That was like 1949-50. I went to  work and I worked at night, and at four in the morning it was my lunch  hour, and I went to Bishop   s, which was a restaurant on Broadway and  Fourth, to have my lunch. I met Bob McCabe there, and we got  acquainted, and then in 1951 we were married. And in    52 we had our  first daughter, Toya, and then eighteen months later we had Kim. His  mother lived in San Diego, so every summer we would go to California  to visit her. When we went through Santa Clara Pueblo, we started  collecting black pottery from Santa Clara, and Navajo rugs. We had a  limited budget, so we would camp out, which we liked to do anyway,  and we saved our money by camping out to buy art. We bought pottery  and rugs, and then one day I said,    You know, the town I came from has  a lot of painters, why don   t we see what in Oklahoma we might do.     So we started buying Oklahoma painters in 1952, and it sort of passed  around through the Indian community that we were doing that. They  would call on us and ask if we wanted to buy things, and so that   s how  we started. I went to states   not so much into the East, more Colorado,  New Mexico, Arizona and California   and I called on museums and  galleries with the art. And that was a help to introduce Oklahoma Indian  art outside the state. But then, I thought, the thing that seemed to help in  marketing Native American art in Oklahoma was, in 1968, I went to the  Oklahoma Art Center. Imogene Mugg managed the museum gallery  at  the Center , and I asked if she would be interested  in Native art . She let  me consign some, and that was in March. In August she called, she said,     We don   t have a show in August, it   s too hot, no one will come, but  would you like it for your Indians?    I said,    I sure would.     6  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  So we started having these shows, and I would consign. I   d buy them;  the artist would get fifty percent, the Oklahoma Art Center received  thirty percent, Imogene Mugg worked for ten percent, and I worked for  ten percent. And after a time, she got acquainted with the painters and  she worked well with them. So I didn   t need to consign anymore. And it  was through her they learned to market by consignment, and invitational  shows, which she did for fourteen years. Instead of just buying and  selling, it was a very important thing for the artists to learn how to  handle that part of their career. Then I, with my husband Bob, opened  the Oklahoma Indian Art in 1979.  Was that your first gallery then?  That was the first retail business that I had had. I   d always traveled and  been a wholesaler. And so I had now a retail business with him, but we  had done some printing, and he really wanted to be in the print business,  and I didn   t. So he took the print business, I took the gallery. Then he  became an independent art dealer, dealing with painters other than the  ones that I dealt with. I did that until 2010, September, and I retired at  eighty-two from the gallery. But at home now, I have Merlin Little  Thunder and Robert Taylor. I broker their art because I have been with  them eighteen to twenty years, and have a fairly vast, established market  for their work. And their patrons would ask me,    Well, where can we  find their work?    So I   m going to show that at my home. Plus, if  collectors have things that they would like me to sell   the older art,  which I worked with in the beginning   I have a close feeling to that,  and some customers for it, so I   ll be doing that as well here at home. I  was reluctant   that   s the reason I worked so many years     to ever quit, because I   ve had such a good feeling and so much fun. I  always felt so rich that I could make a living at something I love so  much, so I just will continue at home. But it   s nice to be home, too,  because I   m domestic and I garden, so I have the best of both.  Well that   s a wonderful overview of your career, Doris. I   d like to go  back and expand upon a few things. I   m really curious about how you  first got interested in art. Whether you had art at school, or your first  experience was indeed seeing a piece of Indian art. How did you get  interested when you were young?  Mother   s brother, my uncle Everett, took me to pow-wows and things  when I was very small. He was in school with Allan Houser and Spencer  Asah, and later neighbored close by George Geionety. And Mr.  Geionety visited my uncle a lot, and he would have paintings on the  wall, unframed, and he would just put them up with push pins. I would  like those, and sometimes he would say yes, I could buy them. So he  would pay Mr. Geionety whatever he paid him, and then he would mark  7  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  them up fifty cents and sell them to me.  (Laughs) How old were you then? Is that when you were working?  Well, eighteen.  Eighteen?  Eighteen. So that was my first awareness of Native American painting,  but the Indians    ways, I had been living with the Comanches and Uncle  Everett had shown me how fun it was to know them, and Mother, her  friends were Indian people. So that was very easy for me, too. But as a  very young child, I felt close to color. I was allowed, in my childhood, to  dream. My sister could paint cabinets and build cellar doors and do all  that   I could do none of that. We lived on a farm, we were farmers. And  the cows were always supposed to be treated gently, so they allowed me  to do that. That was my job, to drive in the cows for milking, because I  would dream so long that they were well tended. When I was five, my  mother sent me to what we called    expression lesson classes    then, and I  went to a little school outside of Apache called Broxton, before I started  to school. I   d give readings at these, and they were usually humorous  readings, and the audience would laugh, and I would think that   s pretty  fun. So I think I was accustomed to talking to people, which has to do  with selling art. But also, there was a kinship in all of this with feeling  color. I really felt color. I remember thinking as I   d walk, how many  ways could I think to use pink. I wasn   t a painter, but I felt art things.  That   s really interesting.  And that   s how I think it started. And then, of course, it went into  an  interest in  Native  art  because innately they are such strong colorists. I  acquainted myself with that early on. I saw, no matter how untrained or  anything, that there was a dignity in their use of color.  I think your cultural exposure and familiarity with the different cultures  of Southern Plains comes through. You had mentioned in an interview  your family   s closeness may not have been typical, and Indians weren   t  always well treated in that part of the country. I wonder if you ever felt  any of that was deflected on you because you were friends with so many  Indian people. Were you ever conscious of     Oh, from the very beginning. Way young, much younger than, as I  reflect on it, you would think a youngster would feel that, but I did. As  Betty and I, my Indian friend, would walk down the street in Apache  going to her home from school, we had to pass a pool hall. The guys  would stand out there and call her    Squaw,    and I would go up to them  8  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  and offer to fight them. I was going to hit them, and she   d say,    Oh, just  don   t pay any attention.    But we were in the fifth grade. That   s why I  was so close to my mother and my grandmother, and her side of the  family, because that other side of my family was more like the people in  Apache. You could have someone like Doc Tate, who   s very famous,  the only Indian person who ever played at Carnegie Hall, and they didn   t  know any of that. They didn   t know that he was a great painter among  them. That always bothered me that they were so prejudiced against  Indians. That   s why I say it was eighty percent Indian, but that twenty  percent that wasn   t, was very strong against them.  I don   t know why I first wanted to know  Betty  when we were, like, in  the second grade. But I know very early on I regretted  how Indians  were treated.  I didn   t feel that had to be. And so that   s been in my life  the whole time, but it didn   t have anything to do with me trying to  market  Indian art . I tried to look at the value of each individual person  and how they might grow, and how indeed they did grow. And if they  remained a painter, they just got better and better and better. So I learned  like that. There was always that kinship that made it joyful to work with  the painters, and joyful to work with the collectors that bought their  work, because they were so close to it, like I was. And so you had it  coming and going, just a lovely love affair both ways.  Both relationships.  Yes.  It was in 1956 when you and Bob decided, as I understood it from  another interview, it was your idea, of    let   s start collecting some  Oklahoma Indian paintings.    That wasn   t happening a lot yet, was it?  Oh, there were hardly any persons  collecting . That   s why I traveled  and went out of state. I don   t like to think that Oklahomans won   t buy  now, because they do. But that took a lot of loving and caring, and the  artists availing themselves of invitationals, where they were awarded  awards for the finer blue ribbon winners and so forth. It just grew until it  became introduced to more and more Oklahomans. And now I don   t like  to hear that they won   t buy, because they do buy, but when we started,  there was a very narrow market.  And you had been, previously, as you explained, collecting Santa Clara  pottery and Navajo weaving     But that was just to take home.  But there   s kind of a learning process involved in just the collecting  9  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  part.  Yes.  I wonder if you could talk about that. You actually have expertise in a lot  of different areas, partly because of that collecting process.  It   s true. I ended up, our name was Oklahoman Indian Art Gallery, and  that was my primary item to market was the painters    work from our  state. But I did love it all, and do today. Pots, and the baskets, and the  rugs, and the jewelry. The more you read about it, and let dealers who  dealt in that, like I dealt in the paintings, talk to me, and explain who the  finer potters were, or what made this rug be a finer rug than that rug. I  learned from people who were marketing. Not so much that I knew  Navajo weavers, but I knew the people that dealt in their work, and they  taught me. Of course, today I was reading a book on Navajo rugs. I  never tire of reading about all of it. The only thing I never collected was  Kachinas. That   s a whole other thing. Nor did I carry them in the gallery  because they were so hard to ship. But a lot of galleries in the Southwest  do carry Navajo dolls and Hopi Kachinas.  Can you describe the kinds of paintings that you started out collecting in  the mid-fifties with Bob, in terms of Oklahoma Indian painters?  Well, at that time, they were primarily very traditionally done, two-dimension,  no foreground or background. Most of the painters were still  expressing themselves in that manner, and I learned to love that. I still  do love it.  A lot of cultural information     Yes. If they painted a dancer, they knew all about that dancer, and so  everything about it was done correctly. And you could learn from it. But  also the very fact that they were painting something they knew made it  somehow end up  being  more history and ethnography, rather than for  art   s sake. That started to diminish as I worked years and years with it.  There was an artist named Bobby Hill,  aka  White Buffalo, who started  doing scenery. A lot of people didn   t want to encourage that, and  said,      Don   t buy that, because that   s not traditional.    But if we let them alone,  and let them go ahead and evolve into what was their natural makeup to  do, then I could see that, also, the Indianness was filled with it, their love  of the scenery and so forth. Merlin Little Thunder is an example of that.  He has a memory for any landscape that he has ever seen in his whole  life, and he can just pull that up and it comes through his mind to his  heart to his paper. It would   ve been so wrong to have ever said to him,     You mustn   t paint that.     10  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Which actually did happen, but not with you. You were known for  handling Doc Tate Nevaquaya   s work, a Comanche artist. I wonder if  you could tell me a little bit about your relationship with him.  Yes. First of all, he went to Apache school, he was my brother   s age. He  was younger than I am, but I knew him through school. And then his  parents both died within a few months of each other when he was  thirteen, and his brother Malcolm tried to keep the children together, but  it was not possible, so they sent Doc to Fort Sill Indian School. I didn   t  see him through those years, and I was in the gift shop at the Southern  Plains Museum in Anadarko, and we were buying art, and I looked over  and I saw this miniature, maybe two by three inches, and it was a  Comanche couple on horses. Rosemary Ellison was the curator, and I  said to Rosemary,    Who did that?    and she said,    Well, it   s Doc Tate  Nevaquaya.    And I said,    I didn   t know he painted. Where does he  live?    She said,    Well, there   s his wife standing right there, ask her.     That was Rosemary   s way.  And so I introduced myself to Charlotte, and he lived where he   d always  lived, in the Nevaquaya land, and so we went down to see him. It had  started raining, and the property was on a non-graveled road off of the  main road, and so Bob sort of drove where he could, and then he  stopped, and I walked through the mud up to Doc   s house to see him and  introduced myself again. He had four paintings, and I bought them, and  he always said that he hadn   t really decided that he was going to be a  painter. But since I liked all four of them, and bought them, he thought  he   d just keep on painting, and he   d be a painter. And so there was that  closeness there. I handled him from   he always said    58 but I thought it  was    60   but it was in that time, until he died in 1996. And, of course,  he made flutes, and played flutes, and was famous for that, probably  more than painting because there were so few flute players and makers  at that time. He was always so professional. It was just a pure joy to deal  with that man and to know him.  I like hearing that because, of course, he tells the funny story about you  coming through the mud in your high heels, so elegant, but you actually  had a lot of history. And it   s the fact that you valued those paintings, and  were buying them, that partly encouraged him to go ahead. Not just  anybody, but in particular, you.  I think that somehow he knew that I was going to always be marketing.  We just knew, and so,  were  having such a fine relationship with him,  and such a comfortable and a happy time. Bob also   they enjoyed each  other a lot. It just was a nice foundation to start dealing with more and  more painters.  11  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  He was painting in the flat style, somewhat, but he was also innovating,  wasn   t he?  Yes.  In what ways?  He started putting in foreground and background. The things that I had  purchased at first were two-dimensional dancers, and he went away from  that. His horses were naturalistic, and they were still very much  traditional, in ways. It was like blocks of color. In a snow, it was blocks  of whites and grays that seemed very traditional. But at the same time he  had gone on to more than just two-dimensional, and that was fun to see  develop through the years. Mostly people who would buy his things  enjoyed both. One thing he was famous for, he and Archie Black Owl,  Cheyenne, were the only two that painted on black board. And there  were no erasures. You had to have a perfect hand for that. And he would  always play  music    Doc painted dancers only on black   and he  would always play dancer music while he was painting them, and they  were always inspired. He never repeated the same posture,  it  was  always different, a different pose of the dancer, when he painted. They  were always original. Even though it might be the Comanche fancy  dancer, it was always different. They took so much time, he couldn   t do  a lot of them, so there was always that feeling that it was non-commercial.  That   s neat to know. You mention Imogene   s show, the annual  invitational, and how it helped artists manage their careers because they  had to consign for that show. Were they also present for the show? Was  that a part of it, too?  Yes, they all attended. Since I didn   t own a gallery, and I worked as a  wholesaler, that was my first experience with watching them, and how  they attended shows, and enjoyed meeting the patrons that were buying.  It was just a joyous experience. She  Imogene  was very good with her  handling of the patrons and the artists, and when I was in town I would  always go. Not to work   I   d help if she needed help, but I didn   t work  for her. I just attended and observed how that was evolving, and later,  when I had my own gallery, I had shows all the time. One of the  purposes of that was so they could meet their patrons, and the patrons  would come because they wanted to see what they had created, fresh and  new, just for this opening. It was a lot of work on all our parts, but it was  always something that we all enjoyed.  Are there any highlight memories that you have about a particular  show? Numerous ones, probably     12  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Well, I didn   t do invitationals. So I never awarded  ribbons  after  Imogene was done with Native Americans at museum shows, and those  kinds of things. We just had a fun time with food and a certain period of  time to have them there. I remember that I never wanted to serve  anything alcoholic, because that seemed rude to me. Many of my artists  were in recovery, and I thought,    Well, why do that?    but it is, of course  the stylish thing to do, to serve wine and cheese, but no, I can   t  remember any in particular. They were all just fun.  (Laughs) I wanted to talk to you a bit about opening the gallery, because  as I understand from a previous interview, you took almost a year to  prepare for it. What were you     What was I doing?  What was the preparation involved?  Well, we had to notify the painters that we were going to do this, and  Oklahoma has never had a lot of Native American galleries. So we  selected a space that people thought was an odd space in south west   Oklahoma City. We leased from some people that we knew, who were  collectors. And we had the availability of a lot more floor space than we  could   ve had anywhere. And so it was a large gallery, and we opened  with forty painters.  That   s a huge amount of artists.  Yeah. Even with this, I think we opened with 4,000 square feet, but we  covered the front so the sun couldn   t come in and harm the art. It also  provided us, for these forty painters, with more wall space to hang. It  was in a strip shopping center, and as another little business closed, we  expanded. So at one point we had 6,500 square feet, but that preparation  was just actually making the inside, a gallery, and having a place for all  of them to hang their work. And then later some of our finer painters  died young. We lost them, and they were irreplaceable, like Mirac  Creepingbear. And as I went through the years   this is not what you  asked   but I just finally reduced to Merlin and Robert. Actually Robert  didn   t have a Santa Fe gallery at that time, and whatever he produced we  were able to sell in that gallery, and it was a joyful experience. But to  this day I don   t know why I felt that I could sell his, it was so unlike  what I had been known for. But  there  evolved rather rapidly a market  for his expression.  And then shortly after, Merlin came. Of course he already was more  well known, and had had another gallery, and also made shows. Robert  13  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  never made shows. Merlin, being a full-blood Indian man, could go with  CDIB into any and all of the shows that he wanted to go to, and he did.  You get exposure that way, and so he came to me with exposure.  I was hoping you would talk a little bit about Mirac Creepingbear,  who   s a Kiowa artist, whose work just continues to grow in stature. How  did you meet him, and a little bit about your relationship.  Mirac was Kiowa, Arapaho, Pawnee, but he lived his Kiowa part. Rita  Creepingbear was his mother, so he grew up among the Kiowas. He was  from Carnegie, so he was close by. He was only forty-two when he died.  He died in    90, and I gave him his first one-man show in    81, and his last  one-man show in    90. He sold other places, but I was his main gallery,  and the only gallery that gave him shows.  And you documented, didn   t you? I remember a video tape  of Mirac  talking about his work .  Yes, that last show I did. He came to the gallery one day and introduced  himself, and had work. But when the Susan Peters Gallery in Anadarko  opened   the same day that Joe McBride opened his gallery   Bob and I  went to both of those openings. McBride had been buying a lot of  Miracs, and they were in the windows, and I said to Bob,    The finest art  in Oklahoma today is that Creepingbear work that we   re looking at.      Mirac  lived in Carnegie, and he never charged very much, and so if he  could get over to Joe McBride   s over in Anadarko and sell something,  then he   d have money to go back home. So I got acquainted with Mr.  McBride, who owned the Anadarko Daily News, he and Carolyn. I asked  him if I could buy some of Mirac   s  work  from him, and that   s how I  first started.  He told Mirac that I was buying, and then he called on me. I bought  some from McBride and some from Mirac, but on the last show, I said to  him,    Mirac, I want to give you a show (in    90), and I hope you   ll paint  for it, and you   ll have income from it. But if you don   t want to, I   m  going to have it anyway, and I   ll just buy the show from McBride.    And  so I bought a show from McBride and reframed them, and Mirac came  and he painted one very large piece, which took him so long. He would  call every now and again, and he   d say,    I just can   t get this black right,  and I wish sometimes that I had gone to school, but then it wouldn   t be  my work so much. So here I am. I   m spending all my time on this very  large piece.    Then he also had time left, and he did one pastel, small, but  he saw the work on the wall, and he just couldn   t believe it was his,  because it was a whole gallery full, and we sold so well. And I told him,     I   m going to re-price your things, and I   m going to give you some of  that income from where I went up from Mr. McBride   s prices.    And we  14  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  got enough for him to buy a new little car.  Myra, his sister, lived in Los Angeles, and he went to see her, and he  was lost in East L.A. He stopped and asked for directions, and they beat  him almost to death, and they stole his car. Bob always photographed, so  he had this photographic reproduction of the whole show   he loved that  packet. I also had it taped, and he talked about it, but that wasn   t what he  liked. He liked carrying those  photos  in the car. Well, he lost his  photos, and he lost his car. He was in the hospital almost a month and I  didn   t know it, and as he got better, he rang and he said,    I   m going to  stay awhile longer. I think they might find my car.    Which I didn   t think  was very hopeful, and they didn   t.  He sent for Mirac Jr. and he went out to be with him, and then he called  and said,    He has to come back to start school, and mother   s meeting  him at the airport. He   ll have a pastel, would you buy it? She   ll bring it  over and will you buy it so he can have it to start his school things  with?    I said yes, and all of his work was just a treasure. It didn   t matter,  pastel, whatever, large canvas, just gorgeous, gorgeous pieces. So that  was the last piece I got. And then he came home. That was in August  when he was in the hospital, and he came home first of September, and  he died that October. He never really got over that. That was a great loss  of a young talent that, my goodness, no telling where  he would have  gone . It was already so finished, in my mind, you know.  What a beautiful thing, when he was in the hospital doing the pastel,  basically for his son.  Yes.  I remember that you and Bob, I know Bob went to Gallup Ceremonial  probably more than you did, but once in awhile the two of you went     Well, I went until    82, and then he continued going. But it was kind of  hard for him to go. We did all kinds of things to generate income for the  art, because we still bought.  The artists  consigned, but we still bought a  lot, and so you could consign your work to the Gallup Ceremonial and  they would hang them for you and market them. Then you   d give them a  percent for doing that. And it was kind of hard for him to have to stand  in line and have all of his art with him, but have to do all of this  registering and so forth, and leave for a little while, the art there by the  car. It was difficult, but he did it after    82 because the gallery was such a  business, I couldn   t leave it. So he went all those years by himself, and  he marketed there.  For a time, the State Fair of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City had  the   Cottonwood Post. It was a large area, and they had prepared it for Native  15  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  American painters. But you had to pay in March   quite a lot of money  for your space   and most of the time the artists just were not prepared to  do that. So we would take a whole big long wall, and we   d put up  Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery. But we would invite artists to be in there  with us, and we   d market there. Things like that seemed easy and fun.  Then, finally, it got to where he was doing the Ceremonial at Gallup,  and I was just at the gallery, and we didn   t do that anymore. But it was  fun to do a variety of things.  How did you come up with the name? I mean, it seems like a simple  name, but     A good friend and a collector said,    That is the dumbest name that I  have ever heard in my life. Why can   t you name it something like    Ni-  Wo-Di-Hi?       which was a gallery in Austin, Texas. And I said,    No,  we   re going to name it,    Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery.       And I had read  that, if you have a good feeling of self, and you open a business, you  name it after yourself, like Ray McKee   s Indian Store in Anadarko. But  I wasn   t naming it    Doris Littrell.    It was    Oklahoma Indian Art  Gallery.    Not McCabe, not Littrell, just Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery.  And then another friend of mine said,    Gee, that was so wise, because  your name tells exactly what you market.    And I got more business off  that. They would be looking in the phone book for Indian art in  Oklahoma, and there I was, Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery.  I   m thinking about how Merlin would occasionally come with a couple  of paintings, and you would look at them, and you might want one of  them, but sometimes you might call Bob in and say,    Would you like to  buy one of these paintings?    I was wondering if you two ever wanted the  same piece at the same time, and how you worked that out.  That was very interesting because if I had already picked, but I was  getting too much inventory   maybe  Merlin  had three   I would pick  one, and I would ask Bob, and he   d pick. But then sometimes I   d just let  Bob pick first. And it was just really kind of magical. Always he got  what he wanted and I got what I wanted, and hopefully, Merlin got what  he wanted. (Laughs)  The artist got what he wanted.  And sometimes, I remember, he brought just one painting, and it was  called    First Born,    and I cried. It was so beautiful. It was this mother  holding up her newborn to all of the Ancestors that had gone before,  there in the clouds, and the beautiful water where she stood and  everything.  The  landscape was beautiful, even without all of the rest.  And I thought,    Oh, it   s so beautiful.    It was the only print I ever printed  16  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  on my own, and I printed that with Merlin.  We did well with that. One of the things I loved about your gallery was  the fact that it didn   t seem like it was solely,    this is a business.    It was  a business, but it was also a place where you could sit on a really nice  piece of furniture, look at a beautiful weaving, sometimes we   d see  flowers that you might have cut and assembled. Why did you want that  look for your gallery?  Well, I just love a sense of home, number one. And I thought,    I   m  going to be up here      at first it was seven days a week, later it was six  and then finally, less. But I wanted to feel like I was at home, so I did it  for my spirit. But in so doing, it reached out to others. I didn   t say to  myself,    I want to show them how it looks.    You   d often hear   collectors  say,    Oh,  this art  needs to go in a cabin or it needs to go on  a brick wall.    It doesn   t need anything. It can hang anywhere with  anything, so it wasn   t that. It was just that I wanted to have that feeling,  that you could pick a bouquet and put it there.  Also, I never    sold.    I always felt that I    introduced    or I    shared.     That   s why I loved having shows, because it let them get together with  the painter, and see how fun that is to talk to them about what they were  thinking. Or how they felt about the subject that they   re looking at here  that they   ve painted. And that   s a different way of presenting for sale,  than someone who is a hard sell. I was never taught to sell. I never had  any training. What came natural to me was kind of a teaching. I had  books if they wanted to buy a book. They never sold a lot, but that  feeling in the air was there, I think     Of learning.  Of learning that also goes with home. So it was a gallery, but it was  more than a gallery, I thought.  Can you talk to me about how you see the artist/gallery owner  relationship, your relationship with the artists? Because every gallery  owner has a slightly different take on it.  Surely.  What you kind of see as your responsibilities or your role, I guess, as the  gallery owner, and what you see as their end of the deal?  How did I feel? As I established a gallery, I think the first thing I felt  was their Indianness   even before their paintings. That a spirit lived  with them, that was first. And I brought that in from my grandmother  and everyone that had touched my life came into that. And it went over  17  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  to them. That was the first thing. And then what we had to show was  their talent. That was the next thing, how do you present it? You present  it as if it was their home and mine. And I think they responded well to  that. That   s not to say that there aren   t other ways, but if you find what  your way is, and be true to it, that   s when it really works. But if you try  to make yourself a hard seller when you   re not, by nature, one, it  probably is not going to work for you very well.  That   s a really good point. I was thinking of the fact that you seemed  very focused, also, on helping the artist build their career.  Oh, by all means. By all means, any way I could, right up until the very  last months that I was there. If I wasn   t going to be in business any  longer, and I wasn   t going to be able to help them, to market their things  and see them grow because I was ending my gallery time, you could  always tell them where there were going to be shows that they could  enter to expose their works. So there are things that you could help with,  even if it didn   t end up in your gallery. We always did that. We had a  helping hand.  You were kind of known for the fact that you wouldn   t take just any  Indian artist who showed up. Can you tell me about some of the qualities  you looked for in an artist before you took them on?  I tried to spend enough time with them and with their work to get the  feel of how serious they were, and how, professionally, they had already  grown to be. Robert had been in a Dallas gallery   I   m speaking of  Robert Taylor   and he had made up his mind that his life work was  going to be painting. And sometimes if we didn   t have, maybe, the sales  that we had had at another time, he treated that exactly the way I treated  it. It was his business, and then it was my business. We called it just  tightening our belt, believing in the bounty, and working, working  toward when it would pick up again. Someone said to me, maybe in    84,     83, there was a recession in galleries. I didn   t even know it, I was so  busy working. And I didn   t read the books that told me. So I   m just  thinking that worked.  You were saying, in terms of artists who were sort of interested, who  were professional and interested in the  business      So I assumed from that that any of us who choose anything to do, if we  continue doing it as a life   s work, we   re going to grow in our ability.  And, in that way, if they were already extremely attractive to me, and I  felt that I would like to handle them, then I also felt they   re never going  to be working for commerce only, because I never wanted that, I didn   t  want to do it myself, and I didn   t want them to do it. So those were some  18  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  of the things that I sort of pulled together when I said yes. As I grew  older   because I was fifty when I opened my gallery, because I had  worked in Indian business a long time, but not in a gallery   I took fewer  and fewer  artists . I could not have done a good job later on with  forty   there probably weren   t even forty to be had. When we opened  was one thing, and what it   s like now, is another thing. If you took all of  the ones throughout the state, and where they go to invitationals, and all  the beginners, yes, there are a lot. But they   re not showing in galleries  yet, or something, you know. But they need to continue showing, and  that   s what the museum shows are good  for .  We   re going to move on to looking at paintings here in a minute, but I  wondered if there   s anything you   d like to add to or clarify, or  something we didn   t cover that you   d like to cover?  I think you   ve done a wonderful job of interviewing and asking  questions. I feel honored to be having access to both Merlin and  Robert   s work, and them including me in their marketing. Even though it  won   t be as expansive as the gallery, that means a lot to me. I feel very  honored because people are waiting   all over, not just this state, but lots  of places   they   re waiting. I went to an auction last Saturday with  Robert, and a gallery owner asked where he was showing and he said,     Well, Gallery 822 in Santa Fe, and Doris Littrell, broker,    and he said,     Well if you ever  are looking for a gallery , we   re waiting.    So I know  that is true.  Also people who call me to buy and sell still, that   s an honor. I don   t  want a lot of people in, just those that I felt really close to, that had  asked where they could find Merlin or Robert   s  work . This one lady  came to me, even before I told her I was the owner forty years, and she  said,    I want a Doc Tate and I want a Ha-So-De. And the money that I  want to spend is this and this.    I had bought and brought home just a few  days before, a Ha-So-De, but it isn   t for sale. But the fact that she   s  telling me,    If you locate these, this is what I   d like you to call me on.     And two other persons have come to say,    Could you take these on  consignment and market them for me?    So I can do a bit of that.  Work goes on.  Work goes on.  Doris, you   ve picked a couple of pieces that you particularly like that  are in your home, and I wonder if you could talk to us about those  paintings?  This is called Antelope Hunt, and it   s by Ha-Do-De, who happens to be a  19  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Littrell  Little Thunder  Navajo painter who passed away, I believe, a few years back. He was  considered the first contemporary Native American painter. He went  very young to the Santa Fe school, and Dorothy Dunn was instructing a  little later on, but she never tried to change his composition. In 1981, I  gave him a one-man show in the gallery, and I   ve always been  comfortable with his pieces, so I   m living happily with this one.  It   s really lovely. I   m going to hand you another one and I   m going to  adjust the camera.  This one is by Robert Taylor. It   s his most recent piece that he   s brought  me, and it   s a medicine bundle. He   s well known for his birds and  feathers, and I thought it was attractively presented with the red feathers  of the parrot. He also did a nice writing for the prospective buyer, about  what he was thinking when he created it.  Thank you.  Now I   m worried about the glass on this, so just do the best we can. This  is by Merlin Little Thunder. Merlin   s been with me maybe eighteen or  so years, and after he had been bringing things for maybe a year or so,  he brought this one. It   s called On the way to Oklahoma Indian Art  Gallery. There are all of the horses, and they   re loaded with paintings,  and I always felt a kinship to it, as if he was saying to me,    Okay now,  you wanted to work with it, so I   ve got a lot of art right here, and let   s  see what you can do.    (Laughter) My daughter Kim wants it for hers  later on.  Thank you.  -------  -------
