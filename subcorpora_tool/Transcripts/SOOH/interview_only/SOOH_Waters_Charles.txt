 Finchum  Waters  Today is May 25, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University Library, and I   m here today at the Capitol to speak with  Charlie Waters. This is for our Spotlighting Oklahoma project, and  today the focus is on Henry Bellmon.  Yes.  Thank you for having me today. Let   s start by having you tell a little bit  about yourself, where you were born, and then we   ll work our way  forward.  I was born in Washington, D.C. My father was a trial lawyer up there.  He passed away, and I moved back to Skiatook, Oklahoma, where my  grandparents were early-day merchants. I moved in and was raised  largely by my grandparents and my mother, who worked there in  Skiatook, and so that   s where I was raised. After I graduated from  Skiatook High School, I went down to the University of Oklahoma     avid OU fan. And as you   ll soon find out, Henry Bellmon came into play  and affected my career and, kind of, life   s journey for the next, I   d say  for the next fifty years.  Back in high school, did you imagine that you   d get into law and  politics?  I actually kind of did because I grew up in a small town, and my mother  had been a speech teacher. And she had this idea that everyone ought to  learn how to get up and give a speech. So we organized a debate team,  my brother and I. They didn   t even have a debate program, but we  organized a debate team and got permission to go around all over the  state and debate. We actually won the state championship. While it   s not  probably one of the grandest achievements in my life, you are talking to  the 1961 state debate champion. (Laughs)  5  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  But anyway, so I always did a lot of speaking and my father, having  been a lawyer, and actually my grandparents on my father   s side had  been in early-day politics and he been a state senator. My grandmother is  actually the first woman warden  of an all-male institution  in United  States  correctional history . She lived in Granite  and was warden 1927-  1935 . So there   s another story there, Clara Waters. I was kind of raised  on the idea of being a lawyer, and I was interested in politics. I  remember when I was a sophomore in high school, I stayed up all night  to watch my man, Richard Nixon, get defeated by John Kennedy. So I  had always had an interest in politics and maybe even being a lawyer. I  thought I   d be a doctor, but someone said,    Well, he talks and gives all  these speeches. He ought to be a lawyer.    And so, anyway, that   s kind of  what I decided to do. I was interested in politics, too, at an early age.  So your bachelor   s degree is from the University of Oklahoma?  University of Oklahoma. I have a degree in Letters. Would you know  what that is? You know what, unfortunately, not very many people do.  (Laughs) But, anyway, it   s a tri-major in history, literature, and  philosophy. I got that degree and then went on and finished law school  at the University of Tulsa, where I graduated in 1971.  When we spoke earlier you had mentioned that, in 1962, Bellmon had  come to your classroom?  Well, it   s not a great historical event, but it was 1962 and the  governorship race, and I was interested. I was a junior in high school.  They have a program called Boys State and Girls State. I don   t know if  you   ve heard of it, but the American Legion sponsors it, and they send a  lot of young men and women to these programs on state government. I  was selected to represent Skiatook at Boys State. And that was in the  summer of    62. I was between my junior and senior year.  I decided that I would go to Boys State and run for governor. So,  actually, I did, and I got nominated by the Boomer Party, I think it was.  In the course of all this, Bill Atkinson and Henry Bellmon showed up to  give talks, because they were the nominees for governor. That was the  first time in person I had seen Henry Bellmon, and I was really  impressed. He had a simple message. We needed a competitive  government. We needed a two-party state. And Bill Atkinson   s message  was that he was going to have a one-cent sales tax. That   s how we were  going to take care of state government. I think he put billboards all over  the state to do that. So, anyway, the only difference was he  Bellmon   went on to win as governor, and I lost my little race.  6  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  I came back that summer thinking,    Henry Bellmon is a great guy. He  ought to get elected governor.    So, as you probably know, the Bellmon  campaign went crisscross the state with the Bellmon Belles. He was real  big on hitting small towns and making sure the word would get out that  everybody in town would know that he had been there. I think it was in  August or September I was in Carver   s Drugstore, in Skiatook, wearing  my Boys State t-shirt. And Mr. Carver was a very outgoing man. It was  kind of the center of activity in a small town, if you know about small  towns.  Well, the next thing you know, the Bellmon Belles truck comes right  through Skiatook, and the bell was ringing, and all these ladies dressed  in Bellmon Belle dresses were going up and down the street, and in  walked Henry Bellmon into Carver   s Drug. Well, you know, if the  president of the United States had walked in, I couldn   t have been any  more impressed. Anyway, he says,    Hi, young man. You went to Boys  State?    Mr. Carver said,    What do you want?    Of course, Henry  Bellmon, who loved ice cream, said he wanted a malt. So the three of us  sat down, and I listened to them dialog about the current affairs as he  drank his malt. And I remember that encounter. So, anyway, I don   t  know if anyone   s told you how Henry Bellmon likes ice cream.  No.  You haven   t heard? Well, I can tell you. There are stories about that.  Remind me when we get to the U.S. Senate days to tell you about what I  call    the ice cream story.     Okay.  One of our biggest disagreements was over his   we almost had a fight  over him wanting to have some ice cream, I   ll tell you. (Laughs)  So you were too young to vote     Well, I was too young. I was only seventeen years old, but I had to write  themes in high school. The first one I wrote was called    The Urgency  for a Two-Party System.    It was about why they ought to elect Henry  Bellmon governor. I think I got an A on that, as a matter of fact. I should  have, anyway. It   s around here somewhere in one of my scrapbooks. I  saw it the other day. It wasn   t the best written thing, but the message  from the heart was good. So that was Henry Bellmon.  First impressions.  First impressions, if you   re interested in that.  7  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Sure, and then the next encounter     Well, I went off to college at OU and then just got involved in fraternity  activities. I was a member of a fraternity and was a student and did all  the other things college kids usually do. I would follow Henry  Bellmon   s activities at the Capitol, in the newspaper. How he wouldn   t  put on a tux and wouldn   t serve liquor, and he was having all these  fights in the legislature, but he was pretty popular. In any event, I think  the next thing happened, was it was in    65. At the end of my sophomore  year, someone suggested that I apply to be a Sooner Guide at the New  York World   s Fair. Have you heard about that?  A little bit.  A little bit? Bellmon, when he was governor, got two or three prominent  businessmen together. I think Walter Helmerich, and I can   t think  of the  other one , to raise money to set up an exhibit at the New York World   s  Fair,    64,   65 World   s Fair. Their idea was to get young men, they didn   t  think about women in those days and it was kind of discriminatory, but  in any event, was to select young college kids, train them about  Oklahoma, and have them meet visitors to the park-like setting, there. So  in 1964 a fraternity brother of mine had been selected, and he came back  and said it was a great experience and that I ought to apply.  So I thought,    Well, shoot yes  No one   s going to select me for that,     you know? But I went ahead and filled out a one-page application and  found myself being interviewed in the Blue Room at the Capitol with a  bunch of Bellmon staffers from that time, and other people. I guess I  made the final round. I wound up over in the governor   s mansion, and  they were having a social occasion. I found out later they had a  scorecard in the breakfast room, and they were going in there, writing  the names down, and scoring people as you were meeting folks. I might  tell you this, because it   s kind of a funny story. They had all these  elimination questions. The Sooner Guide may have had something to do  with it. They said,    Now, do you ever drink?    They asked me that. Now,  that   s a tough question to ask a sophomore or junior. So I said,    Well,  just an occasional beer with the fellas.    So, anyway, they all kind of  laughed. Anyway, I got selected. Not sure why, but I did. And I met  Bellmon on that occasion as well, as a Sooner Guide.  Well, they had a training session, took us up to Washington. We flew on  one of those National Guard planes, not very comfortable, but the state  could afford to do that. They crammed all the Sooner Guides, and the  press, and the governor, and everybody on that prop plane. I forgot what  that   s called. The Air National Guard ran it, and we flew up to  8  Finchum  Waters  Washington. We did a tour of the pavilion and I didn   t speak to Bellmon  too much. I was a little shy about that. I noticed one thing about him is  that we stopped there, they had a chicken delight there, and they had all  these people, New Yorkers and all these folks. Well, he was standing at  the back of the line with about fifty people, and I   m thinking,    He   s the  governor of the state of Oklahoma     And Henry Bellmon, everyone will  say this, is the most unpretentious man you   ll ever meet. And he would  never do anything just to thrust himself and to gain advantage over  another person on day-to-day conduct because of his position. Anyway,  I just had that mental picture of him. So I was a Sooner Guide, and I  went through that program and did run into him from time to time. What  did play out and was important, because of the next thing that  happened   should I go on?  Yes.  All right. Well, it   s kind of funny. So I come back, and I go to college.  Let   s see, it was my junior year in college, and what Bellmon had done  that I did not know about is, he had hired college kids to be guards at the  governor   s mansion. I didn   t know anything about that. And, anyway, I  think it was the summer of    66, actually. It was his last year in office,  and I was in Skiatook staying with my grandparents and was working.  My grandmother, who was blind but could get around, answered the  phone, and she said,    Someone is calling from Oklahoma City, and I  think the phone number they gave      I said,    Do you remember the  number?    She said,    Sure. It   s Jackson one, two, three, four, five.    I  said,    Grandmother, nobody has a number like that, nobody     She said,     Well, I remember the number. I don   t know who was calling, but I do  remember the number.    I said,    That   s one of my fraternity brothers  trying to play a joke on me. I   m not calling Oklahoma City, Jackson one,  two, three, four, five.     So, anyway, I come back the next day and she says,    Whoever it is, they  really want to talk to you. They left the same phone number.    I said,     Grandmother, that is one of my fraternity brothers. We play jokes on  each other. I   ll call and it will probably be somebody like the police  station, fire station, or governor   s office, or something like that.    So,  anyway, I let that go, and the next week I went down to Norman because  we were having rush week for the fraternity. We had pledged this big  class. I think I   m legal. I think I was twenty-one, at the time, in any  event. So we were celebrating out on the lawn of the Beta house   or  maybe it was down in the basement. Whatever it was, I   m sure it was  legal. We were having a few beers, you understand. In those days, we  had phone booths on each floor and the way they   d do that is they would  announce,    Charlie, phone on two,    or whatever, or use your nickname  or whatever. Okay. So they announced, they said,    Charlie, phone on  9  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  two.    You want the unvarnished version? You do?  Yes.  Well, you   ll have to clean it up. Is that okay? (Laughter)  Sure.  Well, it   s true.  Okay. (Laughs)  He says,    Charlie, phone on two.    So I go up there, and I answer the  phone, and this guy on the other end says,    Hello?    I said,    This is  Charlie.    This guy on the other end says,    Well, hello. This is Henry  Bellmon.    And I said,    No shit, and I   m George Wallace.    (Laughter)  Now, pardon me, that   s what I said. I should have edited it. Well, the  next minute of the conversation was him convincing me that he was  really the governor of the state of Oklahoma. He said,    No this is      I  said,    Henry Bellmon?    He says,    Yes.    And I say,    The governor of  the state?    He says,    Yes, that   s the only one I know of.    (Laughs) And I  said,    Oh, my gosh  I   m so sorry.    I mean,    I am so sorry. I didn   t  mean       he said,    No, that   s all right, that   s all right.    He was chuckling  on the other end. And he would do that. He would just pick up the phone  and call and say,    It   s Henry Bellmon,    and be the last person in the  world I expect to get a call from.  I remember, after apologizing over myself, he said,    Shirley Bellmon  and I would like to meet you. Would you come to the governor   s  mansion next Sunday afternoon?    And he says,    We have a job opening  that you   ve been recommended for.    I said,    Really?    He said,    Yes,  and we can talk about it if you are interested.    I said,    Well, certainly      (Laughs) So, I mean, well, I was twenty. So I go out, and I did not really  know how to get to the governor   s mansion. (Laughs) I mean, I was very  nervous. So, anyway, I drove to the governor   s mansion and arrived at  the right location about an hour and a half early. (Laughs) And I  remember driving around the area forever, and I thought,    Oh, my God,  I   m meeting the governor and the First Lady. Oh, my. And I   m not even  sure what this all about, something about working in the governor   s  mansion.     So when it was time, I drove in. I was greeted at the door by Shirley  Bellmon. She escorted me into the library area, and the kids came  running in, Ann and Pat. And before you know it, she just sat down, and  I thought,    Oh, my gosh, these people are just like the people I grew up  with in Skiatook. They   re good, solid, down to earth people     (Laughs)  10  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  And so we just visited up a storm about where I was or this and that, and  she was working on some project, and Ann and Gail came running in.  We visited a few seconds. She said,    Well, Henry will be home pretty  soon.    In he comes in his khaki pants and shirt. We sat down and visited,  and I instantly fell in love with the Bellmon family. It was almost  impossible not to. I guess they thought I was acceptable enough because  they hired me. So what we were, were guards at the governor   s mansion.  Now, you probably have the stories about guards and a mansion from  Lee Paden.  Just a few, but you probably have your own to share.  Well, I mean, you know what that was about. It   s actually really kind of  nuts to think about what happened. And I don   t know what the history  was. Lee probably could tell you, but I mean here I am, little five-foot-six  guy weighing at the time about a 160, not a hunter, never fired a gun  or anything. And the Bellmons evidently, now I came at the latter part of  his term, his last year, decided to send the Capitol Security Police home,  and somebody imposed on him that he ought to do something, and he  started hiring these Sooner Guides, these college kids down in Norman.  So he had one full-time security guy who was really more legit, if you  will, and then these college students.  So we were sworn in as members of the Capitol Police Force, and we  would get this uniform and everything, with the badge and the whole  nine yards. I   d wear the slacks and the shirt and put on the badge and the  little string black tie and knot, wear this big old heavy coat. And in the  closet somewhere, there was, I think, a pistol and a shotgun. I   m not sure  because I never used them, and I certainly didn   t know how to fire them,  but we were, the college kids, were the security for the governor. And in  that capacity, we became like members of the family. And there are all  kinds of things that happened there at the governor   s mansion.  I can   t help but contrast   I always think when you go down 23rd Street  today, you have the   and this is the way it should be   I mean, there was  the highway patrols there, and they got the pill box out front, and we  have all this security. So we became like members of the family. Clent  Dedek, I remember, would leave the governor   s car behind, and he was  the governor   s driver, highway patrol. You probably will visit with  Clent. Clent later became the head of Public Safety. He   s a good guy.  And they would leave, and then sometimes I would get in the governor   s  car and drive it around and always feel pretty  good     like I was the  governor   s number one, and take the kids somewhere or run some  errands or whatever.  Any funny stories from     11  Waters  Well, I mean, putting the flag upside down. At night, we had to be there.  Well, we would divide up the shifts. It was a great shift for a college kid.  We could go all over the house, but the breakfast room right   if you  know the governor   s mansion, you come into what used to be the  breakfast room. I don   t know what it is today, but anyway, we   d hang  out in there, next to the kitchen, and you could study or do whatever.  We   d answer the phones, and we   d put up the flag and take down the  flag, and then we had to shut the gate at night. What I would do is, after  the Bellmons were in or if they were going to be out, about nine or ten  o   clock as I   d recall, shut the gates.  They had this little dachshund called Tandem, and if you put Tandem  out, if anything came around, Tandem would bark. (Laughs) So I  remember once, Tandem was barking and no one was at home. I do  remember, I really thought,    Somebody is upstairs. I just know that they  are.    And so I went up in the closet, and I found this pistol, which I  didn   t know how to shoot. But I remember pulling that thing out and I  mean, I was ready if there was going to be a problem. Of course, I   d  never fired it before. I remember going up the stairs. I mean, you  remember things like this because this was a scary event. And going up  the stairs, I thought I heard a noise in the governor   s bedroom. Well, I  walked in there, and the door was open to the closet which had a full-length  mirror, and I turned around and I damn near shot that mirror  because I saw myself in the image. But, fortunately, I didn   t. If I   d  known how to operate that gun better, I might have done that, I don   t  know.  And, of course, sometimes we   d put up the flag wrong, upside down. I  think that   s a distress signal, I don   t know. There were all kinds of  things. And the girls had a lot of fun. You were almost like their big  brother. Now, in those days, I had started smoking and, of course, they  didn   t have all this anti-smoking stuff. The girls would always find my  cigarettes and hide them or throw them down the toilet.  Henry Bellmon   I   m an avid OU fan. Now, Henry Bellmon, being the  guy from OSU, I mean, you know the stories. He went off to OSU and I  think the story is, he didn   t have anything but maybe twenty dollars and  a few t-shirts and helped dig the foundations and stuff for the colleges up  there. I mean, he worked his way through school. But, anyway, in    66, I  think OU had lost in    65 for the first time to OSU in a hundred-jillion  years. But in    66, they had a rematch. And I forgot what the bet was, if  we even had one, and OSU won. I didn   t work Saturday, but on Sunday  afternoon, I was supposed to be at the governor   s mansion.  So, anyway, I remember turning in. I thought,    What are they going  12  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  to       you know. So, anyway, the governor and everybody made a point  to gather in the foyer. I normally would pull in, park in the side, and go  through the kitchen door, the side door   but the door was locked. And  so I remember they made me go around to the front door. And I went  around to the front door, and they had found a big white beach towel,  and Henry must have hung it. He hung it from the ceiling, and it had the  score of the game, and they were in the back, and I came banging in.  There they were, and they were laughing and singing    poor Sooners,     and Henry Bellmon made me wear this big OSU orange, ugly thing for  the whole day, and they were laughing and having a great time. Which  that was fine, that was fun. So, anyway, I remember that was kind of  funny at the time. I don   t know. It was a real bonding that went on with  the family. If you ever worked for Henry Bellmon, they made you feel  like you were part of the family. So I had that early experience with their  family and their kids, and it wound up lasting a lifetime.  At that point, when he finished being governor for the first time, there  was a little bit of lapse before he ran for the U.S. Senate. What were you  doing at that time?  Well, before I answer that, let me tell you one more guard story.  Okay.  And it involves his predecessor, but it involves Mrs. Bellmon, Shirley  Bellmon. As you know political history, Dewey Bartlett was nominated,  republican. Bellmon could not succeed himself, and Bartlett got  nominated running against Preston Hall and got elected. Well, Mrs.  Bartlett, Ann Bartlett is a lovely lady. It came time for that proverbial  visit between the first ladies. Ann Bartlett was going to come over to the  governor   s mansion, and Shirley Bellmon was going to give Ann  Bartlett the tour. Okay, well, what do you think was the issue of the day?  The issue of the day was,    What is Ann Bartlett going to do about the  guards?    We were all college kids, and this was a great job. I mean, it  really was. I would go to college, and I   d come there, and we got paid a  few hundred dollars a month, which was a lot of money. We would  study and be part of the family and, yet, we   d answer the phones and be  there when they had the receptions and shut the gates at night and take  down the flag. It was a great job, and we never had any real problems.  But we weren   t really trained policemen either, and it was pretty  obvious.  The Bartletts were really nice people, but they weren   t the Bellmons,  and so,    What   s going to happen to us?    I still had some more college to  finish up. I was a senior, and we had these other kids that were working  there, too.    What   s going to happen to the guards?    That was the big  13  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  issue. Well, Mrs. Bellmon   so, we all pumped her up. She was ready to  go. But anyway, she dealt with Ann Bartlett. After Ann Bartlett left, the  word went out. She wanted to meet with us. She says,    It   s not going to  be a problem. I   ve talked to Ann Bartlett. I   ve told her how critically  important you are to the operation of the governor   s mansion, and  they   re going to keep you on board.    (Laughs) Now, I know this is about  Henry Bellmon, but do you want to hear a Dewey Bartlett story?  Sure.  Do you know about Dewey Bartlett?  Just a bit.  Well, he got elected, and Dewey Bartlett was a really nice man. The  Bartletts treated us nice, but they   re more formal people. And it was a  little   it was different, but they were really nice. I stayed there about six  more months and left. It kind of makes a contrast. So I was sitting  there   they had a little guard station, a table by the front desk, and that  was where the guards were really supposed to be, but no one had ever  sat there. (Laughs) But now, we have the new governor coming in so we  all decided we   re going to obviously be on good behavior. So we all sat  at our little guard   s station where we belonged, but never had sat at      you understand   except if they had a reception.  Dewey Bartlett had a sense of humor. He had a dry sense of humor, but  anyway   well, I kind of do, too. And so sometimes I   d make  inappropriate jokes and say things that I shouldn   t. Do you believe that?  (Laughs) Okay. So Dewey Bartlett   s been governor now for two weeks,  and when I   d been there, I   d been very appropriate. I   d been sitting there  at the guard   s stand. And when he comes in,    Governor, how are you  doing today?    and so forth. So, one day, he stops me, and he says,     Charlie.    He said,    If we had a problem, what would you do?     (Laughs) And I said,    I think I   d call the police.    (Laughs) He said,     Police?    I said,    But I don   t know their phone number.    (Laughs) Well,  he didn   t laugh. I thought it was kind of funny. Don   t you think it   s  funny? Well, he didn   t, I guess. The next day I came back to work and  there was a little hand-written note from Dewey Bartlett, the governor.  He says,    Charlie, I   ve arranged for you to go to the firing range today  with      I think Clent Dedek. (Laughs) I   m not sure. One of his drivers,  and I   m not sure if it was Clent.  So they picked me up, and we went out to the police firing range, and  they had this .38. It was the first and only time I   ve fired a .38. I fired a  .38 all day long. I was pretty good at it. You had to learn to hold it like  this, and do that, and so I learned to fire the gun. (Gestures) So the next  14  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  day Dewey Bartlett shows up,    Well, how   d you like the firing range?    I  said,    It   s fine.    I said,    Now, you can say I   m just your paid killer.     (Laughs) He thought that was funny, and he would affectionately call  me    paid killer,    and I think one of those photos I have over there  is  signed that way . I stayed on with the Bartletts for about six months, and  then I left there. That ended my career as a police officer, which was  very distinguished. (Laughs) Don   t you think?  But it didn   t end your career with the Bellmons.  No, it did not end my career with the Bellmons.  Just the public aspect.  All right, where do we go from here? Am I telling you more than you  want to know?  No, it   s great.  It is?  It is.  Okay, that kind of stuff you want. Okay, so, I   m tracing this. Actually, I  had enrolled in law school at OU and was down there, and I had stayed  on with the Bartletts some at their request for a while. I was in law  school and Henry Bellmon, of course, in    67 had become Nixon   s  campaign manager and was planning to run for the Senate, and they  needed someone from this neck of the woods to be head of the Nixon  campaign. So, in    67, that   s what he did. I always thought,    If he runs  for the Senate, I really want to do whatever I can to get him elected, but  I   m only twenty-two or three years old and I really don   t know what I  could do.    But I ran into Dorothy Stanislaus one day. And Dorothy was  like the Republican National Committee woman, very active in politics.  I hadn   t seen her in many years, but I saw her somewhere, and I asked, I  said,    Well, how   s Henry Bellmon doing?    If Henry Bellmon   s going to  run for the Senate, I know he is, and I want to do what I can to help  him.    She says,    He would love to hear from you.    I said,    Really?    She  said,    Yes, I think he would. I think he   d love to hear from you. Why  don   t you call him up and just go see him and tell him that?    And I  thought,    Well, I don   t know. Okay.     He had an office. He had resigned from the Nixon thing. It was    67, and  he had an office in where, now, Able   s Law Firm is. It was called the  White House, up here near the Cowboy Hall of Fame. Up there on 63rd  is an office building. He had an office and Chris Horton was his  15  secretary. So I called and just went in to see him. He   s a busy guy. And,     How are you doing?    And,    How   s college,    and this and that. And I  said,    Well, I saw Dorothy. She said I ought to come by to see you. I  really think you   d do a great job as U.S. senator, and I   d really like to do  something for you.    And he said,    Well, what do you think you can do?     (Laughs) And I said,    I don   t know.    He said,    I   ll tell you what I want  you to do.    And I wasn   t really thinking about asking for a job or  anything. I just wanted him to know that I wanted him to get elected.  He said,    Well, sit down. Well, actually, I want you to do something,  Charlie.    He said,    I want you to sit down and think about what you  could do to help me get elected and write me a letter and come see me.        Really?       Yes.    So I got back. I was in college. I got back, and I got a  letter from him, a follow-up about how nice it was seeing me again and  this and that. I thought,    Well, what can I do?    Oh, my gosh  That   s a  pretty good question, isn   t it? I said,    He   s   my goodness,    you know. I  had a good friend at the time named Don Cogman, and Don   this is a  long story   but he was a fraternity brother of mine, and he was working  for Clarence Warner, who at the time was the chairman of the  Republican Party. He was just a staffer in there, my age, young. We  were all young once.  He says,    Charlie      he gave me the idea. He says,    There   s this fellow  who is a republican, and got elected, I think, as the first republican  senator from Tennessee and his name is Howard Baker. And you know  what he did?    I said,    What?       He organized young people all over the  state and colleges and even in high schools, kids that couldn   t vote. And  they organized something, and it was a big success.    I said,    Really?  What   s his name again?    He said,    Howard Baker. He just got elected in     66.    And so I said,    Fine.    He said,    You might call him up and see if  there   s some idea that might work.     So I picked up the phone and found out where Howard Baker   s office  was and asked to talk to the campaign manager or whoever ran his  campaign. And I said who I was, and I said,    Henry Bellmon is running,  and I   m just looking for ideas how young people that couldn   t vote, how  they could help him get elected.    He said,    Well, we set up this Young  Tennesseans for Baker campaign throughout the state. We had hundreds  of kids organized and doing rallies and everything, and it was a big  success.    I said,    Could you send me anything on that?    And he did. He  says,    Sure.    So they sent me a whole stack of stuff about their  campaign literature and all that. And it worked. And I called them back  and talked to them, and they answered all my questions, and I says,     That would work for Henry Bellmon. And it   s perfect in this state  because this state   s a big democratic state, and he   s a republican.    The  registration for republicans, I don   t know what the figures were in    68,  16  but they were very, very low. You had to register democrat to even vote.  So imagine that. And here he was a republican in a democratic state, and  he   s got to get democrats to vote, or he   s not going to win. So we   ll set  up Young Oklahomans for Bellmon groups, and that would be good.  I plagiarized their idea, although I did tell the governor it had been  proven, and it had worked. (Laughs) And I sat down, and I wrote up  everything I had learned. I wrote a paper on it, and I attached samples of  stuff that they had used in Tennessee, and I sent it to him. Well, it wasn   t  two days later, I get a call from him, and he says he wants to see me.  (Laughs) He said,    When can you go to work?    He said,    You want to  do this?    I said,    Yes     He said,    Well, go for it.    He says,    You are  now the director of the Young Oklahomans for Bellmon.    So, anyway, I  thought that was pretty neat. That was my first major involvement. I was  on his staff and the state headquarters was down here in Lincoln, and I  was on his staff. I got to go to all the staff meetings and learn how the  big boys do it, the campaign managers and the finance people.  I had a map with all these clubs, and I got in the car, and I had a lot of  energy. I wish I had that energy today. I drove all over the state. He just  let me go. He gave me some nominal salary, but I didn   t care. It was  plenty, and set up a small budget. I set up in college campuses and high  schools, too, all across the state, a Young Oklahomans for Bellmon  group. I   ve got all kinds of literature on it. We put out our brochures and  our literatures, and they generated publicity for him throughout the state.  In those days, you ran a campaign a lot different than today. The  grassroots effort was so important. So we set up, and I   d go everywhere.  I learned a lot about campaigning, because he just kind of let me go.  I remember one time, he turned back. He   d gotten some phone calls. I   d  been down in Little Dixie. (Laughs) Finding a republican in Little Dixie  was pretty hard, wasn   t it? So I went down there, and I had met with  some folks. I would get the names of these young people that were like  the valedictorians and all that stuff, and then I   d arrange to set up  meetings, and the parents would come, and I   d set up these groups. And  they   d get all excited and then get started and do something. So I did  that. I remember getting back, and Bellmon says,    Charlie, I got a phone  call. You were down in      wherever it was, in Little Dixie, I forgot,  Hobart, or something. And he says,    I got a call from the republican  chairman. He said he wanted to know what you were doing.    He said,     Did you call him?    I said,    No     He said,    Well, when you go into a  county, you   ve got to at least call the republican chairman.    I said,     Well      and he said,    You   ve got a bunch of democrats organized  down there for me.    And I said,    That   s good.    He said,    How did you  do that?    I said,    Well, I just tell them the truth.    He said,    What   s  that?    I said,    I tell them this is a Bellmon group to get elected. It has  17  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  nothing to do with whether you   re republican or democrat. As you know  better, I   m a democrat.    (Laughs) So that was the first time that he found  out that I was a registered democrat.  I had turned twenty-one and like most Oklahomans, if you were going to  vote in the primaries in those days, you had to register as a democrat. He  was kind of surprised to find out that I was really a registered democrat,  but it did serve me well. I changed my party registration at some point  after that. (Laughs) So, anyway, I learned that you didn   t work around     but we set up these bipartisan groups, and we had hundreds of these  clubs really, and they got all kinds of press. I like to think it helped in his  campaign. It was a lot of fun.  It   s good.  Is it okay?  Yes.  Oh, that campaign was very exciting, a lot of things about it. As far as  young people did, I remember when he wanted to file for office, and I  think you could waive the filing fee if you had so many petitions,  signatures, and voters, and he did that. I remember when he filed. We  organized about three or four hundred young people with signs, and all,  on the Capitol. And what we were trying to do   now, I used to kid.  What we were trying to do with the young people, and we had our own  campaign stuff. And Mike Monroney, who was sixty-six   now, I know  that   s ancient. I   m sixty-six now, but when I was twenty-one, I thought     Sixty-six, you   re just one step away from the grave.    (Laughs)  Mike Monroney, somewhere in one of his speeches   Monroney had  been around for thirty years as congressman and all that, and really had a  distinguished career, not bad at all. But anyway, Monroney had said,     For those of us today, it   s difficult for those of us at my age to  understand and think young people today.    Well, I lifted that because he  did say it, it was true. I had something I said,    Mike Monroney, who will  be seventy-two before his next term expires       So, we ran Henry  Bellmon as the youth candidate. He was in his forties, and Mike  Monroney is this old geezer. (Laughs) I saw him  Henry Bellmon   shortly before he passed away, and I think I was sixty-four or five. I  said,    Now, Henry Bellmon, you know you   re getting old when your  youth director is sixty-five.    (Laughs) So, anyway, what do you want to  do about the    68 campaign?  Election night, maybe?  18  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Well, I could talk about election night. I keep thinking some other things  before then.  Well, go ahead then.  Well, now, the statute of limitations has run out. I don   t know if I should  tell this or not, but it comes out of the dirty tricks category. There was  this guy   I think many years passed before I told the story, but it   s kind  of funny. Let   s see. We had all these college kids out, and they were  assigned to put up signs, and this and that, the night before the election.  Well, I get this call, like at ten until midnight from this one guy who     it   s a good thing I can   t remember his name. I   m not going to say it, it  would be terrible. But in any event, he called and he says,    Charlie, this  is so and so.    He says,    You can   t believe what I   ve got.    I says,     What?    He says,    I have become the distributor for all the Mike  Monroney signs in Oklahoma County, for south Oklahoma County.    I  said,    What?     He said,    I   ve got all the signs in my truck.    Well, I  noticed that on election morning, there were not as many Mike  Monroney signs up as there were Henry Bellmon   s, because I have a  feeling that those signs might have wound up in the Canadian River  somewhere, I don   t know. I   d had nothing to do with that, but that  happened. (Laughter) That   s not right, I know that, but it was kind of  funny when you look back on it now.  Election night. On the campaign, one thing about Bellmon, I remember  going to some election things, and I was just a young kid on the block,  but I got to sit through some meetings. On one side, you had the finance  people. And I think his finance director was   I think it was Walt  Helmerich, big businessman, raised a lot of money. And he had Drew  Mason, who was running the campaign. He had Don Ferrell, who   s head  of organization. You visited with Don. He probably told you about that  campaign. And you had the Bellmon Belles heads, and there was  Bellmon. And I remember sitting there listening to debates, because you  had one guy raising the money and the other guy spending the money.  There   s just a natural pull, or natural tension, between that because if  you were spending it quicker than you were raising it, or whatever. But  then you got the candidate. And what does the candidate think?  The race wasn   t a sure-fire cinch. After all, Monroney had been around  for thirty years. Mr. Aviation. He   d brought in the FAA, I think, in  Tinker Field, done a lot of things. And Bellmon   s running on the Nixon  record, but what I remember most is there was a big push on him to run  a lot of ads at one point, just nagging him, campaign stuff. And I  remember him saying,    I   m not going to do that, or      and there may  have been some run, but I just remember him saying,    I   m not going to  do that. I   m not going to run a negative campaign.    I mean, that was his  19  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  nature.    I want to be elected on my deal.    Well, by the very nature of a  campaign, it   s run negative because you   ve got to show some contrast  with your opponents, of course. But he was so adamant about that, and  people were arguing about him doing that and wanting him to do that.  Of course, their stories are legendary. I   m sure Bob Haught   s got them  about Henry Bellmon   s speaking style, and how they had to adjust the  cameras in order to get   did Bob tell you that story?  No.  Oh, I wasn   t there, but maybe it was Doc Jordan, head of advertisement.  I think that   s it. Doc passed away. He ran his campaign in terms of  advertising. And Henry Bellmon was not a great public speaker, but in  some ways, he became a great communicator because of his style. But  they had to position the cameras because he was always looking down.  They had to position the cameras so they could get him on the camera.  It   s unlike Shirley Bellmon. He would want to put his hands in his  pockets so when he ran for governor the first time   you see a lot of  poses of him with his hands behind his back, but the reason for that is  Shirley Bellmon, because he was always sticking his in his pockets, she  sewed up his pockets so he couldn   t put his hands in his pockets.  (Laughter) Did you know that? There are a lot of poses of him holding  his hands behind his back, and I always thought that Shirley Bellmon  had trained him well, at least. I don   t think he put his hands in his  pockets anymore.  I used to do a Henry Bellmon imitation, and he would always try to get  me at public gatherings to do it. I remember once he embarrassed me at  a fundraiser when Gerald Ford was in town, in    74. I was at one of those  fundraiser tables, and he said,    Oh, and Charlie Waters is in the back  row. He does this great imitation of me they say, and I   ve never had him  do it.    And it was Gerry Ford there to give a presentation, and I was on  the back row. Well, it embarrassed me to death.    What am I going to do?  He   s called me up in front of all these fundraisers to do a Henry Bellmon  imitation.    To all those people, I said,    Well, it really isn   t hard. You  just kind of stand there and do nothing.    (Laughs) They all laughed. He  deserved it, don   t you think? (Laughter) Henry Bellmon   s speaking style  has been something we   ve kidded about for a long time.  Would he write his own speeches, or     Well, no   well, I   when we talk about the Senate days and speech  writing, you ask me that question     Okay.  20  Waters  Finchum  Waters     because I   ll tell you. We had to trick him a little bit, because he   d do  things that would make it doubly hard. Election night was really very  exciting, and I remember the staff gathered down at the Howard  Johnson   s motel, here on Lincoln Boulevard. It   s closed up. We had  some rooms and I mean, it was very, very exciting. I used to be a trial  lawyer in the    70s   or in the    80s   it was a long time ago, and I  remember waiting for a jury to come in. About the only thing I can think  equates to that was waiting for a jury to come in, in some case you   d  tried. But it was very exciting. We went downtown and I don   t know if  this was a Sheraton or which hotel, with the big ballroom. There are  some photos of all that. We really kind of, as I recall, we led Monroney  pretty much from the get-go. I think we wound up winning by forty, fifty  thousand votes or something. I don   t remember the number.  It really came in pretty good, and we knew early on that Bellmon was  going to win and everybody was happy, and he gave his talk, but we  didn   t know about Nixon. If you   ll recall the    68 Nixon race, Hubert  Humphrey got nominated, of course, and Johnson. The Chicago  convention, they had all the riots, Mayor Daley, because they had the  anti-war protestors, and Hubert Humphrey   it was a very   and he  finally had his acceptance speech in the wee hours in the night. He went  into that race a very wounded candidate for office and, I think, very,  very far behind. But due to his tenacity and campaigning, the polls had  narrow, narrowed up until, really, it became somewhat of a cliffhanger. I  forgot what the spread was, but Nixon finally won the race. It became  very, very close, but it wasn   t until later in the evening that we knew that  Nixon had won. Bellmon was tied so closely to Richard Nixon, and the  campaign was, in terms of the issues we were running on and this and  that and, of course, the national presidency.  I remember there wasn   t really a feeling of exuberance and victory until  after the presidential returns had come in and Nixon had beaten  Humphrey. That   s a really great campaign to study, Hubert Humphrey  and Nixon. Later on, Hubert Humphrey   and we had run against a lot of  the Johnson administration and Hubert Humphrey   and Hubert  Humphrey became a very close personal friend to Henry Bellmon. I  could tell you about that. You might remind me to ask you about that,  okay?  Okay.  So Bellmon gets elected, and he goes to Washington. And I had dropped  out of law school to work for Bellmon that year and went and did a  service obligation, came back. But in any event, he wanted me to come  to Washington and go to law school and work in his staff. Well, I knew  myself well enough to know I had not done very well in law school the  21  Finchum  Waters  first year. I   d gotten mononucleosis, and I had to drop some courses, and  I had struggled. I had made some D   s and C   s. Well, that   s not my style,  and I was very unhappy about that. He thought if I   d come up there and  go to one of the many fine law schools up there and work on his staff,  it   d be a good thing to do.  I didn   t. And he wrote some letters to all the schools to make sure   to  see if he could get me accepted. I think one of them finally did accept  me, but I decided that I knew me too well, and I   d always wanted to be a  lawyer, and I wasn   t going to be an average law student. I had to be a  good law student, and I knew my nature. If I went up there and worked  for him, law school would go by the boards, and I would be a bad law  student. And I wanted to be a lawyer, so I told him. I turned down his  offer. And because I had been out of school for a year, and I was getting  old   I was all of twenty-three, and life was going by. You know how a  year   s a lot when you   re twenty-three, isn   t it?  It is.  But at my age, it   s not, but at twenty-three it is. So I decided to go to  Tulsa, because they had a trimester program, and you could get through  quicker. I had enrolled in Tulsa, and my hometown of Skiatook is just  north of Tulsa. I said,    I   ll stay there. Cut down the cost. Go to Tulsa.     So I told him no, and that   s what I was going to do, and I got enrolled in  Tulsa University. But I had a couple of months before school started,  and so I got a call from Bellmon. He   s up in the Senate. And he says,     Charlie.    I said,    Yes.    He says,    I got an idea, and I need your help.  You   re not in school yet.    I says,    No, no.    He says,    I   ll put you on the  payroll if you   ll take care of this problem.    I said,    Fine.    (Laughs) He  says,    They   ve given me this federal office space in the Federal  Building.    He said,    I don   t want to have an office in the Federal  Building. I want to have an office on the street level in Tulsa where  people can know I   m there and can come in and see you, and we can  help solve their problems that way.    He says,    I want to set up a Tulsa  office on the street level. Would you see if you could find a location?    I  said,    Well, sure.    He says,    Drew Mason,    who was running his  office   he says,    Drew knows how much money it is, but it   s not very  much.     He might   ve told me what it was, and it wasn   t a lot of money, but I  didn   t know about office space. And also, if you got a U.S. senator in  your building, it doesn   t hurt your business, probably. That   s kind of  what my selling point was. We didn   t have much money, but we have a  guy that   s got a good title. (Laughs) So, anyway, I spent several weeks,  and we really couldn   t afford to live in a high-rent district, but we could  live kind of on the fringes of downtown Tulsa. I had located several  22  places that I thought we could afford, and we finally located in a  building called the Wright Building. I forgot what street that is, but I   m  sure it   s a nice part of Tulsa now, but it wasn   t a blue chip area. But in  any event, it was okay. And the man was very happy to have Bellmon in  there. He chose that place, and I helped set it up and get the equipment  and all that before I went to law school.  But the one I want to tell you, tells you a lot about Henry Bellmon, is  that I had found these three or four places. I called him up and I said,    I  found three or four places I want you to see.    He said,    All right. I   ll fly  to Tulsa, and you can pick me up.    I had that    65 Mustang, and I always  remember Henry Bellmon   with the stick shift. He was a big man, and I  always drove him around in my    65 Mustang. It was a cool car. But in  any event, I picked him up at the airport, and we   re going around  looking at these offices. Then he says,    I want you to set aside the day.  And then can you take me to the farm when we get through? Whenever  it is. You can stay up there if you want to. Come back. What do you  want to do? We can visit all the way up to the farm so just count on that.  If it   s late and you want to spend the night, fine, whatever, but I need  some transportation to the farm.    I said,    Fine.     I pick him up and we start looking at the offices. Two things happened  that day that I   ll always remember that epitomized the kind of person  Henry Bellmon was. And I   ve told these stories, because it   s just Henry  Bellmon. We were going around to these offices and we   re in one  location, and I left him there on the street. I said,    I have to go up      I  had gotten the keys or something, and I had to go back up with the  owner. He was going to give me some stuff, and Bellmon just says,    I   ll  stay here.    So I go up with the owner upstairs to wherever the office  was. I was gone about ten minutes. Well, I come back down and there  was no Henry Bellmon. He   s gone. There   s no Henry Bellmon. Well,     Where is he? What is he doing? We   ve got other people   where did he  go?     Well, I look down the street. I started walking down the street, and there  on the street, on the curb, was Henry Bellmon. He was sitting on the  curb with a homeless, obviously probably alcoholic, destitute guy. And  he was sitting there just carrying on a conversation. It was kind of  animated. And I kept a respectful distance away. But little discussion  because it was time to move on, but not knowing, and I was standing  back until I got his attention. He stood up, shook hands with the man. I  rushed up to him, and he says,    Come with me.    Well, Henry Bellmon  was this big strapping of a guy, and I   m a little old five-six guy. When  he starts going out, I almost have to run to keep up with him.  He spots, down on the corner, this police officer. And that   s where he  23  Finchum  Waters  starts heading, and I   m just strolling along there. He walks up to this  police officer, taps him on the shoulder. The guy turns around. He says,     Hello, I   m Henry Bellmon.    Says,    Oh, yes. Yes, the senator.    Henry  said to him, he says,    There   s a gentleman down here, right there down  the block, and I think he   s ready to go get treatment for alcoholism.    He  said,    When I was governor, I set up a program to Dr. Donahue  down      I think he said,    down in Ok   whatever it was.    And he said,     Now, I know what you guys do. Will you call Dr. Donahue and arrange  for him to go down there?    And then he took out his wallet. Pulled out  all his money, a lot of bills, thrust it in the police officer   s hand, and  said,    This should cover the expense.    I don   t know what happened, and  then we went on from there. I thought that was pretty cool. Yes. So I  don   t know what happened to that man, but I can assure you of one  thing. That police officer probably did exactly what he was asked to do.  Okay, well, I   ve got another Bellmon story, the same type. That   s a good  story about him, isn   t it?  Yes.  I think Bellmon decided that we needed that day. I was going to take  him back to the farm. Henry Bellmon had a lot of energy. I was getting  really tired, but we drove up through Cleveland and back roads and  stopped and ate, and it was getting late. It was dark. I really don   t know  the state highways, but there   s a state highway between Perry and up   it  goes up to, I think, Ponca City and on over from the interstate. And it   s a  two-lane highway, and then you can go into his farm the back way.  Well, it was late at night, and I am very tired. And I   m thinking,    I don   t  want to spend the night at the farm. I want to get back and drive to  Skiatook.    So I was looking at my watch. It was well past ten, and I   m  tired. I   m going to get rid of him, dropping him off, the senator, and go  back to Skiatook, and I   ll be happier. (Laughs) It just shows this is what  country people do. It   s nothing un-normal, except the time of day. It was  late. I was zipping up Highway 81, tired, late at night, dark, and next  thing I know, I thought maybe he was snoozing   had napped. Henry  Bellmon could nap anywhere. Remind me to talk about Henry  Bellmon   s napping stuff in the Senate. (Laughs)  But anyway, Henry Bellmon says suddenly,    Charlie, turn around     I  thought,    Oh, what is he talking about? Turn around? I   m zipping down  the state highway. It   s late at night. It   s a two-lane highway.    He says,     Turn around     I said,    You want to what?       Turn around        Okay.    So  I have to go on the shoulder of the road to turn around. I said,    What do  you see?    He said,    I saw a car back there.    I said,    You saw a car back  there?       Yes.    So, anyway, I go back like a mile and sure enough, there  on the side of the road   it was dark   was this car. It was stopped, and it  24  Finchum  Waters  had two teenagers in it. Okay? And he gets out of the car.    Well, what   s  wrong?    he said.    Well, mister, we can   t get our car started. We can   t  get it to turn over.     He gets in there, and he tried to start it. He couldn   t  do it. He looks under the hood. I wouldn   t know a spark plug from a   I  mean, I don   t know anything about cars. But he was a farmer. I mean, he  knows something, I guess.  Anyway, he   s looking under the hood, and he   s doing stuff, and he says,     I   ll tell you what.    He says,    I   ll be back.    I thought,    I   ll be back?  Okay.    So we get in the car. I said,    Where we going?    He said,    We   re  going to the farm.    So we head way on up. I don   t know how many  more miles, four or five, cutting back here and there. We go down back  roads. We get to the farm. Well, there   s the farmhouse and then there   s  the original farmhouse that has the old barn. I remember we have to go  through there. I   m in my    65 Mustang. The roads aren   t the greatest. We  get into a barn, and he says,    Put the lights up there on the barn.    He  opens the barn. He goes in there. He   s got his white shirt and stuff on.  He   s coming, rattling around with stuff. He finds what he wants, some  tools. And we get back in the car, and I thought,    I   m not asking any  questions. I just want to get this day over with.    (Laughs) And here we  are, it   s near midnight, and he   s getting car tools. (Laughs)  We get back on the road. We drive all the way back. He gets under the  hood, and he starts doing stuff. Before you know it, the car starts up and  starts going. And the kids get in the car. They say,    Mom and Dad are  probably going to be really upset with us.    There are no cell phones in     69. And they zip off to Ponca City, and we finally get back to the farm.  It must   ve been one or two o   clock in the morning. They didn   t know  that a United States senator had taken time out of his busy day, at the  end of a hard day, to repair their automobile so they could get home that  night. That   s pretty nice, isn   t it?  It is nice.  Yes. Well, I made a mistake. He wanted me to stay at the farm, but I  didn   t want to stay at the farm, so I got home at three or four in the  morning. But that was okay, except I remember that day well. And  probably at my age, then, I wasn   t a compassionate sort of guy. He,  probably, didn   t think anything of that because when you live out in the  country and people have problems, you stop and take care of them.  That   s just what you do, and that   s the way he was. So the fact he was a  U.S. senator, or something, didn   t change his character. That   s just what  you did. So it wasn   t so unusual that the kids didn   t know that he was  Henry Bellmon or a U.S. senator or something. I wish he   d at least told  them. That   d have been kind of a nice thing for them to let their parents  know, that a U.S. senator went out there and spent an hour trying to fix  25  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  their car in the middle of the night. But that   s Henry Bellmon.  Did you ever spend the night at the farm?  Oh, a couple of times. He   d say,    Go spend the night at the farm. I   ll call  George and let him know someone   s coming,    because they   d kind of  look after people. If there   s a strange car there at the Bellmon house late  at night, then they would know to probably check it out. The other thing  about that farm, is   and it was this way forever   they   ve changed the  phone number, but his phone number used to be Randolph-53411 at the  farm. Henry Bellmon, when he was in the Senate or whatever, he   d fly  back to the farm to work on the farm, do the wheat pastures, and all that.  Shirley would be there from time to time or if she wasn   t, she   d stay in  Washington and he   d be there. And if the phone rang, what do you do  when the phone rings? Do you have an answering machine if you   re a  U.S. senator? No  Heck, no  No, you don   t have an answering machine.  You just pick it up and say,    Hello, this is Henry.    (Laughs)  So anybody could call   and it   s listed. Randolph-53411, that was the  number. Henry Bellmon would answer or Shirley if somebody would  call, prominent people, anybody, senators, governors, whoever. Shirley  would say,    Well, Henry   s out on the pasture,    or,    He   s heading to  town. I   ll have him call.    And that   s the way it was. That was the  protocol at the Bellmon house for as long as I can remember, listed  phone number and no answering machine. I imagine that   s always just  the way it was. It was kind of unusual, isn   t it?  So I went into law school and let   s see   is there anything else about  that? We set up the Tulsa office, and they had an open house, and then I  said,    I   m going back to law school, and I   m going to be good student.  I   m going to focus on that. That   s what I   m going to do.    That was in  September of 1970. That   s what I did. I spent two years in Tulsa law  school.  Did you communicate with him much during those few years?  Not too much, no, I didn   t.  Kept up with what he was doing in D.C.?  I did. I mean, I read in the papers and followed what he did. But I really  was focused on  school . I wanted to be a good  lawyer . My father had  been a lawyer, and I just wanted to be a good lawyer. I thought what I  really wanted to do was either be a trial lawyer   and I was a good  student, which is hard to believe. I was a good student and several of the  professors took an interest in me, and they wanted me to be a law  26  professor. I was flattered by that. I was accepted to some graduate  programs, and was trying to decide which one to take. If you were going  to be a professor, you don   t learn how to teach contracts or these  courses. You need a title so you   ve got to go off somewhere. I think it  was Pennsylvania, University of Pennsylvania and University of Illinois  had offered me a graduate school fellowship to get a master   s in law.  If you had a master   s in law, then you had something to put on a   you  know how these schools are. They like to have your name there. It  doesn   t matter. Then you come back and teach contracts or torts, which  you hadn   t taken since you were a freshman in law school, but that   s the  way it worked. One of the professors even encouraged me to have me  teach a class or two. I thought about that and the Justice Department. I   m  only saying this not to brag or anything, but to lay a predicate, okay,  because I don   t want to sound arrogant. So, anyway, it   s just kind of the  decision young people make and how it affects their life. Life is like  that. You make a decision, and you don   t go back. In any event, I don   t  regret it. It   s just the way it was.  So I was really trying to decide whether to go to graduate school, or the  Justice Department had offered me a job in Washington in the anti-trust  division. I thought I was going to do the graduate school work. Well,  Bellmon found out that I had been a good law student, which probably  shocked him because, after all, I started out guarding him and had done  the campaign, the Young Oklahomans for Bellmon. He found out I was  actually a good law student.    So maybe he had some brains,    I don   t  know what he thought. (Laughs) And so he calls me up. He says,     Charlie.    He says,    I   m going to be in Tulsa. Do you want to have  lunch?    I said,    Well, sure. That   d be great.    I was graduating and trying  to decide what to do, and really had given up on the idea of going to  Washington or working for him in Washington. I hadn   t heard from him.  I really enjoyed the study of law, law school at the time, and I just  thought this would be a good thing to do. I thought he was all staffed up  there anyway, and I really didn   t think about it. I knew I had made the  right decision to go to law school full time, as opposed to working up  there, because I knew my nature. I   d never get law school done.  So, anyway, the only way it   s important, Bellmon calls me up and he  says,    Let   s have lunch,    and so I pick him up at the airport and we go  have lunch. And he wanted to know what I was up to. He finally says,     Charlie.    He said,    You   re out of law school, right? Why don   t you  come to work for me as a legislative assistant in Washington?    I said,     Well, I don   t know. I need to think about it.    I said,    I was thinking  about doing this law school stuff and this and that.    And then he  explained to me that what he thought. He said,    You learned the ropes,  and I think there will a time when you could be in charge of this thing.    I  27  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  think his vision then was to bring in some young, bright guys   not that  I   m one of them. He says,    We   re in a different mode. I   m in a  legislative mode, not a campaign mode, which requires a different  approach and different kinds of people.    He said,    I think I   m going to  set up offices all over the state, and do some transferring of staff and  things like that. So, does that make sense?     So, of course, that   s pretty heady stuff for a fellow just out of law  school. That was, what, 1970,    71. I was twenty-six so that was pretty  heady stuff. Of course, at twenty-six, I thought I was pretty seasoned.  Anyway, I thought,    Well, I can always go to graduate school, but going  up there for a couple of years would be good experience, so why not?     And I was a single guy, too, and so I had nothing to tie me down, which  was really good. That   s how you got to go to Washington   as a single  person with no family, so you can see and enjoy the sights because it   s  so expensive. People have to live way out in the boonies. But I   m a  single fellow, so it was the best time in life to go.  I was twenty-six, seven years old, twenty-six. Actually, I had passed the  bar exam, and I think I got up there around March or so of    72. I found a  place that was on the hill, just within walking distance, little old  efficiency apartment, not as big as this office. One of those places where  you have to go through the closet to get to the restroom, you know those  places? (Laughter) And the kitchen, the Pullman kitchen or whatever it   s  called, was behind the sliding door, little, miniature, and unfurnished. I  think I bought a beanbag chair and a TV and slept on the floor. (Laughs)  But I was this young legislative assistant, full of energy and going to  work for the United States senator. I stayed in that  place  and worked  for him in Washington for about four or five years.  Did you buy any more furniture?  I did buy some more furniture. It was really beautiful. You should have  seen that. My mother came up. She couldn   t believe it. I had one of these  burnt orange carpets, you know, it really looked good. And a black  beanbag chair. But the most important thing I bought first was I got a  television with a remote control, the one button where the thing turns. It  was a colored television. It was a General Electric. So I had that and a  beanbag chair. That   s all you need   and a pole lamp. You know what I  mean? So life was good. I finally bought a bed, I think, after I was there  a month or two. I think I slept on some cot or something. I don   t know.  That   s what you do when you   re young, isn   t it?  It is.  You remember those days? Bellmon paid me a good salary, although I  28  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  wasn   t interested in money so much as just going to work there. It  wasn   t an eight-to-five job. It was like a seven-day-a-week thing. It was  whatever you   because that was the way I was. I was committed to that  and that   s what we did. The Senate.  Do you remember your first day coming into town?  That   s a good question. Traffic is awful, and I would drive. Do you  remember driving up in Washington? Have you done that?  I have not driven, but I   ve been many times.  Of course, I remember. I had had a wreck, and my    65 Mustang went ka-put,  this doesn   t have anything to do with Henry Bellmon, and I wanted  to buy this 240-Z. Remember when those came out?  Yes.  That was the coolest looking car. I remember I was sitting in law school,  in    71, and those things were coming out, and I had a brochure. And I   d  sit there and admire those 240-Z   s. I mean, it   remember those?  I do.  When it first came out,    71. I thought,    I   d give anything if I had one of  those.    I graduate from law, Bellmon offers me this job, so now I have a  salary. And so I went out to price those things. You know how much  they wanted for them? It was  4100 dollars,  4100 dollars  That was too  rich for my blood,  4100 dollars  So I went to the Chevrolet dealership  there in Skiatook, where I grew up, and I think I bought a 1972  Chevrolet Monte Carlo. I only had to pay  3200 dollars, I think.  (Laughter) I drove my Monte Carlo up there, and it was loaded up with  everything I own. I mean, everything I took was either in the back seat  or the trunk of this Monte Carlo.  I remember driving around Washington. I kept the Oklahoma tag on, and  so driving around late at night, up and down the streets and that. You   re  inevitably going to get stopped. So, immediately, when I get stopped, I  wouldn   t want to tell them that I was working for a U.S. senator so I go  into my dumb-Okie routine. (Laughs) And it worked every time     Well,  you know, I   m just up here   where is that Capitol at?       Sir, you know,  you   ve gotta go       (Laughs) It   d work every time. So, anyway, I didn   t  get any tickets. They felt sorry for me, anybody that stupid. I didn   t tell  them who I was, they   d see the tag. The Chamber of Commerce  probably wouldn   t appreciate it, but that got me out of some tickets. I  shouldn   t be telling these things, should I? (Laughter)  29  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Well, then, your first day going into the office to work for Senator  Bellmon     Actually, I don   t remember that, but on a serious note, what I do  remember that was really important, was   and one of the most troubling  issues that confronted Bellmon, was the whole issue of integration in the  public school vote and bussing votes. I don   t know if people talked to  you about that?  Go ahead.  Have they?  No, go ahead.  Okay. Bellmon   before I had arrived, just shortly before, a week or two,  just shortly before, had voted on an amendment to a bill. The  amendment, basically, would   ve prohibited the federal courts from  issuing remedial actions, or issuing actions, to force school bussing to  achieve racial integration. Well, that turned out to be probably one of the  votes that you talk about in Bellmon   s career. That has to be one of the  landmark votes, along with the Panama Canal and a few others, but that,  at that time, was critical. I don   t know what his thinking was at the time  of the vote. I wasn   t there.  The amendment basically   and it was a very political amendment.  Actually, that provision of the law, I can   t cite the case, but it had been  litigated up to the Supreme Court, and I think Congress had passed that  before, and it had been struck down by the Supreme Court as illegal  infringement upon the power of the Federal Courts to issue remedies to  address a Constitutional wrong. But because bussing and integration was  such a political hot button, you would find these political votes. So  people would throw   particularly, Senator Jesse Helms, Jesse Helms  and others, would throw these amendments out and force these votes,  which really, even if they passed, the Supreme Court would throw it  down. They really had no effect at all other than to posture yourself for  the voters back home. Make sense?  Yes.  One of those votes had come up in the Senate, and Bellmon went over  and voted    no    against it. Well, at the time that that was going on, here  in Oklahoma City, Judge Bohanon had issued the bussing order that had  forced the segregation of all the public school systems here by  transporting students across school district lines. And, of course, that  30  was an historical vote. It caused wide flight in the buildup of all the  suburban areas around the city, and much has been written and said  about that.  When Bellmon voted    no    there was a huge avalanche backlash from  the public here, angry about it. And I remember, the first thing I  remember in the Senate   I was only there for a short time, a week or  two   the mail started pouring in, just tons and tons of mail. It was hate  mail, awful mail, calling him everything,    nigger lover,       bus Bellmon,     every hateful, imaginable thing. It was not much support for him, I don   t  think. I mean the people that wrote were very strife, and it was all stirred  up by the newspapers, and everything else and what was going on in  Oklahoma City. I think, but I   m not sure, but I think when he came back  to speak here, they even had some people, patrolmen and people, out at  the Republican Convention to ensure his protection, because the climate  was terrible. And there was a lot of people upset, right or wrong, but  that   s the way it was.  What I remember was one day there were three bags of these   the big  old mail bags that were just chuck-full of thousands, hundreds  of pieces  of  mail, just huge. And so I was asked, along with another fellow, to  haul those mail bags   there were three of them   down to his little car.  And we did. He took those home. Then the next Monday morning, he  had a house in Alexandria, he stayed there. And the next morning,  Monday, I went down and got those bags out of the car, brought them  back to the office, and he went in and dictated one response.  Well, we called Mrs. Bellmon, said,    What did he do all week? What did  he do with all that stuff?    She says,    Well, Henry sat in his bed all day  long for two days, all weekend long. And he   d take one of those bags of  mail, and he   d dump them on one side of the bed, scoop up some letters,  read the letters, put them back down in the envelopes, and put them on  the other side of the bed. And he read every one of those letters.    He  came back and dictated a response defending his position. And,  essentially, his position was   and I can tell you about this bussing vote  and some things that I tried to do that reflect on his real thinking   but  his essentially was that if we were going to end   I tried to persuade him  about the legal stuff. I was a lawyer. That look, this was a foolish vote.  That it was just political folly, and I tried to, when people called in, to  turn it on the fact that he wasn   t going to engage in this hypocrisy of this  vote. But that really wasn   t Henry Bellmon. That   s Charlie Waters  trying to defend Henry Bellmon because I didn   t care about the issue as  much as I cared about the person. I wanted him to get reelected.  But what he really cared about was integration. And he would say things  like,    Charlie, first of all, Oklahoma City school district drug their feet  31  for a long, long time, and then finally the judge was forced to issue an  order. They came in with the plan,    and he had studied it. And I can   t  tell you   I have never studied it, but he had. And he said,    If we   re  going to have integration in this country, it   s got to start with the young  people.    He says,    My generation is one thing, but we   ve got to start  with the young people, and the school system is the best place to have  that happen.    That   s just the way he felt.  Well, the Republican Party and all kinds of people were upset with him.  They were all upset with him, and this went on and on into   the time  kind of merges, but we   re approaching the    74 campaign and race. And I  was more concerned, I was just this young fellow, and I was more  concerned about the politics than I was the position. I wanted him to get  reelected. I didn   t care about integration or segregation. I shouldn   t say  that. I guess I did, but I wanted that man to get reelected. And he had all  these republicans and everybody mad at him, and he was standing up for  this principle.  So, anyway, some months passed. I don   t remember when, but there was  a senator from Maryland called Mathias, who was a republican, I  believe. Yes, he was. He was a liberal republican. But Mathias was  having the same political problem. And so, Mathias    approach was, he  had   I   ll tell you why I remember this. Mathias    approach was he would  come with some amendments that would put what he would call  reasonable restrictions on what a federal court could do. That you could  only bus them so many miles or you could only do this or that. I forgot  what the amendments were, but Bellmon had gone back to the farm.  And I became aware that Mathias was going to offer these amendments  on the Senate floor and was going to introduce it and was looking for co-sponsors.  I got a hold of that stuff and thought,    This is the answer to his  problem. This will make him look reasonable.    I had a political view of  this.  So, I said,    This is the answer to his problems. This is a moderate view.  It doesn   t shut it down, but it does this or that.    Well, I was wrong, but  that   s what I thought at the time. I was twenty-eight. So I wrote him a  speech. I had all the stuff. I had it all laid out. And I said,    When he gets  into town, we   ll be good to go.    So what would usually happen is, Henry  would fly into Dulles Airport or one of the airports or the National  Airport, and one of the men on the staff, we   d just kind of take turns  picking him up and getting him to the house. Well, I volunteered to do  that, and the good news was that he was flying into Dulles. And that  meant that I had forty-five minutes in the car. And I also know   now, he  wasn   t getting in until midnight or late at night, and that was perfect  because he would   ve slept on the plane so he   ll be well-rested, and I   ll  have him for forty-five minutes, and by Monday morning, we   ll have  32  Finchum  Waters  our problem solved. Does that make sense?  Yes.  I remember I picked him up at the airport, and we had a long discussion  all the way to his house. I explained to him about Senator Mathias     proposals, in detail, and how I had this speech, and we   re good to go,  and what a great thing it would be. Well, I forgot what he said, but his  response was he started telling me how important it was to have  integration in our society. (Laughs) And he went through this whole  spiel that I already heard many, many times. And I wasn   t getting  through to him. And I thought I was pretty persuasive. I wasn   t scoring  any points at all  Does that make sense? He wasn   t buying it. So I step  up the heat one more time and I say,    I forgot something,    I said. And  then he said,    Well, Charlie, if I listen to you, I shouldn   t      he said,    If  I took your advice, you   d make me look like David Hall talking out of  both sides of my mouth at the same time.    (Laughs) I remember he said  that. David Hall probably wouldn   t appreciate hearing that, but that   s  what he said.  So, anyway, we   re coming down near, in the residential street. I had  exhausted myself arguing the merits of this thing, and I said,    All right,  Senator, the bottom line is that the people of Oklahoma do not agree  with you. They do not agree with you, and if you don   t change your  views, you are not going to get reelected to the United States Senate.     And we pulled up to his house. He looked at me. He says,    Charlie, I  don   t know if you   re right about that, but I   ll tell you one thing. I will  not be responsible for setting back integration in this country in any way.  I do not need a damn political job that bad,    got out of the car, walked  in. And needless to say, that   s the last time I argued with him about that  position. I remember that.  I was very young and brash, and I would always tell him what I thought.  And he was a very stubborn man. He had his own opinions and ideas,  but I guess he liked it because I would always go in and tell him what I  thought. I said to him many years later, as I got older, I thought,    I don   t  know how he put up with me for so many years,    because I have people  now that work for me and some of them will come in and tell me where  I   m goofing up and what I   ve done wrong. And I realize they   re the  most valued employees, because you know exactly what they think. You  may not agree with them. You may not even like hearing from them.  And it may be annoying from time to time, but it   s certainly valuable. I  didn   t know that until later. I used to say to him, I says,    I have some of  these people. I don   t know how you put up with me when I was so  young. And, of course, I knew so much then.    He   d just laugh.  33  Finchum  Waters  The thing about him that was so valuable to me on his character is the  way he went about making decisions in the Senate. Today, I look at the  political scene and it   s like nobody knows how to position themselves  until they take a poll. I mean, you look at the national scene. I mean, it   s  not always that. People have certain core values and ideas, if they   re  republican or democrat and government spending, big government, and  all that. But I mean, all the things that come up   look how people shift  their views from one thing to another. It   s all based on polling data, but  that wasn   t Henry Bellmon. He always thought you ought to do what  you think is right. And it played itself out behind the scenes many,  many, many, many times. And it made a big influence on me.  I became the legislative director, which meant I was in charge of  coordinating his program. I was young to do that, and I hired a lot of  youngsters. I   ll tell you a story about that. What I would do is I   d kind of  coordinate the activity and make sure that people were assigned to all his  committees and the things that he was involved in, like agriculture and  the budget, and when we had specialists. I just saw my job as to  coordinate all that and make sure it got done, not be the specialist  because I couldn   t be. And then I would take for myself the leftover  stuff, which turned out to be really the political hot buttons, because they  were things that came up. From my view, there were probably about six  or seven positions that if you positioned yourself in the correct sort of  way, voters in the state would think you   re doing a great job. You could  name the issues, the big political issues. But every day, there were  decisions that had to be made that the public wasn   t watching. It   s up in  Washington. Now, maybe today, with the cable news and all, I   m sure  there   s a lot more scrutiny than there was in those days. And so if you  were a politician, you would either take a vote after you did a poll or  behind the scenes stuff, you would do kind of what the folks wanted you  to do that gave you the money and gave you support. You see what I  mean?  Yes.  Not Henry Bellmon. He was an enigma. I would go in and I   d say,     Senator so-and-so is coming up on the floor of the Senate.    And he   d  say,    What do you think?    I   d say,    Well, we got all these cards and  letters. And the trial lawyers don   t this or this or that.    He says,    No, no,  no, no, no. What do you think of the proposal?    Like that was  important? (Laughs) I had to learn that it wasn   t the politics, but it was  the merits of the position. And he said to me once, he said to me many,  many, many times, and it really impacted my life   he says,    Charlie,  never worry about the politics of anything. Just do what you think is  right, and the politics will take care of itself.    He said,    Just do what you  think is right.    So I would argue with him about positions and very  34  Finchum  Waters  seldom would he ever change his mind. And while I didn   t agree with all  the positions he took, I admired the way he made his decisions because  he did them doing what he thought was right for the country and the  right thing to do. And, really it   s hard to know exactly. Just because you  got a bunch of letters in from a segment doesn   t mean it   s in the public   s  interest, does it?  No.  It doesn   t mean it   s the right thing to do. But it might mean it   s the most  politically advantageous thing to do. I met with him daily. Personality  types   I   m a big talker, and he is not so he had to show a lot of patience  with me. He used to make a joke. He   d say,    Now, Charlie, every time  you ask Charlie the time of day, he   d build you a clock.    (Laughs) So he  was pretty concise. He had a great gift. He could sum up the most  complex issue in a couple of sentences, and he had a real gift about  doing that   none that I   ve quite acquired. He put up with a lot of my  stuff. But he would always say,    Charlie, just do what you think is right  and don   t worry about the politics.    That   s the way he operated.  I remember one day   I just happened to remember this because I  thought,    Here      he was up for reelection. It was    74, and there was a  bill that was in Senator Eastland   s judiciary committee. And I can   t tell  you what the substance of the bill was. I can tell you kind of what was  driving it. The bill was to exempt the bottling industry from some of the  anti-trust laws, perhaps, and there had been some Supreme Court ruling  that affected the bottling industry. Now, I can   t tell you how or to what  effect, but that   s what drove this thing. The bottling folks had gotten  together, their lobby group, and they were trying to get fifty-two  senators to sign up for Eastland   s bill. I think it was in Eastland   s  committee. I don   t know if it was his bill or not. If it was his bill, he was  the chairman of the committee, so it was probably going to go  somewhere.  Bellmon had several things he didn   t do. He never co-sponsored a bill  that did not go to one of his committees, that went to some other  committee. Co-sponsoring bills was a nice political thing to do, to write  in and say,    I   m sponsoring some legislation. It may be going down the  tubes somewhere.    But he never did that because he never knew exactly  what was going to happen to that bill when it went into the committee.  He had no control over it, and so he just never would do that. He   d have  his name on there, and he didn   t want his name on something that  would, you know    So he would never do that, although it was a  common political thing to do. You had somebody come in, you put your  name on a bill, look like you   re active in doing something. See what I  mean? Just cosmetic political stuff.  35  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  I remember one day, the bottling folks came from Oklahoma County,  and they had been big supporters of his. I knew some of them were.  They were people that had raised money, who had gone out and  campaigned for him. There was a whole roomful of these folks. I was in  the room with him, probably twenty people. And they said,    Well, we  came. We wanted you to support this bill.    Well, Dewey Bartlett was  going to sponsor and support it, I think they said. He went through his  deal. He said,    Well, I make it my policy that I don   t sponsor legislation  that I have no control of. I   m on the agriculture committee, interior  committee. I   m not on these other committees, and I don   t have any  control over what happens, so I just don   t do that. But if it comes out     when it comes out   I   ll take a hard look at it before we vote. If it goes  on the floor of the Senate, I   ll take a hard look at it then and see what it  does.     Well, no, that wasn   t enough. They came back, and they kept pushing  him. I forgot he had responded. And finally, he said,    The bottom line is,  I   d read this bill because you were having this meeting. I read this bill,  and I don   t understand why anybody should be exempt from the anti-trust  laws, least of all the Coca Cola company. (Laughs) I don   t see why  you should get an exemption, so I don   t favor it.    (Laughs) Well, you  know what? People talk about profiles of courage in terms of the big  public votes, the Panama Canal vote, or the bussing vote. But I think of  profiles of courage is when you do what you think is right, and he had  nothing to gain and everything to lose because the only people that  really cared were the people there in the room, and they were all his  supporters. But he said no, because he didn   t think it was the right thing  to do. That make sense?  Yes.  That   s the way he always operated. So I tried to pass that on to my staff.  Let   s just do what   s right and not worry about the political outcome.  While we   re still talking about the Senate, do you want to talk about ice  cream?  Oh  Oh, and his speeches.  The speeches, yes.  Now, Henry Bellmon was an excellent writer. What we would do, as  legislative assistants, if he were going to make a speech or something,  we   d draft out a speech. Then we   d give it to him, and he would edit it.  But what we found out about him, he had so much going on, so we   d  36  work on his floor statements. That   s what we called them. They weren   t  like speeches to the Rotary Club. These were really kind of meat and  potatoes, why we   re going to take this position, and all that. And we  would get his positions in the record. We   d make copies and send them  out to constituents, or whatever. That was what we did. And plus, they  were like debate so I had wrote a bunch of those. I wasn   t that great, but  Henry Bellmon was a good writer, and he would edit those things. He  would go through with his little pencil and he would edit those things,  and then we   d have to retype them all. It would   ve been a lot easier if  we   d had a nice PC in those days.  But, we didn   t so I   d give him his speech, and I passed it on to my staff.  I said,    Now, only let him edit his speech one time because if you give  him his speech before he has to give it, he will start making changes in it  again.    (Laughs) I remember we   d write out this thing. We   d give it to  him. He   d edit it, maybe, the day before, and then come time to go over  to the Senate floor. We   d get on that little train and get over there. Well,  I made it a point that I would never hand him a speech until we got on  the floor of the Senate, because then he would edit. I didn   t want it  edited. You understand? One edit   s enough. Well, if you gave it to him  in the morning, then you were really in bad shape. Then you had to  retype the whole thing. It was a mess.  I remember his speech writing. He was a great writer, but I think he just  had so much work. You give him something, he   d start editing it. And  so, you   d try to write like Henry Bellmon. I had to answer a lot of his  letters, draft them, and I   d usually get, like, it was kind of a unique letter  or something. I remember he taught me my writing style. I remember the  first letter I wrote for him. He went through, and it came back to my  desk. And on there, he had circled, had all these circles on this letter.  And he called me and he says,    Charlie, do you know what   s wrong with  this letter?    And he   d circled it. I said,    No.    He says,    You   re using the  personal pronoun,    I   .    He says,    You don   t do that.    So I had to learn to  write without using the personal pronoun    I,    for obvious reasons. I   m  not a great writer, but you had to learn to write his way. And it was the  best way.  I remember when I took this job as general counsel at DHS  Department  of Human Services , somebody wrote me a big letter, and it came from  the finance division, down. I did the same thing to them. I circled all  the   I sent it back, and they still talk about it. You don   t write a letter  using the personal   if you can say it without using the personal pronoun     I,    you do it. Does that make sense? You   re a writer. I remember that.  So he was a good writer. What we would do as aides   it   s just like  Senate   you get to know, it   s not that big. It wasn   t in those days. In  fact, I   ve heard Bellmon participate in discussions with other former  37  Finchum  Waters  senators. I think things must   ve changed a lot since he was there in the     60s and    70s, because you soon learned to judge these people. For a  young man, it made a big impression.  The people that were really good people weren   t necessarily people that  I agreed with. For example, one of the guys that Henry Bellmon liked  the most, and that liked him the most, was Hubert Humphrey. And  Hubert Humphrey was a total opposite personality-type than Bellmon.  They had travelled together, I think   they were both on the agriculture  committee together and, of course, Minnesota   s a farming state. Bellmon  knew a lot about agriculture, and I think they, for whatever reasons,  Hubert Humphrey had a lot of respect for Henry Bellmon. I didn   t agree  with Hubert Humphrey. He was a pretty liberal guy, particularly in those  days. And he had run for president, been defeated. In fact, I thought he  was a bad Attila the Hun there back in    68. But you   d see Hubert  Humphrey walking down the hallway with fifty kids trailing him, and  he   d be animated and going a mile a minute, and he   d stick his head in  and say hello to Henry Bellmon. And they made friends over the deal.  So it was things like that. The same token, there were certain guys that I  would agree with, that were prominent, that I thought were pretty big  jerks. But anyway, you would get to see these people as real people.  Like Bob Dole, I love Bob Dole. You know what the great gift Bob Dole  was? You   d have these committee meetings, and the great thing with  being a twenty-eight-nine-year-old fellow following a U.S. senator  around, you got to go places that nobody else would go. I remember Bob  Dole. He   d walk in these closed-door conference meetings, and they  would be at each other, and with humor. He would have them all  laughing, and they would sit down and work things out. That was a real  gift. Actually, Burns Hargis has that gift. He comes the closest to anyone  I know that has that gift. Bob Dole has that gift. Burns Hargis does, too.  He can, with humor, get everyone to sit down and talk and come  together. It   s a rare gift and Bob Dole, I really admired him. And he was  well-loved there in the Senate. The funny thing is, Ford got him to be the  hatchet man guy in the    76 campaign. But really, Bob Dole could do  that, but he was really so much more. You kind of get to see some of  these people like they are.  Well, did you get to meet Howard Baker once you     Oh, yes. Oh, yes, Howard Baker. I did get to meet Howard Baker, sure.  Actually, Baker and Bellmon got along great. I did get to meet Baker,  and I   ve talked to his staff, and I told them how they had done the  campaign thing. Yes, sure. Oh, there   s a whole bunch of them that were  up there at the time.  38  I will tell you the ice cream story. What we   d do, and this was really  kind of neat, you could, if you were a U.S. senator, you could have one  of your aides on the floor of the Senate. I don   t know what the rules are  today, but in those days, you could have one aid on the floor of the  Senate with you. The way that worked is you   d come in the side and  people were there, the gatekeepers and the guards. They knew who was  who. There was a list. You   d get to know all these people. They   d bring  up a little chair, and you   d sit there by the senator   s thing. Then the  senators would all come over and ask you,    Well, what   s Henry doing  today?    or,    What   s Bellmon doing today?    because you would go over  there if he was going to offer a floor amendment or have a major speech.  Then the senators would all come up, and they got to know you.    Well,  you   re Charlie. That   s Henry   s guy.    I was pretty brash. I remember  chewing out Jesse Helms because he was offering another bussing  amendment. I said,    I don   t know why you   re doing this.    I said,    This  thing has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.     (Laughs) He kind of bristled. He wasn   t one of my favorite senators, but  he was a nice man, I   m sure. Henry Bellmon had certain personality  things we knew about. Well, one of his, he got up at the crack of dawn,  and he got into the office five-thirty or six. Well, I was always a  tendency to come in kind of late, so that   s another story. But I remember  the man loved ice cream with a passion. And I remember we had an  amendment to one of the Senate bills, and I was there, and I had worked  very hard on it. It was a very important amendment, of course. It was  really taken from one of his proposals.  I remember sitting there and, of course, everybody has these  amendments, and you   ve got to get recognized in order to call it up. The  majority leader in those days was, I think, Mike Mansfield, and Robert  C. Byrd was the democratic leader. I don   t remember who the republican  was at the time. But in any event, Bellmon was sitting there waiting on  an amendment, and people were jumping up and offering their  amendments, and they   d put it in the record. You had a roll call vote and  that takes, what, fifteen or twenty minutes? We   d been sitting there. I   m  saying,    Well, he just needs to get up and get this amendment over  with.    I   m inpatient with him, you understand? (Laughs) You know?  (Laughs) So I   m losing patience,    We should get the floor and get his  done.    You know? (Laughs)  He turns to me and he says,    Now, Charlie. I think I   m going to go get  some ice cream.    (Laughs) Well, I turned to him and I said,    You can   t  have any ice cream until you get this amendment up, and then I   ll go  with you.    (Laughs) Can you believe I did that? And, anyway, he got up  and said,    All right, that   s fine.    So he gets up out of his chair, walks  down to the pit, talks to Robert C. Byrd. He nods. He comes back. He  39  says,    I think we got it done.    Next thing I know,    I recognize the  distinguished senator from Oklahoma, Henry Bellmon.    He gets up, and  he takes my speech, and he   s already written out on a note card what he  wants to say   extrapolates some of the speech. He says,    All this does is  this.    They start calling the votes, and I think it passed. I think it did  pass. And he said,    I   m now going to go get my ice cream. You want  some?    I said,    Sure.    (Laughs) He said,    That didn   t happen.    I said,     I   m sure it did happen.     I told him that story once. He used to laugh. I   d tell him these stories on  himself and he   d say,    I   m not sure that happened.    I said,    Who   s going  to argue with me? (Laughs) It did happen.    The Senate moved too  slowly for him. I mean, he thought the legislative process was pretty  boring, I think. He never was at home in Washington, I don   t think. His  home was the farm and the wheat fields and the people back here. Mrs.  Bellmon got involved with the Senate wives, and that was nice. They   d  have them all over. He didn   t like certainly the cocktail circuit or the  lobbyist stuff, but I did. I was twenty-eight years old and single. And so  he would have all these invitations to all these functions. The first of    73,  I think I went to about six functions a week. (Laughs)  There was a group of young people from Oklahoma there from the  congressional delegation. We   d get together, and we   d go to these   one  of these functions, eat too much, maybe drink too much, I don   t know.  And I think I put on twenty pounds the first year, and I had to go on a  diet. I wish I   d done it now, but anyway, I did because I just did all his  Bellmon functions. He   d never go unless it may be a big thing, like the  Banker   s Association or something. It was a fun time. A lot of things  happened. That   s the ice cream story. Oh, and what he   d do if he wanted  to escape. He would get up early. He   d get there early, and he   d be  waiting for me when I   d get in there about eight or nine because by then,  he   d done a day   s bunch of work. But I   d stay there late.  But anyway, when he   d get tired, they had the Senate cloakroom. And  they had this place, this one room, and I   m sure they must have it today.  And he would go over there and the rule was nobody was to go in there  but senators. Okay. And so, he knew that he could escape and go take a  nap and doze off for a few minutes. He   d go in the cloakroom. Well, you  needed him, and you didn   t have cell phones. And so I made friends  with some of the   what do you call them? The pages. So I would tell  these pages,    Henry Bellmon   s in there.       Yes, he is.    They could go in  there quietly. I said,    You go in there, and you stomp by Henry Bellmon  until he wakes up, and then tell him I was looking for him.    (Laughs)  We had to blackmail the pages to make sure he couldn   t go get his nap,  because there were times we needed him. (Laughter)  40  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Did he have a favorite flavor, ice cream flavor?  I don   t know. You would have to ask the girls. But if you went over to a  party at his house, he would churn, and they   d make ice cream. We went  to many parties at the Bellmon farm and over at his house. When it came  to socializing, he had good, close friends that had been with him for  years, but he loved his staff, and he enjoyed spending time with them.  Home-churned ice cream.  Oh, he liked that. And Mrs. Bellmon   he would do that. I just remember  the ice cream thing. I can   t believe I was that impetuous. (Laughter) Can  you? Henry Bellmon kind of defied   how do you label Henry Bellmon?  As a politician, a conservative, liberal, moderate? I mean, how do you  do that? I used to say, because when people would ask what kind of  republican you are, I would always say,    I   m a Bellmon republican.     And, to me, that meant something, but as the years have gone by, I   m  not sure that means so much to people. He passed away a couple of  years ago and had been out of office for twenty years. But to some  people, they understood what that meant. And he kind of took it issue by  issue. On one issue, he might be conservative and the Republican Party  might have agreed with him. On another issue, he might be liberal and  the Republican Party   maybe the democrats agreed with him or the  liberals or the moderates.  He did not like labels. He didn   t like the label    conservative,    or     liberal,    or    moderate.    He believed in taking it an issue at a time,  evaluating it, and then making your judgment known. If someone else  wanted to label it, it was up to them to figure that out, but it wasn   t what  he did. He would not, for example, decide,    Well, I   m a conservative  and here   s the republican platform, or the demo      whatever and then,    I  will go by and follow that.    He had his own views about things. Other  people have characterized him in many, many different ways, probably  some inaccurately.  I would say that a couple of things are safe, if you look at his voting  record and what he believed in. I mean, he was a fiscal conservative. He  felt very strongly about having a balanced budget, and he had supported  several constitutional amendments to require the federal government to  balance the budget. And what   s going on in Washington today would  just absolutely   he would line up with the strict conservative people,  financially. They created a budget committee while he was in the Senate,  I think in    74, and he was appointed to the budget committee. I think  Pete Dominick, the senator from Colorado, was the minority leader of  that Senate budget committee. Pete Dominick either retired or was  defeated, I cannot remember. Bellmon had the opportunity and moved  41  up to become the ranking minority member of the Senate budget  committee. The chairman of the committee was Senator Muskie from  Maine, and they got along very well. Bellmon was a fiscal conservative.  On the other hand, as you can see, he was a strong believer in the social  rights for people. He was concerned about people and, certainly,  minority groups. And we know his strong stance for desegregation and  for integration. He also was surrounded by powerful women. (Laughs)  He was big on the rights of women and believed that women should be  treated with equal rights. And if you look at his staff, some of his key  people always were strong   he would surround himself with strong  ladies who could make decisions and do things. He was a big believer in  equal rights for women. On equal rights issues and all, some people  might think he   s a liberal. I don   t know. He wouldn   t like these labels.  He wouldn   t care.  New issues would come up from time to time, and I remember  sometimes he would make some of the republicans mad. This was  before he ran for reelection in    74. I remember once, he was a big  believer of legal aid for the poor and thought we ought to fully fund it.  And, as I recall, there were efforts underway to define and cut the  services and funding for legal aid to the poor, and he voted against those  efforts. I remember he got a lot of cards and letters from people about  that issue, and he just couldn   t understand why we would want to cut off  services to the people and not have access to the courts for people who  couldn   t afford them. But it made a lot of people mad, believe it or not.  It probably cost him some support among very conservative people in  the state who he really needed their support to get elected.  In those days, of course, in the    70s, we forget here with a republican  governor and a republican legislature, I mean, you could not get elected  in this state unless you have the support of the democrats. And Henry  Bellmon would tell me that. He   d say,    No, don   t worry about the  politics, but remember you   re upset about making the republicans mad.     He says,    You   ve got to have the support of the democrats to get  elected,    but that   s not what he did. He just did what he thought was  right. It wasn   t always the popular thing to do for a long shot. He was  pretty strong, he didn   t change his mind. I used to argue about things,  but he wouldn   t change his mind.  One thing that was kind of interesting, and he saw it this way, in the  Senate you would have   and I   m sure it   s the same way today   you   d  have people that are all positioned out. You   ve got the conservatives  over here, maybe the republicans, the democrats over here, and you can  predict what they   re going to vote and what they   re going to stand on an  issue two years from now. You understand? Henry Bellmon and people  42  Finchum  Waters  like him were really swing senators. And they came to realize   I   m sure  when he came up   they came to realize that here was a man that voted  and did what he thought was right regardless of the consequences. And  so, he was only one of a handful of people, in my view, that were in that  category. He would have people from the left and from the right, from  the democrats, from the republicans, from all political persuasions trying  to hit him up if it   s a new issue, to see what Henry Bellmon is going to  do. And so, in some ways, because of the way he approached issues, it  empowered him as a junior senator. He had more power, in my view,  than of someone who was all staked out on some position. You see what  I mean?  Sure.  Because he was a swing senator. That   s the way I viewed it. And I think  he saw that. You never knew who would be in his office. One day it  might be Hubert Humphrey, the next day it might be Jesse Helms or  Pete Dominick, or any of the people, if it was a new issue. I remember  that every year they used to have   they   ve changed the law on this, on  setting the salaries for senators and congressmen. I think, now, they have  a committee, and they set the salaries of senators, but I don   t remember  how it was done in those days. But every year or so, he would come up,  and they   d have to vote on whether to increase their pay.  Well, most of those senators didn   t want to vote that way because it  wasn   t very popular. I forgot what U.S. senators were getting paid. And  this is very unpopular to talk about because not many people understand,  but I think a U.S. senator, in those days, was getting paid forty thousand  dollars a year. And that was a big salary. And I know with inflation, I  know I   m not poor, but they had to have a home here, and they had to  have one back. I remember that he would vote for the pay raises, every  time. And I remember some senators would come into him   I   m  thinking of one, I don   t know if I should mention his name   who was a  good Catholic and had five or six kids, and who wasn   t a wealthy  millionaire like Kennedy was or some of those. And he needed the  money, but he couldn   t take the political heat for voting a pay raise.  He   d come in and say,    Henry, you   ve got to vote for this. I just can   t do  it.    And this senator, who had a long and distinguished career, would  never vote for a pay raise, but was always grateful that Henry Bellmon  would because Henry Bellmon could be counted upon to do what he  thought was right. In Bellmon   s view, it wasn   t about making money, it  was about you may need to make the Senate so that people could afford  to come to the high-priced area like Washington, D.C., and live and  carry on the activities. It was a very expensive thing to do. And unless  you had a lot of extra money, it was challenging to do. I remember he   d  43  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  always vote for those pay raises, and those weren   t popular. He did it  because that   s what he believed. Other senators, knowing that, would not  vote for it and let Henry Bellmon take the heat. That   s true. And I  always thought they came to respect him because he wasn   t flashy, but  he was straightforward.  I know Edmund Muskie really came to rely and trust and respect Henry  Bellmon, and they were total opposites. Muskie was getting ready to run  for president and so forth. So, anyway, I don   t know what he was. He  was conservative on fiscal issues and on some issues, maybe some  would say he was liberal. I don   t know. But I just say   I always like to  say,    I   m a Bellmon Republican,    because I think that   s about the  highest   it   s all   and I   d like to be like that, where you do what you  think is right as opposed to what the public opinion polls show. So,  anyway, that   s the way he made decisions. Now, if he were here today  and heard me say all this, he   d say   I don   t know what he   d say. He   d  probably chastise me, I don   t know. But, does that make sense?  So, you   re an independent? (Laughs)  Yes, he   d say   but I am largely conservative, but it doesn   t really  matter. That   s how he posed legislation.  We are going to go into the    74 campaign.  Okay, let   s talk about the   74 campaign. Actually, the    74   let me set  this up and the historians can do this. It   s all history. Ed Edmondson had  run for the United States Senate in 1972. Dewey Bartlett defeated him,  and Bartlett had been the second republican governor, served one term,  and he could actually succeed himself, Bartlett could. He was the first  governor that actually could succeed himself. When they changed the  law to allow a governor to succeed himself, they did it during the term of  Henry Bellmon, and they excluded him. I think that   s correct. I think  that   s the history so Bellmon couldn   t run for reelection, and God forbid  we would ever get another lightening strike, we   d never get another  republican. But Bartlett got elected in    66, beating Preston Moore and  really was a hardworking governor. I think he did a really good job, but I  think he thought that if he just did a good job, he   d get elected.  Along came Hall, David Hall, and beat him in    70. In fact, he thought he  was going to win so much, he thought he   d pull in Judge Thompson,  Ralph Thompson, as his co-runner. They put up billboards. In any event,  Bartlett got defeated, and then he decided that wasn   t going to happen  again. Well, Ed Edmondson was the most popular congressman,  probably, in    72. He had been a congressman from eastern Oklahoma,  that district, for years. In fact, he was known as the second congressman  44  from Tulsa, very popular. His brother was governor and very articulate.  His son, Drew, became Attorney General and D.A. and the like.  Edmondson got defeated by Bartlett so Bartlett came to the Senate in     72, and now we had two republican senators, Bartlett and Bellmon.  They had a pretty good working relationship. They approached things  completely differently. I knew them both because I had worked,  basically, for Bartlett. Bartlett was an engineer by training, and he was a  very detail oriented guy. His legislative assistant was David Russell,  who   s now a federal judge, a senior federal judge. David Russell was  down there, and I was with Henry Bellmon. Well, David and Dewey  Bartlett worked into the nights on some position statement they had to  make and trying to figure out exactly what to say and how to say it.  (Laughs) They   d worked until midnight, late at night. He   d call me and  say,    Well, what   s Henry Bellmon going to do?    I   d say,    Well, I  haven   t talked to him yet. (Laughs) We   ll visit in the morning.    So I   d  go in and visit with Henry Bellmon, something   s coming up for a vote.  He said,    Well, that   s easy. We   ll do this. That   s fine.    He said,    I   ll just  dictate some little deal.    We   d be through in about fifteen minutes. I  always thought it was kind of funny. I   d call David and say,    Here   s  what he   s going to do,    so they just approached things differently.  Dewey Bartlett was very deliberate. Henry Bellmon, I wouldn   t say he   s  impulsive, but he had a hunch what he wanted to do, and that   s what we  did. We didn   t have to spend a lot of time stewing over it. Now, I know  on some votes it wasn   t always that way.  In any event,    74 rolled around, and Ed Edmondson decided that he was  going to run against Henry Bellmon. He really picked a good year to do  so.  The year  1974 was absolutely an awful, awful year for anyone to  be running for reelection. The country, as you recall, that was the year of  Watergate and Nixon   s resignation. I hated that campaign. It was really a  tough, tough, tough time. It was hard to rally the troops. Moral was  down because Richard Nixon and the White House and the whole  Republican Party was going down the tubes. The Watergate hearings  were held outside our office up the stairway. I used to have a friend  there, who worked on the Watergate staff, and she   d call me   she was a  good friend   and she   d call me, and we   d batter around about the  Watergate hearings, as serious as it was. She and I don   t agree,  politically, but she   s a good, good friend. She was on Sam Ervin   s  Watergate committee.  So, those hearings were going on daily, where you were being blasted     Nixon was   and all that   s been written and talked about. But that  created a very stifling and depressing sort of atmosphere if you were a  republican up for reelection, and particularly Bellmon, because Bellmon  had been closely associated and tied to Nixon. I believe in April or May,  45  when they had the graduation at OSU, and that was in    74, Nixon came  and gave the graduation speech. I believe that   s true because it was one  of the few places he could still go and be warmly received, and he was.  But even at that, the Watergate years and all that was going on in those  Watergate hearings made the campaign  hard . Bellmon had received a  lot of public criticism because of his stance on the bussing issue and his  independent thinking and voting on stuff. A lot of republicans were  sitting on the fence and were not motivated, and so it was a challenging  time. Edmondson, meanwhile, was a tough campaigner, was well-funded,  smart, sharp politician. And he was running a very vigorous  campaign so it was a tough time to be running.  The Watergate thing, this is true. Bellmon wrote about it in his book. A  lot of what I   ve talked about Bellmon   s written about. Actually, as I look  back, that was such an historical landmark time in the nation   s history.  To be twenty-nine years old and be that close to all of that was really a  wonderful  experience , and not until I got older did I really appreciate  that experience. But I remember that when Butterfield, I think it was     and everyone will know who   s listening to this   but Butterfield, who  had kept the tape system for Nixon in the Oval Office and was called to  testify before the Watergate committee. He testified that there was this  taping system. I think Baker, Howard Baker, was asking the question,  and that was a bombshell that went off because all the disputed evidence  could now be proven one way or another because Nixon had kept all the  Watergate tapes.  Well, I remember where I was. It   s sort of like one of those events you  remember exactly where you were. That was so monumental and so  striking. There was a Senate cloakroom, and I was in there looking for  Henry Bellmon or something and immediately, all these senators   it   s  not a big room, but probably it would hold twenty, maybe, and there was  TV in there. And I mean, all these senators were just rushing in there,  glued to the TV and sitting there, and no one moved, sitting there just  watching, spellbound, as he laid out this whole taping system that  ultimately did Richard Nixon in. I just remember that. As things would  have it, Bellmon, people have said that in some ways he was a prophet  on this whole Watergate deal. Bellmon, now, was very, very close to the  Nixon administration, had been. He had been his campaign manager in     67, but when he got up there, there was some legislation he wanted. I  think it was an environmental bill of some sort. And, anyway, he wanted  to go see the president about this, and he had to deal with Ehrlichman  and Haldeman. To get the president to talk about things, he had to deal  with Ehrlichman and Haldeman. And he was hearing complaints, and he  had complaints, about the way they were treating the senators and his  associates.  46  Bellmon wrote a story, and I remember as a young politician, I said,     He   s lost his marbles.    But he wrote an editorial and it   s in the  archives. He wrote an editorial blasting the Nixon White House. Well,  he doesn   t blast, but basically the thrust of it was that the president had  surrounded himself with people that were going to do him in unless he  made some changes. Well, he had this Plainly Speaking column, as I  recall, where it got published in the rural newspapers and periodicals in  the state. And he wrote that for, I think, a Plainly Speaking column. I  don   t know what he thought, but he wrote it. And he was, basically,  critical of Ehrlichman, Haldeman, and the White House staff, saying that  they would do in Nixon if he didn   t make changes.  Well, this was in    72 or    73, and the Watergate thing hadn   t hit. I mean,  that hadn   t hit yet. In fact, Nixon had just been reelected. There had been  some stories going, but he got picked up by The New York Times, and it  was blasted all across the country, was this editorial about Bellmon  criticizing the White House staff. And Alan Cromley, who was for many  years the writer for The Daily Oklahoman, I think. Later on, I remember  reading editorials lauding Bellmon for his foresight and wisdom to see  this. Ultimately, Nixon may have done himself in, but the staff certainly  contributed greatly to the whole thing, and that Bellmon really, in some  ways, saw a lot of something coming. I remember that. He wrote about it  in his book, and I remember I was there in some small way.  It was some afternoon and Bellmon called his staff in. It was like late  afternoon, and he called his staff. He said,    I just got a call from the  White House.    And he said,    I   m going to go down to the White House  and meet with the president and some senators.    He said,    I think this is  an historical moment.    He said,    You all stay here and when I get back,  I   ll tell you what happened.    He went down and grabbed a cab and went  down to the White House. It   s been written about. That was the episode  that   s been written about that Nixon had called in, I don   t know how  many   ten, twelve, close associates, and announced that he was going to  resign his presidency. When Bellmon left that meeting, he always  carried with him his little three-by-five cards and a pencil or pen, and he  jotted down notes and everything that he could remember that transpired  at that meeting. When he got back with his staff, he pulled that and gave  us a complete briefing of everything that had happened at that meeting.  He   s written about it in his book, and historians have written about it as  well.  As I look back, we were there just at the moment in some way. It   s  pretty cool, pretty interesting. I remember Bellmon telling how Nixon  talked, about that he   d broke down, really, and he did not really  understand. He said he had to have a lot of strength to pull himself  together and walk a few feet behind the curtain and go out and read his  47  Finchum  Waters  resignation speech. Nixon talked about how he had let his close  associates and people down, but that he was having to do this, his  reasons for doing so. That was interesting time to be there, wasn   t it?  Yes.  So, now, Nixon   s out and Ford   s in. The polls were showing we were  way behind. But Henry Bellmon was also a very optimistic sort of guy.  (Laughs) He was an optimistic person. Another thing about him, he was  not thin-skinned. You know what I mean? People would blast him for  something, criticize him. I   d say,    You need to go out      he taught me a  lot about politics in my twenties because I would go in and say,    Why  don   t you go do this? Why don   t you go do that?    And he   d say,    No,  no, no.    Sometimes he   d say,    I   m not going to respond. That just plays  the story twice. It   s not worthy of response. It   ll go away. It doesn   t  matter. It   s not that important.    So he taught me that if you   re in the  political arena, the first question always is, do you even respond at all?  I   ve seen people in the political arena that are so thin-skinned that every  time they get criticized, they think they have to bounce back. It   s a  judgment call. But Henry Bellmon was tough-skinned. He said,    Just do  what you think is right and don   t worry about the criticism. It   ll take  care of itself.    Things start coming to mind, but I remember one  Saturday, I was working up there, and he was in. He called me in, and I  went in and said,    How are you doing?    We just wound up visiting. He  says,    Charlie, what are you going to do when you get through working  here for me?    Well, I had my law degree, and I hadn   t planned to leave,  and he wasn   t inviting me to. He was just talking,    What are you going  to do?    And then he started reminiscing.  He says,    You know      and I   m probably going to get this a little wrong,  but it   s all been recorded. He said   there was a time, I think it was  before he went into the service, he and his brother or he and a friend of  his went around   he says,    You know what I would do if I were      he  said,    You know what I did?    He said,    We worked our way around the  country and we did all these   we took odd jobs, and we saw what  people were like, what happened.    He took this time out of his life. I  forgot how that happened, but it   s been recorded. And he said,    You  know, that was really a great experience.    He says,    You know what I  would do if I were you? Just something to think about.    He says,    When  you think it   s time to leave here, before you do anything, you might just  take   you   re a single fellow. You just might take some time off and go  around the country. Take an odd job, do this, stay a while, go on to  someplace else. When you get tired of all of it, then you can decide what  to do with the rest of you career.     48  Finchum  Waters  Finchum  Waters  Well, at the time he proposed that, I thought,    Now, isn   t that the most  idiotic thing in the world to do?    (Laughs) I said,    Why would I do  that?    Well, you know when you   re twenty-eight, you think a year or  two is a long time. But as I   ve looked back and grown older, there was a  lot of wisdom in that. And maybe if I   d have done something like that,  no telling what would have happened. But he was just reminiscing about  what he had done and how that had affected his life. We talked about a  lot of things and it   s kind of hard to remember everything.  Was it a hard decision for him to decide to run the second term for the  Senate?  Actually, that   s a good question. He had a hard time deciding to run for  reelection, and I know that he thought about it a great deal. I wonder  where this is. I saw on his desk once, before he announced, he had a  list   he did   that shows you how he thought about it. And I probably  shouldn   t have looked at it, but I did. He had a list, and he said,    pro and  con.    He had written out all the reasons he should run and all the reasons  he shouldn   t. But at the end, he decided to run for reelection. Actually,  what race was      74, he decided to run. I don   t know how that balanced  out. I don   t know. I wish he were here to tell about it.  Well, anyway, that   s in Henry Bellmon   s book. Half of it   s on the  cutting room floor that you couldn   t publish, but it   s a great book.  (Laughs)    74 campaign   actually, the momentum changed, I think, in  the last two weeks of the campaign. I think The Daily Oklahoman, the  other papers suddenly realized that they were going to wake up with Ed  Edmondson as U.S. senator, and they didn   t want it. And I think the  republicans were thinking,    He may be for integration, but he   s better  than that other guy. That liberal guy, Edmondson, who is tied to  organized labor, and all that.    That   s how they ran against him. And he  did it that way. And so, he got elected.  Was the youth   the group that you had worked with for the first time  around, was it as active the second time around?  No, no it wasn   t. And I wasn   t involved in that. I was in Washington  then, and I was doing the legislative staff and was on the payroll. I was  not back here to even campaign. I think the last few weeks I took off. I  kind of had to be careful about payroll, I think, issues. I think I came  back, and I organized bus tours, and we went around the last few weeks.  I remember they had some poll results, somebody did. They weren   t  good. They were showing him losing. I forgot who had those. I think the  debate was,    Well, has anybody told the senator?    Well, the question  was,    Why tell him, because he   s not going to believe them.    (Laughs)  You know what I mean? I mean, I don   t know if Henry would agree  49  with that or not. But, I remember that. I saw them, and they weren   t very  good.  When the vote came in, the race was very, very close. Bellmon had won  by a little over 3,000 votes, statewide, which was less than one vote per  precinct. It was a cliffhanger. I can   t even remember where I was at. It  wasn   t really decided until late. I   m sure there was a lot of scrambling  going on about guarding the ballot boxes and all that sort of stuff. In  those days, people would worry about things like that. We had people  assigned to go to local precincts and all that. Less than one vote per  precinct. I   ve got all this information because I didn   t realize, but then,  really, that race then defined what I was involved with for a year and a  half of my life because I was still a chief legislative assistant, and  Edmondson persisted in an election challenge that lasted until March of  1976. And to his persistence, he was able to keep this thing, then,  certain, this vote, the race, in question in some way for a long time.  What happened was, in Tulsa County   now, I can   t remember the  details, it   s been so long ago. But Edmondson   to vote a
