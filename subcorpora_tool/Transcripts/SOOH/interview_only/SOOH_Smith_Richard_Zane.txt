 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday March 31,  2015. I   m interviewing Richard Zane Smith as part of the Oklahoma Native  Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program  at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Richard   s home in the country, just  outside of Wyandotte. Richard, you get this amazing, often eye-fooling effect  from your technique of working with long, thin strings of clay that you hand  press into various textures. Your work is handled by several premiere  galleries. You   ve been collected by museums. You landed here in part  because of your Kansas Wyandotte heritage, but besides working in clay,  you   ve been very involved with Wyandotte language reclamation among  other cultural activities. Thank you for letting me talk with you today.  Smith (Speaks Wyandotte language) Richard Zane Smith. (Speaks Wyandotte  language). I introduced myself in the Wyandotte language. My name is  Sohahiyoh in Wyandotte. I   m of the Bear Clan. I   m a Wyandotte man, and I  also said that this day, today, I   m happy that you   ve come and that you   re  here. It makes me glad that I can do it.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Smith Actually, I was born in an Army hospital in Georgia, which I probably spent  about, I don   t know, maybe six months at. That was in Augusta, Georgia.  Little Thunder Were you not well when you were born, or are you talking about     Smith Oh, no. I was like a seven-dollar baby in the Army. My dad was in the  Army, so actually my sisters were cheaper. They were five dollars each.  (Laughter) They didn   t have that little extra two-dollar job that they did to  the boys, which is a scary thing. I grew up, though, in Ballwin, Missouri,  actually. It was a little new suburb at that time, these tiny little houses  actually made for vets coming back from the Korean War. It was kind of a  neighborhood a lot like this as far as the same kind of trees and the same  5  flora and the creeks and the ponds and all that. Until I was fourteen, I was  raised out there. In 1969, my folks moved into the city of St. Louis, which  was a shock for me. It was a little difficult. I never really got used to the  city, although I did the best I could, learned a lot. That   s where a lot of the  art started, in there. I was doing it before. I wasn   t really that great with  academics. Seemed like whenever the art cart came along, I was in my  element. (Laughter)  Little Thunder You kind of mentioned what your father did for a living, initially. He was  working for the military. Did he stay in that position, or did he     Smith No, I actually can   t remember whether he was drafted or whether he just put  in a couple years to get started. He was an artist. He really wanted to make a  living at it, and he did for several years. Worked independently as a book  designer. He also worked for McGraw-Hill at times and some other  publishing companies, but it was always a little tough growing up because  my mom stayed at home. She didn   t work. There were five of us kids, but  almost every night they would read to us, and we   d sit around a little coffee  table, all five of us kids. They   d put out the paper and pencils, and we   d  draw while my folks would read to us. Sometimes we would be listening.  Sometimes we   d go off on our own world, but whatever, it was a very quiet  time. I always remember that as kind of a very warm, good feeling.  Little Thunder That   s a wonderful idea to combine reading and drawing.  Smith Yeah, yeah.  Little Thunder It sounds like your mom was sort of a natural educator.  Smith She was. She was very sweet, very sweet when we were growing up. There  were times when we   d be stuck in the house because it was nasty out, and  they couldn   t say,    Go outside and play     We   d be stuck in the house, and  we   d be fighting, and she would start crying. She would just start crying.  We   d all stop fighting, and she   d say,    Sometimes you seem like you hate  each other     (Laughs) That was all it would take  (Laughter) We were like,     Oh, my gosh, we made Mom cry     (Laughs)  Little Thunder How about siblings? How many siblings?  Smith There were five of us. I had two older sisters who were twins. I came along  very quickly after those two were born, so I know I wasn   t planned.  (Laughs) Then I have two younger brothers. One of my sisters has died. She  died in    88. We have a great time when we   re all together, but it   s not like  we write or call all the time. We have kind of a different family thing. When  we all get together, we have a riot. We might not see each other for a year,  and that seems to be fine.  6  Little Thunder And the Wyandotte is on your mom   s side?  Smith Yes.  Little Thunder Can you talk a little bit, just briefly, about how the Kansas-Oklahoma  Wyandottes came to be?  Smith That   s a big story, so I   ll try to wrap it up. Obviously at the Removal, the  Wyandotte Removal, the Wyandottes were the last tribe to leave Ohio. They  didn   t plant that year because they had been promised that they would   have  left. They waited, and they waited until it got to be fall. They finally  were given the okay to go, to leave. Those who were traveling by steamboat  packed up wagons and walked and went by wagon all the way to Cincinnati  where they caught steamboats. The ones who wanted to keep their cattle and  horses, they had to go overland, but they all came and got to Kansas area.  The details of that trip are all written down, which is kind of interesting. It   s  really interesting to hear, but they settled Kansas near the Shawnee and the  Delaware. When they got there, the land that they had been promised was  already taken, so they had to buy some land. The Delaware (I believe it was  the Delaware, maybe it was the Shawnee) gave them a large parcel, too.  Some years after, though, the federal government, it declared all the  Wyandottes as citizens.  You couldn   t be an Indian citizen. If you wanted to keep your Indian status,  you had to reapply. Most of those who reapplied for Indian status were those  who ended up here in Oklahoma. Although there were eight families in  Kansas who also did, and that was one of my family, they reapplied to stay  on. We have those written things and why it was important to them. Some of  them   of course, the Civil War was coming and going a lot. Some of the  ones who were in Oklahoma, they would rather be in Kansas, and some of  the ones in Kansas   . There was a lot of going back and forth. The families  are really the same when you trace them back. The Kansas and Oklahoma  families, the Wyandotte families, all come from the same group. Also in  Kansas, the Wyandotte were involved in the Underground Railroad which  was pretty strong in getting those families across, those black families across  the Missouri River and getting them into freedom, freedom area. There   s a  lot of history.  Little Thunder That   s neat. I did not know that.  Smith It   s amazing.  Little Thunder What was your relationship with your grandparents on either side or  extended family, maybe, in Kansas?  7  Smith In Kansas? We always looked forward to it, went to visit once a year. We  lived, of course, in the St. Louis area, so we would take a train out to visit,  and we   d stay a couple weeks. All the Zanes, Zane family, we   d all get  together. My grandpa was always pretty shy, pretty quiet, kind of  withdrawn, although he would stand on his head for us. (Laughter) I  remember that. I remember he always wanted to stand on his head to show  you he could still do it, I guess. He was in his sixties then. I   ll have to  remember that, see if I can still do that. He took me fishing one time. He  also died when I was pretty young, so I didn   t really get to know him very  well. My mom always tells me,    Your Grandpa Zane would be so proud of  you right now, all the things you   re doing.    That always makes me feel good  because so much of my family, they   re interested in their heritage as sort of  a little side issue, but it   s not that deep. It   s not the passion. It   s not the root  of who they are. It   s not in their identity, I guess. It   s more of an interesting  fact. I guess that   s the way it is with a lot of families.  Little Thunder What are your earliest memories of seeing Native art?  Smith Hmm, ones that   s really made a big impression on me, I guess I   ve seen it a  lot. My dad was always exposing us to art books, so we saw a lot of stuff as  we were growing up. The thing that really struck me, I guess, as a young  adult, probably in my teens or late teens, were some of the Arizona  Highways magazines that would come out. I   d see a lot of Jerry Jacka   s  photographs of these incredible   the pots and the things that were being  made. I know Lonewolf, (gosh, names are so terrible to me) Rosemary  Lonewolf and Joseph Lonewolf and Grace Medicine Flower, people like  that who I saw what they were doing, and I was so impressed that they were  taking tradition, doing something different with it. They were stepping out.  Little Thunder What are your earliest memories of making art?  Smith Earliest memories, it seems like it was always there. I   ve got all these  sketchbooks from when I was just a kid. I still have some of them. I was  doing them all the time, and I was making the stuff. I was writing things.  When I was little, I made toys. We   d saw spools for wheels, and we made  trains.  Little Thunder So working three-dimensionally a lot, too?  Smith All the time, yeah. I was drawing and trying to actually do rendering,  having a hard time at it, but still it became a passion.  Little Thunder What were your art experiences, then, in primary school?  Smith Primary school, yeah, that was my salvation. (Laughs) The art cart being  brought into the room, that was it because I felt like I had been   . I probably  8  should   ve been held back because I really wasn   t ready to learn some of the  things that were being taught. I was terrified of the academic, some of the  stuff we were going through, especially math. I just wasn   t able to retain  stuff, but as soon as the art cart came in (rubs hands together),    I   m in my  element now  Okay     (Laughter)  Little Thunder Did you get reinforcement from your teachers?  Smith Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. That helped, of course, too, and getting it at  home, too. My folks were really good about that, both of them being artistic.  My mom, too. She worked for Hallmark, even, for a while when she was  young. She was designing greeting cards and all kinds of things. Both of  them were very talented. They never told us things like,    Oh, but you   re  going to have to get a real job. You   ll have to do art on the side.    They  never said anything like that. It was always,    Follow your dreams, and  someday it might just work out for you.    They always were open about that.  That really meant a lot to me.  Little Thunder How about any art experiences in middle school or high school that stand  out?  Smith Another thing, I must say, in high school that really, really saved me, too,  because it was a stressful time, we had moved into St. Louis,    69, early    70s.  A lot of racial tension at that time, so we were in the middle of it as kids in  school. It was tough. It was very tough to even get any kind of education at  all, but the art classes, we had amazing art classes and great teachers. There  was two or three teachers that really helped me a lot. It seemed like at that  time the high school, University City High School, we had freedom enough  that we could actually talk to other teachers and say,    Well, I   m going to be  working in the ceramics room for two hours or three hours. I   m just going to  be there today.    They   d give permission, and so the next two or three days I  might say,    I   m going to be in the crafts room. We   re doing some welding  and some sculpture or stone carving,    or,    We   re doing some lost-wax  casting.    This is all high school. It   s like they would give you whatever you  wanted to do.  There were some students, of course, in the room that were sitting back in  the chairs, and they   d just want a little social event. The teachers would  ignore them.    Just ignore those people.    (Laughs) They would focus on  those who were fascinated and interested. It was also there, I guess, when  you start getting that reinforcement from teachers who are recognizing  something, and you know they   re recognizing something. It   s not a put-on.  They   re not just saying,    Oh, that   s nice. Oh, that   s nice.    It   s like,    Oh   Wow, that   s pretty good. Let me show you what you can do with that tool.  Let me show you something else you can do with that.    I really picked up on  that. I was also kind of a survivalist kid.    I   m going to make my own way,     9  so I really was. I was a hard worker. I   d wake up early. I did a lot of  leatherwork when I was in high school. I made hundreds of pairs of sandals  to sell. I   d cut the tires, and I made tire-tread sandals and sold them.  Little Thunder And you sold them?  Smith Yeah. In fact, people keep telling me,    I still have a pair of those old sandals  in my closet. I just can   t throw them away.    (Laughter) My mom, she still  wears them. She still wears a necklace that I made her in high school. She  still wears that  She says,    All my grandkids have teethed on it.    It   s just  who I am. It   s aluminum. People think its silver, but it   s   yeah.  Little Thunder What would you say was the first piece of artwork that you sold?  Smith Sold, I don   t know. I guess what comes to mind is when I was at junior  college at Meramec Community College in St. Louis. I would sell pots to  pay for the school so I could go there. We   d put on a little show right at the  house, and I   d have these pots made with.... At that time I was kind of  addicted to the potter   s wheel. I didn   t have much interest in hand building.  It looked too tedious. It didn   t look like something I   d be good at, but I think  it really helped me, actually, that wheel throwing, because it gave me a  sense of symmetry. I would go into the ceramics room and wedge up enough  clay to make fifty little bowls that day because I knew that after that fifty,  it   s like an exercise. You   re exercising it, and then they start coming out,  and they just start moving. They come right out of your hands after that.  Little Thunder Now, when you say you were going to the ceramics room, you   re talking  high school at this point, or are you talking Meramec?  Smith At the junior college, yeah. At high school it was similar, but I think in high  school, they pretty much allowed you to fire anything. I wish that wasn   t the  case. Some of the pieces,    Oh, my gosh, my mom   s still got that.    (Laughs)  Of course, you get into community college, and you have to be careful about  what you are saving. Same thing happened actually at   I went to Kansas  City Art Institute, too, for a year. Same thing. You   d throw all these pots,  lots of pots. I   d have them all over the table, and then you could pick out  maybe five or six for the kiln. It taught you,    Okay, I can live without that  one. I can definitely live without that one. All right, those can go. I want that  one.    You start refining your own sense of what you like and what you   re  drawn to. If you only had five or six pieces on the table, they   d all look all  right, but if you have fifty on the table and you have to pick out five, it  starts   . It   s a way of refining and refining.  Little Thunder It   s hard to get into the Kansas City Art Institute. I understand it   s kind of  pricey, too.  10  Smith It was tough for me, too. I did get a scholarship, but I had to pay for it  myself. My folks couldn   t do it, as much as they wanted to, so I had to work  like crazy to save money to do that. I was fortunate to find a little basement  apartment I could rent for seventy dollars a month, which was really nice.  This older lady who was there   . It was just down the street from the  school, so I could bicycle back and forth, but I was on a limited budget. My  food budget was thirty dollars a month.  Little Thunder My goodness.  Smith When I went over that, (and sometimes I did) I was like,    You spent forty  dollars this month. You can   t do that,    because it was my savings and I  didn   t have   . So these student shows would come up, and of course you try  to sell your pieces at the school. Some of the kids would get mad at me  because they   d say,    You   re underpricing us.    It   s like,    I just need sales  right now     (Laughs) But anyway, that was kind of my school experience  except I also told them,    I   m only going to come here a year, so I   m going to  be a senior and a junior at the same time.    I started to go to all the senior  functions, the junior and senior functions. At that time, it was the  instructor   gosh, my memory. Ken, Ken   . I can   t believe I can   t remember  his name. It   ll come.  Ken Ferguson   He   d be like,    Zane, what are you doing here? This is for seniors.    I   d say,     I told you I   m only coming here one year. I   m getting it all.    So yeah, I did,  and then at the end of the year, I told him, I said,    I have to go. I   m leaving.     He says,    No, I   m your senior       really angry. He   s like,    No, you have to  come back. We   ll make it easy for you. We   ll get you scholarships.    At that  time, I was also   I   d already decided. I think I had had enough, too, and I  was just ready to move on. A degree meant nothing to me. I wanted  information. I wanted to know how to fire kilns. I wanted to know how to  mix glazes, slips. I felt like I had a good   .    I   m ready to do this now.    I  just wanted to do it. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Were you entering any Native art shows at that point or not?  Smith No, that came later. My hand building kind of started   . At the end of    77, I  loaded up my truck from St. Louis, everything I owned, all my tools and  everything I could carry. I   d built a back rack, kind of like hoops on the  back of my truck so I could sleep in there at night, and I just took off. That  was it. I was gone. I had, like, five hundred dollars. I was going to make it. I  could camp for the night, pull over somewhere behind a truck strop, build a  fire, (you could do that back then; you wouldn   t get chased off) cook  something, and move on, just keep going. I did that for a year. Then I ended  up at a little school right off the Navajo reservation. I went there to visit  some people who I had met who were working there. They were teachers,  and they said,    Yeah, if you   re in Arizona, drop by and check it out.    I  11  thought,    Yeah, okay I   ll check it out.    I did. I stopped by. This was in the  summer; the kids hadn   t been there yet. It was a boarding school.  They said,    We don   t have an art teacher this year. It   d be great if you could  come because the kids won   t have an art teacher.    I said,    What do you  have? What kind of materials you have?    They took me to the basement,  and they opened this closet. It   s glitter, bleach bottles, felt, the little eyeballs  that would go like this. I thought,    Oh, this is terrible. Can   t submit these  kids to that art. I   m staying. I   ll stay. I   ll be the art teacher.    I had no idea  what it was going to be like to work at a mission school with that kind of  structure. It   s amazing that I lasted, but I did. They also, because they were  desperate, they put me in charge of the fourth and fifth grade boys as a dorm  parent. I mean, no background check, nothing. They just said,    How would  you like to do that?    I go,    Sure, sure.    (Laughs) I love that age, anyway.  Those kids are just great. They   re still full of life, and they   re curious.  It worked out all right for a while. It worked out for me, but the school  wasn   t real happy. Probably after a couple of months, they decided I wasn   t  being strict enough to the kids. I didn   t make them take a shower every day.  They   d send a boy down to say,    Oh, it   s time for all the kids to get their  haircuts.    I   d go,    Anybody here want a haircut?    (Laughter) It was a  wonderful experience really. It was frustrating working with these religious  fanatics, but at the other end it was incredible because these kids were all  first-speaker Navajo. Navajo   s their first language. They were really Navajo  kids. These were not assimilated kids. These were kids that really came from  the res ervation . These were res kids all the way. Boy, it was really an eye-opener  for me. I   d been exposed to some Cree up in Northern Canada once  when I went firefighting up there. I went up there on a whim, ended up with  a group of Cree up in the bush, and those guys were all traditional people,  too.  It was really the first time that I was around a lot of kids that that   s their  culture. There   s so many things I could share, but one of the things, we were  given fifty dollars for the year for art supplies. Fifty dollars, that was it.  That   s all they could give us. Our salary was fifty dollars a month, too. Of  course, you could help yourself at the cafeteria, and you could dig around  back there, see if you could find something if you got hungry. This was not  any kind of moneymaking venture. (Laughs) With fifty dollars, I had to  really stretch it. I bought beads for the girls. We went down to Phoenix, and  we got stocked up on some looms and beads. I did find a clay place, and we  bought some tools and even some clay. I even went into a place where they  had been mixing clay down there. I said,    Can we have what   s on the floor,     because they had all this white clay that was just on the floor.    Oh, sure.    I  shoveled that up, put it in bags, and we took it up there. They did a lot of  pottery that year, a lot of pottery.  12  It was, like, the first year that we started running out of that clay that we  bought. During the weekends, some of the kids   the parents were supposed  to get them, pick them up. They didn   t always come, so the kids would be  out there waiting, waiting, waiting, and Mom and Dad didn   t come. They   d  be all depressed, and I   d say,    Let   s get in the truck. Let   s go out in the  desert and play cowboys and Indians.    (Laughs) That   s what they do  So  we   d go out there and take watercolors with us, paint up. I   ve got pictures of  these. I   ve got pictures. I can show you some. Running, hooting and  hollering, just running all over the desert, hopping it. Pottery sherds out  there, Anasazi pottery sherds. Well, they don   t say Anasazi now. It   s ancient  Pueblo pottery sherds all over there, and clay, so I started finding stuff. I  thought,    We got to try some of this clay that   s out here.    We   d bring some  home, and I started mixing it. I was like,    This is better than the store-bought  stuff  It actually holds its form. I like this stuff     That   s where it  started.  Little Thunder Without anything to temper it?  Smith I don   t think I was using anything to temper it at first. I don   t think I was  because we were just digging it out of the ground. It did have sand mixed  with it, but, yeah, it was straight like that. Firing was a whole other thing for  me. Of course, we   re hand building; it   s all hand-built. We didn   t have  wheels or anything. I   m away from all my security stuff, the stuff I was  good at. Now I have to start things by hand, and I   m teaching something  that   . I made a few little hand-built pieces like everybody has in high  school, just enough to kind of make you think,    Boy, I   m not good at this.     So many people I   ve talked to have had the same experience. You think,     Gosh, this is a way to inoculate people against pottery. Give them hand  building.    (Laughs)  Anyway, also, that   s where I started to find the corrugated sherds. You   d  pick them up out there in the desert. Looking at it,    How was that done? I  don   t understand it.    First of all, I didn   t understand it because I didn   t know  which way it went. I didn   t know which way those lines went, but I kept  seeing those things and the fingernail, you know, the little fingerprints and  everything. It wasn   t until I found one that had a rim, that rim sherd where  you actually could see. Then I could tell,    Oh, okay. They run this way. Oh,  they   re lapped. They   re shingle-lapped.    You look at the cross-section, and  you could see the little lines like that.  You could see how each coil was lapping the other one.    I got to try that     I  took a sherd back. This is all on the edge of BLM  Bureau of Land  Management  land, but it was on private property. I   d take a sherd back and  say,    I   m going to make a piece like that.    I actually have sherds from my  first one. The pot didn   t survive, but I do have sherds from the idea. You  could actually see how I learned it just from doing that pot because they  13  started getting a little better and a little better as the coils went up. I was like,     Okay, I think I   m getting it. I think I understand this.    Part of the key to  that is good clay. You have to have a clay that gets sticky and sticks to itself  well and holds its form. That   s kind of where it started. That was in    78 and     79.  Little Thunder How long did you stay there?  Smith One season, but that   s where I met my wife. She was a teacher there, fourth  grade teacher. I kind of kept an eye on her because it seemed like the kids  really loved her. They were always hanging on her on the playground,  leaning. All the little girls would be leaning on her. She was watching me  because she   d watch me go across the playground. All these little kids  would get those little metal swings   those little, what do you call them? The  little spinning ones. The merry-go-round   Little Thunder Merry-go-round.  Smith Yeah, they   d say,    Push us  Push us     Sometimes it was the first words they  learned, I think, in English. It was    Push us     I   d go,    Okay, come on.  Everybody on     Vroom, vroom, I   d get those kids flying so fast, some of  them would go flying off, but they were tough. These little kids were, like,  indestructible, man. They were just amazing. If they got scratched or if they  got hurt, they would sort of whimper a little, and then they   d start laughing  because that   s the way they were raised. You pick yourself up. I can   t even  imagine what that   d be now today with all the rules. But she was watching  me, and I was watching her. We started to have this little friendship. We  started to meet together and talk and talk and talk. I guess I was the one  doing all the talking, but, anyway, that   s where we met.  Little Thunder What made you decide to leave, then?  Smith I couldn   t stand working with the kind of people there. There seemed to be a  lot of hypocrisy. Part of it was they didn   t let the kids speak Navajo in the  classroom. I was trying to learn it. I was trying to learn it as fast I can. Kids  would come up and help me, and finally I   m counting. T              , naaki, t      ,  d          , ashdla   , hast    , tsosts  id, tseeb    , n  h  st      , neezn  . I   m starting to  learn Navajo. I like it. I   m starting to get the sounds right. They   re like,     You shouldn   t be fraternizing with the students. You   re a teacher. You   re  not supposed to be sitting there on the propane tank with the kids.    There  was this attitude. There was this attitude that you   re like a sergeant or  something. I couldn   t deal with that after a while. Plus, they were fighting  with each other (I mean the staff) because their religious ideas were different  than this person   s religious ideas. They   d even argue sometimes during a  devotional or something they   re having.  14  I thought,    This is awful.    Another couple of things we tried, which were  different art projects, one of the things I thought was,    This is modern times,  but you   re Navajo. You   ve got modern things. You kids, design a Navajo  soda pop. Put your own design on it, something that you would make if you  were up there,    because everybody was into pop at the time.    Make your  own, and if it   s even written in Navajo (speaks Navajo language).    I   m  trying to get them to think about not just making old things.    Try something  that   s yours but do it in a modern setting. Do something contemporary.     Even at that time when I was making hand-built pieces, there   d be pickup  trucks on them. I was already playing around with those ideas, so I   m  pushing edges. Once I learned the techniques, the ancient techniques, I   m  already starting to push it. I can   t just make reproductions all my life. I know  that   s not going to work.  Little Thunder When did you find your first venue for, as you say, that new technique that  you   d learned of the texture?  Smith That was an amazing thing that happened. That was an amazing thing. We  were, at that time   okay,    84, we   d been married for a couple years. We got  married in that spring of    79. We hit the road, Carol and I, lived off the road.  We didn   t have money. Again, we were only making fifty dollars a month,  so we didn   t have a lot of money. We lived on the road, worked up in  Washington, Idaho, on a ranch. When it got too cold, we went south. We  made pots out in the desert, down south of  Phoenix .  Little Thunder She did, too?  Smith She did a little polishing once in a while, but she wasn   t really into the crafts  thing. She probably did all the worrying for both of us.    How are we going  to   .       Where do we go from here?    When we camped out in the desert, it  was great in the wintertime, but then it starts getting warmer. Sitting under  the palo verde trees is not enough. (Laughs) Also, the critters are coming  out. You   re finding scorpions on your pillow. We were making little pots.  I   d make them, and I   d fire them out there. We   d take them into town and  park at the greyhound track down there in Apache Junction. Park the truck,  put all the little pots on the hood, and,    Eight dollars, please. Six dollars for  that one.    Anything to make grocery money. That   s all we were doing was  just making grocery money.  I   d do a few of the little corrugated ones, but most of them were little  burnished pieces that I   d do little etchings in. They were pretty crude, when  I look at that stuff now. They   re not worth more than six dollars each,  maybe for crushing up. Anyway, that   s where it started, where I was  actually selling pieces that were hand-built pieces. Now, we moved to  Ganado,  Arizona  because we really enjoyed working with Navajo people,  and she   s a teacher. She was trained as a teacher, had a degree, so they  15  accepted her there as a teacher. We moved right in. Eventually we got to this  old stone house that was near the lake. We got to rent that place, beautiful  old house, one of those mud-mortar houses, and I started making pieces by  hand, trying to sell them.  I   d take them to the trading post. First of all, they didn   t know what to do  with me. It was like,    That   s not really Pueblo. What are you?    (Laughs) I  was like,    Wyandotte.       What   s that? Isn   t that a chicken?    (Laughs) They  didn   t know what to do with me. It didn   t really work too well. Like at  Hubble   s. They can   t market stuff at Hubble   s that   s Wyandotte. That was  discouraging. Then I found out about the Heard Museum was doing  something down there in Phoenix at one time. Oh, I was making some big  corrugated ones. The first big one I did turned out really nice. I had a great  flashing on it. I   ve got a picture of that one, too. I had no idea what was  coming. In the picture I   m just standing there like this holding this pot. Had  no idea.  Little Thunder How big was it?  Smith It was about like that, but it was big for me. I   m holding this thing. We  decided,    Oh, let   s take it down to the Heard Museum. They   re having this  art show down there. Maybe I can sell it, make a little bit of money.     Little Thunder But it wasn   t the Heard Market. It was just an impromptu kind of.     Smith I   m not sure because   . It might   ve been, but I didn   t stay. I kind of dropped  it off. They took it all, and they put me in a certain category and all that.  They said,    So what   s your tribal affiliation?       I   m Wyandotte.       Oh, that   s  great  We haven   t had any Wyandottes.    Put it on there. I took off, came  back home, but I was still in the mindset that that   s only going to be  something I do on the side. There   s no way I can do that for a living. I set up  a stoneware kiln out there. I was starting to make cups and bowls and stuff  like I was doing at the school.  Little Thunder You had got yourself a wheel at that point?  Smith Yeah, decided maybe that   s what I should do for a living. I can do  some   but it took a lot of wood to fire a stoneware kiln. I was feeling a little  guilty for that, too, using up   good firewood from the res there. It was one  time when I was firing that kiln, and I was getting about ten hours in the fire.  I mean, it   s when you   re throwing the wood in like this,    Whoo, whoo.    It   s  burning so fast, it   s just gone. I got a call, and it was one of the judges at the  Heard Museum. He calls me up, and he goes,    Yeah, I was one of the judges  down at the Heard Museum, and before I tell you anything, who represents  you?    I go,    Represents me? What does that mean?    He goes,    Well, I have  my own gallery, I was one of the judges, and I thought if you haven   t been  16  represented by any gallery, then I   d like to represent your work. By the way,  your piece got Best of Pottery this year.    I thought,    You got to be kidding  me     That   s how it started.  Little Thunder Did you sell it, too?  Smith Oh, yeah   Little Thunder You have prize money.  Smith Yeah, and it was sold. I actually put three pieces in. The other two I kind of  forget about, but one of them was one of the little polished ones where I had  a little scene around it, kind of a modern res scene around it. I don   t know  where that one   . I have no idea. It   s gone. The other one, the corrugated  one with the corrugated texture, nobody   d seen that stuff before, I guess, or  they hadn   t seen it done like the ancient ones had been doing. Acoma do a  kind of corrugated. It   s not quite the same as what I   m doing. I mean it   s  similar, but it   s different. That   s where it started. From then on   .  Little Thunder What gallery was he with?  Smith Let   s see, what was that gallery? It   s been a long time now. I can   t  remember the name of the gallery.  Little Thunder Was it one there in Phoenix, though, or was it in Scottsdale?  Smith Yes, it was down there somewhere. I   m not sure I actually went to their  gallery before. He would come up and pick up pieces. Right down at Keams  Canyon, in Hopi country there, Bruce McGee had a trading post, and he  found out about my stuff. He would come up, and we started a good  relationship together. He would come over and buy them outright, buy  pieces, or I   d take them down to Hopi and sell my pieces there. He started  taking them down to Phoenix to a gallery that was really interested. It was  Gallery Ten. In the early    80s, Gallery Ten was kind of like this gallery that  was looking for artists that were Native artists that had one foot in the past,  that were grounded in their traditions and their techniques and stuff like that,  but they   re out there trying the new and trying to make that balance, trying  to find that balance.  I guess it just happened to be that I was one of those, so, like I say, I  happened to be at the right place at the right time. People have said,    You   re  really blessed. You   ve been really blessed.    I   m just real cautious about that  because I appreciate it and I   m thankful, but when people say that, it also  makes me think,    Does that mean someone else isn   t?    It kind of gives you  that sense that,    What about those who are artists who are struggling so hard  and they work even harder than I have, and they still aren   t able to make a  17  living doing it? So, what? They aren   t blessed?    I   m kind of cautious about  those words, but I do feel thankful, very thankful.  Little Thunder As you   re really gathering steam then, maybe by the early    90s, are you  dealing with a number of galleries? Are booth shows important to you, or is  it mainly gallery shows?  Smith Galleries, yes. I actually never officially   I went almost as far as applying  to get into Indian Market in Santa Fe, but I never actually got a letter from  the chief here, Wyandotte Nation here. Because I   m enrolled with the  Kansas group, even though we   re in the same family, I don   t have an  enrollment number because it   s all   . Here, the Wyandotte Nation, all their  members come through a certain roll that was taken in the    40s or  something, so if your families aren   t on that role, even if you   re all related, it  doesn   t matter. You   re not on there. We   re on rolls in the Kansas group, the  Wyandot Nation of Kansas, and it is organized. We have chiefs, and we  have secretaries and all that. It   s pretty small, there   s not much going on, but  it   s not federally recognized. It doesn   t mean a thing to me that I don   t have  a card. I don   t even know what I   d do with a card if I had a card, scrape the  window with it or something.  It doesn   t mean that much to me, but it   s one of those issues that, even  though I had the Wyandotte Nation chief  Chief Leaford Bearskin  write this  letter saying,    He   s one of us even though   ,    I didn   t want to use it because  I didn   t even want to get into that politic thing. Plus, there   s something else,  and I   ve gotten even stronger about this later. I   m opposed to competition,  artists against artists. I just don   t think it   s a healthy thing. It   s done some  good. Competitions can do some good, but they do a lot of damage, too,  because only one person wins and there   s a lot of those who don   t. There are  those who collect awards, and they collect them like scalps. They   ll cover  their walls with their blue ribbons, and I think,    Every one of those ribbons  could   ve gone to somebody like me back in    84 when I needed that.    I  needed that little spark. That was really   since then I don   t really enter  competitions. I just don   t feel right about it. I was so happy when I was  down in New Zealand and was down there with a Maori group.  They invited me down. Actually, I   ve been down there twice now. I noticed  that they don   t do competitions in their art shows at all. They think that  would be crazy.    Why would you do that? Why would you pit artists against  each other? We   re here to lift up the young. We   re up here to   everybody  together here on this  We   re all Maori.    I thought,    Wow, we   re missing  something here because we   re caught in that stuff.    It   s a big issue. I know  some people feel strong the other way, so I won   t go into it, (Laughs) but  it   s something that   s important to me because I have never made pieces to  compete. If anything, I   m competing with myself because when I finish a  piece, immediately it takes me to a place where I go,    Next time, I   m going  18  to try this,    or,    Next time I   m going to vary it that way.    Very few pieces  I   ve done that I go,    That   s it. I   m done. I think I can quit now. I   m done.     (Laughs)  Little Thunder Hand-coiled pottery   s already labor intensive, but then there   s your  particular style. That   s got to be so time consuming. How did you know how  to price your work? How did you meet that gallery demand?  Smith That   s a good question. It is. I mean, when we got that request from that first  guy who said,    I want to buy your work; I want to represent you,    I go,     Can I do that for a living? Are you kidding? Rolling those tiny little  spaghetti noodles and flattening them? I don   t know if I   d enjoy it  anymore.    But after a while, it becomes a rhythm like knitting or like  crocheting. You just got to do it. Next thing you know, it   s lunchtime. Then  do it for another four hours, and it   s dinner. You start a pot. If you   re going  to make a large piece, you start it on Monday, and by Friday it   ll be done, or  Saturday.  Little Thunder So you can do about one or two a week?  Smith When this happened I still had that really strong work ethic, so yeah, I took  it as a serious job. Eight o   clock to twelve o   clock, I   m going to be in the  studio rolling coils. I   d break for two hours, do whatever I want, then I   d go  back at it hard until six. That was it. That was what I did. I kept that pretty  rigid. I was really tough on myself about those things. If I cheated, I worked  extra hard on another day. Pricing things has always been tough. It   s  something we work with a gallery about. We   ve seen how some people can  overprice things, and then it becomes a problem. Then we   ve seen  underpricing, too. I don   t want to underprice people, but it   s tough. Yeah, it  really is. You almost have to decide   I stay out of it, personally. I let my  wife do it all  I have no idea what things go for anymore. She   ll tell me.     You got to be kidding. You   re selling it for that?    She goes,    Yeah, you  didn   t know that? Yeah.       No, wow, I had no idea.     Little Thunder So that   s kind of her role in the business.  Smith It is, yeah. She works with the gallery on that. I only get into Santa Fe once  a year during the show. Right before Indian Market, they always have a  show. It   s usually on that morning. Blue Rain Gallery will have a show that  morning, ten o   clock. We   ve been doing that for so long now it   s almost  kind of standard.  Little Thunder Several artists have talked about,    Oh, Richard always has sold-out  shows.    (Laughter)  19  Smith It   s amazing. It is like magic. It is. There   s something about it, but, see, it   s  not just the pottery. People come into Santa Fe. They come to Santa Fe, and  they have a Santa Fe experience. They   re taking home not only a piece of  art, but they   ve had this experience in Santa Fe. I think the gallery has  learned that, too. It   s not like you can take the gallery and bring it to San  Francisco and set it up and try to sell. Sometimes that works, but it doesn   t  work as well because people, they like to come to Santa Fe, and they like the  experience. They save up for it. It   s the whole experience. When they bring  a piece home, it   s not something that,    Oh, yeah, the gallery down the road  has them now.       What? You got to be kidding  They brought them here?        No, you have to go to Santa Fe to get these.    There   s something kind of  magical about it all, and people kind of get hyped up, the show. It   s kind of  funny, but people love it. They love the whole thing. They love this, and it   s  true. Yeah, they do go pretty well. It   s nice.  Little Thunder This ancient pueblo pottery sort of launches you into this textured technique,  but the Wyandottes also have a pottery tradition?  Smith Yeah.  Little Thunder Have you explored that?  Smith Oh, yeah, and this is important because when I started I had no idea. I had  no idea what the Wyandotte pottery, what it looked like back in the 1600s,  1500s. I really didn   t even have much of a connection to that history. All I  knew was they came from Ohio. In Ohio everybody was using copper and  brass kettles. They just weren   t making pottery. I think I probably told  people,    Wyandottes didn   t have a pottery tradition,    but they did at one  time. Up in Ontario, the homelands   when we think of the homelands, we  think of Ontario all the way up to the Georgian Bay. The Wyandotte, what  they call Huron, those are my ancestors. The pottery method and techniques  there   what is interesting about this to me, that the Pueblo and the  longhouse people are so close in a lot of ways, even though they   re a whole  different kind of a living area and everything.  They   re founded on villages, village life, matriarchal systems, the seasons  are so important because of planting corn and bean and squash, those things  that are so important for life sustaining, what we call life-sustainers. There   s  a cyclical thing of seasonal ceremonies. There   s the village life, all this stuff.  A lot of that was lost once they left the homelands. They were forced out of  the homelands, and ended up down in Michigan and in Ohio and then  eventually, of course, Kansas. I started studying that. Once I started finding  out what the pottery tradition was, I started looking into that. I started doing  some more reproductions. Did a few of those. Once I got the feel for it,     Okay, I   m going to start doing my corrugated.    I started corrugating some  20  of my old Wyandotte designs and shapes, so it   s a combination now. It   s  like I   m combining Southwest and Northeast.  Little Thunder Because they did a lot of incising of designs?  Smith Yes, a lot of incising. Occasionally you   ll see a place   looking at sherds,  you   ll see where they put on little coils and they   d smooth them and that, but  there were more added. It was additives and not actually building with these  tiny coils. I   ve been mixing these things, and it   s kind of coming up with its  own hybrid, which is fun. It   s really fun.  Little Thunder When and why did you decide to move to Wyandotte?  Smith I had started back in early   80s writing to Wyandotte Nation to see what  language was available, what   s there. They   d send me a list of words.     Here   s a few words,    twenty words, twenty sentences. To me, it was like a  treasure. I met this historian, Charles Aubrey Buser, who was an elder at that  time, an older guy, white guy, but somehow he got into Wyandotte stuff. He  lives out in Maryland at the time. He really got into it. There   s always  somebody out there, and he did. He was studying up on it. He was going to  museums. He was investigating. I met him, started talking to him, and he  started sending me some recordings, Wyandotte recordings that were done  in 1911. That just blew me away because it was like touching the ancestors.  It was like having them reach you with a voice coming through.  You   re listening to these voices, people that were born in Ohio as free  Wyandotte people that were not forced in Ohio. They chose to live in Ohio.  That   s where they were born, and they   re singing their songs. They   re  singing those traditional songs. That   s what really started sparking it. We  were living in Navajo land. Yeah, I was picking up Navajo, just enough to  make me dangerous, (Laughter) make people think I knew Navajo but I  don   t know that much. I was like,    Whoa, what about my own language?  What about my own stuff?    So I started really investigating that, and that   s  where I started uncovering some of these things. I started writing to the  tribe, a lot of letters back and forth. Then I started making trips out here and  did a pottery class or two.  I thought,    Wow, there seems to be some interest.    There wasn   t as much  interest as I thought there would be, but what it did do is it brought me in  contact with some of the people who are traditionalists in this area. When I  brought in   I volunteered.    I   m going to be here two weeks. We   re going to  do clay, and we   re going to do pottery in the old Wyandotte techniques.    I  wasn   t going to teach the corrugated; that   s Southwest stuff. Pueblo people  should be teaching that, not me. I felt like I   m going to teach our own stuff.  We had Seneca-Cayugas there. We had Quapaw. We   ve had a couple of  Wyandottes show up. (Laughs) We had some Cherokee, of course. Anna  21  Belle and Victoria  Mitchells , they came. Victoria helped me out with one.  We did a workshop together which was fun. That was a lot of fun. That was  hilarious.  She   s a crackup, you know. We had a good time together, and we just  started thinking,    Maybe, because I   m working with language, I   m making  prayers   .    By that time I had a lot of language material, and I was taking  sentences and words out of narratives that were Wyandotte phrases.    Oh, I  can use that in the sweat lodge. I can use that right there.    I   d start saying  that word or that sentence over and over. It had all the inflections, and it had  all the little nasal marks. You knew, as close as you could know, how it was  to be sounded out, and I   d start saying those. As I started saying them,  they   d start singing. The songs started coming, some songs. I still have a lot  of those that are sweat songs. We use them in sweat lodge here, even.  Little Thunder You have a sweat lodge?  Smith Yeah, yeah. There was a lot of prayer that went into this, just about being  open. I fasted and fasted, and I   d sweat, and I had visions, powerful visions  and dreams that were just amazing. I haven   t had anything like that in a long  time, but they were all telling me about the roots and about listening to the  water, being like the salmon going up the current, staying in the midstream,  staying against the current, fighting those currents, not ducking behind the  boulders and resting too long. You have to keep this up. It   s a continual  struggle. Recently I was able to get a tattoo done on my arm. Some of it was  done   right here with needles. Then others were done down in New  Zealand, Aotearoa. The Maori did it, tapped it in, which was really great  because these guys do spiritual stuff all the time. It   s like,    Okay, we can do  this. You tell me your story. I   ll put it on your skin.     Anyway, these things started happening, and I started feeling that   . There  was a group of people that started to get interested in our culture, not just  about understanding it as a museum, an interest, but,    Let   s wake it up   Let   s get it going again. Let   s see if we can revive these things.    We   re  doing that. We   re doing that now. One of the ways I started with language, I  had adult classes. I   ve had adult classes here at the fitness center. That was  great. I got to meet a lot of people that I hadn   t really known. Then started  working with the school, the Wyandotte public school. I went over. My wife  and I   d go over and bring puppets. For seven years we   d show up every  Tuesday or every Thursday, whichever day was right for everybody, and all  day we   d be there with these kids. When you have these huge classrooms of  kids all sitting there, the entire third grade, the entire sixth   we didn   t do  sixth grade.  Fifth grade was as high as we went. You had to do something where you can  keep them all, so I started writing songs for kids. I didn   t want to put them in  22  European nursery rhymes.    We can come up with our own tunes. We have  great music; we got our own songs.    So, again, what I did, I   d make these  phrases, and I   d start singing them, just the phrases. They loved it. The kids  loved it. I   d make them work first. We   d sing. We   d take one of the songs  apart, adjust it, say,    Okay, let   s change that part of the song. Let   s talk  about this now   .    They would do that and do that and then say,    When   s  the story coming?    For the last part, I thought,    Okay, it   s wintertime. You  haven   t seen any snakes have you?       No, haven   t seen any snakes.       Okay,  let   s tell these   . Where were we last week?    They   d tell me, and then I   d  go on because we have some of these stories that just go on and on, fox and  coon stories that go back and forth, back and forth.  You can keep them going for a long time. Of course, once the snakes start  coming out, they   ll let you know. The kids   ll,    We saw a snake     Then all  the other kids are like,    No  Shh  Don   t tell him     I said,    That   s okay. I   ve  got some of my own stories that we can tell.    (Laughter) They   re not those  stories, but that   s akin. We   d already moved here. I didn   t really tell you  how we got here, but it kind of slowly happened. We were doing the pottery  workshops, and then we just put our name into a machine at a realtor and  said,    If forty acres show up somewhere, doesn   t matter if there   s anything  on it or not, let us know.    They put us on an automatic mailer, and this place  showed up. It had only been on the market for two or three days. We saw the  stone house. Right away it was like,    Oh, that looks our house in Ganado,     our stone house.  It   s like,    Zhoop,    drew me in. I said,    Let   s go check it out.    It was about  May. It was in May. It was a beautiful time to come check it out. The house  was a mess. It was a mess. Oh, the termites had really worked on it. My wife  was like,    Uh.    All she could see was the house, and I   m looking at the  property. (Laughter) When they took us down to the spring down there  across the creek, went down to the spring, and I went up on top, up on top of  the bluff up here. I came back down the spring along those bluffs, those  limestone bluffs, it   s like,    This is it. This is it, Carol. This is it.    She was  not convinced. It took a long, long time. It probably took her two or three  years. (Laughter)  Little Thunder We   re going to talk about your process and techniques a little more, but  before we do, a question about how you came to be involved in that trip to  New Zealand and how you got involved with Maori, culturally.  Smith Yeah, that was incredible. You want to talk about that now?  Little Thunder Yeah, how did that happen?  Smith It   s one of these connection things. It was wonderful. Al Qoyawayma was a  Hopi potter. He   s been going down to New Zealand. He   s been invited down  23  for years. He goes down, went regularly. Well, his wife was pretty ill. He  just couldn   t make it one year, so he called me up. He goes,    Would you be  interested in a trip to New Zealand?    I said,    Tell me about it.    He said,     You   d be working with Maori people for as long as you want to stay down  there, I guess. We   re going to have a show down in   .    Can   t think of the  town right now, North Island? I hate it when that happens, I can   t remember  things. It   ll come. He says,    Are you interested? If you are, I   ll let you start  talking with some of the Maori people who are setting this up. It   s going to  be a Maori market.    It   s like they do in Santa Fe; it   s a Maori market, no  competitions. He didn   t tell me   I didn   t know anything about that.  I said,    Yeah, that sounds great     There   s a group of potters down there.  They call themselves muddies, and they have their own organization like  your 501 (c)  status. They can apply for grants. They have their dues and  whatnot. They   d bring an artist down for a while. I got to go  I was chosen  that way through Al. Al let me know about it, and if it hadn   t been for him,  it would   ve never happened. We hit it off. I was down there for three weeks.  I   ll tell you what, it   s so amazing. When you   re down there and you   re  among the Maori people and they   re telling you the history of their island, I  was just amazed because we   d be driving along, and they   d say,    See that  mountain there? There was a battle that happened there. This chief, he did  this, and he went over to the edge, and he fell off there   .    It   s like the  whole island, the stories are everywhere on that island.  When you see the women with their chins tattooed, traditionally those are  the ones that can recite their ancestry back to their first arrivals eight  hundred years ago. Then got to visit some immersion schools. Oh, my gosh,  that was incredible. I brought my puppets, too, so it was neat. I got to tell a  story. Of course, I had to do it in English. They allowed for that because I  was a visiting artist, but I got to tell Wyandotte stories down there at  immersion school. The little guys, the little kids, they met you outside, and  they did their haka. There was a little guy there, bare-chested guy, little  kindergartener out there. (Imitates haka grunting sounds) It was so cool   Brought in. They would sing the welcoming song and be welcomed in. It  was a wonderful experience. I made connections down there that are still  there. Last year I was there again. Last year I went with a group of all  indigenous people from all over.  We had a lot of islanders. There were Samoans and Hawaiian and some  from Australia, aborigine from there. There were Northwest Coast carvers.  There were some Iroquoian people, which was great because we all sang  similar songs and we could do things together, do an adowa or something,  sing those things together. It was for two weeks and working together under  a big tent, artists working together for two weeks, and with food that was  incredible  A big cafeteria right at a marae. You   re in a tribal area. The  people are taking care of you, and they welcomed us in. They gave us the  24  formal ceremony. We brought in a canoe and actually walked this waka, big  waka. We walked it up onto the marae, singing. We had people singing with  us, doing the welcoming, the responses, in the marae itself. They were  singing there outside of their building and singing those chants and  welcoming us so it came together. When we went inside there   s a special     they stand in line, and you go past them, and you touch their heads   .  Once you   re there, you   re a part of it. You   re a part of them now. It   s  wonderful. It was wonderful. There   s a whole group of clay people,  woodcarvers, painters, printmakers, jewelers. Denise Wallace was there with  her jewelry. It was amazing. It was just so amazing. Everybody   s on fire  because they   re all interested in the same thing. It   s all about retaining  culture and trying to bring back, awaken it. Whatever   s sleeping, try to wake  it up, reclaim it, and allow it to infuse your work. Let it come in, not like  you   re forcing it but just let it come in. Yeah, when you   re around a bunch  of Maori, then you get an airplane full of pakeha, the white people, all of a  sudden it   s like the temperature in the room kind of goes,    Whoosh.    Gets  cold, being around all that warmth. (Laughter). Mana, they call it mana, all  that wonderful Maori mana.  Little Thunder Sounds wonderful. Talking about your process and techniques a bit more,  you worked with hand-dug clay? Is that right? Is that what you work with?  Smith Yeah.  Little Thunder Do you get it all from here, or are you getting it from other sources, as well?  Smith Near the Vinita area. I won   t go into specifics, but basically anything under  Vinita all the way up to the Kansas border. All you got to do is dig down  there, and you hit this yellowish, greenish, grayish clay, and there it is. It   s  just everywhere. Wherever there   s shale, that   s a good place to look. Where  people are digging ponds, you   ll notice a sort of yellowish kind of color.  That   s that clay. I   ll tell you, it is the best clay I have ever worked. It   s better  than anything.  Little Thunder And, again, you don   t have to add, really, too much to it.  Smith I do add some temper to it, yeah. I add crushed flint to it. You don   t have to.  Anna Belle never really added anything to hers. She didn   t work really big,  Anna Belle Mitchell. I don   t think she added anything at all. You can get  away with it, but I like it just because it keeps the shrinkage down a little bit  to add something. But it   s so nice. It takes a lot of different temperatures.  The Arizona clay is very temperamental. Boy, you could build really thin  and tall, but they were temperamental. They had gypsum crystals in them.  That gypsum, once it   s fired it turns to plaster. If it swells in the humidity,  it   ll make these little pits, so you know where the Arizona clay is. You see  25  my pots in the old times, and you see the little white specks. It   s the little  markers. That   s this Arizona clay.  Little Thunder You use clay slips, but you also have other techniques for creating color.  Smith Yeah, I use Mason stains to mix with the clays. Basically the most simple  thing I do is if I get a Mason stain and a clay slip, they all go through a 200-  mesh screen so that I can brush them on. There won   t be any grittiness at all,  but I start everything with half and half. I like that: half and half. Half stain  and half slip. Let   s say, to make a green or something like that, I   ll use a  forest green Mason stain, which is basically a bunch of minerals that are all  ground together, and then very fine clay, half of that dry form, and mix them  together. Now, if I want those shades to go to black, then I   ll make a black,  and I do all the shades in between. I   ll have the green going all the way to  black by changing. I use a gram scale for that. I may have eight different  shades in between, and that   ll give me   . If I run out of one, I know exactly  how to replace that.  Little Thunder You just get the most amazing, as they say, trompe l'oeil effects from  combining form and texturing. I   m wondering when you see a form, do you  already know how you want to texture it, when you   re thinking about a form,  or do you discover that as you work? Do they come together, form and  texture?  Smith Of course, a lot of the texturing is done by the coil itself. By leaving those  little coils showing, you get that. All the horizontal lines are kind of put in  just by the coils overlapping. If I   m going to use textures, then I, of course,  have to get to the clay while it   s still damp. When I put a design in, in  Arizona and New Mexico, I had to allow the   the design had to grow with  the pot because it   s so dry there. It just would dry. The piece could be dry all  the way there, and it   s still wet on top for a pot that size. Here, this has been  great because actually the humidity really works in the favor in the clay  because I can actually create a whole piece and then go back and put the  design in. It   s still damp enough. It   s firm enough that it holds itself, but it  still has enough dampness that, with tools, you can indent it and scratch  lines and put a pattern in.  Little Thunder Looking at some of your pots, you know, you think about, like, a shell or  feathers or a corn husk or a gourd. Are you striving to evoke associations  with other natural objects in your pots, or is that just something that  happens accidently in a way?  Smith I may happen kind of accidently, also, the fact that I do a lot of work with  wood. I work with wood. I work with leather. Surface will sometimes be  similar in whatever I do and there   s a   . If there   s something that pleases  me, it   s something that I get the same result from leather or wood, so that  26  could be. I think it   s not so much like I   m imitating another material. Maybe  it   s the aesthetic. I guess it   s just an aesthetic that I   m drawn to. Like, very  glossy surfaces I don   t do that often because, to me, it doesn   t work with my  pieces as well. I do like them smooth. I like things that have a little bit of a  shine to them. Sometimes I   ll be brushing, brushing it with a brush to get a  little bit of a sheen so that when it   s fired, there   s something that catches the  light, but then some surfaces will be totally matte. Then maybe the rim will  have a little bit of a sheen to it, but more like a leather, a shiny leather.  Maybe it is. Maybe it   s more of an aesthetic thing.  Little Thunder Speaking of the wood, you   ve made some very polished-looking stands for  your pottery or pottery as plates, but then you   ve also been experimenting  with driftwood pieces as holders.  Smith Yeah, some pieces seem to almost want something more sterile, something  that doesn   t draw itself attention whereas other pieces are very organic.  They look like something that   s kind of coming up out of the ground in the  springtime, something you   d find out there among the May apples, kind of  coming up through the leaves. It does seem like roots. I walk the creeks.  This is a great time of year to go hike the creeks, especially Sycamore  Creek. The cottonmouths are still a little slow. You can see them on the  bank sometimes, but it   s warm now. You don   t want to be in the water when  they start getting a little more feisty. I   ve been out there wearing waders. I  walk down the creeks and the thing is, I like the same places the  cottonmouths like, too, because they like those root balls that are hanging  there on the edges. They like to get up there. It   s kind of like fighting for a  root. Sometimes I   ll see a certain root, and it   s like,    Okay, I   m going to  have to come later on that one. There   s a guy on that one.    Boy, those things  are ugly, those big ol   heads on them.  There   s something about roots. I think it has a lot to do with all the stuff, this  cultural stuff, because it   s underground. Now it   s exposed. The creek, when  it floods here   and it hasn   t flooded in a couple years, but when it does, the  creek changes. It   s like going through a new creek, and it   s really neat. I  love going through a new creek. Our old creek down here will all of a  sudden become new, new rocks, new stuff, atlatl points if you   re lucky, or  some flaking tools, and things that just show up. But the roots, they   re  exposed, and then you get to see what   s going on underneath, things that are  wrapped around rocks and stones. I love it when roots go apart and then they  come back together again. They make these   it   s like where is the sap  flowing? It looks like it   s going to go around and around. (Laughter) So,  yeah, those are pieces that I like to integrate into my work, handles or   .  Another inspiration for me for those things have been the whole discipline  of basket making, like Japanese basketry which is a whole art in itself. The  masters, these guys have done these for generations, and the skill level is  27  just unbelievable. They   re splitting their cane and everything to the finest  degree. I respect that. I really respect that craftsmanship when I see that. I  probably end up having more respect for craftsmen in that intense follow-through  and developing of skills than I do when I think of just modern art. I  connect more with it, not to say that one   s more valid than the other, but I  connect more with the craftsmen and the craft and the skill level. When I  was down in New Zealand, too, that   s the same thing. When I was with the  Maori, watching the weavers, watching them work that flax.    Oh, I got to do  that  I got to try that. Can I take some of that? I want to try that. How do you  split those? Let me see that  Can I try?    I had to do it. I had to get in there.  Just hanging out with the ladies, the women, hanging out with these old  ladies was just a treat. I love it.  Little Thunder In terms of your incised designs, those take a lot of drafting skills. I   m  wondering do you spend much time drawing, or do you sketch your designs  beforehand?  Smith I do like to do a little rough sketch to get started. I don   t put everything  down that I   ll do on the plate. Otherwise, it   s   . It   s kind of like making a  decal or something. When I have a big plate that I   m working on and I   m  going to do an etching or something on it, it   s a challenge. The hardest part  is starting because you have this huge surface and you have an idea of how  you want it to be but you have to start. You can draw very lightly with a  charcoal, but you don   t want to push too deeply because if you do, you  disturb the surface that you   ve slipped. It   s like you   re drawing   feathery  thing, then you have to dig in and start scratching it off. I like it. I like the  kind of control I   ve got when I started doing that scratching into the black  slip and scratching it away. It   s almost like doing a block cut or something.  Yeah, it   s almost like that.  Little Thunder What is your creative process, beginning with how you get your ideas?  (Laughter)  Smith That   s a good one. I think a couple of things. First of all, Carol will come up  and say,    We need a pot.    (Laughter) I   m like,    Okay, yeah, I   ve been  working in the garden a little too much here. I got too much going over  there. It   s time to make a pot.    So I go in there, and I say,    What am I going  to do? All right, there was a pot I was working on, and I took it this  direction, but I   d like to try something else with it. I   d like to try taking it in  a different direction.    It   s like working on a tree. When I do a show, I want  to have something in the show that represents all the branches. It   s like all  these branches. People don   t know that, so it looks like,    Boy, he   s jumping  from this to that.    All these branches are growing and evolving over time,  but at a show it   ll be one of those, and one of those, and one of those, and  one of those. Of course, sometimes a new branch, which is some of the  28  etching stuff which I   ve been doing, a new branch is growing here, and  that   ll be something new for the show.  There   s a lot of evolving going on. Nothing just happens. When I first  started, I was looking only at the old stuff. I was doing the reproduction,  almost like a reproduction of an ancient pot, but I couldn   t do that for very  long. I started to say,    I   m going to put a little color in here.    At first it was  like,    Okay a little bit of iron oxide, mix it with a little clay, fill that part  in   .    Then it was like,    Maybe I can put two colors in.    Then I started  adding a little more. Next thing, I   m three, and then it   s infinite now. It   s  like they could go forever. It was real important for me to start from the  root, the root of the ancient ones. The same with the Wyandotte stuff. Now  when I   m working with the Shawnee, we   re doing that, too. We   re going  back to that ancient roots first. Get your feel back to where the ancestors  were when they were first making these pieces, before those trade kettles  came along and everybody said,    I   m not doing this anymore  Get me a  brass trade kettle      Little Thunder And you just mentioned because you   re working with the Shawnee tribe on a  pottery workshop or something?  Smith Yeah, yeah. It   s kind of in the birthing process. It   s still very young, but it   s  exciting. People are real excited about it, too.  Little Thunder What is your creative routine? It might be that you don   t have a rigid one,  but what is the routine of creativity?  Smith I wake up in the morning, usually take a walk, walk through the woods. If  it   s summer, I do have to stick closer to the paths because of all the ticks in  the woods. I have to say,    Okay, the woods are alone until the cool weather  comes back.    Part of it starts that way, starts with that morning, listening to  all the sounds around, watching the plants, looking for things I hadn   t  noticed before. I found a sugar maple on our property. I didn   t know there  was a sugar maple here, and I   ve been here ten years. I   ve occasionally  found these little tiny maples, but there   s a sugar maple here. The other year  I found a pear tree. I mean, big pears, not the little Bradford pear. I   m kind  of doing that, too. We have all this property here, and it   s like an exploration  and taking care of it. I spend a couple hours in the morning taking care of it.  There   s a bunch of little trees that are started on the top forty on the eastern  side. It   s all from a field that   s overgrown, and I   m happy about that.  There   s no reason it should   ve been cleared. It was all trees and nice in  there, so all those trees are coming back. Now I can actually walk under  them, which I couldn   t do when we first moved here. It was just a tangled  mess, wild hogs up there bedding down and everything, but now you can  actually walk under those trees. All winter I go up there with a saw. That   s  29  part of my morning routine. I have a little handsaw in the back of my  pocket, trimming up things and deciding if I keep that grapevine or take that  one down.    No, that one   s killing the trees. I   m going to take that one.     Then when I come in, another cup of coffee, and I   m out to the studio   or  maybe on Facebook a little bit. (Laughter)  Little Thunder So you do use social media a little bit to help?  Smith Yeah, that   s really   I don   t have a big social life, you know. (Laughter) I   m  deprived. I deprive myself intentionally a lot. When we do get together, it   s  usually we   re having a social dance or something where it   s,    Okay, I   ve got  to do this. This is important.     Little Thunder What was a fork-in-the-road moment for you when you could   ve gone one  way but you chose to go another?  Smith Wow, that   s a big question. In artwork or   . Well, I can see the fork being  partly where I was working on the potter   s wheel a lot, and all of a sudden I  started hand-building with native clays. I thought,    This is nice. I can do  this,    whereas before, I   . When you   re in school, you   re young, you   re  arrogant, you want to be the bigshot. You want to be the guy who   s,    I   m  better than those guys. I   m better than those seniors. I   m a junior, and I   m  better than them.    You may not actually say that, but you think that stuff.     I   m not going to do something I   m not good at. I don   t want to do hand-building.     In a way, that chance to be away from all that scene, that  academic thing, and the whole ceramic studio, and you   re alone, all you   ve  got are kids to teach, and you got pottery sherds out there in the desert to  look at, and you   ve got kids that are interested in learning, and no tools, fifty  dollars for the year for your supplies, that changed a lot of things. That set  me on a whole different course. For firing, it   s,    What do I do?    I look  around.    Well, we got some cinderblock. I could pile them up here, put dirt  in them.    You start improvising. I think that was a big turning point there.  Little Thunder What was one of the high points? You might   ve mentioned it before, but  what would be one you haven   t thought of yet?  Smith In the artwork, art world? There   s a particular piece that I finished just  recently that was a high point. It was almost at that point where I almost got  very close to saying,    I did it. I   m done. I can go now. I   m happy. I think  I   ve reached   this is what I wanted to do. Now if I do anymore, I   m just  going to be reproducing that one or I   m going to be doing more of those. I  feel like I   ve got everything in there. I   ve got my ancestry. I   ve got my own  originality in there, embedded. I   ve got a sense of floral designs against a  black buckskin, but it   s that design that   s on there, the elements. Each panel  has its own. Every flower represents that tree that   s in the sky world where  every flower was different.    That   s where you see that, in a lot of Iroquoian  30  work. All the flowers are different. It   s like,    I think I   ve done it  What do  you do now?     It was a good feeling, but it was also,    I don   t know if I can beat that. I don   t  know     You   ll see pictures of that one, one of those. Felt pretty good about  that. I think also, I think a lot. I   m sixty. I   ll be turning sixty this year, so I  think a lot about what I   m leaving behind. It   s not a morbid thing. It   s just  you can only be here so long and then you got to move over and let other  people have a chance. I started thinking a lot more seriously about,    What  are you going to spend your time doing?    I want to be able to   I   m a  speaker in our longhouse. I   m going to learn those speeches really well. I  want to be able to say them fluidly, but I also want to give them   I don   t  want to just blah, blah, blah, blah, like a Latin prayer or something. I want to  give it some real character when I speak. I want those sounds to be perfect.  Those things are important.  I   m still learning Wyandotte songs. There   s still some songs I don   t know  yet. I have to transcribe them. I listen to those old cylinders. I put on the  headphones and really listen so carefully. On the computer, I put a Word  document up, and I   ll write what I think I hear. Then I   ll play it back again.     That   s not that. That   s this,    and so I change it. Go over and over and over.  When you first hear a song, it   s kind of like nonsense. Then you find the  pattern in there.    Oh, there   s a pattern. Here   s the pattern. Okay, I got it. Got  it. Now I need to learn to sing it.    I   ve been doing that with songs, some of  our songs. There   s a Wyandotte woman   s dance that we start, even before  our ceremonies start. The person  Smith Nichols  in 1911 who sang this one  for Marius Barbeau said,    This is a really old song. This is the oldest song I  know.     In 1911, he   s an old guy. He   s in his eighties, and he says,    This is a really  old song.    This is what we start. It   s a woman   s dance song. We get the  women who are all the helpers to dance this one, and the men sing this one  for the women, and they dance that grounds with their feet. It   s like  spreading the earth on the back of that turtle. We   re representing that. The  Earth is being made right there. The women are spreading their feet just like  Sky Woman when she came down and danced that earth around on the back  of the turtle. Now we   re ready for ceremony. The women have done their  thing, and now we   re ready. Things like that are important to me. I want to  get it right. I   m still actually even adding songs to those. I   ll find another  woman dance song. Those are things that are important. My time, I think  about my time.  I   d like to be able to offer classes to people, but I also think   I don   t like to  sound like I   m snobby about it, but I have to really concentrate on traditional  people who are traditional people who really want to revive traditions at this  point. I don   t like to cut off a class and say,    No white people allowed.    I  31  don   t like to say that, but at the same time I think,    Yeah, but my goal is to  see some of these old traditions come back.    Again, it   s not just to make  reproductions, but it   s to get them moving. Just like our language, once it  wakes up again, we   ve got to come up with new words. We don   t have a  word for camera or microphone or these things. There   s just so much to do,  but I think about that. I think about how I spend my time.  Little Thunder What   s been one of the low points?  Smith Oh, low points has been being misunderstood, I think, yeah, being  misunderstood, people thinking,    Who   s this new guy here? He   s come  here, and he wants to show us how to be Indian or something. We   ve grown  up here all our life. We know what we   re doing.    We have some problems.  There are some problems with the community here because some people  don   t quite understand. There   s some suspicion against some of our  ceremonial things, too. Because of the way some of the people have been  raised, there   s been a fear of some of the traditional things.  Little Thunder Is this a church / traditional religion split?  Smith Yeah, we   ve seen that quite a bit. Some of the tribal members here are very  involved in their particular brands of Christianity, which make those things  suspect and very likely on the dark side. It   s very difficult to work with  people like that because as soon as they   re convinced of that or they   re even  suspicious of that, when you suggest them or even when you want to sing  songs, it   s kind of like,    Oh, you   re working for the other side,    or,    You   re  on the dark side.    There   s that feeling sometimes I get that people don   t  understand that these came up from the ground here. These are our ancient  roots. These are just as real to us as the blood in our veins. There   s nothing  spooky about these songs. These are our traditional ways. There   s a  ceremony. We have the Wyandotte words for this person talking about these  ceremonies. He mentions something about when the people feast together  and when they dance together, the peace will come back. Peace will return.  I think about that. I think people are missing out because they tend to think  of this as a competition, almost like competition, again. It   s like I   m  competing maybe. Yeah, it   s been very discouraging at times, but I also  understand that   s just the way it is. It   s just the way it is. If it   s important  enough, you have to keep going. You have to keep at it, and hopefully  people will realize you   re not out there to try to, you   re not there to scold.  You   re just trying to help. You   re trying to help. I think in some ways  maybe I do feel like I   ve been given some kind of insight, like I see things in  a different way, and maybe that bothers people that they think,    Well, you  just think you do.    (Laughs) I don   t know, but because of the passion for  language   . When you start using the language, when you start using the  language, it starts to become a part of you.  32  You realize what you   ve lost because you   re using a language that   s not at  all like English. It   s not the same thinking process. You   re beginning to use  the same patterns that your ancestors used. It   s like making, for the first  time, starting a fire with a bow drill. These are ancient. These are so ancient,  making your own arrows and bows by hand, but you   re connecting by that.  There   s some kind of connection that happens when you pull back your own  bow that you cut on your property; and the string on it is from a dogbane  that grew up on the side of the hill; and you   re shooting an arrow made from  hazel that grows right there on the bluff; and the turkey feathers you found  down there; and the point that you chipped out of a piece of flint down there.  This bow might not have ever left the property. Its whole life is right here.  Maybe the turkeys left. (Laughter) There   s something about that. I feel a  connection. There   s something there. There   s a connection, nothing  necessarily magical or mystical about it. It   s just there   s something very  rooted about that. Roots, again.  Little Thunder We   re going to pause a minute and take a look at your artwork.  Smith All right. Even though this may not be one of the most beautiful, artistic  accomplishments of myself, I thought it was important because this drum,  (we say in Wyandotte, yad  hkwa) it   s the heartbeat of our people. A water  drum like this is our traditional, the drum we use for our ceremonies and for  social dances. Now, this one   s made of clay. A lot of the traditional drums  that came from Ohio are made out of little kegs. Here they began using them  out of crocks, little crocks. It   s like whatever, as long as you can tie it down  and make a sound. When I first came down and I noticed people at the  Seneca-Cayuga longhouse using a little crock, I thought,    I can make a  crock.    (Laughter) Not only that, for me, I can put sand in it from the  homelands. I can mix in very special sand and earth from places that are  really, really, special to me.  33  I did that, and I made a drum, tied it down. These are stones that I found,  special round stones that I use. There   s six. We use six, not seven like a  peyote drum. It   s kind of like the turtle. It also represents the seasonal  directions. Also, the skin, the deer skin, this is one I tanned, smoke-tanned  buckskin. We never used a big drum. This was the only kind of drum we  ever had. One of the songs, I could do a little song here to give you a little  sample here. One of the things we had a lot were   we did a moccasin game.  Moccasin game was something we used a lot, just for fun. Sometimes it   s  taken pretty seriously. (Laughter) Some people got really into the gaming  back then, betted a lot. These are old songs that came from recordings from  1911 and   12. (Drums and sings) Here   s another one: Moccasin Game Song.  (Drums and sings) Just to give you a little sample.  Little Thunder Thank you  It   s wonderful.  Smith This piece is an old Wyandotte story. Also, Iroquoians share it, too, about  the woman who fell from the sky. There   s versions of it, different versions  of what happened, why she ended up falling from the sky. In our tradition,  she fell from the sky, and she was caught by two either swans or geese. It   s  the same word in Wyandotte. It   s yahounk.  Little Thunder Yahounk. It sounds like the noise.  Smith Yeah, so the yahounk caught her on the back. They talked. They saw her  falling, and they rushed to catch her. This is where she   s falling, and she   s  landing on the back of these geese here or ducks, or goose, geese, yahounk.  The yahounk are catching her, and she   s pregnant, and she   s going to give  34  birth. You can see on her face that she   s not too worried. She   s a little  uncertain, but she   s not really afraid. She knows things are meant to be the  way they are. When she   s caught there, of course, the animals have to get  together and decide what are they going to do with her because they   ve  never had a person before. All they have are water animals around. There   s  nothing around to really put her on, so the Great Turtle,  ham  r  re gt;hangya gt;wi  , he comes, surfaces, and when he comes to the top of  the water, (speaks Wyandotte)   . It goes on and on. He comes up out of the  water, and the water   s streaming off his back.  He says,    She can live on top of me, or you can put her on me.    The geese  put her on the back of ham  r  re gt;hangya gt;wi  , the Great Moss-Back Turtle.  You can see and think about the water coming off the back as little rivers  and little streams and creeks, and the moss becoming the plants. Now, we   re  a little different than the Cayuga. The Cayuga say the animals   well, this is  where we all share the story. The animals noticed that when she fell, a tree  came down, too, fell down through the sky. They noticed that some of that  earth fell down through that hole. They thought,    That must be part of her  homeland. We need that.    It was all water. There was nothing, just water, so  the animals all said,    Who can go down and get some of that earth?     Different animals try, of course, and eventually   . Well, you kind of go  through each animal, and they all have a tragic end.  We   re really not supposed to go into a lot of details about the story in this  season since it   s springtime and the snakes are coming out. Basically the  toad is the one in our story, ket  skwa gt;y  h comes up. She dies, but she has a  little mouthful of mud. Because she sacrificed her life, she went right up to  the Turtle, and Sky Woman took that earth and started to spread it on the  back. Then she danced. That first song that was ever heard on the world  below was a woman   s dance song, so she danced that. It   s called a Shuffle  Dance. It   s where the women   s feet don   t really leave the ground. They do  the shuffle as they go around. She   s spreading that earth, and when she  started to spread it, that earth began to grow. Her voice would carry, and that  earth would go on and on because of the sacrifice. It   s kind of about that  story, but this part is the first part where she   s falling. Now I got to think  about the next plate. (Laughter) What   s going to come next?  Little Thunder What   s going to come next. That   s wonderful.  Smith But it   s a challenge for me because I   ve really not done a lot of this drawing  and stuff in a long time.  Little Thunder There   s a lot of wonderful drawing and draftsmanship in that.  Smith Yeah, it was a real   I just love doing it. Something that was so, boy, it felt  so good to do. I have to do more of them now, I know.  35  Little Thunder Right, they   re calling to you.  Smith Yeah. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Thank you very much for your time today, Richard.  Smith Oh, sure, sure, yeah. You bet. I   ve enjoyed it.  -------  -------
