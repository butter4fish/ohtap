 Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, July 18, 2009 and we   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma at the Stillwater Public Library interviewing Conlee Jewett.   Her daughter Mary is joining us.  This interview is being conducted as  part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma: Life in the 1930s oral history  project. Thank you so much for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. If you could tell us  where you grew up and give us a little background into your early life.  Well, to begin with, I was born in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, which I consider  Tulsa   s backdoor. I lived there a very long time, did I not? And then,  what Mary?  You lived there through your elementary school years, in Sapulpa.  Right.  And then moved to Stillwater in high school, junior high.  And then I went to high school there and then I attended Oklahoma State  University with a degree in Foods and Nutrition. That   s the nice title.  What it amounts to is I   m a good cook.  (Laughs) Well that   s not too bad.  So, you know, that   s how that plays out. You can give it all kinds of     what   s the woman who used to be on television, a very strong accent?  Julia Child. I   m seventy-nine so I   m a take-off on Julia Child, is the best  way I can describe it. I like food; it doesn   t scare me. I like to peel, cut,  5  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  whatever you do to produce a wonderful product. Having said that, I like  best of all to have forty to seventy people in my house for supper.  That   s a lot of prep.  It is, but it didn   t seem so. I was a Foods and Nutrition major at  Oklahoma State University. For me, that was a given. And most friends  you make, the new people you meet, have one common thing among  all   gender has nothing to do with it, everybody is hungry when it   s  time to eat. So I always found that a challenge and a lot of fun to  prepare. I   d rather prepare for twenty-five people than for twelve. We  might not all have the same thing after twenty-five people, but no one  ever went home hungry. They thought they   d had a grand buffet when it  was probably going to be leftovers that I had in the refrigerator because I  hadn   t planned to have that many people. My husband was a college  professor. He would call me at four and say,    You know what, old Jim is  here from the University of Missouri. I   ve asked him and the members  of the department for supper. I hope it   s all right.    I would say,    Just  fine. Is it all right if we don   t all have the same thing?    Because it   s  impossible if you   re going to dine at six and they call at four to put it all  together.  I had a woman of color who helped me out and she would say,    Dr.  Jewett, he ain   t got a lick of sense.    (Laughter)    He waits and calls us at  four o   clock in the afternoon and says he   s bringing all these people.     And I   d say,    Don   t worry about that. What do we have in the freezer in  case we run out of what we had planned or what can we make quickly?  Not all day, it can   t take all day to cook. What can we cook within forty  minutes so when they get here we have  it ready ? I   ll take care of the  dining room service. I   ll get that taken care of if you will gather all of  the food we have and then you and I will take care of a wide service tray  as a buffet and we will slice the bread, we will put that Cuba butter  quickly in the microwave so it   s soft, not melted. And then we   ll act like  it   s all in a day   s work. And for dessert, since I had no time, we will  have delicious ice cream, any kind of topping you want.    I always had  strawberry preserves. I   m a cook, so in strawberry season I would put up  strawberry preserves. Peach preserves when peaches were in season. If  we had fresh fruit, if it was summertime and the time was right, you had  watermelon, cantaloupe stuffed with vanilla ice cream. So those are all  easily taken care of within a two-hour period of time.  Now, because my husband did all of this, he had to participate and make  a contribution some way so he would say,    Now, you know I   m bringing  all these people. I hope you don   t mind.    And I said,    I don   t mind if  you don   t mind going by the grocery store. I   ve already talked to Mr.  Fowler, he will have what I ask IGA to do. Don   t say anything to him.  6  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Just say    How much is my bill?    Pay it, come home now. Don   t decide  that you   re going to have a bottle of wine, we can do without it. They  didn   t come to drink. They came to eat and to dine.     How did you learn how to cook?  I was a Foods and Nutrition major in college. I always liked it. I did well  with it. My downfall, I   m a chemistry minor and I hated it. But, it   s been  very useful, I will say that. Had I not had the chemistry I would   ve had  some problems because not all foods are the same, nor as you combine  them do they look the same nor do they taste the same. I was born a  dietician, I will die as one. So when you ask me to dinner, I   m generally  so delighted to be invited since I   m seventy-nine that if you give it to  me, I will eat it. It   s like travelling; if you take me to New York, my  eyes will be as big as saucers. That   s how I am about my profession.  As a little girl, what do you remember eating? What would your mother  cook for you?  My favorite thing in all of the world is the simplest thing. But actually,  it   s very complicated. Ham hock, navy beans, cornbread with a lot of  butter, and any kind of ice cream. But remember, when I say ice cream,  not everybody had a freezer when I was a little girl. You used the top of  the refrigerator, so you had a small amount of ice cream that you could  hold. Now, if you were really putting on the dog, then you would churn  ice cream and wrap it in order to  keep it cold . The churn part, take it  out of the salt and   have you ever churned ice cream?  I have, oh yeah.  Okay, then you know the procedure. You take it out and put it in another  container, then put it in your freezer.  Well, tell me about your parents, what did they do?  My father was a journalist. I never knew a color line. He was a  journalist, people interested him. If they could not speak his language,  he would speak theirs. He didn   t care whether it was right or not. My  mother had to adjust and she called one of the ambassadors of a foreign  country Mr. Potato Head. She didn   t mean to do that, but that   s how it  came out. My father thought it was wonderful and he wrote a story about  Mr. Potato Head. My mother actually did that; she didn   t know. She was  learning a new language, they lived in Central America and Daddy said,     The nicest compliment you can pay an individual is to speak his  language.    That   s what my mother did, so she called the Ambassador  Mr. Potato Head. (Laughter) He took it very well. But I cite that because  7  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  this is how I grew up. My mother and father said,    If you don   t say it, if  you don   t do it right, wrong, or any place in between, that   s the only way  to learn.    So that   s pretty much it.  So around 1929, 1930, you were living in a city?  When I was born in 1929 no, I lived in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. I call it  Tulsa   s backdoor. It   s a little tiny town. It   s still a small community, but  it   s lost a lot of what it was when I grew up early on. I   m seventy-nine  years old so I spent a lot of my childhood in a very small town.  Dr. Henry Bennett was President of Oklahoma State University.  Oklahoma State University was in some kind of trouble with the presses  throughout Oklahoma because they thought that the University of  Oklahoma was the only up-and-coming university when in fact  Oklahoma State University was making great strides. The University of  Oklahoma was going to have to catch up with what they call the    Cow  College,    Oklahoma State University. I   ve always liked that aspect of it.  When you play catch-up, you have to run faster, work harder, to get  ahead. And so that   s what Oklahoma State University did. I liked that.  I   m a graduate of Oklahoma State University, Foods and Nutrition. They  can produce cooks, household cooks that can serve forty to fifty people  and not bat an eye. And when someone says,    Who catered this?    that  used to make me so mad I could not see straight. I did it with the help of  someone who generally helped me. I had that many people. And  somehow I wanted to greet them without a greasy apron. I wanted to  take that apron off and say,    Mary, how nice it is to see you. Jennifer,  what a pleasure. Rick, very nice to see you again.    Rather than being  just down, down, down like I had worked hard all day. That   s not who I  am. I wanted when you walked through my doors to be who it is I am  and I   m so glad that you would take time out of your busy schedule to  come have supper, no matter how simple or how elaborate. Whether I  had known you for forty years or whether perhaps I had just met you, I  was always so glad to see you and I wanted you to be there, and I  wanted you to want to come back again.  Now take in mind, I always had cats, sometimes I had dogs. So when I  asked you, I hoped that you would not mind the livestock that ran  around the yard or sometimes through the house. That   s part of who I  am. My husband died when he was forty-two. He was a professor of  mathematics. I missed him terribly. Did I grieve? I did. Did I continue to  have people in for supper or a bite of this or that? I did. That kept me  from crying. You know, if I could say,    Don   t you want to bring your  wife? And if you have guests for the football game, bring them.     8  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  Tell me how you met your husband.  My lovely husband. I think he met me. I was just your usual college co-ed.  He, however, was a PhD in mathematics. What do you say? That   s  like East meeting South. It happened. And I would say,    But I don   t  understand some of the things you talk about.    He said,    I didn   t marry  you because I wanted you to understand it. I married you because you   re  just who it is you are and you tell it like you see it.    I   m plainspoken; if I  don   t like it, you  will  know it. I grew up that way because it   s cleaner.  I don   t play games. I   m clean about that. If I don   t like what it is I see in  you and you   re related then I   ll tell you that you need to change your  ways. I have three daughters who would agree with that.  We   ll come back to your Oklahoma State days in a second, but when you  were growing up, what did you like to do for fun?  Now remember there were not a whole lot of things to do. What I loved  to do as a child was to jump rope, swim   we didn   t have a lot of  swimming pools. I grew up in a small Oklahoma community, there was  no Country Club. Did you cookout? Yes, you did, but you didn   t call it  cooking out, you called it camping. So we camped, we were out of  doors, I liked to be out of doors. When I was indoors, I loved to draw  and I loved to write. So I was never without something to do. Reading  was part of my life. My father was a journalist, I learned my language. I  was poor at another man   s language, but I was a great cook.  My sister is not such a great cook, but she is wonderful with the  language and she is a coloratura, a voice major. So I learned early on to  sit and listen to Jan play the piano and to sing. Now you say,    How  boring that is when you   re a teenager when you want to curl your hair  and be in perfect condition for your date.    That didn   t happen with me.  When Jan was playing wherever, whether it was in a small town library  room, which they rented for special events, whether it was that kind of  thing or whether they were just using it for a library. We toured the  library. We learned how to check out books. I can remember Puss and  Boots. I loved the cover on Puss and Boots. I wanted to hold it and I  would pet it just as you would a real kitten. That is one of my favorite  memories and until I was about eight or nine years old, the librarian at  my little library when I would go to the library would have that little  Puss and Boots out because I would sit there and pet that just like you  would a real animal. Now, what does that have to do with today?  Because there are animals that need homes, if I find one and I can pet it  and I can make it feel good until I can get it to a shelter, that   s the  amount of good that it does because that   s who it is I am.  Would you listen to the radio growing up?  9  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Yes, loved it.  What shows do you remember listening to?  Oh, I love a mystery.  Do you have sisters?  I do.  How many sisters?  I have a younger sister who lives in Pennsylvania and she was a  coloratura and still sings, but not professionally anymore, she sings in  her church choir. It   s a Presbyterian Church and I   m an Episcopalian and  I think how blessed that Presbyterian Church is to have Jan. And her  husband was called an Irish Tenor. How lucky that church was to have  two such wonderful voices, and I   m still that way. I   m seventy-nine, Jan  is four or five years younger. Jan will say,    I don   t do that anymore, I  cannot,    and I   d say,    I don   t want you to sing the whole thing. Just kind  of hum it so I don   t forget it,    so she can do that and over the telephone  it   s wonderful. So I   ll say,    Jan, how about a little bit of blablablabla?     and she will say,    That   s about all you   re going to get.     So I grew up with the arts; not only the art of painting, but of  storytelling, of reading, that was very important. I was a Home  Economics major, which meant that I had to have X number of hours of  the Fine Arts. I didn   t have to participate, but I had to be able to read and  listen to music. We sat as an audience and the orchestra would begin to  play, my father would say,    What are they about to play?    To say,    I  don   t know,    was not good enough for him. He was very, very hard on  us. If he took the time, he and my mother, to go to Tulsa and we lived in  Sapulpa, which was closer to Tulsa than Oklahoma City. When we went,  we went prepared.  Prepared to do what?  Listen. Prepared to listen. Whatever symphony was playing, whatever     there was a woman performer by the name of Jessica Dragonette. Most  people have never heard of her. When we had to drive to Tulsa (she was  from the east coast) we went and it didn   t make any difference what we  had planned,    Cancel it. We will be going to Tulsa to hear blablablabla.     So would you go to Tulsa often as a young girl?  Yes, yes.  10  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  For primarily the cultural activities?  Yes, yes. Because Sapulpa was a small town, they couldn   t afford that  kind of  entertainment  whereas Tulsa, the oil capital of the world,  could. So we took advantage of Tulsa. Oklahoma City I didn   t even  know existed for the longest time. It was a wide spot in the road because  Tulsa was considered the Metropolitan.  Would your mother make your clothes or would you buy your clothes?  Both. She was a wonderful seamstress. She could take a pattern and if  we went to a store and the clothes were very expensive, Mother would  look at it inside out, then we would go to (they don   t have dry goods  stores anymore) a dry goods store, I would go with her, and she would  say,    Blablablabla. I think this would be nice and this would be easy.  We could use any kind of pattern to achieve what you had seen,    in  whatever magazine I had looked at, or my sister. My sister was more  important because she was a voice major and she needed to look better  than I did. After all, I was just a cook. She was an entertainer. But  entertainers have to eat, also.  Absolutely. We all have to eat. (Laughter)  That was the star in my crown and still is as my family would say. When  they come or as they grew up, they would say,    Mom, but I don   t like  that.    And I   d say,    A cultivated woman has a cultivated palate.    So  with a smile on their face, their little heads would   because they didn   t  want to be from Podunk. They would like to be able to know how to use  a knife, fork, and spoon. I was very good at that and very exacting, any  of the three would tell you.  When you were in Sapulpa, did your mother have a garden?  Oh yes, everyone did. That was during the war. We had a wonderful  house that on one side there were houses, but on the other side there was  just property. It stayed that way for a very long time so we could play  baseball, football, any kind   there were very few trees. You could have  a playhouse where you put together whatever you could find, old  blankets, sheets, whatever, and make your own playhouse. It wasn   t  made out of wood, it was just whatever you could find. Then did you  have a kitchen? You did. Did you supply it? You did. Peanut butter was  the saving grace of my young life.  Why is that? You have to tell me.  Oh  A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you could call it anything you  11  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  wanted to, always knowing that it was just peanut butter and jelly. You  could call it a filet mignon. How many little children know the  difference between a peanut butter sandwich and a filet mignon? Not  many. Not many six, seven year olds. It   s all the same except it tastes  good.  And those were the times when you could get five little tiny lollipops   I  say if you take your thumb, your index finger and squeeze it together, it  would be about that size the lollipop you had. Therefore, you could get  five for eight cents. Real bargain. My allowance was fifteen cents.  That   s pretty good.  Yes. A week.  That was very good.  I could invest in the kind of lollipop I wanted. Now, I don   t know what a  lollipop costs.  A whole lot more than eight cents.  Does it?  Oh, yeah. Well what would you have to do to earn your allowance? Did  you have chores? Tell me about your chores.  Well, I didn   t have a feather duster. I had, depending on what I was  dusting, which was a chore. And the worst chore, and still is because I  have three daughters, was polishing silver. I used to think that that was  the curse that hung over me, was polishing silver and I still feel that  way. It   s not a fun thing to do.  Why? What   s so bad about it?  First of all, the polish doesn   t smell all that red hot. Secondly, it takes  time. And if you   re doing cutlery or flatware, it   s full of little crevasses;  the design in fine silver has a very delicate design. So I would think and  think and think, how am I going to get this done? Mother didn   t tell me;  I   m sure she could have if I asked her, but I didn   t, so I would say,     Mom, do we have any old toothbrushes?    And she   d say,    I think so,  but what are you going to do with them?    I   d say,    Well, just tell me  where they are,    and she   d say,    Well, they   re blablabla    in some kind  of container that is either in a kitchen cabinet or it was likely to be on a  shelf. Then I would get it and I figured out how I could get into all those  crevasses, with a toothbrush. So that   s how I got over that hurdle.  12  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  And the other things were just too numerous. I would kind of blow the  dust from one flat surface to the other until I could really begin to draw  on it and then it was really worth my time to take my dust cloth and do  from here to here and then I would think about from here to there some  other time. We   d have a greater pile of dust. (Laughter) But those were  some of the duties. And we always had duties. We were careful about  drying dishes. There was no such thing as a dishwasher when I came  along. So, you did the dishes in the sink that had a stopper and it was a  double sink fortunately, not everybody had a double sink. And then you  moved them over to the empty sink, then you turned the water on that  that had a little thing that you   d run a piece of rubber tubing to the other  and then squirted all that water on your silverware to get the soap out of  it. Then, you took your clean dust cloth or your clean towel, table towel,  and got them all dry. I put them out on the counter and I presume my  mother put them away, because I didn   t go any further. That was my  duty was to get that done. And just like in today   s world, I didn   t get  paid that much for all of my work, so I only did what I thought I needed  to do in order to make my allowance. No different than today, you   re  just dealing in greater increments.  What do you remember from elementary school?  Now, I always liked school.  Would you walk to school?  Yes. I lived five blocks from school.  And do you remember what it was called?  Jefferson.  Favorite subjects?  Anything   I guess you would say Art and I loved stories, so I liked  books. Books tell stories whether you can read them or whether  someone else reads them. And I   m still that way with poetry; less so  now. My husband had an elegant speaking voice and some of our nicest  times were when I ran across a bit of poetry. Poetry   s meant to be read  aloud and he had such a wonderful voice and I never tired of it. That was  something that didn   t require anything but a book of poetry, my  husband   s beautiful voice, and his audience, for me to hear. That   s one  of my favorite memories. It had nothing to do with our children; this was  something that he and I enjoyed together.  Well, that   s very special.  13  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  He read, I listened. And then if we got into something kind of  complicated as far as words were concerned, I   d say,    Hold up, I don   t  know what that means.    And he   d look at me, because I   m college-educated,  like I was from another planet. I don   t know what he thought.  But that   s what I did pretty much. My interaction. And then as my girls  got older, I had so much I thought,    Please dear God, you have put me to  the test.    Because my children were five years apart in age, which meant  that I always had a child at home. And I would think, I   m getting old,  someone needs to help me with this. (Laughs) Because every generation  has its thing, as did mine, and they   re all grown, all except one have  children. But having said that, the one with no children of her own, she  teaches thirty children. So when people say,    How many children do you  have?    I have to stop and think, well in actuality I have three but Dr.  Laura has a whole house full, she has thirty-five, what am I to say?  (Laughs) It   s good to have family.  Right.  Well you were growing up in the time when things were kind of tough in  the country.  Right, money.  Did you see any effects of that when you were growing up?  Yes. And I like to say   it   s not nice to say, but either you were very  compassionate about the people whom you saw on a daily basis that  either had a hard time making a living or were looking for jobs because  they were not skilled and some had not finished high school. We live in  a generation now where you need to be schooled at least through high  school. College is not always affordable, but I   ve always thought if you  wanted it badly enough, if you wanted higher education you could get it,  you just had to figure out where to go to find out. As far as I know, most  universities offer if you have any kind of decent academic high school  record, some not even high school, you have an opportunity to go on to  higher education with some kind of financial help, which is a good  thing. The more you know, the better citizen you are going to be.  Well, then college must   ve been important in your family     Absolutely.  Were you encouraged to go to school?  Oh, yes. But my father was a journalist, and when he gave up the  14  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  newspaper business, he taught English. He was also multi-lingual; he   d  lived out of the United States. So the foreign students on the campus at  Oklahoma State University were lucky he was there, because they would  call and say,    Richard, we have a very bright student from China. He  needs so much help in his English. Do you have time to teach him?     And almost never did he decline. Because he was from a foreign  country, it was as important for him to teach the student and the student  teach him their customs and their language.  So when your father retired from the newspaper business, which  newspaper did he write for?  The Sapulpa Herald and sometimes the Tulsa World or Tribune, I can   t  remember which or if he did both.  Then he moved the family to Stillwater?  Yes. Because at one time Oklahoma State was in some kind of difficulty  with the newspapers of the state of Oklahoma and so at that time, the  President of OSU knew my father and said,    Richard, would you come  to Stillwater and try to get us out of this mess we   re in with the presses  in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas?    And one more because he could write  syndicated work. But he always loved it. He never met a word he  couldn   t work with, good or bad or any place in between.  So you were able to spend you high school days in Stillwater. Was that a  lot different than Sapulpa?  Yes. But also, I forgot, I spent a year in a girl   s school, which meant that  I learned how to study.  How old were you when you went to girl   s school? Is this before high  school?  How old, Mary Conlee?  About sixteen, for a year or two.  About fifteen. I learned how to study what was important. If you were  looking at a book and you were supposed to   let   s take history, what  was important about the fifteen or twenty pages? The important thing,  not the little things that I would love to read about, but the really essence  of the book or the bits of poetry or short story or the whole book. What  was the important thing to you, to me, to get out of it?  So was this in Oklahoma?  15  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Yes.  Do you know approximately what city?  Until I was twelve, I lived in a little town called Sapulpa. Then, we  moved to Stillwater. So Stillwater was as far as the teaching was a step  above a small town in Oklahoma because Stillwater you had Oklahoma  A M College, which then became Oklahoma State University. Both my  parents went to the University of Oklahoma, so higher education was  very important if you were going to do anything. Well, now that I   m  seventy-nine, I was a registered dietician  RD , I now would be required  to take another test. But having said that, I was a Nutrition major and a  Chemistry minor. I did not like chemistry. It was hard for me. But, I  could see even as a student the importance of the course in order to do a  better job if I wanted to call myself an RD, then I had to know how to  use the chemistry because I didn   t want to make you sick. (Laughter)  And you didn   t want to be sick. And certainly a company you were  working for would not tolerate bad food.  But, as a stay-at-home mom, I never cared how many people I had, all I  wanted was it to be at my house, I wanted it to be a civil gathering, and I  wanted people to be   if it were say hamburgers, hot dogs, a cookout so  to speak, or if it were a very formal dinner, how else were my children  going to learn how to behave at a formal dinner table if they had not  experienced it? How unfair to that child to put them into a spot that they  knew nothing about and make them feel self-conscious. I didn   t want  that to happen to my children, and I could do something about it.  So how did the University of Washington come into play?  Oh, I loved it. I did my graduate work at the University of Washington.  Why there?  Because first of all I had never been in that part of the country. And the  woman that I worked with   I do better with someone who knows the  ropes, and I wanted to do that. My aspirations were to run a first-class  restaurant; not a collegiate dining room or that kind of thing, but a first-class  restaurant. It was one of the best schools in the country. Her name  was Margaret Terrell. She was hard as nails. She would   ve made three  of me and mopped that floor up with me if it were not right. In other  words, when I say fine dining, I mean you sit straight up at a table, you  have a yard square dinner napkin and you have elegant china, glassware,  you know where everything goes, and I learned the easiest way. The  easiest way I taught my children was you start at the outside and work  in. Knife, fork, salad fork, bread and butter, then you have your dessert  16  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  accoutrements here and also your iced tea or whatever.  If you   re serving drinks, you serve them someplace else, except for the  wine, in a family room or out in the open, whatever it is you   re doing.  Make it appropriate, doesn   t have to be fancy, what it has to be is  appropriate and comfortable for your guests. If it isn   t appropriate and if  your guests are ill at ease, you should never do it. If you don   t have the  capacity to make your guests feel easy in whatever kind of environment  you provide, then you have failed. And I like to think that in that way I  have been a success. I want you to be comfortable. Someone said,    But  how do you keep them from eating peas with a knife?    And I said,     Easy. How do you teach a child not to eat peas with a knife? Well,  think about how hard that would be. How would you eat peas with a  knife? Wouldn   t the peas fall all over?     Very difficult, yes.  Right. So why not make it easy for them? Let them use the spoon. Why  not? Then as they get older and dinner service or luncheon, whatever it  is you   re doing, then comes naturally. Let it be a natural progression.  Eating peas from a knife is something else. First, you have to get that  long knife, balance it just right with one hand, at the same time scooping  new peas onto it without dropping them all over the floor. Think how  dexterous all these little hands have to be.  Please tell me you were a teacher at one point.  No.  Oh, you would be a great teacher. (Laughs)  No, I was not. I was a stay-at-home mom. I reared three lovely  daughters. I did public service.  What happened after the University of Washington? Did you come back  to Stillwater?  That   s so long ago. What did I do, Mary? (Laughter) Got married, had a  family, and that was a real trip. I have two daughters that live in  Oklahoma City. My youngest daughter lives in Louisiana and I   m  always hoping that she   s safe because what you see with Dr. Laura is  what it is you get. There   s not a bit of pretense. She has a hardy laugh  and wonderful laughing eyes. And she   s smart as a whip, but she loves  to fish.  Well that   s a good state for her to be in.  17  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  She doesn   t know a color barrier. You know, people are people are  people and that   s how it should be. But in today   s society, that is not  always the way it is. She doesn   t know color, she doesn   t know gender,  people are people. If you don   t speak my language, I   ll learn yours. It  may not be exactly right.  You were able to witness tough times in the country when you were  growing up.  Right.  What do you think about our country today and the tough times we   re  going through? Any similarities?  There are similarities because tough times are hard times and you spell it  h-a-r-d times. Money is scarce. The one thing that worries me about  today, people are far less compassionate than they were when I was  growing up, because there were so many people who did without. So if  you did volunteer work, which I did and loved it, I lived in the Deep  South   oh, so much to be done for so many people and not enough  people to help. So I belonged to a group of women who were dedicated  to helping that segment of the population that could not make it without  help. Because many of them were not literate, many of them could not  hold a job when they had eight children, and how do you tell a person  not to reproduce? You have to draw a line. We   re all forced to draw a  line on some things. How to do it? We still don   t know how to do it  without killing a lot of the initiative of a lot of people. Now, I am of an  era where there were many self-made men. More men than women.  Now, we   re climbing where women can draw down good salaries so that  single moms can provide for children. There was a time when they  couldn   t. And that would bring up a whole different set of  circumstances.  I hear you have this great story about the Capitol.  Oh, I do. One of my favorite memories, my grandfather had reason to  come to Oklahoma City on business. My grandmother was a lovely lady  and I was about five years old I guess, almost six. So we would come to  Oklahoma City. Now, having said that, it took three hours to drive   it   s  not that far anymore is it, Mary? Well, we would go to the Capitol, my  grandfather had business with Bill Murray. He was called Alfalfa Bill. I  used to stand in the rotunda of the State Capitol of Oklahoma and watch  Governor Murray spit. And I do say spit from here, in a complete arch,  to there. And my little eyes followed every move until it plopped. Is that  a good story or not? (Laughter)  18  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Was he spitting into a spittoon, I hope?  Not necessarily. (Laughter) It was to be hoped that it hit, but maybe not.  I never saw anybody get hit in the head with spit but it could   ve  happened when I wasn   t looking. But that I watched. And it didn   t  happen just once. Granddaddy was talking to whomever he needed to  talk to at the Capitol, my grandmother was visiting with the ladies, I was  dressed fit to kill. To this good day I could tell you what I wore in the  winter and what I wore in the summer. I didn   t care what I wore, I just  wanted to sit close enough to someone, generally they were people of  importance. These were old men who chewed tobacco they had to spit  someplace. So they   d walk down here, the spittoon was down on the  first story, they would chew   however you do it, I can   t do it, and then  it would just plop down to where they wanted it to hit. And I used to sit  there and ponder how in the world   because there were all kinds of  people wandering the first floor of the State Capitol, how they managed  not to have spit on their head. I still don   t know, I still haven   t figured  that out and I   m seventy-nine years old. Is that not a good story from a  little girl who was five or six years old? And I just used to ponder. I   d go  home and try to practice. (Laughter)  How   d that work out for you?  Not well. (Laughter) First of all, I didn   t have the right thing to chew  and spit with. All I had was bubble gum. And what was it going to do  but get caught in my teeth and then someone would have to pull it apart.  I   m probably not alone, I think there are children who did a lot of things  like that, we just don   t know about it because they don   t talk about it.  Well outside of Governor Murray and his spitting, which is a great,  great story, do you have any other favorite childhood memories?  Yes. But this is a very good one, I mean it   s from the heart. When I grew  up, there were a lot of stray cats and dogs. I am what is called a bleeding  heart. I never met a stray that I could not bring home. I   m still pretty  much that way, am I not, Mary? I can keep them until I can find them a  home. I live in assisted living so I   m not presented with that problem  now. But before I came to assisted living, I lived in a regular  neighborhood with regular people. But it was a college community and  students frequently have animals that they attach themselves to when  they   re in the university and then when it   s time to go home for the  summer, what happens to all of these little animals? That has always  bothered me. Do you just let them starve to death? What   s going to  happen? If I take them to the College of Veterinary Medicine, are they  going to be used as an experimental animal? Not on my watch. I don   t  think I   d have the heart for that.  19  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  So what did you do?  If I couldn   t place it among my friends, about 75  of the time, I could     I   m an Episcopalian and I used to work with the church, I would go and  look at people, whether I was on the altar guild or whether I was  teaching Sunday School. I would keep my ears open and if someone  said,    Oh dear, Puss and Boots just got run over by the car     or    She just  could not recover from the illness,    I   d say,    I   ve got the perfect answer.  I   ve got one in my backyard.    So sometimes I handled it that way. That  was the best work of all because someone that wanted an animal had  them. Then I had another friend who was my age exactly and Sue and I  grew up together. She was a bleeding heart just like I, so Sue and I  would get together. Her father was a lumberman, so we used to sit down  on the corner in front of the lumber yard; everybody has to buy lumber.  We would sit down there with our little cats and we took turns. Does this  look like a good cat person? And we would say,    We found these little  cats and they need the best home you can give them. Wouldn   t you like  to take this cat?    If it was a mama and she had a four or five year old,  whammo. Perfect, perfect match. (Laughter) That mother wanted to just  do us in. Didn   t make any difference to us, they had a good home.  That   s great.  That was the story that had a happy ending.  Is there anything else you   d like to share with us today? I know we   ve  scratched the surface on many different things.  All right, what do you have in mind?  Well, you tell me. I don   t know if there   s something I missed, if there   s a  good story out there that I haven   t heard.  Is there a good story?  There are lots of good stories.  I don   t know.  What was it like for you to be able to get on your tricycle in Sapulpa,  Oklahoma and ride from your house all the way downtown and not have  it be a big deal at all?  Right. I lived in a small town and you could get on your tricycle and you  could ride it. You knew everybody downtown in Sapulpa, Oklahoma,  what harm was it going to be? None. I knew everybody downtown  20  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  anyway. It   s just that I hated to get caught because I really wasn   t  supposed to do that. I was too far away from where it was I lived and if I  got caught, it meant that someone was going to put my tricycle  someplace where I couldn   t ride it and I would be without  transportation. And that made me very sad.  What would you do downtown? Would you just ride around or would  you go in the stores?  Well, my father edited a newspaper. He was always surprised to see me  and he would say,    Are you supposed to be down here?    And I said,     No,    but getting from where I lived to downtown was wonderful  because it was uphill and downhill. That was a real challenge. And then  when I could see the great town of Sapulpa, Oklahoma, I thought I was  at the end of a great adventure. Did I know where my grandfather was? I  did. Did I know where my father was? I knew better than to find my  father. My grandfather would say,    Vernon Conlee, does your mother  know about this?    And I would say,    Yes.    Well, of course, that was the  biggest tale that you could tell. They didn   t know where in the world I  was. I was just on my own adventure and my own time. Did anything  happen to me? Not a thing. I would look around downtown, hope that I  didn   t see my grandfather or my father.  What did your grandfather do?  He was a lawyer. He wouldn   t have said anything mean for any amount  of money, but I never ran that risk. I just looked at downtown Sapulpa.  You went up a hill and then you went down. Sapulpa was kind of in a  sinkhole as I call it. But it was not too far from where it was I really  lived. And if I really pedaled fast, I would never be missed. Now, if I  dilly-dallied, I was sure to be caught. So I didn   t. I just looked and then  I   d think,    This is how I came to get to this spot, now next time I can go  the other way and go around this spot and be at this spot.    So I had it all  mapped out in my five, six, and seven-year old mind how I was going to  manage this through the summer. These were only summer  environments.  Do you remember the first time you were able to cook on the stove?  Well, I   ve always been a cook.  Do you remember when your mother allowed you to touch it for the first  time?  Yes, but it didn   t bother her. It certainly didn   t bother me. But it wasn   t  my mother so much as my grandmother. I had a very wonderful  21  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  imagination, so the things that I made out of clay, the cookies I wanted  to do with cookie dough. So, my grandmother belonged to some kind of  ladies    groups and they would meet every so often and she used to fool  around with me in the kitchen and say,    Vernon Conlee, here   s some  cookie dough. Do you want to use a cookie cutter or do you want to use  a table knife?    Which would you think I would select? You   ve talked to  me for about thirty minutes.  You   re probably going to want a cookie cutter. No?  The knife.  And why is that?  Because a cookie cutter is dependable, it makes a perfectly round. I   m  not perfectly round. I   m many faceted. (Laughter) So I was going to use  a table knife and I might put part of my cookie as a perfectly round  square, then I would put something else on top that the bottom of it sat  on the original cookie that was not cooked and it kind of plopped down,  so I would just kind of scrunch it together. Then, I was just smart  enough that I would think,    Ha, ha, now if the heat hits this, this is just  going to be a big blob, there will be no wonderful intermingling of  spaces. What I   ll do is put that in the refrigerator and cool it.    Then I  will put it in the oven, turn that oven up and it will be perfect.  Sometimes it was just perfect, sometimes it was just a big blob. I used to  say,    You win a few, you lose a few.    The times I won, oh I was so  delighted. I couldn   t wait to show it to my grandparents or my mother.  My father didn   t think it was too red hot, but if he didn   t like it, why  then I could always take it and I could reshape it and then paint it with  watercolor paints, who knew the difference. Well, of course my family  did and my grandmother would say,    Vernon Conlee, now you cannot  eat it nor can you offer it to one of your friends, it would make them  sick.    If I didn   t like the person, then I   d try to give it to the person.  (Laughter) Which probably would make them throw up.  Probably. Was your grandmother a good cook?  Oh, wonderful.  What would she cook?  She would kind of smile because she was wonderful and for so long I  was an only child so it really didn   t make any difference to her as long  as I did no harm. Now, if you did harm she would sit and say how wrong  that was. And I had seen enough meanness   remember, I came along  right at the end of the Depression where there was still a lot of     22  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Oklahoma wasn   t entirely safe. There were still a lot of mean people  who were mean to lower animals. It   s less so today. I   ve always loved  horses. You cannot not take care of an animal if you have chosen to care  for it. And I don   t like it, it makes me sad and it makes me mad for  people to begin to take on more living things than they can support  financially and I think that is a moral wrong. If you can   t feed and water  what you have, don   t have it. I   m that way. I live in an assisted living  center. I have friends who have pets, I cannot. There   s no place for them,  they can   t run free. There   s no place for a dog to run free. I would have a  cat, I love them. For me, I cannot subject that kind of incarceration on a  small living animal, I cannot. And I don   t like birds. I   d probably do  better with a bird but a bird and a cat are very different. A bird and a dog  or a puppy is very different.  So back in Oklahoma during the end of the Depression, what were  people doing with the pets?  I can   t begin to tell you. Some of them drowned their cats. I mean a very  large   you could go through any creek in Creek County and see cat  carcasses, dogs that had been shot, people couldn   t afford to feed them.  Were you going to let them starve to death or were you going to shoot  the dogs and drown the cats? It amounted to just that much. They  couldn   t feed their children to say nothing of their animals. If their dogs  were foraging   there would be dog fights and one dog lost and one dog  was so hurt in that dog fight over a bone   horrible things. That they  called growing up. But that was during the Depression, the last of the  Depression era, and people had no money. You were likely to see that. It  scared me. I would get down in the bottom of the car. We   d be coming  home from Tulsa and I would get down in the bottom of the floor so I  didn   t have to look because it made me cry and made me sad and I  couldn   t understand how anyone could turn a pet out. I was too soft-hearted.  I wasn   t a hard-hearted Hannah.  Well, that   s not necessarily something to be ashamed about. That   s a  good thing to be soft-hearted.  I was soft-hearted. And I couldn   t, knowing full well that with four dogs  and three cats, we had seven pets that we could afford to feed and to  house because our house was the last house on the block and there were  three blocks of no houses right next to us. So our pets, if they got cabin  fever, could just wander.  So you had seven. Do you remember their names?  No, I don   t. But everybody in the neighborhood   there was one family,  he was a district court judge and he didn   t like my pets. My grandfather  23  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  was alive at the time and he was a hunter so he always had bird dogs and  bird dogs, like other dogs, have puppies. So this man would say,    If that  dog comes and digs up my geranium    (or whatever he had outside)    I   m  going to kill him.    My little eyes were as big as saucers and I   d run  home. To my grandfather I would say,    They   re going to kill my dog      And Granddaddy would have come to Oklahoma first class on the train.  We had to go to Tulsa to pick up the livestock that my grandfather had  sent from Pennsylvania and Oklahoma wasn   t going to make it. You had  to have a Pennsylvania animal. Then, he would pay a call on Judge  Kelso and he was a hunter and he did take a gun and he would say,     Judge Kelso, I have Vernon Conlee a dog that I brought from  Pennsylvania. If I ever see you on that property of mine and you are  being ugly to that dog       Judge Kelso said,    And you   re going to pull  out that gun?    He said,    You got it.    They were both old men. Judge  Kelso wasn   t about to do anything evil. My grandfather knew that, but  he was also a lawyer, so it was just like they were on an opposing side in  a courtroom battle. (Laughter) That   s my best description, but it   s  wonderful and it   s a memory that not too many people have.  That   s great.  And it was all over a cat or a dog, you know? (Laughter) It wasn   t like  they weren   t going to get fed. It was just over possession of a cat or a  dog, what kind of difference that made. But to me, it made a lot of  difference and my grandfather used the language very well also, so  Judge Kelso was always very much a gentleman. My grandfather told it  how it was. If you did this in the state of Pennsylvania, guess what  would happen. Well, I was too little to know what they were always  talking about, but I always knew that it wasn   t a good thing and that I  couldn   t believe my grandfather would do that. But in my heart of hearts  I knew he would because he was a hunter. He had bird dogs. You might  go without something, but those bird dogs didn   t go without a single  thing. And if someone at the grocery store said,    We   re going to start  charging for these dog bones,    Granddaddy would say,    Hope you don   t  come to me again when you   re in trouble because I won   t help you. I  won   t take your case.    It was kind of a tit for tat kind of thing. You hurt  these animals and you get into trouble, they knew he was a criminal  court lawyer, he knew he could stretch the law to the nth degree.  He would probably be a person you would want on your good side.  That   s right. (Laughter) But those are all memories that only take place  in a town no bigger than my fist. It wouldn   t happen in Oklahoma City  unless it was in suburban, almost out of Oklahoma County.  Those are great memories.  24  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  But in small towns in Oklahoma it happened all the time. Only bigger  and better stories.  Well we really appreciate you coming out and talking with us today.  Well, do you think this is of any     Yes.  You do?  Oh, yes.  Well I guess to sum it all up, you might say when I grew up, you made  your own fun. It was within the confine of what my children used to call  a regular neighborhood. We lived in Alabama and Georgia for a long  time where there were regular neighborhoods, where all of the children  of certain ages, they would call it hanging out now but we called it play.  You played dress-up if you were female and your tricycles or whatever  kind of vehicles you had were like cars. And you had doll babies that  you rolled around. I cannot picture one of my granddaughters ever  pushing a baby carriage. (Laughter) Can you?  Well now, my daughter has pushed a baby carriage for fun.  But they   re far more sophisticated than my childhood ever was. The  stories that were read to me were like Little Red Riding Hood and now  there was some blood, pus, and guts granted, but not a great many  stories including that.  Well, also, your name is very interesting. Is there a story behind your  name?  Nope. I have nothing but family names. Vernon is my first name  because that aunt reared my father and his brother because their parents  were killed in some kind of accident so their oldest brother took them  and educated them. They were college graduates, and Watson had to do  with oil in Texas.  Geology.  Geologist. My father was a journalist. He could kill you with his words  and did frequently.  Didn   t they try to draft you, though, into World War II when you were at  OSU because your first name was Vernon?  25  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  M. Jewett  C. Jewett  Yes, I was always a male. You had to write your full name Vernon  Conlee Caldwell. What the hell? (Laughter) You know, who   s that?  So you had to have that straightened out with the draft board.  Yeah. Wearing a skirt, yes. (Laughter) At the draft board, you   re exactly  right. That   s how that played out.  Did they make you sign up for ROTC your first semester?  That   s exactly what it was.  Absolutely. I was getting an F. I was pledging a sorority and someone  came and said,    Conlee, why didn   t you ask for help? You   re flunking  blablabla    and I said,    I am not        Well, we have a notice that you are  not attending class.    I said,    I   m not. That   s for males only. Have you  gotten the gender mixed up? All the accoutrements tell you that I   m  female, so what   s going on here?     Well, I   m glad you got that straightened out. (Laughter)  But what would you expect with a horrible name like they gave me? I  don   t know what my parents were thinking. The Conlee   s all right  because it isn   t l-e-y, it   s c-o-n-l-double e, it   s the female.  Right, I can see why you go by Conlee instead of Vernon.  Right. And Vernon is an absolute nightmare. I got notice that I was  flunking a class in college because there was no Vernon Jewett that was  enrolled, they didn   t even bother to look at the middle name which I  went by and I thought   you don   t want to know what I thought about  the professors. They couldn   t be too smart or they would   ve asked me.  And then either I was some kind of a pervert or I didn   t know what my  gender was, I was not right in the head.  Fortunately, now we   re Mary, Jennifer, and Laura, so there   s just no  mistaking.  Right.  That   s good.  Pretty straightforward, there   s no     Very straightforward, I know. (Laughter) And they were straightforward  with my sister who is Mary Janet. How plain can that be? And here I am,  26  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  C. Jewett  Nykolaiszyn  Vernon Conlee.  They wanted you to have the challenge.  Well, it   s certainly been that. (Laughter) You know, I   ve been enrolled  in things I didn   t even know existed.  Well, thank you once again and we appreciate you seeing us this  morning.  Well, I hope I was not too brazen.  Oh, you were great.  -------  -------
