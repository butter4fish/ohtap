 Wilson  Today is July 26, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Stillwater, Oklahoma, visiting with Eldon  Waugh who is telling me about his memories of the 1930s. Thank you for  having me. Would you mind telling me when and where you were born?  I was born in Rosston, Oklahoma, on September 15, 1925.  And were you born at home or in a hospital?  Yes, born at home.  What did your parents do for a profession?  They were farmers.  What county is Rosston in?  Rosston is in Harper County. It   s just a small town, probably fifteen  miles west of Buffalo. Our address was Rosston for the rural delivery.  Were you the first child?  No, I was the third child. I have two brothers older than I am and then I  have a sister, younger.  Did you live in that house you were born in for some time?  Until I came to college in 1946.  What were some of the main crops your parents farmed?  5  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Well, now they have cattle and wheat, mainly. Of course, during the  Dust Bowl years, the drought and all, they might have a little bit of rye  and sometimes wheat, but very little. As it got better, then my father  raised a lot of grains like maize, kaffir corn and cane.  Where were they originally from? Were they     My father was born in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and my mother was  born in Winfield, Kansas. Their parents moved to Western Oklahoma in  1904.  Do you know what brought them to Oklahoma?  I really don   t, no. Other than that might have been the opening of the  Cherokee Strip, in other words, it   s that area. But when they moved  there, they had to buy their land.  Did they ever tell any stories about moving there or being around when  Oklahoma became a state?  I really don   t remember those. I just remember some of the hard times  that we went through and they went through.  Did your grandparents live near you, growing up?  My mother   s folks lived about   I think it was around five miles and my  father   s folks, probably eighteen, twenty miles, probably.  So did you see them very often?  Yes, it   s kind of unique. My father and brother married sisters. We had  double cousins. So we was at my grandparents    together and their place  or our place quite frequent.  I bet that was fun.  Yes.  How many cousins did you have?  Oh, golly.  Quite a few?  That particular family, they had three. They had one or two others. One  died in infancy and one died of dust pneumonia during the Dust Bowl  6  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  days. And then another family, I think they had about four or five. Some  of them was killed in a car wreck and that just left one male cousin in  that family. I had one uncle that had twelve children. I don   t know     It   s hard to keep up with.  I think my mother   s family, there was two men and three daughters, I  believe. My father   s family, there was one, two, three, four    Four men  and three daughters, I believe.  Would you have family gatherings on certain holidays or just every  weekend?  Well, we   d go to my mother   s folks more often on either Thanksgiving  or Christmas. There   d be a lot of kinfolks then. In later years, we started  to have a Waugh reunion and families would get together and cousins.  We still have the reunion, but my brother, I think, is the oldest living  male there and I   d be the next one. And then I   ve got one cousin that   s a  little older than both of us.  When do you remember the dust blowing in?  Probably sometime in    34 or    35. We were in the Dust Bowl, but kind of  the eastern edge. It was bad enough, but it was worse further west. When  we   d go to school, we had a rural school, we   d wear cloth over our  mouth and you could see where our lips was. The dust would collect on  those cloths. When we   d go to bed at night, get up the next morning and  you could see the outline of our body on the sheet from the dust. We  would use rags to stuff in all the cracks and we even taped the windows  to try to keep the dirt out. Two times, we had to clean the attic out  because one morning we got up and the ceiling was bowing. Got up in  the attic and the dirt was level with the 2x4s. You couldn   t see any light  in through any of the shingles, but still, it got in.  So how would you clean out the attic?  With a shovel and a broom, a dustpan, buckets, and carry it down out of  it. Back then, it was lathe and plaster walls and ceiling. So you had to be  careful not to break the plaster off as you swept the dust up. During the  drought and Dust Bowl, my father built fence on top of fence. Tumble  weeds, I think they was called Russian thistles, would blow into the  fence and the dirt would collect and actually cover up the fence. My  father bought a tractor in    36 with a two row lister on it and he   d strip  farm the wheat ground that we had. When the dust would blow and fill  up those furrows, he   d go in and bust the ridges back and when those  filled up, then he   d go to the place and he   d strip farm and there   d be a  7  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  blank. It didn   t have a list, and he   d go in and list those, trying to hold as  much soil as he could. I think we got down to about twelve cows as I  remember. They were our milk cows. Herded those up and down the  roadways to eat whatever they could and most of the time, because those  Russian thistles would get up maybe six, seven inches high and just turn  brown, that   s what the cattle had to eat.  The Russian thistle?  Yes.  And you were saying about building fence over fence, so the thistle and  the dirt would build up so much?  Build up that deep, cover up the fence, then we   d just build another  fence on top of it.  Wow.  Of course, later years when the Dust Bowl receded, they   d go in and  normally work the dirt away from that, pretty well level it out.  What were some of your chores growing up? How did you help out  around the farm?  Well, like I told you, I herded cattle, I milked cows and probably before  the Dust Bowl was completely over, I was working a team of horses in  the field.  How many milk cows did you originally have before the drought?  I don   t know. We had other, what we call stock cattle, that we had that  just got to where we didn   t have any feed for them.  Do you remember the government coming in and shooting the cattle?  Yes. Yes. We had a few cattle, probably at that time, that they went  through and slaughtered and picked out certain ones. Slaughtered cows  and calves. My brothers, one of them got to go and see them do it, but I  was too little.  Did he report back?  Well, he talked about it. He   s deceased now, but he still remembered and  we   d talk about it some. During that time, I think it was pretty well  documented that Black Sunday, it was just a great big cloud came rolling  8  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  in from, as I remember, from the north. It got so dark the chickens went  to roost. We had a little kerosene lamp on the table and it got so dark in  there, you could barely see the lamp. The dirt, the dust and     What did you think was happening?  No one knew. Because it was as high as you could see and about as far  each way as you could see. It just came rolling in as black as could be.  What did your family do?  That was on a Sunday, and we had kinfolks in for dinner. A lot of them  stood outside and watched it roll in until it got real close and then of  course, they came in the house.  Did you have a cellar?  No, we didn   t have a cellar, we had a basement that was under our  house. The wind and all was blowing, but not any worse than it normally  did out there. What was so unusual was the wind would blow for several  days out of the south, then it might blow several days out of the north.  Sometimes there wouldn   t be any wind, but very seldom. All the metal,  in other words, you go to get in a car, the static electricity would just  really give you a jolt when you got a hold of the knob to open the door.  So you had to work yourself up?  Well, you just went ahead and grabbed a hold of the door and opened it.  (Laughs) And the farm machinery, a lot of it, got buried. In other words,  if you didn   t use it for a period of time, it   d cover up with dirt.  What would you compare the shock to?  You mean the static?  From the static electricity, just to     You ever touch an electric fence?  No. (Laughs)  Well, had more spark than most electric fences have when you get a  hold of them.  Wow.  9  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  I don   t remember this, but I   ve heard them talking about it. Driving a car  down the highway or down the country roads, the dirt just about  sandblasted.  How long do you remember on Black Sunday it being dark?  Well, it come in mid-afternoon. I don   t know, by nightfall, probably  most of it had blown on through. Like I said, I don   t remember much  other than right when it come in and when it happened. Don   t remember  how long it took and that, but I know the kinfolks stayed until, what we  called,    the worst was over.    Then they went home.  And they drove home?  Yes.  So I guess they could see well enough by that time to drive.  Yes.  And then, how long would you say the dust blew, in general?  You mean that day or over the period of years?  Over the period of years.  Probably up through, I don   t know, I   d say    34,    35,    36. In    37 it  probably started to get a little better. We didn   t have any crops to speak  of until probably early    40s. Late    39, early    40s, as I remember.  Were you able to grow a garden during that time?  We raised some potatoes, but the rest of the garden just burned up and  the wind would burn them up. We just didn   t grow a garden.  What was your water source?  We had a well, windmill, that pumped water for us.  Was that very far from the house?  No, it was just maybe less than twenty feet from the house. Good water.  My father plumbed our house early, probably in the mid    30s. We had a  big tank and the windmill would pump pressure into it and we had  running water in our house in, I   d say, the mid    30s.  10  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Wow, that   s pretty early on.  We didn   t get electricity in that part of the country until    49.  Did you have a telephone?  Yes. They had a rural line. The farmers maintained it. They had a rural  switchboard. As I recall, it had at least two different lines. I don   t know  how many was on each line. When the phone rang, if it   s your number  and you went to answer it, you could hear the other phones,    click, click,  click,    down the line. I remember our number was three shorts and a  long or a long and three shorts. Some of them was two shorts, some of  them was three long. You just knew what your number was.  Were you in the habit of listening in on others?  No, I wasn   t. In a way, we didn   t have other communications, so that  was the way to kind of keep up with what went on in the community.  But if it   s an emergency, all you had to ask was if the line was busy, tell  them it was an emergency, and they   d get off the line.  Was there a local newspaper in that area?  We had, I think, Capper   s Weekly was a weekly paper. Then the Harper  County Journal was a weekly paper. I think those were about the only  two my folks took. Later, I don   t know how much later, now, my uncle  took The Daily Oklahoman. But we didn   t take a lot of newspapers.  Was Buffalo a pretty bustling town? Was it the big town nearby?  It   s a county seat of Harper County, so it was    I don   t remember the  population back then. It averaged around 1,300 to 1,500 people, I think.  Would you ever go into town to Buffalo?  That   s where I went to high school. I went to grade school through the  eighth grade in the country school. I rode the school bus to Buffalo. The  first route we had, we were one of the last ones to pick up and we had a  twelve mile ride in. That evening, we had about a fifty-some mile ride to  get home.  Wow.  So the route was over sixty miles long.  How long did that take?  11  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Depending on the weather and roads, we got home at ten o   clock many a  times.  At night?  At night.  Wow. What time did you have to get on the bus in the morning?  Probably around eight o   clock. Seven thirty, eight o   clock. The bus  come pretty close to our home. Our house sat back off the road probably,  oh, I don   t know, a thousand feet? Something like that. So it wasn   t far  down the road to catch the bus.  What was the name of your country school?  Union Center.  Did you walk to get there?  Yes. First year, when my brothers were still going to country school, the  three boys rode one horse. Later, around the road, it was two miles, but  across the field, it was a little over a mile and a half. So most of the time,  we   d cut across the fields to the school house.  So all three boys on a horse.  Yes.  Did that work out pretty well?  Oh, yeah.  Did you have a big saddle?  Well, I sat in the saddle. My oldest brother was the driver, so to speak.  He was in front of me. Then my other brother was behind the saddle. It  damn beat walking.  Yes, I bet  Would you just tie your horse up at school?  They had, at that time, a shed or a barn that you could tie your horse up  in. The others had horses that they rode to school, too.  Would you bring your lunch to school?  12  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Yes.  Was it always the same thing?  No, we ate a lot of ham sandwiches, hardboiled eggs, sausage  sandwiches and occasionally we   d have apples. I don   t remember. Part  of the time, we had these little half gallon syrup pails that we   d use for  our lunch pail.  Did your family have an apple orchard?  There was just no fruit in that part of the country. We didn   t have it. In  that area, there was a lot of wild plums. People with big plums. Got a  quart my sister brought to me a while back, plums that she canned for  me. A lot of our food came in jams and jellies. And in the wintertime,  she   d can them with the pit in them. You   d open up the can and whip  cream and when I say cream, it was pure cream. Whip it and pour over  them and that was really good.  Did you raise a lot of chickens?  We had chickens, I won   t say we had a lot, but we had what we needed.  I don   t know, probably before the Dust Bowl, I just barely remember,  we had turkeys at one time, but too many coyotes around and we didn   t  keep them very long. We went to, I believe it was Rhode Island Reds  was the kind of chicken we had.  Would you have to help slaughter the chickens?  Oh, yeah. I fed them and watered and gathered the eggs. Catch one for  her to fry. No, back then, we didn   t have refrigeration, so chicken, fried  chicken or baked chicken was one of our main meat dishes. We had  pork. My father would sugar cure hams and shoulders and bacon and it  would keep almost all year long.  In a smokehouse of sorts?  No, we kept that in our basement. Our basement was really large and we  kept it there. Once he got it sugar cured properly, then we could hang it  up, but you had it on tables until he got it taken care of. Some of my  kinfolks use smokehouses to cure their meat. We had a lot of pork meat,  but very little beef because, two reasons: we didn   t have them to butcher  and the other was we didn   t have any way to keep them without canning.  Whenever you killed them, you normally had to can most of it.  13  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Were there a few things that your mother would purchase at the grocery  store or in town?  Well, of course, we purchased sugar and flour. Like I say, we didn   t  have any fruit. If we could afford it, we might have some fruit.  Would she get those things in Buffalo?  Yes. Yes. My folks did most of their trading in Buffalo and the ones that  lived north of us, my grandparents, most of them went to Ashland,  Kansas, which is just across the border in Kansas. Buffalo is located,  probably about, not over fourteen miles north over the Kansas line and  about less than twenty miles west of the Beaver County line. Harper  County is right up in the northwest corner of Oklahoma.  Did your mother do a lot of sewing?  Yes. She made her own dresses, patched her kids    clothes, made quilts  and back then, a lot of her dresses were made out of flour sacks. If you  wanted a design or print or color on them, you   d go pick you out a sack  of flour that had a different design or two of them the same so you could  make the dress out of them.  What about bath time before you got indoor plumbing?  (Laughs) Number 10 washtub. Normally, not over twice a week, maybe  just once a week, we   d take a bath. Little ones go first.  Out on the porch or inside?  I remember most of mine was inside. I don   t know, this was probably in  the late    30s, maybe later, but my mother got a    First, of course, it was  a scrub board, which she did most of her laundry with. Then we got a  washing machine with a combustion engine. Big enough that I   d  normally start it for my mother. We had a stove in the basement to  where she could heat her wash water. I tell you, the women, they had to  work. We didn   t raise cotton or anything like that, but to build fences a  lot of times, or certain projects, she had to help my father.  It was hard work.  Yes. We   d do a lot of our chores. In other words, get the horses in, feed  them, milk the cows and all, before breakfast. Our breakfast might  consist of bacon and eggs and hash browns or fried potatoes. Biscuits  and gravy, things like that for breakfast. We   d put in two or three hours  work a lot of times before we ate.  14  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Then would you do some more work after breakfast, or is that when you  went to school?  Oh, sure. That was just getting ready to go to work. Like I said, go out  and herd the cattle in some instances and my dad and brother would go  to the field. We tried to raise crops, but it was just pretty hard to do. Rye  was a crop that we grew and, I don   t know, it didn   t have a whole lot of  food value, seemed to have in it, but it kept our livestock alive.  Would your mother ever make rye bread?  No, we used mostly wheat. We had cornbread sometimes, but  predominately our bread was wheat bread. You can   t beat that, if you  take a loaf out of the oven it was too hot to cut, you just tore it apart and  put butter on it. During those times, my father bought pinto beans by the  hundred pound sack.  Really?  And I still like them. I know every wash day, just about every wash day,  my mother would have beans for dinner and homemade bread. The stove  we had had an oven in it.  So she   d start soaking them in the morning?  Yes. Actually, nowadays, you   d probably start soaking them in the  evening and they   d cook a lot quicker and take less water. I just  remember you had to watch them because if you didn   t soak them and  you started to cook them, you had to keep adding water to them.  What are some other meals she would make?  I know a lot of times Sunday evening, we had bread and milk. Because  normally we   d have a pretty nice meal at noon on Sunday. Of course, the  women, they made a lot of pies. I don   t remember the different kinds,  but pumpkin pie, probably apple pie. Of course a lot of times fruit would  come in from other places. We got a lot of fruit from Grand Junction,  Colorado, when I was growing up. Almost everybody had a lot of  canned food. They   d can fruit when it was in season.  What would they do for entertainment?  Go to church, predominately. Other than that, there wasn   t much  entertainment. Of course, when school was in, they   d have two or three  school programs a year, box suppers, pie suppers. But there just wasn   t  15  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  much    Didn   t have money and if you had money, there wasn   t  anything to buy. About all the money we had a lot of times was what  little cream we   d sold and what eggs we   d sold. Take them to town and  buy what groceries that would buy.  Do you know if you parents had any money in banks when the  Depression hit?  My folks didn   t. We just didn   t have that kind of money.  Well, tell me about pie suppers. What was that like?  Well, the children would put on a program depending on whether it was  Thanksgiving or Christmas or what time the season was, what type of  program we   d put on. The girls and the women would bring boxes of  either cake, pies or fruit, something to eat. They   d put them up for  auction and of course, the boys that had girlfriends would try to buy  their boxes and the men would drive the price up on them, but had a  good time.  What would the money go toward?  School projects. Like the program we put on, we had sometimes  homemade costumes and things like that. Normally, in other words, they  didn   t bring in a lot of money because a box might bring two dollars and  a half. I remember one box supper I went to, the teacher was single and  another, two boys that was dating her, that box went up to probably fifty  dollars. I don   t know where the boys got the money.  I wonder if either one of them got the teacher.  (Laughter) I don   t think so.  What were some activities you would do at school?  Oh, we   d play Annie Over the school building with a ball, like a tennis  ball. We played baseball and softball. Girls would play with us. We  played marbles. We played mummy peg with our knives. Different  times, we   d have tops. We   d spin tops. When we played marbles and  mummy peg, that   s when it costs our mothers to patch our overalls. Did  a lot of crawling around on our knees.  You said eighth grade was the last grade of the country school?  Yes.  16  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  So then for ninth grade you went to Buffalo?  Went to Buffalo, yes.  Was that quite a big change?  Well, yes. Of course, a few of the kids that was in my class at the rural  school went, too. I, of course, didn   t know all the students, but I knew  some of the students in the freshman class. When I graduated from high  school in    45, I think there was only eighteen or nineteen in the class.  The reason it was such a small class was some of the boys had gone in  the service at that time.  Were you eighteen when you graduated?  Yes, I might have even been nineteen. I went three years to high school,  my brothers were drafted and I stayed out one year to help my father  downsize the farming. Went back the next year and finished. In other  words, I was in high school, actually took me five years to finish, but I  was in school four.  So both your brothers were drafted?  Yes. Both of them served in the European Theater.  What branch of the military?  Army. Both of them. My brother just older than I am was in the infantry  and my other brother was in the, I think they called it the replacement  depot. He was in    I don   t know what corps it was, 19th Corps or  something like that. My brother and one cousin, double cousin, went  over together. They went through this replacement depot where my  brother was at and he got to see them before they went into combat.  Did you hear from your brothers very often?  Yes, they wrote my folks as regularly as they could. I don   t know what  they call the letters, but it felt like tissue paper that they   d write on back  and forth. Of course, if they wrote something they wasn   t supposed to,  they cut it out.  So sometimes you   d get letters with holes in them?  Yes. I guess, probably, I don   t know whether if it was the same way for  the letters my mother wrote or not.  17  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  How did the community change at that time with so many boys gone?  Well, you know, we were limited. In other words, you couldn   t buy an  unlimited amount of sugar. You could only buy so much, sugar was  rationed, tires was rationed, gas was rationed, so we didn   t do much  traveling. I didn   t go to town even when I got old enough to drive a car.  Didn   t have the gas and tires to go very often. Then I come to college in     46. We lost a lot of neighbors in the    30s. In other words, there was  about a family on every half section at least, now there   s probably not a  family on two or three sections.  Did you know many people that went to California?  I knew several that left the country. Some of them went to California,  some of them went partway, into Arizona and Nevada.  Did you ever hear from any of those people that left after they were  gone?  Well, my folks probably did, but I don   t remember. I know those pinto  beans I was talking about, one of the farmers that left that neighborhood  went out there and was involved in growing beans and he   d bring back  sacks of pinto beans. In fact, my father bought me a big sack of peanuts  one time as my Christmas present. A lot of our toys, we made. My sister  was quite a bit younger than I am, but we   d play together. Use nails for  fence posts and twine for fence, cardboard horses and cows.  Would you get toys at Christmas, ever? Or something to play with?  I had one grandparent that bought us toys sometimes. But normally, we  might get clothes and things like that more than we got toys.  So you learned to be pretty innovative.  Yes. All we had    I don   t know where it   s at. We had another little  Model-A Ford with a rumble seat on it and I had another Model-A like  that one, the Model-T, only it was a big red one. We don   t know what  happened to those two.  Show these on the video. So these are some of the things your  grandparents would buy for you?  Well, I don   t know whether my grandparents or my folks bought those.  We had one big truck, about so long with a metal bit on it that all three  of us boys played with. Those are the only ones I wound up with. I don   t  know whether my other brothers wound up with any or not.  18  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Those are pretty sturdy.  Yes.  That   s neat.  But our toys were durable, as you can see.  Yeah, they weren   t designed to fall apart and make you buy some more.  Yeah, they were designed if you take care of them, they   ll last.  Well, that   s wonderful you still have those. Did your family have a  radio?  Oh, we had a radio. I don   t remember when we got it. We had a wind  charger and all we had, I think, was one light bulb in the house and the  radio was operated off of a car battery. We   d keep it charged and my  father liked to listen to one news program they had on in the evening. If  the battery is up, my brother and I would run home so we could listen to  Jack Armstrong or Orphan Annie or Green Hornet before it was time to  start chores. But if the battery wasn   t up, we had to leave what little was  for my father to listen to the news.  Would you ever listen to Fireside Chats?  I don   t know whether they had them back then or not. I   m trying to think  of the one that during the war    My dad listened to Walter Winchell, I  think was one, and there   s another one. We entertained ourselves other  ways or had chores to do.  Did anyone in your family play musical instruments?  One brother just older than I am played the violin. My sister was real  good on the piano. She can hear one of the church songs and sit down  and play it by ear.  What church did you grow up in?  I grew up in Union church, but my folks were Methodist. My sister and I  jumped ship, I guess. We   re both Baptists. My two brothers were  Methodist. Like I say, we grew up in this rural church, which was inter-denominational.  Did your parents have a car pretty early on?  19  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  They only had a Model-T. I remember it just a little bit. Then they got a  Model-A. In    29, my father bought a truck, a    29 Chevrolet. Some of the  farm equipment, combine and binders and things like that, my uncle and  brother, uncle and dad and his brother would go together and buy. In  other words, use and harvest their wheat together. It was when the  economy started getting better, we had a lot of oats and wheat to shock.  My dad cut a lot of wheat with what they call a header. Then they had a  barge and run the straw up into the barge. When I was big enough, I  drove the team to the barge.  Did your parents talk about politics, much?  Not a whole lot. I think my father was a Democrat and my mother was a  Republican and in the county there, they knew the people. They voted  for the individual rather than party.  Do you remember hearing about the Works Project Administration?  Oh, sure. Sure. WPA.  Were there many projects completed in your area?  I don   t remember a lot of projects. There was commodities. Some people  got commodities. My folks and kinfolks, as far as I know, never took  commodities. Not until the CCC Camp. It was a camp there in Buffalo  and those boys started planning the wind breaks and doing some soil  erosion projects. As far as the WPA, I just don   t remember. I know some  of them come in and built some bridges, culverts, things like that. But  other than that, I don   t remember anything.  I   ve heard some people talk about things like plagues of rabbits or  grasshoppers. Just a whole lot of them.  (Laughs) Yes, we had jackrabbits you wouldn   t believe. They would  have jackrabbit roundups and they   d get out there with men with  shotguns and clubs. I imagine at one time, they had almost a semi load  of jackrabbits.  What would they do with them?  I don   t know. I know I have a picture somewhere with my father and the  three boys of us sitting down on a pile of jackrabbits, probably a dozen,  that my father had killed. As I got older, I had a .22 that I could    I was  old enough then, I was driving. Probably fifteen, fourteen, fifteen,  driving. I   d parked my pickup and shoot up a box of shells without ever  20  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  moving. You shoot one rabbit and he   d come see why he was kicking  and you   d shoot him and it   d be two or three more come. It was thick,  thick, thick. Then we had the plague with grasshoppers once or twice.  They   d literally eat bark off of trees. You   d go out on a hot day like this,  see a fence post and they   d be on the shady side just top to bottom, just  as thick as they could get on it.  Was there any way to treat that?  Well, back then, we didn   t have much for them to eat up, I guess. One  person, I don   t know where he lives now, but there used to be east and  north of Buffalo a herd of turkeys, and he actually fattened his turkeys  out on grasshoppers. Of course, every farmer wanted him to come by.  Yeah, I bet. I guess they might be a good source of protein.  Yeah, it seemed to. In other words, he had a nice flock of turkeys.  Taking advantage of the situation.  Have you ever seen one of these big green grasshoppers that didn   t have  any wings? It can hop.  I don   t know.  One time, I took a, I don   t know, a probably two-gallon pail, maybe  three-gallon pail, to one of the herding cattle. We had wild sunflowers. I  think that bucket got two thirds full of those big green grasshoppers. I  brought them in and fed them to the chickens. And of course, like I said,  we was far enough east on the Dust Bowl, we would have some things  grow. Some people called them pig weeds and what do they call it?  Lamb   s quarter?  Oh, yeah.  That was our spinach when I was growing up. My father didn   t care for  it, but my mother and I did. So a lot of times when I   d come in from  herding the cattle, for dinner, I   d take my shirt off and fill it up with  lamb   s quarter and she   d cook it for me.  It   s not bad stuff.  No. I know there   s a lot of things I should remember that will probably  come to me later.  Well, it has been quite a while.  21  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Yes. Back then as a person growing up, you   d just kind go of day by day  and the grownups is the ones that had to worry to clothe and feed us.  Do you recall what the first picture show was that you saw?  I don   t know if it was the first one, but one of the first ones was the John  Deere show that would come to town. It showed the pictures of the first  John Deere. It was a plow that John Deere had developed. It had a metal  blade on it. Of course, I watched it two or three times that day. Like I  say, I don   t know whether it was a sales pitch, but it was put on by the  John Deere Company and they had quite a display in Buffalo. Didn   t  have anything else to do, so I just sat and watched that over and over.  (Laughs) Did you have to pay for it?  No, not that one, I don   t think. Of course, back in my day, when  Hopalong Cassidy and Buck Rogers and   I don   t know if Dale Evans  was back then or not. Most of them was wild west shows. Hopalong  Cassidy was one of the main ones that they showed a lot of.  Tell me about high school graduation. What do you remember about  that?  Well, having a split class    In other words, the class I went three years  with graduated and then I went back and graduated with the last class. I  remember probably about two-thirds of the ones that was in that class. I  remember more of the classes I went three years with. Our school was  interrupted a lot because of the war. My English course, I think I had  either three or four teachers.  So they would have to go contribute to war efforts?  Well, I don   t know necessarily the turnover other than whether they got  a job somewhere else teaching or whether their husband left or what was  the reason was we had so many turnovers.  Did they hold an actual graduation ceremony?  Yes. But my class    All the previous classes got to go on a   what do  you call it? A trip?  Oh, a senior trip?  Senior trip. My class, they wouldn   t let us go.  22  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Where did the class before you go?  I really don   t know. My brother   s class, I think, went to Southern  Oklahoma and then Arkansas and back.  Did they just decide there wasn   t enough financing or   ?  Well, you   re limited on gas and tires. I think our class had the money or  probably could have, in other words, things got tight enough that they  just couldn   t afford to let us go on the trip.  So did you have plans? Did you know what you were going to do after  you graduated?  Well, let   s see, I graduated in    45 and I came over here in    46.  In the fall of    46?  No, the spring of    46. I had asthma all my life and it   s one reason I guess  I came to school. I was told by a physician that I shouldn   t farm because  of all the grain dust, other allergies around like cattle, horses, things like  that. I decided to come over here to OSU to school. I took electrical  engineering as my major.  Had you been to the OSU campus before you came in the spring of    46?  No.  How did you get here?  I had a friend that had come over in the fall of    45, I believe it was, and  through him, we lived in what was then FarmHouse. College still had  jurisdiction over it. In other words, during the war, the government took  over the dorms I think and the fraternities and sororities, a lot of them.  Rather than being a sorority, students would live in the houses. But  shortly after I started, the military left in the fall of    46 and I moved to  Cordell Hall. We didn   t go home every weekend like the students do  nowadays. I might come home Thanksgiving and I might go home for  Christmas, but those were about the only two times I went home.  Did your parents drop you off at college or did you have a car?  No.  (Laughter) Really? You thumbed it all the way to Stillwater?  23  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  No, my folks brought me over and got me enrolled and I was pretty  much on my own from that time on over here. But when I went home,  I   d either go on a bus at that time or friends that lived at Buffalo, I   d  catch a ride with. I didn   t have to ride the bus very many times because I  didn   t go home much.  Well, what were some of your first impressions of the Stillwater  community and the OSU campus at that time?  Crowd. At that time, the GIs were coming back and the campus was  covered with Quonset huts. Little Quonset buildings. Cold in the winter  and hot in the summer. I don   t remember how many started out in  double E  electrical engineering , probably a thousand. After the first or  second year, one of our double E courses, we were just told if we made  that one, we could stay in or if we didn   t, get out. Most of them got out.  Do you remember which course that was or who the professor was?  No, I can see him, but I don   t remember his name. I didn   t have a lot of  background like a lot of your bigger schools. In other words, I had to  take some zero hours in math especially to be eligible for upper math  courses. Oldest friend from that that I roomed with at the fraternity  house started out in electrical engineering, but he said he found out that  wasn   t for him, so he changed his major.  Do you remember any of the buildings you had classes in?  Of course the engineering building, I had a lot of classes in it.  Did you have any classes in Quonset huts?  Oh, a lot of classes in Quonset huts. History, English, some of my math  courses. Engineering courses were about the only ones I didn   t have in  the Quonset building. My chemistry class was in, we just called it the  chemistry building, then. It has another name. It   s no longer standing, I  don   t think.  What about Old Central, did you have any classes there?  No, I didn   t. The FarmHouse, at the time, was just across the street from  that. The president   s home was right there not far from Old Central.  I didn   t realize FarmHouse was located over there.  Yeah, it was just across the street.  24  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  And were people living at the fire department at that time?  Yes. Yes. We ate in the cafeteria located near the, I want to say the  electric station, but I   m not sure. They had a big shack that they  demolished before I left college. We ate there at that cafeteria the first  semester and then after that I ate in Cordell Hall.  Did you have a job while you were in college?  No, I carried I think sixteen hours. Like I said, I spent most of my time  studying. Looked out the window and watched a lot of men play softball  and volleyball and things like that, but I had to study.  Did you make it to any sporting events or musical events?  Oh, yes. I went to most football games and most basketball games.  Basketball games, even number would go one time, an odd number next,  but there was enough in the dorm that didn   t go, so I normally went to  most of the games.  Do you remember any of the major players at the time?  Well, in football it was Van Poole, Armstrong, Davis, Spavital    First  year, Fenimore was still playing in    46. Floyd Gass, I think, was on that.  Then in basketball, Bob Harris was center, Shelton was a center later on,  Al Bennett, Joe Bradley    I always thought, who was the coach that  took over after Iba? Aubrey. Sam Aubrey. I think there was a Williams  on that team, basketball team. Of course, back then, they had both  freshman and varsity. Not sure, but I think Mo Iba might have been on  the freshman squad, but I   m not sure. Gale McArthur and Pilgrim and  some of those guys were on the freshman squad.  Did you go to any wrestling matches?  I went to a few. I didn   t especially care about wrestling, but my  roommate I had at Cordell was. I enjoyed it, but I got too involved. Play  out during wrestling matches. I got to where I didn   t go. After I moved  here, I went mostly to football, basketball and baseball. I didn   t go to a  whole lot of baseball, but I did go some.  What about dances? Were there any dances on campus?  There was, but I   m no dancer. (Laughter) My sister got all the musical  talent and I don   t have an ear for music. I never learned to dance.  Were there any hangouts on campus that you would go either study or  25  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  go for a coffee or meet anybody?  Oh, I had friends that on Friday night would go to the beer joint. They  bought me a bottle of beer, but I didn   t drink it, so they didn   t buy me  anymore. I didn   t have money. My folks didn   t drink, they didn   t smoke.  I just wasn   t around it. Plus, the fact that I got a watch when I was,  supposed to have got it when I was twenty-one for not smoking. When I  came to college, I was twenty. I think they bought me a watch anyway.  So you might as well keep it up.  Right. No, like I said, back when I was growing up, there just wasn   t any  money. So we didn   t get allowance, we got our clothes and things like  that. If we needed money to go to a show or something, they   d give it to  us. We didn   t have an allowance. My father paid for my college  education, which was about    I think one year cost me six hundred  dollars for my room and board and my schooling. That was quite a bit of  money back then.  Tell me more about the electrical engineering program. Did you decide  early on that that   s what you wanted to do and you stuck with it?  That was kind of in a way a going thing, I guess, after the war was  electronics, electrical    My major was electronics, but I had all the  power options probably but one course. I could have had a power option,  too. During my working career, I did mostly all mechanical work. I  worked in a power plant for thirty-seven years.  Did you get that job right after college?  Well, not right after college. I got married August of    50. Graduated in  May of 1950, got married in August of    50, and went to work at the  electric company in September of    50.    50 was a busy year.  Yeah, it was.  I went to work at Woodward Power Plant. I was transferred to  Oklahoma City. Worked at the Belle Isle Plant, transferred to the  Mustang plant, then was transferred to the Sooner Power Plant as Plant  Manager.  Out here on the way to Ponca City?  Yes ma   am. I was the first manager of that plant.  So was it a brand new plant?  26  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Yes. Moved to Stillwater in    78 and they put the first unit on in    79. I  was black headed or dark brown headed when I came up here and it was  white a few years later.  Was it pretty tough?  Well, getting people was. We built plants over at Muskogee and we   d  normally staff a new plant with people out of one of the existing plants.  Well, they staffed their own units over there. When it came to my time  to staff this plant, we was only able to transfer in fifty people and only  four of those had ever been supervisors. Myself and three others had  ever been supervisors. So we had to bring them in, train them    Some of  them had never seen a power plant before. We made it fly.  What year did you retire?     87. October   87. Thirty-seven years and a few days.  Well, how did you meet your wife?  Blind date here at school. (Laughs) A friend of mine that lived at  Lexington, Oklahoma, at a football game one Saturday, he was going  home Friday night and he said he could bring some girls back if I   d take  one of them. So he and his cousin came back with three girls. That day it  rained all during the game. My girlfriend and I sat under a   we had a  raincoat over our laps and a raincoat over us, we huddled together.  (Laughter) Kind of odd and strange. She was going to school, at that  time, OCW  Oklahoma College for Women  in Chickasha.  So she lived in Chickasha?  She lived in south of Norman. She went to high school at Washington,  Oklahoma. Her mailing address was Purcell, but like I was, mine was  Rosston, but I went to Buffalo High School.  And what was her name?  Norma Lee Weeden.  So when was that first date? Was that in the fall of    49?  Fall of    48. She graduated, I think, in    48 and was at Chickasha. She  came up here, I think it was in    49. Yes, I believe it was the fall of    49  that she came up here. Wait a minute       48? I don   t remember. It  seemed like she was here longer than two semesters.  27  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Did she get a job or did she go to school again?  She worked in the cafeteria. One of the cafeterias. Where did she live     Murray? I believe it was Murray Hall she was in, and she worked in the  cafeteria. Now, I didn   t get a car until I think Christmas    48.  What kind of car was it?  1948 Plymouth. Like I told you before, we didn   t get allowance or  anything like that. By that time, my father had done better in his farming  and all. Went home at Christmas and he asked me if I wanted to go up to  the car dealership and look at the cars with him. Back then, you had to  sign up for cars and this dealership, if a car come in that a guy had  signed up for, if that wasn   t what he wanted, he   d sell it to anyone who  wanted it. My dad had bought it, I didn   t know it. We took it out and  drove it. He asked me how I liked it and I said,    It   s quite a car.    We got  back to the dealership, he talked to the dealer a little bit and just handed  me the keys and said,    It   s yours.     Do you remember your reaction?  (Laughter) Probably dumbfounded.  Yeah, wow.  Always a family like that. My dad helped me quite a bit. Like I said, we  just worked there and whatever we needed to do, and we got our food  and clothing and necessities when we was growing up. When he got a  little better off, he started helping his family. I was fortunate, I went to  summer school, I think two years here, and then I worked at home for  two summers. Again, my salary was my schooling.  Where did you get married?  Washington, Oklahoma, August 11, 1950.  And then you two moved to Stillwater?  Moved to Woodward.  Oh, Woodward.  Then from Woodward to Oklahoma City. We were there from    53 to     78, I guess. Yes, Norma Lee passed away in January of 2010.  28  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  How many children do you have?  Three.  And what are their names?  Suzanne Witt, now, Jerry Kent Waugh and James Waugh.  Well, I know at some point, you got interested in bees. When did that  happen?  Around    72, a swarm of bees came to the Mustang plant where I was  working. One of the fellow workers there wanted to catch them. He  came to where I was working and asked me to go with him and I told  him I couldn   t, I was busy. About thirty minutes later, he came back by  and said,    Looks like we   re going to have to let those bees go, no one  will help me.    I   d never been around bees, but I said,    Well, I   ll go with  you.    We captured that swarm of bees and I started reading and  studying. We had that hive together and then later on we split. We  caught us another swarm or so and he took some and I took some.  What was his name?  Pete Roland.  So did you end up with many hives in Mustang?  I think I had probably ten hives was the most I had until I retired. Since I  retired and with the lady that helped me, we built up to probably  between eighty and ninety hives. More than we can take care of, so we  dropped back. I think when we divided, we had about sixty colonies. I  took about twenty and she took the rest of them.  Will you explain the process of identifying some bees and taking the  colonies?  Most of the bees that are in this country are considered an Italian strain  of bees. When you go to catch a swarm, they   re normally pretty docile  because they   re full of honey and can   t bend their stinger to sting you.  So I have worked just like I   m dressed now, but to protect my eyes, I  normally always put a screen on them.  Which is like a hood?  Yes, a hood with wire mesh around the front of it. The way I do it  nowadays, if the bees are on a branch or something, I   ll set my box up,  29  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  take a cloth and put in front of the hive, up to the entrance to the hive,  instead of cutting the branch off like they used to, I just shake them in a  box or a bucket. Pour them in front of the hive and they   ll just march in  like little soldiers.  So you shake the branch?  I just shake. Shaking the jars in there, hung on the branch in a big cluster  like this. I   ve got some pictures I   ll show you. You just slip the box  under and shake them and they just go ka-plunk in the box. There will be  some flying around, but if you get the queen to go in there, if you leave  it until dusk, all the bees will be in. They will pick up her pheromone  odor and go into the box.  Then what do you do with it?  Take it and put it in your apiary. In other words, I   ve got a location out  northeast of town that   s got about sixteen hives now and one out east  that   s got five on it. I   ve got some down south that last time I checked, I  have five now south of 33 Highway.  So what makes a good location? How do you know what a good location  will be to keep these?  When you   ve got a lot of flowers, you   ve got to look where there   s  flowers, but you have to be careful not to put them where they   ll use  insecticide. In other words, I like alfalfa honey, but you   ve got to be  careful because a lot of times they   ll spray it for the green bugs and web  worms and things. So I try to place them where they don   t use  insecticide. We   ve got them on two garden plots. One of them, the guy  is knowledgeable enough that he doesn   t use poison that   s real toxic to  bees. He uses it late at evening when it starts getting dark. Most of the  bees will be back to the hive and what few he kills won   t hurt you.  Normally I harvest honey. We used to call it robbing it, but they   d say  that   s wrong. You harvest honey now. In July, you get light honey in  July. The harvest again in September, you know how much to leave on  the hive for their winter stores. If they   ve got excess, I take it. It   s  normally darker. The colors depend on the flower that they   re getting the  nectar from. Clover and vetch honey is light and mild tasting, and as you  go up in color on the honey, it   ll get stronger tasting. In the past, in good  years here, I   m averaging about sixty pounds per colony. That   s five  gallons of honey per colony. Some colonies will make you eight or ten  gallons and some will make you two or three.  Do you have an estimate at all of how many bees are in a colony  generally?  30  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Well, a real, real strong hive can have around seventy to eighty thousand  bees. They   ll go into winter like that, but by spring, they may be down to  fifteen or twenty thousand. That   s enough for them to rebuild.  How long have you seen colonies last? For years and years?  There again there   s your variables. We   ll have some that you   ve had for  a long, long time and some of them the queen will die or the colony will  get weak for some reason. When you get a weak colony, there   s a moth  that will move in and lay eggs and they just decimate the hive.  Normally, if I go into winters with say twenty colonies, I might come  out with fifteen in the spring. They may starve to death, they may freeze  out or the queen may die. Just different things. Since    95, we   ve had a  mite problem. The tracheal mite gets in their breathing apparatus and  kills them, and the veroa mite is kind of like a tick on a dog. I   ve been  treating mine, trying to control them that way. Last year, a hive beetle  moved in and I have no experience on that, yet.  How do you treat the mite?  I treat it with chemicals. They started out with a chemical called Apistan  on plastic strips that you put in the hive. Then they came out with a, I  don   t know what it   s called. Miteicide, I believe. It has some type of  acid odor to it. I want to say phosphoric, but I don   t think that   s quite  right. It doesn   t hurt the bees, but you don   t use any of these chemicals  during what we call the honey flow. Normally in the late fall, early  spring before you start getting the honey flow.  If a colony is damaged for any reason or disappears, is the honey they  leave behind still good, generally?  It depends. Say they get weak and you get to it before the wax worms  take over, yes the honey is still good. I don   t recommend harvesting the  honey out of one that died out due to pesticides. I used the word  insecticides, it is pesticides.  Have you been stung very many times?  (Laughs) I lost count a long time ago. When I first started, I was mildly  allergic. In fact, I   ve had my hands to where I couldn   t close them for  about three days. Got stung across the back. I checked with the doctor  and he said you   ll become more sensitive or less sensitive. The secret to  me was to get the stinger out immediately. When a honey bee stings you,  they leave the poison sac there and it continues to pump. They say take a  knife or a credit card or something and scrape it off. Don   t take that  31  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  time. Take your fingernail and brush it off or just put pressure on it and  brush it off. You may break the stinger off and leave a little dark spot,  but it soon dissolves and goes away. As quick as I got to where I got  most of the stingers off    I could be stung and ten seconds later, I don   t  know that I   ve been stung.  That   s good advice, then.  When one stings me, I   ll jump just like you do but it doesn   t last very  long for me anymore.  So have you typically sold your honey at the farmer   s market?  Yes.  How many years did you do that?  About twenty-three. This is the first year I haven   t been a member of the  market since it was organized. I just don   t have any honey to sell,  period. I may not have any to harvest, I don   t know.  Because of the drought and the heat? Extreme temperatures.  I   ll tell you, there just wasn   t any flowers. Partner and I checked them  probably three weeks ago. We could have probably harvested eight or  ten supers at that time if we had the insurance that there   d be flowers  later, but there   s not, so I didn   t want to take it. Those ten supers would  have made me approximately twenty two gallons, maybe as many as  twenty-five gallons of honey.  And what is a super?  They come in boxes. In other words, you   ve got a certain part of it that   s  called your hive body, where the bees raise their little and you put  another box on top of that. That   s called a honey super or surplus box.  After they fill that up with honey, that   s the one we take and harvest the  honey out of it. You wait until they cap for honey. When they cap it,  they say it   s ripe. It   ll keep. If you harvest honey before it   s capped, it  can ferment on you because it still has too much moisture in it.  How do you know when it   s capped?  Just check it. Open the box and look.  What does it look like if it is?  32  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  It   s covered with a coat of wax.  Oh, okay.  Covered with a coat of wax. I don   t know if you can see in my  observation hive, they   re starting to use the honey that they brought in,  but I think they have got a little section that   s still covered with wax.  So when did you create your observation hive?  Well, I had one in the City for a while and then when I come up here, I  built these. I   ve had them probably at least twenty-five years. I   ve lived  here, this will be thirty-three years here in Stillwater. It   s been between  twenty-five and thirty years since I   ve had it there in the window.  I   ll probably take a shot of those with the video, but it   s a wooden frame  with glass panels. Is it plastic or glass?  It   s plastic. When I could see, I could disconnect them and plug them up  and take them to schools and show them to school children and tell them  about the bees.  That   s wonderful. Do you know if there   s anyone else that does that?  This lady that helped me for about twelve years, she was interested, but  she   s left now, so I don   t know if this lady that   s helping me now     She   s got other chores, so I don   t think she   d have the time.  It   s really fascinating, and I remember you coming to my elementary  school in Stillwater. Just watching bees is something that a lot of people  never get the chance to do.  My mobile meal people, I   ve showed everyone that   s brought mobile  meals, and the lady that came today had a friend with her. When they  brought the meal, she turned to me and said,    I   ve brought this friend,  now I want you to show him your bees.     (Laughter) It   s really fascinating. I bet you can just spend hours  watching them.  My wife used to say I wasted a lot of time. (Laughs) To me it   s still, if I  could see better, real interesting in the spring. That   s when we call the  buildup. The queen will quit laying in the fall and won   t lay until the  spring, and what seems to stimulate her to start laying is when they start  bringing in pollen. When they start bringing in pollen, she   ll start laying.  They don   t need pollen to survive, but they need pollen to raise little  33  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  ones. That   s their mineral and vitamin source. Their actual food source  is the nectar, the honey. But in order to raise little bees, they   ve got to  have pollen.  And did you say you can, just by looking at honey, determine what their  pollen source was?  Well, when I could see, at one time, I could tell you about four different  pollen sources. Dandelion, elm and then some of these other flowers.  Dandelion is bright orange, elm tree is kind of a grayish color, I   ve had  some that   s almost black and I   ve had some that   s almost white. I forget  what those was now.  Will you explain for the tape what to look for when you   re looking for  the queen bee?  Well, the queen bee is larger. She   s got to be enough longer to be able to  back into the cell and lay an egg in the bottom of the cell, which is the  same size as a little bee. So her legs and thorax and her head is that  much bigger. Then too, the spot on her back, on her thorax, is a lot larger  and shinier than the worker bees. That   s the way you can tell. My  partner and I, we started marking our queen when we can catch one, find  her and catch her, we put a little white spot on that black spot or green or  whatever color pen we   ve got.  That sounds difficult.  Well, once you learn to spot the queen    In other words, one of these  big hives I was telling about, 70,000, 80,000 bees, I   ve been able to find  them in just a little bit, know where they   re at in the hive. Now, I just  can   t see them to find them.  Is there usually more action around the queen or less?  The period of the day kind of makes a difference. In other words, once  she mates, she never leaves the hive unless it   s a swarm. So they   ve got  to feed her, clean her, and take care of her. A lot of times, she   ll be  laying in kind of a horseshoe shape of worker bees around her, she   ll be  laying in the middle like this. Sometimes you can pick the queen up that  way. But if she   s busy laying eggs, it   s pretty hard to find her because  you don   t see the length of her body because she   s got her tail down in  the cell.  Do you know how long a queen bee can live if the conditions are right?  They say she can probably live up to at least five years, maybe longer.  34  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  But after two years, her egg laying capacity starts falling off and your  hive will become weaker. So if your queen lives two or three years, they  kind of hope they re-queen themselves. A queen gets   I don   t want to  use the word ill, but starts to failing. They can recognize that, and a lot  of times they will what they call supersede. They   ll start feeding another  larvae. The only difference in the queen and the workers is the way  they   re fed. The first three days, they   re fed royal jelly. The queen and  the workers and the drones are all fed royal jelly for three days. After  three days, the workers and the drones are fed pollen. A pollen diet. The  queen is fed royal jelly the entire time. Her ovaries will develop and she  develops into a queen.  And what is royal jelly?  That   s the substance the bees secrete out of their head, they say. It   s a  white substance, it looks almost like Crisco.  Wow.  If you get me started on bees, I won   t know when to quit. (Laughter)  Well is there anything else we should say for the moment about bees?  Just in general? Do you think that bees will be around forever?  Oh, I think so. They   ve been here since the beginning of time. You  know, the Bible mentions milk and honey.  So they might have a bad summer or two, like this year, but     Well, and location. Locations might have bad areas. I firmly believe a lot  of our problems with our bees have been brought in from foreign  countries. In other words, this tracheal mite and veroa mite problem has  been over in the Balkan states, in Ukraine, for years and years. But it  only came over here probably about twenty years ago, now. It hit here in  Oklahoma about    95, I think it was.  Have you encountered any Africanized bees yet?  No. A guy needs to be real careful when you go out to work bees now,  to make sure they   re not Africanized. This lady that helped me for a  number of years, we caught probably thirty swarms that year. Then we  was told later, it had come out in the paper, they killed a bunch of bees  that was Africanized, but they found out that they wasn   t. My  understanding, an exterminator is not supposed to kill honeybees unless  a beekeeper tells them that they can   t get them or they   re a hazard to the  people around. In my time working bees, I   ve only turned one job down  35  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  removing bees from a building. They had asbestos siding on them, so I  knew I didn   t dare remove any of those. I told the people and the  exterminator went out and killed them. But really, they   re kind of a  protected species.  And a real important commodity. Honey has all kinds of health benefits.  Yes, really we look at honey as the main source, but the biggest  advantage of having bees is pollination. Without that    Well, we  wouldn   t have a lot of fruits. Almond trees won   t produce without  pollinators. I   ve been told, like blueberries back East, without bees, their  crop fell about two-thirds. They only got about two-thirds the amount of  blueberries they would have if they had pollinators. I had my bees on a  person   s garden, now, when I started, he raises a lot of things, but  combining crops   cucumbers, squash, watermelon, some cantaloupe     he said they was blooming, but the blooms was falling off, could I bring  some bees out? I took some bees out and within ten days, he was picking  cucumbers. He told me that they over-pollinated his watermelons that  year because I think he said he got, if I remember right, two thousand  little melons off of about a third of an acre. It   s a different blossom, I  think, produced the melon.  Goodness. Do you eat honey every day?  Just about every day. I use it on my cereal, whether it   s cooked or  prepared cereal, all the time. I use very, very little sugar. I couldn   t get  my wife to do a lot of baking with honey, but we did use quite a bit of  honey. Have you seen my creamed honey? The trade name on it is spun  honey, creamed honey, whipped honey    I just call mine honey spread.  It   s not mentioned on the label.  Displays a jar of creamed honey.   So how do you make   ?  How do you make that? You take honey and put some of this in as a  starter, kind of like yeast    I wish I had a label on one.  (Laughs) But that   s neat.  Just like yeast, you put some of that in as the starter and control the  temperature. The temperature is critical. They tell me the ideal  temperature is around 55, 57 degrees. Warmer than that, it won   t go.  Colder than that, it takes forever to set up.  And then it   s just a nice spread?  Yes. I keep that in the refrigerator. When I   m using it, it will be in my  36  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  cabinet. Just spread just like butter. Keep it in the refrigerator, it   s just  like butter. It   s hard and you can   t cut it. But if you put it up in the  cabinet that it softens up enough, you can spread it. What   s nice about  that is you can put it on your slice and it don   t run or drip.  Wow, that   s nice. Would you sell this at the farmer   s market?  I did when I had it. In fact, I got a big demand for that, I was surprised.  It   s kind of expensive, I think, but I think I was getting, that   s a pound  jar    Eight dollars, I believe.  How much would you sell a jar this size of just honey for?  I think last year I sold them for the same. This one should have been  higher, but a lady that was helping me, she said the price of everything  has gone up, so we went up on a lot of things and that one, I didn   t. A  one pound jar, I   d get eight dollars. A pint jar, which is twenty-three  ounces, I think, about a pound and a third, is nine dollars, and a quart is  fifteen. I was getting sixty dollars a gallon last year. They say it   s gone  up again, but it sounds unreasonable to me. If you count your time in at  all, you   re not making any money, but I like to do it.  I think people realize the health benefits of local honey as opposed to  buying it at the store.  I tell people that ask me to talk to me about it, it   s just like any  medication. Some, it will help a lot more than others. I   ve had customers  that had a son that had asthma real bad and they said they was taking  him to the doctor about twice a month. They   d buy honey that was  harvested in the spring and again in the fall. Before they left this part of  the country, they   d take him twice a year.  Wow, that   s amazing.  I   m kind of a believer in it myself because I used to have hay fever and  sinus problems, real bad. The last few years, I haven   t had sinus  problems and very little hay fever.  Well, to close out the interview, we usually like to ask when history is  written about you, how would you like to be remembered?  Well, that   s a good one. (Laughter) That   s a good one. I don   t know, I  was an engineer all my working career, but I   m better known as a  beekeeper.  What gave you the most satisfaction?  37  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Well, let me tell you a little story. My wife   s not here to defend herself.  When I started selling honey to the market, men would call me the bee  man and the women would call me the honey man. (Laughter) So you  can see why there   s a little conflict there.  I can.  But I don   t know.  What are some lessons and values you learned growing up out in  Western Oklahoma and through the Dust Bowl?  Honesty and integrity. In other words, when I grew up, a handshake was  as good as any contract you ever wrote. Honesty and integrity is two  subjects that I remember most. Growing up in the Dust Bowl era, we  helped each other, and it kind of bothers me at times about the way  people expect the government to take care of them, now. Back then, a  family got in trouble, ill, and couldn   t farm, the farmers jumped in and  plowed his field and planted his wheat for him. They didn   t ask for  outside help. I don   t see that a whole lot anymore. It   s always,    The  government owes me this,    or,    I can get it from the government.    I  think if we get back to helping each other, we   d have a lot less problems  than what we have now. It   s just a different society and a different world  now. I don   t know.  It sounds like you also learned to be innovative and creative.  Well, like I said, I had asthma growing up. These hands are really  important to me. For years, when I worked in one of the power plants, I  kept everybody   s watch in repair. New crystals, new pins, new winding  stems and if you need a balance wheel, I   d put those in, main spring     In other words, anything I can do. I kept all of our appliances repaired  until I got to where I couldn   t see. Dishwasher, stove, washing machine,  dryer, things like that, toaster     Wow, that really pays off.  Car repair, until it got too complicated. I overhauled one or two engines  in my time. Probably shouldn   t say this, but working in a power plant  with one of the plant managers I worked under, he says,    Eldon, we can  fix any mechanical problem, it   s the people problem we   ve got to look  out for.    That   s true. (Laughter) You get to where you can repair any  equipment that breaks, but people problems, they   re different.  Everybody is different. They can be handled different. I don   t know  what you   d say I   d be remembered    I know having a father and two  38  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  brothers in the service, I consider myself a loyal American. Family  values matter a whole lot to me, too.  And you   ve certainly been an educator with your bees.  To me, bees are like anyone else   s hobby. If you really dig into it,  there   s always something there to learn and fascinate you. Like I told  you earlier, I don   t have an ear for music. A lot of people enjoy music  and this. I won   t say I don   t enjoy it. The era that I grew up in, I can go  along with that, but this newer generation, I don   t understand the music.  But the bees make music. (Laughter)  You go out to one of my hives now and listen to them, they   re really  fanning today.  Oh, I bet.  They   re really fanning.  Well, should we take a look at your bees?  Sure.  Thank you for visiting with me. I sure appreciate it.  (Laughs) One thing I didn   t mention, we talked about rabbits one time.  We ate a lot of rabbits in the wintertime out there until the rabbit fever  came through and everybody quit using them. That   s when the rabbits  really died out. They called it rabbit fever. Boy, they just almost  disappeared. But we ate a lot of rabbits. We ate some quail. We ate just  what was available. I like potatoes almost cooked any way. Mashed  potatoes, potatoes and gravy    A lot of people say you shouldn   t eat  gravy. (Laughter) But of four grandparents, three of them lived to be in  their nineties and the fourth one was about probably eighty-five. My  father passed away at eighty-four and my mother passed away at ninety-two.  We   ve got long genes, I guess. My oldest brother passed away at  eighty-eight. My brother now just older than me is eighty-eight. I   ll soon  be eighty-six.  Pretty good genes, I   d say.  So far. Well, I don   t know, I still think the work ethic    We   re spoiled  now, with this air conditioning. Back in those days, you worked  regardless.  39  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Waugh  Wilson  Regardless of how hot it was?  Yes. Where we lived out in the northwest, higher altitude and a dryer  climate, when the sun goes down, it cools off out there a lot faster than it  does back here. My wife talked about, they   d take their bedding out and  lay it under a tree or out on the porch    We might do that once or twice  a year up there, but most of the time, the houses were built to where the  air flow would flow through the house. When the sun went down, things  cooled off and the breeze, we always had a breeze. Nearly always.  That helps a lot.  (Laughs) Yeah, the wind will be blowing pretty strong out here and  people will say,    Oh, that   s awful strong.    I say,    This is just a breeze.     Nothing compared to what it used to be.  No and still, a lot more wind out there than here because they   re putting  up all those wind generators out there.  I was just out there, in June I think. I went through Cheyenne and up to  Shattuck and I was amazed at how many wind generators are all over  the place. That   s just what the skyline is.  Yes. The company I worked for is involved in a lot of those. Here   s one  thing a lot of people don   t understand that the power company has to  have what we call a base load or a steam generator to back those up. If  the wind don   t blow, we   ve got to have electricity from somewhere. So  our capital investment, still, pretty great in what we call base load units.  When the wind generators run, then they have to back off these others.  So what do you think about wind generators?  Oh, I think they   re okay, but they   re not    In other words, they wanted  to build a plant up here at Sooner and they wouldn   t let them because  they wanted to build another coal unit up here. If we don   t build them  and maintain those, like I say, some day we   re going to have brown outs  and black outs if the wind don   t blow. Once they get those towers built,  that   s cheap electricity, but those towers are expensive.   Thanks again for talking with me.   -------  -------
