 Higgins  Simpson  Today is March 20, 2014. My name is Jason Higgins, and I am an intern  at the Oklahoma Oral Research Program at the OSU library. I   m in  Langston, Oklahoma to speak with James Simpson regarding his  experiences as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history project.  Mr. Simpson, I would like to thank you for joining me today.  Well, you   re welcome.  So, we   ll begin with, what   s your full name?  James Allen Simpson.  And when and where were you born?  I was born in Zanesville, Ohio on September 24, 1931.  Okay, so was that an urban environment or rural?  Yes. Zanesville is a small town in southeastern Ohio, fifty miles due east  to Columbus, on old Route 40. At the time it had about forty-five to fifty  thousand people. We lived right on the outskirts just west, but we were  in Zanesville, but I could walk a hundred yards and be in some pretty  deep woods.  What did your family do for a living?  (Laughs) That   s one of those questions you shouldn   t ask. They did what  they had to do. My father had a band, and he played at a nightclub six  nights a weeks. It was a nightclub, of course where blacks couldn   t go,  but he also pitched baseball. That was his early years. He had a radio  show out of Columbus, Ohio for a while, but he wouldn   t do it. Several  of his cousins were musicians. My father was a musician also or he  5  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  wouldn   t have had a band. And, they   d try to get him to leave and go to  New York with them, but he wouldn   t go because by then he had started  a family.  Okay.  I think he might have started a family before he wanted to, but he   d  started a family. My mother did not work. She worked all the time     thirteen children, but she did not work away from the home. She did one  time. Dad would go to work. I believe he was working for the city. I   m  not sure of that. While he was working for the city, he would leave at  seven or eight in the morning and get home at five. She took a job at  David Davies, which was a  meat  packing company. She would go over  there and clean up the offices while he was gone and get home before he  got home so he wouldn   t know she was working. He was from one of  those families where the women didn   t work.  Do you know much about your family history? Would you mind talking  about that at all?  I know a little bit about it. I don   t know. I was probably a lot closer to  my mother   s family than I was to my father   s family. Both lived right  there in Zanesville. My great-grandmother was a lady, we called her  Grandma Singer. I learned almost all of the edible weeds, plants,  because I guess she was, she was in her nineties, and she would come  and get me to go to the woods with her. We would pick everything:  dandelions, Shepherd   s Sprout, bear   s claw. You name it, we picked it. I  don   t think she ever knew my name. She always just called me Boy.  (Laughs) But that   s what I was. I was her boy. Grandma Singer was  born, probably in the early 1840s in Cutler, Ohio. Really, she was born  in an Indian village right outside of Cutler, down by Marietta, Ohio. And  then, Grandpa Singer was one of those run-away slaves, and as near as  they could figure, he crossed that Ohio River in 1854, got pneumonia.  They put him there in Marietta. Then they hid him out in Cutler, and  that   s where he met grandma. So that part of the family I know, because  I knew them pretty well. They both lived to be over a hundred, and I  used to talk to them.  Then, coming down, there was so many people in the family. It was one  of those situations where, right after that Civil War, so many of the men  did not come back. Some of my relatives   well let me put it like this:  they used to send me to carry food to Grandma Hobert. That   s my  grandfather   s name. She was Dutch so she would have on her wooden  shoes and so forth. And I would go. She would give those windmill  cookies. They were so hard you couldn   t eat them if you soaked them.  But, you know, so that part of the family, I knew pretty well because, as  6  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  I said, they were kind of close-knit. We all grew up together. Grandma  had three or four sisters, Aunt Grace, Aunt Rose, Aunt Edith. She had  three sisters. I never knew her brothers, Uncle John. I don   t even know  her other brother   s name but I did know those aunts because they were  all right there.  Did your grandmother ever pass down any stories to you?  No. No. I never talked to her.  I mean your great-grandmother.  I know. I never talked to her about anything like that. No. I only knew  about those stories because my mother loved history, and she knew. And  of course, she was close to them. My mother was the oldest of Grandma  Singer   s daughter, Eliza Jane. She used to get mad when I called her  that, but I would always call her that because I was her boy. I was the  oldest grandchild, and I could get away with anything because I was  Frances   s son. She was the oldest granddaughter, and they all loved  Frances. I could get away with anything. The other kids couldn   t, but I  could, you know?  And were you the oldest?  I was the oldest. Actually, I had a cousin who was   my mother   s  younger sister had a daughter, Jean. Jean was about six months older,  but Jean was independent. She was a non-entity. I hate to say it. I stayed  with them a lot. Mom had four brothers and one sister. It was her sister  who named me. And her brothers, I would go fishing with them,  hunting. I was a favorite son. And all the other grandkids, they seemed  to accept it, even when I see them now. They still accept that.    This is  Allen. He   s special.    And it makes you feel special, even though you  don   t have a thing. (Laughs) Nothing, but you feel like    I am a little  special.     So what was it like going to school?  School was different. My grade school was Munson Elementary School,  which was about eight or ten blocks from where we lived. The  neighborhood I lived in was turning over and that was in the thirties, and  it was about   well, the family next door was white, on the left, which  would have been west. The family on the east side was white. The  family right in the back of us was white. So, growing up, you know, we  had that type of relationship and yet, we all knew there was a difference.  And so, when I went to school, I used to get a little upset because there  was not a black teacher, not a janitor, nobody on the yard. I would get a  7  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  little upset as a kid.  And, by the second grade, I was in full rebellion because they would  read Little Black Sambo, and let me see   in the second grade Gladys  was gone   I was the only black in the class, and everybody would look  at me. And I would refuse to read, but I would wait until they had  something that was difficult to read, and I would try to volunteer, and  sometimes, I would be over-looked. But, I mentioned Little Black  Sambo, but there were some songs they used to sing. And I had   I  wouldn   t sing   you know,    Way down upon the Suwannee River.     There were some songs that had racial overtones.  And you felt that, as a young child?  Oh, yes I did. I don   t know when I started that feeling. I wouldn   t put oil  on my hair. I think I had the first afro. (Laughs) I must have been nine or  ten. Zanesville was an interesting city. National Geographic carried an  article on it because so many of the families there were mixed   black,  white. The part that was really difficult, for some of those families the  woman might have four or five kids, and they were white, and then she  would marry a black man and have some kids. Of course they are black.  There   s no such thing as part black. If you   re black, you   re black. So,  then those kids, of course, would be close, but some of them would run  with their crowd. Some of them couldn   t. So it was that kind of a  neighborhood, and it was that kind of a growing up. When you say some  of my best friends were white, they were, but my best friends   the  bunch I was with all the time   they were black. We went to a black  church there, right in our back yard. My grandfather was one of the  pastors. He was not the head pastor, but he was one of the pastors there.  Did you remain friends with those childhood friends?  By the time we were in high school, most of them had moved away from  that neighborhood. I don   t know if I remained friends with any of them  because, you know, proximity at that age is very important. I rarely saw  them anymore. Now the two little girls who lived next door, the Joneses,  we remained friendly. When we weren   t fighting, (laughs) we remained  friendly. But then, I left Zanesville when I was seventeen. I would come  back in the summer. Well, the first summer I did, but after that I haven   t  spent that much time in Zanesville but Zanesville is still home.  Did you graduate high school from Zanesville?  Yes, I graduated high school from there.  What year was that?  8  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  In 1949. I had to go back, probably about four weeks because while I  was in high school, I was working in a drugstore. I started working at a  drugstore there, downtown, when I was in the eighth grade, spring  semester of the eighth grade. I wasn   t old enough to get a work permit. I  guess they called it back then. They paid me cash, but I enjoyed that  because I always loved chemistry. One of the first gifts I got, in the  second grade, was a chemistry set. I had read an article about George  Washington Carver and that just intrigued me.  I don   t want to skip ahead too much, but did that influence your decision  to go to Tuskegee?  Oh, no. I never intended to go to college. College was never on my  radar. It didn   t influence it at all. Money influenced that. When I   well  no. That did not influence it.  So let   s talk about that then, the financial aspects.  I was working at the drugstore, and then one of mother   s brothers, Uncle  Roy, he was working at a department store downtown, about a block and  a half away, and one of the people working with him, he was a janitor,  got sick. They asked me could I fill in, and I said,    Yes.    They were  paying seventy-five cents an hour, forty-eight hours a week, six dollars a  day. Yeah, I could fill in. That filling in lasted from that spring of my  junior year until I graduated, which meant then that I was still working  at the drugstore. So I was working, sixteen and forty-eight (adds), I was  working sixty-four hours a week going to high school. I would go to  work at four at the drugstore, get off at six, and then go on to the  department store and work until two the next morning. By then, the  buses had stopped running. So I would have to get out, walk home  across the Y-Bridge, about a mile and a quarter. And in Ohio, in  January, sometimes that can get to be  rough . (Laughs) Okay, so I  would get home about two-thirty, and then I   d get up the next morning  and go to school. But I went on my time. (Laughs) I didn   t go on their  time.  I had a buddy who was two years ahead of me. He had finished high  school. He was working at a loading dock down there at the railroad,  Second Street, Second and Main. I   d usually stop there and get some  fruit, banana, whatever they were unloading from the railroad cars that  day, commodities. Then I would go on because I had a chemistry  class   this was my senior year   I had a chemistry class that I wouldn   t  miss no matter what. So then I had to go by the vice-principal   s office,  Dean of Men, and I   d get a slip, which would let me go. And I went in  there one morning to get my slip and they wouldn   t give it to me. So, I  9  raised some sand, but they told me,    Not until Mr. Buxton comes out  and talks to you.    He came out and said,    Allen, there   s no problem. I  want you to take this test.    Then he gave me a test. I sat down there and  took the test. It was multiple choice, 100 questions   I don   t  remember   that   s how much of an impression it made on me. I gave  them the test. They gave me my slip and that was the end of it. I never  thought of that test again.  In August   no, it was the middle of September   well, I was saying that  I had to go about a month after school was out because every time I was  late then they would give me an additional day that I   d have to   you  know, tardy. So when I graduated, I didn   t get my diploma because I had  all that bad time. So then I had to go during the day and make up all that  bad time. In the meantime, I had been trying to play football. Obviously,  I had to give that up, but I wasn   t going to. We played the Big Blue,  September   I think it was the twenty-fourth because it was my birthday.  That   s when I was diagnosed   but nevertheless, I got in the game and  scored a touchdown. Not that I was a star player or anything but, in  overtime, really because on a defensive penalty, we had managed to  score. They had been state champs the year before so the next morning it  was all headlined, but not for me because I was sick. They took me to  the hospital and diagnosed me with peptic ulcers. That was sort of the  end of my football career. I was passing blood from every orifice in my  body. I won   t go into any details, but yeah, I was sick. I laid around for a  day or two, and I went on back to my work schedule, went back to  school.  I finished up  high school  and I was trying to decide what to do because  the job that I had been taking at Webber   s Department Store had played  out. The guy did come back, so now I   m finished. I   ve got to get me a  full-time job. I can   t work part-time. My big idea was to get that job  running the elevator at the bank, because you went in in a white shirt and  a tie, and you didn   t have to go out in the snow, in the rain. But all  through high school I had terrible grades, terrible, deplorable. But they  would give us these exams. I don   t know if that was common to  Zanesville, the state of Ohio, or nationwide. I would always go the next  year, and they would have me in all these advanced courses, college  prep, AP   I don   t think they called them that then but they would have a  certain group.  In my graduating class there were about 365. Okay, so I would say in  my sophomore  year  there were 400-500, because students dropped out  then. They would put me in all these advanced courses. They never told  me why because my grades, just as I said, they were horrible, but I  would always score high on the tests. I just didn   t do any homework. I  didn   t carry any homework. I just didn   t. I was busy. When I wasn   t  10  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  working at the drugstore, I was cleaning out basements. Everybody had  coal furnaces. Nobody liked to get those ashes in buckets and carry them  up the steps so you could always make a hustle doing that. You know,  just a hustle.  Homework didn   t pay much, did it?  No, it didn   t pay anything. You didn   t have to have a lot. Hamburger  was like three pounds for a quarter. If you made a quarter, you could  pretty well feed the family. It was a meatloaf, you know what I mean?  So no, it didn   t pay much, didn   t pay much, but I did find out one thing  early. I didn   t like to work by the hour. I liked to work by the job. I liked  to come in and say,    I   ll do that for fifty cents.    Because, see they  thought anytime you made more than a quarter an hour that you were  overpaid. But I wouldn   t work two hours for fifty cents. I would carry all  those ashes out for fifty cents.  So you were a young entrepreneur.  Sort of, sort of, yeah, between the woods, selling greens, berries, and  asparagus. I had found an asparagus patch up there in the woods, and I  had to go harvest it whether the people wanted it or not because if you  didn   t it would grow up, turn to seeds, get woody. So I used to have to  go up there   didn   t have to   but kept it cut so I could always make a  dime or so with asparagus. And a dime sounds like nothing to you folks,  but that was a loaf of bread, a pound of bologna, you know. I was, to a  degree, an entrepreneur, to a degree. I never had a desire to go into  business.  But I was talking about that test, and I was going to cross the Y-Bridge,  and people were hollering out the window of a bus,    Going to college,  going to college,    calling me by my nickname. I   m not going to say it,  but I thought,    What   s the matter with these crazy people?    I got home,  Hudson street, and my mother, my uncles   those uncles that I talked  about, Uncle Roy at the department store and Uncle Harry at the  drugstore   they were all out there in the street, singing and praying.  They were having a good time. I said,    What   s going on?    They said,     You   re going to college.       I   m not going to any college. I never applied  for any college.    It had come out in the Pittsburgh Courier. It was a  black paper. It had come out that the three highest students in the state of  Ohio had been given full tuition scholarships. I said,    What   s that got to  do with me?       It   s your name     That test they had made me take to get  my  slip . It was a standardized test apparently, and they had given it all  over Ohio, and I had scored high.  Now, if I would   ve had any sense at all, if I had known anything about  11  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  college, I would not have accepted it because all it paid was tuition. But  when they say a full tuition scholarship, my folks   that   s how they  knew about college. You got a scholarship. And it amounted to what  thirty-six, thirty-seven dollars a semester at that time. Didn   t include  room, board, books, nothing. So, they carried on.  They packed boxes. Uncle Bill   s wife   s sister was married to a guy who  taught at Wilberforce. So they called and they said,    Well, he hasn   t  applied but if he   s got that scholarship. Tell him to come on.    So I went  to college, but under protest (laughs) under protest. I told   I called my  boss. I was working for a guy named Rankin, who was a big booster,  when we were playing football. So I had been working for him. He had  just opened a new insurance firm but my mother had worked for him,  and his oldest son was Allen. I think that   s where the Allen had come  from, even though it was my auntie who   d given me that name.    I need  to take off a week.    He said,    Take off a week, for what?    I said,    Well,  Mom wants me to go to college.    (Laughs) He said,    You   re going to  college for a week?    I said,    At the most     (Laughs) I might be back  before then but, you know, I   m going to keep Mom happy. So as I said,  that is how I went to college, and I was in college two days, three at the  absolute most. I felt like one of those Baptist preachers. I got the call.     This is where I   m going to be the rest of my life      My first black teacher, ironically, was from Muskogee, Oklahoma,  Sammie Sadler. And her father had written the song, the school song at  Langston. Of course, I didn   t know anything about Langston. But that  was my first black teacher, was freshmen English. That was the first  black teacher I ever had.  So did you enjoy the readings in that class more than your  grade school  English classes ?  She was a good-looking, well-built   and I was seventeen, turned  eighteen, then. (Laughs)  You weren   t too worried about the readings?  (Laughs) Right, but I did well in her class, considering my transcript. It  was interesting. Back way before your time  Jason    you may  remember  Tanya    we had typewriters. And the typewriters had a red  ribbon on it, which had a red and a black so that you could hit a button  and type in red or hit a button and type in black. Before the computer.  Nevertheless, I was an unusual student. I   m there on scholarship, but I   m  also there on academic probation. (Laughs) This was before they got  into all that privacy thing so my name was posted that I was one of the  scholarship recipients but I was also on academic probation because my  12  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  grades from high school (scuffs). I might have 340 out of the 365. There  might have been fifteen people or twenty-five people, I guess, lower  than me.  Well, it seems that you changed your perception of school during that  time, in your college years.  I just fell in love. Well, I had found out in high school, and even before,  that I loved anything that had to do with the physical sciences or math. I  liked it because there was no, don   t want to say interpretation, you were  right or you were wrong. As in other classes, for example, I know when  I was in the fifth grade, there was a teacher, who shall remain nameless,  but nevertheless, they were talking about numbers and how big those  numbers were and so forth. She mentioned something about a billion  being the biggest number or something, and I asked how long it would  take to count to a billion. She said,    You couldn   t count to a billion in  your lifetime.    I said,    That doesn   t sound right to me. You couldn   t  count to a billion?     So I spent the rest of that day, there in the fifth grade, and I counted to a  hundred. They had the electric clock on the wall, and I timed that. I  could divide. We had learned long division and multiplication in the  third grade. But then I said,    Well, it would take longer when you got  into big numbers where you had to say nine-hundred and ninety million,  nine hundred,    you know. So I did it that way, counted to a hundred,  averaged those two and figured how much longer it would take me. And  it was a long period of time. She, I think, had just given up on me. She  had just given up on me because I was contrary. I   m going to say it like  that.  You thought critically.  Well, yes, but sometimes they would say things, and I was left out. By  now there was another black kid in my class, in the fifth grade. It was a  girl named Ethel Williams from Monessen, Pennsylvania. But anyway, I  guess toward the end of the day, or it might have been the next day, I  called her name and said,    You could count to a billion. And it would  take    ,    and I told her how many hours and minutes it would take,  because I had figured that out. I probably was wrong, didn   t have a  calculator, just paper. She was upset and    I said you couldn   t.    I said,     You can.    She sent me to the principal   s office. The principal said,     What is this?    I told her. I liked the principal. She was strict. She would  whip you. She gave me my first whipping in the first grade. (Laughs)  She knew my mother, and so I think she liked my mother. My mother  had graduated from Zanesville High School. She   d been born in Athens,  down at Ohio University, because they had the two mills down there.  13  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  So, the college that you went to, your undergraduate, was that  integrated?  Yes, very mildly. (Laughs)  Very mildly?  Very mildly.  Could you discuss that a little bit?  Wilberforce was, of course, one of the oldest black schools, and then  about four or five years before I went there   and I should know the  exact date, but I don   t. There was a church   a Methodist church had  mortgaged some of their property to build a new dorm, Faith Hall. Well,  the church didn   t come through, and they had a big hole in the ground, a  basement and so forth. I guess the contractors decided not to finish.  Okay. So then whoever was holding that note, they came in to takeover.  They say,    No, you can   t take this.    They said,    This property belongs  to, I   m going to say the state,    I don   t know who it belonged to.    You  just got some bad papers.    So what the state of Ohio did was they came  in, and they took about half of Wilberforce. I could name the dorms, but  it doesn   t make any difference. They took about half of it. Wilberforce  was left with the older buildings. So now there are two schools there,  Wilberforce University and you crossed the street to Wilberforce State  University.  I was supposed to be going Wilberforce University. I didn   t know. I  didn   t know anything about this. It was United Negro College Fund that  was giving my scholarship, and they don   t give to state schools. So I was  at the wrong school. Nevertheless, I was at Wilberforce State. The next  year, we had an election. We came up with all kinds of names,  Banneker. We had all the names of the black folks, Frederick Douglass.  The president of the school, Dr. Wesley, decided we would call it  Central State University so that was sort of the history. You got one  group over here, that   s Wilberforce, and we were Wilberforce State then  Central State. Central State had several white students, not a lot, several,  probably didn   t have more than 600 students. I would say there might  have been at the most four or five white students, at the most. Of course,  as time went on it became, you know,  more integrated  but at that time,  that was it.  Did you ever talk or communicate with those white students?  Oh yes.  14  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Did you become friends?  Yes, but they didn   t live in the dorms, and that makes a difference. They  did not live in the dorms. I became friends with them. One of them put  me through it. They had a play, and I wasn   t going to be in the play. I  was in chemistry so I wasn   t thinking about the play, because I did  major in chemistry when I got there. They asked for a major. I didn   t  know psychology. My mother liked history. So they asked what I liked. I  said,    Well, I like chemistry. I   m better at that than most people, much  better than most people.    In high school, we had had a lot of Jewish  kids, quite a few German-Jews. They were refuges who had escaped and  got over. One of them was one of my better buddies. I don   t mean we  ran together because I didn   t run with anybody. I went to work at four  and got off at two the next morning, and that was six days a week so I  didn   t run with anybody.  Do you recall his name?  Buddy Lind. Very, very bright. Of course, they considered him to be the  brightest thing going. Herby Cosack, quite a few, Rita Adams, Jackie  Dietrich. I had known some of those kids at Munson but we had three  different junior high schools. They had gone to Grover Cleveland. I went  to Roosevelt because that   s where the blacks went. I found out that I  could beat all of those kids. They were the top honors students, and they  wouldn   t listen to my reports in chemistry. We   d do lab work, and then  you had to go to one of the lab assistants and explain what you had done.  They had told Mr. Roe, and I had always felt guilty about that, because  he had written to me several times and I didn   t answer his letters, but  they told him,    We can   t listen to Allen. We don   t know what he   s  talking about.    (Laughs)  I remember the first time that happened. The pH meter was showing,  I   m going to say, I   m just going to throw out a number, seven point six.  Your calculations would   ve said seven point five. So they said,    The pH  meter could be off that much.    I said,    Or, your theory.    I had been  reading when I was working at that department store and way before  that. I could work any problem in any college general chemistry book,  even though I was making all Ds and Fs. Because I loved them, I could  work those problems. So I explained to them about Arrhenius, and how  those numbers they were using depended upon infinite dilution. If you   re  not at infinite dilution, then those things are not 100 percent  independent. I had done that on a number of things, on the gas laws. So  they wouldn   t listen to me. They said,    No, you   ve got to listen to him.     So he and I would get together and talk.  15  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Was that gentleman a role model of yours or was he more of a  mediator?  Not really. No.  So did you have any role models at your undergraduate university?  At undergrad, yes. I didn   t really have a role model.  A mentor?  I had a guy who was chairman of the department, Dr. Woolfolk. He  wasn   t German, may sound like it but he wasn   t. I had an interesting  thing. I was on academic probation, as I said. I think there was thirty-two  chemistry majors in that freshmen class. They had recruited and it  was a new school. They had a little lady there that everybody was afraid  of because she was teaching the general chem class. It was her first year  teaching there. She had been teaching at another major university. Her  husband had just gotten out of the Army, been accepted to medical  school, and she was teaching organic chemistry. He had to take organic  chemistry, pass it, and then he   d get into medical school. She failed him.  He didn   t get into med school, and he left her. (Laughs) She left  Washington D. C. It was at Howard. So that was my general chem  teacher, and she was, she thought, tough but she gave out twenty-eight  Fs, three Cs, and an A. I got the A, and you can imagine how that swept  across the campus. Little old small campus, everybody knew  everybody   s business. So, you know, what they were saying,    That little  yellow-eyed, big-headed boy,    that type of thing.  She didn   t become a mentor because she was gone the next year. They  got rid of her. She was probably a little too tough. I loved her. I loved  her. Then the lady who I liked was the lady who taught me analytical  chemistry. Her name was Leila Cochran Green. She had been holding  down that job because her husband was finishing his PhD at Ohio State.  She was holding that down for him, but she was brilliant, a brilliant  woman. Her hobby was correcting Latin slogans on advertisements. It  used to be that a lot of people had Latin phrases, and she would correct  the syntax, grammar. I loved her. I really did. And she liked me.  (Laughs) She and I would just fight all the time. We   d just fight all the  time, but I didn   t really have a role model. The chairman of department  was a guy named Woolfolk, and he had decided that I was his boy, I  guess.  Highly intelligent.  Well no, not that I was so intelligent but I could do chemistry. I wasn   t  16  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  that good a student. I didn   t fail anything. I had a student named John  Maxwell who reminded me of myself, somewhat. He   s dead now. In  Tulsa. His high school chemistry teacher brought him out, and his high  school chemistry teacher happened to have been my brother-in-law. The  wife had been dead for years, way before I met him. He told me,    This is  a boy who   s good,    and he was. He was good  You might say make an  A in chemistry and calculus, but an F in everything else.  So you graduated with your bachelor   s in science, chemistry?  Yes.  And did you go to    the Army afterwards?   Well, when I graduated I was in ROTC so I planned to go to the Army,  at regular rank, commissioned. I was   what did they call it then? There  were about two or three of us, and we got our degrees, and we were  distinguished military graduates. That probably is not the right term. We  got regular Army commissions. Everybody else in ROTC got reserve  commissions.  What year was that?  In 1953.  Right at the end of the Korean War.  Yes, right at the end of the Korean War. The Korean War was over  about two weeks after I graduated. I think I graduated on June 10, and I  think that Korean War was over, might have been over weeks before,  but it was within that narrow of a range.  Did you go to officer training school?  When I finished, I had not applied to any graduate schools, and then my  major professor and I had kind of fallen out. He wanted me to be all  chemistry, and I got involved in a fraternity. I was president of my  fraternity.  Which one?  Alpha Phi Alpha. I was president of our chapter. It was a new chapter. I  was president   no, not president, I was secretary of the officers    club.  Henry Thomas was president. I had just gotten involved in a lot of  things. I talked about that white girl that I had gotten to know. The guy  who was over the Theatre Arts program had recruited me to play the  17  Higgins  Simpson  young chemist in Black No More. And just a lot of things that I had  gotten in and he did not like that. I was with the Scientific Society, Beta  Kappa Chi, the American Chemical Society, juniors. I was the president  and we would go over to Antioch and meet with them.  Then my spring semester my senior year, he and the chairman of the  biology department and another guy who was in the biology department,  Craft, and myself, we toured the south and went to Prairie View to give  some papers. So we went from Ohio to Tennessee, Beale Street, and  then on over. His father had been a Methodist minister. We went by, I  can   t think of where Mississippi Valley is located now, then on over to  Louisiana to Prairie View and so forth.  I had not applied to grad school so I went ahead and applied, University  of Kansas. There was with this girl with me, and she was not my  girlfriend. She may have wanted to be but we were just buddies. I didn   t  realize until later but nevertheless, sweet as she could be. She could give  you one inch purple crystals, if that   s what you wanted. She was good in  the lab.  Hindsight is twenty-twenty.  (Laughs) She was good. She was good. The girl I married was very  good. She graduated from Langston, almost a straight A average,  Lynne   s mother. The University of Kansas gave me a scholarship,  twelve hundred dollars. Put me on the waiting list because I was so late  applying, and they said I would probably get it because they would give  out the scholarships, and some people take two and three. Then when  it   s time to enroll, they would choose, and so, they usually then have  polite refusals. So I   d probably get one, twelve hundred dollars a year.  Doesn   t sound like anything to you folks. So then Woolfolk, he called  Tuskegee and told them,    We got a good one here we would like you to  look at. How much would you offer?    They said,    We   ll give him  eighteen hundred a year.    There was nothing to consider, eighteen  hundred. That was a lot of money to me.  They tried to get me to go into   they were starting a program at Ohio  State where you could go to your undergrad school   Wilberforce in my  particular case, Central State   and then you would take courses there in  the medical school. It was like a six or seven year program. When you  finish, you get your MD and your bachelor   s degree, and they were  going to pay the fees. All I had to come up with was room and board. By  then I was pretty sophisticated but it also meant I would have to give up  all my other activities. And I wasn   t about to give those up, plus the fact  that I didn   t expect to get a dollar a month from home. Anything I had  came from my old hustle.  18  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  So you went to Tuskegee for financial reasons?  Beg your pardon?  You went to Tuskegee for financial reasons?  That   s the reason I said it wasn   t so much Carver, as it was the eighteen  hundred dollars. (Laughs)  Right, Right.  It was in the Carver Foundation, which was ironic because that was  probably my first inspiration. I liked Tuskegee. I loved it. I really think I  treated college   not like a vacation. I was serious about my studies but I  had worked so hard through junior high, high school that when I got to  college, and they were talking about working thirty-six hours a week for  room and board. I can do that standing on my head. You know what I  mean? (Laughs) And still have time to do everything else, play cards.  Just do it all.  So what was the biggest difference between the campus at Tuskegee and  Central State, do you think?  If I had to put my finger on a real difference, it would be difficult. Kids  at Central State were mostly, not entirely   Ohio, of course, had the  biggest group. Had about fifty kids from Oklahoma there. That was the  biggest club on the campus, was the Oklahoma Club. So many of those  people had gone to Wilberforce. The guy who was principal at the black  school, superintendent, the whole ball of wax, in Stillwater, he was a  Wilberforce graduate, and on and on. But what would be the biggest  difference? It would probably be whatever the difference is between  black folks from New York City and Montgomery, Alabama. It was just  different, and I   m not saying better or worse. There   s a difference, a  subtle difference.  So what about outside of the campus, what was that like?  I didn   t go outside that much.  Well, I know that the Montgomery bus boycotts was in    55, so you were  in Alabama during that time.  I was in Georgia. I was at Fort Benning, Georgia. I had gone into the  military, and I didn   t even know about it. It started in December. I was  finishing up that program that they put you through once you get your  19  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  commission. Then I had got my papers to go to Korea. So by the time  they really got to rolling on that bus boycott, I was in Korea.  So did you graduate with your master   s before you went to Korea?  Yes.  How long did it take you?  Two years. Two years. Would   ve taken longer if they would   ve given  me the money. I was having a good time, but anyways, two years.  What did you guys do on campus to relax?  Oh gracious. Well, there   s always what twenty-two and twenty-three  year old males do.  Right. Right.  (Laughs) Chase the girls. I had a couple of buddies. I had one buddy  from Xavier in New Orleans. We   d play tennis, probably every day, no  matter what the temperature was. Played intramural basketball. We   d  play cards. There was a club   did they call that club Twenty-nine? We  used to go over there, drink beer because they would have all those guys  come through who became famous later on, all came through that club.  We   d go over there. It was just a big barn with a bunch of tables, a lot of  beer. Everybody would go over there.  We were in the student affiliates of the American Chemical Society.  We   d go over there   I don   t know whether it was Auburn or the  University of Alabama   but we stayed together, because at that time, of  course, Wallace hadn   t made his famous    Segregation Forever     statement. We would stay together. We   d go to the American Chemical  Society meetings.  Can you recall any incidents that ever happened?  No, had no incidents. No. No. We deliberately avoided them. I didn   t  deliberately avoid them.  But the group did?  Yes. We were travelling with our professors at Tuskegee. Some of them  were pretty bitter. They wouldn   t let them vote. They PhDs from  University of Toronto, Iowa, and so forth, but they couldn   t pass the  literacy test to vote.  20  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  And that was still part of the grandfather clause during that time.  Yes, but yes, they couldn   t vote. They would fail the literacy test. So I  didn   t have any real desire to stay in that area. I didn   t have any real  desire to stay in that area. I don   t think I was bitter. I had been reared in  Ohio, which had the reputation for being liberal. By the time, as I said, I  was eight or ten years old I realized,    This is a sham. It   s not liberal. It   s  just as segregated.    I found out that it wasn   t as segregated as the south  but it was segregated. You couldn   t get a soda at   I won   t call the name  of the restaurant. I don   t want to be sued incase this should ever be put  out   but you couldn   t get a soda there. We would go to play football in  Columbus, and they would want the black players to eat on the bus. Just  things like that so I knew Ohio was no   I was an exchange student at  Oberlin, and I think of all the places that I was in at Ohio, that I liked  Oberlin better than any place I had ever been. It had that reputation, and  there was an atmosphere that was good. I was an exchange student at  Oberlin just a month. And then I liked Antioch. Antioch was just four or  five miles from where I was. These may be schools you   re not familiar  with.  No, I   m not.  Oberlin.  I   ve heard of Oberlin.  Antioch. That   s where Coretta Scott King went.  Did you have any classes with or professors who were historically  significant at Tuskegee?  No.  Okay, so I guess we could start talking about your military service. Did  you join the Army for financial reasons?  Okay. When I went to school, every male was in ROTC at that school. If  you were above a certain age or had something physically wrong, you  could get out of it, but you had to work to get out of it. I never tried. So,  I was in ROTC. That   s what you did. (Laughs). So I did those two years,  but then, once you got out of ROTC, there was a good chance you would  be drafted. Well, I thought I was pretty safe there. My roommate was a  guy studying religion. I was in chemistry so I thought I   d be pretty safe  there. I had no desire to go to Korea and fight for my country.  21  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  I didn   t object to fighting for my country, but we got there as freshmen  in    49. The war was really just getting started. We saw that group of  guys, maybe twenty-five or thirty of them, get their bars. They were  second lieutenants in the Army. One of them went on to become a  general. They graduated in June, and by the time we got back there in  September about eight or ten of them   and they were the top students in  that school, captain of the basketball team   they were dead, killed in  Korea. I had no desire for that. I mean I might   ve been a bit of a rebel  but I wasn   t that much of a rebel. So I had no desire to go there. I said,     I   m going to ride this ROTC thing.     So, then at the end of my sophomore year, we had to take a test, took the  test, got into advanced ROTC. And then did the advanced ROTC, you  got the ninety cents a day, twenty-seven dollars one month. So I did the  ROTC. That was my military career. That   s how I got in the military,  not that I was interested in the military, not at all, but I was not draft-dodging.  All of us were staying away from that.  That was pretty much unheard of during that time, to dodge the draft,  right?  Yeah.  Well, it was frowned upon.  There were some people who were doing it. They would fake illnesses.  They would find things.  It never crossed your mind?  I always laughed at my father. My father pitched semi-pro baseball. He  pitched against all of those teams and players you   ve heard of. My  uncles couldn   t   bad feet, overweight, the whole thing   Mom   s  brothers. They all went to the Army. They declared my dad 4F because  he had, I don   t know, something. He was so much better physically, able  to have gone. So, no. I just didn   t have any desire to go into the Army,  and yet, when I finished high school, that was my intention. The Korean  War just started then, in    49, so I was planning on going.  So you were an occupation force.  When I went.  What years were those?  It was    55 to    57.  22  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  What was it like going to Korea coming from   you were just out of the  south right?  Just out of the south.  And you went to South Korea. What was that like?  No problem.  No Problem?  No problem at all. I didn   t see anything. When we went to Korea, they  had 205 to 212 officers in a company. That   s when we were going  through our advanced basic training. Advanced basic   but anyways, we  were going through our training there.  Oxymoron. (Laughs)  Yes, it is. (Laughs) I had signed up to go to Aberdeen. Some of them  had signed up to go there. My second choice was Ethiopia because I had  always been fascinated by the history and so on. And all of them had  signed up for different tours, Germany. I think when it got through, 195  of the 205 of us were sent to Korea. (Laughs) So when we got to Korea,  young second lieutenants, we ran everything over there because the next  company, a week behind us, they did the same thing with them, which  meant that every PX officer, every little detail   I won   t say what kind     in Korea, was somebody from one of those two companies. We had  those barracks where you had like an H, where you had a common  dining room so we all knew  each other . So, I didn   t have any trouble in  Korea.  Were these integrated units?  Yes.  So the men under your command, they were integrated as well?  Yes, oh yes.  How would they react during that time?  I had no trouble at all.  No trouble.  23  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  No trouble at all. My sergeants were black. Most of my sergeants were  black, and they were career officers. But there was a little guy who had  been up and down, make sergeant, bust him, make corporal and they   d  bust him. A little red-headed guy and he was a wizard with the gun. He  could take it apart blindfolded and put it back together. The piece, I  guess we called it back then. His name was Smith. I asked to work with  Sergeant Smith. I liked him. We were about the same age. I had done  two years at Tuskegee so I was a little older than most of the second  lieutenants. I was twenty-three. Most of them were twenty-two. A little  older. Smitty was good. We were getting ready to have demonstrations  at regiment. I took Smitty up. He won the competition, got some  commendations and so forth.  For taking apart the gun?  Among other things.  Was that the M1 carbine?  The M1, not the carbine. Just the M1. I liked the carbine because it was  light, and you could throw out a lot of rounds in a hurry when I was  investigating ammunition dumps and so forth. They were always trying  to steal, and they would try to bushwhack you.  They, the South Koreans?  They would try and bushwhack you.  What does bushwhack mean?  Well, you go up there and investigate to see if your guards are awake or  if they have some girls, if they   re protecting the ammunition dump. You  had some people who were trying to steal. They would hide in the brush  and so forth and take shots at you. I always kept a banana clip in my  carbine because I   d carry the 45, but I liked the carbine because it was  light and you could throw out sixty rounds just like that.  In one clip?  Well, thirty in one banana clip, but I liked that. Not that I intended to  hurt anybody but I didn   t want to be hurt either.  So, what were the living conditions like?  We were living in a tent.  24  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  What about the civilians, the South Koreans?  There weren   t any civilians other than the Koreans.  Right. Right. The Koreans.  They had what you see on television, typical   I hate to call them a hut.  It was their house. I was fascinated. They used every square foot. They  might have cucumbers growing on their roof, dangling down. They used  their space. They used their space. I found most of them to be   well,  they   re standoffish, very standoffish, until they get to know you then  they were just people. That   s been my experience at almost every place  I   ve been. On a one-on-one basis, whether on an airplane, or wherever,  on a one-on-one basis, people are just people. When they get with their  group, then they have to assume the identity and the manners of the  group. But if it   s just one-on-one, I found most people to be that way. I  enjoyed Korea as much as you could enjoy it. It was a tour of duty. I  wasn   t going to fight it. Might as well enjoy it.  Was there ever any combat incident at all?  No. We had some but it had more to do with what we called the    slicky  boys    trying to break into our ammo dump, trying to steal, but not what I  would call combat. No, not what I would call combat.  Is there anything that stands out in your memory of South Korea the  most, good or bad?  Well, the thing that I remember after about   I had been there about ten  months, maybe less than that   I had carried some of my troops up to  compete in the regimental or battalion competitions. They had done very  well, and I got some commendations. And then, I got orders to report to  the United Nations so my last part of my tour, it was just an eighteen  month tour, I spent with the United Nations in Panmunjom, over the  truce teams. Well, obviously I was not over the truce teams. I was over  the guards who were guarding.  Where was that?  Panmunjom.  That   s in South Korea?  That   s in South Korea. Actually it   s right on the border. You   ve heard of  the 38th parallel?  25  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  I have.  Okay, where the truce teams meet. The Swiss and the Swedes are at  Panmunjom. There   s a five-mile stretch right across the Imjin River.  You   re talking about sixty years now. You   re depending upon a memory  that   s getting a little faded, but just across the Imjin River, there   s a five-mile  stretch where neither the North nor South Koreans, the Chinese, the  Americans, anybody else, can go in, except the truce teams. The Swiss  and the Swedes, they had a compound in there. They were with the  United Nations. They were the truce teams, and we were very close to  the Swiss. I wasn   t ever that close to the Swedes. The Swiss, they were  party boys, having a good time. (Laughs) But when they wanted to come  out of the demilitarized zone, the DMZ, then I would take   there were  about four of us   I turned out to be the ranking lieutenant because of  that two-year span. I got my commission then spent two years getting a  master   s so most of the second lieutenants I was with, I had date of rank  on them. In the Army, that   s big. It means you   re the boss.  Right. (Laughs)  Are you Army? Have you done any Reserve duty?  I am not, but I know a lot of people who were.  I had date of rank, so I was senior. But we   d go up there and get the  Swiss, and the Swedes but mostly Swiss, as I said because they always  wanted to go party. They were always looking for a party. They were  always inviting you up. I never heard of fondue until I got to running  with the Swiss. They had more wine and cheese. They   d bubble it. Then  they   d like to go out and urinate on North Korea, off their back porch.  (Laughs) They were just crazy, a lot of fun. They were a lot of fun.  What were your orders? There were obviously Cold War tensions during  that time. Could you describe that feeling?  A little bit. I   m a laid back person so tension didn   t get to me as much as  it might some people. Not that I   m better or worse. I   m just, you know.  Was there a general fear of nuclear threat during that time?  No, we would stand out there   I think there were about sixty of us in  my group. This was just below the DMZ. We had a camp. We built an  officers    club. We   d play cards. And when we had to, we   d go and  would bring them out. We guarded the entrance to the DMZ. Sometimes  you would sit out there, and you could see them massing over there on  the hill six, seven miles away   about from here across the Cimarron  26  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  River. They would have their maneuvers. You would look up and see  50,000 Red Chinese, North Koreans, blowing their bugles and coming  down that hill at an all-out charge. Well if they crossed that line, we  really didn   t have an evacuation plan. It was sort of like a U. They  would be behind us, so we really didn   t have an evacuation plan.  It was all training exercises?  It was all training exercises. We always hoped that it would be. (Laughs)  Because if it were not, then we would be   so did I have some  apprehension? Okay, it   s time now to stop. It   s time to stop and call  everybody together and critique your charge and so forth. But you   d  always see that.  I   ve heard a lot of stories about the bugle charges during the war.  That   s what they were doing.  Did that give you any frightened sense of danger?  Well, as I said, most of the troops were back on the south side of the  river, the Imjin. We were up there right next to the demilitarized zone, a  small group of us, about four second lieutenants. When I got there, there  were a couple of majors and some captains, but they had all rotated out.  And so we were there. Were there any captains? I don   t think there were  any, anybody up there above the level of second or first lieutenant by  then. They had all rotated out so we were up there by ourselves. We just  sat there and watched, you know. If they cross   if this is not a  maneuver   Okay.  Snafu.  You got your Jeep there. I had some grenades on top of our file cabinets  and so forth. Everybody knew what they were supposed to do. That was  one of the first jobs they gave me when I got there was to write up an  evacuation procedure, destroying the property and so forth. Then they all  rotated out, all those captains, majors   one was a major. They were  from VMI  Virginia Military Institute . They were all southern, and they  really weren   t used to  working with blacks . They had spent their entire  careers not working with black officers, not really working with black  troops. So, was I ever afraid? I don   t think so. I don   t think so. I never  felt that way.  So you guys were more concerned with the troops in front of you than  the possibility of a nuclear war.  27  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  I was never worried about a nuclear war. No.  Did you guys ever receive any nuclear training though?  Yes, we did.  What was that like?  It was nothing. Yes. We had   what did they call it   CBR (chemical,  biological, radiological). Myself and there was a guy named Lenny  Segal from New York, a second lieutenant also. Lenny and I both had  master   s degrees in chemistry. He had his from City College in New  York. I had mine from Tuskegee. So they sent down papers for Lenny  and I, and some others from the battalion, to go up to CBR school. We  got up to CBR school, and it was great. Give us a week off. We   d drink.  Play some cards, whatever. We got up there and they had what they  always have in the Army, a couple of second lieutenants teaching the  course. And they   re up there arguing about what is a proton. They had  just gotten the assignment, and they were up there teaching. So then  Lenny and I would take over the class, and we would teach the class for  them.  And of course, you knew more than the teacher again. (Laughs)  Oh my goodness, yes  (Laughs) But I had been put in that same position.  We knew so much more than they did but when they would teach CBR  (chemical, biological, radiological) warfare, they were talking about  half-lives, and they didn   t know what they were talking about.  Were you ever recruited to work on special projects like that   that you  are at liberty to discuss?  Yes. Yes. Yes, I was. I got, just before I went to the United Nations, I  got an order to report to some hillside there in Korea, and it was an  engineering group. They were going to take this mountain, level it,  terrace it, put rocks down it and so forth, and then put Quonsets all  around there. They were going to move a battalion or something in  there. I was the officer in charge of engineering. I said,    What?     (Laughs) So you go get the manual, and you read it, but I also went and  got one of the guys. I said,    Take me up to engineering.    That was that  weekend. So I go up there and find out who   s the top sergeant up there,  who   s going to be there that Monday morning. I went and found him. He  was at the DNCO Club (Duty Non-Commissioned Officer). I couldn   t  go in, but he came out, and we talked, and talked, and talked. Turned out  he was a black guy. I said,    Man, they had put me  in charge of  engineering .    (Laughs) He said,    Well just don   t get in the way. We   ll  28  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  make you look good.    (Laughs) I said,    Okay. Anything I need to do?     He said,    Well, be there, have the plans. We   ll make you look good.     And they did. I read the little manual that weekend so I could try how to  level a sextant and so forth. But we built that thing.  Was the Army developing any chemical weapons that you know of at  that time?  Not that I know of. That   s why I was trying to go to Aberdeen.  But you didn   t get those orders.  I didn   t get there. I got a company punishment. I got a company  punishment, and some of the people told me,    Man, you need to get  out.    We   d bring the Swiss out. We   d take them, and they would run  into the biggest crowd, and Korea, you know it was  a lot of  people.  You couldn   t have protected them. I had a 45 here, carbine here, a  couple of guys in the back of me had weapons but you   re in a mob like  at homecoming. You couldn   t protect them, thousands of people all  around you. You   ve got two of your enlisted men, and you   ve got three  or four Swedes or Swiss, usually the Swiss, as I said, at least 90 percent.  So you would get them through, and they always wanted to go where the  action was. The Swiss were crazy. They were just crazy. Most of them  were enlisted men.  Were there ever any incidents?  Yes, that   s where I got in trouble. Our standard operating procedure was  we would take them, and as long as they were in South Korea, we  carried them. We had to stay there. Then there was the Swiss Embassy.  We would take them at night to the Swiss Embassy. We would stay  there until they would check into the Swiss Embassy, which was a gated  commune. They   d go in, close the door. We   d leave and go back to the  officers    club in South Korea, and that   s the way it was done. I asked for  the standard operating procedure. They told me it was understood. Once  they get there, they   re in Switzerland. They   re out of your control. No  problem.  One night one of those guys decided to go out to the village after we left  them and scout around   to be polite. (Laughs) But while he was out the  gal or friend, they stole his cameras that he had so when he got back, he  reported that his cameras had been stolen.    Well, how could they steal  your cameras?    He told them that he had been out.    Well, where was  your escort officer?    I was, of course, back at base. This was a month     three weeks before I was to rotate. I had my papers to go to Aberdeen to  go to the chemical school. They called me in.  29  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  They were going to court martial me because I had deserted my post. I  said,    What are you talking about?    They said,    No, there   s nothing in  your standing orders that says you can leave them. You guys should   ve  been staying there at the entrance to the Swiss compound, sleep there in  your Jeep. That   s what you should   ve been doing. You   re not supposed  to          Where do you get that from?    So they pulled out some papers  that none of us had ever seen, this happened to be on my watch. Nobody  had ever seen this. So then I was up for court martial, for desertion. I  said,    As soon as I get out of this, I   m getting out of the Army. This is  just too Mickey Mouse for me.    In the meantime a guy, who had been so  highly decorated and honored, was in Hawaii. He was rotating back, a  Japanese major. He had heard that they were trying to railroad me. If  you   re in the Army and you   re accused of something, you   re guilty.  You   re guilty.  Right, the rights aren   t the same.  Myself and another black lieutenant, we had been getting all those  enlisted men off. We had been getting them off. They would be out in  the town, trading gasoline for favors, Jergens lotion and so forth. We had  been getting them off because we also knew which of the high ranking  officers were also out there. We had been getting them off, so I think  they were after me. I don   t like to think people are after me, but I think  they were.    Put him in his place. He thinks he   s slick.    So, this guy, one  of them had flown back from Hawaii, and a couple of others, they had  come in to testify. I think they decided it was going to be too big of a  mess. So, they asked me would I accept company punishment. I   ve  forgotten the exact designation. I knew at the time, very well. I don   t  remember now. I said,    Yes, I   ll take an honorable discharge and go  home. Write it up.     So where did you return to after Korea?  When I left Korea. Well, I was out. That was the end of my tour so I  went back to Zanesville, then up to Central State. They had the tennis  tournament there every August, and this was in August. Arthur Ashe and  Althea Gibson, the black tennis players, would all be there so I went  back there. Then when I left there, that was the year that Althea won the  U. S. Open. They didn   t call it that then. What did they call it? She won  Wimbledon and that so I decided I would go on to New York.  While I was there I saw, just by coincidence, saw a guy that I had met  when I was a sophomore in college, and we were opening a new  building. The chairman of the department had given me the keys to the  building and asked me to show him around. That was our new science  30  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  building. His name was Dr. Massey. Massey was chairman of the  department at Langston. When he asked me what I planned to do, I told  him    I know exactly what I plan to do.       Research?    I said,    No. I  intend to teach at a small black college. I just love it.    He said,    Okay.    I  went to Prairie View my senior year. I mentioned we went down through  Tennessee. I do have some memory. (Laughs) I had seen Massey. I gave  a paper. He gave a number of papers. He asked me what I was going to  do. I told him that I still planned to teach. I didn   t see Massey anymore.  I dropped  someone  off at the library in New York City, the main  library there. The American Chemical Society was meeting there. I  walked across the street and got in the line to eat my lunch and then go  on to the meetings. The guy right in front of me was Sam Massey. He  said,    Simpson?    The guy in front of him was Woolfolk, my major  professor from Central State. They were in New York City   eight, ten,  eleven million people. What a coincidence  He said,    What are you  doing?    I said,    I just got out of the Army three weeks ago.    He said,     You still plan to teach?    I said,    Yes.    He said,    I got just the place for  you.    He got out of the line and went and called the people at Langston.  I didn   t know whether Langston was in Missouri or Oklahoma. I asked  him. He told me,    Oklahoma.    Lincoln is in Missouri, the black schools.  When he came back he said,    I told him about you. If you want the job  it   s yours.     When did you decide that you wanted to teach at an all-black college?  About two or three days after I got to Central State, as I told you.  It was the first time you had a black teacher?  The first black teacher, but I hadn   t even had a black teacher then. That  would   ve been the next week. You used to have Freshmen Week. We  walked through the garden. We had our candles. The girls were singing  in their white dresses. We were doing whatever boys do at that age.  So you had always known, since then, that you wanted to teach.  That day. That week I knew. This is what I   m going to do. This is what  I   m going to do.  When did you start teaching at Langston?  That would   ve been in 1957. September. September. I didn   t plan to be  here that long, but that other teacher was Lynne   s mother. We were the  department because they had lost three people, and Massey had gone to  be president of Central   North Carolina Central. I can   t think of the  31  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  other guy   s name. I know him. I didn   t know him, but I know of him. He  had gone to be president of a college in North Carolina also. Moore was  ill. That   s why they had called me, or I had called them, or Massey had  called them. That   s why the job was there. Just like that. They had lost  two to be presidents of other schools. And one was in the hospital.  So before we get into Langston too much, I had one question about your  reintegration from your military to civilian life. It might not apply to  you, but you were an officer. You were an African American officer in  the Army and then you came home to a country that was still in the  middle of segregation. Did you ever have any experiences with that?  Having grown up in Zanesville, I didn   t have that much. I didn   t take a  job at Mississippi Valley because I knew I couldn   t handle it. There was  talk about going to Tuskegee to teach. I knew I could handle that  because I had been there but not Mississippi Valley. I couldn   t handle  Mississippi. I would   ve been dead fifty years ago if I had gone to  Mississippi.  Was there anything in your military career that prepared you for the rest  of your life?  Not really.  Schedules or anything like that?  No, I had always been a person who was on schedule from the time I  was a little boy.  Okay.  The military, I tried to tell Lynne that I   m not a good person if you want  to talk about the military because I was never gung ho. (Laughs)  You were already working sun up to sun down.  Yes. I knew about orders. I always liked organized athletics. You were  used to that. And in organized athletics there   s usually not much of a  color line.  So what are some of the most rewarding aspects of teaching at Langston  or any black college, do you feel?  Oh for me, of course, it   s the students. You brag about your students.  You see them come here and it just amazes you. But, not really because  I always saw myself as being like some of them. Because from high  32  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  school, as I said, I was a horrendous student. I never had time for that,  homework.    I   ll pass your test but I don   t have time for homework.    I  knew that some of them had come through that same tract. Then to see  them blossom and go on and get their MDs and their DDSs, and PhDs.  That   s quite rewarding.  Any memorable students come to mind?  Oh gracious, so many.  Right.  I guess the most recent one would be a kid who just   I   ve been retired  twenty-one years   was a kid who came here about six years before I  retired. I   m not going to call his name   I guess I could. I   ll just say  Mark. That could be my grandson. He came here a youngster, just as  eager as he could be. Had a good scholarship. Came out of the ghettos of  Chicago. Because this is on film, I can   t say too much about it, but his  mother was young when he was born. I think his father was not present.  He was just so good. I always remember him because he had a  scholarship, which did not   he couldn   t work. But I couldn   t do  anything in the lab for him. He was always there. He was always  working, until his senior year and we got the cadaver lab, and he  deserted me, because he was pre-med. He was really a biology major.  He spent all of his time up there with me.  Mark was just such a remarkable kid. As I said, we got a research  project going with the Bureau of Mines. We reclaimed some land down  there outside of Henryetta. He was just my boy. He was just my boy, as I  said, until they got that cadaver lab. Then I could never find him.  Anytime you ever wanted to find Mark, he was down there cutting on  those bodies, pulling muscles out. That was his love. That was his love.  He went straight on to med school. There were some kids there from  some of the prestigious black pre-med schools. They didn   t work with  Mark because he was from Langston, and they looked down. They took  extra years. Mark went right straight through, got his MD. I could name,  probably, a dozen or more like that.  His background   do you feel that is common with the majority of  students?  Common? No, we had a lot of kids from professional families. Although  most of our kids now, our graduates, so many of them, their kids are at  OSU, OU, and so forth. We still have some who come to Langston. But  we   re still dealing with a lot of first generation, so maybe yes. Maybe it  is common.  33  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Finchum  Simpson  I   m first generation myself.  Are you?  Yes, I come from an open-enrollment university as well. Langston is still  open-enrollment, right?  Yes. Yes. I   m saying yes.  I think so. I looked on the website.  I think so.  Well, you mentioned that one of your students had trouble getting into  medical school coming from Langston.  No, I didn   t say he had trouble. He went right straight into it.  Oh, he went right into it.  Matter of fact, he continued to support his parents. He got so many  scholarship offers, and he joined the military. He joined the National  Guard.  Oh, he was very successful.  He was just one example.  What are some other advantages or disadvantages to teaching at  Langston?  I   ve often said, recently, that if I had it all to do over again, I probably  would not have gone to a small black school   in science. Science is just  so expensive to try and stay on the cutting edge. Whereas in some of  these other areas, you don   t need as much equipment. You don   t need as  much money for equipment to stay on the cutting edge. It   s hard to do.  So a lack of funding.  I would say a lack of funding would be the biggest disadvantage, but  that probably would apply to most small schools.  I   m just curious why you stayed then.  I loved it. Yes. As I said, in the last few years as I look back, I probably  34  Finchum  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  should   ve gone to Howard. Massey, the one who sent me out here, he  tried to get me to come up there. I wouldn   t go. A couple of other  schools, Xavier, the guy down there tried to get me to go. I didn   t want  to go to New Orleans.  Did you get to come and visit before you agreed to come permanently?  No. I got on the airplane in New York, flew into Zanesville, got on the  train in Zanesville and came through Chicago down to Guthrie, got off  the train. Two guys picked me up, and started teaching class at nine  o   clock. I got off that at three o   clock in the morning and started  teaching. No, there was no visiting. They needed a teacher then. I  needed a job then. (Laughs)  So, I hate to sidetrack, but there was a question that I really wanted to  ask, just because I am so much interested in the aspects of human  equality and education. What role do you feel that education played to  the Civil Rights Movement?  To What?  To the Civil Rights Movement. I know that you lived through such a  great moment in American history. I just wanted to know your thoughts  on that.  Of course, that Greensboro group, the Greensboro Four, that started that  sit-in movement. Education was, I hate to say, all important. That sounds  so trite, but it   s a fact. Although a lot of the people who participated  were not in education. They were uneducated people. They had guts. I  looked at a nice forum on Dick Gregory last night. He gave up millions.  Because he was there, he was with Medgar Evers in Mississippi. He got  on the plane because his son had died. Two weeks later, Medgar Evers  was assassinated in his front yard in front of his wife and kids.  What role did education play? At Tuskegee, it didn   t help them. They all  had doctorates and advanced degrees but they couldn   t go to Tuskegee  and go to a restaurant. There   s a Tuskegee Institute and the Tuskegee  town. The town, of course, was white. The institute was black. So, what  role did education play? Without education, I know I probably would  not have had whatever limited success I   ve had. I know that it has been,  not just for me, for most black folks.  You say limited. It seems like you have been very successful.  I   ve had a good career. As I   ve said, I   m not going to complain about it,  but yes, in terms of if I would not have gone to college, would it have  35  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Finchum  Simpson  been as fulfilling? I don   t know. My father got out of the music business,  got into the trash hauling business because it paid so much more money.  I was working at the drugstore and the fire marshal was going to close  the drugstore down one Saturday evening because trash had not been  taken out. My father had gotten this old piece of truck from one of my  uncles, because of a loan. It was collateral. He had just been running  around town with that old truck so I called him and asked if he come  take that trash out at Carr   s drugstore. He said,    Yes, I could.    While he  was doing that, the people next door at the Greek restaurant they asked  him would he take theirs out. I would guess by the end of the week, we  had that block. (Laughs) I couldn   t help him because I would leave there  and go to the department store to work my six to two shift. But he got  into the trash business. The trash business paid so much money. You  could make money in that business. Most people don   t think of it.  When I was teaching at Langston, they would say,    Here comes the  professor,    but I knew what those jobs paid. J.C. Penney paid fifty a  week. This one would pay twenty-five. This one would pay that, and so  on. You   re not making that kind of money teaching, not back then.  There were thirteen of us  siblings . Eleven of us got our degrees.  Wow.  The twelfth one would have, but she married her sophomore year, and  she followed her husband around to Ohio State, Kalamazoo, here and  there. Then, the other one, the one next to me was retarded. But they all  went on that   of course after what was it       65, when the student loans,  the aid programs came out. When I went there was no student aid  program. You worked, saved your money. And I would do it all over  again. I loved it every minute of it. I really did.  I   m glad to know that. What other roles do you play in your community?  Oh gosh, I   m a deacon at my church. I   ve always been very active with  my fraternity. We clean the graveyard out there. I stay active. Now that  my wife has been ill, that   s a twenty-four/seven job. You   re by yourself  so I   ve pulled back from an awful lot of other things. The only reason  I   m here now is because  my daughter  is out there with her.  Let   s back up and how did you meet your wife?  She was the other chemistry teacher when I got here. She was the other  chemistry teacher. She had been Massey   s star student. Massey is the  one I told you, when I got in line in New York. She had been his star  student. He still said that when she was regional director of the sorority.  36  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Finchum  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Finchum  Simpson  He spoke at their national. He told them,    Your regional director was the  best.    And she was. She   s smart. It is just tragic what has happened.  How many children do you have?  Two   three, three.  What are their names?  Mike is the oldest   I don   t like to say stepson because I   ve had him  since he was four   and then Jim and Lynne.  When did you get married?  I got here in September, and I think she staked her claim of me  immediately. (Laughs) We got married the next July, July 3, 1958. She  staked her claim, or I staked mine. I don   t know which but she was a  very, very intelligent, I thought of course, attractive woman. We were  just simpatico. We were just kind of   she didn   t like to do anything I  liked to do. I liked Chess. She didn   t like Chess. I liked to fish. She  could care less. I don   t know what, but we got along.  Any words of wisdom for a long-lasting marriage?  What   d you say?  Any words of wisdom for a long-lasting marriage?  (Laughs) Compromise is the name of the game. (Laughs) I don   t know.  And I think respect, I really do. And after that, I think it just depends on  the individuals. I think it just depends on the individuals. No, I don   t  have any.  That   s pretty wise to me.  I really do, I think. Don   t tie her down. She was involved in everything.  Everything  And more so as she got along, older, in her career. She was  just involved in everything. She never tried to curtail my activities. Now,  I   m not talking about with other women. (Laughs) Very jealous, and I   m  certain I am too. But, she was a person. I let her spread her wings. Let  her fly   I say let her. She would   ve done it anyway.  How did you pop the question? Or did she?  That   s a good question. (Laughs) That   s a good question. She lived in  Weleetka. She had had an illness so she had been off for a semester. I  37  Higgins  Simpson  Finchum  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  probably should not have pressured her to marry me. I tell her all the  time,    I think you married me in desperation    but she has stuck with it.  But I went by a jewelry store on the corner of Fifth and Main in  Stillwater. Is that Fifth and Main? What   s the main highway, Highway  51?  Sixth.  Sixth and Main. I went by there, picked up a ring and drove on down to  Weleetka that evening and asked her. So how did I pop the question?  Believe me we had some discussions right before then. She had been  sick, and I had been going to see her. And a lot of people, when you get  sick with a contagious disease, they put you down. They don   t come to  see you anymore. Most of them are gone now, and she   s still around.  But, we had discussed things. I won   t say marriage, but we had  discussed things. I pretty well knew what my answer was going to be.  She pretty well knew what the question was going to be. So, when you  ask me how did I propose, that   s difficult to say.  Okay.  But I did propose. I did propose.  So, I think this interview is getting pretty long.  Thank you.  So I   m going to skip a few questions here. I have maybe one or two  questions left to ask, if you don   t mind of course.  Oh I don   t mind. As you can tell, I like to talk.  I love to listen too. Well, here   s a question: Is there anything on your  mind that you haven   t talked about in this interview, that maybe I  haven   t asked about?  Oh, I   m certain there are things on mind that you haven   t asked about  that I haven   t talked about either.  Anything come to mind?  I think I probably regret having gone over to OSU.  What do you mean?  When I went over there everybody told me,    Don   t go over there and  38  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  work on your doctorate in chemistry.    So I didn   t go for three or four  years. There were quite a few guys who had gotten their doctorates.  They said,    Don   t go over there. Don   t get in that department. You   ll  never get out.    I had some of the professors over there   and they   re not  black   to tell me,    Simpson, I   ve got a friend at OU. I   ve got a friend  at   Don   t get in this.     Was it racial aspects?  Yes. So I finally decided I would go on anyway, and I did. I had a friend  over there, I thought, and I think he was, Dr. Hahnic. You wouldn   t  know him. I think he   s been gone a long time. He encouraged me. I  came. They never gave me any money, but then I didn   t need it. I had  money from the National Science Foundation, the university and my GI  bill. I probably made a mistake in going over there. I probably made a  mistake in not transferring to education because quite a few people over  there did.  What year was this?  Oh, gracious,    67,    68,    69. That was before you were born. (Laughs)  Long before I was born.  (Laughs) Yes, that was before you were born.  And that would   ve been right before Martin Luther King was  assassinated.  Right, Yes. He was assassinated April 4, 1968. And so, that would   ve  been right there at that time.  Do you recall that event?  Oh yes, indeed.  Do you mind describing that? Where were you?  Where was I? I was probably teaching. April 4th, I was probably  teaching.  Were there any effects on the community? How did the community react  to that?  Well Langston was not the kind that was going to go up in smoke about  it. Now, where my wife was teaching at that time   she was a  39  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Wilberforce, not the state side. She was at the Wilberforce at that time.  Those students, of course, they went up. They were much more political.  Much more, they were politically more active. I don   t remember  specifically how the students at Langston reacted. I don   t. I don   t. It was  a lot of shock, grief, anger, all of those emotions that you can expect. It  was expected. Everybody knew that he was going to be killed. It was no  question.  So were there tensions between the universities, between Langston and  Oklahoma State?  Well, no that was for me because a lot of people at Langston, my wife  did her doctorate at Oklahoma State. But she started off in chemistry and  got into education, which is what they tried to get me to do.  So it was individual rather than systematic.  Well, when Hale was fired, and that would   ve been in September of    69,  three or four of my professors over there   that was my first year there.  Well no, it wasn   t. That was not my first year. I could tell you when my  first year was but that is not important. They said,    Let   s go have lunch  together.    So we went to have lunch, and they were all in the chemistry  department. They were telling me,    It   s probably a good thing. Maybe  they   ll go ahead and close it down. It   s segregated.    I said,    How you  going to talk about segregated?    We had about a dozen white faculty  members at the time. We had quite a few whites. I said,    You   re sitting  here with 800 full-time faculty members, and you don   t have two black  people, and you   re going to talk about segregation?    So we went to it.  Well, this was my committee and that was not wise. You don   t talk to  your committee. If they say the sky is red you say,    Yes, we have  beautiful red sunsets in Oklahoma.    But we went through that. I was  probably just in the wrong department at the wrong time.  Did you finish your PhD?  No, I didn   t.  Is that the reason why you didn   t finish?  I can   t say that. No, I can   t say that. I have the course work. I had a 3.8,  something like that, with the courses. But we took the comps, and when  we took the Comps, they   d say   seven of us would take it      Three are  going to fail. Three are going to pass. There   s one we don   t know  about.    Well, I knew the one they didn   t know about was me. Three of  them had taken them before. They were pretty well sure they were going  to pass. Three were taking it for the first time, four really, myself  40  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  included. They thought they would do another year. Do I have some  bitterness sometimes about that? Yes.  When I went back that next Monday, they had had a big celebration.  They had taken them all out. We finished writing that exam about noon  on Friday. Saturday they had a big celebration. I knew I had written  thirty-forty pages. I don   t know. They had not had time to grade those  things but they knew who was passing. So they had a big beer party. My  major professor, he said,    I got good news and bad news. What do you  want?    I said,    Give me the good news.       The good news is you wrote  the best paper of anybody.    I said,    Great. What about the bad news?        They want you to take two more courses.    I said,    They   re not in my  program.       Yes, but they   re on your committee, and they want you to  take those two courses.    I said,    No. This is where we are.    I never did  take the courses. I started working back at Langston. I don   t know.  Getting more now than you want huh?  Oh, no. not at all. I could sit here for days. If you had one thing that you  would want people to know   throughout the lessons you   ve learned in  life   what would that be? If you had one message to tell future  generations, based on the things you   ve witnessed or experienced, what  would that be?  Let   s see, I can   t come up with something. If I were writing a  dissertation, I   d probably sit there and say this or that, try to think of  some Biblical scripture. I don   t have anything like that.  Well, you mentioned the idea that people in groups, they might act a  certain way, and then individuals interact a different way.  I think so. Yes. But that wouldn   t have anything to do with a message in  life to me, to me it wouldn   t. No, I don   t want to say have realistic goals  because I didn   t have any goals. You know? I don   t want to say  something like that. You see, I hate it when you ask me questions like  that because it   s like I   m searching for some scholarly thing.  It doesn   t have to be scholarly.  And I don   t have one, as I said. Believe in yourself. Believe in what  you   re doing. And work, because frequently there   s no going back.  What advice would you give to a future educator, such as myself. I plan  to teach one day. What advice would you offer for that?  Do you want to teach?  41  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  I will, yes. I do want to teach.  That   s the main thing to me is do you love teaching, and I did. I loved it.  I like to talk. (Laughs) I got paid to talk. Know your subject. Know your  subject. You   re not going to be the best. If you were the best, you  wouldn   t be in Oklahoma or Langston or OSU. If you   re the best in the  world, you   re not going to be there but be as good as you can be.  Right.  Be as good as you can be.  Absolutely.  Don   t let anybody be better because they worked harder. If they just got  more intelligence, hey.  Fair enough.  But don   t let anybody out work you. Don   t let anybody out work you.  I think that was your profound message right there.  (Laughs) I always felt like that. I felt like that no matter where else I   ve  been. I always felt that. I   ve never been in a chemistry class where  anybody beat me. That   s not true. That   s not true. I took advanced  organic chemistry at OSU, and there was this guy there. I can   t recall his  name. He was Chinese. He was Chinese. But on those exams   I won   t  call the professor   s name   he gave 150 point exams. He   d make 145,  146. I   d make about 140. The next highest score would be about 75, and  all those guys have their PhDs now. They   d sit there and make 75s and  60s. But that was the only course I   ve ever taken in chemistry where  somebody consistently beat me. Was he better or did he just work  harder? I don   t know. They told me his schedule. Gracious  He had a  schedule. He was disciplined. You know? He may have just been better.  He had discipline, and I had found out that   s the most important thing.  You   ve got to have a native ability of course, you know.  Of course.  But how hard are you willing to work? You almost need tunnel vision.  And yet, to be a good teacher, I think you   ve got to have more than  tunnel vision. You   ve got to look at the whole picture, which I hope I   ve  done.  This has been enlightening for me. I would really like to appreciate you  42  Simpson  Higgins  Simpson  Higgins  Simpsons  for taking your time to talk with us.  Well, I   ve enjoyed it.  It was my honor, of course. Do you have anything else you want to add?  No.  Alright. Well thank you very much, sir.  Thank you.  -------  -------
