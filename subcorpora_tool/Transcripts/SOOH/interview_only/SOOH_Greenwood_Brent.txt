 Little Thunder This is Julie Pearson Little-Thunder. Today is November 13, 2014, and  I   m interviewing Brent Greenwood for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project sponsored by Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  OSU. We   re at Brent   s studio in Edmond. Brent, you   re Chickasaw and  Ponca. You attended the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe  and got your BFA  bachelor of fine arts  from Oklahoma City  University. Your works range from expressionistic to more abstract,  and you sometimes incorporate real objects for a three-dimensional  effect. You   ve really gained a lot of momentum over the last several  years, and tomorrow night you   ll be showing at the Cowboy and  Western Heritage Museum in the Small Wonders show. Thank you for  taking the time to talk with me.  Greenwood Thank you.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Greenwood I was born in Midwest City, Oklahoma. Grew up in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma, and in particular the south side of Oklahoma City. Born and  raised in a metro area, but I   ve always had the connections and family  up at Ponca City, more so than I did initially from my relatives in the  southeastern part of the state, but I   ve always had that knowing of  where I come from and who I was as a Chickasaw, urban Chickasaw-  Ponca Indian.  Little Thunder Can you talk a bit about your folks, what they did for a living?  Greenwood Sure. My father, I think in the beginning when I think back of what he  did, I think he worked a couple jobs when I was younger. Then he  started working at the US Postal Service. I know he used to work for a  local pizza place called Crystal   s Pizza, which we loved. I think he may  have worked that and the post office at the time, because thinking back  5  when I started the post office, it was part-time and we had to  supplement our part-time with another job, so he was working two jobs.  My mom was working at Southwestern Bell as a receptionist. That   s  what she did. My dad, I think at the post office he was more into the  clerical side of it, mail handler. He wasn   t a mailman, but he was a mail  handler.  Like I said, it was kind of cool that he worked two jobs, one at the post  office, but one at the pizza place because whenever they had mess-ups  on pizzas,    Dad   s home, yay     (Laughter) We was always looking  forward to those nights when Dad was working late because he was  coming home with pizza, and we were just like,    Ah     I also look back  on those years, and those are probably some of my most obese years, I  guess you could say. (Laughs) I was really kind of a little chunky guy,  and I think it was all those extra pizzas Dad used to bring home.  Anyway, that   s what my parents did. Dad worked two jobs, and my  mom was working at Southwestern Bell.  Little Thunder How about brothers or sisters, siblings?  Greenwood Yeah, I have two sisters. I   m the oldest, and my sisters were all   stair-stepped.  We   re all two years apart. It   s funny how I was envious of  them. This is probably the way that it goes with older siblings, is that  you   re more, I think, restricted on things, but the younger ones always  get to do things sooner than you did. It happened that way with my  sisters, and I was envious. I was kind of mad in a way, whatever. I have  two sisters.  Little Thunder How about your exposure to art in the home growing up?  Greenwood Art was always something that, I think, my parents recognized as me  having a ability to do and express myself. I got my first art award from  illustrating a book. Back then, when you   re young and looking at other  people   s style, all you   re doing is mimicking their style. That   s what I  was doing. I could look at a picture and draw it detail for detail, so I got  my first art award when I was like in the fourth grade. I think it was  before then my parents were always saving my artwork, and they were  buying me art books. As I got older and realized that we are Indian, we  are Native American, then I started being more influenced by early, not  to say early Indian art but Indian art in general.  You   ll probably get to this question, but I   ll just tell you now. Some of  my early influences were the Oklahoma artists that I knew, that I was  aware of. That was Rance Hood and Jerome Tiger. There was art that I  really did like growing up, but I didn   t always know the names, so as I  started becoming more aware of the art, I realized the other art that I  6  was influenced by but at that young age didn   t realize the artists  themselves. There was Woody Crumbos, there were Acee Blue Eagles,  there were the Kiowa Five, Robert Redbird, these other Oklahoma  artists that had influenced my work at a very young age, which I didn   t  even know their names or faces.  The two that I know I could definitely relate to at that young age was  Rance Hood and Jerome Tiger. Those are the artists that I really started  mimicking their style and doing the flow of it all, the warriors on  horseback like Rance does, the stickballers of Jerome Tiger, just the  flow of everything, of Jerome Tiger. His natural drawing ability, I was  kind of in awe of that. Me being a drawer, I guess you   d say, first  before a painter, before any of that I was really inspired by what he did  and motivated to pursue or keep doing what I did at that time.  Little Thunder What is your first memory of making art, very first memory?  Greenwood Oh, man, the dirt, (Laughs), in the dirt playing with   . I can remember  using sticks and making marks in the dirt with rocks and sticks, making  mud, being real hands-on about it, and then just the typical crayon. I  remember doing all those things, some, not all of them. I do have a  recollection of doing some of the drawings and things like that. Even  back then, thinking about it, I really did gravitate towards color. I did  like a lot of color, so all my pieces always had crayon color marks and  things like that. It goes back to elementary school, as far as I can  remember.  Little Thunder And your first exposure to Native art, was it through a book, do you  remember or     Greenwood I think it was, from what I recall, pictures on the wall that I would see in  a public place. That   s what   s so cool is that even me at a young age  realizing that and picking up on that. That   s why that   s so important to  have art in public places, because it   s going to be influential. It   s  everyone from   I don   t even know how old I was, but I was a very  young person when I noticed the art on the walls and Jerome Tigers and  things like that. That   s why I think that   s very vital, art in public places,  art in buildings, whatever. That   s where I think I first really started  taking notice was art in the public sense.  Little Thunder You   re growing up in this urban area. Were you pretty involved with the  urban Indian community in Oklahoma City?  Greenwood I would say somewhat through school I was. Plus, being on the south  side, we had other Indian friends. We had a lot of Mexican friends,  Mexican Indian friends, so there was a mix, nice mix of ethnic people, I  7  guess you would say. All the influences I had from my Native friends  was all from a urban perspective because I didn   t grow up around our  Ponca reservation, like we like to say: our White Eagle area. I went  back home for holidays. I went back for celebrations and dances and  meetings we had. All my circle of friends were urban Indians, urban  people. That was my area of influence. There was only a few of us that  were really artists expressing ourselves. I grew up in the    80s. I was a  child of the    80s, so I was into breakdancing and hip-hop and graffiti.  Jumping ahead there, but that was my early influences.  Little Thunder So what were your art experiences like in elementary school? Any  memories that stand out?  Greenwood Yeah, it   s funny you bring that up because there was this one class I  had. It was a third- and fourth-grade class that was combined. I guess  even back then we were lacking in teachers and we had to combine  some classes at my elementary school. This is, I think, to this day one of  the coolest projects I ever did. Our teacher, she had us do a self-portrait  of ourself and put it on our journal. We had weekly themes, and we had  to write stories. I still have this book somewhere, but it   s just a spiral  notebook with my portrait on there. I remember the shirt I drew. I  remember wearing that. I remember that haircut. It   s a crayon self-portrait,  and all these stories are funny to read because they   re thematic.  They   re just from the imagination of a child that didn   t have internet,  didn   t have all this stuff, didn   t have all this outside influence. It really  did show the imaginative side of what a child can do. To me, that   s like  one of the greatest projects I ever did was incorporate writing. It  incorporated drawing with my portrait. I think I sketched on a few of  the pages. It was combining those elements of writing, the analytical  side, plus the creative side. To me to this day, I think it that   s one of the  coolest projects I ever did. When I think of something, that really  formal drawing, that   s one of them because I did my self-portrait. I  remember that art award I got which was in, I think, the fourth grade.  So those are my earliest recollections of school, art in the school.  Little Thunder How about at the secondary level or junior high level?  Greenwood Yeah, it was more of continuing   in middle school it was more like  independent study because it was like   . I don   t even readily recall  taking an art class per se in middle school, but I did it all the time. I still  was drawing. Even more so in middle school, my drawings start more  mimicking Rance Hood and Jerome Tiger, even to the point where my  Indian Education director got me into an art show, which was at the  Crossroads Mall. I entered, and then they kicked me out of it, so to  speak. They pretty much didn   t let my entry get into the show because  8  they said I traced one of Rance Hood   s paintings. In a way, that was a  compliment. I said,    Well, if I   m that technical that they thought I  traced   .     My Indian ed director tried to tell me that she tried to take up for me.  They said,    No, he traced one of Rance   s paintings. That   s not art.    I  said,    Wow, I must be pretty technical in drafting and all that to be able  to come across as someone who traced one of his pieces.    All I did was  I took his   I think there was one, it was a buffalo hunt, and then I took  the same idea, used his style. Even back then, I realized I didn   t want to  copy anyone, necessarily. I knew that I had to take what they did but to  make it my own, so although it was typical Rance Hood style, the hair  and everything, feathers, and the painted horses, it still had something  different that that painting I looked at didn   t.  I think I put these buffalos in there. They were, like, a different  composition obviously, but there again I had the flying owls or the  scissortail coming out. I drew one of those. They can   t tell me that they  said,    This is just like this painting,    because it   s not. It   s his style,  obviously, and I mimicked his style to a degree that they thought I  traced it. That was in middle school, and then high school was more   I  had a couple of formal art classes where I did get some painting and get  introduced to some different mediums, which that was cool.  Little Thunder Watercolor or acrylics?  Greenwood One of them was on felt, felt board. It was pastel on felt board. It was  pretty cool, though. I mean, it was oil pastels. I did a lot of blending,  and it was on felt. That was one of the cool projects I did. Even then,  like I said, I was using my hands to feel like I wasn   t constricted to just  a paintbrush or a pencil. It was helping me to explore a little bit, step  outside the box.  Little Thunder Right. So how about after high school? What happened?  Greenwood Didn   t want to go to college. (Laughs). That   s for sure. Didn   t want to  go to college. I figured I had enough schooling. I was just wanting to  take a break. My parents, (I   m thankful for them) they encouraged me  to go and pursue a degree. They said,    We went, but we didn   t finish.  You   ll be the first one, if you go and finish, you   ll be the first one in our  family.    I   ve heard that before from my generation,    you   ll be the first  one to go college and graduate.    I felt like if they   re going to support  me enough and encourage me with my art, (I got a partial scholarship at  OCU; it   s where I started out) then I might as well try it and see. When  I got to college, it kind of opened my eyes up to a whole new world of  9  possibility. Therefore I tried to do a bunch of different things. I joined a  fraternity. (Laughs)  My wife still questions me to this day,    Why the heck did you ever get  in that fraternity?    I got in the fraternity. I got into doing different  things in school. Art, did my art. Probably did a little bit of partying.  That   s maybe what geared my idea towards a fraternity, but that   s  another story. That   s not the emphasis, right? The emphasis was on the  art. It always has been. My first year there, I was learning all these  fundamentals of art, the basics, like I say. The second year, it was like I  didn   t feel a challenge. I was trying to ask. I was trying to reach out  because my work still to a degree looked like Jerome Tiger or Rance  Hood, the typical, what later becomes for me Oklahoma art. It had that  same look, but I wanted to do something more than just painting  feathers and Indian guys, their hair blowing in the wind and wrapped in  a blanket, and silhouette of a moon, you know, silhouettes of  landscapes, and elements of moons and suns.  I wanted to do more than that, but I wasn   t able to tap into my potential,  I guess, because I didn   t know how to. I knew about the Institute of  American Indian Arts. I heard about it my senior year in high school,  but I didn   t   . My art teacher at the time gave me the information, but I  just couldn   t get my stuff together. Like I said, I wasn   t ready. I didn   t  feel like I was ready, and everything happens for a reason. Say I did go  to IAIA right out of high school. No telling where I would   ve ended up,  I think. The fact that I did go to OCU and I stayed local, I was able to  go home and still   because moving out, it   s kind of scary. I had to live  on campus, but I always could go home when I wanted to because of  my family. They built that foundation for me, of family, of tradition.  We are also raised in the Methodist Church. I had that as a religious  base, as well as our Native American spirituality of the Native  American Church. I always had that strong foundation. Being close to  home the first couple of years really did, I think, make a difference  because then I was ready for IAIA.  Then it wasn   t such a culture shock. What I noticed when I was out  there, some of these students right off the res, eighteen, some seventeen,  they couldn   t cut it. It was such a culture shock. Even though you   re  around other Indians, being away from home, some for the very first  time, they couldn   t deal. There was a lot of drop outs. There was some  partying going on to the extreme that they got kicked out, so it was  different things. I was like,    I   m kind of glad I took two years before I  come out here. I might   ve been one of those students that just came  right back home because of partying or just not able to handle it at that  age of eighteen.    When I went out there, I was like twenty and got  introduced to a whole new world that opened my eyes up to a whole  10  new world of possibilities, really. Then from there, like I said, that   s  when I really got introduced to the artists, some of the artists I   d seen  growing up but couldn   t always associate names.  That   s when I really started becoming aware of the movement of Indian  art and contemporary Indian art and how it spoke to people, how it  moved people, the narratives of it all, the political side of it, the  beautiful side of it. All this stuff really overwhelmed me to a point  where   I mean, I was glad. I was like a sponge. I was taking it all in  and learning the most I could, at the same time having to step outside  my box of what was known to me and that Oklahoma style of art, and  my teachers helping me see things from a different perspective, turning  my paintings around, looking at them upside down, doing monotypes to  come up with my painting color palettes and stuff like that. All these  different   influx of ideas, really did help mold me into the artist I am  today. Lloyd Kiva New, the founder of the school, one of his founding  principles was to bring the Indian out in the young people, the  Indianness. I can see it totally fulfilled that mission with me, and it   s  still doing that today, so that was great. I finished there, and then I came  back to OCU, finished up my bachelor   s.  Little Thunder Did you have any outstanding teachers, or do you remember some  classmates over there that continued the artist path?  Greenwood Yeah, oh, yeah, there   s a lot of them that I still am friends with today.  They   re full-time artists. They   re from the area, so they   ve been full-time  artists ever since, going back to the late 1990s, early 2000s  because they   re in an area where   Indian Market. They   re in the region  where this is such a big thing and people appreciate it. Not saying they  don   t appreciate it here, but it   s like there   s more of a awareness  and   word I   m looking for. There   s more appreciation for it, I guess, is  what I   m trying to say. It   s in the architecture, it   s in everything you see  out there. It   s in the foods and the culture, style, whatever. It   s out there.  It   s in that area. My friends that are successful today, they were doing  this ten, fifteen, years ago because they   re in the area.  I always call it the Mecca for Indian art. That   s what I always used to  refer to it as. Luckily, we look back, and we laugh at our IAIA days  because we   re like,    Man, we were crazy back then.    Looking at some  of our projects like,    Oh, my God, that was terrible. What were we  thinking?    But looking at us now, it was all part of that process,  learning process, and it was great. I have a good number of friends that  are successful in the art world and outside, too, doing things. IAIA  really did have an influence in our life. Even the ones that didn   t  graduate, that went there part and didn   t finish, it made a lasting  impression upon them, and we   re still friends today.  11  Little Thunder When did you sell your first piece of art?  Greenwood Out of college. Growing up, I don   t think I really ever sold anything. I  just gave things away. Some of the girlfriends I had in high school, I  was always drawing them pictures. Those might pop up on eBay or  something. (Laughs) I was always drawing silly pictures for girlfriends  in high school, and I was always giving things away. I set some goals  for myself once I graduated college with my bachelor   s. I said,    Okay,  within five years I want to be in a gallery.    I started setting these goals  because I felt my art was still kind of, it just wasn   t mature enough. I  was still experimenting with all this color and design elements, so I set  these long-term goals. I graduated in    96. It   s funny, there   s a Red Earth  reference. Okay, in    96 I graduated. The following year, working on my  art part-time, I started the post office part-time, so I was working at the  post office part-time. Anyway, I   ve been going to Red Earth as a  dancer, as a spectator, and now I   m in this art area, art world.    Okay,  this is local. Let   s try it.     I apply for Red Earth, and I get rejected. I   m like,    Aw, man     At this  time, my studio   s in the garage. I   m trying to make a way for myself.  The things I had at the time were still kind of similar to what I paint  today, but it was a little more tighter, I think. I can see today the  evolution or the progression of my art where there   s more depth in it  today as opposed to what it was like in 1997 when I got denied out of  Red Earth. I took that with a grain of salt, but at the time, being  relatively young, you   re offended a little bit.    What? I can   t believe  that. I   ve seen some of the art there, and I didn   t get in?    (Laughs) Just  some of the art. There was some of the artists, you wonder,    How the  heck did I not get in?    Anyway, my figurative pieces have always been  about form, shape, and shading, and not so much the details of the  fingers, let   s say, or the eyes, and the mouth.  It   s always been about form and shape. I guess it all happened with  figure drawing because in my figure drawing classes at OCU, I was  focusing on shapes. I did some little things here and there with the hair  and stuff, but it was always about shapes when I transitioned into my  paintings. When I started doing more Native subjects, it kind of stayed  the same. The faces were non-descriptive, and so the pieces I submitted  for Red Earth were those figurative pieces. I told my wife, I said,     Maybe I should start working on faces. Maybe I should start doing  that. Maybe that   s why I didn   t get in because they don   t get it.    My  wife said,    Don   t change your style just because of what some people  think. You do what you want to do, and people will appreciate you  eventually for you. Continue to do your thing. Don   t feel like you have  to conform to fit anyone   s standards. Just do your thing.     12  She really did give me a little pep talk. I said,    Okay, that   s cool. So  now what? Well, let   s start thinking about galleries.    I pulled out my  Southwest Art magazines, art whatever, Native Peoples. Started pulling  out all my Indian magazines and going through galleries.    Looks like a  good gallery, looks like a good gallery.    Now, at that same time, I got  commissioned for a piece. At this time this bank, (it was a Native  American bank) they were doing a promotional card, phone card, to  give out to clients. On one of my pieces I have from my graduating  exhibit from OCU, we had to have a senior exhibit, so one of my pieces  was just feathers. It was done on paper, paint, mixed media. It was kind  of a cool piece to put on this phone card.  They gave me a number of these phone cards as a compensation. I said,     Well, shoot, this is like a business card.    My wife, she really did help  me. She helped me brainstorm on what to do. She said,    You look at the  galleries. You can work on this promotional piece. Just send it out. Say     My name   s   .    A little brief summary about your bio, about yourself  and tell them       (I don   t even remember how we worded it)          As a  token of appreciation, please accept this ten-minute gift phone card on  me. Enjoy the work. Hopefully, we can do business in the future.       You  know, really trying to market. Anyway, I sent out to like thirty-one  galleries. They were from California, New Mexico, Colorado, some  here in Oklahoma. I think those are about the four states we focused on,  maybe one in Utah somewhere, but thirty-one galleries, right?  One calls me back and says,    Well, we really like your work. We saw  some images of your work.    I think I sent some photos or whatever, but  the card, they said,    We really like your card. We appreciate that phone  card, but we   re not taking any new artists at this time.    I said,    Okay,  well, I thank you for calling me back.    Another gallery in Santa Fe  called me and said,    We   d like to see more of your work. Is there any  way you can give us more examples?    It just so happened, (it   s like  how things all happen for a reason) it was like a month away from  Gathering of Nations Powwow, and we were planning on going. I told  them,    Actually, I   ll be in Albuquerque for a powwow in a month. I can  stop by the gallery then and bring you some pieces.    They said,    Yeah,  go ahead and do that. Make sure you call first,    whatever. The gallery  was Kiva Fine Art. I go out there for the Gathering.  I took out three pieces, some from my show. At that time, they   re all  mixed media pieces on paper. I think there   s two on paper, one on  canvas. At any rate, I took out those three pieces, and they kept two of  them. They said,    We really like this style. If you want to work on some  more pieces, go ahead and do that, and we   ll see how these move.    I  forgot how she worded it, but she said,    We   ll see how these do, and  13  we   ll stay in touch.    I didn   t know how to price my pieces. I said,     Okay.    It was fifty-fifty. I said,    Well, how about  1,750?    I was like,     That   s kind of high,    but my wife was,    Whatever.    They were okay  with it. The piece is only, it was probably the size of this. It was framed,  so it was like a 24    by 30   . The other piece was like  1,200, but that   1,750, I was like,    That   s kind of high, but we   ll see.    Two weeks later  they call back,    Hey, we need some more of your work. That piece for   1,750? We sold it.     Little Thunder That   s great.  Greenwood I was like,    Are you serious?  Really?    I couldn   t believe it. I was  shocked  That kind of secured my spot with Kiva Gallery, and I   ve been  with them since 2010. The only reason I   m not with them anymore is  that they lost their lease, basically. After being there for twenty-some  years, the landlord was raising their rent and not cutting them any  breaks, so they had to    Gallery business is tough in Santa Fe. They  had to relocate so they could stay open, keep their doors open. They  relocated to another spot, but I never relocated with them. By then, it  was hard for me keep things out there and do things here. We still have  a good relationship, but, yeah, that kind of secured my spot with Kiva  Gallery. I   d been with them for, what, fifteen years or something like  that. It was a great relationship, and it was funny how it all fell into  place. Even though I didn   t get into Red Earth, I got into Kiva Gallery. I  did that for a number of years.  During Indian Market, we had a special showing. I did that for a  number of years and didn   t really think about Indian Market necessarily  until about 2005. Then I applied for that. In 2005 I applied for SWAIA   Southwestern Association for Indian Arts, Santa Fe Indian Market  and  I got rejected. I said,    Oh, no, here we go again     (Laughs) I got  rejected, so I was like,    Oh, man.    I was somewhat seasoned because  I   d been in the gallery since    97, and it was about 2005 when I finally  applied. I was dejected a little bit, and I said,    Okay, whatever.    I think  that first year I was really trying for the fellowship, too, because I  remember applying for that fellowship and I didn   t get it. Anyway, I  think I waited another five years before I applied again. I felt like I was  working up to it, so I applied again in 2010 and entered   a print. It was  a print; it was a woodblock. It was a woodblock I did. I went back and  colored it with acrylic and made it look like ledger art. I put that in my  printmaking because it was a woodblock, and I got First Place.  I want to say that secured my spot at Indian Market, but I   ve been doing  SWAIA Indian Market ever since that. Anyway, long story short, that   s  not short, but long story, that   s the beginnings of my exposure and  experience in a gallery, and art market world, and where I   m at today.  14  Still doing the art markets, and I   m really expanding now because I   m  doing, like you   ve mentioned, I   m doing that Small Works, Great  Wonders show. I   m doing another show, (this   ll be my second year to  do this show in Denver) the Coors Western Art Exhibit. It   s a part of the  National  Western  Stock and Sale Show, so I   m part of that show, and  that   s invitation only.  I don   t really consider myself a Western artist, and it   s all contemporary  Western art, but yet obviously we   re a part of that history, our Indian  people. You see it, going way back, us and the Plains, and the influence  of European clothing, and lifeways on us, and how we adapted and  made it our own. In a sense, I guess some of my things I am doing is  Western, so they consider it like that. In that Western show in Denver,  last year there were only two other artists, and that was Arlo   Namingha  and Dan Namingha. This year we got, of course, Arlo and  Dan coming back, and then Melanie Yazzie, who was a former  printmaking instructor of mine at IAIA, so it   ll be cool to see her.  Little Thunder What was that show like your first time going     Greenwood Oh it was, it was like     Little Thunder    and it   s a big city.  Greenwood I keep calling it the Cowboy Hall of Fame, but the Western Heritage  Art Museum. Is that what we call it now?  Little Thunder  National  Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, I think is what it   s  called.  Greenwood Okay, Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum. It was like that but on a  smaller scale. The art there, some of the art there was really amazing. It  was really different, yet some of the stuff there was like impressionistic,  really impressionistic, and some was really abstract. It was horses and  cows, but it was just really a nice mix of art. I could see how my stuff  would fit in there. It was cool. It was a cool experience to be a part of  that.  Little Thunder Did you have some good sales?  Greenwood Yeah, I sold two pieces. I took three pieces and sold two pieces there.  Since it was my first year ,one of the volunteers said,    You know, if you  sell anything here they   re going to have you back.    (Laughs) I said,     Well, that   s cool,    because I sold two pieces, so that was awesome. Of  course, now this year I   m speaking on the panel. They have me  speaking on one of their panels, so that   s kind of cool.  15  Little Thunder Congratulations, that   s great.  Greenwood Thank you.  Little Thunder How about SEASAM  Southeastern Art Show and Market ? Did you do  that when they started the Southeastern     Greenwood I   ve been a part of the Chickasaw Southeastern Arts Market probably  since its beginnings. It was a Clayburn Straughn show at first, and then  it transitioned shortly thereafter to the Southeastern Art  Show  and  Market, SEASAM. That   s what it transitioned to, and then I   ve been  with that ever since. I saw it as a way to   when I do my art, it   s either  really focusing on Plains or Southeastern, and then sometimes there   s a  mix of the two but only into the sense that you see clothing and stuff.     Well, yeah, this guy could   ve been from the Plains, but he also has  Southeastern elements.    That   s the only the time because there was this  mix of European clothing and culture and style for the Chickasaws,  obviously, because we had experience with the Americans way before  even my Ponca people did. There was still that adaptation of clothing  and elements and things like that.  What I don   t do, I don   t ever mix the two cultures, like Chickasaw,  whatever. I keep it pretty much separate when I focus on one or the  other. It   s really going to be Southeastern or really Ponca. It   s not really  going to be a combination of the two. Like I said, the clothing is the  only thing that you can see obvious similarities in both that I   m working  on. Plus, my wife is Otoe, so I am encouraged   I   m not going to say  encouraged but I do like a lot of elements of Otoe culture, things they   re  really known for, floral work, some of the things that they have with  their dress and their attire, which is somewhat similar to our Ponca  people. I have those influences, as well, so I always incorporate that.  When I want to focus on my Ponca or Plains pieces, some of the Otoe  elements come out, too.  Little Thunder How did you two meet?  Greenwood It was at OCU.  Little Thunder Oh, it was at OCU?  Greenwood Yeah, it was through a mutual friend.  Little Thunder She wasn   t studying art, too?  16  Greenwood No, and I could say how the occurrence all happened, how we met, but I  don   t want to, since this is going to be out there, I   m not going to say  the friend we met through, although it   s kind of a funny story. Anyway,  we met through a mutual friend.  Little Thunder But definitely, she   s been a good business partner. That   s sometimes the  hardest thing when you   re an artist is dealing with the business part.  Greenwood Yeah, especially in the beginning. She   s been very encouraging to help  me in any way she can, as she could, with ideas and things like this.  Now even today she maintains my website when she can. She   s a  graphic designer now. I think the art   s always been in her background,  too, and she just never   . Even when I was meeting her, we were doing  small art shows together. She was painting candles and doing small  canvasses because she had this little artsy nature about her, too. Then  she got hired on to work for her tribe at a local office, simply as a  receptionist. Then they started needing other things like business cards  and working things on a computer. Started out pretty simple, but then  they sent her to school for graphic design and paid for it. Now she   s like  their head of   if they had a graphic design department, she   d be the  director because she handles everything.  What   s cool about it is she uses that artistic influences from her Otoe  side and upbringing, whatever she   s done, and she incorporates that in a  graphic design sense and has that sensibility about her when she does  her artwork through graphic Photoshop or   . I don   t know what  programs she uses, but she   s very skilled at that. She designs my  business cards and things I can   t even imagine. When I   m still trying to  think about cut and paste,    Here, do it this way,    and she   ll flip stuff.  Even when I was in college, taking commercial art classes, it was still  pretty much cut and paste. That was in the early    90s. We didn   t have  access to the computer stuff they do now. It makes things so much  easier to do things on a computer and make it look really nice and sharp  and artsy. Yeah, she uses that to her full benefit, everything she   s  learned, and still continues to learn. She   s always had that influence.  Little Thunder I like your website. What were some early reactions when you  developed this mature style, and, as you say, you   re focusing on form,  you   re not focusing on features? I saw that you mentioned Bert  Seabourn as kind of an influence a little bit, but also I thought of  Virginia Stroud a little bit and what she does. But what were some early  reactions to your work? Do you remember, either the best compliment  or maybe the funniest reaction?  Greenwood I   ll get the funniest one out of the way. (Laughter) I think this was at the  gallery. When I was doing gallery shows during Indian Market, we  17  always hung around the gallery to talk about our work, try to sell our  work. I didn   t know. I let people look at it and take it in for what they  wanted to, however they were engaged. Then if they had any questions,  I would sit there and,    Okay, if you have any questions, I   m the artist.     I   d let them kind of digest it first. There were these two ladies in  particular. It was one of my figurative pieces, which just had shadows  and a face, no face, really. They were looking at it, and they   re this  close, (gestures) and they   re kind of   . They   re looking at each other.  I was just getting ready to say,    If you have any questions on the  artist       but as I was getting ready to say that, she leaned over to her  friend and said,    Oh, he must can   t paint faces.    (Laughs) And she was  like,    Yeah,    and they started to walk on. I was like,    I   m not going to  say nothing. I don   t have to. I don   t have to defend myself. If that   s  what they got from it   .    There was so much things going on in that  piece with a message. It was a narrative piece. I think the piece was  dealing with the Osage oil murders, so the foreground was an Osage  man, and the back was his wife in the car waiting on him. She was  looking out the window like,    Come on, what are you doing?     He   s sitting there in the foreground. I had all these oil derricks in the  background and on the side I had Wah-Sha-She  The Water People .  Instead of blood dripping, it was oil dripping, representing the blood. In  the underpainting I had, there was blood splatters, but to show the  transition of horse to the car, I had tire tracks coming. They started out  as horse tracks, and they turned into tire tracks to the car. Anyway, that  was referencing   I think I had text in there. I always liked, used to  incorporate text of stories and facts. I would incorporate, collage it in  there and paint over it but keep some evident so you can catch things  that the message was being expressed.  That particular piece, it has some of those elements of it, but it was  dealing with the 1920s, those Osage oil murders because my whole  thing is that I wanted people to get from it what they wanted to, but at  the same time get some factual information to make them look.    What  was this? What   s he referencing,    or    What   s he talking about?    I  didn   t want to put it out there, and it   s in your face and so political that  you just can   t look at it.    Oh, my God it   s   .    I have done some pieces  like that, but I   m real subtle about it, I think, to a degree where they can  enjoy it on their own level and then at the same time maybe go look up  the information for themselves. That   s what I try to do: give them  indirect little nuggets of information about our story, whatever that  painting may be focusing on at that time, but that   s the funniest.  Little Thunder Yes.  18  Greenwood I think one of the highest compliments   the fact that I   m doing what  I   m doing and people can relate to it and are engaged and want to have  a piece of this experience in their home for however long, that, to me,  that   s the highest compliment. That, and whenever I have another artist  actually invest and want to buy something that I   ve done. I said,    Wow,  that   s pretty cool.    I   ve done that, too. I   ve bought other artists    works.  You really do have   as an artist, too, you still are overcome by some  people   s work.    Man, I got to have that, and I   m going to buy it.     That   s the coolest thing is that you can really have that effect on people.  That, to me, I always used to say, that   s the reward. It   s not financial or  anything like that. I don   t do it for the money. I do it for the sharing of a  story, of a culture, of who we are.  To me, anything additional, that   s icing on the cake, but it   s more about  getting my message out there and just doing it for the sake of doing it  because I enjoy what I do. That   s what drives me. It   s not like,    If I  paint this, I   m going to get five hundred dollars,    or,    If I do this I   m  going to get   .    It   s not about that, but it   s nice because it helps pay  bills and helps fund my next art show. (Laughs) That   s always the fun  side of it, but it   s a cycle, and it encourages us and encourages me as an  artist to keep doing what I   m doing. It   s positive reinforcement that I  can do this to the point where I was able to quit my full-time job at the  US Postal Service. Although I work, still, somewhat a full-time job  here, I   m local. I took a leap of faith. It   s public education. I   m able to  supplement that income by my art sales and what I do. I knew this first  year was going to be rough. We   re still in this first year. It   s been  pleasantly   .  Little Thunder As assistant director.  Greenwood Yeah, as a program assistant     Little Thunder Right, program assistant.  Greenwood    yeah, which sounds all nice and big, but it just means you   re a    do  this, do that.    No, I   m just kidding. (Laughter) This first year   s been   .  Like I say, I was wondering, I was really thinking,    Okay, what   s plan  B if this doesn   t work out, if we can   t make it with my art sales and art  show money?    I can always go work at the post office here. I know the  job, in and out, if it came down to that. Luckily, that hasn   t even been  an option. The art opportunities keep coming up to where I got three  shows next year already, so it   s really good. Like I said, it   s  encouraging. It   s continuing to keep that cycle going and keeping me  encouraged to do what I do.  Little Thunder Have you had any mural commissions yet?  19  Greenwood Yes, I   ve had, actually, two. The Poncas have commissioned me,  and.     Little Thunder For their tribal complex?  Greenwood Yes, it   s at the tribal affairs building. The funny thing about that is it   s  still incomplete. It   s about 90 percent done, but it   s because at the time I  had the contract, my mom was on the council. We had this contract in  place, and I was working on it. I was supposed to have help. It   s an 18     by 24   , eighteen foot tall by twenty-four foot wide, mural. It   s the  history of our Ponca people, so I did the research. I took what stories I  had. I   d visit with one of my elders who was in Bethany at the time, to  study, not to study but to learn and to hear stories about our people and  what would be best to express. He was really my greatest mentor for  this piece. With that, I worked on this piece. Supposed to have help. My  help never came through for me. My mom was like,    Well, that   s tough.  You get the whole contract then.    I said,    Okay, cool.    I was working  on it when I could, driving the miles, staying up there.  It was really hard to put a time frame on when I was going to finish it, I  just knew I was going to finish it. It got to a point where it   s getting  close to being finished but not quite, but then they have tribal elections,  and a new council gets voted in. The way our politics are set up is we  have a council, business council of seven members. Once four have the  same agenda, they have the quorum. So you got these four new people  in there that had all the same agenda, and that was to get the previous  council out of there. Out with the old, in with the new, so there went my  contract. It was being paid to me in four installments. I had three  installments. When this new council went in, I went and sat before them  a couple weeks after this transitional period and said,    Well, can I  continue working on this? I can draw up a new contract if you want.  This is how much left owed to me on this.     The new chairperson that they voted in,    Brent, I don   t know,    he says.     You said that you wanted to do this for the people, and you wanted to  do this for future generations like your children and their children.    He  says,    I really appreciate that, and I think you should do that but do it  for free.    (Laughs) I   m like,    Okay.    My cousin, she, luckily, was on  the council, too, at that time, but she tried to take up for me. She says,     That   s good, but I   ll have you know that Brent, what he   s charging per  square foot   normally those 12    by 12    paintings he sells are like four  hundred fifty, five hundred bucks.    She threw that out there, which is  true in some instances. For fundraisers and things like that, it can go as  high as five hundred bucks for a 12    by 12   . What I was charging them  20  was, like, seventy-five dollars a square foot, something like that,  something real affordable, right?  Then he said do it for free, and she tried to take up for me. Then he said,     We just don   t have the money. When it comes down to it, Brent, we  don   t have the money, so if you could think about doing it for free, you  can work on it,    and blah, blah, blah. In my mind, I didn   t say it, but I  was like,    You know what? You also said on your platform you wanted  to serve your people and do for your people. Why don   t you serve your  people for free? Why don   t you sit in your position where you   re at as  our chairman, and why don   t you do that for free, okay? Why am I any  different? Is it because I   m an artist, and you think just because we can  paint we should do this for free? That   s my vocation, in a way. I   m  coming up here. It costs money for gas, costs money for food, costs  money for these supplies, and my time. Just like your time is being  spent to govern our tribe, and honestly I don   t know what you   re doing,  but   .    (Laughs)  You don   t have to leave that in there because I   m about to get political   (Laughter) No, I   m just kidding. Anyway, I left it at that. I bit my  tongue. I didn   t say that, but I thought that. Anyway, I went and worked  on it probably several months after that, but it got to a point where  financially it wasn   t feasible for me to keep going up there. I said,    I  need to get another grant or something to finish this up so I can get  some more supplies and then clear-coat it.    What   s cool about the  Chickasaws is they said they would come up there and photograph it for  me with a panoramic and whatever. They would set the lights up and  everything and photograph it. They said,    Once you get that finished,  let us know. We   ll come up here and shoot it for you.     Little Thunder Great.  Greenwood Anyway, that   s even more incentive for me to get it done, too. So that   s  one. The other project is one I   m currently working on and about to  finish up, and that   s with the Chickasaws. It was mentoring some youth  with a mural project I have down in Tishomingo. That one   s at the  refuge, National Wildlife Refuge. There   s an outlook building there,  and they wanted a history of the area prior to the refuge, prior to when it  became a refuge. I did the research. There again, did research, presented  my idea, and mentored several youth over this past summer 2014 and  worked on it. That was challenging, too, because I had one student that  I mentored, she was like a true artist. I could sketch out something, the  composition, and she could do it. I didn   t have to go back,    Okay, I   m  going touch this up or touch that up.     21  A couple of my students, I drew things out for them, and it was,    Okay,  yeah. Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay,    and they   d just talk. I   m advocating,     Paint outside the lines, man  Step outside that box,    but if I   m actually  sketching something, there   s some times you got to paint within the  lines and follow a design. They said they weren   t painters, so that  mentoring project was fun, but also at times I wanted to go,    Oh, man, I  could   ve been done with this part by now. I   m going to have to go back  and touch it up.    Anyway, all of it aside, that process was great. I got to  mentor some young people     Little Thunder Right, what a great opportunity.  Greenwood    work with a great artist who, she just, lights out, she can draw  anything that you put in front of her. Just from memory what she can do  is amazing. She   s going to really go far in art. She   s already trying to  challenge me. She says,    Hey, next year I   ll be eighteen, so I   ll be in  your category.    I said,    That   s fine. Bring it     That   s what   s great when  you can really push young people     Little Thunder Right, when you find they   re talented.  Greenwood    to do more and be better than I was or I am.  Little Thunder That   s very cool. One of your paintings was on the cover of the  Oklahoma Native Tourism Guide. You remember how that came about?  Greenwood Yeah, that piece was commissioned. The cool thing about commission  works   they used to scare me to death because I was like,    Oh, my  God   .    I would need to paint to my vision, not someone else   s. I  always felt that was like taking away from what I wanted to do, my  creative side, but it   s really not because I realize the commissions have  come now that they see what I do. They like my style, so they give me  free rein on what to do. They give me their ideas, and I   m like,    That   s  not so hard.    If I take their ideas and interpret it through my means of  expressing this or that or whatever, and tie that cultural aspect into it,  that   s what they want. That   s what   s been cool about the commissions I  have received is that they like my style, so it makes it easy for me to  paint what they want. I focus on pulling out those elements that they  request.  For the tourism guide, they wanted to focus on tribal peoples. They  wanted to focus on the state itself, and breaking it up into tourism areas,  as well as incorporating elements of Oklahoma. That   s what I did. I  took those ideas. They didn   t tell me how to sketch it out or tell me  what to paint. They told me what they wanted, and then how I  interpreted that is what you saw on the tourism guide. What   s cool is  22  that as the painting took shape, it   s cool how all these things came  together. I wanted to incorporate rose rocks, Oklahoma stuff,  scissortails, rose rocks, the red dirt, our tribal entities, and different  representations of tribal entities, so it went all Plains, feathers, you saw  Eastern, like the feathered cap, skullcap, (I say skullcap) caps, or  whatever, and the turbans.  You saw all this mix of tribal people, and it showed the range of who  we are today. We   re not all buckskin and feathers. That   s definitely a  part of it, but there   s also this side of it and this side of it. It shows the  diversity of our people. That   s what I wanted to illustrate and  incorporate some other designs, Southeastern designs like cattle designs  and stuff like that. Anyway, I just took what we brainstormed about.  That   s the way I approach my commissions. If I get a commission, I  take my sketchbook, I go and sit down and visit with the person, and  see what they want. Then from there I start doing my research and  provide a blueprint, so to speak. Then they say,    Yeah, we like this. Can  we have a little more of this? A little more of that?    Then I go forward.  Little Thunder How much of your work is commissions right now, do you think?  Greenwood It   s still probably like a third.  Little Thunder A third? That   s good.  Greenwood Yeah, and two of the pieces that sometimes aren   t always  commissioned, I get asked to use them for conferences. I   m going to be  going out to San Diego for a wellness conference, and they want  something dealing with healing. Just so happens, I finished this piece  called Alikchi,    the healer    in Chickasaw, which was a piece at the  Kramer School of Nursing at Oklahoma City University. That   s what   s  cool is I still have rights to that image; I still own that image. They own  the painting, obviously, (they commissioned me for it) but the piece  really spoke to that conference. I said,    That   d be perfect for it,    and  they liked it, too, for the wellness conference. They used that image.  With that it   s kind of cool because when you get picked up for a  conference like that, (well, you know) usually they give you a hotel  room, an exhibitor space, and an honorarium, so I got that. Looking  forward to going to San Diego   Little Thunder Yeah, that   ll be wonderful. So what   s been one of the most   one of your  best honors, do you think, up to this point?  Greenwood Definitely, hands down, it   s got to be the honor that my wife and I  received for being Parents of the Year. That happened in 2009. The  National Indian Education Association selected us. We won the  23  Oklahoma Indian Parents of the Year in 2008 and was like,    Man,  how   d we do that?    (Laughter) That put us up for running for the  national honor. What   s cool, too, about that is at that time for NIEA,  they had always selected one parent. It was called Parent of the Year.  My wife and I, we were the first to be nominated as Parents, so we set a  precedent after that. I think the year after that a Crow couple won. I  think there may be another couple that won since then, but to me, I was  like,    Wow, it   s always just been    parent   ?    To me, parenting goes  hand-in-hand, and sometimes it takes a village to raise your family. It  hasn   t been just us; I just don   t credit us.  We   ve had good support from my parents, my wife   s family, as well.  My son always says,    It   s just because we   re awesome kids. That   s why  y   all got nominated, right?    (Laughter) Another funny thing to that, too,  when we won I think my kids   this is like, what, 2009. Five years ago  my son was thirteen; my daughter was ten, respectively. They were  about that age. When I won, we   re being congratulated and everything,  and this guy says,    Oh, congratulations.    He says,    How old are your  kids?    I said,    Fourteen and eleven,    thirteen and ten, whatever. He  said,    Oh, okay. I was really going to be impressed if they were  teenagers and you won this.    (Laughter) He said,    Wait until they   re  teenagers.    I said,    Oh, okay, thanks a lot.    I can see what he means  now. It   s challenging. He said,    Yeah, wait until they   re teenagers.     (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s great.  Greenwood I was trying to keep my answers short as possible, but once I start  talking, I have to cut myself off. My wife tells me I talk too much, so  you will edit this right?  Little Thunder No. (Laughs)  Greenwood Only certain things that I want cut out.  Little Thunder It   s all good.  Greenwood Okay.  Little Thunder Okay, I   d like to talk about your creative process and techniques a little  bit. You work mostly in acrylics on canvas or board, I think. What do  you like about that format?  Greenwood Well, I work more on paper. I don   t work on board necessarily.  Little Thunder Oh, okay.  24  Greenwood It   s paper, so I can incorporate the drawing aspect of what I do. I still  find myself wanting to draw. I incorporate the drawing and then go  back in with some paint. That mixed media aspect, I like that. The  majority of my works are primarily acrylics on canvas. I like a lot of  texture. I like color, obviously. The texture, a lot of times, I   ll use rice  paper. I like rice paper. If I want to create texture for clouds and things  like that, I   ll use rice paper, or I   ll use a gel medium for textures in  clothing to kind of see folds or ripples. What I do is I   ll sketch things  out in charcoal, then I   ll get my gel medium and start going with the  form and whatever. I like doing that. Sometimes I   ll use the coarse  pumice gel for dirt or landscape. I like a lot of texture, so you see that,  and obviously collage. I   ll collage papers, and I   ve used fabric.  Especially on some of my pieces that are referencing ledger art, I   ll use  papers. You can see all the papers in the background.  Little Thunder Right, right.  Greenwood I got all these papers I like using for shirts.  Little Thunder Cool-looking papers, yeah.  Greenwood I like collecting different papers to use for shirt designs and things like  that. I like using a wide variety of things. Acrylic on canvas is my  primary medium.  Little Thunder Yeah, I love the care that you put into the clothing when you paint, you  know, depicting clothing. It gets as much love and attention as the rest  of the composition.  Greenwood Thanks. Like I say, I enjoy it.  Little Thunder Do you think it comes from also being a dancer, your background?  Greenwood Yeah, that helps. I mean, a lot of times I   m having to pose, too, for it.  Little Thunder Oh, you are?  Greenwood Yeah, if I want a certain fold in a shirt, I pull out my Indian shirts, and  I   ll put them on, and I   ll be in front of the mirror, posing or taking  pictures of myself. (Laughter)  Little Thunder And taking a picture? Okay.  Greenwood Yeah. Those are the only selfies I do. (Laughs) All these young people  take selfies these days. I do it for artful purposes, and that   s it.  25  Sometimes I just want to get those folds. Everything doesn   t have to be  exactly the way it is known. I like to get a certain fold, and then from  that it helps me in future paintings. I did it so I know how to do it again,  so I   m going to create these folds in the shirt. Even for this piece here, I  probably put on this shirt. I had a photo to reference, but sometimes  those photos are grainy and old. I need to see how the shirt would look  for real, so I   ll put on a shirt and get those folds just right and sketch  them out. Then you know for some of my figurative pieces, too, I   ll  have my son or my wife or my daughter model.    Can you hold your  hand out like this,    or,    Can you stand like this?    (Laughs) They serve  as my models sometimes, too.  Little Thunder You   ll be sketching, or will you take a photograph, or both?  Greenwood Both. Yeah, I usually take a photo for reference because they go,  (Sighs). (Laughs) I don   t want to have them stand there forever, so I   ll  sketch them out real quick. I   ll take a photo, then I   ll sketch it out real  quick, then I   ll go back to the photo and touch up.  Little Thunder What other kinds of research do you do aside from sketching and  photographs?  Greenwood I used to read books a lot, I guess from school, just to get more  knowledge and information. I think it hasn   t happened as much because  I started painting from a place of knowing. These stories, our stories of  like Ponca for instance, our tradition is told in the songs, and I   ve  interpreted that into paintings. I   ve taken things that my elders have  expressed to me. It could   ve been a humorous story, or it could   ve been  a teaching about how the Native American hand game came to be,  whatever. It could   ve been something as complex or as simple as that.  It   s just researching first-hand, try to get the information firsthand, and  then reading. Like I said, I need to do more reading. I haven   t done as  much here lately because I always had the people I needed to talk to  here with me. That   s how I would get a lot of my information, then  recollection of stories and things I grew up hearing.  Little Thunder How about titles for your paintings?  Greenwood Usually the title happens before, and I paint to that. It   s probably about  fifty-fifty now. Used to be, always the title came first because that was  the idea.    Okay, cool, I like that phrase.    The title would pop in my  head.    I   m going to paint something to that title.    Now it   s fifty-fifty,  like this piece back here, the three pieces that was actually inspired  from a piece I did for Indian Market like in 2004 or    5, around that time  frame. It was one of those pieces where I took it to Santa Fe and worked  on it in the hotel room. I didn   t get any professional photos made of it,  26  and I sold it that weekend, so all I have is a 4    by 5    glossy photo of it.  That   s it. It was never professionally shot or anything. Someone had  saw that, they liked it, and they wanted me to reproduce that for a  commission piece for a festival.  I said,    I can do that,    with the same style. Definitely won   t use the  same kind of composition. I did it in the way as far as the figurative  women, but then I used different elements to represent different styles  of women, clothing. Then the elk   s teeth, that   s kind of like three-dimensional  element I like to add. Sometimes I will add horsehair or  shells or elk   s teeth just to add that Native element. I like to do that, too.  Like I said, I like to experiment. I like to have fun with art. Just to  always have to be steady, 2-D easel painting, I like to experiment,  therefore I use papers, material, rice paper, what have you, incorporate  drawing and painting, charcoal, in this case elk   s teeth. I like to keep it  fresh and keep the ideas a fresh approach to what I do, relying on that  traditional elements.  Little Thunder What is your creative process once you get an idea?  Greenwood What   s been kind of cool here lately is I   ve done more live paints here  of late. Seems like that   s becoming a popular   . It   s taking on more  popularity now. People like to see that process. I think it   s really cool as  an artist to be able to engage with a audience and for them to see that  process. Sometimes it   s not even about me finishing a piece, although  that   s my goal. (Laughs) Sometimes I like for them to see the process  and what happens during that process. It   s like action painting. It   s  really into it, like (imitates brush stroke sound). I think that   s what   s  cool about live painting is people seeing the process and are able to  engage on a certain level with that and connecting. That   s talking about  live painting, but getting back to my regular pieces, what was the  question again?  Little Thunder Your creative process once you get an idea.  Greenwood Once I get an idea. In a way it seems kind of formal, I think, because I  do, when I get an idea, I sketch it out.  Little Thunder You do, and you keep it in a notebook too?  Greenwood I have sketchbooks, yeah. For instance, I just did a piece for a  fundraiser for the Five Civilized Tribes Museum. It was called Rock  Your Mocs, and it was just paintings on shoes, blank shoes. I kind of  knew what I wanted to do, but you always don   t know if it   s going to  work. I have to sketch it out, and then I play around with it.    Okay, this  works. This doesn   t,    until finally you come to a point,    This will look  27  cool.    So you go with that. I wanted to do butterflies. I had to sketch  out      How are we going to do these butterfly wings on these shoes?    I  sketched it out to get it the way I wanted, and then it took a shape of its  own, came to life. That   s the way it is in a lot of paintings. I sketch out  what I want to do first. There   s this ledger piece that I   m working on,  and before I even mess up my ledger paper (Laughter) because I know  ledger paper is old, I   m going to sketch it out first the way I want it.  Then I   ll use this as my model to get this design onto my ledger paper.  I always have to sketch it out first so I can get it just how I want it.  When it comes to, especially, my figurative pieces, all the other stuff  happening in the background, the color, I want that stuff to be real  loose, the way the color blends with one another. Then my figurative  pieces, I start tying things in a little bit more, but it all starts out with a  sketch. Too, as you well know, sometimes what you see initially  doesn   t always end up the way you think it will. That   s what   s cool  about it, too. Sometimes it morphs into something else. It evolves. It  changes. One of my influences (he really is a great influence on what I  do) is Mark Rothko. I always appreciated his approach and how he was  as engaged with his work as people that saw it. Whatever they felt, it  was like they were in that place with him at that time, even though he  wasn   t there physically with them. It   s whatever he was doing in his  pieces, it transcended beyond him because people really   .  It   s taken me on a journey, his palette and particularly his paintings of  what they call color-filled paintings, which aren   t really color-filled  paintings but those abstract pieces. He wanted the viewer to be evoked  by something that they saw. That   s what my approach is. If they can   t  engage,    He can   t really paint faces,    if that   s what they think, cool, but  if there   s something else in there that can get them, maybe my color  usage and the way I combine these colors, that   s what I want to get  them so they can appreciate the fact that I   m working with shadows, not  so much eyelids, a mouth, a nose. I want that color palette to tie  everything in together for them. My process, the point I   m getting to, is  that during my process, the closer it is for my painting to start   as it  takes shape and starts to finish up, I have to sit there and just look at it. I  heard Rothko would sit in front of his painting for hours, just looking at  it.  I don   t take that long, (Laughter) but I might sit in front of it for ten  minutes or fifteen minutes, looking at it and seeing,    How is this  speaking to me as an artist? Do I need to work on this more? Do I need  to move over here?    I become really engaged, and that   s what   s really  cool about it is that I realize the closer I am to finishing a piece, the  more it draws me in and the more I see myself sitting back and looking  at it, stepping away and just looking. That   s what   s cool about art. It   s  28  hard to explain sometimes. I can do that when I see someone   s work I  really do admire, to see their process and see where they were at when  they created this one area. It puts me in my place of engagement, you  know. That   s part of my process, too, that I really do like and try to  transcend even what I do so that when it   s in front of a total stranger,  they get engaged. They can see that point in time, maybe, where I was  working on this and,    Oh, there   s so much to this. This area really  speaks to me.    Maybe they can feel that, too.  Little Thunder Right.  Greenwood That   s what, during the process, I want my work, in a way, to have that  same kind of feeling and reaction from people.  Little Thunder Can you talk about your signature a little bit? Pretty straightforward?  Greenwood Yeah. It   s funny, when I first started   . That was a funny thing: How  do you really develop a signature, right? First of all, my penmanship is  crappy. (Laughter) I can   t write penmanship for nothing. I guess I could  when I was younger, but it was too structured. Then as I got older, I  don   t know if it   s part of being lazy or whatever, but it was always too  tight. As I got into college and stuff, when it came down to my  signature, it was pretty simple at first. Then, probably like a lot of  artists, I started working on it. I start trying to work on a signature. I  look all these artists    nice signatures.    Okay, I need to work on mine,  too.    In the beginning it was totally illegible. Just like bunch of  scribbles (mimics scribbling noise). You could see a B, but then it was a  bunch of up-and-down lines. You could see a G, then it was a bunch of  up-and-down lines.  Even that started to mature, and then I started getting really, putting R,  E, and T. Still had this up-and-down structure, but yet there was still a  little more definition to it, a little more, I don   t want to say sensibility  about it but it started taking shape. It became more artsy to kind of  (mimics swooshing sound) instead of being,    Ah     and crazy. Not to  say that those simple signatures like some artists have where it   s maybe  a couple lines, even those quick marks, there   s something about that  that   s really,    That   s an awesome signature,    to have something simple  like that. Mine   s pretty straightforward:    Brent Greenwood.     Sometimes it   s    B. Greenwood.    Sometimes it   s just    Brent.    It all  depends on the size of the piece and where I want to put it. Sometimes I  sign it on the left; sometimes it   s on the right. Sometimes it   s up,  vertical. Sometimes it   s on the side.  What I didn   t want to do, however I signed it, I didn   t want it to take  away from my piece. I know some artists have said because of that,  29  they   ll sign the back only. I   ll sign the back, too, but I want my  signature to be somewhere on there, but if it takes away from the piece  itself, I   m not going to put it on there. I   ll put it on the side, at least.  Whenever I use my signature, I   ll usually use a color that   s in the  painting too, same kind of color. I   ll put it in a place that   s subtle, that   s  real subtle, but yet it   s still there because I don   t want it to take away  from everything else happening. I could   ve just put it up there in nice  big brown letters, but to me it would take away from this whole thing  happening. I still want it in there, but I want it to be subtle, not to take  away from anything else happening in the piece.  Little Thunder You have many more years to paint, but I am wondering so far, looking  back, what was an important fork in the road when you could   ve gone  one way and you chose to go this other way?  Greenwood I think I mentioned that in the sense of when I look back, it was  probably that Red Earth rejection. I really could   ve started going this  other direction of painting faces and doing whatever. Then luckily my  wife kind of headed me off at the pass. Said,    Nope, don   t do that.    I  guess I have her to thank for me continuing to do what I do in that sense  with the painting and staying true to who I was as an artist. That was  probably one major fork. The other has been the challenge of  maintaining a job to pay the bills as well as be an artist. Many nights  I   ve been staying up all night, and I go to work. I don   t need to be doing  that. It   s tough. You know deadlines. You got to meet your deadlines.  It   s like having another job on top of your full-time job, so that was a  challenge. In a sense to where at times I   d be lying if I didn   t say I  didn   t want to give up. There   s times I say,    It   s just easier. Can I make  this a true hobby and do it whenever I want and put it away for a while?  Can I just go play golf?    I don   t play golf, (Laughs) but that was going  to give me a chance to.    Can I just   .    I don   t want to say    be like  everybody else,    but,    Can I just come home and have a beer and watch  football, whatever?    (Laughs)  That would be the easy way out. My friend, rest in peace, Dan  Lomahaftewa, we shared some gallery time together. He said,    Being  an artist isn   t easy.    He said,    You know what? It   s not.    I   ve heard that  being an artist, being Indian   s not easy because being Indian, too,  you   re having to juggle your obligations of your culture. First and  foremost, really, you   re always going to be Indian and who you are. At  the same time, you got to provide for your family, got to put a roof over  your head, food on the table, clothes on their back. You have to have a  way to make ends meet. Singing at powwows or just trying to live on  your artwork sometimes, for me, it was feast or famine. I just couldn   t  see myself doing it. I was like,    Man, it would just be easier to get up at  six a.m. and go to work and come home and know I had a paycheck  30  coming in.    The post office is a good paycheck, but after so long of  doing that, some years of doing that, nineteen years of doing that, I  realized that   s not what I want.  I didn   t feel like I was fulfilling my duty as an artist because I was  always going to be an artist. I try to take it easy, but it   s always calling  me back. I   m always coming back to it. I can take a break real easy. I  can take a break, but I always end up getting back into it one way or the  other. Sometimes I have had, it   s like writer   s block. I   ve had a creative  block where I just don   t feel like doing nothing. I could see myself at  that time. It   s because I was coming home from work at the post office,  so tired, so drained that I didn   t feel doing anything. I didn   t feel like  doing art. Days can turn into weeks real quick, but, like I said,  something was always calling me back in the studio to get back to  work. I just know I never could put it away, so that   s why I said,    It   s  really picking up. I   m really staying busy with it now. I need to focus  on getting closer to home and doing this more.    Even though it   s my  part-time job, it is my primary source of income. I enjoy that, the  flexibility I have to be able to do what I do, and people enjoy it, too.  I guess, in short, I feel really blessed to be able to do what I   m doing,  like anyone that is a musician or an actor and gets paid to do what they  love to do. It   s a awesome feeling. Even working at Indian Education  right now, I   m very fulfilled at what I do, helping the students, helping  them with cultural enrichment, helping them stay on top of their grades.  Sometimes I   m like,    I get paid to do this?    because it   s what I know.  I   m a advocate for education, higher education. I   m a advocate for the  arts and our culture, especially culture. I want our kids up here, our  Indian Education kids   because this is a urban setting. I know not all of  them are in tune or aware of that, but I want to make it as available as  much possible to teach them, to help them. Not teach them, but help  them be aware of,    You know what? You   re Chickasaw. You   re  Arapaho. You   re not just Native American. You have a people; you  have a culture, a tribe. You have these ceremonies, these dances. We do  things in an intertribal sense. Come do this with us.    I   ve been teaching  some little small artwork shops for the students, working with them  here and there. It   s been great. That   s where I feel like I   m at. I feel  very fulfilled and able to continue to do what I do.  Little Thunder Is there anything else you   d like to add or we haven   t covered before we  look at your artwork?  Greenwood No, I think I   ve talked enough. I just think it all comes from a place of  knowing. I don   t paint anything that I don   t feel like I haven   t  researched. Obviously, I   m going to look up, I   m going to study what  I   m painting, what I   m wanting to portray. I do reference photos from  31  different things, mainly for poses and things like that, but I don   t paint  to mimic. I don   t paint to copy this photo or that photo. Some of my  wildlife pieces, I   ll reference photos, but then I got to make it more  impressionistic, and I got to do this or that to it because I don   t ever  want it to be just like someone   s photo or other piece of interpretive  work. Even though it is a photograph, it   s someone else   s thought and  idea.  That   s the way they decide to shoot that image, right? I   m just going to  reference it. I   m not going to copy it. I don   t know. I like to say that  because that   s what I try to teach the kids I mentor. I teach at the  Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy, too, which is now the Chickasaw  Arts Academy because it   s going to be an ongoing thing throughout the  year. That   s one of the things I tell them. You can reference photos but  make it your own. That   s where the creative side, that creative nature   s  going to come out. The artistic side of you is really going to come out.  Reference it but then make it your own, your own interpretation. How  you take it in here and how it comes up through here, it   s got to be you.  That   s what I try to impress upon them because that   s what I do.  Anyway, that   s where I   m coming from as an artist.  Little Thunder Okay. Well, we   ll take a look at your paintings real quick.  Greenwood Okay.  Little Thunder Okay, Brent, would you like to tell us a little bit about this painting?  32  Greenwood Yes, this piece is called Bringing Up the Sun. It   s really become kind of  a signature piece of mine. It   s used widely throughout the Chickasaw  Nation. It   s cool how art sometimes tends to fall into place for you and  happen the way it does. What I wanted to do with this piece was,  obviously, express the Stomp Dance. The way I did it was I wanted to  show the energy, the movement, and the style of the dancer. What I did  was I had these Southeastern-style motifs, like the scrollwork design  happening. I   ve seen that throughout different artifacts and things, but I  wanted to interpret it into another way instead of just being typical,     Okay, we can put this simple scrollwork design.    Like I told you  earlier, looking at it but then reinterpreting it in my own way.  I put this here as a design element. For people, it   s become smoke of the  fire; it   s become dust from the stomp dancer. That   s cool because  they   ve interpreted it as that, so I   ve let them, however they want to see  it. I want it to be a simple design. Anyway, with that I incorporated  these sun circles in the background. The sun circles, to me, the way  these ended up, it reads from left to right. I didn   t even plan this. I liked  these particular sun circles and the movement of them, so I put them on  here. After I got them on here, I   m like,    Wow, that really does have,  like, a flow.    To me, this one on the left, represents the morning star  right here, the sun, how it begins to come up so you can see some of  these sun rays.  Then we move over to the next one. To me, that   s like broad daylight.  You   ve got the sun; you   ve got the bright white of the sun. Then it  transitions into night, so you   ve got this whirlwind or this spiral design.  You see night and day until you ultimately end up on the far right, and  you   ve got this crescent moon. You   ve got a total nighttime sun circle,  so to speak. There   s a lot of underpainting happening in this. I wanted  the warm colors of the fire to be evident. That   s why you see this nice  warm tones and the stars, obviously, but then I got this magenta  happening. Like I said, I always have two or three colors of red or  magenta, of oranges, of yellows working, so as I   m painting, I can  blend them onto my canvas. I work with three or four different colors at  a time. It   s never one color straight out the tube and then try to blend  with another one onto my palette. To make one color, I create that  blending effect on my canvas with the colors, the two or three colors.  Anyway, this one   s called Bringing Up the Sun.  Little Thunder That   s neat. How about this piece?  33  Greenwood This piece, I saw this photo. There   s this photo that really stood out to  me of this   . My wife, like I said, she   s a graphic designer, so she  always puts together these calendars for her tribe. In this one particular  picture, she had this Otoe man painting all these designs on the side of a  tipi. That got to me in a way. The message for me, that I got from it,  was that we   re still doing our thing in the traditional sense by telling our  stories, the traditional stories, representing our traditional designs and  motifs, but we   re doing it in a modern sense with a modern sensibility  of design and materials. I took the idea of the man painting the tipi,  except  instead  of him painting typical ledger-style horses or marks,  he   s got more of a graffiti-esque design element going on. But within  this, there   s still elements of symbolism that are Native. I got the  handprint, which in turn when I put this on there, I totally saw a buffalo  head. I put those eyeballs in there, so there   s a buffalo head in there.  There   s this horse design and these designs right here are like  hoofmarks, hoof prints. Then you got the crescent moon, star, cross,  what have you, and that   s like a leaf pattern. There   s all these traditional  elements of design but yet done in contemporary sense. Like I said, he   s  still got the typical, kind of an old, maybe a stick, whatever, that   s  dipped in paint that he   s using, but yet you got this graffiti-style stuff  happening, real modern elements. The color combinations is kind of  graffiti-esque, too. Everything else   this is typical of a Otoe floral  pattern and the style of beadwork. The Otoe beadwork is notable  because everything is outlined in white beads. That   s why I wanted to  make sure I referenced that. It wasn   t actually a pattern that was on the  man itself, but I took that pattern from something else that was Otoe  and incorporated it into my own to come up with this design.  34  I kept my background real soft and kind of subtle. I always like things  that have a subtlety to it when it comes to my landscapes, almost kind  of like a romantic style of painting in a way, but then you got this other  real,    in your face, here it is, it   s coming at you.    This particular piece  is called Old Man Wild Style (Laughter) because of this graffiti. There   s  a style of graffiti that is called Wild Style. Just by calling it Old Man  Wild Style   we sometimes reference our elderly people when we say,     old man.    We might say,    Old Man So and So,    or,    Old Man This  Guy.    It   s so weird talking about the elders. This is like conveying  those thoughts of the traditional, yet we   re using new elements,  materials, and new interpretations of who we are and what we are as far  as symbolism and how it   s speaking to a new generation of artists.  Little Thunder All right, how about this painting?  Greenwood This piece is referencing the strength of the woman and the importance  of her in our life, the giver of life for us, the bearer of our children. This  piece is actually called Native Sisters. I wanted to just reference the  different style of Indian women with different tribal elements, but yet  we   re all connected. We   re all Indian. We   re all Native. Like my wife  and her best friends, they call each other sister girls. Indian way, when  you take on an Indian friend, they   re your friend for life. I saw this as  35  speaking to that idea, so that   s why I called it Native Sisters. They   re all  connected, they   re sisters, yet they   re different tribes, but yet they   re  still connected in that way. The strength of the woman, the status of the  woman is expressed up here with the elk   s teeth because if there was a  lot of elk   s teeth (even though none of these women have elk   s teeth on  their dress) I   m still referencing that thought or that idea that that was  kind of a status symbol. The more highly you were thought of, the more  special you were if you had a lot of elk   s teeth on your dress. It was a  status symbol. This one, too, the background and everything takes a  Rothko-esque type of painting approach. That   s kind of what I wanted  to express with this piece. The bottom line is the subject matter of the  Native sisters and that whole idea.  Little Thunder Right. I really like that one.  Greenwood This is the first time I really portrayed   this is taken from ledger style.  It   s the first time I   ve portrayed a Southeastern-style woman or figure in  this sense. It   s not typical ledger to see Southeastern style of art in that  sense. I might be contradicting myself in a small sense because I said I  don   t cross the two, but in this sense it   s different. It   s more of a  interpretation of this style, yet it   s done in totally Southeastern-style  clothing, although you see the style of ledger it   s still interpreting. I  don   t know if I   m making sense. (Laughter) I   m trying not to confuse as  to say   .  Little Thunder Well, it   s a record, yeah.  Greenwood Yeah, it   s the record     Little Thunder Record of the Southeastern.  Greenwood    yeah. It   s done in a ledger style     Little Thunder Right.  Greenwood    but not to confuse, it   s not ledger art. (Laughter) It   s influenced by  ledger, but it   s not ledger art. I   ll just leave it at that.  Little Thunder Okay, here we   re looking at your hummingbird piece. Want to tell us  about this a little bit?  36  Greenwood This is a black-chinned hummingbird. With this piece, I wanted to  create movement. I had Southeastern style of motifs in mind. You see  that zigzag pattern? To me, I could see that hummingbird flying all over  the place, so that represents movement. There again, like in Bringing  Up the Sun where I had like those scroll designs, I used them again to  represent the movement of wind, air with its wings. That   s what that  represents in this one. This one   s a straightforward kind of piece.  Sometimes you just   .  Little Thunder It looks like   is it two canvases?  Greenwood Yeah, another thing is I like to paint on thicker canvases. One of my  friends had did this before, and I said,    Hey, I got some thin canvases I  want to,    not get rid of, but I could use them, so I ended up putting  together two small canvases to make a thick one     Little Thunder I see. Yeah, that   s cool.  Greenwood    just because I like the thicker ones. But this one is straightforward.  It   s just sometimes I have a hankering to paint a hummingbird, just to  do it, so that   s why I did. I   ve done a couple of hummingbirds now, and  37  I   ve done butterflies, and hummingbirds. We have a book on insects, so  I   ll reference that for butterflies. That was a black-chinned  hummingbird.  Little Thunder Thank you very much for your time today, Brent.  Greenwood Thanks, it was great   -------  -------
