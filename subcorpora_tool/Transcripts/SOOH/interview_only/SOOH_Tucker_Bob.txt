 L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  Today is April 22, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University. I   m here out in the country near Hess, Oklahoma, and I   m  interviewing Bob Tucker today, here at his home. Randy Wilson is also  joining us and might chime in a little bit. So, Bob, thank you for talking  with me today.  You   re welcome.  Could you tell me when and where you were born?  I was born two miles east, a mile and three quarters south of Hess and  then a half mile back east from there, right on the river.  And was that at home?  Yes.  Did you have siblings at the time, brothers and sisters that were     Seven.  Were you the youngest, the last child?  Yes.  What was the house like?  You could throw a cat through the wall. (Laughs) It was pretty raggedy.  Did you share bedrooms and beds with your brothers and sisters,  always?  5  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  R. Tucker  L. Wilson  R. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Oh, yes. Yes. We had a big screened porch on the south side of that  house, and Daddy would put ducking around the outside in the winter.  Then in the summer, he   d take that ducking down and put it on the  inside and put boots on it where you could hang it up and the wind could  blow in there. It   s got a screen on it that     That ducking was about like canvas or cotton sack material?  Yes. That   s what you made cotton sacks out of. That   s what it was.  What were your mom and dad   s names?  Wiley Osborne Tucker and Katie Ann Tucker.  And her maiden name was?  Mayo.  And what did they do for a living?  Daddy farmed, and Mama took care of all of us kids. She worked in the  field.  What kind of crops?  Cotton and wheat. Mostly cotton, and then you had to raise milo and  corn and stuff for the horses to get by.  And how did your parents come to this area? Were they from here?  Daddy was born a half mile north of there. He was born a half mile north  of where we was raised, and he lived in two states, two counties, and  never moved but a half mile from where he was born.  So Texas and Oklahoma?  Texas and Oklahoma. This was Texas then,  Greer  County, Texas. And  then they made a mistake. They was calling North Fork    Red River.     They decided that Red River went on up through there, and so that   s  whenever they took and put Oklahoma   Greer and Jackson County was  in Texas at one time, and then they made it in Oklahoma.  So now they call the river that they thought was the Red River     The North Fork of the Red River.  6  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  And did you grow up playing in that river?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I just lived 150 yards from it. There was some old  black people that worked for Granny and Granddad. They   d come over  there and get us and take you down there and teach you how to swim.  We grew up right there in that river.  Would the river get very deep?  Well, yes, it   d get deep. When it rained, yes, it   d get deep and half a  mile wide. We played in the edge of it then. It didn   t seem to make any  difference. (Laughs) We was little rats, I guess, down in that river.  So did you live in that house you were born in for quite a while?  Until    56, and then we built a new home.  Well, tell me about some of your chores growing up.  Some of my chores? Whatever they told you to do. You fed the  chickens. You went and got the cows out of the sudan patch when it was  time to milk. Just whatever. You done it.  Did your family have a big garden?  Oh, yes. We had a whale of a garden. If it sprinkled, Daddy made you  hoe them onions, take care of them onions.  Get the weeds out.  Oh yes, and loosen that ground in between them. Oh, yes. That garden,  that was the center point. Them old hens, you took   Daddy and Mama  would milk seven cows, twice a day, and they sold that cream in Altus.  Them eggs, we   d have a hundred laying hens there running loose. They  sold them eggs up there, what we didn   t eat. We could eat most of  everything that they had, but anything left over, we sold them in Altus.  Do you remember what they would bring?  No, no, I have no idea.  Did they drive a car to Altus?  Oh, yes.  7  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  What kind of car?  The first one I can remember, they had before that one, a green    42  Chevrolet. My uncle Tommy Mayo sold cars at Vernon. He come over  here and told Daddy, he said,    If you want a car, you better get it.    The  war had broke out. Said,    You better get that car because there won   t be  no more.    So Daddy run over there the next day, and Uncle Tommy sold  him a car. That was in    42. That old green car, it couldn   t go but thirty-five  miles an hour or something, but he drove it until, well, he drove it  seven years, I guess. Then he went to buying him a Mercury. He   d buy  one of them Mercurys every year. And then he got to buying  Oldsmobiles, the Super 88 Oldsmobiles. He   d buy one every year.  Did the kids get to go to town ever?  Oh, yes. Yes.  Would you all pile in the car, or just a few kids each time?  Just a few each time.  Was Altus the place to go?  Sometimes we   d go to Tipton.  Was Tipton pretty thriving in those days?  Yes, yes, yes. Back then it was. If you had any blacksmith work or  something like that, you   d have to sharpen plow tools, you   d go to  Tipton. Henry Hollis run that blacksmith over there and you   d go over  there.  What about Hess? Was it a pretty thriving community in the    40s?  Yes. We had two grocery stores and two filling stations. Had an  apartment building. I guess that was the first apartment complex they  had. (Laughs)  Where was that at?  Over near Wilt.  Oh, yes.  There was about three apartments there, and Mr. Shaw, he   d fill them up  and   no. It wasn   t Mr. Shaw. I can   t think of what that old fellow   s  8  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  name was. Anyway, he   d fill up them apartments when boll pulling time  come. He   d lease them apartments to the boll pullers.  How old were you when you started working in the cotton fields?  Soon as Mama could get you   when you   d get big enough to take.  What would you do?  They   d make you a sack out of a tow sack, and you   d pull cotton.  And fill up the sack?  Yes. The first thing that I can really remember doing, (I wasn   t very big,  either) Daddy bought that old Richie place over there, and Mama took a  tow sack a piece for me  and Jimmie Dan . Jimmie Dan got a ring off of  the barrels and put it in there and sewed that cotton sack up and put it on  her back. We would walk in that cotton field over where them girls were  when they was hoeing it. If they found a goat head, they   d hoe it and put  it in there, one of them goat heads with it. Daddy didn   t have goat heads,  and he made sure of that. If them girls found one, they hauled it to the  end, not let them fall off. We   d take a walk with them, and they   d put  them goat heads in them. When he bought that old place, it was solid  goat heads.  Cleaned them out, huh.  Yes, cleaned them out. You   d have to walk with them girls hoeing.  And the girls were all your sisters.  Yes.  And goat heads are stickers     Yes, yes.     and they   ll get you. (Laughs)  Yes. If you step on one of them, yes. (Laughs) Me and Jimmie Dan  could walk in that field barefooted, still.  How did your grandparents come to this area?  They come up here, Granddad and his daddy-in-law come up here in     87. They was down in Jacksboro, Texas, was where they   d come to.  9  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  Went back down there, and Granddad bought a two-room house. They  put it on a wagon, and here they came. Bogged that two-room house  down in the river, in Red River at Doan   s Crossing. They went back and  got it after they lived in a tent that summer and made a crop. They went  back and dug that wagon out and brought it on up here. I ain   t tough  enough for that.  So it stayed stuck for a while?  For the first year until they could put in a crop. And you know how  many roads there was in    87: none. They brought it from Jacksboro,  Texas, up here. That   s pretty tough.  Did they have women and children along for that ride?  Oh, sure they did. Yes. They just got in another wagon and kept coming,  I guess. Dad done come up here the year before and figured out where  they were going.  So was the land free at that time, or how did they claim land?  They just got up here, I guess, and settled on it. When Granddad got  pneumonia, he broke his hip, and they   d go and operate on him in  Oklahoma City. T. P. Sutton, my uncle, he went around getting people to  go up, them kids, to go up and donate blood. Little Cloyse Kirby,  orneriest little fellow there ever was, he said,    I don   t know why people  wants to give that old man blood. He killed Geronimo to get that land.     (Laughs) I don   t know. They just come up here. I guess it was free. I  don   t know what it was. Granddad settled on a half section there, and his  daddy-in-law settled on a half section there.  Judge Roberts?  Yes.  So you grew up near your grandparents? You saw them a lot?  Yes, they just lived a half mile over there where Albert and Lou lived.  Granny was always in the   when apricots and stuff come along, she   d  make them apricot pies, them fried pies. Man, they were good. We   d go  over there every day, where we could get some apricot pies. She liked to  make them pies. I don   t know why she liked to make apricot better. She  had all them peaches, but she   d rather make apricot pies. I guess she  liked them, too. I don   t know.  And this was Granny Tucker?  10  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Yes.  I   ve heard she was pretty good with her pistol?  Yes, she was good with a .22. She could shoot a rabbit. She was always  shooting them rabbits with a .22. Shoot anything that come along.  And then would she eat the rabbits?  I don   t know. I don   t remember eating any rabbits when we was kids.  We had all them chickens. We had them cows. They   d buy a hundred  little chickens. That was my job, to take care of them little chickens.  They   d get them in February. They   d buy a hundred of them, and you  had to eat them things before they got too big. That   s why I don   t eat  chicken now. I don   t eat chicken no more.  You had your share? (Laughs)  Yes, I think I did, because you   d have to eat a hundred chickens.  So do you have any good stories about your grandparents?  Oh, Granddad was getting old by the time I got old enough, but he   d  always want to sit and tell you old stories every time you   d go by over  there. Granny Tucker, Daddy would send us over there. Of course, it  was just a cotton field about half a mile. Christmas Eve, he tried to slip  in that house and see a Christmas Eve gift to Granny. Nope, you  couldn   t do it because she was watching to make sure somebody wasn   t  coming. It was a big deal, Christmas Eve gift. That was a big deal back  then.  She wanted to be the first one, or     Yes, I don   t know where it come from, but Daddy would go over and try  to pull that on Granny. Nope, you couldn   t do it.  What kind of gifts would they be?  Little truck or something like that. There wasn   t much money  circulating. Of course, it didn   t take a lot of money to buy something. I  know when I got a little wagon, they put it upstairs down there in that  old house. Of course, everybody knew about it. They went off and left  us all there at the house. Joyce would get to go to town, it seemed like,  every Saturday. The rest of us wouldn   t. But they took me up there and  let me ride in that wagon before Christmas. Mama was going to kill  11  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  them (Laughs) because they let me ride in that wagon. They showed me  what my Christmas gift was. (Laughter)  Sneak preview.  Yes. (Laughs)  What are some dishes that you remember your mom making, some food?  Fried chicken. (Laughter) I don   t know. She just cooked all the time.  Did you help her cook ever, or did the girls help her?  Well, the girls helped her. I was little. The girls helped. One time after  we got propane, butane at first, (they had those little old tanks that had to  be buried) we run out. Them girls, each one of them had a morning to  start breakfast, and Mother would have to get up and help. Well, we  didn   t have no butane. Didn   t have no coal cook stove. Just had the  butane cook stove. Daddy went out and washed outside, Mama did, and  the girls, on one of them rub boards. They had pots that they   d heat it in.  Daddy went out there and started that thing and put that grate over that  stuff where they could cook breakfast out there. Joyce would say,    I  know how the pioneers lived now.    (Laughter) But she   d cook breakfast  until we got butane.  What would you all do for entertainment?  Stay in the river. In the wintertime, we   d hunt and trap, us kids would.  We went to ball games. We went to basketball games in the winter.  For Tipton, or     Southside. Joyce was a pretty good   she   s a big old long, tall girl. She  was a pretty good basketball player. We never missed no game. I played  baseball from the time I was in fifth grade until I got out of school. I  don   t never remember walking on a baseball field or walking in a gym  that Mama and Daddy wasn   t there. Never. We just shut down to go to  ball games.  How old were you when you started going to school?  Well, I was in first grade. We didn   t have kindergarten.  How would you get there?  School bus.  12  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Erma Tucker  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  Who drove the school bus?  Oh, Clyde Lovett, Benny Ward     Just boys in high school, or were they older?  Oh, no, no, no. They was older. The school is closed now. Back then it  was two buses would come to Hess right around there, east and south of  Hess. Two buses to haul all them kids to school. Then they got where  the bus didn   t even run over here. They all moved. There was no one  there.  That school opened about the time you were born?  Thirty-nine. J.L. graduated with the first class, Tommy Tucker from the  last class.  Ninety-one.  Yes,    91. From    39 until    91. That   d be, what, fifty-two years.  So would you go to ball practice before or after school, or was it during  school?  Both. We liked to play ball.  Basketball, baseball, was there football?  No. I know in the summer, you   d be playing, and Daddy would say,     Now, you   ve got to get up and start.    The ball coach had been there the  day before telling him if you don   t start ball. He said,    You   ve got to get  that done because you   ve got to take off to go practice ball this  evening.    He made you get there in time. He didn   t let you miss ball  practice because he wanted to go to them ball games, I guess. (Laughter)  I don   t ever remember going to neither one that they wasn   t there. We   d  go to Norman to that tournament up there. They   d be there. They   d go  up and stay, get a motel room, stay as long as we played ball. One time  we went up there and thought,    Well, I don   t guess they   re coming.     Here comes Mama and Daddy and Ms. Kidd. They went and got Ms.  Kidd to come up there. They got a motel room, and they made every one  of them ball games.  Were there any other events around the area in which the community  would come together, like for Fourth of July picnic or something like  this?  13  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  No. Don   t remember that.  Would your family celebrate Fourth of July?  We didn   t plow or nothing that day. (Laughs) I guess that   s a  celebration.  That counts.  We had a big picnic at the house. The kids would come over there and  fire the firecrackers and stuff.  After they left home and got married, they   d come back for Fourth of  July. Fern and Preston come every holiday. That Swift Independent  Meat Company shut down that day, they was here. I don   t care if they  lived in El Paso, Austin, Amarillo, wherever. They   re coming.  Came home.  They   d come home.  Well, Bob   s got some hunting stories, probably, coyote or     Yes, Daddy had them old hounds.  When did you get the hounds? When did y   all start the hounds?  Twenty-one or twenty-two. I don   t know. He just always had them  hounds, seemed like.  How many?  He said in    34 when times were so tough, he had a lot more hounds than  he had kids, and he had about seven kids. People would ask him,    How  do you feed all them dogs and all them kids?    He said,    Every time I  catch a coyote, the government sends me some money.    Said,    Oh, that  made people mad.    He said it wasn   t none of their business how he fed  them. He raised corn and milo. He   d take it over to T. P. Sutton   s at  Olustee, and they   d grind it. He   d put cracklings with it and stuff, and  that   s how he fed them dogs.  Yes, they   d eat grain, wouldn   t they?  Oh, yes. If you   d grind it, yes, they   d eat it.  14  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Oats and stuff like that. Cracklings, is that pork?  Yes. Pork rinds is what it is.  Did you have a smokehouse on your property?  No, we salt cured that meat. Granddad had one. I don   t remember a  smokehouse, I don   t think.  Speaking of salt, you were talking earlier about Epsom salt and how that  helped you out. Will you tell us about that experience?  When I stuck the thorn in my hand, I stuck it in there plum to the bone.  A mesquite thorn?  Yes, one of those dead ones. Mama would put that Epsom salt on there  and keep it wet, wake up in the middle of the night and sprinkle it with a  clothes sprinkler, and by about the second night, it got it drawed out of  there.  What are some other home remedies you remember?  Kerosene, sugar. They used it all.  Who stepped on the hoe?  George Roberts. He cut it nearly to the bone. They just put his foot in  kerosene there and soaked it about two or three hours, wrapped it up and  took him home. Took him over to Granddad   s. They lived in Chickasha.  He had a scar when he died, but he never did limp on it or nothing. Went  in the Navy and everything. I guess it   s a pretty good remedy. (Laughs)  He didn   t die from kerosene, then, did he?  No, he didn   t die from kerosene, no. He died from cancer. I guess they   d  say kerosene caused it. (Laughter) I just, I don   t know. He   d get a cold,  they   d put that thick salve on there, put that rag on it.  What year did you graduate high school?  Fifty-eight.  Then what did you do?  Went to farming.  15  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  With your dad?  Yes, and hunting. I   m a pretty good hunter.  What all do you hunt?  Quail, and hunt coyotes with them dogs. Quail hunting.  Do you eat the quail?  You bet. We got where we just killed so many, we were giving them to  people. Now there are not any. There used to be quail everywhere. They  say the hogs are getting them. I went to a meeting in Oklahoma City.  They said the cedar trees is why there wasn   t no quail. There ain   t no  cedar trees here. Them red cedars, there   s not any here. I don   t know  why. They   re fixing to spend a million dollars to try to figure out why  there ain   t no quail, here and in Texas, too.  Do you remember there being a lot of crows?  Oh, golly, yes. Oh, golly, yes. All day, they   d fly up and down that river,  just a string of them. Randy, you remember that?  Yes. Yes, it   d just never end, it seemed like.  No. You   d get up every morning, and they   d be all around your house. I  just, I don   t know. I don   t know what happened to them. You may see  five or six. That   s all.  J. L. says they dynamited them one year.  Oh, yes, right there down there east of Granddad   s. Daddy said they  filled cans, they put in all morning, filling cans up with rocks and stuff.  They put that dynamite in it, and when them crows got there and settled  down, then they set it off. Daddy said you could go hunting at night with  them old hounds after that, just be walking along, and something would  just walk up to you. It would be one of them darn crows. (Laughs) Crazy  after that dynamite. But, boy, it killed a bunch of them. Yes, you had  trouble with them crows. As many pecans as there are here now, they   d  have a field day.  Did you ever hunt with Soupy Risinger or Doc Risinger?  Doc, he had hounds. I bird hunted with him. Soupy, cat hunted with  Soupy some back there. He had cat dogs.  16  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Yes, bobcat.  Yes.  Are there many bobcats in the area?  A lot now. A lot of cats. I see them every day on that grader, every day.  Do you ever duck hunt?  Boy, Mama could make duck dressing out of this world. Several years  ago, an old kid I went to school with   did you know Mr. Briscoe? He  said,    Boy, I wish Kate was alive. I   d kill some of them ducks that   s  everywhere. I   d kill some of them ducks and have her make me some of  that duck dressing.    (Laughs) Ah, she could make good duck dressing.  She just made it from scratch. She didn   t buy the fixings up from town.  She could sure make duck dressing. When Mama died, we went out to  Fern and Preston   s for Christmas, and nobody knew how to make  dressing. Mama always made the dressing. None of them girls, I don   t  think none of them knew how to make dressing. Mama done all that.  She   d cook that cornbread up, and have that   you know the difference  between dressing and stuffing, don   t you?  What?  You don   t know the difference?  I don   t know. (Laughs)  Dressing is what you cook in a pan. Stuffing is what you put in the  turkey and cook it.  Yes, we always have dressing.  Did you? We used to have stuffing, way back then. Mama would stuff it.  Taste about the same or similar?  Yes, tastes about the same. That stuffing did have more of the game  taste.  And the dressing would get crunchier.  Yes. But, boy, that duck dressing, man, that was good.  17  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  Would you kill your own turkeys for Thanksgiving or Christmas?  There wasn   t no turkeys here. That was before turkeys. After we married  was the first turkeys I ever seen, after me and Erma,    68 or somewhere  in there. Somewhere in there, that   s about the first turkey I   d ever seen.  Every year over on the Richie place, that little twelve-acre field there,  we   d put it in high gear, and they   d put the turkeys in there. Boy, they  done good. They   d have them big old long heads on it, and them turkeys  do good. They   d fatten up there. That   s the first turkeys I remember  seeing. They put them in there on that Richie place. They thought they  had to have grain. Them turkeys, they don   t have to have nothing.  Just river bottom.  Yes, river bottom. Big cottonwood trees, that   s what them turkeys need.  What do you remember about meeting Erma?  I don   t know. Just what she told you. (Laughter)  You didn   t think I was cute or nothing?  I thought you could hoe cotton. (Laughter)  Did you ever know Beans Risinger?  Why, yes. Yes, all my life. You know, we were so ignorant, me and  Frog.  Yes, I remember that name. Frog Risinger.  Beans would come back here when she was playing ball. I was always  staying the night up there at Frog   s. Beans would come from Michigan  back here. Why didn   t we get some of those caps or some of that stuff?  She   d have brought us caps if we   d just said we need one of them caps. I  don   t know why. I thought about that a bunch of times. When Beans  come back here to live, before she died, why didn   t we say anything  about that? I don   t know. She   d have give us caps. She could have  brought them back here or anything. I don   t know.  She kind of made it big in softball, didn   t she?  Girl   s baseball, yes, she made it. When they made that movie A League  of Their Own, she was up there telling them how they done things when  they made that movie. I don   t know why we didn   t have her to bring us  caps or shirts or something. If we had them, we would   ve just wore them  18  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  until we wore them out. That   d have been it. I don   t know why. I  thought about that a bunch of times after she moved back here, why we  didn   t do that. I don   t know. Hindsight is better than foresight. That   s  what it is. Never think of anything like that.  What all did your granddad Tucker do with horses?  Oh, he just raised those colts. Daddy said he would raise thirty colts a  year.  And then sell them?  Yes, oh yes, they   d sell them. Like that place there that Jim Shirley   s got  right west of Granddaddy   s house. The old boy was going to leave. He  couldn   t make a living on it. He told Granddad, he said,    I   ll take a team  and a wagon for that place.    Granddaddy give him a team and a wagon.  That   s 160 acres?  Yes, up there west across the road. Granddad gave him a team and a  wagon for it. Granddad had more up and down near all that river and  stuff, and he was farming it, but he couldn   t. Daddy and Jim tried to get  him to keep it. An old boy come along and wanted some land to farm.  Granddad said,    Give me a team and a wagon. That   s what I give for it.  I   ll let you have it.    He said they tried to get him to keep it. Said,    He  needs a place to farm. I   ll get a team and a wagon,    and he got a team  and a wagon for it. It sold here in    80 for a thousand dollars an acre. He  needed a team and a wagon, got it, traded the team and the wagon and  got rid of it. Said old boy needed a place to farm.  Helped him out.  Yes.  So would your dad in the summers have more help come in to help in the  cotton fields?  He didn   t need no help, not with eight kids. Why would he need help?  What about your grandfather?  He had some people living in them little shacks, year round.  Did he ever go to southeastern Oklahoma and pick up some more  people?  19  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Daddy and T. P. Sutton did, to pull bolls. T. P. had a truck. They   d go  down to get people, bring them back up here to pull bolls.  And they were just ready and waiting to come up and help?  Yes. They used to come pull bolls. They   d live in the little house we had  out back, out there. Johnson was their name. Some of them lived with  Doc Risinger. Some of them lived there. Daddy and Doc, down east in  Tupelo, Oklahoma, and they was hunting down there. They stayed  longer than they was going to, and they run out of money to eat. So they  were hunting with them people down there, Harley Johnson, and they  told him they was out of money, but they had enough money for gas to  get home. Harley said,    Just come up here and live in our yard, and you  can just eat with us.    So they did, and they hired them to come up here  in the fall and pull bolls. They come up here for years. Mr. and Mrs.  Johnson had them kids, and I still hear from them kids at times. People  will say that they seen them somewhere, the Pettys over at Tipton down  there. They was asking about me, if they knew me.  Buddy Petty?  Yes. Them Johnsons, they was good people. They come up here and had  a Model-T truck, and there wasn   t no Model-Ts in this country then.  They were poor, and they   d come up here and pull bolls, living out in  that shack out back out there and in that old garage. Some of them lived  in that garage. They   d come up here and pull bolls.  Were they white folks?  Yes. When they   d go to southeast Oklahoma and get them black people  to come up here and pull bolls.  Is there a story about one of them changing their name?  Oh, yes. One of them run off and went to Altus, knowed Granddad. His  name was White when he lived there at Granddad   s. They was hunting a  fellow named White, and they was explaining to the black folks what he  looked like. They said,    We know one that looks just like that named  Tucker.       Where at?    They told them, and we went over there, and there  he was. He had changed his name. I guess whoever they worked for last,  that   s the name they had.  Daddy said that in spring when they   d go to cutting cotton stalks, getting  ready to plant cotton, he   d loosen that ground, and said there   d be some  of them black boys wanting to be a farmer. He said they   d get him out  there and put him on stalk cutter, one of them rattling stalk cutters  20  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  behind two horses. One horse, sometimes two. They   d send him a half  mile over there, and that horse had never been worked before. He said  when he turned around, if he got on rows, he   d cut it coming back, fast.  Said he   d get all of them black women down there, and they   d make a  big V, where they   d feed him in that lot. By the time he   d get there, he  would bail off. He didn   t want to be a farmer no more. (Laughs) Daddy  said it was comical back there with them horses.  What   s the first tractor you remember having?  A little 8N Ford tractor. Daddy bought one of them in    37. Bought  another one in    39. Then in    42, said they come out with, in    42 or    43,  they come out with a good one, and he bought one of them. It didn   t  have the coil up in front by the radiator. It was back there where you  could work on it, back there easy. That   s why it was so much better.  Redesigned.  Yes. Yes. In    42 or    43 he said he bought that tractor. Give five hundred  dollars for it. Cost thirty-five dollars to overhaul the motor and thirty-five  dollars to overhaul the power lift.  Was that new price, five hundred?  Yes.  Did many people around here have to go participate in World War II?  Oh, yes, every kid did World War II, yes.  Any of your relatives?  J. L. went up to Oklahoma A M, and he just stayed about six months  until World War II broke out, and he come home.    I   m home. I   m going  to fight old Tito and the emperor of Japan.    He went and joined the  service.  He was your only brother that went?  He was the only one that was old enough to. He quit A M up there and  went to fight Tito. I guess that   s the only education he had. He got to be  president of the California Bankers Association. I guess six months at  A M he learned all he needed to know. (Laughter)  It   s a really good school. (Laughs)  21  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  R. Wilson  I guess it is  (Laughter)  Well, what was that story about Granny Tucker   s hair catching on fire?  Oh, her back. That old gown, that old flannel gown that she wore, yes,  she backed up to a heater, drying her long hair, and she caught that old  flannel gown on fire and burned her back bad. She wouldn   t go, and  after about three days my uncle called her doctor. She hadn   t said  nothing about it, so he got Daddy to come over there. Mama made her  go to the doctor. She said,    Them old Indians never went to the doctor.     Daddy said,    Them old Indians are all dead, too     (Laughter)  So would people normally dry their hair on the stove? I mean, I guess  that was the main heat source, so     I guess they did. There wasn   t no hair dryers, anyway, back then. That   d  be about the best way to dry it, wouldn   t it?  Was that one of those open flame propane heaters?  Yes, a little wall heater. Anyway, she caught that old flannel gown on  fire.  So do you keep in touch with many people that went to Southside?  Yes, I see them every year up there at the  high school reunion , yes. A  lot of them kids in my class has died. Had heart attacks or something.  How many were in your graduating class?  I think eleven.  Did most of them stay in the area?  Oh, for a while. They married and moved off, and this and that.  Generally your brothers and sisters come back for the reunion?  We used to have it when every one of us would be here. I   ve seen that.  Preston and Fern don   t come. Fern   s got Alzheimer   s. She wouldn   t be  satisfied if she was here. They got old, and I don   t know. They   re just  not coming.  Are there any more stories you can think of?(Laughs)  There   s another heater story. Toter McGee.  22  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  Oh, when he     Might as well hear another heater story.  (Laughter) That old boy lived here. We bought this house off of him. He  carried a big old box of matches, and he smoked Bull Durham cigarettes  or P. A., Bull Durham, both. He carried a box of kitchen matches in his  hip pocket, backed up to one of them heaters, got it on fire and went to  running around that stove. They poured some   his brother, Shine.  Shine McGee.  Shine McGee and Toter McGee, he poured some   what do they call it?  Oh, the tea kettle?  The tea kettle, full of hot water on his hip pocket and put the fire out.  Everybody here has got a nickname.  You don   t always know where they come from.  (Laughter) No, no. I don   t know where Shine got his. Soupy, Donkey.  Bugs Mayo, where   d that come from?  I don   t know. I don   t know.  Snowball Ward.  Snowball Ward. I don   t know. They   ve all got a nickname. That   s what  Waldo   s had to work with. His name is Elda. Pitt Ware said I can   t  pronounce that name, so he went and called him Waldo. That   s what  stuck with him. Waldo says if you   re from Hess, you   ve got a nickname.  I don   t know how they got it.  About when did Hess    population start dropping?  In the late    50s. This country wasn   t ready for this cotton stripping stuff.  It took all them people to pull all these bolls and all that stuff. When the  cotton strippers started, that done away with them. I wouldn   t go back to  them days. I   d rather have what they got now. They   ve got pickers and  stuff that they   ve got now, these tractors. I don   t believe tractors can  come as far in the next fifty as they have in the last fifty. If they do, there  won   t have to be nobody in the field. They   ll just send it out there. You  don   t drive it no more. It comes to them. Turn around and punch a  23  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  button, and it goes without touching the steering wheel. I don   t know if  they can do that in the next fifty years or not. (Laughs) Boy.  It   s really changed farming.  It sure has.  So Hess has two gins, two gas stations.  Yes. Two grocery stores.  A theater? Did they ever have a theater of sorts?  No. Toby and Susie would come up there in the fall every year and put  on little shows. They had a little traveling deal, and they   d come up there  and put on a little show in a tent. The Toby and Susie Show. They   d  come every fall to get boll pullers    money. They   d go from here to  Tipton to Frederick, Snyder     We never went to one.  Every little town.  Maybe it was before us.  Might   ve been. When I was a kid, we went. Toby and Susie, everybody  went to Toby and Susie. They   d sell candy, a little sack of candy, and  they   d get that boll-pulling money.  Was it a man and a woman?  Yes. There was seven or eight of them, and they   d put on little shows in  that tent. They could fill it up, fill that little tent up with the boll pullers.  They didn   t have nothing else to do.  Were there many churches in Hess?  Two. The Church of Christ and the Baptist Church. Granddad and Tom  Yates    granddad are about the same age. Now, I was told this. I guess  it   s true. Said that they went to Mr. Yates and said,    We need money to  build a church,    when they built that Baptist Church.    Would you give  us some money?       Yes. If you go down and see Old Man Tucker, I   ll  match whatever he gives if you won   t tell him. You can   t tell him, or I  won   t give you nothing.       Okay.    They went to see Granddad and got  money. So him and Mr. Yates built that First Baptist Church in Hess.  Well, they needed money for a school. They come down and asked  24  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  Granddad,    Would you donate?       Yes. If you go up there and get money  from Old Man Yates, I   ll match whatever he gives.    They said that   s  when they built the first school. I   ve heard that from several old timers  back there. They call one another    Old Man.    One of them   s just as old  as the other one. I don   t know where they got it, but that   s how they said  the first church and first school come about.  Granddad used to be kind of a banker, didn   t he? Sort of out of his own  pocket, loaned money?  Yes, he always    You   d go over there, and he   d have you,    Clean that  chicken house, and I   ll pay you.    You   d put in all day. He had a big old  chicken house. He had a bank bag. Looked like a sock deal to me, but it  had the name of a bank on it, rolled it up. He couldn   t see real good, but  he could feel in there. He   d feel, and (it would just be full of money)  he   d come out with one quarter to give you. He never came out with  two. He   d come out with one. (Laughter) He could work you pretty good  for a quarter. Of course, Granny   d feed you, but you worked pretty good  to get a quarter.  Tell them about the cemetery, whenever you put the name on the  cemetery.  When we put that up there?  Yes.  Well, you know where the Hess Cemetery sign is. I don   t remember  what year it was. Do you remember?  It was in the    70s.  Sometime in the    70s. We took it and put that up there. Dug the hole and  got everything ready.    Little Pluto White,    Homer White was helping.  Pluto?  Yes. I don   t know where he got that. He got up on there. Now listen. He  barely hung by one hand. He liked to fell off there. We told him he   d be  the first fellow under that thing, going to that cemetery, to bury him in.  Who helped? All the farmers were there, and everybody.  Yes. All the farmers took and built that thing and put it up, up there.  So everybody came out and helped?  25  B. Tucker  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  L. Wilson  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  Oh, yes. Used to, we used to have one day (sometimes two days: one in  the spring and one in the fall) they   d go clean that cemetery.  It   s extra nice.  Everybody would participate in that. Women had that little clubhouse  there in Hess where they quilted. They   d fix dinner, and everybody  would go down there and eat. Then, I don   t know who come up with this  deal. Donate some money once a year to the deal, and they just hire  somebody, and they clean it now, mow it and stuff.  Was there a women   s home demonstration club?  Yes, yes. That   s what it was, yes.  Do you know who was the main agent?  Ask her. She went to the quilting stuff.  Well, I don   t know. There was a lot of ladies. Like, I don   t know who  the   you mean the boss?  Yes, the home extension     Home extension agent?  Well, no. We didn   t have a home extension     Yes, they did.  Well, I mean it was from Altus.  From Altus?  From Altus.  That would be Ida Fay, wouldn   t it?  Ida Fay Winters?  That was before Ida Fay.  Yes, that was before Ida Fay, but all the ladies around Hess would go  over there and quilt.  26  L. Wilson  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  R. Wilson  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  What would they do with the quilts? Keep them for themselves, or     No, they   d keep them for themselves. They would   like if I wanted  some quilts quilted for me, I would take the main dish, and then  everybody else would take the vegetables or dessert and stuff, then they  would quilt my quilt.  That was before quilts got high. That was whenever they used them to  sleep under. They didn   t use them to sell. You slept under quilts then.  Had them old wool blankets, them old cotton blankets and stuff. You   d  get between them, and about three quilts on top of you, and you could  make it when that snow was flying.  Back to the cemetery, do you know where the land for the cemetery  initially came from?  Yes, it was donated up there. Bill Risinger, see, he donated some land.  After he bought that place where it   s sitting, he donated some land. But  they   ve got some more land now if they need to use it. Yes, he just  donated the land, originally. In    38, it covered with snow. People used to  go up there with shovels and dig their grave. They dug that grave, and it  covered with snow. They carried that body from Hess up there to the  cemetery to bury it.  Carried, meaning     Carried the casket from the church.  Wow.  Like walking with it?  Yes. The snow was so deep, they couldn   t get up there with nothing, so  they just hauled off and carried it up there and buried it. They   d dug that  grave. They wasn   t going to waste digging a grave in that rock and not  bury somebody in it, so when it come time to bury that fellow, they took  him up there and buried him.  What I was thinking about, you know, the commissioners, they took  credit for putting the sign up on the cemetery, but it wasn   t the  commissioners that put it in there. It was the farmers. Bob Tucker, Jim  Briscoe, Lois Briscoe, all these people.  Lois. Lit Ware.  Lit Ware, all of these.  27  B. Tucker  E. Tucker  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  B. Tucker  L. Wilson  Yes, we put in two or three days there, building that thing.  Welding that thing.  And then we had to go back after that and add three foot on it. It wasn   t  tall enough for the backhoes to get under it. After they got a backhoe     Well, I want to thank you for visiting with me today.  You   re welcome.  It   s been great.  -------  -------
