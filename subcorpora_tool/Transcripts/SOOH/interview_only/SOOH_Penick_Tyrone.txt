 L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  Today is April 8, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Altus, Oklahoma, today with Tyrone Penick,  talking with him for the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Series, and  we   re joined by Randy Wilson. Thanks for having us in your home.  You bet.  Would you mind telling me when and where you were born, to start out  with?  I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, February 9, 1942.  And what were your parents    names?  Archie and Opal Penick. Archie Vernon Penick and Opal Penick. She  was an Opal Owens before, her maiden name.  Did you grow up in Lawton?  No, my mother and dad separated when I was about five or four, four or  five, right along there, and I grew up in Tipton. My dad stayed in  Lawton, Oklahoma. My granddad first came to Oklahoma with his  father, who homesteaded across the street from Meers Store, there in that  area in the Wichita Mountains. My dad was born in Lawton, but he grew  up in the Wichita Mountains. Both of them were big, big treasure  hunters because back then it was right after the James -Younger  gang  and all of the stories that went around, the lost silver mines, the lost gold  mines in the Wichitas, which there has been very little found, but there   s  been signs of some found.  Times were hard back then. You could only make so much money. You  5  R. Wilson  T. Penick  had the CCC  Civilian Conservation Corps  and places like that that  would hire you to where you could work, but as a good pastime they  looked for the bounty that would make them a lot of money. They were  quite successful with it. They were good at finding things. The most  notable one find that they found was the copper kettle. Everybody either  calls it iron kettle or copper kettle. It   s made out of copper because they  were able to write all the names on it. If anybody will go on Google or a  website on Oklahoma treasures, you can find out. Just punch it in, and  you   ll find out everything that I could tell you about now.  Where   d these treasures come from? As I recall, the Butterfield Line  stagecoach ran right through Lawton, heading down to Texas.  It did, but I   ve never heard of an actual stage coach being robbed like  that. James gang got to where they concentrated a lot on trains more than  stages, but the type of gold they found was more than likely the type of  gold that was being transported. One of the biggest treasures that Dad  was looking for as late as 1972 that I   ll tell you about here in a minute     but let   s not get ahead of ourselves. In 1948, when Joe Hunter was the  sheriff out in Lawton, Oklahoma, my granddad and my dad found this  copper kettle. That opened up a big area for them because they had had  to find two or three things that led them to this copper kettle.  If anybody wants to find some, really read the history of treasure stories  in Oklahoma, you need to go get Steve Wilson   s book  Oklahoma  Treasures and Treasure Tales . Everybody reads it. I   ve seen people  roaming the mountains with this book under their arms looking for it  because there   s still signs. On page 143, there   s a picture of Frank  Dalton and Joe Hunter with this pot, and they   re talking. I   ve had people  come over and ask me questions, hoping I can tell them something more  than what they know. I know why Joe Hunter is sitting there because  he   s sitting in my dad   s house. As you read this article, it tells about  where they buried Captain Jack. Well, one of the things they had done to  mark Captain Jack   s, where they buried him, is that everybody had  emptied their pistols and guns into a tree. My dad and grandfather were  out getting firewood one day. Now, this is a story from my dad. They hit  this tree to cut it up, and they glanced off of it. They got to looking at it,  and it was just plum full of lead. They didn   t think a whole lot about it,  but then they heard later on, someone got to telling them it   s close to  there. They went back to try to find it, and it   d fallen over. Termites had  eaten it all up and whatever.  Frank Dalton was still alive, so they went down to Texas where he was  living and brought him up to Lawton to try to get him to show where it  was. He was already nearly a hundred years old at the time. He didn   t  remember it, but he wanted to get back to Lawton, Oklahoma. Side note:  6  about that time, he also wrote a book claiming he was the real Jesse  James. It   s a real interesting book, and there   s a lot of things that  probably makes it sound   I don   t believe he was. They   ve had a whole  TV series. If you remember, whenever Geraldo uncovered the grave to  see if it was really Jesse James    grave, if he was really in there, he went  to that extent. This type of lore has just pulled people to Oklahoma for  years. It   s fun. You can make a game out of it, or you can really get  serious and do some research.  People that have really researched have linked the James gang with the  Knights of the Golden Circle. That in itself is a study and very  interesting in how that came about. The basic thing about them is that  they buried money and kept it in case the South came back and they  needed more money. Somebody always watched where that was buried.  They lived close to it. Dad had visited with people who told them that  their dad would disappear every morning, come back in that night. They  don   t know where he went. They were convinced he went someplace to  watch over a burial site. I   d see things like that growing up in my  generation. I thought,    Ah, that can   t be true,    but when my granddad  passed away after roaming all over the Wichita Mountains, he moved to  Arkansas, a place close to Lockesburg, Arkansas.  I went over to see him one time, and Dad said,    You got to go see this.     We went up to a place that this guy was literally living in a cave. Came  out with this old long beard, and Dad said,    Now, don   t say anything.    I  thought,    Why not?    But that   s what they were doing. My granddad had  gone all the way to Arkansas to visit with that guy and be close enough  to him, hoping to get enough information from him. Around  Lockesburg, also, they have a lot of burial mounds, which is a certain  tribe of Indians that would build great big mounds of dirt. If they had a  lot of deaths in their tribe or something, they would bury them in this  one spot. There   s several of those around Lockesburg.  I   m getting away from it again, but you can jump off of subject after  subject after subject. The email I gave you a while ago of the young man  who works over in the Wichita Mountains, now, I give him credit. He   s  probably one of the most knowledgeable treasure hunters because he has  spent hours searching and looking, and with his youth and his job right  where he is, he is right there where he can do it. Luckily, he was able to  find a lot of Joe Hunter   s maps and stuff when he died. He found them     somebody bought them at a garage sale. Of course, that   s prime material  for treasure hunters. If you dig far enough and keep doing enough  research   some people say,    Oh, this is just a bunch of junk,    and they  throw it away, but that information is still out there that a lot of people  had worked on. The James gang are the ones that treasure hunting in  Oklahoma brings the most excitement about because we can authenticate  7  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  things that you actually say,    That pot was buried by them. There   s their  signatures on it.    There   s a picture in the book here of a cave that has    J.  J.    and    F. J.    initials blown into the side of the mountain over the top of  the cave.  How   d they sign those pots?  Well, this was copper. They probably used a little ol    chisel. They think  it was brass, but it might   ve been copper because there was a lot of  writing done on it. Whether it was brass or copper really doesn   t matter.  Neither one of them would deteriorate. That   s what they wanted. Didn   t  want it to rust out. But back to the initials over the cave, one of the times  I got to go with Dad on a treasure hunt, he and one of his partners   it  was either Dwight or Dwayne. I forget the other one. We went up there  and actually were on Indian land where we weren   t especially supposed  to be. We snuck in over it, and there   s these    J. J.    and    F. J.    Up in that  part of Oklahoma, it   s the old hard sand, and you can dig   what do you  call the cellar back up in the wall where they could put their   root  cellars? A lot of people would do that because you walk up in there. It  was just like a cellar, but you get five feet up in there, and it   s cool. Hot  summertime, they   d live up in those things.  We went for a specific purpose, looking for a specific item. They got out  their metal detectors and started feeling around, and pretty soon the  signal goes off. Oh, they get excited, and they dig down. Well, here   s  this metal can that had a knife in it with a broken blade. I was  disappointed, but they were happy about it. They said,    Well, we missed  this one.    I said,    What do you mean you missed it?       Well, someone  else has already found it.    Usually, when somebody finds what was  already there, they   ll put something to show you it   s already been found,  but you get the thrill of finding it. I was there when we got the thrill of  finding that one. The biggest thrill I got out of it, when we were leaving,  there was a buckeye tree growing there. I   d never seen a buckeye tree.  Have you?  No, no.  There were buckeyes laying all over the ground. I picked up a couple  buckeyes that were     That   s an Ohio plant.  Yes, it is.  How old were you?  8  T. Penick  Oh, I was probably seventeen, eighteen years old by then. The other time  I went on a treasure hunt with Dad is that he wanted me to go up to a  spot. We was in a refuge. We took his Geiger counter, and we got up in  there, and he started running it around. Man, we found more tabs from  cans and stuff, but you couldn   t tell where you were. What had  happened is that Dad had been up here before, traced out what he was  looking for, dug down, and he found a red ball of clay. Well, he just  threw it down on the ground and went ahead with the digging. Years  later, he was telling about what he had found. The treasure he was  looking for was a jeweled cross, a gold cross that had jewels in it.  According to the legend of this particular story, that was being carried  by a priest. Indians were attacking him or something. He took that gold  cross, made a paste out of the soil, made a ball out of it. When it dried, it  was just like a round rock. When he was telling the story, somebody  said,    Well, you threw the rock out. That was your treasure.    So we  went back to find it.  By then, the military had had all kinds of maneuvers on that area.  They   d spent the night, camped, and, of course, they buried all the trash.  Trying to find anything with a Geiger counter was nearly impossible, but  we got the thrill of doing it. I did. It was just another trip he was on, for  him. They spent a lot of time going over. My dad hunted treasure all the  way up until the day he died. He ended up moving from Lawton up to  Fort Gibson, there on the lake.  This is a story I   ll tell you that not a lot of people know about. Some  people know about it, but it   s different. I have actually held them in my  hand. We were in Lawton one night, and I mean there were tornadoes all  over the place. He called me, and we had a sign. He said,    If I ever call  you and tell you I   ve got a broken arm or something, you drop what  you   re doing and come to help me,    because treasure hunters, if you find  something, there   s always somebody that thinks they own part of it, and  our government is one of them. We definitely wouldn   t do that. He  called me and said,    I   ve got something I need to show you. I have to  return it tomorrow. I   ve got to show it to you tonight. You need to come  over.       I   m not going to leave my family and come over there. We   ve  got tornadoes all around us.    He said,    Okay, I   ll come to you.     So from Lawton to Wichita Falls in this terrible storm, he came in, and  he showed me three or two lead bars that had writing on them. These  were bars that had holes in them that people wore around his neck. Well,  these particular bars were given to him to read what was described on  them. He had the talent of being able to decipher what the signs meant.  He knew what they said, but the third bar tells him where to go find it.  He was not going to tell them what they said until they would let him see  the third bar and be part of it. Well, they wouldn   t let him do it, so we  9  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  never did get to see the third bar. These were bars that told about a  Moffat gold bar, a trainload or   it wasn   t a train. It was a wagon train.  Wasn   t a wagon, borough train loaded with Moffat bars, going to a mint  in Philadelphia to have them melted down into gold coin from  California. They got, I don   t know whether it was Indians or whatever it  was that attacked them and got it. They had to bury them all. We   re  talking about four or five different locations with something like twenty  thousand, sixty thousand, thirty thousand of these little bars. Well, each  one of them is an ounce.  When I get home, I start investigating. Was there such thing as a Moffat  gold bar? Sure enough, in California, that was a man   s name. Rather  than having to spend money on gold dust or powder all the time, he  loaded these little one-ounce Moffat gold bars. There are three of them  in existence. Now one of them is at the Smithsonian, but these lead bars  told where those Moffat gold bars were. All those have never been found  yet. That was what he was looking for. He was still trying to find it  whenever he died.  So that night he had two of them in his possession?  Two of them, yes, and I have what they said. He wanted me to be sure  and note everything was down, so I wrote down everything that was on  them. Of course, I keep them in my safe. Some people, you may find  some information where they say they know what it is. Somebody else  might   ve been able to read them since then. After he passed away, I got  to looking through a bunch of his stuff, and I found a piece of paper that  he had jibbered down all the signs and wrote out beside them what they  meant. Like this. He owned Penick   s Microflex Agency there in Lawton  at one time, so he   d draw the sign, and then he typed out beside it what it  meant.  I was really glad to find that. That   s something a little bit more personal  between he and I. I   ve enjoyed looking at that. My mother had always  said this little Penick Microflex Agency   you remember on the back  end of a car on your red lights, even if the lights aren   t on, they   re  reflective in the lens? The red lens is built in such a way that it reflects?  Yes.  Back then, in 1947 or so, is when they first came out with that. They had  signs that had those on them where you   d have your street sign or  number sign beside your house, and that   s what he was selling is that  product. That   s what the letterhead was standing for. The Moffat gold  bars was the last thing I really got to visit with him about.  10  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  When did he pass away?  I want to say    91, right around there. I don   t know the exact date, but  just about what it was.  What was your grandfather   s name?  Herbert Penick, Herb. He married a lady from   you get to doing  genealogy, you get to find interesting things, too. He married a lady  from Sharon, Texas, whose last name was Hunt, and she had a brother.  She had a brother or somebody that   wait a minute. Who was the very  first cowboy at the movies?  Tom Mix?  No, before him. Bob Hurt. Hurt. That   s who it was. It was Hurt because  the first filmed cowboy was Bob Hurt. I don   t know for a fact, but I bet  you if I were to do research through their names, that would be the same  Bob Hurt. In my research, I found out that there   s a Penick   when John  Wayne made all his pictures, he always ran around with about eleven     and you can throw out whatever you don   t want from all this. He ran  around with about six or seven guys all the time. They always were in  his movies whenever he could write them in there. I guess it   s because  whatever they earned helped support or they all got along real good. One  of them was a Penick. You can tell he   s kin to us some way for his ears.  You just have to know to look for who it was. But then John Wayne,  when I was reading some of his early history, was looking for some of  the same treasures that my dad was. I   ve often thought,    I wonder if that  Penick influenced John Wayne like that.    That   s the type of thing you   d  like to ask them if you ever had a chance to actually visit with one of  them.  You mentioned that your dad worked for the CCC?  Yes.  What did you hear about that?  Well, he was in Seabees during World War II. Whenever they came  back, there wasn   t enough jobs for everybody. One of the things they did  over in the Wichita Mountains was they went in and built a lot of the  dams for the lakes they   ve got there now, and they built the road going  up Mount Scott. The road going up Mount Scott might   ve been done  right before the war, but it was along about that same time. The history  of the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge is real neat in itself. Teddy  Roosevelt was the one that saw that it was established.  11  L. Wilson  T. Penick  B. Penick  The buffalo were nearly extinct. In the whole United States, there were  only seven in a zoo in New York City. There were some. We had seven  of them shipped back to the Wichita Wildlife Refuge and turned them  loose there. All the buffaloes that you see throughout the United States  now are descendants of those original seven that would   ve been lost. Of  course, I always still like to go to the refuge. I cut through there every  time I   m going to Edmond. My wife has asked me several times,    What  do you like so much about all these?    I tell her, I said,    Well, it restores  my soul whenever I go through.    (Laughs)  Did you say you went with your father before when he was working in  the area?  Oh, yes. In fact, I was there with him when I was little. He   d take me to  work with him because my stepmother and I didn   t get along real good.  He   d take me to work with him. I remember when the roads were just  gravel, especially the cave road that   s going up to Lost Lake now. Back  then, most of the roads would go down through a stream. They were  putting a bridge over it. On a hot summer day, the water out of those  mountains was always cold and cool. We were dumping piles of rock  down the road, and his job was to show the trucks exactly where to  dump, so when they started laying it out it would be the same amount of  gravel. He left me there in the low part of the stream as he worked his  way up the hill. Every now and then, he   d come back over and look  down at that stream of water and make sure I was okay. I can remember  that day I spent in that stream and how much I enjoyed it. It was so  much fun, how cool it was down there.  My granddad, one of the big thrills I remember on him is   have you  ever seen a bulldozer when they   re piling up dirt in one location? They  dump it and instead of having it scattered all over the place. They make  a big mountain out of it. Well, he was driving the bulldozer, and he put  me on that seat beside him. When you   re piling it up like that, you drive  that bulldozer up a sixty-degree incline. Your front end of the bulldozer  goes over the edge before he backs up. You know, for a four-year-old,  five-year-old kid, that was pretty exciting, scary as the devil, too. I do  remember that ride up that bulldozer with him. I have very fond  memories of the Penicks. There   s still a lot of Penicks living around  there. My grandmother was   her home when she passed away, they  moved it out to the   there   s a little cemetery in a little community out  there where they   re all buried. Do you remember the name of it,  Barbara, where a lot of the Penicks are buried out at that little church?  Valley, something Valley?  Paradise Valley.  12  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  Paradise Valley. That was the preacher   s home for a while. I don   t know  if the house is still there, but it was moved from around Medicine Park.  The history of the Penicks, too, they moved into Medicine Park and  helped establish Medicine Park before they moved on to Lawton. Where  they lived there in Lawton was the edge of town. Now the town is  probably five miles further west than what it was then.  And then what about the Meers area?  Well, back in its time, the Meers area, itself, had over ten thousand  people around it, miners, most of them, at one time.  Mining for what?  Mining for silver or gold, looking for it. There was some mines. In fact,  there   s a place over at Roosevelt where you can go see what   s left of an  old iron-crushing or silver-crushing plant. You can find pictures in this  book of what they looked like before, when it still had the metals on. It   s  just pillars of different heights. You can tell by sight what it was. You  can find a lot of holes all over those mountains (it   s dangerous) that you  could get hurt in. What was fun for me is that we   d go down before  those guys got there. Dad would take me right in and say,    Come on, I  want to show you something.    We would start up where some trees  were, and he   d say,    You see this?    It   d either be a turtle or a turkey  track. It would be pointing in a certain way, maybe an arrowhead  pointing a certain way or a spearhead pointing a certain way. He   d start  explaining to me what that was and where it pointed and where he traced  it down to, what it led to, to show where they had dug the silver for.  I was asking about it one time. I said,    Did you ever find anything?    He  said,    Well, yes, we did.    Most treasure hunters won   t tell you what they  found. Dad   s gone now, and they can   t file any taxes against him or  whatever, but he found a set of saddlebags one time in a cave that had  some gold coins in them and paper currency, too. By the time he found  it, the paper currency had deteriorated down. He didn   t bother with it,  but with a piece of currency, if you   ve got any sign of the serial number  on it, they   ll honor it. He wasn   t going to do that either because there  might   ve been a record of where it went. If it came out of a bank robbery  a hundred years before, he wasn   t going to share it with anyone. As  much time as they spent looking for something like that, they   ve got to  have some kind of reward. It   s not like finding the   what was it, the big  underwater treasure that the guy found from the big ship that   s worth  millions of dollars?  The Spain claim.  13  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  Yes, they get a lot of money out of something like that. A lot of that  stuff, of course, needs to go into a museum if it   s any historical thing.  One good thing about it, though, is that I remember my granddad. He  had a stack of cigar boxes full of arrowheads that I know was over three  feet tall. He had grinding bows, spearheads, all kinds of artifacts. He  donated most of them to museums. Dad had a few, but not very many  pieces of it. To actually see all the Indian artifact items, you appreciate it  a little more, too. I   m glad to see they were sent someplace where it   d be  used. That   s what the Penicks did until I came along. Of course, I  haven   t amounted to a dime. (Laughter)  Well, how did they really get passionate about this? I mean, it takes a lot  of effort.  It does. Randy, if someone had told you that someplace on your farm  over there that someone was known to have buried something     I   d be out there looking.     you   d be looking, wouldn   t you? Yes. (Laughter) Well, the same thing  holds true up here on Devil   s Canyon, right up here on the mountain  straight north of us. They know they have maps of a group that buried  something up there. In fact, on top of the mountain up there you   ll find  carved in rock, Captain  Randolph  Marcy   s name carved in rock. He  was the first     Explorer.  Thank you. He was the first explorer, but he was military. It was right  before the Civil War.  A surveyor.  Yes, and you can find where his signature is on top of those mountains.  People have gone out and tried to find that. That   s all owned by one  family, Winters family, and they   re also in this book, real nice article  about them. Dad and his treasure-hunting buddy had uncovered some  pretty good evidence on it, and they wanted to go up there and look  again. I knew Lorne and his brother Berle, and went up there. They were  working cattle that day, so we just jumped in, and we helped them. After  we got through working the cattle, they knew we were there for a  purpose. Dad asked them, he said,    We   d like to just come in and look.     Well, Lorne and Berle and their mother and dad had let a college group  do that from before. They had dug down through a dam up there that just  ruined the pond. They just would not let anybody do it at all, but us  14  L. Wilson  T. Penick  being friends, they said,    Well, let us think about it. We   ll let you  know.     They came back, and they said,    I   ll tell you what we   ll do. We   ll let  you go in and look for ten thousand dollars for one day, but you have to  split what you find in half with us.    They felt pretty strongly that  something was there, willing to charge us. If we   re willing to pay ten  thousand dollars, they   ll let us have our chance at it. They still feel real  strong that there   s something there, that one of these days it   ll be found.  You   d be surprised. You put this out on a newspaper, you mention my  name that I   m telling you all this stuff, I   ll start getting telephone calls  again. This gentleman with the email address I have given you has just  organized the treasure hunters down in this area. He   ll have a meeting  once a year and will show the watch that actually came out of this brass  pot. He has that. He has a copy of the map, a cover map that came out of  it. I have copies of it. He has been able to pull things back together. I  would really encourage you to go to that next meeting whenever they  have it because you   ll just pick up all kinds of treasure-hunting stories  from southwest Oklahoma. Really interesting.  So you grew up in Tipton?  Yes, until my mother married John Lichter, fine, fine guy. We lived  there until I graduated from high school in 1960. Then I, of course, went  on to college at OU and then Abilene Christian  University , went off  and did my thing. Barbara and I moved back here. Dad had opened up  an auto parts store here in    59, the year before I left. I had gone to work  for Sears. Working to become a manager for Sears, you put in at least  sixty hours a week, and I   d done that for about eight and a half years.  They wanted my family to move back to McAllen, Texas, and I nearly  lost both my kids in McAllen. They caught something that their little  tummies swelled up like they were pregnant. Their gums swelled out  over their teeth. The only way we got them over it was to get them out of  the valley. I asked the doctor that. He said,    Yes, the best thing to do is  get them out of here.     I had them on a plane that afternoon. Two weeks, they were cleared up.  There wasn   t any way in the world I was going to take them back to the  valley. Well, that causes problems with Sears when you don   t move  exactly when somebody tells you to. There was a new assistant store  manager that was supposed to come there that first of the month. The  store manager told me,    If we haven   t found you a place before then,  we   ll probably have to put you on leave without pay.    That just didn   t sit  well with me after I spent so many years of working for something. I  tried to say I   d done good for them. I went off and started another little  business, and then I got into a couple more. I was gone all the time. I  15  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  didn   t get to see the kids grow up because I was gone when they got up  and come in after they went to bed. Barbara and I got tired of it, and we  called Dad and said,    How about us coming to Altus   .    That thrilled  him to death, and we did it. That was    76. He died in    81, and we just  closed the store two years ago. Been real nice. We   ve been blessed with  it.  That   s neat.  Yes, got to see the kids grow up and be with Randy   s daddy.  And then your mother has lived in Tipton for a while?  All the time. My dad never did move to Altus. He would drive back and  forth every day. My mother went to work for the REA  Rural Electric  Association . Before she and Dad met, she had to have some way to  support herself. She went to work for the REA. Well, she had worked  for them for thirty-seven years, and he died in    81. So take    81 minus  thirty-seven, and that   s when she went to work for them. When they got  married, they had a little store there in Tipton, and then we moved the  store to Altus in    52, he and his brother. In    60, Dad went up and built  his home. Dad drove back and forth every day.  In January of    81, he came in   we   d had four wonderful years together.  In January of    81, he came in and said,    I   m going to start taking off a  day now and then.    I said,    Have at it.    You know, of course, I   d been  running everything since then for a long time. He certainly had it  coming. Fifteen days later, he died in a car accident. In all those trips  back and forth, never had an accident one. I guess the main thing that  taught Barbara and I is that you better make good use of the time you  have because you never know what   s going to happen. We look back at  the things that really formed our lives. When I was growing up, I knew  Randy when he was little, when he was born. In fact, we were all like  brothers back then.  Yes. Big family, big happy family. I learned to appreciate coffee going  over to y   all   s house. I could smell it every time I come. I thought,    They  won   t let me drink it, but it sure smells good.    (Laughter)  Everybody called him Rubert except me. I didn   t call him that. They  were best friends. Little town of Tipton, Oklahoma, it   s got a lot of  history in itself. That would make a good thing for you to do. And  you   re already doing that, aren   t you?  Yes.  16  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  B. Penick  T. Penick  B. Penick  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  You ought to research the history of the Tipton High School reunion. It   s  the oldest reunion in the state of Oklahoma, continuous reunion, every  year.  Did you go this year?  Oh, listen, I had such a big job last year, I didn   t go this year. In fact,  there weren   t but three of my class that went this year. We had a  gentleman that influenced all of my generation over my four years in  high school. Really sticks you. From the time I was in fourth grade, our  band director came to Tipton is Don Leavitt. He left Tipton in    61 and  came to Altus. He was one man that had more influence on a lot of kids,  very positive influence, so we had a reunion for him. Everybody came  back. It turned out real good. You ought to do a history on him  sometime because here is a man who had three different bands. He got  national recognition. They marched in two different presidential parades.  He even got to ride in Nixon   s limousine with him for some reason.  Did he ever go to Watonga?  Don   t think so. He went to Altus and then up to     Tyrone, I   ve got some coffee ready.  Good.  Randy says he   d like to have some. (Laughter)  Where did Don go from Altus?  Ponca City.  Yes, Ponca City. Yes, it was. That band had took two planes to carry  that group of band up to Washington.  Were you in the band?  Oh, yes. Yes. Why go out and get yourself beat up to death playing  football when you can ride on the bus with a good looking twirler all the  time? (Laughter)  What did you play?  I started off on the trombone. Then I played a trumpet, and I played a  baritone and a cornet. I played the snares or the bench drums in our little  band. I just had a ball. He and I got to be real good friends. We were  17  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  close mostly because when he was there at Tipton, he started working on  his master   s degree and driving back and forth to Weatherford every  Monday night. I would go with him to help keep him awake. We   ve  always been good friends.  How many kids did you graduate with in Tipton? How many kids were in  your graduating class?  Thirty-two. Now, the high school from freshman to seniors wasn   t but  150. We marched a hundred-piece band. Can you imagine that?  No.  Our band consisted of seventh graders through seniors. People watching  us would say,    Look at those little bitty kids going up and down the  deal.    But I   ll guarantee you, we never won less than first place when  we went to a contest because we would start our band practices a month  before school started, seven o   clock every morning. In a little farming  community, can you imagine the dedicated parents that brought their  kids to school, rather than waiting on a school bus, to be a part of that  band? Of course, we   d get invited to all the contests because half the  town would go with us. That did a lot for the economy. He taught us  integrity, hard work, pride. I get weepy because he   s not   I still visit  with him once a month, and I get to see him during the winter when he  comes back to his home in Oklahoma City. I just hate to see both of us  have aged, what age is doing to the both of us.  Where does he live in the summer?  Oklahoma City. He spends the summers there and the winters in  Arlington. That   s usually what older   when I worked at McAllen, we  had a lot of people that did that. We called them snowbirds. They didn   t  want the harsh winters, so they come down to the valley to live. It is a  beautiful place to live, beautiful.  How have you seen Tipton change over the years?  You know, Tipton won   t change a whole lot. It   s about the same  population it   s always been. People are still good. I   ll give you an  example. They had a major storm in Tipton two years ago, I think it was.  Everybody lost their power for a couple of weeks. The Tipton home is  there, and they didn   t have any power. My sister and brother-in-law live  out at the edge of town. They had propane, and they had light from the  stove or candlelight, whatever. They were doing the cooking and taking  it to the home. The kids from the home were coming out there and  bathing. But it wasn   t just them. Everybody does that, and they still do  18  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  it.  One of the best things that   ll give you an idea of southwest Oklahoma,  though, Oklahomans have always been one that if they say something to  you, it   s just like taking it to the bank. We had our business since 1959. I  had the store for over thirty-five years myself. When I sold that store,  there was not a signed contract, anywhere, of it. A lot of people say,     What does that mean?    It doesn   t mean a whole lot, but we bought a  couple pieces of property and no signed contract there, either, other than  the piece of paper that shows that it   s ours.  Barbara and I were in Santa Fe, New Mexico, one time. I pulled in to fill  up my Suburban, and we had a nice Suburban. I pulled in, and here   s a  van on the other side of us with a bunch of hippies in it, and they   re  filling up the car. I kept trying to get this gas tank to work with my credit  card. It wouldn   t take it, so I walked in, and I held up my gold credit  card and said,    I need to fill up.    Well, the guy behind the counter  yanked it out of my hand and put it above and says,    Okay. I   ll take care  of you when I get through.    Well, that upset me a little bit. When I got  back out to the tank and I was filling up, the more I thought about it, the  more upset I got. One of the things Dad taught me, put yourself in his  shoes and see why he   s doing it.  So when I walked back in, I told him, I says,    You know, where I was  raised, when someone told you they would do something like that, you  could take it to the bank.    I said,    I   m from Oklahoma. Where I was  raised, somebody told you something like that, you take it to the bank.     The guy says,    You must be from southwest Oklahoma.    I said,    Yes, I  am.    He said,    Well, I am, too.    I said,    Where   d you graduate from?     He said,    Tipton, Oklahoma.    I said,    You   re not serious  Who are  you?    He said,    Jimmy Lindsay.    He graduated two years ahead of me. I  hadn   t seen him in thirty years. But he, even after all that time living out  there, knew what it meant to be from southwest Oklahoma, right?  (Laughter) How many times did you see your dad have to do something  when he needed credit or when he needed some help?  Yes.  He was there waiting on it.  Yes.  Or if someone   s field was ready to be harvested or whatever and they  went into the hospital, you didn   t have to worry about it.  Yes, those Tipton guys came to the rescue when Daddy had to go in for  19  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  heart surgery.  That   s right, and they go take care of his before they do their own.  Yes. Yes, they did.  That spirit is still alive in Oklahoma, and I   m glad to see it. One of the  biggest disappointments I ever had in the state of Oklahoma, though, is  when we had General Motors come to Oklahoma City and we promised  them tax-free status for so many years, and we reneged on it and started  charging them taxes. Now, I   m still convinced that   s why we lost that  big assembly plant. That   s not like     Well, I hope the politicians will get it figured out. They   re trying to  reduce the state income tax because they think it will bring some benefit.  I don   t know. If you have it one way, you   re going to have it the other.  It   s just like the state of Texas. They   ve got better roads. They don   t  have state income tax, but their real estate tax is a whole lot higher.  Yes, it   s got to come from somewhere.  Yes, to support everybody. I have a little more concern where people  think that one group of people owes everybody a living. That   s been  proven that won   t work. If you keep giving a man a fish for all the food  he wants to eat, he   s always going to depend on the fish. You teach him  to fish, he   s going to be able to support hisself. I am not an Obama fan at  all because of that type of thinking and what   s being done. I worry about  my children, my grandchildren, and what they   re going to have to do.  Is there any other history we should talk about?  Oh, yes, we   re really rattling around, aren   t we? (Laughter) If you want  to write a little different history, one man that needs to be given the     well, he   s already been given an awful lot of recognition, but I think you  need to bring these people to memory more often. There   s a man, Dan  Combs, trooper Dan Combs. As a young man, when I would go spend  the weekends with my dad, he and I would ride with Dan, a highway  patrolman, in his car. At that time, he and my dad were team partners in  competition pistol shooting. We would go out on the wildlife refuge  sometimes or back on the Fort Sill military range. Where the cannon  balls would explode, it   d shoot out all these little lead balls. We   d gather  up all those little balls, and then they would melt them down and make  their own bullets out of them.  Dan would get off work, and he   d go home and stand in front of a mirror  20  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  and try to outdraw hisself. (Laughter) Yes, sounds ridiculous. This man  got so good at what he was doing, he not only got good at that, when he  pulled that gun out, he hit whatever he shot at. He got so good at  shooting that you could tie his hands behind him, and he could take a  .22, and you throw something like a dime up in the air and he could  shoot it out of the air with the gun behind him. He could take an  automatic machine gun and put all the bullets right through the middle  of the card. What does all this mean to the average person? Not a whole  lot, except Dan used his talent to travel all over the United States and the  world, teaching troopers how to defend themselves. When he died in  Oklahoma City, there were two honor guards from every state.  Good grief.  Yes. I saw him after I got out of   I was still in college. I went to  Frederick fair, and the highway patrol had a booth set up. It was just a  van, but it was one of the first SWAT-type vehicles. In this van was  scuba tanks and everything to fight a fire or to rescue people underwater,  that type of thing. They were mainly discussing gun safety. To draw a  crowd, Dan would put five balloons on the wall. Then he would draw  and fire. He   d have somebody come up on stage, and, of course, he   d  make sure his gun was empty for this type of thing. Directly in front of  you, he   d stand in front of you, put your hands about twelve inches  apart, and he   d say,    Clap your hands.     He didn   t have a quick release holster or anything. That pistol was  strapped down just like regular gear. He could have that holster between  your hands before your hands touch each other. He could hold a  matchbox straight out and have the gun drawn and have it hit the  matchbox before it fell. He had a troop, a big deal there in Frederick, one  night. Here comes this guy walking up to him, and he watched the show,  and he says,    I   m faster than you are.    Dan said,    Well, that   s fine, but  be careful whenever you shoot.    He said,    No, I can draw faster than  you can.    Dan says,    I   m not here to compete against anybody. I do it to  show safety.    He kept on and kept on and kept on, wanting to draw  against Dan, enough that a crowd came up.     How dare you think        Yes,    How dare you think       Dan said,    Well, do you have your rig  with you?    He said,    Yes, yes, I   ve got it. I   ll be right back.    He took  off, and here he come. Well, while he was gone, Dan put some balloons  on one side for him and some balloons for Dan. Of course, when the kid  comes back, he says,    What   s the other balloons for?       Point number  one,    he says,    do you pull that gun and shoot it without knowing what  you   re shooting at?    He said,    Well, we   re just drawing for speed.    So  21  R. Wilson  T. Penick  they get up, ready to draw. Of course, the kid, he   s looking around. The  way they did competition out there in California is that they watch the  clock, and whenever the clock would hit exactly twelve, they would  draw. Now they ring a buzzer in your ear or whatever. They didn   t have  a clock like that.  Dan said,    How about we just have a partner clap his hands?       Okay,  that   ll be great.    Well, the guy clapped his hands, Dan drew, shot all his  balloons, and had his back in his holster before the guy ever cleared his  holster. When he come up, Dan looked at his rig and says,    What is that?  I haven   t ever seen a holster like that.    Of course he had. It was one  those when he touched the gun, the holster would flap open so you  didn   t have to drag it on up. You just touch the handle and it went up.  That   s how fast he was. But he was able to save an awful lot of troopers     lives, just what they did.  When he died, Smith and Wesson built three different pistols in  commemorative of him. I have held two in my lifetime, and I have  wanted one so bad because when my dad died, I have a whole box full  of medals that they won in team competition and by theirselves. Of  course, when they go to a meet, like, in El Reno or someplace, they  already have the trophies made. They don   t have them engraved who it  is. They just hand you a ribbon or something. If I   d have ever found one  with both of them   s name on it, that   s what I wanted. I was going to put  it in a showcase with a pistol. Lo and behold if I didn   t find a pistol the  other day. It was already what they call a shooter. It had been shot. The  guy that   s in charge of the police force at OU, his dad had it. He got it,  and he wanted to get rid of it because it was taking up space. Man, I  grabbed it faster than a heartbeat. Now I have a Dan Combs  commemorative.  Wow. Where   d you find it, on the internet or     Well, you know, Oklahoma Shooters  Association . I buy and sell guns  quite a bit. I   ve been on Oklahoma Shooters long enough to really get an  ad, myself, and I   d bought a gun off this guy and told him what I was  looking for. He said,    Why don   t you put it on Oklahoma Shooters?    I  said,    I haven   t been on there a lot. Do it for me.    He said,    Okay.    Two  days later, he calls me and says,    I   ve already found that gun for you.    I  said,    You can   t be serious     He said,    Yes.    This guy was cleaning out  his safe, he saw the gun, and said,    I don   t need this. I   ll just put it on the  deal.    Everything just clicked. Click, click. He said,    He doesn   t want  but four hundred dollars for it.    I said,    Give me his name.     Well, I go over to get the gun, he gives me four hundred dollars    worth  of bullets and the holster and so forth with it. (Laughter) The gun itself,  22  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  a trooper will not sell the gun. The highway patrol has got one up there  on display. His badge number was retired, too, the number fourteen.  Nobody will ever carry that badge again. Every time I get stopped by a  highway trooper, we   d decide whether or not I was going to get a ticket,  and then I always ask them,    Do you know who Dan Combs was? Do  you know where I could get a pistol?    All of them say,    You   re not  going to get a pistol unless you   re one of the lucky ones that originally  got one of the pistols.     How many did they make, do you think?  I don   t know. That   d be a good thing to research. I understand there   s  been three of them that   s made. I got a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver.  I shot it for the first time yesterday. Good-shooting gun.  Was he born and raised in Lawton?  No, but he   s from Oklahoma. I say he wasn   t. I think that was just  maybe one of his first stations.  That   s neat.  We were riding one night with him just outside of Cache, Oklahoma.  That was back when the old road was there, before they built the new  highway. We pulled up, and there was about ten head of cattle on the  road. They got out, and they got all the cattle off the road. Just as they  shut the gate and got back in the car, here comes this car flying over the  top of the hill, doing at least ninety miles an hour. Back in the    50s, that  was pretty fast. Man, they flew around, and we finally stopped the car     or as we went into Cache, there was a whole bunch of dust. They  figured,    Well, he   s pulled off or something,    but there was still a set of  lights ahead of him, so he had to go catch him and came back. We pulled  up to this place. It was a bar or whatever it was. He got out to go in. Dad  looked at me, (we were sitting in the back seat) and he says,    Do not say  a word.    (Laughs) I said,    You got that     I wasn   t about to, anyway.  He brought this kid back out, and I   ll tell you what, if I   ve ever seen fire  coming out of a man   s eyes, it was coming out of his. Come to find  out   I mean, he read him the Riot Act and wrote him a ticket, of course.  But what he was so upset about is that he said,    I   ve got a daughter the  same age as y   all.    There were five kids in that car. He said,    You would  have all been killed, and my daughter could   ve been one of you.    You  could tell what was motivating him, boy howdy. Other than that, the  most kindest, gentlest man you   d ever meet in your life. He was a good  model.  23  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  Did he die of old age or     Yes, or some kind of something. It wasn   t an accident or a gun battle or  anything. He did shoot hisself one time. A 1911 model was bad about  flipping off the safety. As much as he talked safety, he had been out at  the range by himself shooting. He stuck that gun in his belt, and it went  off. Shot him through the side. He drove to the hospital. Didn   t have any  ID on him. They wouldn   t take him in because of his bullet wound. He  had to drive to a second hospital. (Laughs) If you were to recall what  person had more influence on your life than anybody else besides your  dad     Well, some of those guys there at Tipton, John Winkler and     That   s cheating  (Laughter) We were lucky. We went to an oyster fry in  Frederick the other night. That   s another good article to write up on.  They   ve had this oyster fry at Frederick every year. There are busloads  of people coming from Oklahoma City to eat those oysters. Big draw.  We used to do it ourselves about every quarter. Dad would bring in a  five-gallon bucket of oysters, and we   d have oyster fries at somebody   s  house, remember? You didn   t go home on Sunday or Wednesday night.  You went to somebody   s house and visited, ate with the family. You  know that land sold this weekend where the old river bridge used to be.  Did you ever hear what it brought?  About fifteen hundred an acre.  Really?  Yes.  I thought it would   ve brought more than that.  Well, Joe Kelly or somebody from Humphrey area, I think, bought it.  Oh, did he?  It was around that much. That   s a lot of money for river bottom     Yes it is. But that particular place will probably   what was it, 123  acres?  Two hundred and something thousand dollars was the total.  I bet you he could get     24  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  I think it was seventy-something acres, but I haven   t multiplied it out.  No, it was over a hundred acres.  Two hundred and eighty-six thousand dollars was the total that Dale  calculated, at least.  But just what he could get on deer lease off of it would be about ten  thousand dollars a year, probably, just for a hunting lease on it. Of  course, that   s what   s making most of the payment on land anymore.  That   s one way the area has changed over the years: the hunting.  Oh, yes. Yes. Before, my father-in-law nearly lost his place. The  government was going to take it back over about twenty years ago.  Everybody was losing their farms. The government was going in and  taking them. I kept watching somebody that had land, and I knew        Why didn   t he lose his, and why did he lose his?    So I started finding  out what they were doing to keep from losing their land. I saved their  farm by doing the same thing, just following through on it, another place  where banks could get to you. I don   t like that type of thing at all, when  people take advantage of other people.  Like during the Depression when so much of that was going on.  Well, yes, and whenever my mother and her sister had this falling out,  like, fifteen years ago now, twelve or fifteen years ago. My mother and  her sisters had always gotten along really well. This particular sister had  more money than she knew what to do with. My mother had been down  in Houston taking care of her, and she was flat dragging my mother  down. I said,    You   re coming home.    What they did, Louise came home  with her to live. Boy, she had high plans.    We   re going to buy a new  Cadillac. We   re going to live together.    They had all these plans. Well,  Louise bought a condo in Edmond because Annie had one, and Jimmy  and Sharon were going through this hard time back then, and they had  lost nearly everything of theirs. Louise gave them some money so they  could move out because she didn   t like their adopted boy they had there.  She didn   t like kids. She never did like kids. She raised one son. But  anyway, she gave them enough money to go out, and they bought this  place of their own.  Later on, she went back to Amarillo and got with one of these cousins  that said,    You ought to get that money back.    So she goes to Sharon  and Jim and wants the money back. Well, they haven   t got the money.  They were just struggling back then, so she knew she wasn   t going to  get anything of it. She called me and tried to get me to persuade   . I  25  said,    Look, I got nothing to do with this.    I said,    I   m going to take care  of my mother.    Lo and behold, she knew the only way she was going to  get it was to bring my mother into it. We were very fortunate after Dad  died. The good Lord blessed us real well on what we did with  investments from him. I took over with the case. Sharon and Jim had  hired some little ol    lawyer from Frederick that wasn   t doing worth a  flip. Throughout the whole deal, she   d stopped making tax payments on  this condo, completely. She didn   t care anything about it, so she quit  paying the taxes on it.  After I handled the case, I saw that I had two months to go in and pay  those taxes and still save that condo. What happened is that a big bunch  of lawyers from Florida was going in around the state, and any time a  condo or piece of property or somebody   s homestead would come up,  they would interpret this law to where they could go ahead and buy it.  What they would do, they would turn right around and sell it to  somebody back in Oklahoma for like ten thousand dollars, and they   re  out of it. I went in and told them, I said,    I want to pay the taxes on the  condo.    The clerk says,    Well, you can   t do that. It   s already been sold.     I said,    You sold it too quick.    I knew the law because I   d had a friend  in Texas who became a millionaire buying tax relief property, and I  looked into it, too. When I got to comparing the two, I knew it could be  done in Oklahoma.  Anyway, I said,    You sold it too quick.    She said,    No, that   s the way  it   s done.    I said,    You did it too quick.    She said,    Well, it   s already  been sold.    I said,    Well, you need to read the law.       Well, no        Anyway, she takes me back, Oklahoma County, back to the office where  the state attorney general has his assistant   s own office in there. The big  ol    office is as big as the inside of this house nearly. He leans back in his  chair and says,    We   ve handled a thousand of these. You can   t get it  back.    I know it   s wrong. I looked and him, and I said,    You watch. I   ll  spend a lot of money getting it done, but it   s wrong, and you know it   s  wrong, and it needs to be corrected.     So, sure enough, I got to checking on it, and there   s certain things you  have to do to make it legal, such things as you   ve got to run an ad in the  paper, where the house is, in the local paper so many times. The condo is  Edmond. They were running it in the Bethany paper. You have to  contact every single Clemons or Smith that Sharon had paid the taxes to  for her in the county. They never went to Sharon   s house. They never  checked with the utilities in town because Sharon was paying the  utilities for her, and they never did go to the utility office to check and  see where this Louise Clemons was. You have to go to everybody   s  house and knock on the door and talk to them. They   d show they were in  Shawnee, Oklahoma, and fifteen minutes later they were back in  26  R. Wilson  T. Penick  Oklahoma City. I just had arrows on a map. There   s no way they  could   ve done it.  I had all that prepared, and I needed a lawyer to get that part done. Dr.   Noble  Ballard over here had been using a guy to handle some of his  cattle, and he had stole some other cattle. The bank was stupid enough to  accuse Dr. Ballard of being involved in it and sued him. Of course,  Noble got this lawyer, Snow, in Oklahoma City and made them pay real  good for defamation of character. When I went to ask Noble, I said,     Who   s a good lawyer?    That   s who he sicced me on. I went up there to  see him. He looked at everything I had and said,    You   ve got a case.    I  said,    Yes, sir, I know I do. I know it   s wrong, and it needs to be cleared  up.    He said,    I   ll take it, but I   m going to tell you right now, I normally  represent the other side of it.    I said,    Well, you know how to argue it,  then, don   t you?    I   d already checked him out, and I said,    You   re the  one that I   ll depend on.     So was this against the state attorney general?  Yes, I had to sue the state of Oklahoma, the whole state of Oklahoma,  not just the attorney general. It applied to every county. State law. He  said,    Well, I   ll take it home.    He did, and the first time it came to court,  they had to find in my defense. Said,    He wasn   t doing what he was  supposed to do. It   s done wrong.    In the meantime, I had gotten in touch  with Janet Wright, who was our treasurer here. The one in Cleveland  County, the one over at Mangum, I knew both those ladies. Well, after I  got it done and it was a court case proving them wrong, when they went  to the treasurers association meeting, said,    Here   s the precedent that   s  been set. This is the way this needs to be worded to keep it from  happening.    When all the treasuries in the state of Oklahoma approved it  and took it straight to the governor, he signed it right then. It was law.  I go back up to the court clerk   s office, and I told him   by this time, the  time had passed, but they had to give me the condo back because that   s  what the lawsuit was about. They had a little eleven-and-a-half-by-eight-and-  a-half sheet of paper there  that said  the law had been changed ever  since this date. Well, a little ol    clerk was over there, and I did like this,  and she walked over. I said,    You remember me? It   s been two years.        Well, you look familiar, but not really.    I said,    You remember me  telling you I was going to get that law changed?    You know what she  did?  I get weepy about this because I feel so good about it. Janet had told me  before, anytime something like that would come up, she would go find  that person. She said,    I have never lost a piece of property,    because  she knew everybody. They were raised in this county. She found a guy  27  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  in a nursing home. His nephew was supposed to have been paying the  taxes. He wasn   t. She told him. He said,    Get my checkbook.    The lady  stuck her hand across the counter. She shook my hand and said,    Thank  you.    She said,    You don   t know how many farms, homesteads, and  ranches have been lost because of that.    So I feel good about it, and  that   s how we got a condo in Edmond. That was my fee for handling the  case and everything else.  Anybody get put behind bars over all that?  Oh, no. They weren   t doing something illegal. It   s just the way they  were interpreting it. These lawyers are real good about doing it to their  benefit. I   ve learned that the hard way a lot of times.  So what you did there is get it clarified real well so they can   t continue  that pattern.  They re-wrote the law. They clarified the wording in the law and said,     This is what it means.    That   s what they took to the governor, and he  signed it. That changed the exact dates. Even if you buy a piece of  distressed property which you cannot bid on until it   s overdue, I think  it   s     Seven or eight years?  No, no, if you don   t pay taxes, I think within two years it goes before the  court. Then you   ve got two more years to go back and pay it. If they  haven   t paid it, you   ve bought it. You   ve paid the taxes. It doesn   t  legally become yours until two years later, and then they have to pay  you a certain percent on the amount of money that you got into it plus  the taxes. You make money doing that, but they were buying it and  turning around and selling it back. Well, that got this law firm out of the  loop. Makes it more difficult to bring charges against them or to clear it  up. Now, everybody says,    You   ve got a condo in Edmond? You   re rich.  You can afford that?    I said,    Well, it costs more to maintain, insurance  and everything, anymore.    That   s another thing. It costs me  157.17 a  month. I   ve got a grandson that lives a mile down the road, exactly one  mile down the road. We   d spend that much money on motel rooms, plus  the taxes, and then all the maintenance on the outside is maintained by  this group. We are finding out   you   ve retired now?  No, still at it. I don   t know if I   ll retire since I   m self-employed.  Well, you ought to think awful hard about it because Barbara and I have  retired. We sold the store. I had set everything up to where I knew about  what it would take for us to go ahead and have a comfortable retirement.  28  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  We had an interest in that place, her and her sister, at the homeplace  over there, and she would be getting about the age sometime within a  five-, ten-year period of time. We   d inherit that. We hope it   d be delayed  as long as possible, of course, but my mother, too, my part of the trust,  that we   d be able to do all right.  When you get on a set amount of income from your taxes that you   ve  earned in what   s coming from your social security, if the government  keeps going up on your Medicare payments, it   s going to reach a point  pretty quick when your income is set at this level. (Gestures) And at this  level when you retire, you budgeted to maintain all your expenses as  long as it stays at this level. Well, when your fixed expenses go up like  this and you start drawing from what savings or having to sell some of  your property or whatever you wanted the kids to inherit in order to keep  this standard of living but still pay these government expenses, it   s going  to disappear pretty quick. What I   m fixing to take to the few senators  and representatives that I have as friends, I think that what needs to  happen is when you die, the amount you   re paying for your Medicare  taxes is froze right there because teachers haven   t gotten a cost of living  increase ever since Barbara retired ten years ago. That dollar amount  should be froze right there so it can   t be increased. If somebody is  working longer, they   re paying in the amount of taxes into it at the time  where it will pay more, but that dollar amount ought to be set and froze.  When you retire?  Yes, when you retire. Somebody goes,    That   s too much paperwork.     It   s not anything with computers. They   ve got other plans to do it. Major  corporations have it where it stays at a certain price. I think that would  solve a lot of problems. It makes sense.  Yes, choke you out if they just keep raising the rates.  It is, and we   re beginning to feel it real bad. I could do it.  So it   s the Medicare expense that keeps creeping up?  Oh, yes. Yes. What Obama is trying to pull on us now, he   s trying to  pass it now that if we were to sell this house in 2013, we have to pay a  major tax on it as soon as we sell it. Now if you sell your house, if you  go ahead and invest it into another house or residence like that, there   s  no tax on it at all. He charges somebody a 30 percent tax on it. The  government doesn   t have 30 percent coming, as far as I   m concerned.  You know yourself that they spend more money than what they should  be doing anyway. Your insurance companies here in the state of  Oklahoma have gotten to where they won   t insure a house with a  29  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  wooden roof. All of a sudden, they   ve all written this plan   we   ve  always owned a house. I always make sure that my roof would be totally  replaceable. Hard to find now. If you do, you   re going to pay a premium  for it because they won   t depreciate it out.  We had these two major claims this last year, so the insurance company  drops me. Now is a bad time to drop me because I   m going to have a  new roof, and half the house is brand new. But the insurance company  says,    Well, you   ve had two major claims. We need to drop you.    I  don   t think that ought to be allowed, but they   re going to do it. The next  insurance company says,    Oh, boy, we   ll be able to get him because he  got dropped.    So insurance runs from seventeen hundred to over two  thousand a year. It   s just things like that.  So do you recommend early retirement instead of     No.     waiting until the     No, I don   t at all. As long as you   re working and you enjoy what you   re  doing, don   t retire at all.  And then get the higher income from social security?  Probably. Barbara couldn   t do it. Barbara   s legs have flat give out on  her. She was taught in school that you don   t sit down in first grade.  From the time she walked in there, she got up there every day, she never  sat down. Back in her closet, they used to store the football uniforms up  in her closet. Water leaked back there. There was black mold growing  all over that closet back there for years. The year she retired, they went  in and completely redid that whole part of the school. She had a major  class action lawsuit she could   ve brought against the school system,  then. (Laughs)  I   m real familiar with the state of Oklahoma. In fact, when I bought this  condo   whenever a piece of property changes hands, see, they can   t  raise your real estate taxes except something like 1.5 percent per year,  but when you go in and buy it and you pay the taxes on it, that   s the  price you get it at. They didn   t know what price I paid for that condo,  but, man, my taxes on that condo went up from like seven hundred  dollars a year to like eighteen hundred dollars a year.  The property tax?  Yes. I   m thinking that little ol    attorney general up there was saying,  30  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  L. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick     I   ll teach you, Mr. Penick.    (Laughter) And he did it.  So they reset the property tax value when it changes hands, I guess.  Oh, yes.  Bring it up to the latest     Yes. Just like what you   re fixing to look at (I assume, what you   re fixing  to look at) when your mother passes away, what is it now? Four million  dollars, or is it still two or three million dollars that you can inherit  without paying any estate taxes. He   s trying to do away with that. Want  to hear another story about taking the bull by the horns?  Sure. (Laughs)  Had a fire in the store one night, and I called my real estate agent. Said,     Is the fire truck there?    I looked out, and he   s sitting in his car across  the street. I visited with him the next day and he said,    Just go ahead and  list everything that   s damaged, and we   ll take care of it.    I did, and he  kept stalling and kept stalling and kept stalling. Come to find out, he was  keeping my premium in his pocket and hadn   t bought my insurance. I  had a binder, though. When he did mine, he gave me a binder, which is a  contract showing you got it.  So, come to find out, I had grounds to sue him. He   d been mayor of this  town twice. I had sat up with him at night and prayed with him when he  was in the hospital. Everybody loved him, James Starr. Barbara and his  daughter taught next door to each other for years. I   m having a hard time  approaching this guy. Then I get to finding out, all of a sudden, a lot of  people in town, whenever I started raising cane about it, I found out that  the   what do they call the place where they get grant money to build a  hotel down there for the older people to live in? He had the insurance for  that. He hadn   t paid it. He was keeping the premium for that. Tom Steed  Reservoir     So was he trying to be an insurance company     No, he was just spending the money.  But he was going to have to pay a claim eventually.  Usually, what little claims he would get in, he   d have the money to go  ahead and pay those or get them to settle for a lesser amount. This is the  thing. This is something that goes on quite a bit. The Tom Steed  Reservoir, he had their insurance claim. That reservoir, Altus, Frederick,  31  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  and Snyder gets water from there. He was keeping that money in his  pocket. I forget what the   condo, that one, and some other big place. I  got to looking, and, you know, if one person would have drowned off  that boat dock over there, that lets every citizen in Altus, Frederick, and  Snyder open to being sued because there wasn   t insurance on it. When I  went to him, there wasn   t anything he could do about it. He even  admitted it. When I caught him he said,    Not anything I can do.    So I  went to the Oklahoma Tax Commission and sat in there. Guy named  Jerry, he said,    Well, I don   t know what we can do about it.    I said,    I  know what you can do about it. I   ve got a binder here. You better get in  touch with the insurance company.    The more I investigated, he had  already had his wrist slapped twice before     Starr had?     yes, and didn   t have his license pulled. I went to him with a class  action lawsuit that I was going to bring against the state of Oklahoma  again. He should never have been allowed to keep on doing it after the  first offense, and you let him do it. This is the third time. No, people. I  mean, I had somebody from their office in my store every week until  mine was paid for. I had total   you build up a bunch of steam with all  those starters and generators and stuff, and rust. You   re not going to get  as much for them. They paid my complete inventory.  Who was paying? The state?  The state ended up having to do it. There is a policy, sort of like when a  bank goes under. The Federal Reserve sets aside so much money to pay  for everybody that has money in the bank. Same way with insurance  companies.  So you went to the state insurance commissioner, probably.  Right, I did. I love to do that. Don Quixote, that   s one of my email  addresses: donquixote sbcglobal. (Laughter) It   s wrong. When you see  things that   s wrong    With a business, I would look at my phone bill  every quarter and compare my prices, what I was being charged per  minute, with somebody else. A lot of times, you could switch. I never  did have to switch from AT T, but all I   d do is say I   m fixing to, and  they would lower my rate back down to whatever the rest were because  they keep trying to raise it on me like Cablecom does. I notice this  5.95  charge on it. I call them, and I say,    What   s the  5.95 for?       That   s for  the internet deal you agreed to take.    No. I said,    I didn   t approve of  anything like this.       We   ll take it off.    I said,    You go back and look at  about how long I   ve had it and take all that off.       Well, no, I don   t know  if we can do that.    I said,    I advise you to do that.     32  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  Well, I went up to the bank the next day. We have what we call a board  meeting, and here   s about ten of us old fogies around town that gather at  the bank. I told them,    Y   all bring your phone bill tomorrow.       What  for?    I said,    I want to check something.    So everybody brought their  phone bill. About 80 percent of us had that  5.95 on there. I said,    You  know what it is?       No.    I said,    Some gal probably called you one night  when you sat down at supper, wanted something, you said,    No, don   t  call me,    and hung up. She said,    Well, I   ll teach you.    She   s probably  getting paid on commission. She checks    yes,    and you start getting  billed for it.     You just don   t notice it.  You don   t notice it. Nobody pays that much attention to  5.95. If I   m  buying a control for a TV set, I want to pay for it. It   s ten dollars a  month? You   ll never get it paid for. Your daddy would enjoy this kind  of thing. So here I go back up to the state capitol. I   ve been visiting  with   the guy that owned all this land here was Bob Kerr. He was  senator at the time. His son lives right across the street. He and I are  friends. I   m in there visiting. We go out to lunch. I tell him I need to go  over to the corporation commission.    What for?    I start telling him  about it.  I call over, and usually in something like this, there is three corporation  commissioners that are all in the office, and they cover different parts of  the state. The person that really gets it done is the major secretary, major  clerk, so I called her and said,    I want to take you out to dinner.    Now,  that was unusual. I said,    I got something I want to discuss with you.     Then I said,    I   m over here at Senator Kerr   s office right now. I can  come on over if you can   t go to lunch.    Of course, when I mention his  name,    Yes.    Well, she grabbed her secretary to go with us and be on  the safe side. Either that or she heard how wild-man I was, I guess.  (Laughter) I wish.  Anyway, we go to lunch, and I start telling her about this. She says,     You know, I brought that up to them a couple months ago, and I didn   t  hear anything about it.    I said,    They better, because this is going to be  changed. I want to speak to them.    She said,    Whenever you go back,  you call me in about thirty minutes or so.    I did, and they said,    Come  on.    They didn   t come theirself, but they sent their underling. I  explained it to them. They all sat there and listened. I said,    This needs  to be taken care of. The main thing, you shouldn   t have let it happen to  begin with.     Yes, they   re there to police that sort of thing.  33  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  R. Wilson  T. Penick  I said,    I think all of you are up for a major lawsuit.    They got it  changed that very next month. They had to call AT T, made them  refund everybody. That had been going on for years. No telling how  much AT T had made off that deal.  I just wonder if someone at the corporation commission was getting a  kickback on it or something.  Well, you know they were. Just like this last year, you might not be  aware of it, but it was going to be that every single prescription you had  filled had to be refilled through Lubbock if it was going through  Medicare. You don   t think that didn   t take some in-pocket? When we  got to investigating that, sure enough, they got that passed. It was going  to take place the first of the month. The pharmacists didn   t find out  about it until November. As of the first of the year, this contract had  been signed that all that was going to go. Little drug store over here at  Granite, who 90 percent of their customers were employees of the prison  there, was going to have to go out of business, so we had to jump on it to  get that changed real quick. A bunch of us called them and told them to  do something about it. Whenever I actually got to visit with some  friends, they said that they   d had a representative in on their meetings.  They said,    Who were they?    Senators even had OU do a study on it to  see how much money the state would lose. It   s up in the millions  So  they got that nonsense stopped.  Well, there   s been so much Medicare problems.  Oh, yes   -------  -------
