 Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Today is September 14, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and I   m in Billings, Oklahoma,  today to speak with Drew Mason regarding his memories of former  Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator Henry Bellmon. Thank you for  coming today.  Others present include Drew   s wife Janet and Henry  Bellmon   s daughters Pat Hoerth, Gail Wynne, and Ann McFerron.   My pleasure.  Let   s get started by having you tell us a little bit about yourself, where  you were born, and then we   ll work forward.  I   m an Iowan by birth. I was born in 1929 in Boone, Iowa. Moved to  Des Moines when I was young and then moved on from there. Went to  the University of Iowa, went to the army from Iowa, got out of the army,  had no idea what I was going to do. I married the farmer   s daughter and  farmed for four years. And we weren   t doing too well with that, and so I  had an opportunity to go to work for Investors Diversified, which I did. I  worked for a year in Grinnell, Iowa and then had an opportunity to  become a trainee in a fundraising firm out of Kansas City. And one thing  led to another.  I moved into a different fundraising firm and in 1960, I think it was,  Henry Bellmon got in touch with our firm to come to Tulsa to raise  money for the Republican Party, and the firm sent me down to do that. It  was a successful campaign. It was a ten week campaign, as I recall. And  then I left and did other campaigns during the year. A year later, Henry  Bellmon at that time, then became state chairman   or was state  chairman. He got in touch with the company and asked for them to send  me back to Oklahoma City this time to raise money for the Republican  Party there. They did, and I did. I stayed in Oklahoma at that point.  5  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  And it   s an interesting thing. It   s interesting to me, anyway, how I got  here, or why I stayed here, because he tells the story a little bit different  in the book. My story is this, that the fundraising program that my  company put on has a format. It was a boilerplate, and the very middle  day of the campaign, no matter what you   re raising money for, the  middle day of the campaign was your kickoff dinner, and you couldn   t  deviate from that. That was your dinner and all your volunteers would  come and get motivated to go raise money. Well, as it turned out, the  middle day of the campaign was the night of precinct meetings. And if I  were to proceed by having my dinner that night, I wouldn   t have my  precinct republicans there. And so I called the company and I said,    I  have to deviate from the plan because of this reason,    and they said,    No  way. That plan is proven time and time again and don   t deviate from it.     And I argued with them a bit, and they wouldn   t relent.  So Henry was standing in the room at the time, and I was talking to  Kansas City on the phone. I put my hand over the receiver and I said,     Henry,      I guess I called him Henry at that time      Would you hire me  if I quit the company?    and he said,    Yes.    And I said,    I quit.    In short,  I quit and told them why again. Well, that   s my story, but in Henry   s  book, he tells the story that he and John Tyler had decided that they  would ask me to go to work for them so that they wouldn   t have to pay  the company all these big bucks just to send me down when they could  hire me for cheap. And so that   s what they did. And so my version of  this is slightly different, but it all works together. But, anyway, that   s  how I got to Oklahoma.  You felt strongly enough to quit?  Well, yes, I did. I mean, I enjoyed working here in Oklahoma. I liked  Oklahoma, and my family was with me here in Oklahoma. Yes, the job  itself, working for that company, we   d be on the road all the time. We  would start a contract on Monday morning and maybe eight weeks later  or ten weeks later at five o   clock on Friday afternoon, the contract would  be over, and Janet would have packed up the kids and the car. And at  five o   clock on Friday afternoon, we   d head out for our next campaign,  which would start on Monday morning. And we moved from like  Missouri to Virginia over the weekend, or Virginia to New York. And  we moved from Illinois to Oklahoma. And over that weekend, you had  to move, and you had to find a place to live, and you had to move in and  be ready to go to work on Monday morning. And that was kind of hair-raising.  So, anyway, I was glad to stay in Oklahoma. And Henry and I  and John Tyler, we all got along real well.  What were your first impressions when you met him the very first time?  6  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  I   ve thought about that and honestly, I can   t remember the first time I  met him. But I do in general have the feeling that we were very  compatible. We just got along well. I knew what he wanted, and he  figured I knew what I was doing, and we just got along well.  Farming background helped a little bit, maybe?  It could be. It could be.  Talk a little bit about the campaign. What was your role in that and     In the first governor   s campaign?  Yes.  Well, before the campaign, I had been the executive secretary of the  Republican Party and he   d been the state chairman, and so we had that  working relationship going. And we had programs to recruit people, and  we had programs to raise money, and so establishing a campaign is  basically, just more of the same because we were working with the same  people with the organization that we built. But in the campaign, a little  more formally, my function was pretty much to coordinate the efforts of  the staff and raise money, basically. Henry was in touch with Wayne  Mackey, an old school friend, who came to us from the Daily  Oklahoman, took a leave of absence. And Wayne Mackey was the guy  who was working the strategy and worked closely with Henry on the  getting out among them, whereas I was back in the headquarters doing  the organizational work. And that   s basically what I always did for him,  raised money and did the organization.  Were you present for election night?  Oh, yes. We were. I don   t remember exactly that particular election  night. (Laughs) But I do remember that we walked from someplace, I  imagine the Sheraton Hotel, over to the Sears building or maybe it was  the other way around, after we were sure we had won. And I have this  photograph of Henry and Shirley walking, going from one place to the  other with a crowd of people around them. Frank Davies is in the  picture, Darla is in the picture, I think, and some young people. And then  there   s this old fellow, big fellow, he   s holding his hat like this and his  eyes are closed, and he just looks disgusted, and he   s the typical old  guard democrat. That picture was so great. It just set the whole scene  with the news people, republicans coming in, the old guard democrat on  the way out. It was just perfect. But that was a fun night.  Were there any particular rules that you were following that Henry set  7  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  himself for the campaign in regards to cash vs. checks or that type of  thing?  According to what kind of rules?  Any kind. Like, some people will take cash or would they prefer a check?  That type of thing?  I don   t recall that we ever talked about those things. One situation, there  was a firm in town that was well-known to be a democrat-supporting  firm, and we didn   t think too much of it, and we didn   t like them. And  yet, they always paid the winner, and about the time they figured we  were going to win the election or had a good chance, they came around  with a check for  3,000. We were advised by the senator, he didn   t want  that money, we wouldn   t take it, and so everybody knew that we weren   t  supposed to take that money. But they kept coming with this check and  at one point, it was almost like they were chasing somebody around in  that picture and trying to give them this money, this check, and nobody  would ever take it. (Laughs) And years later, I was talking to one of the  principals from that company, and he denied it ever happened.  (Laughter) But, anyway, money wasn   t a serious problem, because there  wasn   t a whole lot of it, as I recall.  That was the first campaign?  That was the first campaign.  And once he was elected, what was your role?  We went into the governor   s office and my role was, basically, what it  had always been. I was a republican political hack. I was a paid  republican operative, and so when I went into the governor   s office, I  was responsible for dealing with the Republican Party and coordinating  the effort with appointments, trying to get the Republican Party to give  us recommendations for republicans appointees, and trying to explain to  the stupid republican organization why we had to have a democrat every  now and then. They were dead set against us appointing any democrats  to anything. And Henry was in the position of having to live with  democrats, like 100 percent democrats, and we couldn   t get an  appointment through the Senate without a democrat senator approving of  it.  We had to be flexible, and we couldn   t be hard-nosed about it. And, boy,  I   ll tell you what, the republican organization just didn   t understand that.  Al Snipes was the county chairman at that time, and Al and I were  always at each other   s throats. As it worked out, he and I became very  8  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  good friends, and he   s a great guy. But at that time, he was hard-nosed,  and it was tough dealing with him. But my job was to deal with the  republicans and to organize the effort on appointments, for the most part.  And during that time period, how often would you interact with the  governor?  Oh, like almost daily. If I didn   t talk to him personally, he was always  sending me little memos, little notes. Gosh, when you contacted me I  started looking for all that stuff, and I was going to give a bunch of it to  you, but I couldn   t find it. And it   s around somewhere. If I find it, I   ll  have her send it to you. But he would send me little memos. I remember  one I recommended somebody, and he wrote back a little memo and said  something very sharp and curt, to the point that,    I don   t understand how  you could even think of him in this position,    or something like that. But  we communicated frequently, all the time.  In a situation like that, would you win?  Would I win? Would he win? Oh, he always won. (Laughter) Yes, for  sure. But he was a very reasonable person. You could persuade him with  logic, no problem there.  He would at least listen to the argument?  Yes, he would. He would, but I don   t ever, ever remember having a big  discussion with him about one side or my side against his side. I was too  smart to let it get there, maybe. I don   t know. We just didn   t have that  kind of a problem.  Did you ever beat him to the office in the morning?  I don   t think so. I don   t think so. He   s famous for that two-thirty  morning. He was there early.  I take it you had an office in the Capitol?  Yes.  Was it in proximity with his?  Yes. We had that suite of offices. Do you remember it? We come in the  front door where the secretary would be. The office was kind of long.  You   d go down a hallway and my office would be on the left and Dale  Cook and Bob Haught were on the right. And then you   d get on down to  his office which was on the very end with his secretary down there. I  9  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  think we only had something like twelve members at that time. The  second time we went in, our staff was more like fifty. It was big because  we had a lot more responsibilities. We had a lot of that money that the  state had won in a lawsuit that we had to deal with. I   d forgotten, then  we had a whole staff to deal with that. We had a lot more people the  second time around.  First time around, it was very family-like, our little group. We   d been in  the campaign together. Liz Morgan worked for a newspaper down in  southeast Oklahoma, a famous Oklahoma publisher down there, Liz  worked for him. He called Henry one day and said,    I have this  volunteer for you, if you need a volunteer.    Henry said,    Sure enough.     So Liz came to work for us, we thought, as a volunteer. And about the  first payday when she didn   t get a paycheck, she let me know right off  she was not a volunteer. (Laughter) And she   s been with us ever since.  She stayed with us through the governor   s office and campaigns and  Senate office and great person.  Do you remember any of the top issues during that first term as  governor?  Bussing was an issue at that time, as I recall. Where these girls were  going to go to school was an issue. Just dealing with the democrat  legislature was a big issue, and it seems to me that   s all I can  immediately think about. I think of J.D. McCarty and how I was always  concerned that he was fixing to do us in one way or the other. Lloyd  Rader was big in our life. Lloyd Rader and Henry had a great working  relationship, and I think it was partly because of Lloyd Rader   s  friendship and influence that we managed to get through that first four  years as well as we did. I don   t know if he   d agree with that or not, but it  seemed like that. He would have a lot of influence.  Any particular favorite memories from those four years, anything that  just stands out?  Yes. I have this one dumb memory. We were in my office one day, and I  can   t remember what the issue was, but something happened that just  pleased me no end, and I was so glad that it happened. And I whooped it  up, and I ran into my office, and I leaped up, and I grabbed the frame of  the door and swung my legs up, and I slipped and fell and broke my arm.  (Laughter) And a day or two later, Annie  Bellmon  and I, who also had  a broken arm, had our picture taken together. That was so dumb   (Laughter) Well, we had a lot of fun in that first four years. We went to  governors    conferences, and those were always exciting and interesting.  Our wives got to go with us some. But what was this, fifty, sixty years  ago?  10  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  It   s been   going on fifty, yes.  A long time ago. It   s like it was a great time, and it   s just a big feeling,  almost, now, that it was. But being specific about what happened is very  difficult.  Well, you had no idea when you first came to Oklahoma in 1960 that it  would last this long, I guess.  No, when we first came to Oklahoma it was a job, and when we stayed  in Oklahoma, it was good. And one of the things that I   ve thought about  from time to time, I have never ever worried about what was going to  happen if we didn   t win the election. It just never occurred to me, and I  think one of the reasons it never occurred to me is because I just kind of  felt like Henry Bellmon was going to win. I never thought about him  losing, ever. When he first decided to run for the governor   s office in the  first place, he probably thought a lot about it. I didn   t think a whole lot  about it.  The thing that we did think about was that we couldn   t find anybody else  to do it. I remember we ran the list. Reuben Sparks had done it before,  and Joe what   s-his-name from up at Pawnee was a consideration, but all  these people had reasons why they really weren   t good candidates. And  just kicking those names around and eliminating them and nobody left  but Henry Bellmon. And John Tyler had been pushing him to do this for  some time. So there I was, and as I remember, and I may be wrong about  this, but I think when he decided that he was going to do it, he put a  mortgage of some sort on the farm and borrowed money to do it, which  took a lot of faith. But we didn   t think we were a shoo-in, for sure, but  we didn   t think about losing, either. We just did it because he had to do  it, and so he did it and won.  And that was a good four years, and then were you surprised when he  decided to run for senator?  I   ve wondered about that, too, but it seems to me that once you   re in the  political arena like that and events occur. He was governor for four  years, and then he was out for two years. Well, what do you do? He  comes back to the farm, but he   d also been in the legislature, and he was  a political person of some note at that time   national note, because of  the fact that he got elected in Oklahoma of all places, a republican. So  you can   t turn your back on it. Actually, you just kind of automatically  consider yourself without thinking too much about it, that you   re in the  political business to do what you have to do. And being out of office,  two years to go, what   s next? Senate. Mike Monroney would be up, he   d  11  Gail Wynne  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  been there a long time. You can easily work up a case against Mike  Monroney so we did it, and it   s a natural thing for him to do. He did it,  and he ran. Do you all remember him straining over these kinds of  decisions?  My memory is that some of the staff wanted him to run the two years  prior to that, run while he was still governor. And I don   t know whose  seat that would have been, but there was a senatorial election the year  that he went out, and that some people wanted him to go straight through  and Mother and I lobbied against it.  I have no recollection of that. None. Let   s see. Bob Kerr died on New  Year   s Day and Howard Edmondson   so it would have been Fred  Harris, wouldn   t it? Fred Harris was in office when we got up there.  Yes. So I don   t know.  Well, was that campaign much different from the one for governor?  Yes, it was basically, because we were a known quantity at this time  with a great reputation. Henry didn   t have a great legislative history as  governor, but everybody recognized him for what he was, and that was a  man of honesty and integrity. That was his shtick, you might say.  (Laughs) He just was, and people knew it and liked him for it. So the  campaign for the Senate was different, was different. We were a real  known quantity and a legitimate candidate, and Mike Monroney was so  easy. Mike Monroney   s campaign was a disaster, in my opinion.  Anyway...  And I take it you   d made the decision to move to DC with him?  Yes, but we   d been there. You see, after we got out of the governor   s  office, I was out of a job, basically. Although, when we were in the  governor   s office, I had been kind of public as an employee of the  governor. I had been kind of public about encouraging republicans and  all our appointees and whoever to get out and work for Dewey Bartlett,  and it got into the newspapers that I was doing this. As it worked out  then, Dewey got elected. And so one day I was still in my office and  Dewey came in to see the governor. Well, he hadn   t been in the office  all that much, and so he got lost, sidetracked, and he got shoveled  around, and he walked into my office by mistake. And there he was,  standing in front of my desk, and what could he say but,    Thank you for  all the help you   ve given me,    and,    Is there anything I can do for you?     Being out of a job, I said,    Well, yes, there is, as a matter of fact. I   d like  to be on your staff and help you with the transition.    So what could he  say? I had him nailed and he, bless his soul, hired me on to stay on, and  12  Finchum  that lasted as long as he could stand it. He didn   t like it, he ignored me.  A couple of instances when I offered something, he was very rude to me.  And one day, his   what was his guy   s name   came in to see me, and he  said,    Drew, I think it   s time for you to move on.    And I said,    I knew  that,    so I resigned at that point. But coincidentally, the Nixon campaign  was starting to kick off. And because of Henry   s election as the first  republican governor and our success in Oklahoma, he was very well  known in the Republican Party. And by inference, I was too because I  had been successful at raising money. I had done some consulting  around in different campaigns, and so I was known a little bit. But  because I was associated with Henry, then it went a long way.  Well, anyway, the people who were putting together the Nixon  campaign, Peter O   Donnell from Texas and some other folks were aware  of us. They got in touch with me and wanted me to go to Washington  and raise money for Nixon. And I couldn   t believe I was getting this  offer, and it was for twice as much money as I was making. I think they  were going to pay me  25,000 a year, which was just unheard of. But I  couldn   t imagine me doing this job. It was just so much over my head, I  couldn   t believe it. Anyway, Gaylord Parkinson, who was the chairman  of the Nixon committee, flew into Oklahoma City to recruit me, and he  came and spent the day with me. And I was so pleased to entertain him,  and then he left town with never actually asking me,    See ya, bye-bye,     without actually asking me to take the job. He just didn   t. I knew that   s  what he was there for, and I knew he wanted me to do it, but he didn   t  say,    Will you do it?     So, as I remember this then, a few days later I got in touch with them  and just said,    I   ll take the job,    and he said,    Okay.    It was kind of like  that. But, anyway, then I had a job with the Nixon committee, see, so I  was employed again. And I got out of town, and Janet and I and the kids  moved to Maryland, and I was the national finance director for the  Nixon campaign. I was the third or fourth person hired in that campaign.  We stayed there for a year, and I set up the direct mail program for the  campaign. Then Gaylord Parkinson   s wife got sick, and he had to resign  as chairman of the Nixon campaign, and so it was decided by the powers  that be in the campaign, they asked Henry to take his place. First I knew  about it was John Sears came to me and says,    Do you think Henry  would do this?    I said,    Well, I think he would, but I think you ought to  ask him,    and they did. Henry then became the national chairman for the  Nixon campaign, which gave him opportunity to get out and about and  get the old name out there. Then we both quit at one point and came  back and he ran for U.S. Senate and I ran that campaign.  Did you help with the transition with his office moving to DC?  13  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Yes, after the election, the Senate, yes. He and I went up at one point  and had to be assigned an office. And the way they do it, I guess they  have an extra office up there that is always available, and when the new  people come in   or when the election occurs, everybody, starting with  the men most senior in the senate, has an opportunity to change offices if  he wants. Of course, the old ones don   t want to, they want to stay where  they are so it all boils down to finally the newly elected guys get to see  what office is available. And Mark Hatfield, Senator Hatfield entertained  Henry and me and took us around and showed us the two offices that we  had to choose from, I think. And they were as far back away from the  elevators as you could probably get. But I do remember that we were  shown around in our office and in that exercise, Mark Hatfield, we were  walking down the hall and he says,    You see that door there, the door  with no marking on it? That   s Senator so-and-so. That   s where he keeps  a friend in there, and there   s a bed in there, and there   s a stove in there,  and there   s a little apartment.    And this Senator so-and-so was keeping  his lady friend in there, according to Mark Hatfield. It was kind of hard  to believe, but that   s what he said. Anyway, we got our assignment and  then moved into action after he got sworn in.  How different were the two offices that you had to pick from? Were they  very different?  I don   t remember them. I do remember they were a long way from the  elevator on the back side.  Okay, so then we   re moving up until he runs for Senate the second time?  Were you part of that campaign?  Yes. I came back   we were debating the years this morning   but I  came back and we set up headquarters on Classen Boulevard there for  the second campaign. And Bud Stewart was in the office with me at that  time. I did the fundraising and some of the organizational work and Bud  was closer to the senator with strategy and stuff like that. Was that the  first or second? That was the second campaign. The first campaign was  over on Lincoln. Yes, right.  Was there much difference between those two campaigns?  Yes, there was a difference. Again, we weren   t new the second time  around, and it wasn   t new. It was kind of more work than fun. The first  time was fun, as always. The first time, the first campaign we had, when  we were in the governor   s office, we had the opportunity to build a  pavilion or build an exhibit at the world   s fair in New York. One of the  things that the governor did with that was really ingenious. He got  working with Doc Jordan, I think. He got a bunch of college boys and  14  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  put them in kind of a green coat, a green jacket and a little uniform of  some sort and had them manage this pavilion at the New York World   s  Fair. We   d send them up there, and all we did was give away free water,  I think, and push Oklahoma. It was a PR deal. But, anyway, these guys  that had been the college boys at that pavilion, we got them back and we  used them in the campaign. Lee Paden was one, Charlie Waters was one,  there were two or three others, I can   t think of their names now, but we  used them in the campaign and ultimately, they became staff members  and members of the administration. Charlie Waters, I guess, is still the  attorney for the Welfare department. Lee Paden, of course, is in Tulsa.  But that was such a good idea. Henry worked on that. Henry got together  with Walt Helmerich and he, I guess, helped with that.  It seems like once people   s paths crossed Henry   s, they stayed with him  for a while.  I   ve got to tell you, there   s no doubt about it. He   s just somebody that is  easy to love. No question about it.  Was the second senate campaign after the Panama Canal issue? I don   t  remember where it fell in there.  Yes, Panama Canal would have been with Jimmy Carter. Yes, and that  was   we went in in    69 the first time,    73, yes. Yes, and Panama Canal,  of course, was a terrible thing in a way. I remember Henry making a  speech in the downtown Civic Center in Oklahoma City, and the crowd  picketing him over his position on the Panama Canal. And so instead of  walking through that hostile crowd to go into the Civic Center, we drove  around and I think we drove underneath and then got out underneath and  walked up. That   s the way I remember it. Henry   s comment, his opening  comment, was something to the effect that he wasn   t too worried about  the hostility of the crowd because he   d already committed suicide, or  something like that. It was very clever the way he said it. He   d already  committed political suicide with his vote on the Panama Canal, and I  think a lot of people held that against him on one end. Everybody   or  not everybody, but a lot of people recognized he did what he thought  was right, and his explanation made so much sense.  Were you surprised when he chose not to run for a third term?  Was I ever  (Laughs) I don   t know how many people knew about it. I  have a feeling that only a couple other people knew about it. But I had  not been   I had been off staff, out doing other stuff for two or three  years, but I   d stayed in touch with Henry. It was decided that he would  hire me back on the staff and this would be a tip-off to the public that he  was fixing to run for the Senate, because I would be known to be a  15  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  campaign operative. And so as far as I was concerned, he was running  for U.S. Senate. He hired me back, and that   s what we were going to do.  I held some meetings with some folks and started talking it up and  started getting things organized mentally and next thing I know, he   s  announced that he isn   t running for the Senate. (Laughs) It was a  surprise to me, and I was not aware that    But it worked out so  beautifully that way, fooled a lot of people. I can see him laughing about  that.  And so, at that point, did you come back to Oklahoma with him to help  with the second governor   s race?  Yes, after   let   s see. Where are we? I was in Oklahoma, already in  Oklahoma. Yes, I had been off staff, and I was already in Oklahoma.  Can you do some comparison between the campaign races for the first  governor and the second governor? I mean, granted, his name is known  by then, too, but anything else different?  Between first and second governor?  Yes.  Yes, definitely. The second governor situation was so much different  than the first. I had been out of it a little bit then, because I had gone  back to school and got an education. I got my PhD and I was teaching,  and so I had been away from the political thing some. And he decided to  come back and run again. He was back here doing other things. That   s  right. He was doing the Cowboy Hall, and he was in the Welfare  department. He   d taken that over and gotten that straightened up, and so  that   s what he was doing while I was at school. And then it became  apparent that he was a candidate, or a possibility to be a candidate for  governor, and he was persuaded to do that, and I don   t know how much  persuasion it took. I wasn   t part of all that. I don   t know if it was a hard  decision for him or not.  But, anyway, when he decided to do that then I got back with him and  started raising money and set up the headquarters and the campaign and  all that. We ran against David Walters, and that was, it seems to me, in  retrospect, that it was a simple, easy campaign, like it wasn   t difficult at  all. But maybe if I spend some time thinking about it, I can come up  with a different opinion. I don   t know. But, anyway, we won that thing  and I am impressed. I was impressed, and I am still impressed, at how  different it was and how the first time we went in with our small staff,  family kind of deal, and the staff just moved right into the office and  nothing changed among us.  16  McFerron  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  With the other, we had a staff of something like fifty people, many,  many of them I had not known before. I assumed I was going to be  doing the same thing, and that was a false assumption. I shouldn   t have  been there in the first place. I shouldn   t have been doing what I thought I  was doing. Joe Allbaugh was in the office, very strong character. He and  I didn   t get along. But I had the title, I think, and I think probably he felt  like he should have the title of chief of staff. I surely shouldn   t have had  the job. I was fixing to operate like we did the first time, and it was  totally inappropriate.  As it worked out, I took over the project of remodeling the governor   s  office, and that occupied most of my time. I raised the money to do it,  made a lot of decisions in doing it, and that was my focus, and that was  probably good, and that   s probably where I should have stopped. Joe  went on after, and he went into the Board of Affairs. And then, Joe, as  you may know, became one of the honchos in George Bush   s  administration in Texas, and then he became the head of the   what   Janet  Napolitano does today.  Homeland Security.  Yes, yes. (Laughs) He got himself in a little trouble there, but Joe is a  good guy. I hired Joe to be a driver for Henry in one of the senate  campaigns way back yonder. That was how Joe got established in the  first place. And then Joe went on to become an operative in the national  party, going around. But he and I didn   t get along when we were in the  same office, but we   re friends, as far as I know, now.  Well, during the times when you weren   t actually working for Henry, did  you stay in touch and how would you stay in touch?  Well, yes. How did we stay in touch? I don   t know. (Laughs)  A phone call, occasionally or   ?  Maybe.     a Christmas Card?  Perhaps, probably. I don   t know. We might have had a party together  somewhere along the way. I don   t know. Well, yes, I do, too  I invited  him to come to class on occasion. He   d come out to Central State and  teach. I remember asking him at one point. Jan took a course from him.  Yes, we   ve talked. I guess it was so casual I   ve forgotten.  17  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  Wynne  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Class must have been political science?  Oh yes, yes, for sure. I   d invite George Nigh to come talk to my class  and things like that. But my whole life in Oklahoma was centered  around Henry Bellmon, no doubt about that. And everything that  happened to me happened because of Henry Bellmon. And sure enough,  his   one of the questions, what two words would you think of? And  clearly, he   s probably the kindest man I   ve ever known, just for pure  kindness, thoughtfulness and, of course, his integrity is unquestionable,  his honesty. He   s so good to his people   and good to everybody,  actually, as far as I know. I know he   d have some people he didn   t like  from time to time, and he might say something about them, but that was  an exception.  Do you want to talk a little bit about your interactions with Shirley over  this whole period of time?  Shirley and I hardly ever interacted. Shirley, I guess, had a staff person  or two like Kathy Christie that she would relate to. But we were good  friends, and she and Janet were good friends. They would do things  together from time to time. I remember at a governors    conference, we   d  interact maybe as a couple. But her bailiwick and mine just weren   t the  same   just different. I liked her a lot.  Do you have any stories about the three daughters?  They were a pain in the neck  (Laughter) They were always in the  office. Oh, goodness gracious   Put you on the spot, here. (Laughter)  He   s talking about Ann.  No, gosh. I think the Bellmon Belles business was when we got this  close to Shirley and the family. That was so much fun. The Bellmon  Belles thing got everybody excited. All our friends, lady friends, wives  of staffers, everybody had a Bellmon Belle dress, and that was always  fun. Yes. All in all, the whole experience was quite well worth doing, I  would say.  Do you have a favorite highlight?  Well, yes, there are some incidents that I think of from time to time and  lately more than ever. Do you guys remember Becky McNeese? Becky  McNeese was the daughter of the mayor of Ponca City, I think, or  Tonkawa, one. And Becky McNeese was a young lady, a college  18  freshman, maybe, when she came to work for us as a volunteer in the  second senate campaign. Becky McNeese was born to be a feminist, and  is a feminist today, I   m sure. But during the campaign, we had hired a  poll taker from California. He was doing surveys for us, and so he  occasionally, would come in and brief us on what he had discovered  taking polls, keep us up to date so we could plan a strategy. You know  how that goes.  So, anyway, he was flying in from California, and it was a very quick  trip, and he could only be there for the luncheon period, fly in and fly  out. And so I went to work, and I got all the honchos in the campaign to  be at the headquarters at that time so we could all get the benefit of what  he had to say. There was the candidate and Bud Stewart and me and  whoever else was involved, half a dozen important people in the  campaign. The only time we could do this was at lunch, at noon, in the  headquarters so I had to send out for lunch. I said,    Hey, Becky, come  here a minute. Will you run out and get six sandwiches and some stuff  for us while we have this meeting? We   ve got to have this meeting.    She  says,    No.    I said,    What do you mean, no? We   ve got to have this  meeting, and the only time we can do it is right now. I need somebody to  go get the sandwiches. Would you do it?       No. I   m not going to get your  sandwiches.     We had a feminist, and I didn   t recognize it at the moment. (Laughs)     Becky,    I said,    If you don   t do that, then you can   t work here.    So I  fired her like that, and I know she was unhappy with it, and I certainly  was unhappy with it. I don   t even remember now how we got the  sandwiches, if I went for them or somebody else. But I told Henry about  it a little while later and he says,    Drew, I   m not sure about that.    And  he didn   t say    Aye,       Yes,    or    No,    about it, but I could tell that he was  telling me very indirectly   put her back on the staff. He never did say  that, never did say that, but I did that very afternoon. I got in touch with  her and put her back on.  Well, a few months ago, I got to thinking about this, and so I hunted her  up and got in touch with her. After that, we had made up, kind of, so we  were so-so friends. But anyway, a couple of months ago I got in touch  with her and asked her all about herself, and she sent me this picture.  She and her friend have these big tricycle motorcycles, big things, out in  the mountains, the Rocky Mountains. She showed us a picture of them  out there in the Rocky Mountains, touring the country. She   s a judge  now in Oklahoma City, I think, and she   s taking a sabbatical on her  motorcycle. (Laughs) Anyway, that   s one thing I remember.  Another thing I remember from time to time, apropos maybe. When  Henry was still state chairman and I was his gofer, we made a tour out in  19  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Hoerth  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  the eastern part of the state. We were so poor, both personally and  professionally, we didn   t have any money in the treasury to speak of.  (Laughs) We had to stay in a hotel one night, and we slept in the same  bed. I thought that was always kind of funny, but that   s one thing I  remember. Another thing I remember during that period when he was  state chairman, he had a birthday coming up, and Jan and I tried to  figure out what could we do for him for his birthday. So we decided to  take him to a Van Cliburn concert that was here in Oklahoma City, but  we were so poor we could only afford the cheap seats. (Laughs) So there  we were, way back up in the cheapest seats possible, fortunately,  because Henry went to sleep immediately, if we   d have been down front  where people could have seen us, they would have been   (Laughs) Oh,  God   Do you remember that we met Van Cliburn in New York?  No. Did we?  When we were there for the World   s Fair with Walt and Peggy  Helmerich, they took us to the Oak Room at the Plaza. Do you  remember that?  Really?  And Van Cliburn was there, and Daddy reached out to shake his hand,  which, of course, was big and chunky and firm. And Van Cliburn, of  course, had these long, skinny fingers, and everybody just kind of  cringed to see what was going to happen.  Going to crunch them? (Laughter)  Yes, that was the fear. He had just won the big concert in Russia with  Czajkowski.  Yes, yes. We weren   t at that event, but that   s good. Those are some of  the things that you get to do when you   re on staff.  Some perks?  The perks. I remember Annie having her picture taken dancing with  Hubert Humphrey.  In Ohio or something.  Is that where it was? Yes, lots of perks. Whenever Henry would go on  an overseas tour, invariably, he   d bring me back a present. He brought  20  J. Mason  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Hoerth  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  back staff presents all the time. That   s so thoughtful. What am I  forgetting?  Well, we had staff retreats in Washington at least every year.  Yes, we   d go down to, Hoover had a place, Camp Hoover, what did they  call that? Did they call it that? Anyway, the Interior Department  managed it and the staff would go out there periodically, once a year,  maybe in the fall, and have a staff retreat out there. So there were fun  things to do.  Did you have the crab dinners at the staff retreats? I remember they   d  have dinner at their house from time to time.  Do you remember the time that Walt Helmerich was at your house in  Washington, and he was sitting on the couch, fiddling with his ring, and  he dropped the ring off in the couch. And so the guys went to looking in  the couch for the ring and they couldn   t find it. And they took the couch,  lifted it up and turned it over and shook it. They couldn   t even shake it  out. This couch belonged to     Helen Lawson?  Not Helen, the other Helen. Helen     Oh, from Altus.  Yes, from out there.  Helen Abernathy?  But anyway, Walt says,    Okay, I   ll buy the couch and take it because  I   m going to take it home and tear it apart and find that ring.    And she  says,    You are not. That   s my couch  I   ve loaned it to the senator. It   s in  his house, but it   s my couch, and you   re not buying it.    She wouldn   t let  him have the couch, and so years later, I don   t know how many years  later, when she got rid of that couch, she got in touch with Walt and he  either bought it or she gave it to him. Anyway, he came and got the  couch. (Laughter)  Did he find the ring?  I don   t know. I have no idea if he ever found that ring or not. Crazy.  Do you have any questions you want to ask him?  21  Hoerth  D. Mason  Hoerth  D. Mason  Hoerth  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  I have three follow-up questions. One is, can you say more about Lloyd  Rader   s influence and how that affected the first governor   s term?  This would be opinion. Lloyd Rader was a very strong person, as you  know, and he ran that welfare department as his own professional  personal bailiwick. He had a following in Washington, and democrats in  the legislature and democrats in the party around in the Oklahoma  government held him in high esteem. It   s my opinion that Henry   s  friendship with him simply, kind of, gave him a little bit of protection  with some of these wild guys like J.D. McCarty, who might have wanted  to do something else.  There was talk, and I never did hear it, but I have read it, that there was  talk of the democrats really after Henry that first legislative period, and  that the republicans were concerned that they were going to impeach  him. Well, I don   t ever remember that, but I do remember reading that,  that that was a concern of some people. And I think that Lloyd Rader   s  relationship with Henry just gave him some sort of peripheral protection,  maybe. And that   s strictly my opinion, but I do know that whenever  Rader would come to Washington, Henry would just cross off the  calendar for the rest of the day because Rader would be there. Gave him  a lot of useful information. Rader was big in the Kerr-Mills bill, I think,  and some of the national legislation. Anyway, that   s my opinion on that.  And what were the discussions about where we would go to school?  Where you would go to school? Jack Parker was the superintendent of  public schools in Oklahoma City. He was a member of our Sunday  school class, and we were good friends with Jack. I think we introduced  him to Henry, I think. Do you remember? I think we did. Anyway, Jack  was of the opinion that you girls should not go to the school that was  closest to the mansion, and so Jack tried to help figure out the easiest  way around that problem. And I don   t know if it was his suggestion or  somebody else   s suggestion that you all go to three different schools. I  don   t know, but I do remember there was a lot of talk about it.  When the bussing bill came up, was that ever brought up?  Well, that was part of the whole picture, yes.  But that was after the fact. The bussing bill was in the summer.  Well, the bussing issue was current at that time.  But Daddy didn   t actually vote on bussing until we were in college.  22  D. Mason  J. Mason  D. Mason  J. Mason  Wynne  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  Oh, yes, right. Yes, he didn   t. His participation in that issue was simply  talking about it. It was about that time that we got Beulah Ponder on  staff, and Beulah Ponder was a black lady whose husband was just  getting out of the army or was just in the army, and nice couple. Beulah  came on our staff and Henry got her to take him around to some of the  schools, the black schools, to show him how deprived they were  compared to the white schools. And so that, I think, influenced him a lot  on his attitude about bussing and about just black support in general     support of the blacks in general.  Your daddy really wanted you to go to public schools, very strongly, and  Jack said absolutely. Annie, in particular, was the one he was most  concerned about because that school, she would be the only child of her  race. She would not have any companionship there, and he didn   t think  any child should be subjected to that. And he said,    Much as I tried to be  fair and send funds and do for these schools, they just can   t compete  with what PTAs in the northwest part of Oklahoma City do for the  schools. There   s just no way to bring them up to any kind of a par with  the rest of the schools.    He felt very strongly about you not going to the  neighborhood schools, and so there he was anxious to help try to work  something out that would meet your dad   s qualifications and still get you  in a situation which would be good for you.  That was kind of a     Was it good for you?  Oh, yes, yes.  You had good situations?  Ann and I went to Wilson. I was just there for a semester, and Pat was at  Classen the whole time, then we followed her to Classen.  Oh, so you and Annie went to the same school?  We went to the same elementary, and then by that time Classen was  seventh through twelfth grade. So we all ended up in the same place  because it was an odd configuration, really. But I think the high school  district we were in was Northeast, which was 100 percent black at that  time.  I   ve forgotten what school Jeff went to.  He was in the first integrated class at Harding in seventh grade.  23  D. Mason  J. Mason  D. Mason  Wynne  J. Mason  Wynne  Hoerth  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  Harding, yes.  And that was really tough, really difficult situation. And much as I was  for integration, I felt very lucky that we were going to Washington by  Christmastime, because he had gotten into problems there, not of his  own making. But at PTA there would only be white parents who would  come for the most part, and teachers would stand up in front of the class  and say,    Just look at this room. Just look at this. Now, this is the way  the school is.    They were so prejudiced themselves that they should not  have been assigned to an integrated school situation. And they  absolutely did not have the training or the background to deal with an  integrated situation. They didn   t like it. They didn   t want to be there.  They didn   t want to have that particular mix of kids so it was just toxic.  And so I was really glad that we didn   t really have to deal with that. It  was the coward   s way out. (Laughter)  Jeff got set upon by a bunch of black kids one day at school. That was a  bad scene. We lived in an area that was integrated, and we couldn   t sell  our house when we moved to Washington.  Because all of this was pretty new at that point, mid to late-   60s. This  was new stuff.  Well, the problem was that the schools beyond the beltway were not  required to integrate. Only those inside the beltway, and so there was  this real flight. Nobody could sell a house inside the beltway, and people  were going out to Putnam City. Is that what it is? I don   t know. Anyway,  the suburbs, Edmond was a big white community, and it was just very  unsettling for everybody, black students more than white, I   m sure.  My memory of Daddy   s explanation of his vote for bussing was actually  started in Hawaii. Do you remember this conversation? Where we were  the minority children that six or eight weeks that we were in schools in  Hawaii when we were in late grade school, because everybody was  Catholic.  And native.  And native.  Yes.  And they were afraid of us when it was 1959 and Hawaii had just  become a state, and they were afraid of what girls from Oklahoma would  do to them.  24  Hoerth  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  G. Wynne  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  It changed, because I remember the day that we planted all the trees for  Statehood Day, for one. I was asked to be the person who planted the  tree for my class, so it changed and even within six weeks. We were  called Hollies, and we definitely were put in a minority position. That  was a great experience, but it was okay. It turned out to be okay.  Yes, I remember that now.  It made an impression on him. And I remember him saying that he  didn   t think bussing was the answer, but it was the only alternative. It  was the beginning because nobody, no community was happy about  bussing.  Right, exactly.  But there was no other way to begin, I guess.  We   ve just kind of skipped over, too, the problem of the Vietnam War. I  mean, that was a big issue when we were in Washington. I don   t know if  you guys remember the big riots that were going on on campuses during  that time.  Yes, Kent State.  It was unbelievable, the stuff they were doing. Gah  Anyway     One summer when I left OSU and drove to Washington, we drove  through Ohio right after this, in May after Kent State had happened, and  it was frightening. It was still a scary situation. But he went to Vietnam,  didn   t he?  No, I was in Korea, Korean War.  No, but didn   t Daddy visit Vietnam during the war?  Oh, yes  We did. You   re right. I   m a Vietnam Veteran. (Laughter) We  went to Vietnam. We got up on the DMZ there. We did. That was a trip  when we were   oh, there   s one of the things that he did that needs to be  mentioned, and it   s not very well known. At least now, it   s been  forgotten. But it   s the    Herd Shot Round the World.    Did you run across  that at all?  No.  He decided when he   d been over there, he   d discovered that they have  Kobe beef in Japan, and Kobe beef is very expensive beef, twenty-five  25  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  dollars a pound or something like that. They feed their cows beer and  they switch them to make their meat tender, and it   s hand-raised stuff  and all kinds of stories about it. But he thought that we ought to export  American beef to Japan. And in order to demonstrate the efficacy of this  plan, he set up a demonstration.  Senator Bellmon bought calves in Florida, had them air lifted by Flying  Tigers to El Reno, Oklahoma, where they were put in quarantine, and  then they were flown to Japan where he had arranged to have a feedlot  and a slaughterhouse available and had a cowboy hired from California  to manage all of that and to receive the calves when they got over there  and to feed the calves. And to feed the calves, he also arranged to have  all the feed shipped from the United States to Japan.  So he bought the calves and shipped the calves and got the feed and  shipped the feed and hired the help, sent it all to Japan, and raised  quality beef cheaper than they could do it over there. So he proved his  point, right? (Laughs) So did he sell any beef over there? No, the  farmers over there were too well organized and there was no way. But I  suspect today that there   s some interchange. I know we   re getting  Japanese beef over here so I presume they   re getting American beef over  there. But, anyway, that was   somebody wrote the headline,    The Herd  Shot Round the World.    (Laughter) You remember that?  I don   t remember that. I   ve heard the story before, but I   d forgotten.  Yes, that was so funny. And so this is one of the perks that I got, I got to  go over there with Henry and Ki Soo Shin. Do you remember Ki Soo?  Ki Soo Shin was a Korean national, who was   you never knew for sure  who he represented or what he did, but he floated around here and  Washington and was always available to help do anything. And he never  gave us any money that I know of in a way of a campaign contribution,  but he was a friend of Carl Kettler. You remember Carl Kettler? You  know anything about him now? He is so far off to the Nazi right that you  couldn   t believe it. Oh, he   s anti   he doesn   t believe in the Holocaust,  he thinks the Jews are bad. I mean, he   s just a Nazi. It   s just  unbelievable.  Well, go back to the Korean guy. Did you go to his home for dinner?  Yes. Ki Soo Shin introduced us to a Korean guy who lived in Japan by  the name of Ma Chi. Ma Chi owned a series of night clubs called the  Caravancery. He was some sort of   the story we heard from Ki Soo was  that Ma Chi was a street ruffian at one point when McArthur came into  Japan, and McArthur   s people got a hold of him and used him to keep  communist elements down, or whatever. So Ma Chi was kind of an  26  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  enforcer type of a guy, and so that   s the story we heard. And so when we  got over there, Ma Chi had grown to be a proper sir, and he was very  rich, and he had this wonderful place that he entertained us for dinner,  and he owned these nightclubs. When we went from one place to  another, we went in a convoy of limousines, and we   d go down to the  lanes into incoming traffic and just expect everybody to get out of our  way. I mean, it was amazing.  And one night, when Daddy left his house for dinner, he handed Daddy  a leather box that Daddy didn   t open. He thought it had an ink pen in it,  a company pen or something. And this man said,    Give this to your  wife.    Went back to the hotel, threw it in his suitcase, flew home, didn   t  claim it because he didn   t even know what was in the box. And he got  home and handed my mother the box, and it was a string of Mickimoto  pearls. And I have those pearls. (Laughter) That   s why I wanted to know  who it was because I remembered part of the story, but I didn   t  remember all of it.  Yes, well, the box they handed me was a lacquered chest with two, four,  five drawers in it, and you   ve seen them around. They   re very pretty.  They   re oriental-style lacquered chests. And then on the inside door was  a little plaque that said,    Presented to Drew Mason from the Speaker of  the Assembly of Korea, so and so and so and so.    which was, I thought,  kind of neat, but my son has it now.  It didn   t quite fit in with our earlier years of home decor. (Laughter)  Well, so what was the conversation around the vote on the ERA?  I don   t remember. Equal Rights Amendment? I don   t remember ever  dealing with it.  Because that was kind of his third controversial vote, Panama, bussing,  and the ERA.  I was never really involved in legislation anywhere along the way. So  when I   m asked about things of that nature, I just really don   t have any  information. I always wished I could have been oriented toward the  legislative aspect of it. But ERA, I don   t remember.  I would say that you had quite a bit of controversy with teachers during  your administration, even though Henry was trying to bring up teacher  pay on all what was going on during that first administration. Teachers  were really on their air about something. You don   t remember that being  a problem?  27  D. Mason  J. Mason  Wynne  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  I don   t.  Do you?  I just know for a long time there was a Jim Lang cartoon in the hallway  about Daddy and teachers, but I don   t remember what it was.  You   ll have to go back. It might be in the book.  I heard a story yesterday I have never heard before. When you said  teachers, I was sitting next to a woman named Willa Jo Fowler, who has  taught for forty-two years, and she   s been prominent in   she   s on the  school board and prominent in the state school board. And she said,    I  never wanted to tell this story when your father was alive, but I want to  tell it to you today.    And she said that early on in Daddy   s career, when  he was governor, he came to speak to the state teachers meeting, or the  state school board association. She couldn   t remember which one. But  the real keynote guest speaker was Art Linkletter, and she happened to  be sitting on the podium next to Art Linkletter when Daddy got up to  talk, and they introduced him, of course, as the governor, and he started  talking. Art Linkletter leaned over to her and said,    He   s your  governor?    and she said,    Yes,    and he said,    Well, does he always talk  like he doesn   t know what he   s talking about?       or mumble, or  something, referring to his non-dramatic speaking skills. And she said,     Well, he   s a very good man and we all really like him,    and she kept  trying to say good things, and he wouldn   t let it go. And when he stood  up to speak, of course, he was very animated and Hollywood, and he  was just astounded that the governor was not that great of a public  speaker, which, of course, was kind of the joke through the whole thing.  And she said,    It really isn   t how he says it, it   s what he says.    She was  not happy with Art Linkletter in the end. (Laughter)  Well, this is an opportunity to say,    Well, who is Art Linkletter?     (Laughter)  That   s a good one   Oh, goodness. No, Henry was not a dramatic teacher. He took speaking  lessons early on in the governor   s office.  Dale Carnegie, he took a Dale Carnegie course.  Yes, Dale Carnegie. But I   ll tell you what, when he did speak, you knew  he was speaking straight. That   s the problem with so much of the stuff  you hear today. It   s just   da-de-da-de-da.  28  J. Mason  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Didn   t he kind of become the education governor during the second  administration?  Yes, he did.  Twenty years ago next month when  House Bill  1017 was signed.  We went to Bulgaria one time and somebody worked in the state  department. He lived in Enid, Oklahoma, and he called us up one day  and he said to me, he said,    Do you think your governor would like to go  to Bulgaria?    and I said,    Oh, I   m sure of it,    and so he said,    Well,  check it out.    So I went in to the senator and said,    Would you like to go  to Bulgaria to represent the United States at the Plovdiv Fair?    It   s a fair  that   s been going on annually since the middle ages. And I said,    I can  get you there if you   d like to take me,    and so we negotiated and I got to  go to the Plovdiv Fair in Bulgaria.  He had another trip in mind associated with that, and he went on to do  what he had to do, and I came back through Yugoslavia. Right at that  time, Nixon was making a visit to Yugoslavia and since I was traveling  on an official passport, the people, our representatives there, had to deal  with me, and they didn   t want to deal with me. I was a nobody, but I had  this official passport. So what they did was they gave me a guide and a  driver and turned me loose on the town, and all day long I got a personal  tour of Belgrade, just staying out of their hair.  There   s a young man from Enid who works for USAID, and I got an e-mail  from him that he had been in a meeting and they said,    Well, we   ll  have to give this the Bellmon test,    or the Bellmon something or other.  He emailed back and said,    What is that?    Do you know, and it had to  do with imports of U.S. grain. I mean, this was the initial thing, I think,  making sure that they didn   t kill the market for the local farmers. Do you  know anything about that?  No.  It would have been legislation I guess.  The one thing I do remember about grain transactions was that he would  not approve of sending grain anywhere if they didn   t have the port  facilities to handle it. I remember that.  So that it didn   t spoil.  Because he discovered that   on one trip he was on he discovered this  stuff piled up and rotting, and so he came back and made that provision.  29  Wynne  D.

And I wonder if we   re talking about  the same guy on the AID.  No, this was really recent. This was like two years ago.  This was what?  This was like two years ago.  Oh, two years ago.  Yes, this is someone Elliott   s age.  Ah, oh.  When you say you have to negotiate with him about getting to go on his  trips, what kind of negotiations are we talking about? (Laughter)  Ah, it   s probably overstated, but I think I did present it that way. I said,     I can get you the trip if you   ll take me with you,    something like that.  But, anyway, what we did was we went over to the Plovdiv Fair and  other countries were represented as well. Russia was there, and we met  the Russian representative who wanted to hoist a toast along the way  somewhere and I thought,    Hot dog, I   m going to get to see Henry take a  drink finally after all these years     And he got it up there, but I don   t  think the liquor ever touched his lips. He never did down it, but he went  through the motions of this guy. What we did was we took the moon  rocks over with us as a show-and-tell at that time.  Did you travel first class or coach?  Never traveled first class, I don   t think. Not that I remember.  By choice, or necessity?  You got me, there. You got me. I don   t know. I don   t know how we  traveled.  Were you still in the senate office the day Nixon resigned?  Yes.  Do you remember that day?  Nothing special about it other than what I   ve seen over and over again. I  know Henry went over with Goldwater and a few guys to chat with him  30  J. Mason  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  Wynne  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  D. Mason  J. Mason  D. Mason  J. Mason  before it happened. I guess they suggested he step down. I can   t  remember. There   s so much I don   t remember. It   s too bad. It   s too bad  a person ever has to go through this life, an interesting life, if he can   t  remember it. (Laughter) Why spend all the money traveling when you  can   t remember where you   ve been? (Laughter)  You enjoy the moment.  You do enjoy the moment for sure.  Now, Judy Jordan was talking the other day about the California  Governor   s Conference and how much it was. It was the last one. Do  you remember it?  Who was talking?  We didn   t go on that.  You didn   t go on that? Judy Jordan?  No, we never went to California.  I think the Robinsons and     The Jordans, it must have been.     went together because we heard a lot of talk about it, but    (Laughter)  You weren   t there.  We   ve been to several of them.  The one we   ve been talking a lot about lately   oh, what kind of  conference was it that we went to where we were at the Texas State  Fair?  I think that was a governor   s conference. Oh, no, it would have been the  senate.  We were with Millie and John Conley.  Yes, he was host.  So gracious, and we   all the staff, all these people were in this huge  room at the state fair, I guess, having lunch and     31  D. Mason  J. Mason  D. Mason  J. Mason  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Meredith Willson, yes.     Meredith Willson was going around from table to table. And we can   t  remember why Meredith Willson was there, but he was figuring big at  that time. So whether it was The Music Man was just in its prime or  what the reason was, was going table to table. And I taught in northern  Iowa in the town just next to Mason City, so when he came by, I said,    I  taught in Floyd County,    and he said,    Floyd County, Cerro Gordo      and he picked me up and gave me a kiss. (Laughter) We just went to  Mason City last week and went through this real long thing that they  built in Mason City. It   s supposed to be the main street of River City. So  we went through this little exercise of remembering Meredith Willson   s  kiss. (Laughter)  Another perk.  Yes.  Another perk. You   ve rung me out, I think.  Anything else we want to ask? Any last comments?  Any last comments.  Anything else most people don   t know, anything else not commonly  known.  I can   t think there   s a thing about Henry Bellmon that people don   t  know. (Laughter) People don   t know. His last campaign for governor  and his last   it almost seems like an accident. I don   t think he ever  intended to be governor again, of course. It just kind of worked out.  And he could have run a second time, too, right, at that point?  Yes, yes. But you know, he was blistered for his Panama Canal vote. He  was blistered for his stand on bussing, and he weathered those things,  and people still admire him. For the most part, I think the people who  admire him the least, it seems me, are republicans. I can recall when  George Bush, Sr. was here and Henry was out of office, and we were out  at the Cowboy Hall of Fame. And all the republican big wigs were with  the president on the platform except for Henry Bellmon, who was not  invited and wouldn   t have been allowed up there if he had been invited  by somebody. He was held in such low esteem by the republican  honchos that I have never felt good about them since. I just resented that  so much.  32  Hoerth  D. Mason  Wynne  Hoerth  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  J. Mason  Hoerth  J. Mason  D. Mason  He was governor during that because that night   he writes about it in  the book. It   s the end of the book. He left there feeling put off, that he   d  been     That   s when he was governor?  Yes, Bill Price, it was a campaign rally for Bill Price who was running  for governor.  And he came back to the mansion, and Will  grandson  and I were there.  And he and Will had a pillow fight, and he said,    All that was  superficial. This is the real deal.     And all that was after 1017. The republicans didn   t pass 1017.  Yes, yes.  Well, here   s the difference, I think. When we were growing up and when  you all were   when all this was happening, the republicans    big day  every year was the Lincoln Day dinner, or Lincoln Day Reception.  When   s the last time you heard of a Republican Party hosting a Lincoln  Day anything? It   s all Reagan.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  And I think that   s a big difference.  I   m so put off with stuff anymore, it   s just     And I guess Reagan   s daughter wrote an article in Time Magazine the  last week or so after the republican thing that was held at Reagan   s     The debate?  Yes. And said that she was terribly embarrassed from time to time over  some of the things they said that one would think were things that  Reagan might have believed or approved of, and she said he would not.  The thing that she was particularly embarrassed over was when they  clapped when it was said that the governor of Texas executed 200  people during his    And they clapped, she said,    That would have hurt  my father so much because every execution was terribly painful for  him.     I   ve wondered, talking other politics, and I   ve wondered if Henry would  have voted for Obama. (Laughter)  33  Hoerth  J. Mason  Hoerth  D. Mason  J. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  I sat here with him during the debates with the Obama people   I mean,  with the   during the    Ann and I and Dad, and I had the Obama sticker  for my car at the time, still do. (Laughter) And we all kept total silence.  It was excruciating to watch those debates, because we all just respected  each other enough to just keep our mouths shut  (Laughter) But I   ll tell  you a funny story. When it came time to vote the last time, he said,     Will you take me to vote tomorrow?    And I said,    Well, George is  going to take you to vote,    because we vote in Billings on the school  stage in the auditorium, and you have to go in and sign your sheet and  they always say,    Well, here   s the republican sheet,    and so I knew all  this was going to happen. I said,    Dad, George is going to take you,    we  already arranged for George, his brother, to take him. And he said,     Well, I   ll just drive then.    I said,    You can   t drive.    He said,    I   ll take  the back roads.    I said,    I   ll take you.     So I   m driving the next day to town, I   m going,    Oh, the time has come.  I   m finally going to have to tell Dad I   m registered as a democrat.     (Laughter) And we get to town, we turn the corner onto the street, and  he said,    Will you do me a favor?    I said,    Sure.    He said,    Will you go  to the bank and post office while I   m voting?    He always went himself  to the bank and the post office. I said,    Oh, sure     (Laughter) So I  dropped him off at the school, went to the bank and post office, came  out, and he was coming out of the school, got in the car, went in and  voted and he said,    Well, here   s the republican sheet.    I said,    I   m not a  republican,    and they said,    Oh, my gosh     And I said,    If you ever  break that old man   s heart, you   ll be on my bad list.    (Laughter) But I  think he knew.  And everybody said what?  I said,    If you ever tell him and break that old man   s heart, you   ll be on  my bad list.    But I think he knew, and that   s why he had me go run  those errands that he would have always done himself.  I   ll be darned.  That   s interesting. (Laughs)  My last political conversation with him was we were sitting at my house  at lunch and CNN was on, and they were interviewing Sarah Palin when  her book came out. I said,    Daddy, you need to know that if that woman  is the republican nominee in 2012, I am done with the Republican  Party,    and he said,    I   ll be right behind you.    (Laughter)  Oh, goodness   34  Wynne  Hoerth  Wynne  Hoerth  D. Mason  Hoerth  D. Mason  Hoerth  Wynne  D. Mason  Finchum  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Wynne  D. Mason  Finchum  It wasn   t very long after that that he was done.  I think he was loyal, but it was a struggle.  The party had left him. The party has left its roots and yes.  I know he gave to both. He gave money to both republican and democrat  candidates for governor last time.  Last time.  So he couldn   t give up his loyalty, but he     Who ran against the governor last time?  Jari Askins was lieutenant governor and she ran for governor, then Mary  Fallin also ran.  So we had two women.  Oh, boy. I don   t miss this business at all. (Laughter) I got to teach it, and  that was fun. I enjoyed that for sure.  Except the perks?  Yes, the perks. I enjoyed the perks. You got perks, too, in the teaching, I  guess. One of the things I do in my evening classes, my more mature  students, the first night I tell them where I came from. I let them know I  was a republican. And then I   d ask them to identify themselves, and so  I   d have all the democrats sit on one side of the room and all the  republicans sit on the other side of the room. I almost guarantee a  discussion if anybody over here raised an issue, you knew somebody  over here was going to debate it with them. I got more stuff going out of  that class and it was so much fun. I really did enjoy teaching political  science. I sure did.  So did you agree with Daddy that it   s really an art, not a science?  Yes, probably. (Laughs) Yes, yes.  That was his contention.  Political arts. Well, what could you possibly want to know? (Laughter)  Not much more. That   s a wrap if you   re ready to wrap it. We appreciate  your time and stories.  35  D. Mason  I   m so glad we could do it here and talk to you guys.  -------  -------
