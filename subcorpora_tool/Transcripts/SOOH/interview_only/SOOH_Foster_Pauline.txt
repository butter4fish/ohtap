 Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is September 4th, 2009. We   re at the Muskogee Public  Library in Muskogee, Oklahoma interviewing Pauline Foster. This  interview is being conducted as part of the    Muskogee African  American Heritage Oral History Project    which is a sub series of  Spotlighting Oklahoma. Thank you for joining us today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell us where you were born and a little bit  about your home town.  Okay. My name is Pauline Foster. I was born in Taft, Oklahoma. My  parents were both deaf mutes. They attended school at Oklahoma School  for the Deaf, Blind and Orphans and at that time, they did not educate a  child as young children, they went as young adults. That   s where my  parents met and married. I am the oldest of seven children. They did  move to Muskogee and I attended Douglas Elementary School.  How did they come to be in Oklahoma, your parents?  I don   t know the history of it, but I suppose they came here for an  education as far as I know. Then my father started working here, then we  established residency and it went on from there.  And stayed here ever since?  Yes.  What was your father   s source of income?  Because of his handicap, he really had menial jobs but it supported us.  5  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  He was the type of person that he really did not let us know how much  he was making. We survived. My mother was a housekeeper. She stayed  in the home. Because of our background, we knew we needed to work to  survive and so that was instilled in us. If you wanted to have anything,  you worked.  Of the seven children, did any go to college?  I went right to work because I was a single parent. You know, if I could  do things differently, my goodness I would. But I just started working  and my brother next to me went into the Marine Corps. He started out,  he went to Langston University and he did go to   we call it Okmulgee  Tech. Things didn   t work out, so he did enter the military and now after  so many years, he will be retiring from the Veteran   s Administration in  Muskogee. He started in Kansas City, Missouri. He retired and came  back to Muskogee and decided he wanted to go back to work. So he will  be retiring next year, so he says. And I do have  another  brother, his  name is Ronnie Foster,  and he lives in Goochland, Virginia . He and  Lansing Lee were classmates and he graduated from OSU with a degree  in chemistry. I am so proud of him. And I have one sister, Joyce Welch,  I don   t know about her college education, but she did start in pre-op, the  department where they do surgery. She married and moved to Wichita.  She   s still working in surgery, handing the surgeon   s their tools.  I think we did pretty well coming from humble beginnings. And I have  one brother, Darrell Foster, who works in Tulsa, Oklahoma in finance. I  think he   s a loan officer. Of course, I didn   t bring all that information  with me, but I think he   s doing well. And my baby sister, Patricia  Biglow, works at one of the hospitals in Wichita, Kansas, as well. And I  just thank God that he guided us. We knew we had to work and so that   s  the main thing.  Of the seven of you, two or three have remained in Muskogee?  I   m the only one   well my brother came back to Muskogee. It   s two of  us in Muskogee, one of us in Tulsa, Oklahoma, two are in Wichita,  Kansas and I don   t think I   m leaving anybody out. Anyway, it was bred  in us that if we were to succeed, we had to work.  And did you choose the library for any particular reason?  Well, I told you that I went to work because I was a single parent. So I  had menial jobs, I won   t go into that, but it was a living. And then I got  on the CETA program in 1979 and they introduced me to the library.  They hired me in 1980. I was working part-time and then when the  library hired me in 1980, the Muskogee Daily Phoenix needed someone  6  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  to help with their record keeping. They hired me and so I retired in 2002  from the local newspaper office. The library hired me full time and so I  retired in 2006  from the Muskogee Public Library . So really I had on-the-  job training and I loved it. I got along with everybody no matter  what race they were. Because, you know, when you have to work, you  pay attention and you learn as you go.  Hands-on is the best way a lot of times.  Yes. And I know I ran them crazy at the library with my questions, but it  was something I needed to know. I had to ask questions or else go home.  So you went to Douglas Elementary?  Yes, I did.  And then from Douglas to     I went to Sadler  Junior High  and then Manual Training  High School .  What year did you graduate from Manual?     57.  Can you talk a little bit about what your neighborhood was like when  you were growing up?  Everybody was close and now that I am up in years, I appreciate the  little old ladies that we thought were meddling. Really they were looking  out for our safety. You know, we thought that they were doing things  that they should not do. But what they would do is, since my parents  were deaf mutes, they were really looking out for us. We had two little  ladies that we thought,    Oh they get on my nerves because they   re  meddling.    But they would be after the girls if they were wearing skirts  too short, you know, things like that. They were really our friends and  we didn   t appreciate it. So there needs to be more of that going on now  because now the parents don   t want you telling them anything. They get  angry and so now in the churches, we   ll tell the little girls do this and  don   t do that and the men notice what the boys are doing. That   s the way  it was back then, but we didn   t appreciate it.  So how far from that house where you grew up to where you are now?  How much of a difference in distance is it?  When I grew up, I was right down the street. It was 605 South Seventh  and we moved on North Seventeenth   I   m getting teary eyed. We  7  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  moved there when the second oldest child died in an accident. So I took  her children in and we needed a bigger house. So that   s why we moved  to a different neighborhood. And so, by now, they   re all grown and  they   re doing well.  Do you know your neighbors where you are now as well as you did  then?  No. I   ve gotten to know a neighbor on one side where if I need things  done, the husband in the family will help if my brother is not around to  help me. So, if I had a problem, I would go to them and they would help  me. It   s a Caucasian family and I would not hesitate to go ask them for  help. The rest of the neighbors, they   re coming and going, moving and  new people are in, so I don   t know everybody.  So it   s an integrated neighborhood now and back then it wasn   t?  No, back then it wasn   t.  Do you have any favorite memories of Manual?  It   s the teachers. You know, they would get onto us and they wanted us  to be the best that we could be. Like I said, I did not go into higher  education, but the things that I learned, I was real quiet in high school,  but now I don   t mind speaking up and speaking out and I did learn that  from public speaking. You paid attention to what they taught you.  Did they know your parents?  Yes, they did. Most of them knew my father more because he was the  one that would go to all the sports events and of course, they wouldn   t  be at PTA meetings because they could not speak. But if there was a  problem, as I grew older, I just kind of stepped in and I would try to  handle problems that my sisters and brothers had.  Did you walk to school or how would you get there?  We walked to school, but then every once in awhile there was a  neighbor that had a car. His daughter had asthma and sometimes we  would ride, but most of the time we walked.  About how far would that be?  From South Seventh to Altamont. I haven   t added it up, but that was  quite a     8  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  About how long would it take you is maybe a better question.  Thirty minutes. If we knew we had to get there we would step it up and  not stop and talk.  What kinds of things did you do for fun?  Football, basketball games and they would have little social activities  that we would go to. It was mostly a community thing.  What was the town itself like during that time? Were there African  American business areas and stores that you frequented?  The stores that we could afford to shop in were all down on South  Second Street. Some were African American and most were Jewish  owned. We shopped when we could and most of us as teenagers had  little jobs. We would buy the cheaper clothes and I thought we looked  just as good. I thought I did. (Laughter) And my mother would make  clothes, for the girls especially. She did our hair and my father cut the  boy   s hair. When they got older, they were somewhat embarrassed  because my father had a habit of cutting and leaving a little part out and  he expected them to brush it down like he did. You know, he had nice  hair and he would put a little oil and water on it and he could slick his  hair down, but the boys were somewhat embarrassed and as they grew  older, then they would go to a barber shop. We were poor, but we  weren   t starving.  Did you mother quilt?  Yes, she quilted and I never cared about any of that and the other girls,  we never picked up on it because we didn   t want to take our time doing  those kinds of things. A good homemade quilt feels pretty good now but  we don   t have that.  Did you save any of hers?  No, we didn   t. But I guess we used them and they were worn out by that  time and so when you think back, we should have kept some of those  things. And we should have been doing more genealogy. Because we  listened to things that were passed down and we didn   t check on it. I  have said that I was going to do that, but I haven   t.  Were your grandparents from Oklahoma?  My father   s people came from Texas and I remember that my  grandfather  was born and reared in Texas and then later moved to  Taft,  9  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Oklahoma. My mother   s people were raised in Arkansas and my  grandfather finally came to Claremore. Of course they   re deceased now.  I have an obituary of my maternal grandfather. I have not done  background genealogy. It   s something everybody needs to do. But, I  must say that all my siblings are very close and we do keep in touch.  Do they come back to Muskogee often?  The last time a lot of the family was together was when we had the  Manual Mammoth Reunion and that was held last year. And when the  individual classes have reunions, they try to come back.  How often do they do the big one? If they just had one last year, when  will be the next one?  I don   t know. Maybe in five years, but you know, a lot of the people are  passing away, so.  You would have lived in Muskogee during the time when the schools  were integrating. You weren   t in school, but you would have lived here.  Yes.  Do you recall anything about that that you want to talk about?  Well, the church I go to now occupies the spot where the Douglas  Elementary School was established. We did a dedication of the  remodeling of the center where they do the nutrition program and the  church also added classrooms. When I went trying to find information     and I found information from a book that Charles Ledbetter did and the  title of it is  Alliance Against the Odds:  The Manual Training High  Story, I found out the discrepancies of the funding of the black and white  schools. I just did not realize that, but the Caucasian schools got the  funding and the black schools got unequal funding. Of course, we  wouldn   t know anything about that, but that was in the education board  meetings. That was in the book he wrote and so that   s what I noticed.  And there weren   t as many schools and when they did integrate, the  African American schools went to the Caucasian schools because they  were not going to come to our schools. And the upkeep was not as good.  I didn   t realize that much. But anyway, life goes on. And you deal with  what you have.  How many children do you have?  I have three children. Like I said, I was a single parent, that   s the reason  I started work. They   re all doing well. My youngest son is a driver with  10  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  UPS in Wichita, Kansas. My only daughter is a teacher in the Oklahoma  City school system. She teaches children with learning disabilities. And  my oldest son works at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. He works in  the maintenance department. It   s a good living. None of them has been  to jail, thank God. I   m thankful for that.  And they all chose not to live in Muskogee?  Well my oldest son went to the Army and he chose to live in Kansas  City, Missouri, I think, because that   s where his father lives, and they   re  pretty close. So I guess they went where they knew they could find good  jobs. We   re close enough where I can pick up the phone and find them  or they can find me.  Did your mother teach you any special recipes? Were you allowed in the  kitchen?  I was allowed in the kitchen, but because she was such a good cook, I  didn   t have to go in. But when my sister passed away, she was in a car  accident in Oklahoma City and like I said, that   s the reason I got her five  children and so I had to get in the kitchen then. And then I stopped work  for awhile and that   s when they all got established in school and when I  got on the CETA program. Of course, then I had to get in the kitchen.  You know how but when you don   t have to, you don   t.  So with basically eight children, if they were all under the roof at one  time, there must have been some pretty good times.  Yes. It was hectic and when the last child walked out   the last of my  sister   s children, I wasn   t mad. You know, I thought,    This is my time.     But, like I said, they are all close and they call and we keep tabs on each  other.  Of those five, do any of them live in Muskogee?  No. Four live in Texas and one lives in Arlington, Virginia.  Quite a ways away.  Yeah, but when we can, we get together. Everybody is just close.  When you were in high school, were you in the band or speech club or  anything?  The most I can remember is working with the school newspaper. I liked  that. I wasn   t in the band. I always wanted to be a majorette, but I knew  11  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  she wanted the girls with a little curve. (Laughter) But mostly, I just  studied and that   s it. Like I said, I enjoyed working with the school  newspaper.  Did you have to learn sign language to communicate with your parents  or did you have your own system?  Yes, well you know, you just pick things up. Now I knew enough to  know what they wanted, but when they had a group to come around I  wasn   t as comfortable. When my mother wanted something, she got her  message across. So you learn the basics, but I wasn   t as fluent as I see  some children of deaf parents. But we all learned enough to know what  they were saying and if we wanted something we could let them know  what we wanted. My mother was better at reading and writing than my  father was.  Had they finished high school themselves?  You know, I don   t know how far D.B.   O. went. There was a school in  Taft. But I think they focused mostly on teaching them living skills  rather than book skills, I   m sorry to say.  Another sign of the times?  Yes and I do remember that my father didn   t bring home a big paycheck,  but it took care of us. One year the Department of Labor came to  Muskogee and the job he was on learned that he was underpaid and so  they went back and made the company pay up, but then he was fired. He  went on and found another job because he knew he had a family. That  kind of thing may be happening today, I don   t know, but like I said, my  father did not show us his check. And me being the oldest, had I known,  I don   t know what I would have done. But it just so happened, things  come to light eventually and so that happened and I remember Mother  would go and we would be getting all this meat and things we needed.  You know, she tried to decorate the living room once a year and so she  went overboard this time buying new things. It just kind of hurt when we  found out what was going on. Again, life goes on.  Is that house still standing, where you were raised?  Yes, I pass by it every week when I go to Bible study and every Sunday  morning when I go to church. I haven   t been in it, but they have  redecorated and I noticed they have grass. They didn   t have grass when  we were there because there was so many   and the neighborhood kids  came out to play. I don   t know whether they planted it or it just grew up.  One of these days I might just go and ask them to let me walk through.  12  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  But yes, it is standing.  So a little bit more about your parents, were they born deaf or had they  had an accident or illness that caused them to be deaf?  The word is that my mother had some kind of fever     Like rheumatic fever?  I believe. And they said that my father had an accident on the farm. He  had fallen off a horse and I don   t know how true this is. This was just  passed down.  So at some point they could have heard a little bit.  It may or may not be true. But then they had a lot of friends that were  deaf and so something didn   t happen to everybody. It just may have  been something that happened.  When you were in elementary school and high school did you visit the  Wheatley Library? Do you have any memories of that?  I don   t remember. If I did, it was not very often because I relied on the  books that I got at school. I guess I paid attention because I went back  and looked through the transcripts and I was an A student, especially  when I was at Manual. In grade school I might have gotten a B every  once in awhile but I guess I caught on pretty well.  And you caught onto the library world pretty well too if you stuck with it  long enough to retire from it.  Yeah, yeah. And I enjoyed working with everybody and if I had a  question about something, especially when it came to technology, they  were so gracious. I might have run them crazy, but they helped me.  When you don   t know something, you   re supposed to ask questions and  they helped me. When you don   t know, you try a little harder. You  know, you practice when you can to catch up and make yourself better.  Has church played a major role in most of your life?  There was a time when I wasn   t as active. I went back to the church in  1989 and you know you   re supposed to be there. My best friends are  church members and if I have a problem or if I   m down I can call  somebody. When you   re active and you   re studying and trying to do  something, you feel better.  13  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Did you go much as a child?  Yes.  How would they    hear    the sermon?  They really didn   t go. The children went and so later they started going  to churches that had ministry for the deaf, but our aunts and uncle were  in the church so we went.  What do you see as the biggest change in Muskogee from the time you  were in, say, high school until now?  I think that everybody is respectful to each other no matter the heritage.  You know, because when I was working, in 2002 I started working in  the reference desk and we met people from all walks of life and  everybody is nice. The only time you might have had a problem was if  somebody was angry about something and it wasn   t because of the color  of my skin, it was just because they were dissatisfied with something. I  can sit and talk to anybody and I might not have as much money as they  have, I may not be as educated as they are, but everybody is cordial.  That   s the good thing. And if I have the money, I can go buy a house  anywhere   which I don   t. I can go in the store and buy anything that I  want. I can go in a theater and sit down and it doesn   t offend anybody  and if I chose to stay with someone that   s African American, it   s okay.  And if I have friends of another race, I can still go and be with them. It   s  my choice. That   s the biggest thing.  And it wasn   t like that growing up?  Well, I didn   t have the money to be going places so it wasn   t that big of  a problem. But as you grow older, if someone tells you you cannot go in  here or you cannot sit here because of the color of your skin, that would  have been a problem. I would probably raise the roof if someone said  that now because I   m more vocal, but we   re not living in those times  now. But we live in the greatest country in the world. And everybody  has those freedoms. But they didn   t there for awhile.  A lot of them were harder?  Yes. Yes. You know people died so that they could go in a place and  that shouldn   t have happened, but that   s the way it was. But when you  think of the people in other countries, there   s people scrambling to get to  the United States, and who could blame them? Anyway, we   re just  blessed.  14  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Are you planning on staying in Muskogee?  I think so, but family members have made some remarks because I   m  getting older and my brother may move after he   s retired. You know,  he   s thinking about retiring from the V.A. and the subject has come up,  but right now as long as I can think (laughter), I enjoy being here. But  there may come a time somebody might have to come and stick me  somewhere else. You never can tell, but I   ll fight. (Laughter) So right  now I   m enjoying my life. And the biggest thing is family and of course,  the church. So I think I   m covered if I have problems.  Life   s been fairly good?  Oh yeah. Of course, I made some mistakes in my youth, and of course,  you can   t go back and change them, but again life goes on.  Did you have a favorite spot in town? Even now, do you like a park or a  favorite   I guess many of the restaurants from that day probably aren   t  around.  Well, the best place I loved back in the day was Mack   s Hamburger  because they were good and they were cheap. When I used to work  downtown at a place called Grant Smith Furniture, they were on the  corner. That part is gone now because the mall took it up, but I used to  run over and get a 15 cent hamburger. It was delicious.  What do you think was the special     Well, the taste and the cost. (Laughs)  Other people have mentioned Mack   s Hamburger.  I loved it  And see, it was filling. The guy that owned it, his last named  was Mack and like I said, it was delicious. And cheap.  Was it like a soda fountain or was it more a restaurant?  I guess you would call it   it was Mack   s Bar and Grill. They sold beer,  but then you know, we didn   t go in and sit down. We just got our little  hamburger and left. So on the weekends, all the people from the country  came in to pay bills and shop and so the place was always full. It wasn   t  rowdy. I used to eat at People   s Caf  . That was facing Second  Street   and the food was good and cheap. Affordable. Then you had Bright Spot  if you wanted to go and listen to music or whatever. And then we had  the Grand Theater, that   s where the African Americans went for the  show.  15  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  And it   s no longer?  No, no, no. So now if I want to see a movie I can go to any of them. The  mall is so close, so that   s where I go now if I want to go to see a movie.  When did the Grand Theater stop? Any idea?  You know, I just don   t remember.  After high school, at least?  Yes.  Before you started working here at the library maybe?  Oh yeah, it was a way long time ago.  So maybe in the    70s.  And it may have been sooner than that because of integration. I just  don   t remember.  Are there any lessons that your parents taught you that you still adhere  to?  Like I said, we just learned that we had to work if we wanted anything.  That   s the main thing. And try to be fair. Treat everybody like you want  people to treat you. I think we had some good parents. My mother was  the one that made us obey the rules and, of course, she embarrassed us  because if somebody bothered us, she would go after them. (Laughter)  And I won   t forget that, but that   s the way she was. She loved us. Of  course, we miss them. We had a good life. We didn   t have everything  we wanted, but we made it.  A roof over your head.  That   s right. That   s right.  Anything you want to say about how the holidays were at home?  The holidays were special. You know, it was always turkey, dressing,  cakes, pies. I don   t know where they came up with the money since  things were so tight, but when my parents passed away   my mother, she  died in 1970. Then everybody still came back home, if they were close  enough, and we had Christmas and Thanksgiving at my house on North  17th where we are now. It was just a tradition and now it   s on a smaller  16  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  Finchum  Foster  scale because everybody cannot come back, but those that can, do. Now  we may have people to bring in and be responsible for some cakes and  pies or the ham or whatever because, you know, the economy is not as it  was then. Well it wasn   t too good then, but still people may bring in  more than they did then.  Is there a dish that you always have to fix?  Well, I don   t get in the kitchen as much because my brother is an  excellent cook, and so he cooks and so I don   t mind sitting down.  (Laughter) He came back in 1989 and so he does all the cooking. If I  don   t see anything cooking, sometimes if I want something I have to get  in there myself or I have to go to Sonic. (Laughter) But he loves  cooking.  Did your father cook much?  No. The only think he cooked was his breakfast because he had to get up  early and go to work. My mother died in 1970, so he would fix breakfast  and we would be on our own. So we kind of learned our way. I have two  brothers that love cooking.  Do they do the dishes? (Laughs)  Well, it was a family chore.  Holidays are special. Well the last question is what is it about Muskogee  that has kept you here?  I stayed here because this is home and I never married. Had a knight in  shining armor come by I would have been long gone (laughs), but I  stayed because this is home. I go to visit family members, but I enjoy  Muskogee because this is where family, friends, and church are. I would  move if I had a reason to move, but I   m 71 and I don   t see that changing,  but you never know. (Laughs)  Well thank you for sharing your memories of Muskogee. I   m glad you  came in today.  Okay.  -------  -------
