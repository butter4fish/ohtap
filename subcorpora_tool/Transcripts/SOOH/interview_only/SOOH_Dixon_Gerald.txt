 Wilson  Dixon  Today is February 3, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I am in Guymon, Oklahoma, today at the office of  Gerald Dixon. I   m interviewing Gerald today as part of the Spotlighting  Oklahoma Oral History Project. Thank you for talking with me. To start  out, would you mind telling me when and where you were born?  I was born August 3, 1922, ten miles north and two miles west of  Guymon in my parents    farmhouse. The farmhouse still stands, and  that   s when I was born.  Were you their first child?  No, I had two brothers and a sister older than me and I was the middle.  There were seven children and I was in the middle.  How long had your parents lived out there?  My father came to this country in a covered wagon in 1905. He and  Mother was married in 1915.  Where did they meet? Did they meet around here?  No, my dad went up to Kansas to do some day work and met my mother  at her father   s farm.  Where in Kansas was that?  Up north of Buckland, Kansas. My mother was a schoolteacher.  Anyway, they corresponded for several years and then they married and  moved out north of Guymon to a rented farm Dad had.  5  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  You said he came in a covered wagon. Where did he come from?  From Weeping Water, Nebraska. His father drove one covered wagon  and Dad drove another one. He was seventeen years old and they came  the whole trip in those two covered wagons to file on a homestead. That  homestead is eighteen miles northwest of Guymon and it   s still in our  family, that quarter of land. It took them over thirty days to make the  trip. I don   t know how much longer, but that   s about all I know about  that trip.  Did your dad talk about that trip very often?  Yes, and I   m so ashamed. If he   d start talking about that trip, we didn   t  have time to listen to such nonsense and I could now listen for hours.  Hours and hours. I   d like to know how they crossed the stream, I   d like  to know all about it. But that   s about all we know is it took them over  thirty days in those two covered wagons. I   d like to know now what they  ate and how they spent the nights and how they found their way. There  was no roads or roadmaps in those days.  Did your grandmother make the trip, too?  No, my grandmother and the rest of the children stayed in Nebraska until  they were sure that Grandpa could be successful in getting a homestead.  After he filed on this quarter of land out eighteen miles northwest of  Guymon, they built a barn and kind of a two-room shack, and then the  rest of the family moved from Nebraska.  So were your grandparents and your father on the same allotment?  You had to be twenty-one years old to file on a quarter of land, and Dad  wasn   t old enough, so just my grandfather filed on this one quarter of  land.  And then did he start farming?  They started right in. It was all grassland, and the first thing they did was  break out about twenty acres to plant feed for the cows and the horses.  So that was excellent farmland. Out by the little town of Hough, now.  Were there many other folks out here, then?  Yes, there were people homesteading on lots, individual quarters of land.  I guess those early pioneers wanted to come West and they could get  free land by homesteading on it and had to live on it for, I believe it was  three years before they could get a deed from the president.  6  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Did Guymon exist at that point?  Yes, Guymon was a little town already when they came.  So what year did your father and mother marry? 1915?  In 1915.  Did your mother have to quit her job as a schoolteacher?  She quit her job and was a farmer   s wife.  I bet that was a big job.  It was a big    I can   t imagine what a big change that was because they  lived in a little two-room shack with no conveniences of any kind. The  outdoor plumbing and carrying water in from the windmill, that would  have been a real change, but mother took right after it and quit teaching  school. Raised a garden, had chickens     What were your parents    names?  My dad   s name was Earl Dixon and Mother   s name was Rosa Henning  Dixon.  So what all would she grow in her garden?  Just everything that she could grow in a garden. She was an excellent,  excellent garden person and she loved working outside. She was in  charge of the garden and the raising of the chickens. Dad took care of  the rest of the farming.  Did you have quite a few chickens?  They always had a yard full of chickens when I was little and I guess all  their young married life, they would    After Dad and Mother was  married, they improved and got more land to rent, and Dad started  buying land and built houses. The house I was born in, they built it, it  was finished in January of 1922 and I was born in August of 1922. As I  before mentioned, the house still stands out there. It was a big two-story  house and it   s well-kept.  Was it two stories when you were born?  Yes. Oh, yes.  7  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  How many bedrooms?  It had three upstairs and two downstairs and half a basement.  Is the basement where you would go when a tornado was coming  through?  No, we didn   t know about tornados back then. The basement was where  they kept the coal for the heating stove and that   s where Dad cured the  meat when they   d butcher hogs. They kept all the hams and everything  in the basement.  Would your mother can her gardening?  Yes. She   d can her garden. She would say,    Eat all you can, and can all  you can   t.     (Laughs) What are some of the favorite foods she would make? Your  favorite meals she would prepare?  One thing, meat was our main dish for every meal. We had meat for  every meal growing up on the farm. It would be chicken or sausage or  steak. They   d butcher their own cows, so. Mother was an excellent cook,  of course, but meat was the main dish.  And then a vegetable side dish?  Always. Two or three vegetable side dishes and usually potatoes and  gravy.  What about breakfast?  Oh, we   d usually have sausage and eggs, bacon and eggs, but gravy, I  don   t know, it seemed like we was raised on gravy. I believe we had  gravy for every meal and I still love gravy.  Did she make bread?  She made her own bread. Had what they would call in those days a  starter. They didn   t have yeast or whatever it takes now to    But she   d  bake bread probably twice a week. Have great big loaves of bread, bake  biscuits in the morning for breakfast.  What about sweets?  8  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Didn   t have a lot of sweets. She baked a lot of cakes. A lot of pies.  Did she do a lot of sewing?  Did a lot of sewing. Made clothes for the children and did patchwork. I  don   t know how she did so much, but in those days, patch overalls,  where we had holes in them instead of buying new ones. She made the  girls dresses. She, of course, had a sewing machine as long as I could  remember. She could sew by hand or with it.  What were some of your chores growing up?  When I was big enough to walk, we learned how to milk the cows and  we always milked five or six head of cows, so we   d always have milk  for the family. Then separate what we didn   t use into the cream. Sell the  cream on Saturdays. We   d bring the cream and eggs to town and sell the  cream and eggs. The separated milk, then, we   d feed to the hogs.  What   s the town you would go to on Saturdays?  Guymon. Guymon was always our    However, we were only about  twenty miles from Hooker and did a lot of doctoring at Hooker because  one of the famous older doctors in those days lived at Hooker. We  always came to Guymon and Saturday was a big day. That   s when all  the farmers would come to town.  What all would you do in town besides sell the eggs and cream?  Go to the picture show. Normally, we   d take in a picture show about  every Saturday. The kids would, or I guess that   s just what    All the  farmers were in town on Saturday so the parents did a lot of visiting and,  of course, they knew everybody and everybody knew everybody back in  those days.  What was the theater called?  We had two theaters, the American Theater, and the sign is still there for  the American. The Royal Theater was across the street. They were two  different prices. The Royal was cheaper. It usually had the little cowboy  films. The American, I remember it was a little more expensive than the  Royal.  Do you remember how much it cost?  Yes, it cost me a dime over at the Royal. Us kids, it cost us a dime, and a  quarter over at the American.  9  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  What was the first picture show you remember?  Oh, it would have been a cowboy show. Probably Tom Mix or some of  those famous ones way back then.  Would you eat in town?  Seldom did we ever eat a meal in town. There was no fast food places  like now and a few restaurants, but you know, when I was a kid, by then  the folks had quite a few kids and you didn   t take a bunch of kids in a  restaurant to eat.  So was Guymon pretty bustling?  Well, it was always kind of a growing town. It was about 2,000  population when they had the first Pioneer Day in 1933. But it was  always a progressive town. It had fellows that were civic minded that  would just do things     Did you ever think about going out to Boise City? Was there any reason  to go out there?  Not really. Of course, when I got older and in business for myself, I  went to Boise City a lot. Did real estate out there and then I farmed in  Cimarron County, which was from 1948 until 1984, I farmed in  Cimarron County. Within sixteen miles of Boise City.  How old were you when you started to school?  I was seven years old when I started to the little one room school that  was two and a half miles from our place, and of course, my mother  being a teacher, I could already read and write, so I made three grades  the first year, primer, first and second.  What was the name of your school?  Eula. E-U-L-A. All seven of us children went to that school and all of us  graduated the eighth grade there except our youngest sister when they  started consolidating the schools. She went through the fifth grade and  by then, Eula phased out just like all the little country schools.  What did it consolidate with?  Guymon, and there was a little school over by the City Service Gas Plant  called Straight School. Some of the country kids went there, but most of  10  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  them came to Guymon.  Did Hough have a school?  No. The town of Hough never had a school. From all directions of  Hough, the people that lived there, they could go to Eula or there was  another one called Bryan   s Corner, which was north of there. Another  one called Morningstar. So the little town of Hough didn   t have a school  as such.  How would you and your brothers and sisters get to school?  With a horse and a buggy. They had a barn at the school that held the  horses. Twenty-one horses, I believe it was twenty-one, and it was full.  That   s the way all the kids got to school.  How many kids went to your school?  There was fifty-one, I have the records. There was fifty-one kids in that  one-room country school the year I started.  With one teacher?  One teacher taught all eight grades, and she was the janitor of the school.  What was her name?  Her name was Hazel Alexander. She taught me the first, and then her  sister, Mable   I had several teachers during the course of the eight years  there. Her sister Mable was teaching out there when I was in the eighth  grade. They were all Alexanders. So the Alexander girls started me in  grade school and got me out of grade school.  How would one teacher keep control of a classroom of fifty-one kids?  They just knew how to do it. They   d say,    third grade, reading, and rise     and would go to the front of the stage. She told classes    We learned by  listening to others.  Did you play many games at school? Did you have recess?  Oh, absolutely. We had a fifteen minute recess in the morning and an  hour lunch hour and then a fifteen minute recess in the afternoon. So we  learned how to play marbles, mumble peg and fox and goose. (Laughs)  If we ever had any snow, when we did have snow, naturally, we   d play  in the snow.  11  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Was the schoolroom heated?  With a pot-bellied stove and a coal bucket sitting beside. That was  another thing, in the winter months, the teacher had to build a fire and  that would heat the whole room to where you could stand it. No air  conditioning at all, of course. Of course, in those days, the school started  the first Monday after Labor Day in September and ended in June.  And you   d use an outhouse?  They had what was called a two-holer outhouse. Two for the boys and  two for the girls.  Would the school have a gathering at Christmas or any time throughout  the year?  Yes, that was the big time of the year, the school would put on a  Christmas program and give everybody there a treat. The kids would  exchange names and buy a present for whose ever name that you drew.  The men that was on the school board would buy boxes of candy and  nuts and apples and oranges and divide it up in about one hundred and  fifty brown paper sacks, so everybody that attended our school program  would have a little treat to go home.  That   s nice. Well, when do you remember the dust starting to blow?  The dust storm started in 1932. In    31, we had one of the biggest wheat  crops that dad had ever had. Then the drought started and it quit raining  and in    32, we started having dust storms and in    33,    34,    35,    36, and     37 was really the Dust Bowl.    38 and then    39, it started raining again  and it quit blowing, but we had seven years of real dust storms. Of  course, I was ten years old when it started and I would have been I guess  fifteen or sixteen when it was over. So I saw the whole Dust Bowl.  What do you remember about that? What about the first time it started  blowing?  I just remember it started blowing. We got dirt on everything. We just  got used to it, I guess. A lot of people left, but my folks decided to stay  and I   m glad they stayed.  Did you keep thinking,    Oh, this will be over soon?     Well, that   s what they said, it   ll get better sometime. But we   d go for  days at a time that it   d blow seven days and nights. A lot of times, it  12  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  would slow down at night and then start the next morning. The dust  would start blowing and the whole country in our area was a Dust Bowl.  What about breathing?  We were supposed to wear dust masks or whatever they   re called. Paper  masks that everybody would wear. A lot of people got what they called  Dust Pneumonia and died. They got dust in their lungs and when we   d  go to bed at night, you   d wake up the next morning and see where we  slept because there was dust all around where our body was. Our house  was pretty nice, but there wasn   t any houses that could keep the dust out.  And when you ate did you get dust in your mouth?  Right. Of course, everybody has told this same story, but Mother would  fix the meal and we   d turn the plates upside down. We had a large table  for our family and we   d turn the plates upside down and then when  Mother brought the food in to eat, we turned the plates back up and  started eating. I imagine we ate a lot of dust.  Do you remember a lot of grasshoppers or rabbits during this time?  Well, I remember the rabbits just gathered by the thousands and  thousands. They even had rabbit drives to kill them off and send them  somewhere.  Did you ever participate in that?  Yeah, of course, I was pretty much a kid when they did that. They   d  have clubs and drive them up into a corner and would have trucks and I  guess the trucks was taking the dead rabbits to, I think maybe  somewhere in Colorado, and used for dog food or something. I don   t     What was the problem with the rabbits? Were there just so many that  people thought they should just kill some?  Whatever little crop there was, the rabbits could just devour a crop in  nothing flat. They were there by the thousands. It   s hard to imagine now  how they multiplied so fast.  Would you ever eat rabbits?  A lot of people did. I don   t know that we ever really ate them or not.  You had to be careful and get a healthy one because some of the rabbits  could carry disease, you know.  13  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  What about cattle? Do you remember the government coming in and  purchasing cattle in the area?  They did that some places. Out in our area, it wasn   t big on cattle, but  the government didn   t purchase    To my knowledge, there wasn   t any  government purchase of cattle and then destroy them. But it happened in  this county where    Not any of ours. We managed to hang on to a few  milk cows all during. We milked cows, morning and night, all during the  Dust Bowl.  All this was also in the midst of the Depression. Do you remember your  parents talking about that much? Did you know it was going on that  there was a depression?  Yes, we knew there was a depression because money was tight, but a  few dollars would go a long ways. So far as the Depression, everybody  knows about Black Day on Wall Street when all the people    That was  in 1929. That never affected us out here until late in 1931 when the  wheat prices dropped to nothing. The Great Depression in the big cities  didn   t really affect us at all.  Did your parents talk much about politics?  Oh, when it was voting time, they would discuss it. I remember when  Hoover was running against Al Smith. My folks were Republicans.  Hoover was a Republican and Al Smith was a Democrat. But Al Smith  was a Catholic and some of the people sure back in those days wouldn   t  vote for a Catholic. I remember that so well. Dad was for Al Smith even  though he was a Democrat. Al Smith was wanting to repeal    What am  I trying to say?  Prohibition?  Prohibition? Yeah. So Dad was for that. He thought they ought to be  able to    But they never really discussed politics too seriously.  So during prohibition, was there still plenty of alcohol available?  There always was. There was bootleggers everywhere. Not everywhere,  but if people wanted to buy some whiskey, they could buy it. A lot of  them made their own beer, everybody that wanted to make what they  called home brew.  Do you have any other stories about the Dust Bowl? Any other  memories that you can recall from the dirt?  14  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Of course, the worst dust storm that they ever had I believe was April  14, 1935. That   s the one that so much has been written about and books  have been written. I remember that just like it was last Friday. We could  see this big cloud coming in from the North. It was Sunday afternoon.  For us, about three o   clock our time. We stood out in the yard in front of  our house and just watched that. To me it looked like it was rolling  backwards coming in and the birds was by the thousands in front of that  storm. We just stood out in the yard in front of the house. When it hit, it  was real still for a little bit, but just got black as night in a few minutes.  Then the real wind hit and it would have blown you into    So then we  got into the house and closed all the doors and windows and turned on  the lights. Of course, there   s been articles written about that storm. In  fact, I think they   re doing a retake of it here at the college this coming  April.  Did many of your neighbors head out to California or elsewhere during  this time?  Quite a few. Quite a few left.  Do you remember seeing them go or being aware that they were  leaving?  Yes. Some of our neighbors that were good friends went to California,  some went to Colorado.  Did any of them ever come back?  I   m sure some came back, but some stayed. We stayed. We had some  neighbors close by that never left. They   d just try to keep the land from  blowing and     Well, did you realize it was finally settling down in 1937?  Well,    37 was one of our worst years.    35,    36 and    37 was absolutely  the worst years. In    39, it quit, it just seemed like it wasn   t blowing as  much and it rained once in a while. Of course, in    40 it was good and    41  was    Then we had about ten crops that hit about    It   d rain a little  every year.  Was there a big celebration when it rained in    39?  (Laughter) I don   t know that we had any celebration.  Well, what would people do for entertainment during the    30s?  15  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  They had a lot of get-togethers. We had a radio. We   d listen to the radio  and go to neighbor   s houses. Like my parents, there were several  couples that would have a bridge party for entertainment. I guess the big  entertainment was when they   d get a chance to visit or travel or take a  trip. Come to town, for us country folks. It was entertaining to come to  town.  Did people have dances?  Yeah, they had dances. The country even had barn dances in places, but  I never took any of them.  Did you see your grandparents very often?  Well, my grandfather died before we was ever born. He died in    14. But  our grandmother lived and gosh, it was just a real pleasure. She had two  bachelor sons and we   d see them real often.  Would you all get together at the holidays like Christmas or Easter and  have a big gathering? Or have any special food?  Of course, our family was together. Always had plenty of food whether  it was a holiday or not.  Did you all have a Christmas tree?  We hung our stockings at the table where we sat. We had a large table  and every one of us had a special place that we sat for every meal. On  Christmas Eve, we   d hang our stocking at our place at the table.  What would you usually find in your stocking?  Well, generally some toys or something, but nothing extravagant.  What did you do after the eighth grade?  Came to Guymon High School. We drove, by then my brother just older  than me was already in high school. We drove a car to town most of the  time, but one year, we got an apartment here in town. We   d come in on  Monday morning and then go home on Friday evening so we could do  farm work. I finished four years of high school.  Was that a lot different experience than attending your one-room  schoolhouse?  Yes, it was a lot different because we had a different room for every  16  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  class. Indoor plumbing, I enjoyed the indoor plumbing.  How many kids did you graduate with?  I believe there was fifty-one in my graduating class in 1940.  When did your family get indoor plumbing out at their farmhouse?  Well, they didn   t. When my brother came back after the war, he took  over the big house and my parents moved to town. The first thing he did  then was to put indoor plumbing into the house. He got married and then  him and his wife lived in there for many, many years.  What was that brother   s name?  Oral.  Were you involved in sports in high school?  Not really. Oral played football, but I was so little. When I graduated, I  was the littlest kid in school. I was real small. I played baseball. We had  a baseball team one year and I played baseball.  Would you all just compete with other schools out in the Panhandle or  did you also go to Texas and Kansas?  We didn   t    The baseball team, I guess we just competed with little  schools around or something, I don   t know. Of course, the high school  football team would compete pretty well all over the state.  Were you involved in any other groups? Student groups of any sort?  None whatsoever.  What was your favorite subject?  Oh, probably agriculture.  Did you have a pretty good agriculture teacher?  Yes, and I enjoyed English and our English teacher also taught us public  speaking. I think of how lucky we were. Our English teacher had us  memorize (I was good at memorizing) the twenty-third Psalm. I can  imagine in this day and time, if somebody would do that, I guess the do-gooders  would run them out of school, I guess. But we memorized the  twenty-third Psalm and we could even say a little prayer and not be  17  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  punished for it. But none of that goes on at school nowadays.  Did your family attend church?  Yes. Mother was a Lutheran and Dad wasn   t, so we   d go to the Lutheran  church some Sundays and then four miles northeast of our house was  what we called the Eula Christian Church. So we   d attend one a while  and the other a while.  Were there a lot of people of German origin at the Lutheran Church?  Yes. In fact, they would have sermons in German every so often. In fact,  it was called the German Lutheran Church.  Did your mom have German heritage?  Mother knew how to speak German because her parents were German.  Did they come here through Russia?  Well, it would have been her grandparents would have came over from  somewhere in Germany.  Did you ever learn any German?  No, we had no reason to learn it.  You just sat through the German services and     We didn   t go when they was going to have the service in German. The  minister I thought so much of, he could speak excellent German. There  was a few old people that absolutely couldn   t speak any English that had  come here, so they had services    I can   t remember. I know we never  did go whenever they   d have a service in German.  Were there many communities in the area that were primarily made up  of German descendants?  Really, I think there was quite a few right where we were. Of course,  Dad wasn   t.  What did you do after you graduated high school?  I went to the racetrack and I was a jockey for a couple of years.  How did you decide to do that?  18  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  That   s a long story in itself, but I was real small, and a fella told me I  ought to be a jockey. So, he gave me a job galloping horses and then I  went to the racetrack and I was jockey just for a couple of years. Then I  started growing and I got too heavy, so I came back to Guymon and  lived in my parents    home until I got married. Started farming.  Where was the racetrack?  Well, one year I raced in what they called bush league. It was the small  tracks. The last year, I did get to ride in what I called major tracks.  Omaha, Nebraska and Seattle, Washington and St. Louis,  Missouri .  So where did you live while you were doing that?  Well, I lived at the track.  Okay, for how long?  For as long as the meeting would go on at that particular track.  And you   d just travel from track to track?  Travel from track to track. They   re still doing that today, but they   re a  lot higher class than I was then, now.  Did your family always raise horses when you were growing up?  Dad always had work horses before the tractors took over. He had the  finest horses in the country. We always had a couple of ponies for the  kids to ride or hook up to the buggy and go to school in the buggy.  But mostly it was just a suggestion from someone that you become a  jockey? You thought,    That sounds like a good idea.     Yeah.  Well, how did you go about getting a job that way?  Well, there was horses in training here in Guymon. We had a racetrack  in Guymon at that time at the fairgrounds and he had horses in training.  They hired me to exercise them and of course, it didn   t take me long. I  rode horses all my life, so I would exercise and that   s how I got started. I  went from bareback to saddle because we never had a saddle. When I  was a kid growing up, we just rode bareback. That was just a part of my  life that was a lot of fun, but it didn   t last long and I enjoyed it.  19  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  So did you have one horse that you stuck with?  You mean at the farm or   ?  When you were a jockey.  Oh, no, you   d just go to the trainers and just ride whatever horses they  would let you ride.  So when that was over, you came back to the farm.  Right.  And you farmed    What were the crops?  Wheat and Milo.  How many acres were you farming at that point?  Different amounts. I started out partners with my brother and after about  five years, I took over lands here at Guymon and Cimarron County, so  we divided it up and I farmed several thousand acres with what I call dry  land farming. I did that until 1984.  What is dry land farming?  Dry land farming means it   s not irrigated. You just depend on getting the  rain once in a while.  And so were you living at your parents    farm house with your brother  for a little while?  I got married in 1946 and I bought a home in town, and so I had a home  of my own with my wife from then on.  How did you meet your wife?  She was working in the bank. She came from Arkansas and was living  with some of her relatives and she was working in the First National  Bank. I guess I met her because they had a sorority and her sorority had  a big dance. A couple of us fellows went to the sorority dance and we  met two girls. He married one and I married the other one.  (Laughs) How long did you date?  20  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Probably five or six months where we would see each other. And then  we had fifty-eight and a half years together before she passed away in  2004.  So did you get married in Guymon?  Got married in Clayton, New Mexico. Everybody went to New Mexico  to get married. In Guymon, when you decided to get married, you had to  go apply for a license, you had to get a blood test    It was quite an  ordeal. Most of the people in my period, a lot of the people would go to  Clayton, New Mexico. It   s a hundred and five miles. Go to the  courthouse and get a marriage license and have the justice of the peace  or get a preacher to marry you. That   s the way we did it.  Did you go on a honeymoon?  No. We got married on Saturday night and she was supposed to back to  work Monday, I believe. She came back and went to work and by then I  was farming. I kept on farming, but we had a big trip that summer. We  went to Washington state, so we kind of had a late honeymoon.  What about World War II? How did that affect this area?  Well, it affected it because it took all the young healthy boys. I went to  Oklahoma City with a busload to get in the Army. After Pearl Harbor     I had another thing, when I was a kid, I had a bone disease in my right  leg and it was operated on, and it was called osteomyelitis. They don   t  even know what it is now because it could be cured with penicillin. But  the examining doctor at the  military hospital  examined me and when  he saw that scar on my leg, he rejected me because he said that would be  reoccurring and I would be a burden to the government. So I   m not  proud of it, but I was in 4-F. I   m not proud of it, and I   m not ashamed of  it because that kept me out of the service. So I farmed all during the war.  And were you a jockey during the war some, too?  Well, I quit being a jockey in October of    41 and Pearl Harbor, then, was  in December.  Okay. So did some of your brothers go to the war?  Yes. My brother Oral served four years in the Navy and my youngest  brother Ernest was in the Coast Guard.  Did they write letters home?  21  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Oh, yeah. They   d get awful homesick.  Did they both return to Guymon and stay around here, then?  Yes. Well, my one brother did. He took over the farm and the farmhouse  when my parents moved to town. My younger brother went to OSU,  your college, and got a degree. I forgot what he was, but anyway, he  took over the Alva Cable TV in Alva, Oklahoma. So he never returned  to Guymon.  What was his name?  Ernest.  And was your wife involved with the war effort at all?  Was my wife?  Yes. Some women helped out.  No.  What   s the first tractor you remember your family getting?  Well, my dad got a 1929 model John Deere. Of course, then, I would  have been seven years old, I guess. Then when my brother John and I  started farming in, I guess in    42, we got a John Deere.  How old were you when you first learned to drive a tractor?  Oh, I was probably seven or eight years old. Of course, all of us kids     I   d go ride with dad and just to drive a tractor by myself, probably ten  years old. They   d have the field laid off and I could just drive round and  round pulling a plow.  What   s your favorite tractor?  My favorite tractor was a Minneapolis Moline.  What year did you get that?  1947.  And did you keep it quite a while?  Quite a while.  22  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Do you remember the first car your family had?  My parents always had a car. Dad had a Dodge and in    29, he bought a  Chrysler. I thought that was the biggest, blackest car I   d ever seen. Now,  when you see one in a museum, it looks pretty small.  Would all seven kids fit in the car?  Probably not because by the time the baby came along, John was already  pretty much on his own.  I hear you like to collect a few cars now. How did you get interested in  that?  I don   t necessarily like to collect them. I just saw a couple that I thought  needed buying. I bought a Federal Truck, the 1917 model, and  somebody researched it and I think they claimed there was, I don   t  know, only fourteen or fifteen of those in America.  Where is that truck now?  It   s in the museum at Boise City. Boise City has one of the finest  museums in Oklahoma, and I gave that truck to that museum.  And then you have a pretty neat car.  I have a 1922 Model-T. I   ve got it in the garage here.  And it still runs just fine?  It runs good.  It   s all original?  Yes, that   s all original as far as I know.  Well, going back to your early married life, you were farming and you  moved to Guymon. Did your wife have a job in town?  She was working at the bank.  So she kept on working there after you got married?  She did for a while and I didn   t think she needed to be working. She  needed to be a housewife. So she was active in the sorority and then in  23  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  church work     Do you all have some children?  We have two children. A girl and a boy.  When were they born?  The girl was born in    47 and the boy in 1950. They both live in Guymon  and we just love one another.  And you farmed until 1984.  Right.  And then what did you do?  Well, what I   d always done. As a sideline, I   ve always been in the real  estate business and did oil and gas leasing. So I quit the farming  completely and devoted my full time in my office.  So is your land still farmed?  Well, most of the land that I farmed when I was farming was owned by  other people. I had a lot of landlords, but the land that I owned, I rent it  out to other fit farmers.  After the Dust Bowl, did farming practices change a whole lot out here?  Well, they change a lot every year.  But did people realize that they should change a particular farming  method because of what had happened in the thirties?  Yeah, very likely.  So you focused on oil and gas leases and real estate. When did you get  the idea to write this book, Eighty Years of Memories in No Man   s  Land?  Oh, I probably had the idea a long time ago, but in 2009 or 2008,  Dr.   Pauline Hodges and I was on the board of the museum at Goodwell,  the  No Man   s Land Museum , and she kept encouraging me to write a book.  She said I could tell a story so interesting, but I had a friend, a lawyer  friend, in Springfield, Missouri, that said,    Write your memoirs about  the days you were a jockey.    Well, I wasn   t a famous jockey, but I had a  24  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  lot of interesting things, so at his request, I finally wrote a story about  my jockey days. He was so complimentary of it and it   s in my book.  Then he said,    Just write about your memoirs over       Benjamin  Franklin said everyone should write a history of his life. So, this I   ve  done.  And that was published in what year?  In  2009 , and then about 2010 and 2011, we added about sixty-five  pages. The museum sold about all of the first publication, so we just  republished it and added about sixty-five pages to it.  Wow.  The museum sells them and     The No Man   s Land Museum in Goodwell?  Yes, and they get all the money. I give them whatever they sell. It goes  into the building fund.  How long have you served on the board there?  Over thirty years. I don   t know exactly, but probably thirty or thirty-five  years. The last eight years as president. When my friend Lad Hitch was  president and when he died unexpectedly, they made me president of the  No Man   s Land Historical Society. I served on that eight years and  retired in    04. I still have a great interest in the museum and I help  support it a lot.  Have you contributed any materials to the museum? Have you donated  any antiques?  Yes, some. We donated some of Dad   s shop equipment to the museum,  my family, a lard press that they used when they butchered hogs. People  don   t even know what that is now. But it   s down here in the museum  and all of it is    And some other stuff, I don   t know.  Well, that   s neat. Did you serve on the board, ever, of the museum in  Boise City?  No.  You just enjoy that museum.  I enjoy that museum and those people are the finest bunch of people out  25  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  there. They have a lot of volunteers. So I   ve enjoyed what I   ve done for  that museum. I just gave them that truck. It   s a fine museum, since we   re  talking about museums.  Yes, it is. It   s just so far out there, a lot of people don   t make it all the  way out there.  That   s right. Yeah. But it   s no farther from Oklahoma City to Boise City  than it is from Boise City to Oklahoma City.  (Laughs) Yeah, that   s true. Well, speaking of museums, your office is  kind of a museum.  Well, I   ve never thrown anything away, and I   ve got a lot of  memorabilia here. A lot of stuff that has come my way.  It   s really incredible. Is there anything in here you want to talk about?  I could talk about everything in here. I   ve got a board up there with a lot  of postcards. Oh gosh, years ago, people would go somewhere and write  me a postcard because they knew I had a board. My wife and I took lots  of trips and I   d buy some unique postcards, so this board has all that.  Pictures of the family. And I   d like to talk about these desks. I have  three desks and a typewriter and a safe that belonged to I.L. Ennis. He  was one of my landlords and he is the one that got me into the real estate  business back in 1947. He   d already been retired, but we got along real  good and he was just a wonderful old fellow. So, three or four years  before he passed away, he said,    I don   t want this to be any part of my  estate. I want to give you these desks and that safe.    So he fixed out a  quick claim deed. These desks are over one hundred years old and this  typewriter is, I believe, a    42 model.    41 or    42. So I wouldn   t trade  them for new desks or     How old is the safe?  It   s probably a hundred years old. It was used in the courthouse before  the courthouse was built and built a fireproof part of the courthouse  where they keep all their books and all that. So I think that was used in  the courthouse and he bought it from the     Let me get it on video, here. So that was in the Guymon courthouse?  As far as I know. That   s what I   d always heard.  Okay. Well, tell me about these awards you have here. These trophies     26  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Well, I had a horse that was pretty good, and he won a lot of stake races  and a lot of trophies. He won five years in a row. He won the fifty  thousand dollar classic, and that   s just unheard of for a horse to last that  long. So each one of those    Let   s see, 1995,    96,    97,    98,    99, and they  was furnished by E.K. Gaylord who owned the  Daily Oklahoman  newspaper . (Clock makes noise) That   s my railroad clock.  (Laughs) I like it.  So, that   s just one of the pleasures of having a racehorse, especially  when you win. You lose a lot more than you win, but all of those  trophies was won by that one particular horse.  Wow. What was the horse   s name?  Highland Ice. I bought him as a two year old. He   s now on a horse  retirement farm down Stroud, Oklahoma. He was born in    93, so how  old would that make him now?    93 to     He   s nearly twenty. He   s nineteen years old. Do you ever visit him?  Yes, when I was in Oklahoma City in December, I took a little fellow  with me and we went out to this retirement  farm , seventy-five miles  from Oklahoma City. They have horses, just retired horses. So I went to  see him and fed him some carrots and patted him.  How many racehorses have you had?  Have I now?  How many have you owned?  Oh, I don   t know, several.  You were telling us yesterday about how you knew Dr. Alexander at  OSU.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Alexander, and that you donated one  horse  to OSU?  I had a real well-bred mare and she had some hip problem or something  that they said she couldn   t race anymore, but she would make a good  brood mare. At that time, the OSU horse farm was nine miles west of  Stillwater. They would take horses and I   d get a tax write-off. But  anyway, I gave them this well-bred filly and in just a few days, they sold  27  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  her for a big price to a brooder in Canada. So the finance department of  OSU wrote me a real nice letter. I was Mr. Dixon that time. Wrote me a  real nice letter and thanked me for that, well to me, it was a large  donation, and thanked me for that. But just the very next week, T. Boone  Pickens gives OSU  165 million, and that made all the headlines, and  they couldn   t even remember my name after that, so. (Laughter) But I  enjoy telling my beer drinking buddies that me and T. Boone support  OSU at Stillwater, Oklahoma.  Well, that did make a difference, though, even if his trumped you a little  bit. Your donation definitely still helped. What was that horse   s name?  Roy   s Dream Girl.  Roy   s Dream Girl.  Roy   s Dream Girl, I believe that   s right. She was a Kentucky bred, so  she had a good bloodline. That brooder in Canada called the manager of  the farm there at Stillwater, and he had told him the ones he had for sale  and how they was bred and he bought her without ever seeing her. He  said that   s just the breeding that he wanted.  That   s great. Thank you for that.  The fellow that is taking care of the farm out there now, he   s in business  for himself. He   s kind of kept track of her and said that she has raised  two stake-winning horses herself, so it goes on and on.  Wow. That   s really neat. Is she still in Canada?  No, I don   t know where she    The horses that he told me about that she  raised that won the stake race were, I think he said in Kentucky or  somewhere. These people with these computers can check anything, so  he   s kept track of her.  Well, we   ve heard your railway clock chime twice now and we have the  actual railway right across the street here. Has the railway always run  through Guymon?  Yes. Well, it started probably in 19   you know, I don   t know when the  railroad was finished through Guymon. Probably in 1895. But it   s on the  mainline now from Chicago to Los Angeles. It was the Rock Island for  years. I could sit right here and listen to the trains just only a block   away . I   m only a block from the railroad track.  I bet that   s been pretty important for Guymon, especially earlier. The  28  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  railway has probably helped keep the town going. Did you ever hear any  stories or have any experiences with hobos coming through back in the  day?  Back during the Depression, it was just kind of a hobby to see freight  trains go through and you   d see hobos hanging on going somewhere.  They didn   t know where they was going, but they was going  somewhere.  Did you ever live near enough to the railroad where people would come  to your home and ask for handouts or food or anything?  No. No, our farm was twelve miles from the railroad, so.  Well, it   s neat it still comes through this downtown area. Right by Main  Street.  Yeah. Of course, we had passenger trains for years but they cut those out  about twenty or twenty-five years ago, maybe thirty. But we had  passenger trains going from Chicago to Los Angeles twice daily. But  nothing but freight trains now. Lots of them go through.  What is it about this area that has kept you here all these years?  Well, it was a place where you could make a living, I guess. The average  person thinks that this is just flat country and the wind blows and all  that, but this is home. We   ve got a good bunch of people. I guess like the  fellow says,    Everybody   s got to be someplace.     Have you, over the years, felt very disconnected from the rest of the state  of Oklahoma?  Well, certainly. We are pretty well disconnected from the other part. But  I think they pay more attention to us now because we pay more taxes per  capita than any part of the state.  Are there any stories or any historical things we should talk about?  Well, I don   t know what. A lot of people didn   t know that this was No  Man   s Land, and of course, I wrote an article of how this got to be the  shape that it   s in. For, I believe it was right at fifteen years, it wasn   t part  of the United States or nothing. So the federal law, no state law, no  nothing. Was it 1892 when Benjamin Harrison attached it to the  Territory of Oklahoma? And then in 1907, Oklahoma became a state, so.  But I just saw the other night on one of the quiz shows on television, one  of the questions was,    In which state is there a portion of land that is  29  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  known as No Man   s Land?    That was on there and it had four different  deals up there, and of course the answer was Oklahoma.  Did they get it right?  Well, yeah, I think     When you   re going to the next big city, what is that normally? Where do  you go if you want to do more shopping or get away for a weekend or  something? What   s the next big place you go?  Probably Amarillo. Amarillo or Oklahoma City. We   re 270 miles from  Oklahoma City and that   s not much anymore, but Amarillo is probably  our biggest trade city because they   ve got a lot of medical     How has Guymon changed over the years? Has it gotten much larger or  smaller?  Of course, it   s gotten larger. I think they claim we   re about 10,000 now,  and probably sixty percent Spanish. Spanish people are the ones that  work out here at our slaughtering house. Seaboard, you know.  When did that come in?  Well, it came in after, let   s see, 1989, I believe is when Seaboard started.  They   ve continuously enlarged. Now then, they slaughter 20,000 hogs a  day and ship all over the world. Of course, that   s sure a big industry for  this part of the country.  Yes, definitely. Is there still as much farming going on?  Well, there   s a lot of farming going on, sure.  I   ve heard that some lands are converted more to ranchlands out here,  but there   s still a lot of farming?  A lot of irrigation farming, too. A lot.  Well, when history is written about you   you   ve written about other  people   what would you like for it to say?  Oh, I guess they could say I lived my fullest all my life. I   m still going  strong. I   ll be ninety in August and I still drive my car and go to Hot  Springs, go to Claremore, go to Tulsa, go to Trinidad, and I don   t know  whether history will do to say anything about me. (Laughs) Except I had  a unique office.  30  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Yes, you definitely do, and yesterday you read the excerpt from The  Worst Hard Times, what Timothy Egan had written about you.  Yeah.  Do you want to read that?  Yeah. Well, Egan spent some time with me when he was doing some  research for this book. Incidentally, he did an awful lot of research and  there   s a lot in this book that a lot of people didn   t know about the     Worst Hard Time,    but I didn   t know that I helped him that much. But  he autographed it to,    Gerald Dixon, Salt of the Earth and the Oklahoma  Panhandle. Thanks for opening up your world for me. With most  regards, Tim Egan.    I thought that was pretty nice, so this book didn   t  cost me anything.  (Laughter) That   s a good deal.  And on page 328, in his acknowledgments, he wrote about two pages  about Guymon and that he   d spent some time with me while doing so. I  heard about that before I ever got the book.  That   s neat. And what did he say about your office?  He said,    I arranged to meet a man about town in Guymon, Oklahoma,  one of the little communities in No Man   s Land that was hammered  during the Dust Bowl. Gerald Dixon was well past eighty, a vigorous  and bright eyed man with a droll sense of humor and a quick step. We  met in his cluttered office, a museum in itself       and so he dabbles  about everything. One of the fellows, before I   d ever seen the book,  there was a fellow that was born and raised here that bought the book in  California. He came to Guymon and he told me that that was in the book  and that was before Egan ever sent me one, so     That   s neat.  But there   s been lots of books written. Norma Jean Young out in Boise  City wrote a book Not a Stoplight in the County. She autographed that to  me and said,    To Gerald Dixon. God smiles on us that love Cimarron  County, and sometimes he laughs out loud.    So I   ve got kind of a library  over there, myself. A lot of those are personally autographed books that  I   ve collected from other authors. I   ve got one from Governors  Henry   Bellmon and  Dewey  Bartlett. But anyway. I   ve read them all. I forget  what I read, but     31  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Wilson  Dixon  Did you know Governor Bellmon personally?  Oh, very well. Yeah. In fact, I had a state job for fifteen   I started  appraising land for the State School Land Commission during his first  term of Governor. He was one of the best.  Did he come out here, ever?  Oh, yeah. He was one governor that knew that there was a Panhandle.  Then later got to be Senator and then came back and served a second  term as governor. He quit the Senate on his own. He had all of  Washington, I guess, he wanted. He was just one of the greats.  Do you remember any time you spent with him? Anything about that?  Oh, not beyond just general conversation.  That   s neat. Well, I want to look at your office a little bit more. But  thank you very much for visiting with me. I appreciate it.  I   m sure there   s a lot in that interview that will be boring to somebody,  but thank you for coming.  Thank you.  And when I said a while ago that me and T. Boone supported OSU, you  said,    Well thank you,    because you work for OSU, right?  Yes, and I went to school there. I was a student at OSU. I got my  bachelors and my master   s degree there. So, any contribution to our  university, I think, helps a lot of people. Not just the people that go to  OSU, but a lot of others. Being a land-grant school, we really have an  outreach mission also. So it helps a lot of people, I think.  Well, I think that   s great. One story that I enjoy telling is when Governor  Walters was governor of the state, he brought his cabinet out to do two  days of business out in Guymon, Oklahoma, and rented rooms in a motel  to transform state business from Guymon. A group of us, when they  flew out, a group of the Chamber of Commerce met them at the airport  and had hamburgers and beans. They went on their way and we went our  separate way. The next morning, at the coffee shop, one of his cabinet  members was with the highway department. Of course, several of us  were standing around and he said,    This is the first time I   ve ever been  to the Panhandle and it   s not all that bad.    Then he said,    You people  out here are so friendly.    I said,    We   re not necessarily friendly, we   re  just lonesome.    That guy told that all over the state.  32  Wilson  Three or four years later, I was at Remington Park and had a horse run.  Anyway, he saw me and had some of his buddies with him, this fellow,  and he introduced me to his friends and said,    This is the fellow I   ve told  you about from Guymon that said,    We   re not friendly, we   re  lonesome.       (Laughs) So that must have impressed him because he told  it all over the state that in the Panhandle we weren   t necessarily friendly,  we were just lonesome.  (Laughs) That   s neat.  -------  -------
