 Little Thunder  Brown  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is January 7, 2011, and I   m  interviewing artist Joan Brown. Joan, you   ve depicted a lot of women  and children, a lot of domestic scenes, and you   re also an advocate for  Indian children. Would you tell me where you were born and grew up?  Well, I was born at Yahola, Oklahoma, which unless you   re at a certain  age, you wouldn   t even know about Yahola. So, that kind of dates me.  But it was also a Creek community. I grew up in that little area and  moved to the big city of Haskell, Oklahoma, which is about 1,000  people. (Laughter) That was my beginning. When we moved into  Haskell, next door was the art teacher for the high school. She and her  daughter lived there, so we became great friends. And she would have  little art classes in the summer   children six, seven, eight, nine, ten, in  that age. I just loved it  I had a great time with her. She stimulated that  creativity. My folks said   because we lived out in the country   I would  just draw on different things, or take a nail and scratch it in the wood  to  make  pictures. But my dad, he was an architect, too, so I came into that  by way of him. He worked up at McDonell Douglas, in the drafting  department, so there was some influence there. But you just don   t  realize   young children   the things that stick with them or impact  them. I remember this profile that my dad drew of a man. I couldn   t  have been any more than four or five years old. But I was so impressed  with that. I thought,    Wow  That   s great     (Laughs) I look back now and  think,    What stimulates that creativity and that desire to get things down  on paper or canvas?    Anyway, that   s a long story. (Laughs)  Were there any other artists in your extended family?  We had an aunt that lived through the field, and she taught in a one-room  schoolhouse, grades one through sixth grade. She was somewhat  creative. When I would go over and visit with her (they didn   t have any  children stay there) she had all these materials I could use like Crayolas  5  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  and things like that.  Besides nails and pencils. (Laughter)  Because we   re talking about a time after the Depression. Of course, I  wasn   t born in that, but still, times were hard for farmers. There wasn   t a  lot of money to throw around.  Basically, you   re a Cherokee girl, living in Creek country?  Well, Cherokee and Creek. I really grew up in the Creek area, and had  more influence, I think, through that than I did with the Cherokee. But at  that point in time, I think most people wanted to be the same, culturally.  I mean, I know that there was still   because Concharty Mountain was  close to us   there were a lot of Creek people that lived out there. They  still had their grounds and things like that, and they had their camp  meetings. My dad would go up there. He put together a ball team of little  boys that were eight, nine, and ten in that area. We would go and pick  them up, and they would come into Haskell and play in different areas.  People just didn   t have money. He had to get out and get money for  shoes, uniforms, and all kinds of things, but it was a unique Native  American team. At that time, you just didn   t see that, as a rule, playing  with the regular system, through the  leagues       With  an Indian baseball team. When you say that people wanted to be  the same, culturally, are you talking about the fact that you weren   t  really encouraged to identify Indian that much?  It seemed  like  that to me. I mean, we knew Indian people, but there  wasn   t a big emphasis about that. Of course, that was the Korean War.  People getting jobs and everything. I know that Dad and several of the  men from Haskell drove back and forth together. It was just a small  community to begin with. I think that makes a difference.  The focus was on blending in and assimilating? How many brothers and  sisters did you have?  One sister and one brother. My brother has a degree in architecture from  OU. Of course, he was in the service, Air Force, and traveled all over the  world. He enjoyed art, but he just didn   t really go in that direction of  being an artist.  I read that, in some ways, you had a rough childhood. You lived with  your grandmother for a period.  Yes, yes.  6  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  How did that impact your life?  Again, it was that time and the influence on people, what they would  see, especially through the media, movies and things like that. It was a  time  when  things picked up because of the war. People had jobs and all  that. It seemed to me that the drinking and all those things increased.  And my mother, she had some emotional problems, but yes, I spent a lot  of time with my grandmother, who lived in Choska. That was another  Creek community. I was really close to her. I really was close to her. She  loved having us there. But I lost my dad   suicide, which wasn   t   or  isn   t   it   s a sad way to put it, but it just not that unusual. Drinking and  the discourse of stress and everything, and the marriage. Yes, it has an  impact, no matter what. Perhaps it made me stronger, because I had a  brother and sister to worry about, too.  You were the oldest sibling. So, did your grandma speak Creek?  That was my mother   s mother. My dad   s mother died when I was pretty  young. And at that time, too, another emphasis was, we learned some  Creek and Cherokee words and things like that, general conversation,  but not to any great extent because nobody wanted to be any different.  So, your Indian ancestry is on your dad   s side?  Yes.  You mentioned your experiences with art in school. As you went along  through the school system, did you get any reinforcement for your  talent? (Laughter)  Not particularly. I can remember my aunt and uncle, the schoolteacher.  But my uncle, it was my dad   s brother, wonderful people and very  supportive. But he wasn   t real thrilled about the art part of it. He said,     You can   t make a living on that unless you   re Charlie Russell. What are  you really going to do with your life?    (Laughs) So, there wasn   t a lot of  support for that. That was just kind of a hobby, or what they viewed as  being hobby things. In later years, my aunt   of course, my uncle passed  away   but my aunt expressed that she was really pleased and thought  that had been a real asset to my children and myself. And my children,  all my kids are real creative in some avenue. Now, they   re not as  committed to the hard work  of art . (Laughter) They have their degrees  and are teachers and things like that, and that   s not easy. But they saw  the hard work that goes behind it and the hours that you commit to, so  they decided that wasn   t what they wanted to do. (Laughter)  7  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  But they appreciate how much is involved. What was your first  experience with Indian art?  That   s all I ever did  I don   t know  (Laughter)  Were you drawing Indian subject matter when you were little?  Well, a lot of it was. That was what I was around. At least the people     just the people, that   s what I drew, but to get more in-depth, culture and  everything, that came later, again, because it wasn   t really encouraged at  that point. But, like, the baseball games, stickball, things like that, I   d  seen and knew of earlier. Gosh  Ball games, ball games, ball games     (Laughter) It   s still that way, and I think that   s a great thing for Indian  kids.  You went to Bacone  College  at one point.  Bacone College was  established in 1880 by the Muskogee Creek Tribe, and overseen by the  executive board of the American Baptist Home Mission Society. In the  mid-twentieth century, it became a well-known training ground for  Indian artists.   I did. I did. I went to Bacone in the early    70s. I had worked at different  jobs. I had lived in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and everything, but my  husband, he was Native American. An alcoholic. I don   t mean that that   s  the average. I mean that   s just the way it worked  out . I had three  children, and my children, I had taught them some beadwork. And they  made little things, hair ties, rings and bracelets and things. We would  supplement our income by going to craft shows on the weekend like Fort  Gibson, when they opened that up over there. I didn   t ever think about it  because you never do until later, but Will Sampson was there, the Tigers  were there, people that you just took for granted. Same shows and all  that. That   s actually when I really got more involved in those kinds of  shows. But it supplemented our income some, so my children grew up  more in that culture than I did. But back to Bacone. One of these shows,  Terry Saul came by, and I didn   t know who he was except that he was  an Indian man. We visited a little bit and he said,    Well, why aren   t you  in school?    I thought,    What?     (Laughter) He said,    Well, I teach art  out at Bacone College.    He said,    I wish you   d come out and see me.  You need to be in school.     So, I said alright. I was working at that time, and I had saved my money  because I knew I didn   t have any money. I had no idea there was any  avenues for me. But I   d saved enough. I called out there to take a class,  art class, and went out there. Anyway, we lined up outside to enroll. But  Terry Saul came down the walk and I spoke to him as he went by.  8  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  I thought,    He won   t remember me,    but he stopped and came back and  said,    What are you doing out here?    I said,    Well, trying to get to  school.    (Laughter) I know people have heard that story, but he did. He  said,    Well, come on with me,    and I thought,    Great  I   ll get in here  and get out. One class, alright     (Laughter) We wound up upstairs and  the president of the college  was  Charlie Hollywood, a Creek man.  Anyway, Terry Saul said,    This is Joan Brown. She has talent and she  has no money.    And I thought,    What a strange introduction     (Laughs)  I thought,    Oh, my goodness     Charlie Hollywood looked at me and  said,    You say she has talent?    He said,    Yes.    So, he wrote out this  paper and gave it to me. It was a full scholarship to go to school. I was  just in shock, really. But I left knowing I was going to do that.   Because  somebody believed in you that strongly.  Right.  When Terry first saw your work at arts and crafts shows, were you  already using women and children as subject matter, or were you doing  different things?  Some of the things, too, was the Trail of Tears show. You would enter  some things over there with that depiction.  So you had already entered that show?  Yes, I already had some things under way.  Terry Saul  was pretty good.  He saw that I had the ideas and the creativity. When I tried to go to a  particular style that I thought I was supposed to stick with, he   d say,     You have a style started. Don   t go away from that.    He said,    That   s  hard to develop. You can copy and do the same thing over and over, but  develop your own style.    So, he encouraged  me in  that direction. What  I was doing, I saw it more as   oh, I don   t know. I just didn   t see it as  being Indian art, to begin with. But he was very encouraging. Honestly, I  would never have gotten into it if it hadn   t been for him. I just don   t  think I would have. I tell young people that ask me,    Don   t miss that  experience of going in and sharing with other artists, and an instructor  that you can go to and ask and get that information.    I see a lot that just  want to jump out there. They have it, and they say,    Well, here  Here   Here     They   ll point to Jerome, because most of them come through  thinking he just jumped up one day and became an artist. (Laughs) He  had an interest, but he did go  for more instruction  and developed,  which is great. And that camaraderie of other artists is wonderful.  Influences get traded around and that creates synergy. I want to make  9  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  sure I understand. When you were showing at Trail of Tears and other  places, you were using this style more. It wasn   t a flat, two-dimensional  style.  I had kind of mixed that. I was doing both at the same  time , and hadn   t  fully moved into the other. But I was there at the first  Trail of Tears   show. Think about that.  The show  was hung on chicken wire, outdoors.  They built up quick, little things to hang artwork on. You talk about  primitive  (Laughter)  Was this in the late    60s?  This was in the    70s when they started. I   m pretty sure that was their  first show. Let   s see, who   well, I know the Tigers were there, and I  think Joe Rector, but there were some artists there. It wasn   t that big of a  show. Looking back, I think about how, gosh, that grew out of that   Who were some of your fellow students at Bacone at that time?  You know, I was a little bit older. I was twenty-six years old, I guess,  twenty-five, twenty-six. I didn   t live on campus, so I didn   t have a lot.  But Buddy and Glenda Scott were going to school then, and they were a  little bit older than I. They were Creek. They did a lot of arts and crafts  things, and I met them at shows. So, I had some folks like that, that  I   already had some contact with. But when you   re working and going to  school and taking care of family, you just don   t have a lot of time to  hang out. Benjamin Harjo   not the artist, this is another Ben Harjo that  was there at the time. He was a character. He had a lot of creativity, but  he came to the first class, and then at the end of the semester I saw him  at the last class. (Laughter)  Nothing in between. (Laughs)  That was kind of interesting. He   s on the Creek Council now. (Laughter)  But you know, you just meet a lot of people that have that character     well, they   re creative folks, that   s just the way it is.  Were you living in Haskell still?  No, I lived in Muskogee at that time.  You had already entered some shows. When did you begin other  competitive shows? Was it immediately?  Well,  the Trail of Tears  show was the first one I   d entered. We   d travel  to do the Museum. Chief kept pushing me to go up there and enter a  10  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  show. I didn   t feel like I was ready for that. And Jerome had really  picked up at that time. Gosh, after you saw his work     Was this Council Oaks or was this at Cherokee Museum?  Five Tribes Museum. But I took some work up there, and the lady said,     Oh, yes  Terry Saul   s been telling me about you.    (Laughs) So,    Well,  okay. I   ll enter.    Woody Crumbo was the judge the first time I entered,  and I had won third place in painting in the Cherokee division. I thought,     Oh, wow  That is wonderful     I   m still impressed by that. Woody  Crumbo   years later when I saw him I said,    You know, you judged a  show I was in one time at the Five Tribes?    He said,    Well, I remember  it because that   s the only one I judged for them     (Laughter) But he was  very supportive, too. There was an art show downtown in Muskogee,   and  for some reason he was there. He said,    You need to start getting  plates on these things so that you can make prints.     It can make a huge difference to have a well-known artist to judge your  work and give you an award. Did you end up having quite a bit of  interaction with Crumbo?  Over the years   he always remembered me, which, I was very honored.  He would come up and visit with me, and I felt really great about that.  That was encouraging. We   re older artists   I think that   s important for  us to encourage young artists. What I see today is there   s not that big a  group of people going into Indian art. I think back in our time, and think  about all the folks that started painting and  are  still painting, that was a  pretty large group. It was a swell, at that time, a major group of people.  Why do you think that is?  Well, again, I go back to, is it the hard work? (Laughter) I don   t know.  I   m just not sure about that. It could be more students are getting into  commercial art. That may be more enticing as far as money, but I just  don   t know.  Because there   s still a strong market for Indian art.  There is. There is.  What about some of the early galleries that you dealt with?  Well, there again, I really was slow on the uptake, getting out and  promoting myself. I just didn   t do much of that. But I was introduced to  Linda Greever  by  Ben Harjo, the artist, in Tulsa and so was included in  her show the next time she had one. So, that was good. That was my first  11  Little Thunder  Brown  experience or introduction to a gallery there. Locally, in Muskogee, this  lady, Shirleen, had a little frame shop, and I would get some things  framed for shows and take them to the different shows. Anyway, she had  approached me   she wanted to have a show, locally. Really, I hadn   t  sold that much, locally or anything, but she kept kind of pushing that.  Marie Scaggs was local, as well. She came to me about doing a project  for the mentally handicapped in Muskogee, and doing some artwork that  they could sell to build a group home for folks.  I had, at that time, gone to work for Murrow Indian Children   s Home  and worked there a couple of years. So, my heart was really into  providing good care for people. I saw the care and set the program that  was there at Murrow, so I talked to her. I said,    I   m going out to Santa  Fe for the art market out there. Let me think about it, and when I get  back, I   ll get back with you.    When I came back I said,    What if we do  five sets  of limited prints  and release one set each year? That   d give  you five years of time and everything  to raise money .    So, she was  really elated about that. That was instrumental in helping get the first   group  house started. Now there are three in Muskogee, which is pretty  good for this population. Wonderful people. It was just another great  experience for me, to be able to be a part of that building. But Murrow  became a big part of my life as well, so things would change there. I left  one time for two years and went back, but eventually, I had thirty-five  years when I retired from Murrow last April.  How did your art skills come to bear in your job? Did you do any  teaching of art classes?  I did. I wouldn   t say that they were structured classes, but we   d do  projects in the summer. It started out that way. Mary Horsechief was the  director there, when I went to work   another artist. We had met through  Al-Anon, actually. Anyway, the summer programs   that was kind of a  low time with money, but I approached her about putting together a  summer program, doing some trips and things, and going out and doing  some sketching. She said,    Well, if you can come up with the money,  fine.    (Laughter) But I did go to the county commissioners that were  here at the time, and they allotted us  1200 for the summer, which was  great, just fantastic.  That was our first official summer planned program. But the kids really  enjoyed it and we had some good times. So, that just has grown over the  years. Again, you   d have some students that liked to do that, but most of  the time the kids enjoyed  that  you didn   t have to get stuck in one  media, or be in such a structure  that  you have to do these steps first.  We just went with what kids liked to do. Give them materials, and let  them experiment. Just the experience of being out there, eating lunch,  12  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  and doing things like that. I had some pretty good artists, too, that came  through and went back to their home to their tribes.  That   s great. Any names we   d be familiar with?  Well, one in particular, I had found out that he had passed away not too  long ago, Kevin. He just had so much talent. So many of our kids that  we had at Murrow had problems within the family, so it   s quite a  struggle. Murrow had been a mission for children. Reverend Murrow  started that in the 1800s. And it was just a wonderful education for me,  the opportunity to be that close, and be a part of the giving and  everything. It still amazes me. Last summer, this man came in. He was  retired out of the Air Force, but he was  at Murrow  in the early    50s,   with  his two brothers. They were just young. He didn   t have any  pictures of his brothers. One of them had died when they were there. I  don   t know what circumstances were. When I went in and went back to  find the file   you have stacks of files and paper files. But anyway, there  was a picture of all three of them together. Some of those things, you  think,    Gosh, I   m so glad I could do that     But that was just an  experience over the years. We sat down one day and said well,  approximately 1500 kids, at least, I had contact with during that time   Experienced part of their lives with them   That   s an amazing legacy. Did you pursue your own artwork while you  were there? Were you able to?  It   s always interesting. Of course, everybody has a different take on  things, but Mary said,    You can work on your own artwork here, too.     But that was when I really saw a need for social work, a social worker.  There wasn   t a social worker, there wasn   t counseling services there. So,  I got involved in that end of it, in counseling services through the state,  local facility. When you get into that, it kind of begins to roll and take  priority. But I still kept being able to get into shows. Still had good  friends that were involved as well. We did a show called Daughters of  the Earth.  I wanted to ask you about that group. Can you explain how that came  about?  I think Virginia Stroud, and I can   t remember who else, kind of started  that idea. Doris Litrell was a part of that, out of Oklahoma City. They  put that together and collected these women that would be interested in  doing that. The overall conversations of being with that group of women  was that we all had these families we were taking care of and all these  things going on, and yet, we managed to work the art in. I always  wonder about testing men that way. (Laughter)  13  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  How much multitasking can you do? (Laughter) So, in addition to trying  to raise your collective visibility as a group of Indian women artists, was  it also kind of a support group?  Well, of course, we all knew each other, and that was good. We were all  compatible. We could get along pretty well and when you   re traveling,  that   s a good thing. It was fun, too. We didn   t know how that was going  to be received, number one, because males in the art world received  more attention, let   s put it that way, at that time. But we were so well  received in the different areas. Nebraska, Virginia, just different areas. It  was amazing the people that came out to see the work. That was really a  boost to all of us.  Are we talking the mid    70s here?  Now, I   m going to tell you something. When you   re interviewing people  over fifty, you should warn us ahead of time  (Laughter) I think that was  in the    80s. I may be wrong, but I believe that was.  Did Jane Malden and Valjean Hessing show with that group?  Jane Malden and Valjean Hessing were sisters, and of course, any time  they were together, that was always the fun part of it, I tell you.  (Laughter) Both of those ladies were so creative. Their minds were just  like that, all the time.  Snaps  Just going and playing off each other, and  we would just be sick from laughing. (Laughter) Just really great friends  and just a joy to be around. They made it very light and fun. (Laughter)  I read in one article about Daughters of the Earth that while you and  Virginia were doing your art at home, you had to be ingenious about the  way that you set up your studio space. Can you talk about that for a  minute?  Oh, my goodness  Now, you have to remember, we didn   t have a lot of  money. (Laughter) I was thinking the other day,    What was I doing with  two old air conditioners, anyway?    (Laughter) And you say,    Well, how  does that work?    Well, I had three children and then I had two   there  was a ten-year space. And I had these two younger ones that were just  months apart. It was like eleven months between those two. Anyway, in  order to   I had a big, round antique table, and did a lot of painting on  that wood table. But I   d be painting and those little kids would run up  and hit the table. (Laughter) So, I came up with this idea that I   d get  these guys to stack these two air conditioners, and I would get on top  and sit on that because they were so heavy, it didn   t matter if they hit  those.  14  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  I know that   s a picture, but that   s what I did. (Laughter) I   d have all my  sketching done. It didn   t matter to sit down at the table with that, but  when it came to the painting, when you put that paint down, it   s down.  (Laughter) I know there   s artists that have similar or maybe even worse  stories than that. Oh, my goodness, yes  The other alternative was to  wait until everybody was in bed, asleep, after midnight, and paint. So, I  did a lot of that. I remember one time going out to Santa Fe and I needed  money to get out there. I talked to Doris and I was working on a pretty  good- sized piece. She said,    Well, bring it by. I   d be interested in it.    I  wasn   t quite finished. I had the frame and everything with me. I know  you   ve been through this.  Yes, yes. (Laughs)  So, I worked until two o   clock and decided,    Well, I   m worn out. I   ll  sleep two hours until four, get up, and finish it.    So, that   s what I did.  Then she took it out to the other show. Is it Arizona that it happens right  before or after the Santa Fe? Anyway, I won an award out there  at the  Heard Museum show , which was great. I look back and think,    I  must   ve been out of my mind     (Laughter) Or,    Why aren   t I out of my  mind?    at this point.  Sometimes those are the best pieces. (Laughter) At some point you did  return and get a degree in counseling at Northeastern  State University  in Tahlequah .  I did go to Northeastern. I didn   t finish and get a degree, but I was right  at that point. It would   ve been good, but I had a lot of health problems,  lost a kidney, and things like that. So, I had a couple of years that I just  couldn   t run to school and work, too.  Was that while you were at Murrow?  Yes.  How do you think the Indian art scene changed during the    80s? Maybe  a stronger presence of women artists?  Well, I think women brought   and this is going back to the Nebraska  show   there wasn   t as much sadness as you saw in men   s work. They  may have been locked into that, because that   s what people expected.  You saw a lot of family themes. Valjean and her work, she had a lot of  just families, children, daily tasks, and humor. That   s what a lot of the  people that came in enjoyed. That take from the women, away from that  grief.  15  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  You became a Master Artist of the Five Civilized Tribes. What did that  award mean to you?  Number one, I couldn   t believe that. Back to Terry Saul, he was one of  the first group  of Master artists . I don   t know that he   s one of the first  group, but within those two   the first and the second. I wanted to go up  and see him receive his award because of him being my instructor.  Again, as I say, he was always so supportive. After the ceremonies, we  were staying out on the porch, and he came out too. They had been  given these big, round silver plaques, and Joan Hill was given one at that  same time, as I remember. I said,    Well, congratulations,    and he said,     It   s good to see you.    And I said,    Well, gosh, I had to come see this   This is great     He said,    Oh, you   ll be getting one of these one day.    I  just laughed and I said,    Sure  Yeah, right     (Laughter) But he was so  encouraging and always just very positive and supportive. Again, when  that happened, I was like,    No     (Laughs)  In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed, requiring that  Indian artists have proof of enrollment or that they be certified by their  tribe. Do you remember how that impacted galleries and individuals?  Well, I know there was a lot of discussion among the artists and  everything because it changed some lives in some ways. Things came  out. I remember one artist had assumed he was a particular tribe, and  then it came out he actually had been adopted and was another tribe. So,  there were just lots when it came on. That created some sadness, too,  because you had people that you admired, and still do. They   ve grown  up in the culture, they   ve been there in the culture. So, there   s sadness,  and it   s just a big question mark. I know during my time at Murrow,  through the American Baptist churches   and their headquarters in  Valley Forge   there   s been over three hundred tribes   this is more  recently    who have  approached them about giving them support to be  recognized by the United States government. So, you weigh that, and  you look at that. You know, that   s a fact because the East Coast was hit  so hard it almost wiped out. And if you were small, it was harder to  recognize small  groups  than larger  groups .  There are a lot of    ifs    and    whats    going on with that. I don   t know. I  just don   t know. And then I see some tribes that are relatively small, and  they   ve run out of people. If they marry a tribal member, it   s a cousin.  So, you   re getting into, you have to be, some of the tribes are saying, a  quarter or more. They   re really fighting for that, but when you look at it  realistically, they can   t keep that up and survive.  I know Murrow went through some tough times, financially, in the    90s.  16  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Was there a period it was not easy to do your artwork, when you kind of  stopped painting?  Murrow is a Ministry and Mission of American Baptist Churches. It   s  not affiliated with any particular tribe. In that way, that was always kind  of rough. But what brought on survival for Murrow, I think   because it  had been closed once for two years because of finances and different  things    was  when the tribes began to gain more money, through  casinos and things like that, they were very supportive of Murrow. The  Creeks, of course, were one of the first to step up and commit to a yearly  donation to us. And then the Cherokees and some of the other tribes  could put in more monies to help with kids from their tribes. We had  kids from all over the state of Oklahoma. That has made a big difference  for Murrow. Now, you have to look at, still, 65 percent of the income  comes through the churches. And right now is not a good time for   churches  across the county. So many people are out of work, or one  thing or another. But at least they do have the tribes that recognize, and  especially, again, the Creeks because of that history with them. They   re  very good to step in and help in emergencies.  Well, now you are working at the Art Market  in Muskogee . Besides,   having  a paycheck and being around art, are there some specific  creative benefits for an artist for working in a gallery?  Of course there is. Gosh, it   s great  Linda was having a hard time with  some help, or finding help. The gentleman that works here four days was  trying to work the seven. So, that was a stress. We were talking about it  and I said,    I think I could help a couple of days or so.    She said,    Oh      I was visiting with her and her son, Chris. We   d gone out to eat and I  said,    I think I   d like that. It   d be good,    because you get to a certain  point, you don   t just want to sit at home all the time. You   d think,    Well,  you can sit and paint all the time.    Well, that   s not it, either. (Laughter)  Anyway, that   s how that began, and I love it. I   ve been here about three  months now, but it puts you back in the mainstream, and gets you  excited again. So, I   ve been working on some things. When you get  older, you better hurry up. Those eyes might go. (Laughter) Yes, it   s  really been fun, and I get to see the artists again, things like that.  Gouache and pencil, as I understand, are your preferred media. Have  you worked much in any other media?  When I started at Bacone, of course, we worked on some acrylics and  oils. I would like, someday, to do some landscapes because I just love  that, and sunsets and things like that. I   m experimenting a little bit along  that line.  17  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  With some acrylics.  Right. Well, acrylics dry so fast. Of course, I should be used to that as a  watercolorist, but I   ve never been a big fan of acrylics. But that   s just  me. I kind of like that opaque  look , and that acrylic can dry fast.  (Laughs)  What do you like about gouache and watercolor?  Valjean, if anybody is familiar with her work, she could get that really  flat  look  with the gouache as well. Gouache has some versatility. I can  get an opaque with that, and it can be softer, and that   s part of what I  like, that softer approach. I love the flat style. Of course, Valjean had  that sewed up. (Laughs) Her corner of it.  You just have this wonderful use of line, excellent draftsmanship     I love black and white. I love black and white or dark brown and cream,  that kind of thing. Pen and ink. I tell you, I took piano for, I guess about  ten years and loved it.  As a child or later?  Well, in my childhood. I started at six, and I was taking piano for quite a  while, into my teens, but music. I think I liked to get that into the work. I  like those lines, that flow and everything. Pen and ink is a good place for  that.  So, you   re thinking about rhythm, the rhythms of the lines.  Yes, movement, it   s much like music to me.  I   ve mainly seen smaller scale works of yours, but do you work larger  sometimes?  I like to do the larger pieces, and I have done several through my life. I  just don   t have any. (Laughter)  The dominant characters in your work, I think, are either children or  traditional Creek or Cherokee women. You call them    sofke women    or     kanutche women.    I wonder if you could talk about what those women  represent.  For me, they were the strength of the family. I say that with   they still  allowed the men to have some of their thoughts about their  business .  (Laughter) I did several paintings with fishing, men and women, and  18  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Browm  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  some of the humor that would go along in the simplest things. One was  where she started to throw the pole out, and the hook hooked him in the  back. (Laughter) Just different things that kind of express that  relationship that is subtle, because usually, there   s not a lot of emotion  shown in public between an  Indian  man and woman. But it   s there, if  you watch the looks, the different things, the little experiences. The titles  I usually put on there lead into what   s going on, as well. I like to do  pieces on men, on older men. I   d like to get back into doing some of  that. But the women took over in my life and the work, because of the  attention I got from older women that really plugged into that and could  relate to it. That   s what they wanted to see when they came to the art  shows. (Laughter)  Besides being drawn in this cartoon tradition, they have these strong  features. Did you experiment with a number of different types of faces or  facial features when you came up with your women characters?  Usually, I could start with the eyes. I know that sounds kind of crazy. I  mean, I know how to lay out the circles and egg-shapes and all those  kinds of things, but I wanted to see what would appear in that face, and  build from there. The eyes are usually the place to start with. I can have  an idea, but if it works, and those eyes show that curious or that  humorous or just that character in  them , it goes from there, easy.  I   ve heard you compared to Norman Rockwell. I don   t know if you   ve  heard that comparison     Yes, yes. I think that was because of the stories that I was trying to tell  through the work. I think that was   I mean, I   m flattered  (Laughter)  I always thought it wasn   t a very apt comparison, because he   s so  focused on details and realism. I wondered if you   d seen Bill Flores   s  work, the Indian cartoonist.  I have. I have seen his work. I like that. It   s been a while, but he has that  humor.  How would you describe the humor in your paintings?  That   s kind of tricky because you never know how that   s going to be  received. At first, I remember one of the comments was,    Well, the  titles, that   s kind of like Jerome did, put titles on it.    So, I thought,     Well, I don   t want to be accused of copying.    So, I dropped that and  then I had people gripe and say,    No, we liked the titles     (Laughter)  How did you use the titles? Was it a way of zeroing in on the joke?  19  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Yes, what was happening, and the title. After they saw the title, they  paid more attention to what was going on and really got it then. But not  all of them were like that. I don   t always put titles on every one. That  just became something   people expected to see that title.  It   s subtle humor, too. I think a lot of it comes from relationships,  clashes of different personalities. What   s dramatic to you? What do you  look for?  I had one print   it has been a while back   but it was a mother holding a  sick child, at night when they were running fever. It was an Indian child,  an Indian mother, but you could just   if you   ve experienced that, you  know how that is. You don   t want to go to sleep. You want to hold them  and stand up and walk the whole time, if necessary. Some of those  things that I had in paintings, people really connected with that. When a  child falls and gets hurt, you hurt with them. It   s just the different  experiences. Or the fun things, when they start discovering. I remember  one I did with this little boy crawling around, but he discovered a frog  and the frog discovered him. (Laughter) There were people doing other  things, fixing meals, women, but his eyes were big and the frog was     (Laughter) So, I just enjoy capturing those little things like that.  So, the drama in domestic or outdoors scenes, in everyday life, and in  relationships.  Another one that I liked. Indian men   well, men in general, I   ll just put  it that way   wore a lot of khaki a long time ago. I had a man   they  were going fishing, and he had on these boots, and of course, they were  stuffed in the top, wrinkled, an older couple, and the hat. That was all  kind of crumpled, too. She had reached back to take the bucket to carry  it because he had the poles and stuff, but it was just that look they gave  each other, of partnership there. (Laughter) Things like that people  usually connect with, even if that title wasn   t there.  Can you talk a little bit about color in your work? Again, I think it   s a  very subtle use of color.  I remember Linda  Greever  at the Art Market, she asked me one time,     How do you get this gold color or this antique look to it?    I said,    Well,  it   s like oil painting, really, but you   re doing it with this watercolor and  you   re not using the heavy pigment and everything.    I   ve learned a lot.  You have to be careful because if you go back and you   re putting this  antique look to it, sometimes that   ll have pigments that will change your  whole color. So, you kind of have to watch that. (Laughter) But I enjoy  the color. Now, Native American art, by nature, is more dark colors or  20  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  heavy paint, which that   s what they had, but that, to me, gives them  more of a reality of life. So, I don   t know. With facial expressions and  things like that   I had a couple of fellows at a show in Oklahoma City,  they were both architect students, but they looked at it and said,    Pen  and ink?    I said,    No, it   s brush when I do a painting.    And they said,     What?    (Laughter) And they looked a little closer. So, I just enjoy,  again, that flow. And it   s easier to do like that. This lady had brought in  a couple of pieces that could be Charlie Russell   s. And it was on wall  board, wall paper and wall board underneath it. So, we were looking at it  and Linda said,    I don   t know.    It was watercolor, and then there was  emphasis with ink, India ink, and Linda said,    Well, I don   t know  whether that would be       and I said,    Just from my perspective, he   s got  the same flow.    For another individual to come in and pick it up and still  get the same flow would be unusual, I think.  That   s where it   s really valuable to have an artist in the gallery.  (Laughs)  Yes, he   s still going to have to do some other  research . But I think it   s  his.  The grandparent/grandchild relationship is obviously important in your  work. What special opportunities for humor or drama does that  relationship have for you?  Well, being a grandmother now. I   ve always enjoyed children, that   s  obvious. The humor is there, and we learn from older people. That   s  what I remember and relate to, what I learned from my grandmother. I  learned so many skills. We made our own clothes. I was telling my  daughter the other day,    I didn   t have a store-bought dress for a long  time, even up into high school. I   d make my outfit, go down and pick  out the material, and go home and make my skirt or whatever, because  we didn   t have clothing stores right there in the area.    I learned those  things from her, quilting, rag rugs. (Laughs) At that time you didn   t  throw anything away, you used it all. Those relationships with that  grandmother, that   s the person, usually, that has more time to be able to  have that teaching experience. That goes back to Indian culture, as well.  I   m not going to say it   s the only one, I   m just saying that   s usually what  you saw in communities. The older people were the teachers.  We   ve talked about titles for your work. I   m assuming you  get  the  image in your mind before you know the title. Is that always the case?  It   s just amazing. Sometimes you could have a really good idea and  work and work and work and work, and it doesn   t develop. It   s just one  of those things. One of my better ideas, more recently, I sat down and  21  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  within four minutes I had it sketched out and it looked good. You just  go, what? (Gestures) (Laughter)  That was my next question about your creative process. Does it go from  idea to sketch?  I   ve been very blessed in that when I have no pressures around, I can  just draw and draw and draw. The ideas are there. One Sunday afternoon  I did eight sketches. That   s pretty good. That   s pretty good production  because when you get that worked out, then you can go to the painting.  It   s just being able to get that flow. I   m sure that you   ve seen that with a  lot of artists.  So, you do preliminary sketches, and then you sketch again in pencil or  with a brush, and apply the paint?  I didn   t used to. I would do a sketch on the board and paint. And I can  do that if I   m in a real big rush, or if there   s a lot of pressure. (Laughs) I  don   t like to do that because if you want to change something, you better  have not had it in dark pencil. That was one of the things I learned at  school. I say,    Go to school, even if it   s for a semester. You will learn.     Sketches help you get that idea, and that idea can grow. It doesn   t have  to be just one character. I mean, if you get this going, then you can see  how it   s going to be laid out, the balance, everything. Then, too, I came  to realize, it   s not bad to have those records  of the artwork . Creek  Nation called me about a young lady they wanted to send over and   have  us look at her work because she was wanting to go to school in  New York. She   s in her twenties and has a little boy. So, I said,    Bring  some of your portfolio or whatever you have,    but she really didn   t  have   she didn   t know that structure. She didn   t know. She had a few  things, but we sat down and talked about it. I recommended she go out  to Santa Fe. I said,    At least go out there for a semester and see        To the Institute of American Indian Art.  Exactly, right. New York, I won   t even go into that. (Laughs) I   m not  saying it   s not for people, but it   s just scary to recommend     It   s a big transition.  It is. It is.  What is your creative routine these days?  I can   t help it. Sometimes I   ve got to do something. (Laughter) There  again, I do some beadwork. I   m working on a belt right now for one of  22  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  my granddaughters, Skye Wildcat. I   ve made Cherokee dresses over the  years for the girls, and I need to make one now for my three-year-old. I  love to make tear dresses.  The reference to    tear    (as tear a piece of  paper) comes from the construction of the dress. The tear dress is a  twentieth-century creation, conceived and adopted in 1968 as the official  Cherokee tribal dress for women by decree of the Cherokee National  Council.  It   s time-consuming, and I   ve had people telling me,    You  don   t need to be doing that. You need to be painting.    But you need to  get away from the painting sometimes and do some other things, as well.  I enjoy different creative areas in Native American work.  Looking back on your career, what do you think was a really important  defining moment or event?  First off, I think if I had not had encouragement, I probably wouldn   t  have gone on and pursued it. I mean, we would still have probably done  arts and crafts and things like that, but I don   t know  about painting .  That   s always important. I think we need to encourage our young  people, and you go from there. If they really are excited about it, they   ll  pursue it. But I tell young people, too, it   s not easy. It   s not going to be,  wake up one day and you   re famous. That   s just not the way it works.  (Laughs) You   ve got to pay your dues. You   ve got to get in there and  work. It   s not always going to be   you   re tested. There   s no doubt about  it. I can remember thinking,    Well, gosh  This is a great piece,    and not  get that recognition. But that   s okay. Later down the line, someone   s  going to say,    Well, I haven   t seen this before  Where   d this come  from?    (Laughter) So, you never know what is going to take place. I  really have enjoyed every bit of it.  I go back to the camaraderie of other artists. I know one time I said to  Paulette Annesley  wife of artist, Robert Annesley ,    We need to really  look down the line and think about a retirement center for artists.    And  she just died laughing. (Laughter)    An old folks home for artists?      (Laughter) I said,    Well, it   d be kind of lonesome if we don   t get to see  each other anymore.    And the thing is, you don   t get to see as many   artists  anymore. Everybody   s kind of scattered. Looking back, of  course, you don   t realize it at the time, but there was that really hot time   in Indian art , and we saw each other every week almost.  That really creates strong bonds.  Yes.  What do you think has been one of the highlights of your career?  I think, for me, personally, getting to know and meet some really  23  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  wonderful artists, absolutely wonderful artists. I just go through and  gosh, there was so many. Merlin. I knew Merlin way back, before you  knew him  (Laughter) He had such talent   does have talent   but  at that time, he was kind of coming in. I think back about getting to meet  people like that, like Parker Boyiddle. I could just go on and name some  outstanding   Valjean Hessing, and Jane  Mauldin . It goes on and on  and on. That was the highlight, getting to know these people personally  and just being in that experience. If I hadn   t even painted, if I   d had that  opportunity, I would   ve loved it. (Laughter) Quite an experience.  How about one of the low points?  Well, low points were always that struggle of money, to get the next  show. (Laughs) Of course, it got better over the years, but I think back  when we took off, my three daughters and I, to Oklahoma City to a show  and had twenty dollars. (Laughs) I   d think,    Alright, we   re going to do  okay,    and it would work out. You have to have a lot of faith. I don   t  know I   d recommend that for everybody, but we didn   t have any bad  experiences. I think back, how risky that was. You have to be nervous  about it, you never know. But you   re young and stupid, I guess.  (Laughs) You don   t have sense enough to worry about it.  Is there anything we   ve forgotten or anything you   d like to discuss?  I don   t think so. I think one of the outstanding things for Native  American art is the galleries that support it. They really invest a lot. I  oftentimes wonder if they could break even at all because they have a lot  invested. (Laughs) They   ve been very supportive and encouraging and  have helped Indian artists survive. Because you   re not getting a weekly  paycheck. These art galleries bought work to enable artists to be able to  continue. If you don   t have that, you can   t stay in it. We   ve just really  had some outstanding folks that were supportive, not only in Oklahoma,  but Arkansas and different places outside, too. Oklahoma is blessed with  all this culture in the state.  Let   s take a look at some of your paintings. We   re looking at a pen and  ink here. Would you like to tell us about this one?  As I said before, this is where I like that flow. Back to music again. I  think when the viewer views it, they may not be aware of that, but that  gives them a good feeling. It   s the flow, the position with the shoulders,  and the drape and everything. I just love to get that in there, that feeling.  It   s almost like when you   re drawing it, you   re conducting. It   s just one  of those things, the rhythm of it.  And the counterpoint with the little boy and the basket. You   re really  24  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  guiding the eye around. Is this one that you did or didn   t title?  I didn   t title this. Of course, any mother that   s working on anything and  a baby around, they   re always included. (Laughs) They   re curious. I like  to add that because that is usually the case for a lot of women. They  have a lot of responsibilities, but they have that creativity and enjoy  beauty, as well.  Here we   ve got two depictions of children in different situations.  One is a little boy around cows and horses and things like that. He   s  emulating adult behavior and learning to rope. So, he   s practicing on a  skull, on the stump there, and watching, as well, as the uncle or whoever   is  back there, roping a cow. He   s having difficulty even roping the one  that   s just on the stump, much less from a horse, but learning from it.  This one is a little girl. As I said, a lot of people loved the children   images  with the ragdolls. And over here, I   ve used the little dog.  People have asked me about the dog. We had a dog, Connie. We named  her Connie. My kids loved her. She was always there, right up on the  bed. I remember my mother-in-law came and spent the night, and she  slept with two of the girls. She said to one of the girls, because it was  winter, cold, she said,    Well, what   s down at the bottom of the bed?     She said,    Connie.    (Laughter) Connie was down under the cover. But  anyway, this is the children and mud cups. They   ve made little cups out  of mud. My children did a lot of those things. They still talk about that,  today, that most of their toys were made out of stuff from the yard and  around. (Laughter) And they loved it. They didn   t know the difference,  we just created that.  This is a telephone operator, the old plug-in board. We did have a couple  of Native American ladies that worked there in Haskell, in that little  telephone office. I   d go down there and visit and everything. It was that  old party line thing, way back then. They knew everything in Haskell  that was going on. They could hear on these phone calls. I can say that  now, since it   s gone. (Laughter) Again, here is that antique, gold look  that I try to get into pieces that are a part of history or back in time. I try  to give that antique feeling about it. In this one, the telephone company,  locally, made prints of that to give to their retirees.  So, the original was a commission?  Yes.  Would you like to tell us about this piece?  25  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Little Thunder  Brown  Yes, the title of it is It   s That Time Again. Time for a haircut, which  most kids don   t like to do, especially a homemade haircut, which was a  bowl cut, almost.  Sugar bowl?  Yes. So, grandmother, again, is taking the responsibility of that. Of  course, his little sister is just loving it and laughing. He   s not going to be  happy about it, no matter what. Again, if you   re looking in the turn-of-the-  century, that was the way you did those things. You just took care of  it, with the grandparents being the caregivers to the children most of the  time. I like the colors.  They  did well with the gouache on this. It   s still  that antique-y look, but you get the navy blue back there, and it connects  well with the red in his shirt.  This one was titled The Haircut, wasn   t it?  Yes. This was commissioned by the organization for mentally  handicapped in Wichita, Kansas, and they sold prints for their program.  They were the people that started that, for this  print , anyway.  Well, thank you so much, Joan, for your time.  Thank you. I appreciate it. Gosh  I   m honored. I   ve enjoyed the years I  could put into art. I always regret I didn   t have enough time to put in, but  I really enjoyed it. Thank you so much.  There   s more time coming. (Laughs)  I hope so  (Laughs) With three-year-old twins, we   ll see. (Laughter)  -------  -------
