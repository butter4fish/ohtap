 Neurohr  Dickinson  Today is September 11, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. I   m at  the library today to interview a writer, Patti Dickinson. Patti, this  project is titled Spotlighting Oklahoma. It   s one of our oral history  projects here at the library. We appreciate you participating in this  interview today so that we can learn more about you and your  Oklahoma roots.  Thank you. It   s a pleasure to be here.  Tell me a little about your childhood in Oklahoma.  Well, I was born in Wilburton, Oklahoma and lived there for several  years afterward. I grew up knowing that I was part Cherokee with  Cherokee roots and was very proud of that. We did move to South  Central Oklahoma, which is the area of Ravia, Oklahoma where my  grandfather, William Dickson,    Wild Bill    Dickson as he was called,  had been a part-time sheriff. So for the short time, about nine years, that  I lived in Oklahoma, I was very aware of the stories that resonated about  him.    Wild Bill    Dickson was not the official sheriff, but he lived on a  ranch outside of Ravia and whenever there was trouble in town, they  came out to get him and he took care of it.  The schooling that I got in Oklahoma was just the first few grades and  then all of a sudden my parents decided they would move us to  California to be closer to the relatives who had moved out there shortly  after the Dust Bowl. And so we left. That sort of ended my time in  Oklahoma but it never ended my fascination for the state. I always felt  curious. I have two older sisters and I was always asking them,    Where  did we do this? Where were we when we lived there?    And I   ve never  had a chance to follow up on that. I would like to do that.  5  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  And so your grandfather was half Cherokee?  Yes.  Did he speak Cherokee?  Yes, he did. And my mother spoke some Cherokee. But this is oral  history, you know. I   ve not done any genealogical search, but his mother  was a full-blood Cherokee woman who did not speak English. And my  grandfather was half-Cherokee and then he married my grandmother  who was a first generation woman whose parents were from England.  She was a blonde, blue-eyed lady. So it   s kind of a mixture in our  family.  And his name was Bill Dickson. How is that spelled?  It was D-I-C-K-S-O-N. And it   s amazing because my last name is  Dickinson and it   s Danish. (Laughter) Or my husband is Danish.  Do you have memories about what he was like? You were a child and so  what do you remember about him?  Actually no, I don   t have any memories of him because he passed away  before I was born. So I didn   t know him, but it was the stories about  him. He was kind of legendary down there. And when I would run into  people and they would ask me,    Who are your parents? Who are your  grandparents?    I was very proud. I would say,    My grandpa was Wild  Bill Dickson.       Oh, Wild Bill Dickson.    And then I would hear stories  about him. So all of that goes in the memory bank. But no, it was  unfortunate that I didn   t get to meet him.  Do you have memories of Wilburton or Ravia in particular that come to  mind? School years, summers, things like that at all?  Yes. I remember hot summers and I remember a house that we had that  had a tree that I thought reached to the sky and had a swing in it that my  dad put there. I remember summers swinging in that and just thinking, I  am the luckiest girl in the world. You know, just happy. I had a happy  childhood. Wilburton was a very small town and so I remember my  mother told me that I was born at home, the doctor came there and  delivered me and I weighed ten and a half pounds. When I found that out  later, I said,    Oh my goodness.    She said,    I like pancakes with sorghum  syrup.    (Laughter) But anyway, I started out in the world looking   I  have two older sisters, and my father so wanted a son. And, of course, he  was there during the birth and I was this big baby and he thought he had  a boy and then no, he didn   t have a boy. But he said I looked so Indian,  6  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  cold black hair. But anyway, he had three daughters.  Did you grow up in town or out in the country?  It was kind of on the edge of town. Actually it was on the edge of town.  I think now it is on a highway there. I tried to find the exact house. I  think I found it but I   m not sure. With that big tree.  Did you go to town much?  Well, yeah. Yeah. I remember my mother, I guess when I walked I was a  little bit pigeon-toed. So I would walk to the store with her and she  would tell me,    Alright, you put your feet on that centerline of the  sidewalk.    And that cured that. I remember that. And my feet are very  straight. (Laughs)  What other stores do you remember in downtown Wilburton?  Oh, a drugstore. A drugstore that had a long counter where you could  buy sodas. When my dad took me there I would always get a soda. That  was kind of special. And that was about all of the memories I have. I  didn   t actually start school, in kindergarten, until the following year after  we moved from there.  Did you have any big family get-togethers or reunions or holiday  celebrations in Oklahoma that come to your mind?  Well, not big ones but with family it would   ve been my mom   s sister  and they had no children. She and her husband had no children. But then  a brother who had one son and he   s my age, and we   re still in touch and  he lives in Denton, Texas now. But at these family get-togethers, they  weren   t all that large, but there was such story-swapping. I absorbed it.  You know, I could   ve been off playing but I was there on the edge  listening to these conversations. They were very important to me  because I was learning about our family.  And you said that your family left Oklahoma for job opportunities in  California?  It was as much to be with family as it was job opportunities. I think my  father found work in Oklahoma but some of our family had moved out  there. We received letters of how terrific it was and so I think he just  thought he would better our lives, you know. So we went out there.  What part of California did you go to first?  7  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  It was around Auburn, California, sort of northern California. I  remember it was beautiful. It was beautiful up there.  Did you come back to Oklahoma for visits ever in your childhood or  adolescence, after you left?  Only once, which is kind of sad. But only once did we come back and it  was to Ravia and it was nice to see. My grandmother was still alive then.  So it was only once, but it was a meaningful visit. Of course, my  grandfather was no longer alive, but it was like visiting where we lived. I  got to see the school where I went, so it   s memorable to me still.  Tell me about your education.  Well, in California I started school   we moved from Auburn to the Bay  Area and I went to grammar school there. I only went about a year there,  and then at age nine we moved to Fresno, California, heart of the Central  Valley. I finished my education there and even graduated from  California State University-Fresno with a degree in history.  What kind of work did you do after you graduated? Did you use your  history degree then?  No, I didn   t. That   s amazing to me. I went into banking. I worked for a  savings and loan and then a bank. Then I married a gentleman who was  a real estate appraiser. He was in the real estate business and I was  working for a savings and loan. Then I worked as manager of a medical  office for about ten years. Not just managing in the office, I ended up  giving shots, taking X-rays, assisting him in surgery, under his direction.  And then on the side, I also had a decorating business. I was interested  in that and I would do that. I would decorate offices and homes. And  that   s one of the reasons that   in the two novels that I   ve written I   ve  used that in the decorating aspect. But I feel like I   ve had a really varied  career before I began writing. And I think it all helped when I started  writing to draw from the experiences that I   d had in these various fields.  So how did you get started writing?  Well, one thing I want to mention are my volunteer experiences. While I  was at Cal State-Fresno, we had a distinguished lecture series where we  had distinguished lecturers that came from all over the world. And being  in central California, they would be flown out by these big universities  like Stanford and Cal or down in L.A., USC and UCLA. They   re in  California so we had this very savvy director of the university lecture  series, a professor Dr. Pascal. He was able to get them to fly down to  Fresno to our university. So I was one of a four-member committee who  8  Neurohr  Dickinson  worked on   for nine years I volunteered on that while living in Fresno. I  was in charge of the receptions for these distinguished lectures. We  charged money for the public to come and then the money was used for  scholarships.  I spent time with an amazing group of people. I spent two days with  Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Carl Sagan, President Ford,  President Carter. Let   s see, there were so many. Authors and statesman,  politicians. Wilma Mankiller was one of the first people that I ever met.  I got to have lunch with Wilma Mankiller because it was kind of up to  me to entertain them while they were there. And Sir Edward Heath,  former Prime Minister of Great Britain. I got to sit and talk with him and  he spoke about Winnie, what he called Churchill, and Joe Stalin. He  knew them and called them by their first names. You can imagine for a  history major I was just entranced. I had Bob Woodward in my house  for dinner. Some of the receptions I had right in my house. And Edmund  Muskie, former senator, he came to dinner at my house. So here I had an  opportunity to meet extraordinary people and what I found out was, and  they would say that,    I   m just an ordinary person who happened to be  here.    I was so impressed with that. They called themselves ordinary  people but yet they had accomplished extraordinary things. I did that for  nine years while I worked. So that was an important memory for me in  that part of my life.  Do you think that influenced your writing somewhat?  I do. It cannot help but influence your writing, you know. It gave me  confidence to say,    Okay.    And you asked how I went and how I  became a writer. We moved from Fresno. I was married to a CPA, my  husband is a CPA and he had a huge practice. He hired me to decorate  his office and it turned out so well. I was divorced at the time and I just  never left. But anyway, we worked there for five years and it became so  big and so burdensome it was affecting his health and actually mine, too.  So we decided we   d just get off the merry-go-round and we moved to  Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. We kind of almost threw a dart at the map and  that   s where we ended up. But that was the first time, when we arrived  there, that I didn   t have to have a full-time job and all this volunteering.  I mean I   d had a life that was just stacked, filled to the brim. And for the  first time in all of my life, I didn   t really have anything I had to do. And  the way I considered it was, wow, I have a huge gift here of time. What  do I want to do with it?  It was on Mother   s Day 1994. We were out planting rhododendrons and  I have a shovel, he has a shovel. I said,    You know, I   ve decided what I  want to do with the rest of my life.    And he says,    What   s that?    And I  said,    I want to write,    and he said,    Write what?    And I said,    Books.     9  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  (Laughter) So anyway, that was the first time that I had the desire and  the time and the opportunity to study and become a writer. That was in  1994, so that   s when I started writing. I had people say,    Well did you  always want to write?    I never thought about it because I never had time  to think about it. Kind of common.  What do you think good writing is? What is good writing?  That   s a good question because there are so many ways to write. But to  me, good writing is taking what   s up here in the head, in your mind,  your idea, in your heart, how you feel about it, and then to put those  words, somehow transform them onto paper so that the reader feels what  it was that captured you to that story idea in the first place. And if you  can do that, if you can make the reader feel what you felt when you  heard that story, the emotions touch a universal feeling, is the writer   s  term. Then that   s good writing. In both my books there are sections  where when I heard this story I laughed, some parts of it I cried, then  when I wrote it I laughed and then I cried. And I   ve had people say, in  particular, in Hollywood the Hard Way,    That book really made me  cry.    And then I know that they felt how I felt. So I felt like I had  succeeded in my goal to write the story.  Hollywood the Hard Way was published in 1999.  Right.  By the University of     Nebraska Press. It was a Bison book.  So it   s ten years old now.  Right.  What is your perspective of it now?  Well, I look back at it and thankfully, I   m not critical when I look at  like,    Oh wow I should   ve done this or I should   ve done that.    My  perspective on it now is it   s still a great story, what he did. And I did  okay. I   m proud of the story because it   s written as creative non-fiction,  which was very new ten years ago and is not so new now. But that   s  telling a true story and being accurate and yet using scenes and dialogue  as one does when writing a novel so that you bring the characters to life  and you put the reader in the story. That   s kind of a difficult thing to do,  but once mastered it makes a story a lot more enjoyable rather than just  reading facts and dates, like a textbook, unfortunately.  10  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson   Would you share  a brief synopsis of Hollywood the Hard Way?  Okay. Hollywood the Hard Way is about a young Oklahoma cowboy  whose grandfather, a Goodnight, a cousin of Charles Goodnight by the  way, to honor a bet that this grandfather made with a famous movie star,  who was Jimmy Wakely, rode his horse from Guthrie, Oklahoma to  Hollywood, California. The bet was that without a herd to slow him  down his grandfather said he could get there in 50 days. Well, he made it  on the 49th day. One man, one horse, 1,500 miles over some of the  toughest terrain in our country. And the horse that this young cowboy  rode was given to him by none other than Frank    Pistol Pete    Eaton who  was a lifelong friend of Rolla Goodnight, Jerry Van Meter   s grandfather.  How did you find the information that you needed for the story about  Frank Eaton, about Pistol Pete? You have pictures in the book and so  tell me a little bit about how you were able to research him.  Well, for one thing, I did a lot of research right here at Oklahoma State  University and then Elizabeth Eaton, Frank   s daughter, who was in her  80s at the time, I never met her until after the book was published, but I  spent two and a half years with her on the phone. I had my little tape  recorder and I taped interviews with her and then transcribed them. She  was a fountain, of course, of information about her father. Then also I  did a lot of research on the internet about him. But also, I got a lot of the  information about him from the very young man that made the ride.  Pistol Pete spent a lot of time at Rolla Goodnight   s 5,000-acre ranch  outside of Enid. In fact there was a joke that there was a worn trail  between Perkins, Oklahoma, where Pistol Pete   s house was, to the ranch  outside of Enid because he was there more than he was at home. So all  of the conversations that took place at the Bar R Ranch in Enid, Rolla  Goodnight   s ranch, Jerry remembered. I mean they had many  conversations sitting on the front porch. And he actually, Pistol Pete     well, he called him Frank, Jerry called him Frank   he was a second  grandfather to Jerry. He was just as much a part of Jerry   s family as his  own grandfather because Rolla Goodnight and Pistol Pete were just like  brothers.  Any other recollections about Frank Eaton?  I had some contact with other of his   well it was Elizabeth Eaton   s  children who remembered their grandfather and gave me stories about  him. In fact, some of those stories ended up in a book that   s family  published called Campfire Stories. That played a part in my impression  of him. And after the book was published, I did an interview here with  Kelly Burley at KOSU. Along with my interview, he played a tape out  of the archives of KOSU of a conversation between Rolla Goodnight  11  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  and Pistol Pete so I got to hear them talk. It was amazing.  That   s wonderful. Okay, so transition, it is documented in your book  how you learned about Jerry Van Meter and the ride. So the book was  published and you were doing a book tour in Oklahoma. And what  happened from there that relates to your second book?  Well, the book tour that I did in Oklahoma I   d never done before, I do  want to say that. I was a total novice. But anyway, I just called all these  different people and told them about the book and they said,    Your  enthusiasm for this story comes through. Yes, I   d like to interview you  on National Public Radio or TV.    I did a lot of that. And one of the  interviews that I did was called Studio Tulsa with Rich Fisher. I did an  interview with him and it came out that the gist of the interview was that  I need heroes in my life. I admire athletes, but to me they   re not heroes.  They   re well-paid athletes. What I define as a hero is someone who  either does something extraordinary as Jerry Van Meter did in  Hollywood the Hard Way or someone who makes a positive impact on  other people   s lives.  So that station Studio Tulsa played that interview for quite awhile after  that because about two months   I was living in Idaho at the time, and I  received a call from a lady who identified herself as Waleah Turner. In  Hollywood the Hard Way I have to say that there was a line that I put in  the introduction of the book about this waitress who gave me the story  who said,    Boy do I have a story you have to write.    Well, this Waleah  called me and she said,    I just happened to be driving through Tulsa one  night. Just happened to turn on the radio and there you were on NPR  talking about needing heroes in your life,    and then she said,    Boy, do I  have a story you have to write,    telling me she read Hollywood the Hard  Way without actually saying so. And she says,    If you want to know  about a hero, I think you   ll want to know about my grandfather.     Tommy Thompson is her grandfather. So I didn   t find the story, it found  me, and how grateful I am. I really am honored to tell this man   s story.  He is a hero.  That   s interesting that your two books are both about Oklahomans.  You know, I feel like that is perhaps not just a coincidence. I mean the  way they came to me, honestly I feel like Providence played a part.  Because so many people had heard about Jerry Van Meter   s ride and just  dismissed it. When I heard it, I heard it as a piece of history and it just  resonated with me. I was bound to write that story. And the same with  this, the same with the new book about Coach Tommy. So many people  knew him. He   s a legend in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. I was amazed that no  one had ever written this story. As hard as it was and as long as it took, I  12  Neurohr  Dickinson  can maybe understand why but I am so grateful that I was the one to get  to tell it.  Is it challenging trying to write a story when you live several states away  from where the story is set?  That was one of the aspects that after Waleah, his granddaughter   s call,  what she told me about him basically was that he was a coach and he  helped all these little Indian boys and he became their surrogate father  and he took them to the state finals in football. You know and wow, that  sounds interesting but I live in Idaho; the story   s in Tahlequah. I   m  really not sure I could do it justice. In fact I was so concerned about it  that I have a really good writer friend that lives in Edmond, Oklahoma  and I tried to get her to do the story but she said,    No, I   m a fiction  writer. I   m a novel writer and that   s just not my cup of tea.    So okay,  back to the drawing board. Well then Waleah told me about a reunion  that some of the men were going to have at one of the gentleman   s  homes. She said,    Please come back, just meet them and then make up  your mind whether you can do it.    So in my mind at that time I had an  idea that if I did take on the project, I would be writing a biography of  her grandfather.  Well, I spent a whole day with these men. Waleah went with me because  she was afraid they would be hesitant to speak to someone from  California, just a stranger. But I told them I was born in Wilburton, that  three of my grandparents were part Cherokee and I   d already written a  book about an Oklahoma hero. And then I said,    I   m thinking of writing  a biography of Tommy Thompson.       Oh, Tommy, oh,    and that was just  like pushing open double-doors. They were so excited that I would write  about their beloved father, because they talked of him as a dad. So I  spent the whole day interviewing and taping interviews with these  fellows and when I walked out of there, I knew that I had a hero   s story.  And it couldn   t just be a biography because what made him great was  his impact on all these young men. That   s okay. So that was that trip.  I went back home to Idaho and I did a ton of research, read every book  on government-run Indian boarding schools I could get a hold of, I  studied Cherokee history, studied the history of this boarding school.  And then I came back to Oklahoma again. By this time, I   m going to try  to make this work, I   m going to try to do this, I   m not quite sure how.  And then I met one man whom I hadn   t met before. He was a Seminole  gentleman who had been a student at Sequoyah. Tommy was his  surrogate father. He came back and held the same position that Tommy  did as boy   s coach and advisor, football coach, and then he even became  principal at Sequoyah. And he said,    Would you like a tour of the  campus?    Well I hadn   t seen it yet, so he took me around the school. I  13  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  spent a whole day with him and not only did I see every old building that  used to be the power plant and the coal plant and the kitchen and all  these different buildings, but he told me about living there and how they  had to march to everything, just life at the school. And then he recalls  some of the pranks they did and all the funny things, how Tommy just  really came up with some creative ways to discipline them.  After that day, now I realized I know the story. I   ve got the whole  picture now. It   s this remarkable coach, this remarkable Cherokee coach  and this group of young boys who I would say had uncertain futures.  They had no place else to go but be there, they were orphaned. And then  this school, this amazing school with its amazing superintendent. A  boarding school that flew in the face of all of the history that I read on  boarding schools. This was a school that did it right; they loved it. It  wasn   t a bad place, there wasn   t abuse and they thought of it as their  home. So when I went back home I was bursting with enthusiasm but  not at all sure how to put together a three-component story. So that   s  why it took so long. (Laughter) Eight years on and off.  Eight years of writing on and off?  Right. And research, you know, that was a lot of it, too.  There   s a poem in the front of the book. Tell me about that poem.  That poem   would you like me to read it?  Yes, I would love for you to read it.  You know, it was after that very first meeting. Now I   m walking in,  meeting Indian men who are grandfathers and I interviewed, I think, all  20 of them or 19, however many there were there that day. Some even  got teary-eyed when they talked about Tommy and they talked about  their life there and I could feel their emotions. When I got back to my  motel that evening, I wrote this poem,    The Boys of Sequoyah.     We came to Sequoyah Orphan Training School from every  corner of Oklahoma,  Knowing only our own pain and very little of the world outside.  We were Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, and Seminole  We were Seneca, Euchee, Kiowa, Osage, and Chickasha  But we were brothers, blood brothers.  When one of us hurt, we all hurt.  When one laughed, we all laughed.  We played together, pulled pranks on one another,  We fought, we studied, and did our chores together.  14  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  We all had our separate dreams, but we shared an unwritten code  of honor:  Treat elders with respect and do not snitch.  Not ever. Brothers don   t snitch.  That   s great. That was a wonderful way to start your book.  Thank you. Thank you.  That   s really nice. So you   re really drawn to hero stories, you talked  about that a little bit. And for both of your books, you had to do a lot of  interviews as well as reading and research that way, too. So what was  your interview process like? You mentioned that you recorded interviews  so when you would talk to people on the phone or in person you were  recording?  I didn   t record the phone conversations, I only recorded in person.  However, once I met them, these men, and recorded that, what I did then  when I returned to Idaho was I drew up a questionnaire. It was about a  three-page questionnaire, very detailed, and I mailed it to them and then  I mailed it to about 60 other guys. And how I ended up tracing the lives  of about 19 men was those were the men who returned the surveys who  fit into the timeline of the book that I wanted to write and who were  forthcoming. They didn   t just answer questions. I would get the three-page  questionnaire back and then with it I would get yellow pages like  the one that you have there, filled with memories. Some sent pictures.  From that initial questionnaire, then I wrote up other individual letters to  each man. I would get the history of their mother, the history of their  dad, what tribe they came from, how they ended up at Sequoyah. So I  had a full complete background on each of them, how it was they  became an orphan and what led them to end up at Sequoyah. So by the  time I narrowed the field down to about 19 men, then I concentrated on  them. And I would say that I spent probably a good three to four hours a  day on the phone. I had free long-distance calling, by the way, by this  time, which I didn   t have on the first book. I had many conversations  that lasted two hours with them. And getting them started was no  problem. Getting them to stop was a problem. (Laughter) So they were  very forthcoming.  So were you taking notes as you were talking on the phone?  Oh, yes. Actually, I was doing it on the computer. I put on a headset and  I could type faster than I could write. So I did it on the computer and you  know, made a lot of typos but I got the message. So I have a ton of  research in that regard. But that went on for so long, on and off for eight  15  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  years. I learned about their kids who were in high school who are now     one went to Notre Dame, another is enrolled here  Oklahoma State  University . I learned about their kids. But also when they   re talking  about their kids, they   re talking about values they learned from Tommy  Thompson that not only they   ve used in their life, but they   ve passed  down to their children. Milo Yellowhead comes to mind, the quarterback  in the infamous 1949 championship game. He said,    My children were  also raised according to Tommy Thompson   s values and rules.    When I  had a book signing just last week, the wife of Milo Yellowhead walked  up   and she always was the one to answer the phone, and I recognized  her just by her voice. She was so tickled at that. You know, that   s how  well I knew her.  Did you create an outline of how you thought the story was going to go  as you were just getting started? And did that change as you got deeper  into the research?  It did. Well, first of all, I decided that it would be three separate parts.  Okay, that didn   t work. That was my original idea. I mean I really had  several false starts with this book. So when I decided to do it, I decided  to do it just the way it was told to me. But I had to start with the man, the  man that was the reason for this story. And then I found out about this  terrible thing that his father did unceremoniously with no warning, take  him away from his aunt and uncle   s house, he and his two sisters, and  just drop them off. Pick them up and then drop them off at what was a  precursor of Sequoyah, Cherokee Orphan Training School, and the  impact of that. So I thought okay, that   s the beginning and once I had the  beginning then the story just flowed. It was such a relief.  You mentioned that you actually are on your book tour now. Was there a  special event in Tahlequah?  Oh, there was such a special event. And this was something that I had in  mind from the very beginning of the book. Some of the men live in  Tahlequah and occasionally see one another, at Sequoyah basketball  games and such. But there are many that are scattered all over Oklahoma  and some who live in, there   s New Mexico, Florida, North Carolina,  Tennessee. And I thought how great it would be for this book to bring  them back together. Well, Waleah Turner, who is Tommy   s  granddaughter, and her sister, Mary Baker-Shaw, they hosted a reception  in Tahlequah and invited all the fellows and bring whoever you wish.  Okay, I traced the lives of 19 fellows and you know, about five of them  passed away during this eight years, unfortunately. But all the rest of  them showed up with all their relatives and we had between 65 and 70  people there. It was wonderful. They hadn   t seen each other for 50 or 60  years. Some of them didn   t recognize each other.    You got old,       No, I  16  Neurohr  Dickinson  didn   t. You got old.    But I gave each one a complimentary copy of the  book with a special autograph to them. And what I think was the  highlight for me was seeing these men carrying around their book to  each of his buddies and having him sign his,    Will you sign my book?  You sign my book,    like senior day of high school. And then one very  nice thing was Principal Chief Chad Smith, Chief of the Cherokee  Nation, stopped by the get-together and made a speech about honoring  these men for their contribution to the school. So it was, for me, a  phenomenal night and it was worth all eight years, just that one night.  That   s wonderful. When a book is published, does the work end for a  writer?  No. That   s when the work begins. I mean it   s work to write the book, but  the marketing   and especially for a university press book, I mean  they   re not equipped to do marketing. Actually some of the publishing  companies now are slacking off unless you   re a John Grisham or  someone like that. A university press book, it   s totally up to the author to  market it. And so with the first book I thought,    Okay, how do I go about  this?    And so I set up a book tour that turned out to be 16 cities in eight  states. I did it. (Laughter) It was TV interviews, radio interviews. I got  up at 5 o   clock in the morning and appeared on a 6 a.m. Tulsa radio  show. I signed in about six cities in Oklahoma and some are memorable.  I did one on Hollywood the Hard Way in Clinton, Oklahoma where the  Route 66 Museum is. I was there from like 1 to 3 o   clock. And ten  minutes to three, these four people walk in. Two of them are sisters,  obviously, you can see that, and one   s husband was a local congressman  from Oklahoma, the other one, the sister was dating a pilot. They missed  me in Oklahoma City and all the other cities that I   d signed in, so the  one who was dating the pilot, the girls went together, rented a Cessna  172 and the pilot flew them to Clinton just to buy books for their dad.  (Laughter) I mean, now that   s memorable. So I did. And then on this  one, I   m not doing quite as extensive a tour. I   m spending two weeks in  Oklahoma doing promotion work on it and that   s where you reach  people. Nobody can sell a book like an author who   s enthusiastic about  the story and makes that person come alive for the reader.  So marketing is quite important. In fact, Nebraska Press, I had a  discussion with their marketing director. I wanted 10,000 copies. I mean,  I spent five years doing that book and she wanted to do 500. I said,     You   re kidding.       No. I   ve been doing this for 25 years. I know what  I   m doing.    I said,    No, that won   t work. How about 5,000?    Well, we  had, it was almost like a real estate deal, she said,    Okay, I   ll do 1,000.        No, how about 4,000?    Well, we settled on three and she said,    That   s  my final offer.    And then she told me,    I   ve been here a long time; I  17  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  know these things. It   s going to take ten years to sell out that print run.     And I said,    I don   t think so.    I said,    I   m going to market this. I will  market it.    And I said,    If I can   t sell it out in a year, I   ll eat crow. I   ll  put barbeque sauce on it, but I will eat crow.    Well, the book sold out in  eleven weeks flat. How sweet that was. So you know, I learned. I  learned to market just by doing. I   d never done it before, but it   s just  something if you like people, which I do, I like to interact with people. It  was one of the most   three weeks on that particular part of the tour, and  it was one of the most fun times I   ve ever had.  And do the publishers help finance the marketing and the touring and  everything? They don   t, do they?  No. No, that was our vacation, my husband and I. He went with me and  that was our vacation. And I remember the vacation cost about  4,000.  But to me it was worth it to prove that marketing director wrong, that it  was going to take ten years to sell it out. After that she sent some of their  new authors to me, referred them to me to tell them how to market their  books.  Have you ever written out what that takes to market a book? That would  be a great article for a journal or something.  Actually I did write an article and it appeared in Foreward, which  Foreward is the name of the magazine and it   s the Publishers Weekly of  the university press book. It appeared in the February 2000 issue, I  believe. It   s called    Author Platform.    Author platform is what you  bring, what an author brings, to the table. I found out in writing that  article, which is for a national magazine, that if a publishing company  gets two stories that are very similar, one from an author who wants to  go on TV, who is capable of being on TV and radio shows and what  have you, and one that just thinks,    Oh, I   m just going to sit behind a  table and sign books,    they choose the author platform story over the  other one. It was very telling. So yeah, that was a national article that I  wrote that explained just how important and what I did. And it had  pictures of the various   one picture was the couple in Clinton,  Oklahoma who flew the plane there.  That   s good. I   ll have to look that article up.  Yeah, yeah.  I would like to find that.  Yeah. And if not, I have a copy. I   ll fax it to you.  18  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Alright. I guess my next question would be then, of course you  mentioned the marketing, what about advice to people who want to  write? In addition to the marketing,  do you have  any other advice?  Well, I think my first advice is consider how large a project you   re  taking on. And I happen to be the kind of person that if I decide I   m  going to do something, I finish it. I know a lot of writers who get started  and don   t finish. So acquire the skills by either college courses in writing  or however you do it, acquire the skills. Take on the project. Be  organized. And what I did was treat it like the businessperson that I was,  I had office hours. I started work at 9, I quit at 4. I took a lunch hour.  But I was there every day. I called it    derriere to the chair.    (Laughter)  Just acquire the skills and know what you   re doing and don   t give up.  That   s it, don   t give up.  Did you go to writer   s workshops when you were first starting out?  I did. I did. I attended a lot of writer   s workshops and I did an awful lot  of studying at home. I bet I bought probably between 60 and 70 books  on how to write. I outlined them like you do in college. I have a binder  of the outlines of the books that I read.  Did you belong to any writer   s clubs?  I did. I belonged to, well in Idaho the Idaho Writers League, actually. I  wrote two novels, by the way, other than these two true stories, and one  of my novels won the Best Novel of the Year for the whole state, which  was a nice reward. I also belong to the Oklahoma Writers Federation and  I belong to the Authors Guild, which is a national guild. They give  online courses, which I   ve taken, but they also represent writers as well.  You have to be published in order to join that one. I haven   t joined one  yet now that I   ve returned to California and I think I   m going to take a  little break and relax and maybe just think about it. And see if another  Oklahoma story comes to me like this one did. (Laughter)  Well what does Oklahoma mean to you?  It   s home. It   s home. You know, it   s a clich  , I know, that you can take  the girl out of Oklahoma but you can   t take Oklahoma out of the girl.  Well, not girl here, but woman. And that   s true to me. I   m drawn to this;  Oklahoma is   I identify. The very first trip I made back, I felt like, wow  I   m home, I belong here, I don   t belong there. I think even though my  parents moved us at a fairly young age, they were still Oklahomans. I  mean we ate the kind of food you eat in Oklahoma, I heard Oklahoma  stories. All of our relatives gathered at our house. When they came out  from Oklahoma they would come to our house. It   s home. To me, it is a  19  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  Neurohr  Dickinson  grand place of, I believe, people of character. Really. I know that sounds  perhaps phony, but it isn   t. I just believe that the people here   there   s  something that came through from generation to generation that still  exists, very special qualities of people here. And to me Oklahoma   s  home. Every time I   m here I hate to actually go back.  Your writing is part of your legacy of course, I mean the printed word, it  stands.  Right.  So how do you want to be remembered?  Well I guess I would like to be remembered as a person who sought out  the heroes from society, that perhaps sadly their stories would   ve been  forgotten or never heard   and what a sin to me, that seemed. That I  would be remembered as that person who was tenacious enough to bring  those stories to life and it   s very pleasing to me to leave these behind for  the people of Oklahoma to read.  Well we   re very glad that you took these projects on, these challenging  projects, they   re wonderful. Your books are really wonderful. I heard  several people at the program last night that we had at the public library  talk about when they started reading the Coach Tommy Thompson book  they couldn   t put it down. They just wanted to find out what was going to  happen to all these people. So you really have a gift for bringing your  people that you write about to life.  Oh, thank you so much. When you hear someone say they can   t put it  down, a writer, an author, cannot hear anything better. (Laughter) Thank  you so much.  Well, good. You   re welcome. Thank you for the interview today. If  there   s anything else you would like to share, this would be the time.  No, I can   t think of anything other than the fact that it   s been a long  journey for me. Out of a 14-year writing career, you   re looking at eight  and five, 13 years representing here. Plus I wrote two other books. But  it   s a journey that I am so grateful that I took. I came out a winner for it  because of that.  We   re glad that you did.  Thank you so much.  -------  -------  20
