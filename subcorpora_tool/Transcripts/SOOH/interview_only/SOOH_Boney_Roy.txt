 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, January 29,  2016. I   m interviewing Roy Boney for the Oklahoma Native Artist  Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. Roy, you   re a visual artist, writer, and  animation film maker, and your art often combines technology with  language preservation. We   re here at the Cherokee Heritage Center  in  Tahlequah  and we   ll be looking at some of your art here in a moment.  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Boney I   m glad to be here.  Little Thunder Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Boney I was born in Claremore, Oklahoma, at the Indian Hospital there. I grew  up in Locust Grove.  Little Thunder What did your mom and dad do for a living?  Boney My dad is retired now, but he was a construction worker. He did heavy  equipment operation for concrete and my mom was a homemaker.  Little Thunder Brothers or sisters?  Boney No brothers or sisters. Just me.  Little Thunder Lucky. How about your relationship with your grandparents on either  side?  Boney I didn   t know my grandparents on my father   s side. They died before I  was born. On my mother   s side, my grandfather   s name was Toodie  Henson. He passed away a couple years ago now. But my grandmother  was named Sarah Henson, and she passed away about twenty years ago  5  now. My grandmother actually had a pretty big influence on me in  terms of being an artist. She used to always bring me   she   d go to the  mission over in Pryor and get used books and stuff, and she would bring  me these illustrated story books of Sherlock Holmes, War of the Worlds,  and stuff. She was always feeding my imagination with that kind of  thing.  Little Thunder Cool. Tell us a little bit about your exposure to Cherokee culture and  language growing up.  Boney I grew up in a home with Cherokee-speaking parents. Most of my  family, aunts and uncles, everybody, they all spoke Cherokee. If they  didn   t speak it, they understood it and could respond back. I was  immersed in that environment. There were certain things that I didn   t  know were distinctly Cherokee till I got older, like if you stub your toe,  you say ai yo or ee ah. I just thought everybody did that. The first time I  realized that, I was like,    Well, that   s just a very Cherokee thing.    So it  was a big part of my life growing up. That   s what informed why I  wanted to do what I do now.  Little Thunder How about any other extended family members who were artistically  inclined?  Boney On my mom   s side, her first cousin is Brooks Henson, the Cherokee  painter. I grew up down the road from him. As a kid, I would  sometimes go down to his studio.  Little Thunder Cool. What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Boney My first memory   actually growing up in Locust Grove, the big figures  there are Bill Glass, Willard Stone, and Bill Rabbit. Everyone would  say,    Indian art,    and that   s the first three names that pop up. I  remember, quite distinctly, seeing a lot of their work as a kid growing  up. They were examples, showing that you can do this. This is  something that   s a valid way to express yourself. But on the other hand,  the other side of it, as a kid that was always drawing and interested in  art, there were some people that would bring these touristy-looking  magazine pictures and stuff, like the Indian maiden by the river, and  they would say,    Oh, you should do this kind of art.    And I was,    I  don   t like that. That wasn   t my experience. I didn   t know anyone like  that in that picture.    I always wanted to express and show the way I  grew up and the people that I know.  Little Thunder How about your first memory of making art?  6  Boney That   s an interesting question. That   s one of those things where as long  as I can remember, I   ve always been making art. I can   t remember  when I wasn   t. My parents, though, they have the very first drawing I  ever did. They still have it. It was of a tick. It was a round circle with a  dot in the center with the legs. They said I drew that when I was about  two and they   ve had it ever since.  Little Thunder Wow. (Laughter) Art experiences in elementary school?  Boney Yeah, I was always drawing. I was the kind of kid that sat in the back  and would be doodling on pictures and would get in trouble. Sometimes  they thought I wasn   t paying attention. But I was also   a lot of times, if  some project came up, they said,    You want to draw the story book? Or  you want to do this poster for the school? You want to do this or that? I  was the go-to person in school for a lot of that.  Little Thunder You had some encouragement from the teachers?  Boney Uh-huh. I had good   the teachers would always see that because I was  always really quiet. That was the only thing anyone could really  connect with me, in that level. So the teachers used that quite a lot to get  a better working relationship with me as a student.  Little Thunder How about middle school or high school? What were your art  experiences there?  Boney In middle school was when it kind of became more serious, I guess.  Like I said, I was doodling and drawing and all that. I think it was the  fifth grade at Locust Grove. That   s when they started junior high, and I  moved to the other school. There was a teacher there named Mrs.  Roland and she was the art teacher, but she was also the journalism  teacher. I was in the art class and she encouraged me to take the  journalism class, too. In there, I wound up doing cartoons for the middle  school paper. That   s where I was,    This is kind of fun. Being able to do  this. You draw something and it gets published.    The next year in sixth  grade was the next major event, I guess, you would say, is that I met  James Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair is from Tahlequah, but he was teaching art  at Locust Grove. From the sixth grade to the twelfth grade, he was my  art teacher. He had a pretty big influence on me.  He   s a ceramicist, but he encouraged   because I like to draw. I still  draw. That   s my main medium at the moment, still   but he encouraged  me to do this. He   d bring me books and examples of different types of  art and all this. So throughout the years, he always was my art teacher.  Then in high school, no one in my family had ever gone to college. That  was never even a consideration of any kind. Like I said, my dad was a  7  construction worker. During the summers, I would work with him out  on the road. My goal was to do that. I thought,    You make pretty good  money here     As a kid, you   re    That   s really great.    I thought,    I   m  going to do this, too.    My parents didn   t want me to do that. They kept  saying,    You need to do something different, but we can   t afford to  send you to school.    Mr. Sinclair and his wife, Connie   she was the  high school counselor   took it upon themselves get me college  applications. They helped me sign up for scholarship opportunities and  they also took me on a tour of different colleges in the area. They really  encouraged me to do this. So I wound up being accepted into Oklahoma  State.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. Yeah, I was wondering, what drew you to Oklahoma  State University?  Boney I wound up there because when I was in high school, trying to figure  out you   re going to do, drawing, like I said, was my always favorite  thing to do. At that time, I was really into comic books and illustration,  like book illustration and that type of stuff. I was looking at colleges  and no schools had that type of degree program. There was fine arts and  there was commercial art, but nothing specifically in that vein. If it was,  it was way far off, like in California somewhere. At that point, I wasn   t  ready to go that far from home. I   d never been anywhere, either. I   d  always lived in Locust Grove. Locust Grove is pretty close to the border  of Arkansas. Arkansas was the only state I   d ever been to, just right  across the border. So I wasn   t ready to go that far. When I applied to  these places, at Oklahoma State at their program, they had a graphic  design program that had an illustration component. That   s what really  drew me there. I think OU has one like that now, too. At the time, when  I was applying, no schools near had that.  Little Thunder What were some of the standout teachers there for you?  Boney One of my favorites was Carey Hissey. She was a professor in the  design track of the school there. She, initially, she comes across as very  harsh, I guess. She   s from England so she has a different way of  expressing things. She   s very forthright. A lot of the students in the  program were intimidated by her, kind of scared. Once you get to know  her, she   s a wonderful person, a great teacher and she really encourages  you. She and I worked really closely together. She had a background in  illustration, too. There wasn   t a lot of people that were just straight  illustration yet. I wound up taking a lot of classes with her, especially in  the later part of the college career because she taught most of those  independent studies. So she had a pretty big impact on my studies.  The other person I remember quite a lot was Mark Sisson, the drawing  instructor. Again, drawing is my forte, my favorite thing. He recognized  8  that, too. He worked with me quite a lot to expand my vision of what I  thought of as drawing. A lot of people will initially think of drawing as  trying to reproduce exactly what you see. That   s one method of  drawing, but you can go beyond that and get really expressive with it,  with the different lines and mark making. He   s the one that introduced  that concept to me.  Little Thunder Do you remember your thesis show? Was is focused on graphic arts?  Boney Yeah, the thesis show   I think we had like seven or eight students in it.  We, as a group, as the design group, we had to put together the show.  We went with the theme of old sci-fi monster movie posters from the     50s and    60s. I think it was called The Emergence of the Undergrad or  something like that. (Laughter) I did the illustration for the big poster  and some of the other students did the design of the texts and all that.  No, that was called The Creation of the Undergrads is what it was. It  was based on these old movies like the Creation of the Humanoids. We  riffed on that.  Little Thunder How funny. What happened after you graduated from OSU?  Boney One thing I will add in here before I move on to that. When I was an  undergrad, I got the apprenticeship   I don   t know if they still do it or  not   with Bill Goldston. They did the Universal Art Limited Editions  apprenticeship at the printmaking studio in Long Island.  Little Thunder Oh, wonderful.  Boney Yeah, I got that, more towards the end of my college career there. It  delayed my graduation by a semester, but I really wanted to do this. I  went to New York for a semester. Bill Goldston, he   s got connections in  Oklahoma. There   s why they have that at the university, or they did. At  the printmaking studio, we got to work with some pretty major artists  like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. We got to work with them  making prints. That was amazing.  Little Thunder Wow.  Boney I got to work on a big print with James Rosenquist for a while. This is  like a dream come true. It was really great. While I was there doing that,  that really sparked my interest in graphics even more and printmaking.  Then I came back and that semester after that is when I graduated.  Little Thunder Were you doing any Native imagery at all?  9  Boney Not a lot. Not any with printmaking. Just in terms of drawing and  sketching, I was doing that. But I hadn   t really focused on any of it  seriously yet. I was still trying to find my voice as an artist. You   re still  thinking,    Can I do this? Should I do that?    My primary focus at the  time was I wanted to get into comic book illustration. A lot of my work  was geared toward that and more toward the independent type of  publishing. That actually leads into what happened after I graduated  there.  I graduated in the spring of 2002. I was looking for a job and all that,  once you get out. I got a job as a graphic designer called at a company  called CellMark. It was a biotechnology company in Hot Springs,  Arkansas. They specialized in cell staining. I was the designer for the  company. I would do the logos and the catalogs, the website and that  kind of thing. It was a very corporate structure and that wasn   t what I  was wanting to do, looking for. After hours, I was still working toward  this whole comic book idea. Around this time, the Internet, it had been  around a while, but it was really taking off. So I started doing web  comics. I did several Internet web series of different stories. I had  started one when I was still at Stillwater. It was called Plug in Boy. It  was about a robotic boy that lived in the basement that was plugged to  the wall. He couldn   t leave. That gained a small following and I kept  going at it for a few years.  When I was in Hot Springs, working for this company, one of the  readers had contacted me out of the blue and he said,    I   m a writer. I   ve  got this script. I   m looking for an artist to illustrate it. I really like your  work. Would you consider this?    It was one of those things that you  were,    I don   t know if this is legit or anything.    So he sent me the  script. I read it and I really liked it. We started corresponding back and  forth. We hit it off. His name   s Matt Shepard. He   s from Canada. I still  have never met him, but we still correspond quite a lot. We start  hashing out this idea. The basic story is, it was a horror story and it was  about zombies, but rather than the zombies being just creatures or  monsters, in our story, the zombies retained their thoughts and  memories of who they were when they were alive. The flesh was rotting  away, but since they still were people in a sense, they formed together  as a civil rights groups to fight for their rights as zombies. We shopped  it around to different publishers and we got rejected quite a lot, but a  company that was called SLG Graphics out in San Jose, California  picked it up and we had a pretty good run with them. We did six issues.  It got collected into a graphic novel. We went on the comic convention  circuit, doing books signings for a while. That was really fun, but I  wound up quitting the job at Hot Springs to do that for a little. That was  fun, doing some freelance illustration and that kind of thing for a while,  but then, like a lot of lot of things, it falls apart at a certain point.  10  Little Thunder Right. You were getting some royalties?  Boney Yeah. Yeah. It didn   t last, but it was a good run. So I moved back to  Oklahoma and I started working at   it was called the American Indian  Resource Center. I got the job primarily based on my work as a comic  book artist. It was run by Wathene Young and she was always looking  for people to do these grants that she had. They were getting several  grants to go in the schools in the area to work with students, to work  with Indian students for some type of art project. The projects that we  did focused on language and culture and history. What I wound up  doing, I got the grant portion that went to the Creek Nation. I would go  to the Creek schools and work with the students. Then we wound up  making several short animated films in the Creek language. Then I did  some in some Cherokee schools, too, so I had this mix of students that  were working on these various language animations. Again, that was a  grant program so the grant ran out. Wathene is a very resourceful  person.  She basically came to me one day and told me,    The grant   s about to  run out. Here   s an application to grad school.    I said,    I don   t know if I  really want to go.    She said,    Well, you really need to go. It was an  application to the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. They had  recently announced the fellowship for the Sequoyah National Research  Center. That   s what she had given me. She said,    Here   s the fellowship  that will pay for everything. Here   s the application,    she said.    Fill it  out.    So I did. It was another interesting connection after I sent the  application in. I got a call from the research center a couple months  later. It was from Dr. Dan Littlefield out there. He said,    We read your  application.    I thought he was going to give me the rejection thing.  Then he asked,    Did you grow up in Locust Grove?    I said,    Yeah.    He  said,    I know your dad and his brothers and everybody.    Because he   s  from Salina. He knew everybody. Knew my whole family. I said,     Yeah, that   s who my family is.    He was talking about growing up with  them and everything. The he said,    If you   re interested in coming here,  this opportunity is yours.    I took it and that is why I wound up going to  grad school.  Little Thunder That   s cool. Just quickly, your work with Wathene, were you animation  films? Yes or no?  Boney Yes. At that     Little Thunder And you didn   t have a background in that right?  11  Boney Not really. In undergrad, I did a short animation that was an assignment  to do a commercial. You had the option of doing a print campaign or  something, so I did a little animated short using the Orkin Company as  an example. I made this a little thing with bugs having a party in the  basement and the Orkin man comes and runs them out. That was my  first real serious attempt at doing any kind of animation. In the  meantime, I would play around with just making my own shorts. Then I  started doing stop-motion animation, and that led through the work at  Wathene   s, which most of that was the stop-motion animation.  Little Thunder But you didn   t do the Roe Rock  Incident  there?  Boney No.  Little Thunder That was a later product?  Boney Yeah.  Little Thunder But you kind of learned a little bit about how to do that?  Boney Yeah, the animation you just mentioned was part of my graduate thesis.  Little Thunder Okay.  Boney Yes. When I went to the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, as a fellow  for the Sequoyah Research Center, one of my job duties was to go  through their Cherokee collection. The goal of the Research Center is  the collection of Native American writings, whether it   s a manuscript,  newspaper, magazine. Whenever anything is written by a Native  American, they collect a copy of it. But they also have a lot of historical  records. They have a lot of microphone about the Trail of Tears and all  of that. As a graduate student, I was transcribing a lot of that stuff. I was  going through these actual rolls of microfilm, showing the  documentation of moving the Cherokees from Georgia to Oklahoma, or  Indian Territory. So I got really immersed in that story, just by seeing  all these source documents.  In the art department there, as a grad student there, they were    Find  your own way, your own project, what it is you   re going to do.    I told  them, I   d like to tell this story, using technology in a digital format. I  was getting more interested in that after doing the animations and the  other things. So the program worked with me. They didn   t have an  actual animation program there. But the staff, they worked with me  pretty closely and let me develop my own plan. I wound up writing a  script. It was about the Cherokee Removal. It was telling the story of  one family as they got moved out of their house and moved over to  12  Indian Territory. Dr. Littlefield and I, applied for a grant through the  Research Center, and we got the grant from the  inaudible  Foundation  in New York to fund the Cherokee animation. So I did that.  Little Thunder All done in the language?  Boney Yeah, in the language. Actually, in that one, most of my family are  doing the speaking parts in that. (Laughter) That led to doing the other  animation in the Creek language, the Incident at Rock Roe. The reason  that one got made was the Cherokee one had some success with it. The  Sequoyah Research Center had   they still do have a partnership with  the Arkansas Humanities Council. They wanted to   had this project in  which they wanted to show the Arkansas connection to the Removal,  which a lot of tribes passed through Little Rock on the way over. So we  wrote a grant to the Humanities Council to fund this animation. This  one, since we had already done a Cherokee one, they wanted to focus  on another tribe. I, with my connections in Creek Nation, worked up  this. We did the Incident at Rock Roe animation, which is a site in  Arkansas where this occurred with the Creeks fighting against the  government there, I guess you would say. Trying to remove them and  all that, so that   s how that project came about.  Little Thunder I   ve watched them both and they   re really wonderful. A friend of mine,  Lillian Williams, is in Roe Rock, but I love that you took acts of  resistance to tell this very simple story around these acts of resistance.  Boney That was really purposeful in the sense that a lot of scholarship on the  Indian Removal is done by non-Natives. They have a certain   while  some of it is good scholarship and research and publication, they   re  lacking a certain connection to it. For me, having a direct connection to  that as being a Cherokee in Oklahoma   because that   s why my  family   s here. Seeing the source documents and what really happened  versus an interpretation in the scholarly journal or book, had a really  moving impact on me. I wanted to tell a story from the point of view of  the Natives that that was happening to.  Little Thunder After you graduated with your MFA, what happened?  Boney While I was still in grad school, based on those animations that I was  working on, I was invited to give a talk at the National Trail of Tears  Association Conference, which in that year   it was 2007, I think.  That   s when I graduated. That year, they had it in Springfield, Missouri.  I went up there and gave a talk about the work I was doing and showed  the animations and there was a gentleman named Dr. Morton, Neal  Morton, that was in the audience. He, at the time, was the executive  director for education at Cherokee Nation. He came up to me and asked  13  me,    Do you have any job prospects? What is your goal here?    I said     I   m from Oklahoma and in the area and I   d like to move back home.     He said,    What you   re doing is so interesting. We could use someone  like you at the Cherokee Nation.    I graduated and moved into that job  where I still am at now.  Little Thunder Still working in Language under the Department of Education?  Boney Uh-huh. Yeah.  Little Thunder Cool. You   re continuing your studio art on the side this whole time, I  assume?  Boney Yeah.  Little Thunder What was an early show or award that was important to you?  Boney The first award that I remember winning that was related to Indian art, I  was twelve years old, and I entered a piece in the Five Civilized Tribes  Native youth art competition. The piece I did was called The Crawdad  Hunters. It was these two kids in the creek, hunting for crawdads. It was  a little drawing, not so big, but it won an honorable mention. I was,     That   s kind of neat.    I didn   t expect anything out of it. That was  always in the back of my mind. From that age, it wasn   t until 2006,  when I was in grad school that I entered another Native art show. That  was because of being at the Sequoyah Research Center. The art  collector, Bill Wiggins, has his collection there. He would come around  and he would say,    You need to enter this art competition.    I was like,     I don   t know.    I was really wavering on it. Like Wathene, he came in  one day with an application, saying,    You need to do this.    (Laughter)  Little Thunder Nothing like pressure.  Boney Yeah. I told him,    Okay, I   ll enter it.    I didn   t know what to enter. I  didn   t have a piece ready. When you   re in grad school, you   re not the  wealthiest of people in the world. (Laughter) I went to my apartment  and had this application. I distinctly remember, it wouldn   t be until a  couple days later until I got paid. I had twenty dollars to last the rest of  the week. I was looking at this twenty-dollar bill, and it   s got Andrew  Jackson on it, who was the main architect of Removal, and being,  working with all that material related to the Removal at the Sequoyah  Research Center, I just looked at it and said,    I can do something with  this.    I did a pen and ink drawing based on Andrew Jackson   s portrait  on the twenty-dollar bill of him as very monstrous and grotesque-looking  figure. That was the piece that I entered in the Trail of Tears art  show. I   d submitted the image and I didn   t think anything about it.  14  About a month later, the curator here at the Heritage Center at the time,  Michael Yanz, called me and he said,    Would you be available, could  you come to the Heritage Center on this date?      whatever date the  awards ceremony was. I was,    Yeah, I guess I can be there.    Bill  Wiggins, he said,    I can drive you over there.    We rode over there  together, and they started naming off all the winners. They went  through everything, and I   m thinking,    I didn   t win anything.    Then  they announced the Grand Prize Award and I won.  Little Thunder Oh wow.  Boney That was, for me, it was a big shock, but also, I see that as a show that  put me on track to really start seriously pursuing Native art.  Little Thunder Can you describe your style at that time?  Boney I was working in a very graphic format. Still coming from a background  as a designer and being influenced by the comic book style of  illustration. I was working quite heavily in pen-and-ink at that time. The  thicker piece is a pen-and-ink drawing. It does have the comic book  look and feel. The comic book series I   d done had just come out a year  and a half before that. I still had copies of the book laying around, too,  on through and all that. That was about zombies and these scary  monster things and that just all came together. That was a big influence  on how that piece turned out because it was particularly influenced by  that particular, I guess, American comic book style of art.  Little Thunder What was the year of the award again?  Boney Two thousand six.  Little Thunder How important are galleries for you starting out?  Boney It took a long time for me to get into a gallery. Starting out, initially,  with the Grand Prize award at this show, that was my introduction into  the art world, the Native art world. No one knew who I was. I didn   t  know anybody else. There are all these magazines and newspapers of  doing interviews and articles about that particular show. That threw me  in the deep end really fast. Bill Wiggins said   he still serves as a  mentor to me. I still have a lot of contact with him   at that time, he  kept saying, he gave a lot of encouragement to keep making more  pieces and to enter more shows. As the   couple years later, I was still  entering these shows and I was starting to build a reputation and  winning some awards and things.  15  Little Thunder Were you doing the Cherokee Art Market, too, at that point? And  Cherokee Homecoming?  Boney I didn   t start the Art Market until a few years after that.  Little Thunder Okay.  Boney I was primarily doing the Trail of Tears show here and the Cherokee  Homecoming Show here, and the Five Civilized Tribes show in  Muskogee. For years, those were the only venues that I really did  anything for. But on the side, I was still doing some work related to  comic books. That was actually really getting more notice than the  Native art was. At that point, that   s when I decided I wanted to start  merging the two together. I really started heavily using that influence of  the comics into my fine art versus the commercial art I was doing, too.  That led into, I did some contributing work to a graphic novel called  Trickster, which hit pretty big. It got nominated for the Eisner Award,  which in the comics world is like the Oscar, basically. When that  happened, that brought a lot of attention to Native arts and just Native  comic book art, which is still a fledgling movement that is really  happening now. At the time, it was even more in its early stages.  When that happened, other things came along. I started contributing  these stories and illustrations to these various anthologies about Natives  and comics and that kind of thing. I guess one of the biggest, at that  point, in 2011 or    12 (I forget when)    13, maybe   I don   t remember the  exact year   that   s when Indian Country Today approached me. I did  the cover for their magazine and I did an interior feature about the  Cherokee language and the writing system and all of that. That  particular cover was nominated for Magazine Cover of the Year by, I  think it   s the American Society of Magazine Editors or something?  That meant it got put up with the likes of Fortune and Newsweek and all  that. That provided a really big moment of exposure for me. It didn   t  win, but it was still     Little Thunder Fantastic. Yeah     Boney Yeah.  Little Thunder You   ve been giving some comic book workshops, I think?  Boney Yeah.  Little Thunder Did one with Arigon Starr in Tulsa     Boney Yeah.  16  Little Thunder What have those been like?  Boney Those have been fun. It   s interesting to see. And now that art form is  recognized, it   s a legitimate art form now. When I was a kid, it wasn   t.  It was still junk, throwaway kind of art. With people seeing it in  different light now, there   s a lot of people that come out that want to tell  their own stories. There   s a lot of people that   I think, in that medium,  that   s a way that people that normally don   t get to tell the stories, can  tell the stories that way. They have the potential to reach a really wide  audience. So when we do these workshops, we focus it on being able to  tell your own story, whether that   s about your life, or whether you   ve  invented this Native superhero, whatever it is, we encourage people to  think about their experiences as Native people versus what they see as  being published, and then, they can put their own twist on it.  That   s the backdrop. We then go into the basics about visual  storytelling, framing of the images, going from Point A to Point B, and  all that. Talk about basic drawing skills and what kinds of tools you can  use to add the text. We cover the whole start-to-finish idea of doing  comics. In some of the workshops   I did one in Santa Fe a couple years  ago   the people in it will come out with a short two or three page story  that   s complete. Sometimes they   re not long enough to do that, but they  get the basic idea of what they can do, moving forward. We   ve done  some workshops with some language programs from other tribes, for  them to learn how to make a comic book so they can do it in their  language. That type of thing. It   s been really fun.  Little Thunder You   ve traveled out of state a bit to do that?  Boney Yeah.  Little Thunder What are some of the places you   ve gone?  Boney I have been to Santa Fe a couple of times doing that. I   ve done it once  in Seattle. I   ve done it San Francisco. I   ve done it in Chicago, doing  that type of talk. It   s a really popular topic. With Arigon, she   s really  successful with her Super Indian comic series, but she and Lee Francis,  and Michael Sheyahshe and a few other artists, we   ve created the  Indigenous Narratives collective. We   re an organization of Native  comic creators. We have writers and artists and everyone in between  that wants to make comic books. Our goal is to publish comic books by  Native creators. We   re still a startup and we   re still working towards  that goal, but our first project was a small mini comic, which is about  twelve pages long, just showcasing this idea that Natives can make  comics, too. That led to the current project which is about the Code  17  Talkers. Various tribes have their own code talkers and I   m contributing  a story about the Cherokee code talkers of World War I. The actual  book itself will be out this May. We   re real excited. We   re actually  putting out a full graphic novel with this now.  Little Thunder That is wonderful. You had a solo exhibition at Southern Plains  Museum in 2013. Was that your first solo show?  Boney Yeah, it was my very first one.  Little Thunder What was that like?  Boney That was pretty fun. They just invite you to come down to have the  show. I   m still learning who   s who and what   s what in the Indian art  world. I   m friends with Bobby Martin, and I told him about it. He said,     That   s a big deal. You need to do it.    He said that he had a show down  there and that was one of his first solo shows, too. He said it really  helped out his career pretty well. The more people I talked to, everyone  had that same reaction.    That   s a big deal to have a show there.    So I  put together the show     Little Thunder How many pieces?  Boney I think it was twenty-four. For me, it was interesting, as an artist, at  least for me, when you   re working, you   re just on that one piece or two  pieces   whatever you   re doing at that time   and it   s rare when you get  to see all your work in one spot. You start seeing the theme, I guess, or  pattern in your work that, at least for me, I   d never noticed before. It  was,    Wow, they have this this thread that I   d never seen before.     (Laughter)  Little Thunder What   s one of the best compliments that you   ve gotten on your work?  Boney One of the best compliments? I guess there   s two ways to look at it.  One compliment I remember   it   s not really a compliment, but you can  kind of take it as one   is I did a drawing of Senator Henry Dawes who  was the architect of the Dawes Allotment. He basically took tribes for  all their land in Indian Territory. I did from his official portrait. He was,  basically, he was literally eating Indians. He had his hand in   it was  actually in here, I think, up in the gallery. It didn   t win anything, but it  was hanging there and a lot of people were really commenting on it.  Some really liked it, some hated it. This lady, I don   t know who she  was, she said,    Someone told me that you were the artist of that.    I said,     Yeah.    She said,    How could you make such an awful thing?     (Laughter) In a sense, I thought,    Well, she doesn   t like it.    But that  was sort of a compliment to me, because that was the point.  18  Little Thunder Right.  Boney This was a horrible thing that he had done and I wanted to portray him  as the monster he was. The other compliment that really sticks to me is  a few years ago, I went to that exhibit in Paris. I forget the exact name.  It was this real long name in French. Basically got the Salon there in  France, so we had the Native American Indie Art Delegation. It was all  mainly Oklahoma artists, not all of them, but most of them.  Little Thunder Edgar Heap of Birds was there?  Boney Uh-huh.  Little Thunder Center.  Boney Yeah.  Little Thunder I think it   s the Biennale     Boney Yeah. So I was in that. I went to Paris. While you   re there at this show,  it   s this huge exhibition space, it   s the Salon of history that you read  about in history books. It   s this really great feeling that    My art   s in  here now, too.    Being there, you   re in an entirely different environment  than you would be here in Oklahoma. The people that would come  through the booth to look at the art, most of them were expecting, since  it   s in Europe, they   re expecting a certain image of art that they have in  their mind. There   s this one guy that came up and he really liked my  painting that I had. It was a watercolor and it was an image of these  figures wearing the Cherokee Booger Mask, and they   re enveloped in a  lot of smoke.  The idea of it is, it was about dreams and how they can be good and bad  and how do you react and deal with that? This guy came up to me and  he didn   t speak English and I didn   t speak French. But he had an iPad  with him and it had the little translator app on it. He would speak into it  in French and he would show me what he was saying. The first thing he  said, he said,    I   ve always like Indian art. I   ve always been interested in  Native history and that kind of thing.    He said,    Then I see your piece,  and it totally changed what I think of Native art can be.    That really  stuck with me, because I was literally a foreign land, not being able to  speak directly to this person, and it still had this profound impact on  him as a viewer. I thought that was pretty neat.  Little Thunder That   s very neat. What a wonderful opportunity.  19  Boney Yeah, that was great to do that and go see a lot of the actual art that you  study when you   re going to college. You see these things in books, but  seeing a lot of the real pieces is really nice.  Little Thunder Right. You   re working in the language program here at Cherokee  Nation. How has your work, your day job, impacted your artwork?  Boney They really complement each other. Initially, I was hired to do  Cherokee language media projects for the tribe, which was animation  and websites and that kind of thing. At that time, when I first started,  the Cherokee Nation had started the Cherokee language immersion  school. At that point, it was still relatively new because every year, they  add a grade to the school. At that point, it was up to second or third  grade, I forget which, but we were making all this content for the kids  to use in the class, and things to watch. But then they reached that age  where that stuff didn   t really keep their interest, anymore. That led to  finding ways to interact with them at their level. That why I moved into  getting technology to support the Cherokee language. Getting ways to  use the Cherokee on the computer and on their phones, because a lot of  them have phones, no matter if they   re still small, they still have a  phone. Getting to that point, no one knew how. How do you do that?  How do you get our language on that? Being an artist, coming from the  background   one thing I took away from learning design is that,  basically, as a designer, you   re trying to solve a visual problem,  essentially. That problem-solving skill still applies to everything else.  Trying to think of a creative solution of how can we get our students to  retain their interest in Cherokee, in the world where they live now?     How about we do this? We   ll get Cherokee on the iPhone or  whatever.    That led to those projects, and then in turn, impacts when I  go make a piece of art, a lot of my art incorporates the language into it.  I   m not a fluent speaker of Cherokee, like most people my generation.  Even though we had parents that spoke Cherokee, we didn   t pick it up.  Sadly, it   s almost a generation-wide issue. Having these new devices  and tools that you can just have in your pocket, that has access to the  language, I can literally text someone I know, a Cherokee speaker, a  relative, co-worker, ask them,    How do you say this? How would you  write this?    They can text back in the language. They can record it.  They can say it. I can use those types of resources and import that into  my work. As the technology evolved, I can actually do some of my  drawing on these things, too.  I do a lot of my sketching on there, and do a real painting based on what  I   d done on the phone or the iPad or whatever. All that revolves back  into my day job, which, a lot of it is maintaining the relationships with  the technology sector, to maintain our language in these products and  20  keeping the technology world in at the same time, trying to keep it  grounded within the Cherokee community. My job at the Cherokee  nation is being there and making sure our community members can use  it and keep in touch with the business side of it and bring it together.  But that language is always seeping into my personal life and the  artwork. I   m learning quite a lot of Cherokee and my parents speak.  My dad   s a fluent speaker. He can read it and write the language, so I  can have a lot more communication with him, too, now.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful. I don   t know if   I thought that you had been to a  couple of Ted talks. You   ve been at Google and some other places.  Were you involved at all with the efforts to put Cherokee on (Rosetta)  Stone or Mango or anything?  Boney Yeah, we did the Mango software, recently, where Cherokee   s in that  now. Rosetta Stone is a bit of a harder task because   several years ago,  under the previous Cherokee Nation under the administration of Chad  Smith, we were approached by Rosetta Stone to do this. But it led to a  lot of licensing issues and copyrights and stuff that the tribe didn   t agree  to, so it got scrapped. We   re trying again, but some of the same things  are still happening. The Chickasaw Nation recently did it. I know the  director down there of their program, and I   ve been talking to him.  How did they go around this stuff?  Little Thunder Yeah, what were the     Boney We   re still looking at getting Rosetta Stone into it, but we have done  Mango. There   s another program called Duolingo that we   ve been  looking at. On top of that, we have our own projects that we   re doing,  too, apps and that kind of thing.  Little Thunder Cool. In terms of your animation films and casting   and I know you  cast some of your family  in your Cherokee work    but when you   re  casting a film or when you are casting for  Incident at  Roe Rock for  Mvskoke language, do you want to hear people read? Do you go by  references? Do you do combination of both?  Boney It   s a combination of both. A lot of it has to do with just knowing  different people and they   ll know someone that could do this or might  be interested. It   s a big combination of finding because     Little Thunder The voice has to work with the image too.  Boney Yeah, because a lot of times, in Indian Country, if you put out a call for  actors, not a lot of people show up sometimes. You   ve got to know  where they live, basically, to go find them. Then, working with them to  21  elicit a certain emotional response, that   s another challenge in itself,  too. Getting that side of it. There   s another issue. Some people are not  comfortable speaking their language because they feel they don   t say it  well enough. There   s all these other issues at play, so you   re working  with all this, trying to get people to say these lines so you can make this  project.  Little Thunder Right. I was wondering, too, in terms of whether it   s comic books or  graphic novels, I know that often a book has to get reviewed to actually  get noticed. Has it been hard to get people to review?  Boney Not really. In a sense, these days, especially with social media, there   s a  lot of, I guess you could say there are activists online that really keep an  eye out for these types of projects. They latch onto it and they   ll review  it and they share it and someone else picks it up. It goes viral pretty  quickly. A good example of it, Debbie Reese. She does that blog about  the American Indians in children   s literature. She had picked up on the  Code Talkers project that we were doing. At the time, we had plans to  publish the book, but we didn   t have funding for it yet. So we decided  let   s   I finished my story   and we said,    Let   s sell that one as a digital  download towards a fundraiser to help fund this book. Somebody  posted a link, and she seen it and then she reviewed it. Her review hit all  these other blogs, and all these other people, and then we got a lot of  press out of that little thing just because of the social media thing going  on.  Little Thunder Right, that   s just a powerful platform. You won Best of Show at the  2015 Five Tribes Show?  Boney Uh-huh.  Little Thunder What did that mean to you? You had a little bit of history with that show  already.  Boney Yeah, that was really a great moment for me, too. Like I mentioned,  my first entry there was when I was twelve years old, so I had a good  connection there for years. I   m always entering the show there, too.  Again with Bill Wiggins, he   s comes to these shows, and I think he   s on  the Board or he used to be on the Board at the museum there. He   s  always been a mentor, and he always gives me good advice and  comments. I would enter my pieces there and he   d always tell me,    This  museum has been here a long time.    He said,    The viewership is more  traditional, conservative.    He said,    A lot of your stuff, I don   t know if  it   s going to make it here,    but he said,    Keep trying, keep at it, keep  going    so I did.  22  I just kept doing what I do, and as an artist, you   re always trying to  improve your technique, your message. You   re always after getting  better, so I just kept doing my best to improve. Again, my favorite form  of art is drawing because I think it   s the most immediate. You make a  mark and there it is. I did this drawing of Deer Woman, holding a figure  that has a partially amputated leg due to all the diabetes and health  issues. But it   s based on the Renaissance theme of the Virgin Mary  holding the body of Christ in her arms. I transposed that into using these  images from Cherokee heritage and stories and things I was making a  statement on where we are now as a people in terms of our language  and culture, where were going, where we   ve been and what can we do  to reverse the erosion of it. It was a drawing and historically, according  to what people told me, I don   t know how true this is, but they said  drawings rarely win any Best of Show award anywhere. I didn   t  expect     Little Thunder Right.  Boney    at that time, too, I remember I was really busy and I was thinking,     I   m not even going to go to the opening.    One of my friends     her name is Verna Bates, she does a lot of gourd work   she sent me a  text. She said,    Are you going to the show today?    I was,    I guess I   ll  go.    I get there and they go through the whole, again, doing all the  awards, and I didn   t get anything. I looked at her and said,    Well, I  didn   t get anything.    Then they announced the Best of Show and it was  for the drawing. That really shocked me, but I was glad that they  recognized me for that because it   s something as an artist, it   s nice to  get that kind of recognition. Especially from that museum because it has  a long history. Being able to be one of the Best of Show winners there  with some of the greats, like Jerome Tiger, is really an honor.  Little Thunder Right. We   ll talk a little bit about your practices, creative practices. In  terms of your studio work, is it predominantly pen and ink? Or are you  using water colors sometimes or acrylics?  Boney Predominantly, I use pencil, but beyond that, any type of graphics, I like  charcoal, pastel, that type of thing is what I use a lot. When I was an  undergrad, almost all of my work was exclusively pastel at that time. I  still go back to that every now and then, but really, any ink drawing  media, pen and ink. Sometimes I   ll use water color, or pigmented inks,  too. Then, after that, I   ll move into painting, which I do mainly acrylic  painting.  Little Thunder Okay.  Boney I still prefer     23  Little Thunder Acrylic on canvas?  Boney    Uh-huh.  Little Thunder Okay.  Boney Yeah. Those are my two main forms of art is drawing and painting.  Sometimes I   ll do a digital piece and that   s a whole other thing because  some shows don   t accept digital work. Some people don   t think digital  art is true artwork. There   s this dialogue that   s happening right now  about that. I work in that quite a lot, too. Now, I   m moving towards     especially when I do a comic book project, it   s almost entirely digital  now. Because I   m working on one right now for Oklahoma Today  magazine which will come out in a couple months. I   m doing a feature  story in it. It   s based on a Cherokee myth, but I   m illustrating it. It   s  going to be digitally painted. So, I veer between that and actual  painting, but a lot of people don   t still see digital work as valid artwork.  Little Thunder Right, right.  Boney They just don   t see     Little Thunder But when you say digital painting and you   re talking about  reproduction in a magazine     Boney Uh-huh.  Little Thunder    You   re talking about  computer painting ?  Boney It   s a commercial project in a way, too.  Little Thunder Right, right. I   ll be watching for that. You   ve talked about how  important sketching is to you. How about your signature? How do you  handle that?  Boney My signature is, it   s all in Cherokee. It   s my Cherokee name, which is  Konig Kolaha, which means, Konig is the name of   it   s a little berry  that grows alongside creeks. It was also the name of my great-grandfather  on my mom   s side. There   s that connection, but the other  connection to it is they said my mom would eat those berries when she  was a little girl. That   s why my grandma named me that. The second  word, Kolaha is literally it   s boney or skeletal like. That   s what that  means. My dad   s family named Boney, they say it   s a mistranslation  from the allotment era. The family was called Skeleton, but the  translator who was taking the enrollment wrote it down as boney. But  24  the other connection there is the word Kohlon is talking about the raven  as well. In Cherokee stories and beliefs, the raven is often connected to  the Raven Mocker story. There were stories going back on my dad   s  side that some members of the family, that   s what they were. And that   s  why they have that name. That   s the connection there.  Little Thunder What is your creative process from the time that you get an idea?  Boney I do a lot of research on my work. If I get an idea, I   ll start looking for  if there are certain visual elements that I need that might be historical, if  it   s a costume or something. Or if it   s a turn or phrase and if I want to  get it translated, I   ll find, just like I described, the linguistic connections  to it, if there is anything else that might connect to the image visually.  I   ll get all that and write it down and let it percolate for a while. Then,  in the meantime, I   ll do these sketches. Like I said, I   m always drawing  and sketching. A few years ago, going back to social media on  Facebook, I started a project where I do a sketch a day. That forces me  to update and actually do it. I   ve done about 1500 sketches so far now  and I keep throwing them up there. A lot of these are just ideas I   m  trying to work out, but as I put them up now, people will look at them  and they   ll have their input, and I can pull some of that input into the  pieces I make now. I   m getting community input from that into my  work, so I   m not totally isolated over here. I   m trying to make the  connection to the historical record, to the community now, and my  experience growing up as Cherokee, and bringing all together.  Little Thunder That   s neat. How about your creative routine? Is it after  hours ? Of  course, when you   re working, you   re working on your job, but like you  said, there   s overlap. Do you have a routine?  Boney Yeah, what I do, is as I said, every day I try to get some time in,  whether it   s drawing or painting, or working on a project of some kind.  I try to get some time in on it. A lot of that process is a lot of drawing. I  go through, I don   t know how many versions of a piece until I decide  this is what I want it to be. I have all these discarded sketches,    That   s  not going to work. That   s not going to work.    Once I get to that final  idea that I like, then I   ll move either from a notebook, sketchpad, or  sometimes I go outside, I do it on my phone or I   ll do it on an  i Pad or  something. But I   ll move from that to the final piece. Usually, I don   t  work on more than one piece at a time.  Little Thunder I was wondering.  Boney Yeah, that   s never been   it doesn   t work that well. Sometimes when  I   ll get a deadline, but a lot of times, I like to focus on one and get that  one done. Then, I   ll move on to the next piece.  25  Little Thunder So aside from the nowness of Cherokee identity and the idea that Native  People are creating and inventing and revisioning the world around  them right now, what else do you want people to know about Cherokees  in general?  Boney I think, as a tribe, historically, we   ve always had this long history of  being able to adapt and adopt and survive, which a lot of tribes have  that, too, but for us, as Cherokees, we   re one of the most heavily  documented tribes in history. You can go back and look at all these  notes from all these explorers, or whatever you want to call them. I  think that   s more of a friendly term to call them, I guess. You can read  their notes and see what they were seeing and seeing how, as a people,  despite all the intrusions and all the problems and tragedies and all that  that was happening, we still were adapting and surviving and taking  what we thought was best, using for our own purposes, and then, we  would make it ours.  That   s something that I think that we still do. That   s the reason that I  think, one reason, anyway   there   s a lot of them, I guess   but people  tend to see Cherokees as like a leadership role. Some of the things  people may argue about and may not like   some people argue about the  concept of Cherokee Nation adopting a form of government that was  like the United States. But in other terms, that was a role in which the  tribe played a part of leadership. I think again, as people, we   re always  willing to go there, whether if it   s going to work or not, we don   t ever  know, but we   re willing to take that risk.  Little Thunder Looking back on your career so far, what was a fork in the road for you  when you could   ve gone one way, but you chose to go another?  Boney I remember, when I mentioned Dr. Morton who said,    There   s a job  here if you want it.    At that point, I was thinking,    I don   t know if I  want to work for the tribe.    Because as someone that grew up here     I guess it   s like this in a lot of tribal communities   a lot of people don   t  like their tribal government. There   s this love hate relationship that goes  on there. I was,    I don   t want to work at Cherokee Nation.    And I just  blew it off for a while. I was wanting to go into   actually, I had a job  interview in Texas in Dallas with a video game company to do video  design and art and that type of thing. I went down there and I did the  interview. I wasn   t guaranteed the job, but it went really well. I had a  friend that lived there from college and I stayed there with him when I  was down there. He was trying to make it as a graphic artist and he   s  having a hard time.  26  He   s living in this little tiny apartment, and I was,    I don   t know if I  want to do this, either.    You have that moment of revelation that maybe  this isn   t going to work. The game company sent me an email and they  said,    If you   re interested, you got the job.    They had all these  stipulations. One of the things that turned me off of it was I was not  allowed to do any work on the side. All my work had to be with them  and them only. So I turned it down. That   s when I took the job at  Cherokee Nation. But I learned, just a few years after that, the company  went under. (Laughs)  Little Thunder You were being watched out for.  Boney Yeah. Yeah     Little Thunder What   s been one of the high points of your career so far?  Boney The high points. For one high point, when I got to go to Paris, that was  a really high point. The other was getting to work with all these high  technology companies. You get to go visit their campus and see what  they do there. Seeing all this great new innovation that   s happening and  having the opportunity to actually talk to them about the Cherokee  people. A colleague of mine, his name is Jeff Edwards, and I   I guess  about two years ago now   we were invited to give a talk at Google. We  gave, they call them Ted Talks. Basically, we just talked to Google  employees about some aspect of culture, and we talked about Cherokee  language and technology and all that. It got broadcast to all the Google  employees which was pretty big deal.  Little Thunder Very cool. How about one of the low points so far?  Boney One of the low points? I don   t know. I   m trying to think of something  that was really   I think one low point was, I mentioned the zombie  graphic novel? That was called Dead Eyes Open. It came out, I think, in  a serialized format first and they went back and collected it into a trade  paperback new version. When that happened, there was a producer in  LA that was going to come down to the convention because it was in  San Diego, the big Comic-Con convention. He was going to come down  and meet me and the publisher about getting the rights, optioning the  rights for some sort of either TV or movie thing.  We were all excited. I was,    Oh, this is going to be great.    So we had  this meeting set up at this restaurant and the guy never showed up. We  were thinking,    Well, I guess  he was  another Hollywood type, just  talking.    But we come to find out, he was killed in a car crash on the  way down. We were,    Oh.    That was a big shock. We didn   t see that  27  coming at all. We kind of felt bad, thinking what we were thinking. But  it was a big tragedy that that occurred then.  Little Thunder Is there anything that we   ve forgotten to talk about that you would like  to add before we look at your artwork?  Boney Not that I can think of. I think we covered most of it that I can think of.  Little Thunder All right, we   ll pause a minute and get set up to look at some of your  artwork. Okay, Roy, do you want to tell us about this first piece?  Boney This piece is called Twenty-first Century Selu. In Cherokee stories, Selu  is the First Woman and she and Kana   ti, which is the First Man, they   re  an origin story for Cherokees. Selu in Cherokee means corn. In a lot of  the old Cherokee medicine formulas, and a lot of the old texts, they  referred to Selu as Selugee, which means Corn Mother.  28  In this piece here, her arm, you see the letter forms there? That   s  Selugee in Cherokee, but that   s in the old style of Cherokee. When  Sequoyah first developed the syllabary, he had the cursive style and  that   s what that is. It   s not the modern version that everyone is used to  seeing. The piece itself is   a lot of my work deals with the concept of,  as a people, where we were, where we are and how we got there. I like  it to talk about the ideas of our things. There   s a lot to talk about loss of  culture and language and I like to have discussion. Obviously, some  things have been lost, but some things change and modify through time,  too. This piece is about that, how things have changed and how  they   re   are they being lost or are they changing?  That   s what this is about. That is why you see the transition in her face,  showing the skull to a face. The painting on her face comes from the  ancient Southeastern imagery, and that   s By Agadoli,    Forked Eye    they  call it. Some people claim it   s about knowledge while some people say  it   s about death. Again, it   s that dichotomy. What is it and what isn   t it?  The heart, the heart is an image that I use quite a lot in my art, too, the  human heart. It   s about the concept of blood. There   s a big talk about, is  this a blood that makes you Indian? This is about the blood, pumping  through our veins as Cherokees. Is that what makes us Cherokee? What  is it that really does make us who we are? Her heart is exposed, so you  can see where the source of where the blood and life is coming from.  The tattoos on her arm, on the shoulder on the upper right arm there,  upper top arm, I guess, the left arm on her, that   s the Cherokee Booger  mask, which the booger masks have the long history. Some say they   re  used to make fun of the European settlers when they first were coming  in. Some claim they   re used to fight off evil spirits or to represent  sexualness, sexual power. I wanted to use all those concepts on there as  for her as a female because a lot of people discuss, especially in Native  communities, the power  of women .  Women are often the head of the family and in Cherokee society, we   re  matrilineal. Even though some people don   t quite follow that belief  system anymore, even if they don   t, the women still hold quite a lot of  sway in Cherokee families. That   s a reference to all of that. The other  tattooing on her arms, again, comes from the ancient Southeastern  tradition of imagery, showing the mound culture and that type of thing.  It   s a call back to pre-contact times. She   s dressed in more modern  attire. You see the motif in a lot of the Southeastern imagery of the hand  and the eye. Smoke is, in Cherokee and a lot of tribes, too, it   s a method  of medicine and communication. She   s sending a message of some  kind, but it   s up to the viewer to decide what is it that she   s saying. It   s  on paper. It   s mixed media. It   s graphite charcoal and ash. The regular  shape of the paper, it   s shaped like that because it was burned. I let it  just burn around the edges.  29  Little Thunder Right.  Boney That is how it wound up.  Little Thunder Nice.  Boney I used the ash from the paper in the piece itself, too.  Little Thunder Oh, cool. Okay, how about this piece?  Boney This is called Seasons. This is just an all-pencil drawing. It   s a Deer  Woman holding am Indian man with the amputated leg. In the  background, you can see another figure with a booger mask. He   s a  booger dancer. At the bottom, you see the old lady blowing smoke with  the pipe. Next to her is, looks like a Cherokee warrior from pre-contact  time. They are both Little People, which in Cherokee lore, there   s the  Little People. Sometimes, they say if you see one, you   re going to get  lost or they   re going to lead you astray. There   s some turtles way down  in the left corner, again, blowing smoke. Turtles are very important to a  lot of Southeastern tribes, especially on the stomp dance. They use the  shells for that. This piece encompasses the idea of, again, Deer Woman  30  is often seen or talked about as a predator in a lot of stories. But in a lot  of tribal beliefs, there   s never black and white. There   s always gray  between. She   s not always bad. In this instance, she   s helping someone.  The image is influenced from the Renaissance imagery of Mary holding  the body of Christ. This is purposely taking on that image and asking,  do our old beliefs, do they hinder us? Do they take us forward? And on  top of  that , with it coming from a Christian image, it   s superimposing  that conflict that a lot of people have between ancient, early traditional  belief systems versus Christianity. They   re emerging from smoke,  because again, smoke is a motif I use a lot. It   s about the medicine,  about message, sending a message. The owl is behind her. The owl, a  lot of times, is seen as the messenger of bad news or death. But again,  it   s not. Sometimes the owl is just an owl. It   s an omen of good luck,  too. The whole piece is about, again, what   s happening to us as a  people. Are we moving forward? Are we stuck in the past? Is it good?  Is it bad? There   s a lot of complex issues at play and I   d like people to  discuss that when they see this.  Little Thunder Right. It   s got a really nice graphic quality to it. Okay, you want to tell  us about this last piece?  31  Boney This piece is called Honorable. This is an homage to my father. He   s  still living, which I   m really happy for, but he   s in really bad health  now. He was in the Vietnam war. He was an M60 heavy machine  gunner. In terms of what that means, he   s lucky that he   s still alive.  That   s not him, but I guess the image is influenced by him and his  stories that he   d tell me about being there. It   s an image of a Vietnam  warrior filled with some of the elements of the ancient Cherokee  warrior. The war club and the gorgets and the red painted skin, and the  face paint and everything is taken from that idea. So it   s the  modern/ancient warrior kind of image. I know several Cherokee  Vietnam veterans, and a lot of them seem to have been heavy machine  gunners. I think that   s kind of interesting. I don   t know if it   s been  looked at or not. But why were they always on the   were they  disposable? Did they think they could put them on the front line and it  was   was that what was happening? I don   t know.  Little Thunder Right.  Boney There   s a lot of them that have that, but they all came   not all of them,  but a lot of them came back. I guess for a lot of tribes here and for  Cherokees, too, there   s a lot of stories about when people were sent off  to war like that, that their families were home praying for them.  Whether one tradition or another, they were still being looked out for,  and that   s why they say a lot of them did come home. That   s what this  piece is all about. The media is the pigmented ink and colored pencil.  Little Thunder Okay. Well, thank you so much for your time today.  -------  -------
