 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, March 13,  2012, and I   m interviewing Gwen Coleman Lester for the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project sponsored by Oklahoma State University and the  Oral History Program at OSU. We   re at Gwen   s house in Claremore.  Gwen, you   ve been entering shows since 1984 while simultaneously  working as a commercial artist, but in 2000, you turned to fine art on a  full-time basis. Your trademark images are contemporary Choctaw life  in colored pencil and acrylics for which you   ve won many awards over  the years. Thank you for taking the time for this interview.  Thank you for coming.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born right here in Claremore. I grew up here, graduated from high  school, and then I moved around a bit after that. I worked in Tulsa for a  number of years and then Norman. Then I moved to St. Louis, and  Seattle for a year. Then we moved to Altus. Well, we moved back to  Norman, worked in Altus during the week, lived in Norman on the  weekends. (Laughter) It   s complicated. We ended up back here in  Claremore in about 2004.  When you were growing up, what did your folks do for a living?  My dad worked for the Indian hospital here in Claremore. In fact, we   re  Choctaw, and we   re right in the middle of Cherokee country, but that   s  how we ended up here. (Laughter) He got a job with the Indian hospital,  and he worked in the maintenance department there. My mom, actually  she started her working career at the old Mason Hotel here. She gave  radium baths back then.  Wow. Interesting.  5  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  It was unusual, yes. (Laughter) Later on, she became a nurse   s aide, and  then that   s what she did.  Did you have any brothers or sisters?  I have three sisters and one brother. Actually, I had four sisters. One  passed away when she was only two. She   s much older than me, or  would have been.  Your parents were both Choctaw. Your mom from Antlers, and your dad  from Hugo. Did your family history on one side influence you more than  another?  Well, we were around my mother   s family more, probably, growing up  even though I do have some good memories of some of my dad   s  family, especially an aunt on his side and some of his cousins that he  was closer to, but mainly my granny and grandpa on my mom   s side.  Were there any other artists in the family?  My brother, growing up, was always kind of the family artist, but then  he became an accountant, and he didn   t pursue that. (Laughter) My mom  was always into quilting, so I think she had a real creative outlet, there.  She was always good at choosing patterns and colors and all, so I think  that was an influence.  What would you say is your earliest memory of seeing Native art?  Seeing Native art? I think it had to come from being around Tulsa. I can  remember going to powwows and over to the Philbrook and seeing  different art in these locations.  At the Indian Annual? Did you go to some of those shows?  I went to some of those, yes, when I was a kid or a teenager, I can  remember, especially. That, probably, was what kind of spurred me to  do this because in all the years I would look, (I know I was just a kid and  I don   t remember everything) I can remember looking for what is  Choctaw in here because they would always be labeled by tribe. The  artists would be labeled by tribe. I never found any, and I grew up  thinking that all artists must be Cherokee, Navajo, Kiowa. I was outside  of Choctaw territory, I guess, and I just didn   t see them.  You didn   t see that represented up here. What is your earliest memory of  making art or doing art?  6  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Oh, gosh, I drew all the time when I was a kid. That was like my toy of  choice was a box of crayons. That would keep me occupied forever.  I   ve always done drawing, but when I was a kid it was a little bit  different. I drew clothes all the time. I thought I was going to be a  clothes designer. (Laughter)  An influence from your mom   s quilts, maybe?  Could have been. Could have been.  What kinds of art experiences did you have in primary school or  secondary school?  The only art class I ever remember taking in school was in junior high. I  had one art class in junior high, and that was it.  Was the teacher pretty inspirational for you?  It was just such a different thing because we tried all different kinds of  media, so it was constantly working with things I was not familiar with.  (Laughter) I   m not sure it was inspirational rather than,    Oh, what is  this?    We did paper mache. That was totally new and different to me.  Did you think of yourself as an artist when you were young, or did that  come to you a bit later?  I think that came later. I think I really didn   t see myself that way when I  was younger.  You had art classes in high school, as well?  No, in high school, whenever I had the option, I always took the music  classes. (Laughter) I don   t know. That   s what happened, yes.  Were you studying an instrument?  No, that was always the chorus. I was always singing, so I enjoyed that a  lot.  You went to Southwestern Oklahoma State  University .  Yes, I went there to get my bachelor   s degree, but I actually went to  OSU Technical Branch in Okmulgee first. That   s where I picked up my  basics of commercial art. After working as a commercial artist for a  while, that   s when I decided,    Yes, I really need to finish out a  7  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  bachelor   s degree,    because at that point I had an Associate   s. It was  after I started working on that commercial degree, I thought,    I really  like the fine art side.     In terms of your commercial art, did you get a job right after school?  Yes, I did. I felt so fortunate that straight out of school Williams  Companies in Tulsa hired me, and I worked for them. That was my first  job. It was about three years with them before I moved on.  How do you think your commercial art has come to inform your own  work, your commercial art background?  In a lot of ways. A lot. One of the ways I think it does is I was so used to  working with type all the time. The other thing, the other interest I had  was my own language, the Choctaw language. I found ways of working  Choctaw language into some of my drawings, so I do have language in  there. I think some of that drawing, drawing the letters, hand-doing the  letters, came from the commercial side.  Was there any particular commercial art job where you found yourself  thinking,    I need to be doing my own work full-time   ?  I don   t think there was anything in particular from my work that made  me feel like I needed to make that move. I think it was just always there.  It was always like,    Oh, I   d really like to be doing that all the time.     You started doing shows in    84, so you were working full-time and then  doing shows. What were a couple of the early shows that you did?  Red Earth was one of the bigger shows that I got into, although they  never let me into the fine art side. Back in the beginning, they had the  fine art side, and they had what they called    the market.     I don   t even remember that. What year?  Oh, that must have been   what was that,    87,    88? Eighty-eight, maybe.  Somewhere in there. (Laughs) They wouldn   t let me in on the fine art  side, so I got in on the market side, and I was just happy to be there. It  was like,    Oh, my gosh. They let me in     (Laughter)  Had you sold work of your own already? Do you remember your first  sale?  I actually had sold some things, but they were more generic. They  weren   t really Native themes or anything, so that was exciting.  8  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Did you sell at that first show?  The first show, I did sell one big original. I was just ecstatic. (Laughter)  Was it water media?  Actually, it was a colored pencil. It was a large colored pencil, and it  was a still life. I used to do a lot of still life colored pencil pieces back in  the beginning. Because I was working full-time, it was the easiest thing  for me to work on. I could pick it up and put it down in the middle, and  I   d leave things set up and come and go.  Was it with that Red Earth in mind that you specifically began doing  Native subject matter? How did that evolve?  That evolved because I had been wanting to do something that was more  strictly Choctaw for my tribe. I think, actually, I made a huge turning  point when I turned thirty because I went to the Choctaw festival down  in Tuskahoma for the first time, the very first time. It was so exciting to  me. I saw all of these dances and the stickball exhibition games and all  that. I thought,    Okay, now I know what I want to do.    It turned around  all of my thinking right then. Those are the subjects that I   ve been most  interested in since then.  And you regularly do that show?  Yes, I do it. Every year that I can possibly be there, I go. (Laughter) I   m  just excited that now we   re indoors. It   s like,    Oh, we   re uptown      (Laughter)  Who were some of the Native artists that you admired when you first got  into showing your work?  Believe it or not, R. C. Gorman, his loose drawings of Navajo women, I  was always drawn to those back in the beginning. I was really drawn to  his stuff. Then there were others that I really liked. I can   t necessarily  tell you all their names because in the beginning they weren   t people  that I was really familiar with. Or it wasn   t like one artist that I saw all  the time. I guess I just liked the genre. If you went to any place that had  a Native arts show, I was just happy to be there and look. Even if it  wasn   t my tribe, I still enjoyed seeing what other people were doing with  their tribe   s culture and what they were doing with it. That and, I guess,  finding a way to do that for my tribe was   I feel like that   s still  evolving, still evolving.  9  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  You are working in a pretty realistic style, initially. Is that because of  your commercial art background?  It could be. Also, I guess, because of going to school for commercial art  and having to take art history classes and all the fine art in combination  with the commercial side. There were some artists that were not Native  that I tended to see a lot of. They were published enough for you to  actually do some research on them, that kind of thing, and there were a  lot of people doing really realistic work that I found fascinating. I guess  that   s why my work tended to go really realistic in the beginning.  I still have a lot that I do that   s very realistic, but you can look at a lot of  examples where I   ve tried that flat style. I like that, too, then the looser  drawings, looser watercolors. My husband always says when he looks at  my booth, it looks like it could have been done by five or six different  people. (Laughter) I can   t help it.  Well, you have a great range, and that   s good. Producing art is one  thing, and marketing it is another. How did you learn the business side  of art?  I think it just came with time, you know, hit and miss. (Laughs) I guess  I picked up a lot from different sources, some of the jobs that I had in the  past, because I did work for Williams Companies. I also worked for  McDonnell Douglas. It was later bought out by Boeing. I   ve seen how  big corporations do marketing. I   m nowhere near their level or anything.  I don   t have their resources, that   s for sure, but I did see little things that  could transfer over for me.  What role does your husband, Rod, play in the art business?  Well, he   s my framer, my driver, my resident critic. (Laughter) He   s  good at that. He   s a big help. He really is. If there   s anything I need a  hand with, he really is right there. It   s amazing that all the things I get  him into, he tolerates it pretty well. (Laughter)  When you started doing art shows full time, you continued to do Red  Earth and Tuskahoma. Did you do any out-of-state shows?  Quite a few. Some of these have come and gone in the mix. We used to  go up to the one in Wichita at the Indian Center there. We have done  Cahokia  Illinois  off and on. We used to go to the show out in North  Carolina, the Kituwah. We went to that one for a few years. We used to  go down to the one in Dallas put on by the Dallas Indian Chamber of  Commerce. Let   s see. I   ve been to the Heard  Museum  one time.  (Laughter) Oh, and we have been to Santa Fe.  10  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  You   ve done Santa Fe Indian Market?  Yes, I have  I   m always so excited to go. I   m kind of in and out with  them. Some years they like me, and some years not so much. (Laughs)  So, you reapply periodically.  Yes, I do. I do. They don   t always let me in, but I love to go out there. I  love Santa Fe. There   s a lot of art galleries there to look at and learn  from. It   s really an interesting place.  When you moved to Claremore, was that also when you decided to do  this full-time?  Oh, no. No,  the move  came much later. Actually, we were still  working in Altus. See, Boeing has all these little satellite offices here  and yonder, and we worked at a little office that was on the Air Force  base at Altus. Rod and I both worked for Boeing at that time. I did have  some frustrations with my job out there, a few. (Laughter)  He   s the one who started it. He said,    Why don   t you just quit that and  start working on your art full-time?    I kept saying,    Oh, I can   t do that. I  can   t do that.    Then, eventually, I thought,    Well, maybe I could do  that.    (Laughter) So that   s where that started from. He continued to work  for a couple of years after that, but I went ahead and bailed out, and  that   s what I   ve been doing since. My goodness, that was right around  2000, I guess.  What   s been one of the more important awards or honors you   ve had so  far?  Well, award and honor, they would be two different things, I guess. I  think that the first award I ever got in Santa Fe was probably one of my  most exciting because I couldn   t believe they let me in and then I won a  decent award. (Laughter)  What did you win?  I got a Best of Division for drawing out there.  That   s wonderful.  Yes, a Best of Division and First Place for drawing. That was pretty  exciting. I just didn   t see that coming. (Laughter) Well, now, I have to  tell you, though, the one and only time I   ve been to the Heard, I got a  11  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Best of Division out there, too, and that was pretty exciting.  That   s wonderful. Again in graphics or drawing?  In drawing, yes. I guess my biggest awards have always been for my  drawing, although I   ve had some First Places in my painting. When it  comes to Best in Division, it   s been drawing. (Laughter) Now, for the  honor, that would be having Choctaw Nation ask me to go with them as  a representing artist when they went to the Smithsonian last summer,  2011. That was the first time that the National Museum of the American  Indian asked Choctaw Nation to come up and put on the entire festival  themselves because they wanted tribes to come up and represent  themselves the way they wanted to be seen.  So Choctaw Nation handpicked everybody that went and was in that  circle. It was so exciting because they asked me to go in that first year. I  know they   re going back, but I feel like,    Oh, that was such an honor.     That was probably the biggest honor that I may have in my entire  lifetime. I don   t know. That was exciting.  I understand the excitement there. It   s a long trip. It can be expensive to  stay. Did they help you out with your hotel and things?  They were so generous. They paid the expenses for all the people they  invited. It was too expensive a trip for   we would not have been able to  stay downtown like that. Even our expenses on the road to get there,  they paid all that, as well, so it was very generous on their part.  And they   ve been invited back. At least it   s been a great success.  Yes. I   m not going with this group, but that   s okay. I have friends that  were invited, so I   m okay. (Laughter)  In some of the early days, artists would report it was hard for them if  they were artists from one of the five Southeastern tribes to market  images of their own tribes because people were so focused on Plains  images for a long time. Did you run into any of that when you started, or  had that sort of passed?  I think a certain degree of that is still there. I really do. I find a lot of  people, if they   re truly interested, they will ask you questions. I   ve had  so many people ask me,    What tribe is this?    or they   ll say,    Is this  Cherokee?    I think they   ve got some preconceived notions of what  Indian art should look like. I think their knowledge of how many tribes  there are, it   s pretty limited. What I find so amazing is if you look at the  Choctaw Nation, it   s like the third largest in the country right now.  12  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  That   s part of why I stick with it, too. I may not sell the best, (I don   t)  but I   m still out there because I feel like we are underrepresented in the  marketplace. Whenever you   re out there, you don   t find that many  Choctaw artists. I feel like until there   s enough of them that keep  popping up, I   m going to hang in there. (Laughter)  Do you think a lot of Choctaws buy your work, or people of Choctaw  descent that claim Choctaw ancestry? Is that a part of your collector  base?  Some, yes. I have both kinds, people that see it as part of their own  heritage. I do have other Choctaws that buy from me. I have some  people who are just Native art collectors, and I have a few that will buy  from me. One of my biggest clients, God bless them, it   s Choctaw  Nation. They have bought several pieces from me. That   s always  exciting to me because I feel like as long as they   re still interested in my  work, I must be doing something okay. That   s why I love to sell  anything to them that they see as worthwhile.  Have you made any trips to the Mississippi Choctaws?  Yes. Our creation story is tied up with Mississippi. Choctaws    creation  story is tied to the Nanih Waiya Mound, at least one of the stories. There  are several. The Nanih Waiya Mound is an actual place you can go and  see the mound in Mississippi outside of Philadelphia. We had to go  down there. We went down there in the    90s, some time back.  Your whole family or just you and Rod?  No, just me and Rod. That was when we were living in St. Louis, and we  got to looking at the map and thought,    That   s doable.    (Laughter) We  went down, and I took pictures of the area, just soaked it up. They have  a little museum right there. I think they actually changed the name of  their location to Choctaw Mississippi, right there on the Pearl River  Reservation. Anyway, it   s on the Pearl River Reservation where we  went. You can see a museum that they keep there, and we went and  looked at a lot of their artifacts and things. That was pretty exciting.  So those kinds of emotions found their way back into your painting, as  well.  Oh, yes, and genealogy, everything, because we don   t trace our family  too far back. I can   t tell you who was the first person from my family  that came from Mississippi. We don   t know exactly which one came  first. We   ve been doing a little more research on that, so hopefully we   ll  figure that out one of these days.  13  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Do you go out there fairly often now?  Rod   s family is from Virginia, and I have a sister in Virginia, also, so  sometimes when we take trips, we kind of swing out through Mississippi  on our way to or from there. Yes, every once in a while we still make it  back over there. It   s kind of fun. That   s where I bought a lot of my  baskets, my Choctaw baskets, river cane baskets, from down there.  Which show up in your paintings sometimes.  Yes, yes, they do. I still like still life.  You were commissioned to paint a Trail of Tears mural at Tuskahoma.  What year was that, and had you ever painted a mural before?  That was 2003. No, I had never painted anything that huge in my entire  life. I used to like to paint really big, but that was in school and all.  (Laughs)  You hadn   t done much of that, commercially?  Commercially, no. In fact, I   ve never done anything else that big  because the finished piece was six feet by eight feet. It was quite a jump  going from a painting like this to six feet by eight feet. What I did was I  painted it in my little workroom in Norman, and we transported it to  Durant where they were going to frame it. All this time I   m working on  it   I had dining room chairs set up. (Laughter) I didn   t know how to do  this. I had dining room chairs set up, and I had it kind of propped up  against the wall on these dining room chairs because I didn   t have any  kind of easel or anything that was going to hold this up. Everything was  at a nice eye level down here, and whenever I needed to get on the upper  areas, I stood on the chairs, as well, and worked up at the top areas.  It was kind of interesting. It probably took me maybe three months.  Included in there, though, was some time just doing some research  because I felt like I   ve seen a lot of different Trail of Tears paintings, but  I wanted to make sure that we were doing something that would be  really more accurate for the route that the Choctaws took and some of  the things that happened for them. They actually had steamboats in their  route for crossing the river.  It was one of those other muddled up stories where  the steamboats   didn   t work so well, but they were there in the mix, harsh winters, all  that. Anyway, I did a lot of research to try and do something that would  be historically reasonable. You   re painting it like a historical novel, is  14  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  what it is. You don   t have photographs to go from, so you just want to  be as historically accurate as you can get, even though your people are  fictional.  Did you discipline yourself to put in a certain number of hours a week or  a day?  No, I was in a rush the whole time. (Laughter) It was kind of accidental  that I found out that they had wanted me to do the mural. It was  complicated because whenever they were asking for packets to be  submitted for murals, they were talking about a big history mural for the  Choctaw tribe, just a big history mural. I submitted my plan and all, and  then we waited for months, and I never heard anything. One day, my  packet came back in the mail. I said,    Well, I guess they didn   t want  that.    (Laughs)  Rod is like my number-one fan. He really is. Bless his heart. He wanted  to know,    Who could they possibly have given that to? Who got that job  if you did not get that? Of course, you should have gotten that.    I said,     Yes, well, they didn   t think so.    Well, he couldn   t let that go, so he  called down there and was talking to people, and they kept trying to give  him someone else to talk to. He finally talked to a lady there. It was  Beverly Nelson. She said,    Well, no, she didn   t get that job, but has she  agreed to do the Trail of Tears?    The Choctaw Removal, just another  name for it. She said,    Has she agreed to do the Choctaw Removal  mural?    We said,    The what?    (Laughter)  We didn   t know what she was talking about. She said she thought maybe  the chief was going to ask me. I guess he thought she was going to ask  me, so it was kind of accidental.    Yes, by the way, would you do this?        Oh, my gosh. Yes     That   s when the fast and furious research began  because they had a deadline in mind, and I had already missed like two  months of it. That   s why it was like,    Work as much as you can as often  as you can.    That   s the way that went.  It   s a wonderful image. We   re going to take a look at that, too. You did a  painting for a Choctaw festival in Bakersfield, California. Explain how  that came about.  Bakersfield, it   s so surprising. They actually have a fairly large  population of Choctaws centered in Bakersfield. Really, up and down  the West Coast, I guess there   s quite a few. I guess that came about  during the Dust Bowl years.  Urban relocation?  15  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Yes, urban relocation. They ended up with a large population. They  actually have a Choctaw festival out there. One year they just asked me  if I would come out and be in their festival, and,    Sure.     As the poster artist? Was your image chosen for the poster?  Actually, it was chosen for their t-shirt. (Laughter)  Okay  Well, that   s good too  (Laughter)  I think that was probably the first time anybody ever asked me to do  that, so I was thrilled. Yes, it was just fun to go out there and to meet so  many people. You don   t expect to find Choctaws way out there, but  they   re there. We   ve gone back a few times since then, but it is a long  trip. We don   t always make it.  Even when we can   t go, we send them some art for their festival.  (Laughter) It   s nice. Bill and Theresa Harrison are our contacts out there.  They had a lot to do with   it   s the Okla Chahta Clan. That   s what they  call themselves. The chief will go out there, and the councilmen go out,  and they help them with their festival.  That   s great. Have you done any book illustrations or book covers?  Yes, I   ve done two. They were both with the University of Oklahoma  Press. One of them was Choctaws and Missionaries in Mississippi, and  then it   s got the years. I can   t think of the years  1818-1918 . Then the  other one was Choctaw Music and Dance.  So they were books of scholarship.  Yes, pretty much, I think.  What are the challenges? You had your commercial art background. Did  that make it easier, in a way?  Not really because they were only asking me to do the illustration. That  was like the cream. The cream of the crop was right there. In the  commercial side, I would be doing everything but the illustration  because you don   t have the time. You farm that out to an artist that will  do only the illustration. Well, finally, I got to be that artist. That was  kind of exciting. (Laughter)  How has your subject matter changed, do you think, since you first  started showing in Native art shows and doing them professionally?  16  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  My subject matter has become more focused on the Choctaw tribe,  which is what my intentions were to begin with. I really wanted to go  that direction. In the beginning, like I said, I started off doing still lifes. I  think they were kind of a Pan-Indian type of still life. I would use little  pieces from a lot of different tribes and put them together, different  artifact-type things.  Now, whenever I do one that   s a still life, which I will still do, they   re  going to be more directly Choctaw-related. I guess I do more people  now than I used to in the beginning. There   s just no way around it.  (Laughter) I guess I just want to illustrate things that are important to  Choctaw culture, and you can   t hardly do that without the people in  there, so, yes, I do a lot more people than I used to.  How about landscape elements? Do you use many of those?  Yes, I try and do things that would be typical for either southeastern  Oklahoma or for Mississippi, even. I try to be careful with the kind of  landscapes that I put in. Now, in my Trail of Tears mural, that is more of  an Arkansas landscape. What I tried to put them at was the location in  Arkansas where they had just probably crossed the river, the Mississippi  River. That probably is a little bit different, but most of it I try and be  careful to do things that should be Southeastern.  Colored pencil is one of your specialties. What kind of mood or effect  can you get in a graphic piece with colored pencil that you can   t get  with paint?  I don   t know. I guess I just like the way that you can constantly layer it,  and your original color will always be there. It all blends and shows  through. I used to really look at a lot of impressionist-type paintings.  The colored pencil, if you look at those really close, you can magnify  those, and you   ve got an impressionist painting, I think. (Laughter)  In terms of water media, do you primarily work in acrylics?  Well, I do some watercolor. I probably do more acrylics than watercolor,  though.  Have you tried your hand at oils at all?  Yes, I have. I like that, but it is a totally different way of working. I  guess part of my problem is the way it has such a long drying time, and  as a commercial artist, I feel like I need to work faster than that.  (Laughter) So that is different. I do like the effects, though. If you can  hang in there with the time element, I like the way they look. I don   t  17  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  know. Rod keeps saying I should do more oils, so I don   t know.  But your format with acrylics is usually on board or canvas?  Usually canvas, yes, usually.  I thought I saw a painted gourd on your website.  Yes, I do that, too  (Laughter) That is a crazy thing. One time, well,  more than once, I get this idea in my head that I   d like to do something  three-dimensional. At the same time, I haven   t had a lot of time. The  time I have to give to my artwork is like,    I need to go ahead and paint.     Then once in a while,    Yes, I   d really like to do something three-dimensional.     One day I just decided that I was just going to try these gourds. It came  about because a friend of mine, I told him what my ideas were, and I  said,    I would love to try even making ornaments, like Christmas  ornaments on gourds, just to do some painting on a gourd because then  there is an actual three-dimensional item, even though you   re painting  still.    He wanted a painting of mine, and he says,    Would you trade?    I  said,    Well, sure I   d trade.    He says,    Well, I   ve got a box of gourds at  home. I can mail you those gourds if you want to trade for a painting.     He just wanted a miniature, and I thought,    Oh, he   s going to send me a  couple dozen gourds, small.    He sent me like a hundred gourds   (Laughter) I thought,    Oh, my gosh  What am I going to do with a  hundred gourds?     You still have some, I take it?  Oh, no. No, we   ve long passed that hundred-gourd point. That was way  back there. I do them all the time, now. (Laughs)  It   s kind of an opportunity, too, to do a more decorative     Yes. A lot of my subject on the gourds is going to be wildlife, but  sometimes I can really tie that into the Southeastern motifs and  Southeastern animals and birds, especially. Some of the design work,  like the beadwork for the Choctaw tribe, I can incorporate some designs  that come from the beadwork into designs on the gourds, too. I enjoy  that. It   s a little different.  Do you visit much with Marcus Amerman?  Only when we happen to be at a show, at the same show. Marcus and  Roger Amerman were at the Smithsonian, so we had a little more time to  18  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  visit there. I   m always excited to see other Choctaw artists. I like that.  You   ve incorporated text, as you mentioned already, in your paintings  and often in Choctaw language. What do you like about using a text  inside an image?  Well, it just tells a different facet of the story, like the portrait of my  grandmother that I did, that one. The words in the background there are  actually the words to the Twenty-Third Psalms, but it   s written in the  Choctaw language. That was so much a part of who she was. She was a  very Christian woman. She was brought up   her beliefs at the time were  that if you were a Christian, then you were turning away from your  Native ways. That   s how that got started where we started losing pieces  of our culture. She was taught that way from a young person that she  was a Christian, and so she didn   t do a lot of things anymore that she  might have done otherwise. Still, she had a Bible that was written in  Choctaw language. She was very active in her church, Hampton Chapel.  I think it just tells a different facet of the story. Now, I do have a  painting where the words in the background are actually like the ledger  page from the Dawes Rolls. I put names from my family in there.  You   ve still got text, type, but it   s just a different facet because in that  painting, that one was a self portrait, more or less, because I   m in there,  my dad   s in there, and names of other family members are there. In fact,  the Nanih Waiya Mound is in the background of that one, and it   s just,     Yes, we   re all Choctaw.    (Laughter)  When you do portraiture, they sometimes say artists will often draw  themselves subconsciously. The face that they draw will often resemble  their own.  I hear that. Sometimes I think I have used my own face, but whenever  I   ve done that, I know when I   ve done it.  It   s more conscious.  Yes, it is. Sometimes I look at different family members    facial shapes  and things. It   s not that I intentionally want to paint them, in particular.  It   s just that I want them to have Choctaw characteristics. That was one  of the nicest things Mary Robinson ever said to me over at Five  Civilized Tribes Museum. She says,    Your people look Choctaw.    I  thought,    Oh, that is so nice to hear,    because she sees enough art from  the Five Civilized Tribes. She says,    Your people look Choctaw,    and  that was so nice that she said that. That   s the main thing I work on,  though, is trying to make my people look Choctaw.  19  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  In terms of your prep, do you take photographs of people, or work from  live models sometimes?  Most of the time I   ll take photographs, yes. Sometimes I   ll use old  photographs, like old family photographs. I don   t know. Most of the  time it   s not a case, like I said, of wanting to paint someone specifically.  It   s just trying to get some facial features that would be correct for them,  for what I   m trying to do.  What other kinds of research do you do?  I read a lot. I really do. Sometimes that   s where I get some of the subject  matter that I paint is from reading things. I think,    Oh, that gives me a  visual.    I don   t have to think about it too hard. It just gives me  something, so I do a lot of reading. In fact, when Rod and I are  driving   we have gone coast to coast for art shows and family visits and  all that. Sometimes on our driving, I will read to him in the car. I feel  like he knows as much Choctaw history as I know, now. (Laughter)  Can you talk us through your creative process a bit, starting with when  you get an idea?  Oh, that   s kind of difficult. A lot of times, I   ll have ideas that will float  around in my head, sometimes for years before they ever really come to  the surface. They really do.  You   re not consciously aware of them, even.  Well, no. It   s like I have an idea like,    That   s a subject I want to do.    It   s  just a little seed. It really does start that way, starts as a little seed, and it  kind of builds, and it   s only whenever I have enough pieces put together  in my mind that then it starts coming out on paper. Either it   s a finished  drawing, or it   s an idea for a painting. But, yes, I think about things for a  long time before I ever get them out, I think.  You don   t feel obliged to make a preliminary sketch, thumbnail sketch,  or write it down?  Sometimes I do. Sometimes I feel like if I have an idea that   s full-blown  enough, I   ll put that idea down. I do have little scribbles. I   ve got all  kinds of notepads and sketchbooks where I have little things that I have  sketched out. Sometimes they are on little scraps of paper, and then I  stick them in a drawer in my flat-art file, and they fall out of there.  (Laughter) There   s a lot of different places where I have little ideas of  things that I put away for later.  20  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Sometimes that   s a good thing because between the time whenever I put  it on that little thumbnail-type of paper and the time whenever I come  back across it, I think,    Oh, that would be all right, but this might be  better.    By the time I get back to it, I don   t think it   s that I   ve had an  instant,    Oh, that   s what this needs.    I think it   s something in the back of  my mind. It   s been working on that same idea for a long time, so when it  comes out, then I can adjust it a little.  Do you sketch? Do you do a preliminary sketch before you paint with  acrylics? Do you sketch on the board or the canvas?  Yes, I do. I do. I guess that   s the commercial artist in me coming out. I  feel like I want to work with the placement beforehand. Actually, I do  draw on tracing paper a lot (Laughs) just for that. That   s a commercial  side of me coming out there. I want to know if I have something like  this, I can move it around on the canvas. Even if I   ve painted for a ways,  and I decide this is not going well or not quite what I expected, I can  redraw something and then move it around on whatever I   ve got painted  so far. Sometimes I will adjust later.  How important are titles to your work?  I don   t always have a good title. Sometimes it gets whatever I tend to  call it before it goes out in public, like the Nanih Waiya painting. That  might have had a different name except when I talked to Rod.    We need  to load that Nanih Waiya painting in the car.    (Laughter) That   s how  some things get a name.  Then other times, whenever I   ve really got time to think about it and  have the time to give them a good name, I like having a good name on  there. Talk about informing your piece, that can do it. It can change the  whole way you look at something sometimes, by having a good title.  How important is humor in your work?  Oh, I like that whenever I can do it because, first of all, I think it   s part  of our nature to want to laugh and have a good time. My dad was like  that. My dad was always one to tell a good joke. Nothing better he liked  than to trade jokes. That was his personality.  I like having humor in a painting whenever possible. There are stories.  Some of the stories, traditional stories, that Choctaws have, some of  them are kind of funny whenever you think about what they   re really  telling you. I have some paintings that I did for the Child Development  Center in Durant, the Choctaw Nation   s Child Development Center.  They were looking for Choctaw artists to do some paintings of some of  21  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  the traditional stories, and one of the ones I did for them was The  Raccoon and the Possum.  So you   ve got animal figures there. How fun.  Yes, and the story is kind of funny because the raccoon tricks the  possum, of course, into burning his tail off, is where that story goes,  anyway. (Laughter) I like doing that sort of thing.  Looking back on your career, what do you think was a pivotal moment  when you could have gone one direction and you went in a different  direction?  I don   t know. I think when I turned thirty and went to that first Choctaw  festival, I think that was probably a real turning point for me right there.  I felt like,    I know what I   ve got to do now.    That was a real turning  point because my artwork, I was already working on that, working on  techniques and working on the mechanics of how you draw, how do you  paint. That was already beginning, had already been there for a while,  but going to Tuskahoma that first time, I think that set me in the right  direction.  What has been one of the low points of your career?  Well, let   s see. I don   t know if I   ve had a true   well, I   ll tell you, it   s up  and down. That   s the truth. I think if you let yourself, you can get  depressed over having a show where you don   t win an award and you  don   t even sell well, one of those things where you drag home  everything you took, or almost. Those can really get you down if that  was all you were looking at, but I keep trying to tell myself,    We   ve got  to look at the bigger picture here. We   re in it for the long haul.    I feel  like,    Well, that   s a bad show, but you might have a better one next time  or farther down the road.    Some of the best opportunities I ever had, I  didn   t look for. They found me. That   s why I feel like you can   t rule out  anything. Life is going to throw you curves you just don   t see coming,  but, fortunately, I feel like all the curves have been good.  How about one of the high points? You may have already     Oh, yes, I think the Smithsonian. Let me tell you one of the other  reasons why that was such a high point to me, personally. First of all,  just to be asked by my tribe to represent them, that in itself would   ve  been plenty, but it made me feel so good on a more personal level than  that, even. My dad was always such a, I guess you could have called him  a history buff. He loved to read history books all the time. I think it   s too  bad he did not live long enough to see the History Channel on TV. He  22  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  would have loved that. He read all the time.  Like I said, I have a sister that lives in Virginia, in Falls Church, so  anytime when I was younger and we   d go up to visit her, he loved going  through the Smithsonian, any and all of the Smithsonian buildings. He  loved that. He was fascinated by that place. I feel like that was so  exciting. I thought,    I hope he knows I was there     I feel like there is no  way I can look at that and not feel that is truly a high point. My dad  would   ve been so thrilled to see that and to know that Choctaw Nation  wanted me to be there. I feel like I couldn   t have asked for anything  better.  That is wonderful. Is there anything we left out or you   d like to add  before we look at your paintings? I   m remembering your mom coming to  the shows, too. That must have been a good feeling.  Yes. See, my dad passed away. He went to a couple of the smaller  shows, but he had already passed away when I started really getting into  the Native shows. He was already gone. I really hated that he didn   t get  to see that because I know that I would   ve had a hard time keeping him  away. (Laughter) My dad was so bad. He thought that I had so much  talent, which you know that   s just a dad talking about their kid. That   s  all it was. When I was first starting to paint, I was so glad I wasn   t here  at the time. He would carry my paintings down to the bank and show  them to his friends. (Laughter) I can   t believe he did that, but he would  do that. My mom was very supportive, too. She just wasn   t quite as     she never was as outgoing as my dad. That was just his personality.  Well, should we take a look at a couple of your pieces?  Sure.  I   ll have you talk a little bit about this image which is the mural  Choctaw Nation commissioned you to do.  23  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Yes, this one is titled The Choctaw Trail of Tears. It was done in 2003. I  wanted to do a painting that was really specifically about Choctaw  Removal. I wanted to show the terrain. At this point, they   ve already  crossed the Mississippi River, and you can see in the upper right-hand  corner that there   s a steamboat up there. There are some wagons in the  painting. There are soldiers on the left. I really tried to do research to get  wagons and soldiers that should   ve been typical for the time period.  I wanted to show a range of ages, too. That was really important because  it was men, women, children, old people. We have the burial going on,  on the side, in the back, because that really happened. People were  buried along the Trail.  The wonderful texture on this, which was done in colored pencil, right?  Oh, no. That one is actually a watercolor.  It   s a watercolor. Oh, my goodness. You   ve got such subtle shades and  colors with this. It   s fantastic.  Thank you. I just love Choctaw baskets. I really do like doing still lifes.  These are ones that you got from Mississippi?  Yes.  This particular picture you said had a good title, too.  24  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Little Thunder  Lester  Well, it   s called I Shall Not Want. The words in the background are  words to the Twenty-Third Psalms. I took my words from there. I  thought it seemed so fitting because corn was such a staple food for a lot  of tribes, and Choctaws were included there.  You really got the look of the cloth and the apron and all the folds. Were  those hard to do?  No, actually, the cloth is the easier part for me. The harder part is that  necklace she   s wearing, the collar. You see?  The collar, yes. She   s got a beaded collar, too, plus the medallion. I see  that now.  For some reason those collars are always difficult to me.  Yes, but they   re so gorgeous, and then you picked some Southeastern  flowers, trees.  Yes, and there   s some birds in the background.  Beautiful. Thank you so much for your time today, Gwen.  Oh, thanks for coming. I appreciate you having an interest in Choctaw  art.  Absolutely. I   m glad you   re out there representing them. (Laughs)  Thank you. I keep trying.  -------  -------
