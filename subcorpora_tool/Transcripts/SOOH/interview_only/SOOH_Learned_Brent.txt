 Little Thunder  Learned  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, October 5,  2012, and I   m interviewing Brent Learned as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Brent, you   re a  member of the Cheyenne Arapaho tribe, a graduate of the University of  Kansas. You   re known for your colorful, semi-abstract paintings that  have won a number of awards and lots of attention. Thank you for taking  the time to speak with me.  Oh, you   re welcome.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I grew up right here in Oklahoma City. Basically, I just grew up right  here in Oklahoma City. Family, I came from a family of ten. There were  ten of us. My father was a sculptor, and my mother was a chairperson of  the Cheyenne Arapaho tribe, one of the first women of a tribe to become  a chairperson.  Yes, she really broke some new ground for Native women, not just in  Oklahoma but around the country. How did her work inspire you? How  has it impacted you?  Well, the way it happened, the way she inspired me was, for one, she   s a  strong woman. My father, he was the disciplinarian, and I always looked  up to my father. The way she inspired me was, once I graduated from  the University of Kansas I went to her, and I said,    Mom, what can I do  to make you proud?    She says,    Well, Brent, I   ve always been proud of  you, but the one thing I   d like for you to do is to paint your heritage,     because at Kansas I did a lot of abstract, did realism, just kind of  dabbled in the different types of styles.  5  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Growing up, I   d look at Native American work, but it just didn   t grab  me like the European work. So when she said that to me, it kind of lit a  torch under me to where I   m like,    You know what? I   m going to look at  that.    And so as I   ve looked into it and looked at different Native  American work, it just kind of grew into me to where I   ve got to look for  more. I   ve got to find more. With that, I also wanted to do something  that wasn   t seen in Native American work. I   m taking an old concept of  the Plains Indian and bringing him to life in modern day by using bright,  bold colors because colors speak to people.  That was one way she influenced me. That and, like I said, being a  strong woman and just standing up for the Native American culture.  Growing up, again, there really wasn   t too many that were around me  that were very influential to where I was proud of my culture because  let   s face it. Growing up, on a Sunday afternoon sitting there with Mom  and Dad, we   d sit there and watch westerns. In those old westerns, who  was always getting beat? It was the Indian. As a little kid, I   d always  look at it going,    Beat    em     As I got older, I   m like,    Wait a second.  I   m Indian. Why are they always getting beat? Why don   t they ever  win?     It wasn   t until I saw the movie Dances With Wolves that really kind of  kicked it over the edge for me. Growing up, as a young man, you always  go through different things that change you to who you are now, so I  went through a lot of transgression and transition through the years of  just self-discovery. I really found myself by painting what I do now.  Well, your father was working, I guess, in a realistic style then.  My father, his work was always influenced by the Plains Indian.  So he was doing Indian subject matter.  Oh, yes, even before I was born. Growing up and watching him sculpt,  that influenced me to where I think I got my talents from my father and  my social skills from my mother, to an extent. (Laughter) Like with Dad,  when he   d sculpt, it was just a thing of beauty because he   d sit there, and  it   s just like the guy would get lost in his own work. He would even tell  me it gets to a point where he   s just the instrument and it sculpts itself. I  tell people I kind of feel that same way when I paint because they  always ask me,    What do you think of when you paint?    I   m just like,     It gets to a point when you really don   t think. You   re reacting, and  you   re bringing out certain aspects of the painting and pushing other  things back. It gets to a point to where it paints itself.    I   d like to see the  history of the painting as you go along, but yet you get a feel to where  you   re a part of it.  6  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  So, in terms of your grandparents, did they play a role in your life, on  either side?  By the time I was born, all my grandparents had passed away except for  my grandmother on my father   s side. Like I say, I didn   t really know  them. I just heard about them growing up, but I never got the  opportunity to actually meet any of them except for my grandmother.  In terms of your first experience of seeing Native art by a Native artist,  do you remember your first time seeing that?  Yes, I was a little kid because, like I said, my father was a sculptor. He  had a lot of Indian artists that would come over, and one of them in  particular was Woody Big Bow. I was a little kid, and I remember he   d  always come over. We   d always sit around, and we   d play while my dad  and him would talk. We   d somewhat play a game in a way. He would  tell jokes and stuff. As a little kid, we   d understand because it   d be  myself and my four other brothers. There was one time in particular he  came over that he did this piece, and he was wanting Dad to put that into  bronze form.  Dad was talking to him, and he goes,    What are you going to put it on,  Woody?    He goes,    Well, I don   t   what do you mean?    He goes,     You   ve got to have a base for it.    Woody asked me to run down to my  dad   s Quonset to grab a piece of wood, so I ran down there and brought  back one of Dad   s bases and brought it up. He goes,    How about this,  John?    He goes,    No, that   s mine. You need to bring your own.     (Laughter) But, like I said, he would always come over. He would draw  for us, so in a way I kind of got a hands-on with him as a little kid. There  were others, but he was pretty much the first one. I was probably around  four or five at the time.  What is your first memory of making your own art?  The first one that really got my attention that,    Hey, people really like  what I do,    was when I was a little kid. Mom bought me this book. It  was a Mickey Mouse book. It was like from the 1930s,    30s and    40s,  and one of the images was Mickey Mouse being tackled by Donald  Duck. At the time, my older brother played football at Kansas. This one  summer I had stayed with my grandmother, my brother was living with  her, and he was playing football at Kansas. That kind of always stuck in  my mind. I   ve always wanted to draw that.  Also, growing up, is that they hated OU, (Laughter) so the aspect of my  brother playing at Kansas, them hating OU. What I did was I drew  7  Little Thunder  Learned  Mickey Mouse running the ball over Donald Duck, but the way I did it  was   Mom had gotten me this little book. The pages were eight-by-eleven,  standard-size pieces of paper, and I wanted a poster. What I did  was I drew sections, and it got to a point where Mom would come in and  she   d tape it. She was like,    How are you doing this?    because I never  lined it up. Once I got finished, she taped it together, and I had this big  poster that still sits in my grandmother   s house up in Kansas. She was  shocked that here I am, four years old, drawing and not lining that stuff  out but was able to just draw a little section, put it to the side, draw  another little area, and then it all come together as this big giant puzzle  of a poster.  That was the first time that I saw the impact of what art could do  because my mom was shocked and everyone who had saw that. As a kid,  I would remember her telling that story on how her young son did that  and she was amazed.  The other one was when I was in the first grade. We   d had art class. We  had this art teacher who   d worked for   at the time, she was pretty  famous. I can   t remember her name, but I do remember the incident.  She   d come into the school, and she was teaching us how to do profiles,  do portraits. She walked around and gave everyone pieces of paper and  pencil, and she had us draw. When it got to me, I drew myself, and she  was shocked. She even called my mom and said,    This kid could really  draw.    She was really shocked on how well I could draw the human  form, not only that but myself. I did a self portrait.  That was the first time I ever won an award. The award was she got to  pick her favorite piece, and the person got to ride around in a police van  with all the other kids. (Laughter) I don   t know if that was really a big  thing, but for me that was the first thing I won. You got to drive  anywhere you want, and all the kids and the teacher got in the back. We  went to over to the house, and we honked the horn. Mom came out, and  she   d thought something happened to one of her kids. I told her, I said,     No, I won this award,    and they laughed. That was the first award that I  ever won was a police ride. (Laughter)  What a wonderful story  So, essentially, you were getting a little bit of  art instruction at the primary- and middle-school level, or was that just  off and on?  No, I was   you   ve got to realize, with me, the thing is that growing up  I   d always loved art. For me, it was just something I did. It wasn   t  something I thought about, so it came natural. It   s like an athlete  running. He just runs. He does it day in and day out to where,    How did  you become a runner?       Well, I just run. I love to run.    The same with  8  Little Thunder  Learned  me. I just love to draw and paint. The one thing that   s always kind of  struck me as odd is that I didn   t have to go to the University of Kansas  for art, but yet it was always instilled in me from my mom and dad at an  early youth is that you got to know where you came from to know where  you   re going in life.  Where Mom had influenced me, Dad also influenced me. I   ve got this  great culture on both sides, Dad being white and Mother being Indian, so  I combine the two to try to use that to my advantage. With the art, like I  said, it just came so natural. Not only that, I   m a pretty good-sized man.  It just seemed like I was gifted all the way around, sports-wise, athletics,  art, everything except the English language because I   m dyslexic as hell,  but, you know, what the heck. (Laughter) I also noticed my father. He  was also dyslexic. It just seemed like art, he gravitated towards that.  Same with me was that I was always gravitated to art to where it just  came easy for me, and so I loved doing it.  When they say,    Oh, where did you go to school?    it didn   t matter  where you go to school because in the end you   re the one who has to  draw. You   re the one who has to paint. You are the one who   if you  want to learn what you want, you   ve got to go to the library, research it,  figure it out because in art school they   re going to tell you anything that  anybody else is going to tell you: If you like Picasso, well, then go and  look at Picasso. It   s like my father. Even as a young kid, literally he   d  have books on  Frederic  Remington,  Charles Marion  Russell,   Charles  Schreyvogel,  Henry  Farney, books of that sort. He   d go,     Why don   t you draw one of these images?     It got to a point where once you do something repetitiously, it   s going to  come naturally to where you don   t have to think about it. As a young  kid, I did that. I was looking at Remington and Russell   s work. See, that  was my influence to Indian art as a kid because we didn   t have too many  Native American art books at that time because at that time there really  wasn   t that many. When I went to college, a lot of the teachers would  just go,    Go ahead and paint.    It was a free-for-all. They didn   t really sit  down and teach you. I   d sit there and listen to my father when he   d tell  his stories of when he was in art school at Kansas. They actually took  classes with pre-law students. They took classes with business students.  They took classes with medical students because as an artist, you touch  on all those aspects. It was more of a traditional     So, they had the art students in your program     Well, that was my father. With me, you   re talking thirty years later. The  academics of it had changed. When my father was in college, when he  was taking art school, he took classes where they went in there and  9  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  looked at cadavers. When I took art school, they just gave us a picture of  what a cadaver looked like. It was totally different, but it boils down to,  is that it   s either you have it or you don   t. You either have the talent, or  you don   t. It   s self-drive. You   ve got to want it. That   s all I can say on  that is that when it comes to art, you either have it or you don   t. You   ve  got to work on it. Every artist, whether they went to college or not,  they   re self-taught because it boils down to, is you   re the one who   s  doing the work.  How early did you decide you were going to be an artist?  I was a little kid, little kid. As soon as I was able to walk and run, the  first thing I saw was Dad sitting there sculpting. I knew that   s what I  wanted to do, not only that, my father, what he was doing, but the things  I   d watch on public access TV. We grew up on that: Sesame Street,  Electric Company, Zoom. Some of the earliest artists that I watched were  Bob Ross, and there was   Professor Artist was his name. There was  another art guy on those shows that we used to watch as kids. As a  young kid, the cheapest form of entertainment was a piece of paper and  a crayon. We didn   t have the luxury of going out and getting a bunch of  toys. If we got a toy, you   ve got to realize, I   m the sixth boy. It was new  to me, but it was old to my older brother. Art was always a way to play  because you   d always do games.  When did you sell your first piece of art?  First piece of art that I think I ever sold was   golly. Well, the first one I  can actually remember as an adult was when I was a senior at Kansas.  One of the guys I worked for at the Alumni Center, he played football  with my brother when they both played at Kansas, and he said,    Can you  do a portrait of my dog? I was really close to him.    I could see it meant a  lot to him. I said,    Yes, sure. Just give me a photograph of him, and I   ll  have something for you in the next few days.     He gave me a photograph of his dog. I did a charcoal rendition of him,  and he broke down, and he cried. He goes,    It looks so much like my  dog, I was shocked.    He goes,    I   ll be honest with you. I didn   t realize  that you were that good.    I said,    Well, I told you I could draw. It   s just  you never believed me.    (Laughter) He goes,    Well, I knew your  brother. You guys act alike, but yet you are so much different in the  aspect when it comes to your actual talent that I was just really  shocked.    Then after that, I   d gotten other little commission pieces from  not only his friends but other people, but the first piece I ever sold for  money was a piece done for my brother   s friend of his portrait of his  dog.  10  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  So you had a little bit of money coming in that way.  Yes.  What did you do when you got out of school?  Just like any young man trying to find themselves. It took a little bit, but,  again, it came back to Mom because I always looked up to her. She said,     You need to do this show. It   s right there in Lawrence. You live right  there in Lawrence. It   s called the Haskell Indian Art Market.    So I said,     Okay. I don   t know really what to do,    because, as I said, in college  they never really tell you how to prepare yourself on a portfolio or how  to basically sell yourself. Mom, being a chairperson of the tribe,  knowing a lot of people, and knowing the ins and outs, she goes,    Well,  I   ll help you with that.    So she helped me with my first show, which  was   it happened in Lawrence.  Did they drive up, too?  Yes, they drove up. That very first show, again, I didn   t know what to  expect, so I just brought my artwork there. I didn   t realize you had to  bring your own screens to hang it, so we went out and made a makeshift  screen. (Laughter) I was kind of shocked on just the overall appreciation  that people had, not only for my stuff but for my comrades that were all  up there.  You were doing your first qualitative art show.  The very first show, yes, and it was really, it was just really beautiful.  There   s no other words really to say other than beautiful because you   re  walking around, you   re seeing not only paintings but drawings and  pottery, rugs, beadwork, jewelry, not only that but dance. I   d seen that  earlier in my life. When we were kids we   d go to powwows and stuff,  but to actually sit there and partake, saying,    Hey, I   m part of this. I   m  putting this out there. This is me. This is what I   m about,    it was a hell  of an experience. It was intoxicating. It got to a point to where it   s  almost like a drug. You need more of it because when you talk to people  who are just like you, you   ve been found. After college, like I said, I was  lost, but once I did that very first show, I found myself.  Do you remember the year, Brent?  It was in    94.  In    94, okay. So you started checking into shows. Did you approach  galleries?  11  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  No, I had the fortunate to where galleries approached me. I did search  for shows, and the way your typical Indian artist does a show is they ask  around. Say,    Hey how   s that show going? How   s that?       Don   t do that  one.       Do this one.       Heard bad things.    It   s just word of mouth. It   s  just like anything in life. You   re going to have your ups and downs, your  tribulations, and so it   s just a matter of trying to find your niche and your  market. It just takes a little time.  Now, when you did the Haskell show, were you primarily doing acrylic  on canvas? What was your subject matter and material?  It   s just like a musician. When you hear him when he first comes out, he  plays one way. You hear him five years later, he changes his tune. You  hear him another five years, his music. You change with the times. You  find yourself. Your work and you grow as one, and so you   re going to  change with it. At that time, I was doing a lot of pencil drawings and  charcoal drawings. Then that led to oil paints and then eventually  acrylics and then oil pastels. You branch out, and you dabble with a little  bit of everything else until you find what works and what doesn   t. At  that time, I was mainly working in charcoal drawings.  What was an early award that really stands out for you, competitive  award?  To be honest with you, I couldn   t think of one because (and this is going  to sound strange and weird, but I   m like my father) I really don   t believe  in awards because that eliminates your competition. For one, the people  who choose the winners and losers are somewhat biased to begin with.  Dad always instilled in me, and he always taught all the way until the  day he passed, was that your art should stand on its own. Anytime I   ve  ever gotten a ribbon or whatnot, it didn   t really mean too much to me.  There was a couple of occasions to where I   ve met famous people that  were going to give me something, and it didn   t really mean too much to  me because, for one, Mom wasn   t there, two, I didn   t really care too  much about the award, just being honest, and three, what Dad said to me  as a young man always kind of stuck with me, that awards, they  eliminate competition. Like I said, it boils down to is that it   s a bias  thing and that he never believed into it. I loved my father so much, I also  have that same mind thought, same thoughts.  So you haven   t really tried particularly hard to enter competitive shows?  To be honest with you, not really because when I go out south to the  Southwest, when I do shows out there, I notice how (and this is going to  12  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  sound bad) they look down upon the Plains Indian. They really do. I tell  people that, and they   re like,    Oh, no     I say,    Hey, believe me. They  do.    It   s a different world. There   s politics in everything, especially with  art.  Another thing is when I got into art, I didn   t realize how corrupt it is  sometimes with the galleries and how the museums and how many  people will backstab you and everything else. It   s just literally amazing.  I got friends who are ex-drug addicts and everything. They   ve told me  their story, and I go,    Hey, dude, I   ve pretty much done the same thing  without the drugs.    (Laughter) It literally is amazing, yet with art, it   s  taken me to places that I didn   t know about. I   ve been introduced to  people I would   ve never met. That   s the beauty of it.  What is one of the memorable places you   ve gone on an art show?  Well, growing up watching commercials of Disneyland or Disneyworld  and thinking,    Hey, Mom and Dad, are you going to       Then again,  hell, there   s ten of us, so naturally we couldn   t afford all of us to go. One  of the things that kind of sticks out was when the State of Oklahoma  contacted me and said,    Hey, we   d like for you to represent Oklahoma at  Disneyworld,    and it was through my art.  It was in Florida, right?  Florida. It was in    07, the centennial of the statehood. For one, I felt  proud to be an Oklahoman, and two, I felt proud not only representing  Oklahoma but my tribe and my artwork. Going down there on that  experience was just a blast.  What are some of the things you did?  Down there?  Yes. (Laughs)  It   s not for tape or video. I   m sorry. (Laughs)  Okay, but you did check out Disney world  for a couple hours.  Oh, yes. You could say we checked it out. (Laughter)  There are a number of Native abstract artists. Are there any whose style  you particularly admire, or approach?  Well, a lot of people say that my stuff resembles T. C. Cannon   s, you  13  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  know, of the color aspect and sometimes the imagery, but as  contemporary guys now, I   d have to really think because I   m really too  busy doing my own stuff to really look. I do appreciate other art. Don   t  get me wrong. It   s just right now, to say that somebody   s influencing  me, they all do. To try to single out one, it would be kind of wrong. I   m  just trying to think of one offhand that   s just blowing my socks off.  There   s a couple of them right now. Just to name one, I couldn   t do that.  It wouldn   t be fair.  On the other hand, I sometimes think abstract art or semi-abstract art is  kind of a hard sell in Oklahoma. What has your experience been with  being a Native artist and working in this more expressionistic style?  It   s like my dad would always say. He goes,    No matter what you do in  the art world, it will sell. The problem is you   ve got to find that person.     Here in Oklahoma, I   ve never really run into that because people seem  to like what I do, which is great. I   ll say that again: it   s great  (Laughter)  But like I said, it   s one of those things that people are going to   they  like what they like. Again, I   m saying    like my dad would always say     because growing up with a father who was an artist who worked with  some of the greats, he worked with Thomas Hart Benton, worked with  all the Native American greats during the    50s,    60s, and into the    70s.  He   d always say that people are going to buy what they want, and  people buy art because it takes them out of reality. It takes them to a  place that they could be at.  If you   re at an art show, when you   re walking around, listen to when  people say,    I can see myself there,    or,    It speaks to me.    Well, the  reason why it   s speaking to you is because that   s the connection that art  has when you see it. That piece or that sculpture or whatever that thing  is, it   s an attraction. You don   t know what it is. It   s an unwritten one, but  yet you can gravitate towards that to where only you see something in  that to where no one else can. That   s the beauty of it.  I remember the first couple pieces right before I did the Haskell show.  Mom and Dad had a frame shop, and I did a couple of drawings. I  wasn   t too pleased with them, so I crumpled them up, threw them in the  trash. Mom got them and had my brother dry mount them and flatten  them out. I came back, saw them, and they were all framed out nicely.  I   m thinking,    Hell, I just threw those away because I didn   t like them.     She goes,    No, I really like them. I bet you could sell them.    So on a bet,  I went around just cold calling people I didn   t know, and I ended up  selling all twelve of them that same day to one person.  Oh, my goodness.  14  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Mom, she told me, she goes,    I believe in you. I know you can do it.     On those cold calls, were they people that had been in the frame shop?  I   d never met them. I just called places I figured somebody would  want   I called on attorneys. I called on doctors. I called on different  frame shops. (Laughter) Believe me, I was learning at the time, cold  calling is the worst thing anybody could possibly do.  Did you do it by phone or by walking in?  By phone. I wasn   t going to waste gas by driving around. (Laughter) I  called around. I started around eight o   clock that morning, and by six  o   clock that evening I had a check. I had showed Mom, just shaking my  head. I was going,    You were right.    She goes,    Yes, those were nice  pieces. I couldn   t understand why you didn   t   .     So what   s been either a group show or museum show that   s been  particularly significant for you?  Oh, wow. Up until now, it   s probably the one at   golly, that   s kind of  hard because there   s been a couple of them. The one that comes to mind  right off the bat is the one that when my tribe asked me and a couple  other fellow tribal artists if we can depict an event in our tribal history  that changed the course. That happened in Canton. I want to say that was  in    98,    99. Merlin  Little Thunder  was part of that.  Was this  Lawrence  Hart   s Cheyenne Cultural Center  project?  Yes. When was that?  I   m not sure either, but it sounds about right,    99 or so.  It was, yes, about    99, 2000, somewhere around there. That one, to me,  is kind of really at the top.  What did you do for that?  That one, I depicted when the Arapaho first met the white man at the     I   m trying to remember that river. I want to say it was the Minnesota  River or Illinois River. It was 1797 or something like that, somewhere  around there. It was so long ago. I did a painting that depicted when they  first came across white trappers, so that was mine. My brother, I   m  trying to remember what he did. I have a brother, Matt. He also paints.  Not as much anymore, but he did at that time, and so it was kind of nice  to work with not only my brother   .  15  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Did you check in on each other   s canvases periodically?  Oh, no. My brother, he   s a stickler. He   s real finicky. If he   s going to  show it to you, he   s  not  going to show it to you until he   s completely  satisfied and done. (Laughter) I was going to get back to the point about  when I   d sold those pieces. An artist is always his worst critic. He   s his  own worst critic because, like I said, there   ve been pieces to where I just  want to paint over, and yet people love. And the things that I really think  people would go crazy over, they didn   t even give it a second look,  which is wild. (Laughter)  It just kind of blows my mind because I   ve talked to other artists, and  they all seem to say the same thing. Things that they would think would  knock the socks off somebody, nobody even wants them. But the things  that they just discard or   you   d be shocked on how much art has been  thrown away that   s been pulled out of the trash or been salvaged that are  now hanging on the walls of people   s homes all over the place.  (Laughter)  It boils down to is that, like myself, I really don   t want to put something  out there that doesn   t represent me or what I believe in. I think that   s the  majority of the way the other artists feel, also, is they don   t want to put  something out that they can   t stand behind, but there   s always somebody  behind them that goes,    Hey, you need to give that other piece a chance  because you   re not giving it its due.     Now, when you did that commission piece, had you already evolved this  very bright palette?  No, no. This was even still before that. I   d gone through different  changes. At that time, I guess I was going through my impressionist  stage, and I really didn   t get into this. In a way, this was kind of a  throwback to what I did in college but not as defined. When I was in  college, my professor, Norman Gee, he kept saying,    You really need to  look at Edgar Heap of Birds.    He   d gone to KU.    He   s from your same  tribe.    I looked at Edgar   s stuff, and I   m like,    Well, it   s not the  direction I want to go, but I   ll look at some of that stuff.    (Laughs) Then  he goes,    Your color palette, I really love it.    Then he started naming off  some other artists. He mentioned Fritz Scholder and T. C. Cannon, and I  just kind of fell in love with those colors.  You went and looked at the work.  Looked at them, but it was kind of like a sample. I didn   t really jump  into it. I think I was just too nervous or something. At the time, I just  16  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  wanted to do traditional work where when you see it, that   s what it is:  reputational-type stuff. Then I think one of the major changes in me was  once my mother passed away. That really just   in a way, I kind of said,     Fuck it,    and just wanted to let go of stuff. It wasn   t that my mom held  me under her reign or anything. It   s just that I looked up to her. I  admired her so much that I wanted her to see how successful one of her  sons had become.  Once that happened, like again, I lost myself for a few years. It got to a  point to where I   during my painting, I really liked going into the studio  and just slapping paint on. It got to a point to where I started looking at  it. I was like,    That stuff is kind of cool.    I started to kind of lose myself.  I lost myself in my art to where I started finding myself again and started  developing the style that I do now. It   s like any artist or any musician or  anybody who deals in the arts. You   re going to sample from other artists  who   ve come before you, and you   re just going to build on that.  Hopefully, I   ve been doing that.  Did you show at all or travel at all with Matt during the period that he  was actively painting?  Matt, he only did it for like four or five years. He got to a point to where  he kind of got burned out on it. He just kind of goes,    I   m just going to  paint for myself.    Even now, I have people who are going,    Where   s  your brother   s work? I   d like to see what he   s doing now.    There   s just  sometimes where   like he even said,    I can   t do it. This is not what I  wanted to do.    He went to school, also, at Kansas and got a BFA in Fine  Arts, but yet he just   people are just built differently, and he   s just not  built the way I am or some of the other people that paint.  I always am really moved when I see buffalo images in your work, and I  had no idea that you sometimes use that. That   s your email address. I  don   t know about your signature, too, or whether you   re using your  Indian name. Can you talk about buffalo when you do them? I don   t  know. They   re just very     When I do a buffalo   it   s like Mom always asked me,    Why don   t you  paint a white buffalo? Why don   t you paint a white buffalo?    I go,     Well, I really don   t want to.    There   s things that even I censor myself  on, things I   ll do and won   t do. That   s one of them. It   s not because it   s  sacred or this or that. It   s just it   s been done so many times that all I   m  doing is just doing something that somebody else has already done. By  not doing one, I think, goes against the grain.  But with buffalos, I just like doing them. With them, I like to get as  much color and just kind of go wild and everything when I do them.  17  Little Thunder  Learned  Like I said, there   s just something about a buffalo I like painting.  Yes, you can feel that connection. You were asked to curate one of the  Winter Camp shows at the Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.  What was that like, being curator?  Well, to be honest with you, it was   they had already had everything  lined up, so it wasn   t like I came in and did anything new. Again, it goes  back to politics. There   s just certain things about art that I would like to  try here in the future to do, to try to change the things I see. One of them  is this kind of buddy-buddy-type system. If somebody   s been around for  a while, throw them a bone type of thing.  I   m like,    No.    I like to look at young, emerging artists. I like to see  young stuff out there, young talent, things that you just don   t normally  see. If somebody   s been around more than fifteen years, like myself,  they shouldn   t have to be thrown a bone to be put in a show. They  should already have their own show and genre.  That was one thing about the Winter Camp that bothered me about it.  The way it started is I   d met a gentleman who worked at the Cowboy  Hall  of Fame , invited him over to this house party that all these guys  were showing their artwork in. Long story short, I just mentioned it to  him, I go,    Why don   t you have       he was impressed. He was like,     You   ve got some of the top-notch Native American artists all here. It   d  be kind of nice to have something like that somewhere else.     I said,    Well, you   re part of the Cowboy Hall. Why don   t you have it  over there?    He went back, talked to them. He said,    You know what?  We could have that there. I said,    Well, these are the people you need to  talk to,    and I told him the people who invited me to their house for this  show. So that very first show, they threw it. They   d asked me if I wanted  to be a part of the first team of curators or people who select artists and  everything. I said,    As long as I   m in it, hey, you can pick whoever the  hell you want. It doesn   t matter to me.    I noticed that when they picked,  the majority of those people that were at that first show at the person   s  house were not at that second show. There was a bunch of new faces and  buddies of buddies there. I   m thinking,    Wait a second. This is not what  was sold to me.     By the time the second one came around, they   d had one of the people  that were initially on it, kicked him off, basically. They brought me on  board kind of as a token. I   ll be honest. It was a token type of deal.  There   s some things that you   re proud of and you wished you   d stand up  for, and at the time, I went silent. But as I   ve gotten older, I don   t pull  any punches. I   m just going to tell how it is, and if you like it, fine. If  18  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  you don   t, well, fine there, too. Again, the one thing that really bugs me  about Indian artists is some of the politics that go on. It really is. It   s just  sad, and it   s sad that we continue to beat ourselves down. When is  enough enough?  I saw that you had worked with Dale Chihuly on the Eleanor Blake  Kirkpatrick Tower. How did that come about?  The way that came about was I   d been contracted by the Oklahoma City  Art Museum to move some of the artwork because I knew some of the  people that worked there. I said,    Hey, if you ever need help moving that  stuff, let me know,    so they contacted me. My brother, Matt, and I both  went. We helped them move the work from the fairgrounds over to the  new place downtown.  As we were there, they said,    Oh, Dale Chihuly and his guys are here.     It was almost like they were saying,    The plague is here,    or,     Something bad is going to happen.    (Laughter) People actually work in  there.    What is it?    They   re like,    Oh, this guy, his teams, they   re a  bunch of a-holes. They demand so much, and they act like rock stars.     I   m like,    What   s the big deal?     Well, they   d asked the museum if they could provide two people to help  them, so they asked my brother and I, and we said,    Yes, we   ll help you  guys. All we   re doing is hanging paintings over here. It   s not like this is  brain surgery. Yes, we   ll help you.    We end up helping these guys, and  they were the coolest guys. They made it a pleasure working there.  He   s brilliant.  They were fun. I worked with John London, who was the head of  Chihuly   s installment team, got to know him really well. And when Dale  came in   Dale didn   t actually work on the piece. He did all this  fabrication at his studio up in Seattle, but when he came in after we got  finished with the installment, he got to talk to my brother and I. He told  us what influenced him, which was Pendleton blankets. He said it really  influenced him. Native American art really influenced him. That   s when  he actually would blow and do his own work. He goes,    It was nice. I  feel really proud to know that I actually had two Indians work on my  work here.    My brother and I, we were really privileged to work with  the team and everything else. He even offered an invitation to go back  and work up in Seattle for him as apprentices.  Oh, wow   We just told him,    It   d be nice, but I   d like to do my own work. I   ve got  19  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  my own stuff I want to do.    But it was a pleasure working with some  other artist on his work and knowing that, at the time, it was the world   s  largest of whatever it was. At the time, it was the largest glass sculpture.  Okay, yes, just to review, they were sort of researching the site, etcetera,  for the sculpture.  Yes.  That   s very cool. You   ve had a booth at Santa Fe Indian Market for  several years now. What   s one of the highlights of Indian Market for  you?  Oh, just the fun, going out there, the atmosphere, seeing people that you  haven   t seen in a while, just everything about it. It   s like a homecoming.  You   re seeing old friends. You   re seeing customers and patrons and  places to eat. Everything about it, it   s just a fun time.  Does that Oklahoma paradox happen there to you, where you have  people traveling from Oklahoma to Santa Fe to buy your work?  Oh, yes. (Laughter) Yes, I   ll give you a quick story. A few years ago, I   d  talked to this gentleman who   d bought a piece from me. He goes,    If you  ever have a wolf painting, let me know.    I said,    Okay,    because he had  commissioned me to do a pretty-good-sized wolf painting. I did a series  of wolf paintings, and I had a big one. I called him up, and I said,    Hey,  I think it   s probably one of the best ones I   ve done.    He said,    Bring it  over.     Took it over to his house. He looked at it, and he goes,    Yes, I   ll take it.     I   m figuring,    Okay, you   re going to write a check, and I   ll leave.    He  goes,    Oh, no. I   m going to buy it from you out in Santa Fe.    (Laughter)  I go,    Well, okay. You got it right here. I can hang it up.       No, take it  out to Santa Fe.    I said,    All right,    so I took it out there a couple  months later. Saw him. He brought over his friend that he   d gone to  school with. They were standing around there, smoking their cigar. Next  thing you know, he goes,    Hey, I   ll take that painting.    He made a big  production about it in front of his friend.    All right.    Then he tells me, if   I  can, can I to bring it back because he didn   t have room because he  just flew out there. I was thinking,    Well, yes. I can do that for you.     (Laughter)  When you tell people those stories, they   re so funny and so comical, but  yet those happen. You get a lot of people who   ll go out, buy from you.  This guy lived down the street from me, but yet he wanted to buy it  because he could hang it on the wall and say,    Hey, I bought this from a  20  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  guy from Santa Fe.    It sounds more appealing than,    Hey, I bought it  from the guy down the street.    (Laughter) It   s the truth. There   s quite a  few.  Not only that, but it   s just fun running into people from Oklahoma.  There   s quite a few people that come around going,    Oh, you   re from  Oklahoma. It   s nice to see   .    I said,    Oklahoma   s still free. You can go  back at any time. You don   t have to stay here and meet everyone from  Oklahoma. You can actually go back if you   d like.    (Laughter) It   s just  weird. Like I said, being from Oklahoma and from a Oklahoma family,  it   s just kind of cool to see a lot of people surprised when they run into  another Oklahoman.  That   s a great story. You had an exhibit at the capitol in 2011, titled Life  Before Statehood. Is that correct?  No, it was this past year. It was 2012.  Oh, 2012, okay.  Correction. Correction. (Laughs)  Thank you. (Laughter) First of all, I   m really intrigued by the title, Life  Before Statehood. How many paintings did you have, and talk about  your theme a bit.  Oh, man. I want to say I had twenty-five pieces displayed, but I had  taken thirty-five pieces up, I want to say. There were some of them that  they just didn   t want to show.  Really?  Yes, believe it or not. Censorship, censorship. (Laughs) No, there was.  They   d contacted me and said they   d like to do a show, and I said,     Okay.    They said,    Do whatever theme. We   ll do whatever you want.     I asked them, I said,    Well, what   ve other artists done in the past?        Well, they   ve done portraits. Usually, they really don   t have a certain  theme. They might have a cool title, but not a certain theme.     I like to tell stories, not all the time, with my work, but with this, I  wanted to tell a story. As a little kid when we   d go up to the state capitol  for school tours and stuff, you   d look around, and one thing that always  stuck in my mind (and it goes back to what I was saying earlier about  sitting with Mom and Dad on a Sunday afternoon watching cowboy and  Indian movies, old westerns) was that the Indians were always losing.  They were always losing.  21  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  After they contacted me and said,    Hey, we   d like for you to do a show,     I   d gone up there and just kind of walked around. It struck me that  everything they have up there is opposite of what I believe in. For one,  they have a couple of paintings that depict Indians signing something,  always signing something away, giving away something.  The other thing was, I   m under the rotunda looking up, and I see all  these corporations and donors who had donated to the state. Where are  the other people, the other nameless people who   ve paid taxes and have  lived here and died? Where are their names?  So I wanted to do a series of paintings that depict what life was before  statehood, even battles. I depicted a scene of what I would think  happened at the Battle of the Washita, where a cavalry soldier is on his  horse with a saber, coming down on a woman whose son had just died.  See, they thought that was too violent. Then again, I did a piece called  Counting Coup, where an Indian is touching another Indian with his  spear. They thought that was too violent.  They, in essence, censored what I wanted to pick. It was a good show,  don   t get me wrong, and I   m proud to have done it, but I really wish  there was these other pieces that were shown because from my  understanding when I did the show, they had the biggest response from  people. People actually thought it was a permanent display up there.  From that, the state got a piece from me which is now on permanent  display up at the state capitol.  They commissioned a piece?  Yes, but it would   ve been nice to let other people see some of these  other scenes that I had depicted that were never shown. Again, it   s just  one of those things. When is enough enough?  I think we   ve addressed how your style has kind of changed. You talked  about that moment when your palette changed and your subject matter  sort of changed. How about media, besides what you have mentioned?  Have you ever tried any three-dimensional?  Yes, I   ve done some sculpting work in the past, pottery. As an artist and  as somebody who is adventurous, I   ve tried a little bit of everything just  to see if I was capable of doing it, and there was some stuff I realized,    I  just can   t do it.    That   s the reason why I don   t do it. (Laughter)  But your preference is now acrylic on canvas?  22  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  It   s acrylic on canvas.  Are you at all interested in what they call concept art     What   s concept art?     which would be more installation-type things or     Like political art?  Yes.  I   ve talked to a few artists, and I   ve given them concepts about shows.  The response I   ve heard is that,    You don   t want to travel down there.  You don   t want to be another Edgar Heap of Birds,    or,    You don   t want  to be another       I   m trying to think. What   s the other political artist? I  can   t remember. I just know Edgar right off the bat. They said,    You  don   t want to be like that because the people who like your stuff are  going to tend to move away from that.    I got to get to a point to where  I   m comfortable enough to do something like that. Eventually, I will.  Eventually, I will. It   s just, what   s a good way of doing it?  Like I said, I   ve tried my hand at it with my own show up at the state  capitol, and I realized what happened. It got censored from that because  when you go up there, the majority of stuff that you see is just what they  want you see. History is written by the conquered, not by the conquee.  It   s like one time   well, going back, when I went down for the  centennial, I was down there, and I talked to the governor. I admit, I had  a little few many drinks at the time. We were sitting there. He came  over, and he wanted to thank us for representing the state of Oklahoma  and everything else. By that time, I was on a break, so it didn   t   .  (Laughs) I was on break, so the other lady that I was down there with,  who was showing, we went and had a few drinks, and we were talking.  For one, we were talking because some of the questions we heard were  just, they were just downright laughable.    Where are you from?       I  didn   t know Oklahoma was a country,    and all that. I   m like,    Just  because we   re between Morocco and Paris does not make us a country,     or France or whatnot. We were talking, and we came back, and the  governor was there. I walk over, and I shook his hand, said,    Thanks for  this opportunity. I voted for you. I think you   re doing one hell of a job,  but I think there   s a lot more you could do.    He responded,    Well, what  is there more to do?    I said,    Well, let me ask you a question. If you  were a visitor to our state, where would you send them if I wanted to see  something about Native Americans? Don   t tell me about the sculpture  23  on top of the capitol. Send me to a place where I can learn about Indians  who are from Oklahoma.     He responded,    Well, you know what? I really don   t know.    I said,     You know what? Everyone I pretty much ask has that same response.  Their first response is,    Well, we have an Indian on the capitol,    before I  can even say,    Don   t tell me about that. Send me to a place I can learn  about Indians.    You really can   t because there   s really not too many  places.     He goes,    We   re building a cultural center.    I said,    No, from what I  understand it   s a visitors center. I could sit at home and learn more about  the state of Oklahoma than me coming here and going to that museum.  No offense, but it   s just a waste of time and money. You really couldn   t  send me to a place, could you?    He goes,    No.    I said,    Well, I could,  only because I   m from there and my tribe is from there. I could send you  out to southwest Oklahoma, Cheyenne, over by Battle of Washita.  That   s a hell of an educational place. You can learn a lot about that.    He  just kind of shook it off, but I said,    I still respect you. I think you   ve  done well for the state.    Also said,    I   m not just blowing smoke up your  ass. I really like you.    My girlfriend was standing there, and she goes,     Yes, he doesn   t really say that too often, but if he   s saying that, he  really likes you.    (Laughter)  His security guy came over, and he had a big laugh about that. He even  agreed with me. He goes,    You   re right. There isn   t.    The Governor also  said,    Well, do you know how many other caucuses come to me and ask  me? I have the black caucus, the Asian caucus and them, all ask me  for       I go,    But, yes, the Indians were there first. Why aren   t they  represented? I   m not going to bug you with that. You   ve got your own  problems, but it was nice meeting you.    His security guy goes,    You   re  right. I never really thought about that. When you asked him that  question, I was off to the side thinking about,    What would I say to  somebody?        I said,    Well, yes. Dude, if you go to our own state capitol and you look,  there   s always a painting or a description of them signing something  away. It   s always the history they want you to see.    Oh, they   re good  little Indians. That   s in the past. Now here   s the future. We   re big oil.        Oklahomans really grasp to The Grapes of Wrath, that they came from  dirt and nothing and    we made something.    The other part of the before-statehood  stuff, hell, they fucked up. They messed up. They had their  chance, type of thing.  Like I said, there are things that I   d like to do, but you   ve got to have a  good tact about it because you don   t want to step on too many toes,  24  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  especially with the way art operates here in Oklahoma. If you   re  stepping on one toe, you   re stepping on four or five other toes. It   s just  sad to know that there   s so much great art from Oklahoma and so many  people wanting to tell so many different stories, but yet they tie their  own hands because they don   t want to basically piss off anybody.  When you are getting ready to do a project, what is your creative  process?  Well, for example, with this piece behind me, that   s going to the  Bartlesville Mozart Music Festival. It   s going to be next year   s poster.  Still working on it. It   ll be done here in the next few weeks.  That   s wonderful.  I   m usually kind of   I usually give myself a theme. Not only that, but I  want to give myself something I can get somebody that   s going to look  at my work to think about. Sometimes you don   t even have to think  about it, but I   d really like them to think about what they   re really  looking at, not just the bright colors and everything but the overall  hidden punch behind it. With this, they   d asked me, Mozart Music  Festival. I   m thinking to myself,    Okay, well, Plains Indians, drums,  flute, singing, and how can I bring that up to date?    Well, with the  contemporary dancing and the traditional dance and the fancy dancers.  I just kind of combined the old element with the new, and it   s called The  Rhythm of Life because everything has a rhythm. Like I said, it goes  back to what my mom and dad always would say: You got to know  where you come from to know where you   re going. That cycle is always  there. No matter if you don   t like it or not, it   s going to be there.  (Laughter)  How important is preliminary sketching to your work?  It   s just a basic, kind of a little guideline to go,    Here, this is what it   s  going to look like,    but over a course of a painting, it might change three  or four times. Even when I   m done, I   ll look at it a few years later going,     Man, I wish I could go back on that and paint it a little different.     (Laughter) The preliminary sketching is just a guideline to keep me in  bounds on what it   s going to kind of look like in the beginning.  Do you keep a notebook of ideas or sketches?  They   re all up here. (Gestures) They   re all up there because being  dyslexic, it   d be all misspelled and everything else, so why even bother  writing it down? (Laughter)  25  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  What kinds of research do you do for your paintings?  I do a lot of Internet research, look through books, talk to people, and, if  I can, try to actually see some of the type of regalia, first-hand, to kind  of get an idea of some of the texture and some of the color schemes.  There   s a lot because like my father, he would say is that,    Artists, no  matter what you   re doing, if you   re going to paint people, especially  Indians, Native Americans, Plains Indians, whatnot, you want to be  historically correct. You   re a historian of that time.    And you   re going to  say,    Well, you paint in bright colors. How are you getting all that  stuff?    Well, what I   m doing is I   m taking the overall symbol of the  Plains Indian, jazzing him up by using these different colors but yet still  keeping that undertone theme of what it was like for that person.  It   s like we were at   oh, where were we? I went with my father to  Loveland, Colorado, to a show up there because he was a sculptor. They  had a sculpture of Little Raven, and my dad and I looked at that going,     It looks nothing like Little Raven.    The lady goes,    Why is that? I   m  the artist.    We   re like,    Well, that   s fine, but we   re distant relatives of  Little Raven, and Little Raven never wore that type of regalia. Those are  not his colors. In the position and what you had him doing,    (she had  him sitting there, holding a gourd, pouring water out of it because it was  a water fountain piece)    he would   ve never done anything like that.  They way you had his hair and everything is totally wrong.     When you   re depicting somebody of historical value, you don   t diminish  him. You don   t see me painting a handlebar mustache on Abraham  Lincoln. I understand there is artistic license, but when you   re depicting  this person as historically correct, no, it   s not.  We had told the director of the show what this lady had done, and he   d  even asked her, going,    Did you do any research? Do you know? These  people are saying they   re related to him.    She basically admitted,    No, I  didn   t.    So he literally had her put a blanket over the piece     Wow      and said,    You   re not to sell that, not to show it to anybody.    That  was nice. It was nice to know that somebody had some integrity. When  you paint, you   re basically a historian of your time, of your generation,  no matter if it   s political or satire or whatnot. You   re telling your story,  and you want to tell it the way you want to tell it.  How do you feel about   well, what   s your creative routine, first? Are  there a certain number of days that you work? You also work with this  26  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  co-op gallery, so let   s talk about both things, maybe. What is your  involvement with the co-op gallery?  Oh, with the co-op gallery, it just gives me time to paint bigger pieces.  Right now, I   m in the process of building a studio.  For space.  Bigger space, plus it   s fun. It   s always nice to come up here and look at  the different works from the different artists because, like I said, it kind  of reminds me of when I was in college, having a college studio. When  you go in there, you smell the paint, you get that feel, and to look around  and seeing what other people are doing, it   s almost like getting ready for  a critique or something. It kind of gets the blood going again, so it   s  been kind of nice being up here.  And then they show your work, and you also put in some hours helping  everybody else?  Oh, no. I just come up here to paint when they need somebody to come  up.  Oh, okay. So you don   t watch the gallery for them at all?  No, I   ll watch it for them the days that somebody can   t work. I   ll come  in     I see. I got you.     but when I   m up here, I   m painting.  Have you ever inadvertently had to make a sale because   . (Laughter)  I   ve had a few people who have ended up walking out with one of my  pieces. (Laughter) It   s not that I was pushing on them, but I just showed  them what I   ve done. Yet, when you walk in and you see an artist  painting, it   s like inviting to where you just want to see it, and to see him  finish it up and you saw the process of what he did from somewhat  beginning to end, it just feels like,    Hey, I   m a part of that.    You want to  take it with you. But I   ve had a few incidences where they left with one  of mine. (Laughter)  Some of the tribes are really pushing their tribal artists right now. I  don   t know if you have any comments on that. Do you think the C and As   Cheyenne Arapahos  are moving forward in terms of promoting their  artists?  27  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  No, they   re so caught up with the inner struggle of who   s the Governor  this week that they don   t have time for that. As for these other tribes  pushing their artists, that   s fine. It   s fine. The deal is, the majority of  those tribes that you   re referring to, hate to say it, but they paint Plains  Indians and they   re not Plains Indians. They   re really not.  That   s the other thing. I was talking to a few artists when I was out in  Santa Fe, and we were talking. They   re Plains Indians like myself.  They   re Comanche, Kiowa. I   m not going to give you all the ins and  outs, but we were sitting around talking, and they noticed that a lot of  these other tribes depict our tribes and try to pass it off on themselves.  They asked me,    What do you think about that?    I said,    Well, that   s  fine. It   s promotion of us, but the problem is we   ve got to let people  know that   s who we are.    When people come up and tell me that they   re  Indian, I ask them,    What is your tribe? Where are they from? What do  they do?    The majority of them really don   t know.  It goes back to when I went to Florida. I had this old guy   he had to be  about, I   d say seventy, seventy-five, if that. I was shocked. He asked me,  he goes,    So you   re Indian.    I said,    Yes.    He goes,    Well, what tribe?     I go,    I   m Cheyenne Arapaho.    He goes,    I   ve never heard of them. I   m  Florida Seminole.    He was a white guy, but he   d only heard of Florida  Seminole. These other tribes never    So I said,    Did you even have a  TV growing up? Did you go to movies?    (Laughter) There   s a lot of  other tribes other than the Florida     Cheyenne Autumn. (Laughter)  Yes. He goes,    No. Where are they from?    I said,    Well, they   re Plains  Indians. They   re nomadic, so they travel around, but right now we have  a headquarters out in Concho, Oklahoma. The Indians were out there.     I   m not kidding you, this guy had literally   I don   t think he ever left the  city or the state of Florida. You   d be shocked on how many people I   ve  ever met in my life who actually think that way, that their Indians are the  only Indians that ever existed. If I had a dollar for every time I heard,     I   m Cherokee, and my grandmother was an Indian princess       I mean,  that lady got around. (Laughter) She got around a lot, and everyone   s  related to her.  It   s kind of been a tough market since the crash, I guess. I   m wondering  about the strategies that you   ve developed for adapting.  The way I   ve adapted is that I   ve gone miniature, gone smaller pieces,  things that are affordable because, with me, I only do one-of-a-kind  originals. I don   t do prints. I don   t do photographs of the work and  28  reproduce it or any of that. The only time I ever do posters, if I   m doing  it for a cause that I believe in. Like I did one for the Oklahoma Health  Sciences Center of child abuse  Center on Child Abuse and Neglect .  Did their posters. I   ve done one for literacy, done one for American  Indian Diabetes, things I believe in, things I   d like to put my brand on.  As far as changing with the times and changing with the economical  situation we have now, I   ve just done a lot of little smaller pieces, little  sketches, little things that are affordable.  I   ll give you this story. I was with my brother. It was the first time I ever  went out to Arizona. Like I say, I do a lot of Plains Indians stuff. Well,  we did this show out in Litchfield Park, and this lady walked by. She  was pushing her cart. At the time, I did a lot of charcoal and pencil  drawings. I was just starting out. She walked by a couple times, pushing  her cart, and she   d look. One time she came back, and she sat there and  just kept looking. I said,    Ma   am, is there anything I can help you  with?    She goes,    No, sir. I was just admiring your work. You do  beautiful work. That piece right there reminds me of what I used to look  like,    and she broke down and started crying. I turned around, took it  off, handed it to her, stuck it in her cart. She goes,    What are you  doing?    I said,    Well, it   s yours now.    She goes,    Oh, I don   t have any  money to pay you or anything.    I said,    No, your words were payment  enough. It   s yours. What you said let me know that I   m on the right  track.     So she left. She came back about, oh, I   d say about an hour later, and she  was trying to write me a check. She gave my brother and I a can of Coke  and a bowl of chili. Soon as she left, we went to that bank, cashed that  check. No, I   m just kidding  (Laughter) No, but she tried to write me a  check, and I just told her, I said,    No, ma   am. Your words were payment  enough.    She goes,    Okay.     Then there was an artist that was there at the very end. His name was  Cliff Beck. He came over to me, and he goes,    I saw what you did. I like  that. Come over and sit down with me.    So I sit down with him. He said,     I really like your work. How old are you?    We got to talking, and by  the end of the conversation I traded him a small   for one of his pieces, I  gave him one of my pieces. It was a pretty-good-sized piece at the time.  I talked to him off and on for the next year and a half, and he later  passed away. His wife told me,    He only had one other artist that he  hung in his studio. That was your piece. I don   t know what you did, but  he always thought highly of you.    He always asked if I   d called or  whatnot. They even wanted me to be a pallbearer at his funeral. I   d only  known him for at least a year and a half, but he was a hell of a guy. Like  I said, he was one of the first big-time artists that I   d ever met when I  29  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  started out.  Yes, very good artist, and what a compliment. When you look back on  your career so far, what do you think has been a kind of fork-in-the-road  moment for you where you could   ve maybe gone a different direction but  you went     That was right when my mom passed away. I should   ve been more  productive. Again, I was young, better looking than I am now, if you can  believe that, (Laughter) and just chasing the wrong roads at the time.  When my mom passed away, it just kind of killed my creativity and  drive and everything. I was lost for a few years before I finally woke up.  When I did, I just said,    Screw it. I   m just going to plug at it.     What has been one of the highlights of your career so far?  Oh, man. I   m trying to think. Well, I   d have to say doing a piece for  Gale Sayers because, like I say, I   m a big KU fan, love KU football,  which lately hasn   t been loving me very well. (Laughter) Doing a piece  for somebody that, growing up, you watched on TV, NFL films, and all  that other stuff, then flying up to Chicago and meeting in person and  handing him a piece that you did that he   s going to hang in his home.  I   ve done paintings for other celebrities and everything, but out of like a  big thing, that was probably the coolest.  That   s very cool. Now, did KU   who sponsored that?  The Kansas alumni had purchased a piece from me to give to him. That  was cool. They wanted to do something special for him because he went  to school there, he   d taught there. He   d done so much for the university  that they wanted to give him a thank you, so they had contacted me. The  other thing, like I said, it was a highlight. There   s so many of them.  That   s one that really sticks out.  Another one was I did a piece for the alumni magazine of Chester Nez,  who was the last Native American code talker. He was on the cover. I  did the piece that sat on the cover of the magazine, and he   d gone to KU.  He   d also gone to Haskell.  Now that I   m thinking about it, the biggest thing was probably right  when I first started out. I did a piece for the Smithsonian Institute. It was  a portrait of my mother when she was a little girl. That was by far the  biggest, right off the bat. That was pretty big.  They had been in touch with you. Did you take that piece out? Did they  buy the painting from you? I   m just wondering how that worked.  30  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  The way it worked out was when my mother was a chairperson, she  introduced me to Rick West, Jr. She had said,    He   s the head of the  Smithsonian Indian wing that they   re eventually going to build,     because at that time it was just still a thought, I guess. When she retired  as a chairperson, we had ran into him at some Cowboy Hall of Fame  function. I think I donated a piece or something, and he was there. She  goes,    Well, I   ll talk to him again, re-introduce you.    He came up, and  he goes,    I   ve seen some of your work. I like it. Let me know when you  got a piece that you feel is good, and we   ll take a look at it.    I said,    All  right.     Mom came down sick, and I called him and let him know. I said,    Hey, I  did a portrait of my mom when she was a little girl, and I think right now  it   s probably one of my best pieces.    He said,    Well, when you come up  to DC we   ll look at it.    Went up to DC. They looked at it, and they said,     We   d like to have that.    At the time, they didn   t buy it. It was a  donation from my mom.  I came back. I had to get it appraised. There   s so many freaking loop  holes you had to jump through. It was like, well, it was about a two-year  process. It went to New York because they accepted it. Then Mom,  again, came down sick, and she didn   t have too much longer, so I had  them send the painting back. It hung in her room, and when she passed  away, we had it boxed up and shipped it back to New York. But prior to  it being shipped, Mom wrote in her own handwriting what the painting  depicted, so that   s with the painting. They ended up getting that from  me, and that was a pretty big honor.  Is there anything you   d like to add before we take a look at your work,  or anything we forgot to talk about?  No, I can   t really think of anything. We   ve pretty much kind of hit it all.  Really, I just can   t think of anything right now.  Well, let   s take a look at your painting, here. Okay, this is the  Bartlesville piece, Rhythm of Life. You sort of talked about it a little bit,  but anything else you   d like to address?  Oh, I was just going to come back. The way I paint is that I   ll sketch it  out so I   ve got a preliminary of where things are going to kind of go, and  as the course of painting it, it evolves and changes. What I was going to  come back and do was come back and do some detail on the faces, start  to bring out the characteristics in the face. These guys are playing  drums. The guy in the middle is singing. Then off in the back is modern  day. You   ve got the fancy dancers. You   ve got the shawl dance going  31  Little Thunder  Learned  Little Thunder  Learned  on over here. But in the foreground you   ve got the past meeting the  present. It   s a rhythm of color, just a lot of explosion going on.  Right. That   s going to be wonderful. Your signature, I didn   t get to ask  you how you evolved that.  My signature goes back to my mom. She goes,    When you sign your  work you should sign it with your Indian name.    The way I had gotten  my Indian name was we   d gone up to my Aunt Imogene. We went out to  Canton, Mom and I. Imogene, she asked me, she goes,    What do you  do?    I said,    Well, I paint and draw and stuff.    She said,    I know, but  what are the things that you like to paint or whatnot?    I said,    I really  like buffalo. I really love Mom   s maiden name, which was Howling  Buffalo.     So, what she did is she did a play on words, and she called me Buffalo  Bull Howling. And so Mom said,    When you sign your work, you  should put your Indian name. I want you to sign Arapaho.    I go,    Why is  that?    She goes,    Well, because there   s tons of Cheyenne artists. I am  both Cheyenne and Arapaho with some Sioux.    She goes,    I want you to  sign in Arapaho because there   s not too many Arapahos that paint. They  should be proud of having an artist, also.    So out of respect for my mom,  I sign it with Arapaho, and that   s the story on my signature. I sign it  Buffalo Bull Howling, but I sign it in Cheyenne, which is Haa Naa Jaa  Ne-Doa and in Arapaho and then the year that I did the piece.  That   s great. Well, thank you so much for your time today, Brent.  Oh, you   re welcome. If you have any other questions, just feel free to  ask.  -------  -------
