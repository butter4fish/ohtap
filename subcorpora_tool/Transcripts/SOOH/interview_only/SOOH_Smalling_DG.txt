 Little Thunder  Smalling  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, February 5,  and I   m interviewing D. G. Smalling for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We   re at the  Oklahoma  judicial building  at the State Capitol, where D. G. has an office. D. G., in addition to your  many other accomplishments, you   re an artist who works in multiple  media, perhaps best known for your technique of single-line drawing.  You   ve had an international upbringing, but you   re very much  connected to your Choctaw roots, which are a major influence on your  art. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Pleasure.  Can you talk a bit about where you were born and some of the places  you lived as a child?  (Laughter) Well, my parents were in seminary in grad school in Texas in  Waxahachie, Texas, when I was born. They had the sensibility at three  months to bring me back to Oklahoma, so came back to Oklahoma. My  family, being Choctaw   well, my family   s split because on my father   s  side he   s Dutch, or Frisian, actually, (that   s where my last name comes  from) and he   s also Comanche. His grandmother was one of Quanah   s  children, and you know how that is. (Laughter) There are a heck of a lot  of us Parkers, man. There are a lot of Parkers, which is kind of cool, too.  Being in the Oklahoma Judicial Center, he was not only the last war  chief of the Comanches but he was the first tribal judge, so we actually  have several of his portraits here. It   s really cool to see him here. I  digress, there.  We went back to southeast Oklahoma at Haworth. We always had a  house around Idabel, but my parents were pastors. From Waxahachie,  we went to Blanchard. From Blanchard, we went back to southeast  5  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Oklahoma to Haworth. From Haworth, we went to Lausanne,  Switzerland. My parents became missionaries, and they worked sort of  like NGO  non-governmental organization  work, or non-governmental  humanitarian stuff, but they were very much missionaries. I went to  Switzerland, Lausanne for language school. I went to the  Commonwealth American School in Lausanne.  So are we talking middle school?  No, it was elementary. Went to Cameroon, Central Africa, to Douala,  which was the major economic city, port city of the country of  Cameroon. Then from Douala, I went to Yaounde. In Douala, I went to  the International American School. Then when I went to Yaounde,  which is the political capitol further in the interior of the country, I went  to the American International School there. I went to Johannesburg,  South Africa. There I was ending junior high, going into high school,  that transition, so I went to South African Government Public School in  Johannesburg, Sandown High.  That was at the tail-end of apartheid. That was weird because there  wasn   t a racial classification for me. My dad arrived, and you don   t  really see much of the Comanche in him. You see very much the Frisian  in him and,    Oh, cool, we got another Dutch baby.    I arrived, and they  were like,    What the heck?    (Laughter) Then went to University.  Did you come, then, back and forth to Oklahoma? Did you have a  relationship with your grandparents on either side?  Absolutely. We would come back, you know. When I came back, it was  always to southeast Oklahoma, always around just north of Broken Bow.  My clan town is Panki Bok. Panki Bok is   if you can believe something  is east of Broken Bow. (Laughter) About halfway between Broken Bow  and De Queen, Arkansas, is Eagletown. About a couple miles south of  Eagletown is Panki Bok. That   s our major clan town. I also have clan  relations with Honobia. My grandfather moved his family out of Panki  Bok in Eagletown to just north of Broken Bow, or what is Hochatown,  to a place called Bethel. That   s really where most of my family are, all  right in that area.  Do you have other members of your family that were artistically  inclined, or extended family?  On my dad   s side, quite a few. Surprisingly enough, more musicians,  more musicians. My cousin John Moore is from that area originally. He  started playing   he   s bluegrass. He started playing Grand Ole Opry  when he was thirteen with his sister. She was a little bit older. On both  6  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  sides of the family, very musical.  On my mother   s side, which I   m more attached to in terms of my tribal  side, obviously, but I   m neither more attached to either/other, it was  fascinating, the role of the all-night singings at church because my  grandfather taught. When he came back from World War II, he only had  two employers his whole lifetime: the US Army and Choctaw Nation.  (Laughter) So it was kind of funny. There in north Bethel at the church,  which is also the community center which had the school, it was all right  there. They lived a mile from it, and they still do. My grandmother still  does. There was always music.  One of my aunts beaded up until her death, was a very good beader but  didn   t do it enough, unfortunately. There was a lot more. It was strange.  You could tell there was a divide between family members who were  trying to understand what had gone on in displacement and then those  who weren   t interested.  When did you see your first piece of Native art?  I have no idea. My grandfather, more than likely. He kept things on his  desk. That   s probably where it was. I had blankets made for me, so  actually that would have been the first because those were my birth  blankets.  What was your first experience making art?  I don   t know. I mean, it was always around. Drawing something,  painting something, building something, that was always norm. I don   t  know. I know I can tell you when I realized I could do something with  my art, was different. I was in Switzerland. We would listen to the radio  all the time, trying to get something that was in English, so we would  listen on the shortwave. We would get stuff from Voice of America,  Radio Freedom, and other things. There was one station that played  these radio theatre dramas. I was about eight or nine, and they asked to  submit for competition, the kids listening, submit an art piece for  competition. I did. It was being broadcast out of Geneva, and we lived in  Lausanne, which was like forty miles away. So I did. It was the only  time I ever did, and I won, which was kind of cool. I thought,    That   s  interesting. I can do this.     I have to think that for me, what saved me, to think that I really could do  something with the art, was leaving. I think that that was critical because  when I left the United States   it   s absolutely not a slam against my  teachers, my elementary teachers at Haworth. I have only the fondest of  memories. Haworth still to this day holds a very important place in my  7  Little Thunder  Smalling  life because it is quintessentially the safest place I   ve ever lived. But  when I left Haworth and I left the United States and went to Switzerland  and went to a Commonwealth school, (it is an elite school; it would be  false to call it anything else) we had art every day. We had poetry every  day. I was in third or fourth grade and immediately learning how to  memorize Robert Frost, and painting and sculpting. It was incredible. I  think that year was the most pivotal year of my life.  So you   re getting this wonderful background in the arts overseas  already at that junior high/middle school level?  Oh, it was incredible. I can   t really emphasize how radical it was. When  I mean radical, not in a subjective or some sort of idiomatic way but in a  true sense, radical experience because I left southeast Oklahoma the  week before Christmas. My godmother, my paternal aunt and her family,  lived in Bad Homburg in Germany. They were working for IBM. Got on  a plane for the first time. It was a 747 KLM, and they bumped us up first  class. So not only am I experiencing this for the first time, (I   m this  punk-ass kid) I spent the entire time in the cockpit with the pilots.  (Laughter) I   ve always been a very curious person. I love adventure, so  for me, I was having a ball.  We got to Germany, and I remember going to midnight mass for the first  time. It was Christmas Eve, which, that was a first. Everybody, the  community congregated in this medieval fortresses central court with  candlelight, proceeded along this route to the cathedral and went in. First  time in a castle, first time in a cathedral, sitting down, and for the first  time ever, hearing an orchestra in this cathedral, the full Messiah with  choir. Blew my mind. Blew my mind because my experiences of the  castle, of the cathedral, of the music were not tourist. They were  participant-observer. They were seeing each in the proper context and  mind-boggling.  I realized,    Holy crap, what the heck is this? Where have I been?     Hooked me, just hooked me. From then on, I wanted to see the stained  glass windows. I wanted to see the sculptures. I wanted to see the  tapestries. I wanted to hear the music. I wanted to learn how to read the  music. I wanted to get it. For me, the art, it wasn   t a matter of trying to  get me in front of art. I wanted to see the art. I wanted to see the  aesthetic. I wanted to see things, whether it was in Switzerland or  Europe or     Then when we got to Cameroon, the richness of the African art that was  there, the sculpture, which to me is the finest in the world, I don   t think  anyone can sculpt like the Central Africans can sculpt. They can sculpt  anything, I mean, just anything. Their sense of abstraction, it reminds me  8  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  in many ways of, like, Allan Houser   s work, just an innate sense of  space. Allan, talk about audacious. I digress, there.  You   re having all these wonderful art experiences, both in and outside of  school. When did you sell your first piece of art?  Sell it? It was when I was in DC, Washington, DC. I was working for  SAIC at the time, (it   s a defense group) and I needed something to do on  the side.  Were you in your early twenties or     I was in my mid-twenties. My mind was exhausted. I did some paintings  for a psychiatrist, a series of paintings. Seven of them, I think it was. Big  ones. She just wanted some flowers. I did flowers, real simple, basic  stuff. For me, that was fun. I was able to create without any obligation.  Aesthetically, they were good pieces, but they weren   t anything to think  about. They were just fun to do because the sort of stuff I was dealing  with at SAIC on my desk was really macabre, nasty stuff.  Can you tell us what the acronym stands for?   Science Applications  International Corporation. Does that help you  understand what they do?  No. (Laughter)  Precisely  Precisely   So you get an undergraduate degree in political science, and then you  got your master   s in international studies.  I did not finish my master   s. I decided to do art instead.  Okay. At the undergraduate level, did you take any more art?  No, never did. My focus in those years, my focus throughout my  undergrad and grad, was on crisis management. It was on the study on  the crisis and on the management side of issues dealing with terrorism. I  did that with   I actually went to OU because of a person, and I wanted  to study under that particular person who was very much in the United  States the founder of that field, thirty, forty years earlier. I mentored  under him and became his assistant. Then he sent me around and  allowed me access to different places in the world to train and then also  to work. That   s what I did. My world was not art at all. I never even  conceived of myself as doing art as a full-time. It really never even  9  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  factored in.  So you lived in DC for a while, and I think you also lived in  Czechoslovakia.  Never Czech. I lived in Hungary, and then I worked throughout   I   ve  done work in every country of the Balkans.  Does that have an impact on your work today?  Absolutely.  In what way?  When I came back from the Balkans, and when I had decided to do art, I  took a vow to my mother that I would never paint anything dark,  cynical, macabre. I know that too easy. I don   t believe shock art   s even  possible anymore. I don   t see why people even want to play with it. I  think I may do it once. I think it may be more like an installation. If I did  it, my shock art would consist of, like, an empty room, big room, just  when people are pretty much liquored up as they do at these things.  There would be no art on the walls. It would be bare. Then I   d walk out  with some butt-naked little baby, hopefully crying. Not going to make it  cry, but if it chooses to cry, it just helps the moment. Get people   s  attention and look at them and say,    Look what you can never be. You  can never be innocent, so don   t make others catch up with you so  quickly.     In your twenties, already doing these flowers just for fun, are you  already working kind of minimalistically?  In high school and everything else leading up to, I was the exact  opposite. I did strict realism. Strict, rigid, nothing abstract, whatsoever.  Nothing. It was surprising for me. What happened was I went through  some experiences in the Balkans that just necessitated me trying to  communicate with women, particularly women who   we   re talking  clients, or worked with groups that were clients because some of my  clients worked with rape camp victim associations, POWs, and what not.  Someone like me showed up, probably didn   t look and smell the most  savory of individuals at the time, and probably wasn   t, and tried to get  through to them that I wasn   t like other men.  Of course, anyone who has been severely traumatized, especially when  they have been drilled into this Pavlov situation   stimuli/ response  world, they   re chattel. That   s how they think when they come out. Then  10  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  I started drawing flowers because I would randomly start drawing, and I  would hand it to them. Unfortunately, I had to draw a lot, so I had to  draw faster and faster and faster and faster, newspaper, whatever, on  whatever because it was showing   .  It caught me because when I started trying for other subject matter, I  realized how much I had to concentrate. I had internalized proportion. I  had internalized perspective. It   s drilled in me. I was able to work, then,  on very much applying that movement that anyone in art school does,  trying to draw within the line. I inverted the reason for it. Whereas most  people do it to loosen up their hand to help them capture an image, mine  was the opposite. Mine was to exact my hand. The image was already  there. It was to exact it. I was after that minimal movement so it  wouldn   t look like scribble, that it was just an economy of movement.  So are you talking about the single-line work at this point?  Yes, and I began to recognize the more I thought about it, the shit  around me disappeared. I was able to kind of leave for those brief  moments what was going on and who was going on around me. It  became very precious to me. I began to recognize I did not want that  external to filter in. I needed to have a very strict definition of  compartmentalized action.  So when did you begin doing art more full-time?  When I came back. This is about 2002, 2003. Actually it would be, I  think, 2003. A woman who was very much like my grandmother   as a  matter of fact, every day since I was nineteen I just referred to her as my  grandmother: Kay Orr. She was the most important person in my life in  terms of art. She was an artist there at Paseo. Her studio was right next  to Mike Larsen   s when he was there.  In Oklahoma City?  Yes. You had Tom Lee, the photographer, was there. You had Claude  Anderson. All really interesting. Then you had Studio Six with the four  ladies who were just very   Sue Moss Sullivan and  Winnie Hawkins .  When I was nineteen there in university, I would come and hang out and  just work in the studio with her. When I came back, she had just passed  away. She had asked me not to come back to the funeral, and so I came  back to help her son to close up the shop and transition. I did a full  retrospective audit of her work. People, collectors, and whatnot, they  came in with their work, and I organized that. I wanted her grandkids,  and I wanted to have it   I wanted others to have a full sense of the body  of work before it kind of dispersed irrevocably, so I spent a lot time  11  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  there in the studio. I started painting again, and I wanted to do it more,  and so I started.  When I started grad school, I recognized there was such a conflict there.  I went into grad school way too soon after coming back. I should have  waited a few years. My mind was in a very dark place. I had a hell of a  lot of healing to do. When I quit grad school, I didn   t do anything else  but paint. I just painted. I didn   t give myself an option. I just painted,  and painted a lot. I figured that I didn   t want to be like a lot of my  father   s friends or relatives who came back from conflicts and whatnot  and waited until they   re middle aged after they   ve screwed up a few  wives and a few sets of kids. I didn   t want to do that. You know? I  figured,    Let   s get it through now.     So the healing for you was the painting.  Absolutely, and I   m convinced the rigor of keeping that diet and keeping  the strictness of how the art was used, and what I ingested mentally     there was nothing dark. There was nothing cynical. There was nothing  macabre. There was none of that in my life. I wouldn   t allow it. I have  buddies of mine still from those days that are here that knew me there  and know me now. I just figured the discipline that kept me alive would  help me heal.  Did you get involved with galleries when you were going through that  phase, or were you not at that point yet?  I did. I think it was 2006.  What were some of them?  I wanted to get in a gallery that had nothing to do with Indian Country at  all, so the first gallery I ever got into was in Little Havana in Miami. It  was a gallery called the Cremata Gallery. It   s no longer there. They were  a great couple.  How did you find it? (Laughter)  Yes, exactly. I went down to see my middle sister and my now brother-in-  law. She lived in Fort Lauderdale; he lived in Pompano. I   d never  been to Miami. I   d never been there, and I   ve always loved cigars. I had  my first cigar when I was quite young. I   m not going to say it in case my  parents ever read this. (Laughter)  Cross that out.  12  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  No, they know I love my cigars. I   m not going to tell them how early.  First cigar, I knew I liked cigars. I wanted to go to Calle Ocho. I wanted  to go to Little Havana, and I wanted to have a cigar. I wanted to sit down  with a Cuban coffee, and I wanted to bitch at Castro. That   s what I  wanted to do. I wanted to do it for those reasons. I mean, how funny is  that? That   s what I wanted to do. I wanted to go down there and sit  down with the old geezers and say,    I hate him, too.    (Laughter) Just to  say,    I hate him, too. All right, we   re in common here.     So I went down and did that. I was walking by these galleries, and my  youngest sister, she went into this gallery, and she goes,    This is good.  You ought to put your stuff here.    I   m just looking around. She goes,     My brother, he paints. You should see his stuff.    I said,    What?    They  said,    Really? We   d like to see your stuff.    I said,    Whatever.        Seriously, we   d like to see your stuff.    I said,    I have nothing here. I  just came down to see my sister.       Well, how long are you here?       I   m  here, like, two weeks.       Make something. Show us.       Okay.    Went by  an art supply store, bought some paper, bought some ink, and did some  stuff for them. They were like,    We   ll take it.     So they were ink drawings.  Yes, these were all ink. They said,    We   ll take it. You got more?    I said,     I   ll send some.       All right, we   ll take it.     And you   re doing one-line. What was the subject matter?  I think those were all horse and rider, but they weren   t necessarily  Native. At that time at university, though I could not with my time and  constraints get involved with polo, I come from a lot of horse people. I  love polo. I think it   s the most glorious sport after rugby. After rugby. If  I could get to a match, I was at a match. Fortunately, Oklahoma has  wonderful polo teams. Both OU, OSU have phenomenal teams. That  was always a pleasure, so I did stuff that was based on polo. I did some  flowers.  It was a fun little composite of things. It was a lot of fun to do. It gave  me a lot of confidence because I needed the validation that it wasn   t  because I knew anyone. I needed to know that the validation came from  the work being alone on its own, and that it wasn   t because it was Native  and that I was in a Native gallery.  I   ve really shied away from that not because I don   t see a need for it, or  it   s certainly not at all to speak ill of them. It   s just, for me, I want my  artwork to just be because I   m an artist. That I   m Native, that may  inform my subject matter, but it doesn   t define what I do. It   s very  13  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  important, but   .  What   s an early show or exhibition you had that you feel gave you some  important visibility?  The most important show for me, beginning, was my first show, and it  was because I did it at Jacobson House out of respect for the Kiowa Six.  I have the utmost respect for those six artists, for Oscar Jacobson and   Jeanne  d   Ucel, his wife. Was it Sister Margaret or Margaret   who was  the woman from St. Patrick   s who brought them to     That was Susie Peters.  To show in that space was important for me to do because I wanted to be  able to show in that space as a sign of respect but also a validation of the  work.  Was this 2007?  In    06 or    07.  You   ve done a lot of commission portraits     It   s weird, isn   t it?     and fabulous assignments like Tony Blair and Sandra Day O   Connor  and Mrs.  Anna  Houser.  Two for her  O   Connor . I   m about to do my third in June.  That   s wonderful. Are these portraits more realistic, or are they  suggestive?  No. They   re just like this.  What   s hard? What   s the challenge of doing a portrait of a really well-known  person as opposed to somebody who   s not so well known?  There isn   t a difference. There   s absolutely no difference.  Do you work from a photograph to start with?  I don   t want to. I prefer not to.  How about Sandra Day O   Connor   s? How did you approach her  portraits?  14  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  When I was asked   the first one was rather on the spot. Justice   Yvonne  Kauger asked me to. At the time, Chief Judge Robert Henry,  (he was Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit at the time) they asked me to  come to the Governor   s Pavilion to do a portrait of her.  Wow. (Laughs) Pressure.  No, not really. I mean, I had worked through my pressure. I   m pretty  easy around pressure as an artist now. The most pressure as an artist I   ve  ever felt was when I deliberately started out on a project to get me over  that feeling. I did a three-year series on drag queens in which I would go  out to the clubs, to the residences, to be at the club both out in the  audience and then I would go in the back with them. I did that  because   .  And you   re working on site, drawing.  Absolutely. Absolutely. The worst lighting in the world. Worst lighting  in the world. Worst audiences in the world. They   re drunk. People  around you were drunk, high, whatever. They   re moving, dancing. That  was very fortunate that the club owners, number one, and the queens  themselves, number two, wanted this. They were cool with it. They  would set me up a little spot and let me work.  They all knew Kay. It was like a grandmother. They all knew her. All  the club owners knew her, so I had a rapport with them going in, and  they understood that I wasn   t there to be cynical. They understood that I  was approaching them like I would approach a ballerina, like I was  going to approach a Native dancer. I am there to just commit myself to  that moment on the paper. Out of respect, I gave each and every single  person that helped me a piece. That was just a sign of respect.  So you took the project on for, did you say, three months?  Three years, I did it.  Three years. You were mentioning the clubs and the atmosphere. When I  first saw your video, because that one-line drawing technique is very  much a kind of action art, it makes for a great performance. I   m  wondering if you   re aware of the performative element when you do it,  or are you just so focused     I can be if I need to be. That was part of why I did it. I wanted to be able  to become so comfortable with the form and with the method that  literally anywhere at any time with anyone I could do it. That was  15  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  important. I wanted to be free of any sort of   I wanted to know how to  commit to exactly right then and there.  Then I wanted to also   there was a very practical part of it for me, was  dealing with the male form. Up to that point, I   d never drawn a man. I  mean, there was no point, you know? As Kay always said   she was my  grandmother, so as my grandmother always said,    Paint what you  know.    Well, I didn   t care a thing about men, so I never drew any men. I  went about learning how to draw a man through using drag queens, from  transitioning from the female body over to the male.  So you   re talking about some of the backstage stuff, watching the  transformation.  Yes, absolutely, and it gave me stuff that I never would   ve thought of.  When you have a subject, somebody that you   re working with, and  they   re prepping up, and suddenly it looks like it   s right out of Hamlet.  The person is a blank canvas, and it   s that wig, and they   re holding the  mannequin head. It   s, like, right out of Shakespeare, and realizing this  person is projecting an alter ego here.  It was really interesting, too, to be in the room or in the space. I  developed a rapport with these people at a point that for many of them  was extremely vulnerable, that someone like me could quite  comfortable, or I should say, they could be quite comfortable with  someone like me in their room. I did it for many reasons. It seemed like  a very economic way of getting a lot done with one movement or one  process, and it worked.  It really worked because I had just completed it, and then I was asked by  Jonna Kirschner in the Oklahoma Department of Commerce to go with  them. There were several Native artists who went with the Centennial  Celebrations there at the Epcot Center. I went, and nine out of ten of the  pieces they took were these drag queens. I didn   t have anything else.  That   s what I was working on.  How was the reception?  I sold out in three days, and I was there longer than anyone. Harvey Pratt  was sick, so they asked me to stay on. I did, which meant that I had to  start making some stuff then.  Working in your booth.  Yes, and I didn   t bring anything. What happened was Pat Riley was  coming out, so he brought some stuff for me, some of my artwork,  16  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  brought with him. Mel Cornshucker, he took some of my equipment  back with him. It was weird. I sold like that (Snaps). It was awesome.  Disney, they had asked me,    Would you consider coming back and  doing artwork here more often?    So I started hanging out with some of  the artists who did that, and I thought,    Oh, heck no. Oh, Lord.     Because this is part of Epcot, they like to have artists on site.  Yes, it   s a wonderful gig if your personality can do it. For me, I can   t.  My level of threshold with people is not   I have to keep things  compartmentalized. If I know that I   m going to an event or if I   m going  somewhere public to do something public, then I factor in,    Okay, I   m  going to be there for two hours.    After that, I need two, three hours just  to hang out.  You need to be alone after being in public.  It used to be worse. I actually had it down as a ratio. For every one hour  public, it was three hours private by myself. I   ve gotten a lot better at it.  That way, for me at least, when I go public I can commit to the public,  commit to that wholeheartedly, knowing that there   s a parameter on it.  Remind us quickly about the Epcot show. It was to recognize     The centenary of Oklahoma.     so they sent a contingent of Native and non-Native artists to Epcot.  Let   s talk a bit about your commissions for Choctaw Nation. What have  they been?  They have been very broad in their scope. They   ve consisted of some  pieces that are really   one series I did was with the Choctaw code  talkers from World War I. I did a series on that. I lectured on that while I  was there at NMAI  National Museum of the American Indian .  It was fascinating to me to do something like that because that   s a family  issue for us. My great-grandfather was one of the first five code talkers  in the United States. Then I   ve done a series on Choctaw leaders,  looking back from Tuscaloosa up through some of the Revolutionary  War period leaders like Tappenahomma and up through your more 1812  circa with your Pushmataha, Mushulatubbee, and those, you know, even  looking at some of the newer leaders.  I   ve done work on classic women   s dresses. One of the things that I   m  really curious about that we kind of play around with (we   re not sure  where and how to use it) is I want to eventually do a children   s book  17  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  series using a boy and a girl, brother and sister.  Unfortunately, not including my younger sister because she wasn   t  around (Laughter), but base it really on myself and my middle sister and  what it was like when we left and we come back to our families. That  little series we   ve been toying around with, bouncing back and forth. We  have it, and it   ll be done. It   s just how we want to do it. They   ve been  really good because of the art, yes, but I   ve also worked in capacities as  a delegate for them, an envoy, politically because of my family.  Yes, why don   t you talk a little bit more about the NMAI, the code  talkers celebration there. What was a highlight moment for you?  You know, it   s kind of interesting when you have the French  government represented there because that   s critical. World War I are  code talkers, same in World War II. World War I, every single code  talker took it to his grave. It was top secret, and they took it to their  grave. The only reason we understand what they did now is because of  the French government, not the federal government.  We never would have known, but in 1989 envoys of the French military  arrived in Oklahoma and started going family to family trying to locate  these men. Most of them had died. Matter of fact, all of them had died at  that point. They were bestowing a knighthood to them. It was the  Chevalier de l   Ordre du M  rite Combattant de la Cinquieme  Republique, Knighthood of the Order of Merit, Combatant of the Fifth  Republic.  What was very instructive to me was, while the federal government has  dilly-dallied on getting our medals for years, years, (we   re into decades  now) it   s finally done. It   s finally done. Decades. The French  government gave them knighthood in 1989. To have them there was  important because it was important that the French, and we, in our  relationship with the French which precedes the Americans    creation, is  important as a point of validation to say that our relationships are sound.  Our relationships are healthy. Our relationships are strong. That   s much  more important than art.  Do you do very many booth shows at all?  No.  And you haven   t done Indian Market yet?  No.  18  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  But you do have a gallery in Santa Fe?  I did. I was talking with the owner, and I think she   s going to move on. I  don   t know if I will continue in Santa Fe. I   m actually considering more  up north in Canada. I   m really curious about what is going on in  Vancouver and then, also, over near Quebec with some of the art that   s  Native. I use my art more and more to pay for my travels to certain  places. More and more, I   m like,    Where do I want to go? Do a show  here.    (Laughter) So maybe not being sad about Santa Fe is because I  want to go somewhere new.  I like Santa Fe, and I appreciate what it   s become, but as you know,  Santa Fe is made up mostly of artists not from Santa Fe, artists from the  Northwest, a heck of a lot of artists from Oklahoma. I   m just kind of  tired of people that I know of or people that are clients of mine who are  willing to drive to Santa Fe or even come to France when I was there,  knowing where I live, knowing where my studio is.  Oh, my gosh, you have to tell that story. You had an exhibition in  France, and you actually had clients come out to France to buy?  Yes.  (Laughs) Tell us how the exhibition came about.  Russ Tallchief and I had been talking about doing something in France  for years, and, God bless him, he put it together with an annual show on  paper , so there was a group of Native artists who went. I mean, it was  that simple. It was very odd.  Where was the showing?  At the Grand Palais, and they went again this past year. It was beautiful,  a beautiful place. For me, it was nice to go   it was funny because I   ve  been to Paris. My parents lived in Lyon, France, for years. I speak  French fluently. It was very good to be there with some of my friends...  Good to hang out with. (Laughs)     and I could be translator. I think one of the most special times for me  was there was one night we left early from the Grand Palais, and they   d  just set up a Christmas market along the Champs-Elysees. Literally,  when you came out of the Palais, there you are on this Christmas market.  It went from the Arc de Triomphe down to the Tuileries, and just  gorgeous. Do you know Kennetha and Brent Greenwood?  19  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  I know of them.  Their boy, I think he was about twelve at the time, twelve or thirteen,  somewhere in there. They were all going to meet up at a restaurant, a  whole bunch of people. I was going to go for a walk, and he asked to  come with me. I said,    Sure.    He and I just kind of took off and ran into  Kyle Dillingham. (Laughs) Kyle and Andrea. Kyle is one of my best  friends.  From Oklahoma.  Yes, the violinist. Ran into him on the street. I mean, it just got  ridiculous. (Laughs) It was really cool, though, to be with that boy. You  could kind of see through his eyes again what it was like when I was a  boy, when I saw these things for the first time, when I tasted something  for the first time. He was a good sport about it. I said,    You understand,  you don   t know jack nor shit here, so don   t say no to something. Just try  it once. If you don   t like it, you don   t like it. No big deal.    And he goes,     Cool.     So we go through. I   d say,    Try this. Try this.       Don   t like that.       That   s  cool, but you tried it,    explaining certain things as we went along. That  was really interesting for me. It   s surprising. Surprisingly, that was the  neatest memory that I had of the whole time, was being able to kind of  go full circle in a way.  Plus, while I was there, I was able to find   you know, there was a  gravesite that one of the Ioway people who went with George Catlin to  France, she passed away there. It was a woman. I found where she was  buried. She   s been long since removed because in Europe, because of  space being a premium, you don   t own a plot of land or a cemetery. You  lease it. Neither George Catlin nor her husband or others from the  United States understood that.  She   s long since been disposed of, but I was able to get all that  documentation in thirty minutes, which was awesome, which is like an  all-time first with the bureaucracy in France. I had to put on my charm.  Man, I sweet-talked those ladies. It was ridiculous. It was shameless.  (Laughter) I wanted it. It was shameless. It was pretty dang shameless.  Even then, it wasn   t legal. The Nurse Ratched bureaucrat was just like,     No, we cannot do this without        As I was leaving, this little sweet grandmother had folded the  photocopies of what I needed up, and while I was talking with her, as I  turned around, she did this. (Gestures) She looked at me kind of like this  and slipped it into my book. As I was leaving, I turned away from Nurse  20  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Ratched, I looked at her, I winked, and I said,    Thank you.    (Laughs)  Okay, let   s talk about your techniques a little bit and materials. Do you  work with special pencils? What kind of paper and pencils do you use?  I use no pencils.  Okay.  I use inks and paints.  Are they acrylic or     It   s pretty broad. The paper that I use primarily is a Crescent cotton  paper. The model number is a C1150. I use that for, I should basically  say on rare occasions I don   t use it. The ink that I use is primarily like  Pentel P500, P700 pen for the rendering. I prefer the use of these pens.  They   re much more fluid and consistent throughout. They   re fluid over  more movements, larger movements.  I like using gels because they can be exposed to sunlight indefinitely and  not fade. I firmly believe that as an artist if I know that I can use a  product that can provide a better long-term quality, I   m obligated  ethically to do that. There   s a lot of inks and paints that I just won   t use  because I don   t see the value in them anymore.  So even though it   s a spontaneous process, do you have your concept or  idea in mind before you start?  Sometimes. I should actually say sometimes they   re spontaneous. Most  of the time, they   re very much methodical.  You   ve already planned something out, but you haven   t done any  preparatory sketching?  It depends on how complex it is. If I   m dealing with a piece that is large,  I don   t have the luxury of being able to step back for perspective. I have  to map out placements prior, and those placements dictate how I flow  because I   m not going to flow in a way in which my art is going to brush  over the inkwork and smudge it. I have to plan things out so that I  minimize backtracking so it doesn   t start looking like scribble or get  messy. Conform to that economy of line that I   m trying to do.  It   s almost more like a mapping process.  It is. That is actually what it feels more like.  21  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Let   s talk about your sculptures just a little bit because we haven   t been  able to do that yet. Was the glass tipi series, was that your first  sculptural project?  Yes, that series. I   ve done designs with jewelry, with Jackson Jewelry up  in Stillwater where they   ve actually created some of my designs. I love  working that way. I   m not a sculptor. I   m not a glass person. I   m not a  jeweler. I like to do design work, but I   m not going to go build a new  facility for each one of these. My collaborations are very important,  finding people that are really as serious about their craft as I am mine. I  was very fortunate with Brad Jackson and Peter Jackson at Jackson  Jewelry there in Stillwater.  Are we talking necklaces or     All the artwork there was designed for men: rings, earrings, necklaces,  the whole thing. The whole approach, what I was doing there and what  I   m very curious about is creating something that represents the person.  It   d be like the equivalent of a monogram, but you find a design or  something that represents them that is transferred over and over again  into their life. I like that. In that sense, it   s very simple and very elegant.  With the glasswork, the large glassworks, it   s all collaboration with Gus  Tietsort here in Oklahoma City, Tietsort Design, fourth-generation glass  family, city glass. He does all the really difficult stuff. His dad and  uncles don   t even deal with it anymore. They give it to him. Gus is this  uber-competitive guy who completely understands where I   m going with  what I want. He absolutely understands economy of movement. His  main graphics guy, Brian Culver, has been invaluable in taking my  designs into AutoCADing them so we get the most precise  measurements, get our engineering right.  When you   re dealing with glass, particularly with the larger glass pieces,  you   re really dealing with people   s lives because glass is such a  dangerous, dangerous substance. You cannot afford   I   m not even  talking about liability because it   s not my liability because I   ve already  covered my liability in the sense that the glass I use is ballistic grade. I  have way gone beyond an overkill.  You really have to think about those things. I want the larger pieces to  be fully used by kids. Like the larger tipis, they are to scale what a  children   s tipi is. I want the kids to play with this thing, but when you  have kids around them or when I   m around and the kids are there, I  explain to them,    Your head   s going to give. Your arm   s going to give.  Your knee   s going to give. This isn   t giving.    (Laughter) They ding  22  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  themselves once, and they never do it again. They love to play in them,  which is the purpose.  Right. That was a commission for a particular collector?  Yes, the big one was Dick and Jeannette Sias, who honestly, they are as  important to contemporary Native art as most contemporary Native  artists in Oklahoma. They   re the ones who first gave the big breaks to  Kelly Haney, Ben Harjo. You were on the list. We don   t get to do the  really cool stuff that we want to do until we get that first break. That  person who believes in you is just as important as you.  So do you have plans for another sculpture?  Yes. I   m talking with some people in Russia. That will be for the  original size, and if that gets done, it   ll be about fifty foot.  My goodness.  Hopefully, that gets done. (Laughter) I honestly believe that our art,  particularly Indian-Country art, we need to leave the United States with  it. We do, not only ourselves more justice, I think we do our peoples  more justice that way because then we   re really understanding more  clearly that we are international artists.  So tell me about your creative process a little bit, from the time you get  an idea. Do you write things down in a notebook?  No. I love going on-site and watching people and sketching. That   s how  I like to work, preferably. I like to observe because it   s when I   m  observing movement, I   m really able to see what to that person is a  critical posture, critical stance, critical to them being able to perform  what they   re doing in a way that to them is elegant.  It   s like watching someone who is a chef or someone who is serious  about cook. The movement is right in here. It   s very close. You keep  things close because you   re minimizing the space in which you can hurt  yourself on the elements, whether it   s pots, pans, oven, but also you   re  minimizing how much space you can do and damage you can do to other  people in an area. No big movements with a knife.  It   s not necessarily very dramatic, but that   s not what I   m going for.  When I draw a chef or someone   I remember doing a whole series with  Chef  Andrew  Black when he first came to Skirvin. Those were fun. It  was very much just watching them and watching them and then seeing  how they moved. Same with ballet. I treat them all the same. There   s no  23  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  difference.  But you really like those situations that involve some kind of activity  with movement?  Not even that. Inactivity. I think one of my best portraits was of Jan  Henry, Robert Henry   s wife, when she was just at home with her cats,  reading her book. That really sticks out in my mind as one of my better  pieces because it   s true. That   s how she is. When she   s not in the dental  office working, she wants to be home with those cats, reading, and  probably a glass of chardonnay.  That, to me, is important: trying to get something that   s real. That   s one  of the reasons I don   t like using pictures and photographs, is because it   s  artificial by the time I get it. Even when I do family portraits, I want the  family members to be dressed in something that is quintessentially them,  even if it annoys Mom. Actually, the only way I know it   s true is if it is  annoying Mom. (Laughter) Do you know what I   m saying?  Yes. Do you have a creative routine?  No. Kay very much, Kay Orr, drilled it into me,       This is professional.  You want to be treated like anybody else? Treat yourself like anybody  else.       You wouldn   t dare hope that you go into a surgeon who says,     I   m just not feeling very motivated. I   m not feeling creative.     So every day, you do something in terms of artwork.  Yes.  I meant to ask, too, did she use one-line?  No, not at all. She was very much an expressionist. Fantastic artist. I saw  her artwork for the very first time in Johannesburg at an art gallery there.  It was remarkable. Blew my mind, her colors. As she got older,  developed macular degeneration, those colors became even more  outrageous. She taught me. As an artist, for me, what I walked away  with because our artwork is so different, was two things: in terms of  pedagogically, what to be aware of. Then, technique-wise, what I  walked away with is I do not process shadow. I process light, which I  think is a huge difference. It   s a huge difference.  Is there anything we forgot to talk about before we take a look at your  artwork?  No, can   t think of anything.  24  Little Thunder  Smalling  I   m going to have you talk about this piece a little bit. This piece is  untitled, which I guess is sometimes typical.  For my work, it   s very rare that I will actually title something. Very rare  that I   ll title something. Now, I generally will begin somewhere around  the head like on a figure. This one, very much a Plains Fancy Shawl  Dancer. I should say, for those who don   t know about Fancy Shawl  work or dancing, they   re trying to emulate the butterfly. The movements  are trying to express that.  This is on cotton paper, and so on here to give some technique, (it   s hard  to see it) there   s a ridge quality in here, a contoured ridge quality you see  here, here, here, all throughout it. This happens from laying the ink in  first, and then with a flat object, before it dries, depressing the areas in a  contoured way so it keeps that ridge form, contrasted here along the  edges with gel ink.  This size, I   ll use a lot of gel pens. I love using gel pens because they so  mimic the texture and refraction of our beadwork. They really do look  very approximate with the beadwork, how it shimmers in the sunlight or  any light. I like adding that because now what we   re seeing, too,  especially up north up in Canada and on the West Coast, what we   re  starting to see here is now you   re getting into the face, the shimmering  being brought into the face, like the beadwork that they   re wearing,  which, I think, that   s awesome.  This idea of the movement and the movement that any dancer   this is a  dance posture that they assume a lot, and I like doing that. I did a whole  series, one whole show, five stances from different styles of dance, the  dance moves and the movements and postures that the judges would be  looking for, which I think is really good because then, when someone  goes to a powwow or goes to a dance, they can see,    Ah, so that   s what  the judge is looking for.     I love drawing this stuff. This actually comes from my own collection. I  keep pieces back. I didn   t want to be caught in a situation like when I  was at the Jacobson House on the Board. It would tear my heart up  whenever we would be presenting some descendant, some young  daughter or whatever   I remember the youngest child of one of the  Kiowa Six, her very first and only original piece from her father. That   s  not right.  I decided long ago that not only pieces that I particularly like myself, but  I have kept the majority of the most important pieces that have been  published or have been shown. I kept them to myself so if my artwork  25  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  Little Thunder  Smalling  does get to the point that it has a credible value for my tribe, it can either  be donated to the tribe as a living trust from my family or that it   s just in  trust for my nieces, nephews, and so on because I don   t want them to get  in a situation like that.  Did it take you a little while to come up with your signature?  No, I   ve had that signature for years.  Sometimes it   s a little bit of a trick deciding where you want to put it.  I don   t know. It   s never been   it   s always just been right there. I think I  did it because I didn   t want it to interfere with any of the inkwork  anywhere else. There it is. It   s done. It   s simple, and it   s out of the way.  All right, well, thank you for taking the time to talk with us today.  My pleasure.  -------  -------
