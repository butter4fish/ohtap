 Wilson  Today is March 14, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Oklahoma State  University Library. I am at Rose Manor in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and am  excited today to be talking with Mary Jo Guthrie-Edgmon. I will be  interviewing Mary Jo today as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral  history project. Thank you for having me here.  You   re welcome.  To start out, would you tell me when and where you were born?  When, December 24, 1922. Where, Okemah, Oklahoma. Now, is that it?  Were you born in a hospital?  No. I was born at home, I   m sure. I don   t remember that.  Right. (Laughs) That   s understandable. And what were your parents     names?  Charlie Edward and Nora Belle Guthrie.  And were you their first child?  No, their last one. I brought up the caboose.  How many had come before you?  Clara, Roy, Woody, George. Four. I was the fifth one.  And Clara would have been seventeen years older than you?  5  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Yes, seventeen years. We   re all five years apart except for Clara being  the oldest. She was seventeen and Roy was fifteen when I was born so  he was only fifteen years older.  And Woody was ten and George was five?  Five.  Wow.  George and I were reared closest together because we were   Aunt  Maude and Uncle Robert took George and me in when my mother was  hospitalized.  How old were you when you moved in with them?  Three. They called Papa at his office and said,    Charlie, there   s a little  girl downtown out on the street, and we think it   s your little girl.    So  Papa came down and sure enough, it was me. My mother was  irresponsible during this time, and he could see that. He just picked me  up and put me   he had a Model-A Ford. It was a Model-A, and went  out to the house   don   t remember any of this. This is hearsay   and he  took me and we went out to the house, and he gathered up a few little  things, a change of clothes, that   s about all. And when I got out to Aunt  Maude   s, and I had a dress that was scorched real bad, like it had been     and I thought,    Somewhere, this has been in that fire,    because there was  a fire at the house when Papa was burned really bad. And Aunt Maude,  as I said, Papa took me first, and then later when school was out, he put  George on a train, and George came from Okemah to Groom, Texas on a  train.  And is Groom in the area of Pampa?  Yes. It   s between Pampa and Amarillo. It   s about thirty miles from  Pampa.  So do you remember your mother at all?  No. I lived to see the day when Papa brought the letter in saying  Momma had died. Aunt Maude and Uncle Robert were visiting Alene  and Jeff there in Pampa. And I remember going to the bathroom and just  crying my eyes out. Nobody knew that. They didn   t come to me and say,     Honey, your Momma died.    Papa just walked in with the letter and  read it, just kind of like I wouldn   t be interested and I wouldn   t care.  And I thought,    Well, there goes my       Woody was always going to  take me to see Momma when he had a car and was old enough to drive.  6  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  That didn   t happen. I never did get over that, years.  I   ll tell you how I accepted the death of my mother. I just wanted to  know my mother all the time. There are pictures up there. (Gestures)  And I thought she was so pretty in her pictures and Papa was a  handsome man. Papa was so proud, and fate just wasn   t in his corner.  But that man lived and died with dignity all my life. Never down, never  blamed, never mad, no excuses. World   s greatest optimist, and he reared  all   we were all alike. We didn   t sit around and bemoan. We just were  so happy and right now I   m happy. I said,    I   m happier right now than  I   ve been since my husband died.    But they think,    The last place to go  is the nursing home  Ehh  The home     And so, I just decided, it   s just a  country club. I   m at the club. I   m going to go to the club. The hall out  there is the boulevard, I think I told you that. So I didn   t have to use that  tried and true and worn out lingo. I   ve got a whole new world, and I love  it. I just love it.  When my niece gets to where   well, when they come back, they   re both  on crutches, my niece and her daughter, Karen, my great-niece. And  she   of course, they   re all crutches and braces, so she can   t lift and walk  and do a bunch of stuff. But when they get to where they can, they   ll  come back and I will have gone through all the things. See, they brought  all this stuff to my room for me to go through and keep what I wanted to  keep here. Well, they had their accident and they haven   t been back so I  was stuck and I had all this stuff ready. And they even bought and built  one of those storage sheds so they could take care of my stuff. (Laughs)  But anyway, it   s been a wild time, I   ll tell you.  So were you eight years old when your mother died?  Yes, eight years old. And I remember being there and down at Aunt  Maude   s in the kitchen, and she was   I   d been with her five years, and  she was packing up my things to send with me. I remember that when I  got to Pampa, to where Papa took me and met my step-mother, I  remember we were unpacking some things and Aunt Maude had put in a  little sugar bowl. I mean, just a few little things that we   d need. And I  remember picking up this and I said,    Here you are, Momma.    I had  never been able to call anybody Momma, but I remember that I called  her Momma.  What was her name?  Betty Jean.  How old were you when they got married?  7  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Eight.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  And then you moved to Pampa with your father and her?  Yes, and George was with me, and that   s the years that I was with  Woody, and Jeff and Allene  Guthrie  were there, we all were in Pampa.  In fact, they were having a celebration. They have one every year for  Woody in Pampa.  Oh, really?  You should go there sometime.  Yes.  It   s just in a nutshell, but it is so complete. They bought the old Harris  Drugstore where Woody worked for Shorty Harris in his drugstore.  There was a guitar in the back end, just an old beat up guitar, and Shorty  gave it to Woody, and that was the beginning. And then, of course, Jeff  and Allene were there, and he  had  one of the most beautiful tenor  voices you ever heard. I get lonesome to hear him sing every once in a  while.  Jeff?  Jeff. He was a wonderful musician. And they were all funny. We  laughed  a lot  and everybody was happy.  Well, what do you remember about your Aunt Maude   s house? Did they  live on a farm?  Yes.  And there were two daughters there     No, Allene was married.  Oh, when you lived there, she was?  I went to Aunt Maude and Uncle Robert when I was three years old.  Papa took me from picking me up on the street in downtown Okemah  and brought me to Groom, Texas.  8  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  And did your two cousins live there with you at the time, or were they  older?  Just Neva. Neva was the same age of George. And then George came  out two or three months later, because he had to wait until school was  out. We were together the whole time, George and I were. And we lived  on 417 North Hill Street, Pampa, TX, and he had a confrontation with  my step-mother and just walked off, and that   s the last I had seen him  for about twelve years. I   ll never forget him walking out the door and  just going, didn   t take anything with him, and went up to Browning  Street, in stark weather, in Pampa. And there is where Jeff and Allene  had an apartment. They were there, and George then stayed there until  he went to California. I don   t know if he hitchhiked or not. He must   ve,  because we didn   t have any money. We didn   t have a car.  Did Woody live in the house with your father and Betty?  Well, he was there  some . He married when he was about eighteen,  nineteen, somewhere along there. Of course, that took care of that, and  he lived with us briefly there on Hill Street, 417 North Hill. I   ll never  forget that.  Did you spend much time with him and his wife in their home?  It was normal. Where they lived, after they married, they rented a little  three-room home across   well just pretty close to the Woody Guthrie  Inn. That   s what they call all that out there where Woody   s stuff is. And  yes, I went to see him. It was all the way across town. A lady wrote me  the other day, just about your caliber. I remember her and I kept the  letter, and she said,    I still have the prints.    I was calling them posters,  and they got a hold of me and they said,    Mary Jo, these are not posters.  They   re prints. Art prints.       Okay.    (Laughter)  A lady wrote you the letter about them?  Yes, and she said,    My favorite story of the print was telling about the  Montgomery Ward up there.    He was walking back from 417 North  Hill, and we had to go up a hill, which was Browning Street, to Main  Street. And we got up there and had a big, pretty Montgomery Ward.  And Woody would get up there and I drew us, and we   re standing at the  window looking in right there in the very middle.  Yes, I see that.  And he   s just thinking,    Let me see how much money I   ll have.    He  9  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  emptied both   he went in and checked both pockets to see what money  had came up. I believe it was about one dollar and sixty cents, something  like that. And he said,    Let   s go in and see what this will buy.    We went  inside and I   ll never  forget . I can just see that little sweater just like it  was today. It was two shades of green, and it had a little tie up here with  a little buckle. Then we   re looking around and I don   t know the clerk  who might   ve found the hat, but in there I   ve got a little side bubble  showing where I   ve got the tam, and it pointed to the little matching  green tam exactly to match it. He bought me that, too.  Wow.  And I remember that. He was a great guy. My brothers, I just idolized  each one of them. And I didn   t ever want to   in Woody   s position, as he  became well-known, it was easy, but I never ever wanted to leave Roy  and George out of the picture because they were just as important, and to  this day they are. And George had a son that died with a heart attack  when he was forty years old. Oh, I loved that Chris. His name was Chris.  I have a grandson named Chris and a granddaughter named Christy. But  anyway, that was the Montgomery Ward story. When you sit and you  study and you read all the captions   and he had sayings, he was all,  well, like,    So long, it   s been good to know you,    and I put them all in  there because I loved his   I can   t read it quite that well, but they   re all  in there and they   re real interesting.  Did he tell you a lot of stories?  No, I just lived them. I lived those. We were living them together. He  didn   t have any stories to tell me.  What about his time in Okemah?  We were together. I mean, well, first of all, let   s say   no, he was gone  from Okemah by the time I got up big enough to know anything about it.  Where did he work in Pampa?  Harris Drugstore.  What did he do there?  Well, just waited on customers, I guess.  Was it a soda shop, too?  Yes. You could get cold drinks.  10  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Would you go there and sit at the counter?  No, because it was during the prohibition and my parents didn   t want me  to be hanging out around it. His wife   s brother, I   ve got him at the  fountain in that Pampa one. He   s at the drugstore, and he   s being served  right there. Yes, right there. (Gestures)  Yes.  And Matt Jennings is on the stool. And then that   s Black Sunday, yes,  that one. (Gestures) And see all the kids running from the baseball field  to the house? Because we didn   t know what it was. And see the bats and  mitts and balls just a flying as the kids are running?  Well, what do you remember about that day?  Just exactly what   s there.  Were you at the baseball field?  There   s me.  Okay. You   re there. (Laughs)  That   s my life. That   s my part for people that don   t have a special one  because a lot of them come that are from New York, one   s come from  California, and they want those. But now, I don   t   and the only way that  you can get the Okemah one is you have to buy the set, because the  train   s no good without an engine, and that   s the engine.  And we   ll just say for the record, this wasn   t on when we were talking  about those earlier, but we   re talking about these prints that you drew  chronicling Woody   s life. One is in Okemah, one is in Pampa, Texas,  one is in California     Los Angeles.  Los Angeles, and then New York City.  Right.  And they   re four different prints that Mary Jo has   they   re fantastic.  We   ll get those on video in a little while that tell the story of his life.  Yes. It   s from birth. See, he   s up there in that corner being born. And  11  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  he   s down here in this corner where he   s just died. He   s sitting on the  lawn of the hospital.  That   s neat. And so his first wife was Mary?  Mary, Mary Jennings. Her brother was Matt.  Did they have an actual wedding ceremony?  Oh, yes.  Did you go to the ceremony?  No, I was just eight years old back then. He had his own life, but he did  put on a suit and was married. (Laughs) He looked nice. He was about  sixteen to nineteen years old those years, and then George was there the  whole time, too. George and I were the ones that were together, and we  went to school together, we lived together. When we moved, we moved  together, but Woody had his own life. He came and went at his own     but he just come to see us every day just like any brother or son would to  come see his dad.  Do you remember him playing music at that point?  Oh, my goodness, yes. I   m telling you, every Saturday night we had  folks, and they were all musicians. Aunt Maude was at the old pump  organ, Uncle Robert was at the fiddle, and Jeff, guitar. Allene was on the  accordion. And let   s see, who did the mandolin? Woody   s first  instrument I can remember was the mandolin, because it was little. And  at one time I remember he taught me the chords, and I thought,    Look  there     I had the best teacher in the whole wide world, and all I learned  was to finger, I think. He showed me how you feel them. They said,     Well, everybody played instruments and music, did you play?    I said,     Yes, I did. I was real good at the radio.    (Laughter)  What about Roy or George?  No. All club feet and hoarse voice. We didn   t have any of that. Woody  had it all. I think we had it, but we just didn   t know what to do with it.  Roy had as beautiful a voice as you ever want to hear. He could sing and  oh, he was   my brothers were all different in a sense because Roy was  the handsome one. I mean, really handsome. And Woody, you won   t  believe it, but he was handsome, too. But I   ve got one of his favorite  pictures that I just love, and he   s just really handsome. And George,  through the years, he grew up    But Woody and George, in pictures that  they would send me, they were so much alike I   d almost have to see  12  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  their names.  George used to send them from the service, the navy. He   d be out  around those airplanes and just exactly like Woody. And I   d look at it  and I   d say,    Well, these are George, they   re not Woody.    And Roy was  taller, and George and Woody and I were shorter. And, oh, it was  broken, but my father, he was a wonderful man and, some way or  another, he held us all together just by letters. He wrote letters. He wrote  letters all the time. We didn   t have phones. We didn   t have a car. Our  only communication was writing letters. I   d write to Papa and then he in  turn would   he wrote to one of the boys, he   d send my letter. And then  when he   d get a letter from them, he   d send it to me. So, we had letters  going all the time.  Do you still write letters to people?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Papa and the boys did, too. Woody was   and my dad  read the dictionary just like it was a book. He loved words, and I  inherited that from my father.  That   s wonderful.  I love it, too. And my father, he just always raised me to be a lady.  Wildest hair you   d ever want, but I was a lady, and Papa never saw it.  Well, I was just a growing girl and just happy, and we didn   t wear jeans  back then. We just wore nice little cotton sack dresses, flour sack  dresses.  Who would make those for you?  Aunt Maude. She was a great seamstress, and then it   there   s just no  end. You need to just continue with the questions because I get off on a  rant when you leave me by myself. (Laughter)  Did Aunt Maude quilt?  Oh, yes. And when I married, my husband   s mother did, too, and she  and I made quilts together. I quilted several quilts.  And was she a good cook, Aunt Maude?  Oh, sure. We didn   t know what bad cooks were. (Laughter)  What are some of your favorite dishes you remember her making?  Well, if you ever eat with me and they   re ever having beans and corn  13  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  and stuff like that, you   re going to notice that I   ll say,    Pass me the  sugar, please.    And you   ll say,    What   s that for?       My beans.     (Laughter) And anyway, the reason for that was Aunt Maude made  dessert every day. Every dinner, we had dessert, and she fed us good.  And I remember this particular day or time, I raced in   we called it  breakfast, dinner, and supper. She called us in to dinner and I got in  there first, and I sat down at the table. We had a bench along one side of  the long table where George and Neva and I sat, and I sat there and I got  that, and I got a piece of the cake.  Aunt Maude made a little cake almost every day, and I reached over and  got a piece of that cake and put it on my plate. She says,    You can   t eat  that cake until you   ve eaten your dinner.       Okay.    I probably said,    All  right,    then, I don   t know if we knew what    Okay,    meant. But anyway,  I got it and then when she wasn   t looking, I   d take a bite, and she wasn   t  looking, I   d take a bite of cake. And all during the meal, I   d take a bite  of that, and I   d eat a bite of cake. And I learned to like sweets, and corn  was the same way. I love it. And this place here fixes the best creamed  corn you   d ever want to eat, just like Aunt Maude fixed it.  Did they raise a big garden?  Oh my goodness, yes. Looked like a parking lot at the mall. (Laughter)  Did you have many chores when you were living with them?  Just nominal, yes. Yes, made my own bed. But I loved to keep house,  and I loved to clean and dust and dig. And I entertained myself that way,  and I do to this day. Of course, you can   t tell it now, I outgrew it. But  no, I had my cousin that lived   Neva, we slept together and Allene  loves to   we were all together, Jeff and Allene and their little girl, Patty  Jean. Patty Jean was here during all this. Jeff and Allene   s daughter and  granddaughter were here. Well, I   d get up and make the bed or whatever  I was supposed to do, and Neva would make up her side of the bed or  whatever. And they tell the story about when Neva would get out of her  side, I   d get over there and make the bed over because it just wasn   t  good enough. (Laughter) I didn   t realize I did that, but they told me that  I was the particular one.  We got that from Papa. He wanted everything   it may be dusty, but it  was in order. He   d never be like this. (Laughter) And one time I   well,  when I would stay with him, go up and spend the day, I   d try to tidy up.  And he   d say,    Now, Mary Jo, don   t get my things out of order because  I have to have them to where I can find them in the dark.    And he said,     I like to be able to put my hands on my things in the dark.    And I can  do that in this room, because I   ve got a lot of street light out there.  14  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  (Laughter) But anyway, I remember George came to see me one time,  and I had a drawstring on a venetian blind that needed to be fixed, and  George   s little old hands, he made that, and he wrote   he was just an  artist with just his writing. I kept a lot of his letters that were fixed real  pretty on the envelope, and he liked to do that. But neither one of us  mastered any kind of an instrument, or Roy. Woody was the one that  took that, but George did write real pretty, wrote his letters, were just  artist pretty. I never did throw them away.  What was his profession?  Well, probably military because he was in the navy all those years and  retired. And then he was in   what   s it when you go and retire and then  you go back in? Yes, he was a navy man.  And what about Roy?  Roy was with Sinclair Oil. He was a clerk, more or less. When the years  we were in Konawa, he was the manager of Streetman   s Food Market  there for ten years, and he was a clerk more or less then, typing and  office work. Yes, like that. Various, both feet on the ground, very  staunch and disciplined, and George, too. They didn   t roam and ramble.  Woody did that for all of them. (Laughter) But I said,    If I   d have been a  boy, I   d have been right there with Woody,    because truly, Woody and I  thought alike, did alike, acted alike. Just did.  One time, I took a trip on a bus to see Woody in the hospital. The whole  trip, anything I could find to write on, I made little notes of the highway.  I   ve got that all documented. I got to New York and was showing them  my notes.    My God, you   re just like Woody     All these little bitty notes  and papers. I did. I still write a lot. I   ve written all kinds of letters,  documenting when my grandkids would come and see me, and I   d tell  the little stories. I just like to write, and Papa did, too. We worked  crossword puzzles. When I got up to this age, all my people working  crossword puzzles, they think that   s the reason I   ve still got a mind.  (Laughter) Papa, he loved the crossword puzzles. And my daughter-in-law  was in that Sudoku. But anyway, now, you keep asking questions as  long as you need to.  Okay. Well, what do you remember about Betty Jean?  The Bible says we   re supposed to forgive, forgive and forget. They were  with   she was cruel. She was intimidating, and she took a little boy in to  raise, his name was Fritz, and that little boy, I just loved him like my  little brother. He   s dead, now, but Roy kidnapped me from Betty Jean.  And Fritz wrote a letter that I got eventually and he said,    I just wish  15  Wilson  Edgmon  that Roy would have taken me, too,    and I cried. Oh, how awful it was  to leave there   but he stayed with her a little bit, and they moved from  Borger, Texas to Orange, California. He ran across one of his uncles that  lived there, and he was up seventeen or eighteen years old by then, and  he left Betty Jean. I don   t know what     But Woody wrote something about she was a mail-order bride. She  was   and you know, now that death has taken apart and separated us, all  I remember are the good things about her. That   s the way God wanted  you to. And I figured if she lived today, I would go to where she was  and sit on her lap and tell her I loved her because she loved   she was  affectionate, but she was a large lady and very homely. She   d come to  school, and I was ashamed of her. You can   t imagine. Well, she   d go off  and she   d buy me things and come back. She went shopping, and I  remember the first bra I ever had. So, she, down deep, she was good and  she was thinking. And she bought George and I both a bicycle. She  claimed to be a magnetic healer, and everywhere we lived, she put an ad  in the paper. She had her patients, and that   s the way we lived.  Were you ever treated by her in the way that patients were?  Yes, supposed to have gotten rid of my tonsils and adenoids, but I  didn   t. (Laughs) No, but she had patients from all over. And people in  the neighborhood rented rooms to people that would come for  treatments. But she was real heavy, and she didn   t really wear  undergarments that would contort, just everything was real loose and  baggy. She never wore makeup, never fixed her hair, she   d just comb it.  She   d comb it right here where all the little things were right in front of  her ears, just little rose buds. But you know, I forgave her. Well, I just  got to where I thought only of the good things.  She bought me a beautiful doll, she bought bicycles. She wanted to be a  mother so bad. And Papa, I don   t know where he found her or anything  about it, but they didn   t get along. They had fights all the time, and she  was mean. Big, could overpower Papa, and she   d grab him and tear his  clothes off of him. I witnessed that, and he was a perfect gentleman. He  never raised a hand. He   d grab her hands and hold them to keep her from  fighting him and grabbing him and tearing his clothes.  One time, she bought me a dress. I was a little ol    skinny eight-year-old  or nine-year-old, and she brought it in, and the waist of it struck me right  on about here, sleeves right along about here. (Gestures) I was  disappointed, and I said something about it being big, and she was so  mad, and ripped that, started tearing that and ripping it off of me. It was  just hanging in shreds off of me when she got through. She did  something to my brother. He did something, and he was about twelve,  16  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  fourteen years old, and she pinned a diaper on him. I never forgot that.  And my little brother, she caught him   she smoked, like a chimney, and  she caught him smoking one day, a snipe. She sent him to the store and  made him buy a pack of cigarettes, brought them back   I   ll never ever  forget   had him sitting in the living room, in our room, and she sat there  and made him smoke every cigarette in that package.  How old was he?  Oh, just a little boy, twelve, ten, eleven.  How old was he when she adopted him?  First grade. We didn   t adopt. His mother worked in a dress shop  downtown, and she had a room in a hotel right there close to her dress  shop. But he was getting ready to go to school, and she talked to my  folks about letting him come out and live with us. He   d have a  neighborhood, and he enrolled in Woodrow Wilson School in Pampa,  Texas. And when he got grown and married and had his own three sons,  one of his sons, Gary, was visiting his dad and found one of Fritz   s  reports cards that said,    Roy Fritz Guthrie.     Well, in the meantime, Gary had become a big fan of Bob Dylan and  Woody Guthrie, and when he saw that Guthrie, well, then when he got  the connection, he became very, very close to me. See that picture right  there, that drawing?  Yes.  He was big in folk music, and he went to the people, went to the artists,  the book publishers and everything. He came out in   what   s that folk  music magazine that   s so popular? Anyway, he went and got permission  and they recreated that. It was just a little picture in a magazine, and he  had it on his desk framed in a little frame. And when he got the  connection with Woody, he took that and had that made and shipped to  me. Just like that.  Wow, that   s neat.  And he sends me cards, and I   ve taught them that I am their aunt.    I am  your aunt,    and they love it. And Gary   s a musician, too, plays the  guitar.  Well, how old were you when your father separated from Betty Jean?  My oldest brother, Roy, came to Borger, Texas, one Sunday. I   m  17  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  visiting a neighbor down from our house on the corner, and I look out  and there   s Roy, sitting down there  in his car  at the curb. And I was,  see, I guess I was a junior in high school and I said,    There   s my big  brother     And I went bouncy, bouncy, bouncy down the steps built into  the lawn up to the house, and he said,    Get in, Jo.    I said,    Roy, the  lady   s with us today and they fixed dinner and it   s ready. I can   t leave.     He said,    Well, I   m just going down here to the corner to turn around  and come back.     We didn   t do that. We went to the corner and we turned that way. I said,     Roy, Roy,    because oh, my step-mother was mean, unbearable.    Roy,  I   m already in big trouble,    because me, a man, here I am, sixteen years  old getting in a strange car with a man. I said,    Oh, Roy, you   ve got to  do          Well, I   m going to go, I   ll go down here and get to this next  corner, just be okay. I   ll come back.    We   re here. We got to this corner,  and that   s where he said,    I   m going to circle the block.    Get to this  corner, he comes on down here, gets to this corner, he didn   t circle the  block, because he would come this way, but he went that way.  I started crying, and he pulled over to the curb and handed me a letter  from my dad. It said,    Mary Jo, go with Roy like a good little girl. Your  momma will understand,    and I did. I sung. Every step of the way, I  sung. He stopped at the two aunts   . The first aunt gave me some clothes,  a skirt, and the second aunt gave me her winter   well, it was getting  early spring and it was cold. They gave me clothes. And the coat that I  got, my   Allene was a beautiful seamstress, and she had made herself a  three-piece woolen suit. I   ll never forget, it was a soft, blue, plaid.  Beautiful  And she gave me the top coat of that to wear until I got back  to Konawa. I got back there, and then we boxed her coat and got it right  back to her.  Well, when had your father left?  Oh, Papa had left way before that. He left on the pretense of going to  find work in Oklahoma. Well, I think he knew when he left, he wasn   t  coming back.  So you lived there without him for a few years?  Oh, yes, and that   s when somebody pointed out to me,    Well, Mary Jo,  if it hadn   t have been for your step-mother, she was the bread winner.     And then I got to thinking,    There wasn   t anything in it for her.    But she  had this thing about wanting these kids. Fritz and I were hers. I wasn   t  allowed to tell them that she was my step-mother, she was our mother.  Roy was my step-brother.  18  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Oh.  Ooh. And I never will forget, when I   d get in the car going back to  Oklahoma, I said,    You   re my real brother, now     (Laughter) I   ll never  forget telling him that.  And he was living in Konawa?  Yes, he was really an established man there in Konawa, and he was  highly respected. And this lady, Ann, she was just a few years older than  me, and we   ve always   she   s just like my mother or my sister. She   s  wonderful. She   s so good to me.  How long did you live with her and Roy?  Two years. My husband graduated the year before I did, and he and his  mother, our house was here. There   s a street and an intersection, and our  house was here. And Hulett and his momma   s house was right there, go  to the corner and turn, right there. Anyway, Hulett was everything in a  nice boyfriend you   d want. He was a perfect gentleman. He didn   t drink,  but everybody smoked. In fact, he did smoke, but not    And all the  years, sixty-five years, he had a job. He never was out of a job. He was  such a good provider, and he was a banker and good in figures. If I  wanted to add something, I   d say,    What is that?    And he   d say,    Well,  you          That   s why I married you. You   re good in arithmetic. Add it.     (Laughter)  So you graduated from Konawa High School?  Both of us did.  What year did you graduate?  1940.  Okay. And he graduated in 1939?     39, yes.  When did you get married?     40.  In Konawa?  Yes.  19  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  At a church, or   ?  Yes, the pastor   s study. It was just    But Roy, I never will forget it. Of  course, he always wore, in his white shirt and tie, in his store he was the  manager, had his office. But I   ll never forget he was there, he had taken  off work, and he   d put it on and had his    He was in his suit and he and  Mary Ann, I asked her one time,    Mary Ann, where were you? I don   t  remember.    But she was there, as a little girl. She would   ve been about  three or four years old.  It has been a wonderful life. But it was a true case of kidnapping because  he was on his way around his block again. He kept circling thinking  maybe he   d find me out, and he really did. And then he said,    Now, we  may get in trouble because I   m taking you across the state line,    and we  didn   t. Nobody stopped us, and we got clear to his house and enrolled in  school. They told me for about the first week I was there   well, he  didn   t let me go for several days. He wanted to be sure, and then he  really cautioned me. He said,    Don   t you get in the car with anybody  unless it   s me or Ann,    and I didn   t. But he was afraid she   d come, send  somebody to get me back.  Did you ever hear from her?  No, and I wrote to her for some clothes, and she never sent me none. She  said,    Your clothes are here. When you get back, they   re here.    And that  was okay, and Fritz was there.  Did you stay in touch with Fritz?  He went into the service, and I lost track of him for years. No, because  he went into Guam, and George, my brother, did too. It was during the  war, and I   m not even sure I knew where Fritz was for years. But we did  have a wonderful brother-sister relationship . I called him my little  brother. He was precious.  What was his last name?  Buzbee, B-U-Z-B-E-E. Fritz, Roy Fritz Buzbee. He had a brother  named   no, a sister. Ray Bob was his brother, and his sister, he called  her something else  Dedo , kind of a nickname. It doesn   t matter, but  they never did come to see him, nothing. He was my little brother, and I  loved him with a passion.  How did you get the nickname    Tinkin?     20  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Woody. It   s all he ever called me was Tinkin, and I wanted that on my  book so bad. Just in his memory. But I found out in the publishing  world, you don   t have much to do with it. And the man that worked with  me eight years, they didn   t even have his name anywhere  And I  changed that.  Who was that?  That man is D. Jones. Dwight D. Jones, and he   s one of the big workers  in the Woody Guthrie Coalition, with his wife, both of them were. And I  said,    No way  His name       So, they told me I   m supposed to write  something. What   s it called? An introductory. Tell me how I should start  that. I   m supposed to write something about D.  Oh, for the introduction?  Yes, so I haven   t done that yet.  When is that due?  Well, by July. I   ll probably work on that when I go home. Well, see, for  a long time, I couldn   t even write. I   m just now getting where I can  control the pen. When I went to live with Aunt Maude, I remember  she   d make Neva a dress or she   d make me one. I remember standing by  her machine and being fitted all those years, and I had all my clothes and  my step-mother made fun of me and wouldn   t let me wear them. In  thirteen years, I was never allowed to go see Aunt Maude. She was  insanely jealous  of Aunt Maude .  We went to see Aunt Maude one time. I had to stand right by her side  the whole time because she was scared I   d get off. One time, Roy and  Ann came to see me and the door got closed. Their little girl pushed a  door closed.    What   d you tell your brother? What was you all talking  about? What were you doing?    She   s so guilty.    What   d you tell your  brother? What   d you tell Roy? What were they asking you?    Had such  an evil mind. But you know, I think that   s what   I mean, I think it   s  good to go through the valleys and the hills and the valleys of life,  you   learn. Papa was such a great man, and he would say,    Honey, that   s  okay. No matter how bad things get, they could always be worse.     That   s a good attitude.  Yes, it was.  After you moved to Konawa, did you see your father?  21  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Well, Papa lived in the city the whole time, yes.  Did he come visit Konawa, or did you go visit him in the city?  Well, both ways, but he didn   t have a car. He traveled everywhere by  bus, and we didn   t have a car. Roy had a car, and he   d go see Papa. But  you   ve got to remember that Hulett and I dated seven months and then  we married. He had to work and we had a car by then, because I saved  up enough money on my army pay to buy that little car. I believe it was  a 1939 Plymouth. Anyway, we drove that for several years, and then we  got another one.  And what about Woody, did he come visit Konawa?  Oh, no. No, the only way he traveled was by foot, freight. No.  I read somewhere that he brought Pete Seeger to visit Konawa one time.  Well, he could do things that I would not be aware of. Pete Seeger was  wonderful, and he   s been Woody   s buddy for as far back as I can  remember.  Have you met him?  Oh, yes. He   s one of my greatest friends because he was so good and,  well, was good for Woody.  Have you met many of his other friends through the years?  I was thinking I was seeing that little train in that picture up there.  (Laughs) Oh, yes. Elliot, Jack Elliot, is that his name? Yes, I met him  and Lefty Lou, of course, we   ve all met her because she came back. It  wasn   t like an ongoing relationship from first grade to marriage and all  in-between, it was just spurts like here and there. I   ve been interviewed  probably fifty or sixty times through the years. You   re going to find  basically the same information because I just know what    It won   t be  the same words, but it   ll be the same instances and when I drew those  things, that   s kind of the same thing.  Were you getting letters from Woody throughout your teenage years?  That   s what it   s all about. That   s what all that   s about. Woody   s letters.  One of the pictures in there, I believe it   s the Los Angeles one, it shows  an old dresser   not an old dresser but a dresser   here it is, right here, on  the left-hand corner. (Gestures) Now, go up, right there. That   s the  dresser, and at night when Woody would come in, he   d take those bits  22  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  and pieces out of his pockets where he   d been writing all day long  because he went with pencil and paper all the time. And to do their  laundry, she   d empty his pockets, and that was what would be in his  pockets, and she   d just thrown them away. One time, she opened up one  or two and got to reading, and she said,    You know, this is good stuff,     and she got to where she just put it in boxes and put it under the bed.  And he just had boxes and boxes of letters, notes.  And that was Marjorie that would     Take care. She saw the genius in Woody, and she got    Harold  Levanthall was a business manager for the stars, Pete Seeger and Jack  Elliot and Arlo, and he took Woody under his wing and then Woody   s  life began to blossom. Of course, he was getting sick by that time.  Nobody knew that it was the same thing that killed Momma.  Well, as you got older and as Woody lived in different places around the  United States, did you ever see him perform at a show somewhere?  No, he didn   t do that, then. He just went with a guitar on his back and  would sing at the migrant camps. There was some maps and stuff to that  effect there in a Los Angeles one.  When do you recall hearing him first on the radio?  Well, Allene and Woody and Jeff and one other friend had a little music  group, and they performed every day at noon in Pampa, KPDN, and I  heard them on the radio. And then, of course, there was Saturday night,  everybody converged on our house, and we just had hootenannies, music  all the time. I can   t remember when we didn   t have music.  And was that when you lived with Maude and Robert?  No, that was Step-mother and Papa.  Okay. Was your step-mother musical?  No.  But she liked to listen to music?  I guess she did.  Good. And what did your father play?  Nothing. Way back as a young man, he picked the banjo, but he had  23  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  hands that were gnarled from accidents. Back then, they didn   t go to the  doctor and set your hand or put pins in it so it   d grow straight. They just  left it alone. And Woody   s got a crooked arm. One of his arms is bent   from breaking it  like this all the time. (Gestures)  What was that from?  Well, it was when he lived in Topanga Canyon in California. That was  Will Geer   s place. I don   t know the details of that. Hulett used to get  mad at me because I didn   t care anything about money. It didn   t bother  me. If it was fifty cents or  500 dollars. That bothered him because he  was a good manager, never wanted for a thing in all those sixty-five  years. We never got a done for a bill, never was without a job. He was  very, very steady, and that   s what I wanted out of life, because I hadn   t  been used to that. We   d just kind of lived from hand to mouth in rental  property. When you   re that age, you don   t really need anything, but it  never bothered me that I didn   t have    But I know when I was in high  school, when I was living with Papa and Betty Jean, when you   d go  upstairs, I   d wait until everybody was upstairs before I   d go up, because  the bottom of my shoes were out. I didn   t want anybody to see that so I  didn   t go. See, they   d be behind you going upstairs so I waited until the  bell rung to go upstairs to my room. I remember that. And I had friends,  but I didn   t have girlfriends. Nobody came to see me, and I didn   t go to  see them, because we were just kind of ho-hum.  Did you go to church?  On my own, by myself. I have a thing I wrote called Woody   s Religion  or something. The man wrote to me to get me to shed a little light on  that, and I think I put it   it was kind of like a   I don   t remember when  we all didn   t believe in Jesus and prayer. That was just born into us. We  respected the Lord. We respected our church. Aunt Maude and them  were all Church of Christ people, went to school, went to church in  Groom. I remember that. We didn   t have a car but I met a girl in school,  and I   d meet my girlfriends, and they   d invite me to go to Sunday  school. But we walked everywhere, nobody came by and picked me up  in a car. I had a little china doll, and I made a wardrobe for her, and I   d  dress her up every Sunday and take her to Sunday school with me. I  liked that. I made a wardrobe for that little doll, and my neighbors  wanted me to enter it in the fair. It was fabulous, just a little tiny  miniature. I remember making a little fur coat.  Were you a pretty good seamstress?  Yes, I could sew. I learned how from Aunt Maude. For just a little while  here in Seminole, I started   well, I have a friend that owns a little dress  24  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  shop. When they   d buy things that needed hemming, I   d just sit there  and hem them on my hands. Then I got to where they   d bring things to  my house. Then it got to where they   d buy stuff that was all too big, and  I made alterations. I didn   t make clothes from scratch. I just corrected  everybody else   s mistakes.  I   m curious about how dusty it was in Pampa. You mentioned Black  Sunday, but how long did that dust last?  Well, the storm, the cloud itself rolled on out by the end of the day, but  the dust was still in the air. It probably settled for the next day or two,  because I remember we went to make up the bed and the dust was just  thick on the sheets. Everything was just covered with that little fine,  misty dust.  And then besides Black Sunday and that weekend, was there some dust  in the air for the next year or two?  Well, out there, if the wind blew, they called it a dust storm, and they   d  say,    Oh, boy, it   s really dusty and windy out there today     I   d say,     Where?    I said,    I   m really used to dust.    But when I got back to  Konawa, no. I didn   t pay any attention to it. I kind of take weather as-is.  A lot of people get up,    Oh, this is an awful day. I hate it  Oh, it   s  cloudy today. Oh, it   s rainy, my arthritis is bothering.    I just thank the  Lord that I live in a place where you can experience all kinds of weather.  Snow, rain, tornados, hurricanes, floods.  We   ve got it all.  Oklahoma   s got it, and I love it. I love the wind. At night, there   s that     you   ve heard of wind that whistles round the corners.  Imitates sound of  wind  And when Aunt Maude and Uncle Robert lived in Groom, Texas,  he had a lot of his folks out there. We   d go every Sunday or so, why, the  family would get together and pack lunches, picnic dinners and go to the  breaks. And out there where they are, that   s the plains. It   s just level, and  the breaks would be a place that would be a little canyon, and there may  be a little stream running through the canyon. Maybe there   d be a tree by  it, and that was called the breaks. I remember going to the breaks  regularly.  And you   d just hang out?  Well, we were just little kids. Uncle Robert would take the wagon, and  we   d chase each other around. We played in the water, just a sandy little  beach. No, we were busy. They said,    To admit you   re bored is an insult  to yourself.     25  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  I agree.  Because you tell me you   re bored with the world right here at your  fingertips? You   re bored? You can   t find anything to do?  Well, when you got married, how long did you stay in Konawa?  Well, we married in December, and my husband got a job immediately  in Wewoka with the civil service. When you join the army or anything,  you go through the draft board. He worked for the draft board, and then  he  typed  his own draft papers, and he went from Konawa to the  service. When he got out of Konawa, in the mean time, I had a real nice  upstairs apartment with Hugh Edward. When Hulett came home, well,  that was our home. And then it wasn   t but about a week or so, he had the  job in Wewoka with the civil service. His friend, L.D. Townsend, he was  a clerk in that office, and he resigned to take another job a little bit  more   it was better or something. He recommended Hulett for his, and  Hulett got that job and stayed in it. Oh, let   s see. When did he get out?  Well, he stayed   oh, I know when he did. When we were in Konawa, he  went to the bank one day, and one of the people in there said something  about,    Hulett, the First State Bank in Seminole is looking for two  service men to hire, on-the-job training program,    and so Emory  Magruder and Hulett Edgmon applied and both went to work for that  bank. Hulett was in banking for forty years, and he loved it.  How long did you live in Seminole?  It all kind of runs together. Let me think. Let   s see, our first   oh,  where   d I live when I    Well, I was living with Roy and Ann, and then  we got an apartment. Let   s see, where   d we live?  Wewoka? Was it Konawa and then Wewoka?  Yes, Wewoka.  And then you moved to Seminole? And then did you live in Seminole for  quite a while?  About seventy years.  Okay. (Laughs) That   s quite a while. And you have one son?  Yes.  And he graduated from Seminole High School?  26  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  And Stillwater,  Oklahoma State University .  And then OSU?  OSU.  And he now lives in     He was in the golf program.  And now he lives in Arizona?  Scottsdale, Arizona, my little boy turned out to be    I called him  Rotunda one day. I thought he never was going to,    My mother, can you  believe?    And he is. He   s fat. He   s heavy. They lived in the wine  country early, way back there, and everybody, they had wine. That was  just part of their life was that Napa Valley. Anyway, I didn   t like that  because they both   they controlled it as far as the alcohol was  concerned, but it sure put weight on both of them. I was used to   my  three brothers were nice, slender, trim. Hugh Edward was nice. He   s got  a lot of pride. He   s a real neat dresser and loves life and everything in it,  and he   s upbeat and an optimist just like his momma, don   t worry about  nothing. He might be concerned, but he doesn   t dwell on it.  And does he have children?  A boy and a girl, Chris and Christy.  When did you first know that Woody was ill?  Well, I don   t know. I think it was so gradual. Well, he came to see us  back in Oklahoma one year, and he went to see Papa. He said,    Papa, I  think I   ve got the same thing that Momma had, because I walk just like  her.    Papa never did tell me that, never did say anything about it. It had  to be heartbreaking, because he   d already lost his daughter, Clara, to  fire, and he almost died from a fire.  And did they know what your mother had at the time?  No.  They just knew she was     They called it insanity. And she ended up in Griffin   s Hospital in  Norman, and then when she   I mean, Momma did. That   s where  27  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Momma was. But they put him in a hospital in, oh, I want to say New  Jersey, but it was part of New York, up in there. Whatever   s in the  record would be right, because I remember him as being   what hospital  was that?  And is that where you went to visit him?  Yes, and I got up there, and I told them all, I said,    Now       When I  went to the home where they had him that Sunday, they had taken him to  a home then, that time, but that was the first time, I guess, I went to see  him. I said,    Woody, what did you   you gave me a name. I had a  nickname that you gave me. Do you remember what that was?        Tinkin.    And then I knew that his mind was all right. So, then the next  time that I took a trip out there and went to see him, I went to the  hospital. He was sitting, and I show him up there in that   that   s the one  that would have been in New York. Way back up there. He says,    I   m  the craziest looking one in here, and I   m the only one with a mind.    I   ve  got that drawn in that. It   s there somewhere. I believe it was in New  York. I loved where the  USS  Reuben James has been bombed right  there. I love that one, right there in the bottom of that one. That one is  California, and that one is New York.  And what do you love in this one?  It   s the sinking of the Great Reuben James, right there it is. See those  bombs hitting it? That ship? And the guitars are just flying.  And it   s Woody and Jimmy     Longhi.  Yes, Jimmy Longhi.  And who   s the other one?  Woody? Oh, Cisco Houston.  Oh, yes. That was the three.  And here he is playing with Lefty Lou.  Yes, and they did. They actually played on   that was a skyscraper, and  they did their program from the top of the skyscraper.  Wow.  28  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  It   s all true. It   s all facts.  That   s fabulous.  I knew those. I mean, I knew enough from   I knew what to draw to  connect. It wasn   t just drawing. It was factual.  Yes, that   s incredible. How many times did you visit him in the hospital?  Well, I visited him one time in that home, and then I visited him another  time in the hospital that I remember.  And did you take a train when you went up there to visit him?  Bus. That   s when I wrote all these little notes, and I   ve got a little  notebook in there, just crammed. People on the bus, they thought I was  writing all the time, and thought I was a checker with the company.  They sure were nice  (Laughter)  Then how did you hear when he passed away?  Oh, we were in constant contact. Marjorie and I talked all the time, and  she kept me posted. Oh, I had had major surgery and was in the hospital  in Oklahoma City. What hospital is that? Might have been the Baptist  Hospital in Oklahoma City, and it came on the news, but they had been  trying to call me at home to tell me, but I wasn   t home. Anyway, I saw it  and heard it on television. When the doctors come in and everything, I  said,    That   s my brother. He just died today.    They couldn   t believe  that.  Did you know his third wife?  Well, that was   no, because he didn   t marry anybody after, did he? I  don   t know.  What was her name? Anneka?  Yes, that was just a flash in the pan, really. She was an English-German  girl, and very, very   well, I shouldn   t say this. (Laughter)  But you didn   t know her much.  No, they had a little girl, and they named her Lorinna Lynn. A long time  ago, there was a    Lori Lorita, La-da-da-dee-dee.    (Sings) She died.  Really?  29  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  She died. She put her up for adoption, and then after that for some  reason, she died.  Well, where was his funeral held, Woody   s?  It was cremation. It wasn   t any service.  Was there a memorial somewhere?  No, he was just a little Oklahoma boy in New York that died. But as  they began to delve into all of his writings and his books and see how  valuable it could be     Well, then in the mid-   90s, the Woody Guthrie Festival began in  Okemah.  It started out a group of local citizens wanted to do something for  Woody, and they formed a little group called W.O.O.D.Y., just  W.O.O.D.Y, W-period-O-period   you know. It goes back to that. They  actually got a little group interested. And then, just being a little town  like that, just like me being in here trying to do something, I have no  connections, I have nothing, and they didn   t have any idea. They were  just trying to recognize Woody for their hometown, and I think they did  a wonderful job. And those ladies, a lot of them are already deceased,  but then Sharon Jones came in the picture, and she was born and reared  there and her brothers, and somebody came to see her. They couldn   t  believe they came to this town. There was nothing in that town to show  that Woody Guthrie was ever a part of it.    I can   t believe that you  don   t        Then Sharon began to think about it, she said,    We   re sitting on a gold  mine. We   ve got one of the world   s greatest people right      not at that  time, but she said,    Woody   s a well known folk singer and done all this  stuff and wrote this song and wrote that song. We ought to be doing  something.    But somebody picked up on that little bitty thing that  happened that kind of wanted to label him a Communist and it didn   t  hold. It did not hold. Like Woody said,    Left wing, chicken wing,  whatever,    it didn   t bother him. I   m so glad that most people began to  see it as just being, you know, the German people were kind of like that.  You take from the rich and give to the poor. Woody was not like that,  but he didn   t believe in somebody on this side of this street having a  mansion and somebody across the street not even have a room to sleep  in. That bothered him, but he didn   t make a to-do out of it. He wanted to  help the down and out because he was a down and outer. He wanted to  use his influence, and that   s where a lot of his song titles come from.  30  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson     She ain   t got the do-re-mi, boys,    heard that at the port of entry.    Go  back to Georgia, Tennessee, but don   t go here without the money.     (Laughs) He just had a knack for writing and poetry. He wrote books,  wrote poetry, he wrote songs, because that   s all he did is write. He was a  writer.  Well, that festival in Okemah has really grown. It   s still going, and     Yes, they   re going on the, this will be, I believe, the sixteenth year, and  it just keeps getting bigger and better.  Have you been every year?  I feel like that I don   t have to do it, I want to. These are good people  doing nice things for my brother, Woody Guthrie. If you love my  brother, I love you. And everywhere I see his name and any time they   re  doing things, I go. I feel like I represent my mom, my daddy, and my  family. We are Woody Guthrie   s family. Now, that   s the way that my  nieces and nephews are now. And Marjorie came right on in the same  way. She just felt it was her duty to take care of Woody, and then she  got Harold Levanthall, who   s a professional manager, and they managed  all of Woody   s stuff from way back there. I sent them everything that I  own, and they took pictures of everything. And when you go to the  museum, you   ll see a lot of my stuff, but I didn   t know it was going to  be famous. I couldn   t have done it. Nora is innovative, she   s talented,  she has contacts with Harold Levanthall. He was a business   see, I  could have still had that stuff rotting in a suitcase under a bed. I   m glad  she   s done what she   s done with it.  And how wonderful, now, that the archives are coming to Tulsa.  Back there. Yes. And when I first did this stuff, my son never has paid a  lot of attention to it. (Laughs) When I started giving my stuff away at  home, he came in, he   s made it clear, right then,    I want all of Woody   s  stuff.    That   s the first time he had ever shown any interest in it.  But it all went to the archives?  Well, I just gave it to them. I mean, they   ve copied it and used it and I  didn   t know. If I   d have had it, no. Nora and her mother have done  wonders, and they deserve every cent. And knowing them, they   ll donate  to some good cause. They   re not going to run out and go crazy with that  money. There   s three kids, Arlo, Joady, and Nora.  Where does Joady live?  31  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  He has an apartment in New York, out there in one of those little tiny  bitty places up there. Joady was a middle child, and he   s a great   what  do you call his guitar? Classical guitar. He   s wonderful. But he never  took to any of that. He just sits back when he   s   he was probably there  somewhere  the other  night, but nobody knew him. But it   s his own  fault, he   s never stepped up to be a part or make himself    Oh, he  managed way back there when he was younger, he just imagined he had  Huntington   s. He was just like his daddy. He   d go see Nora and he   d lie  around on the divan, and she   d look over at him and she said   they talk  like this      My god, Joady, get up from there, you look just exactly like  Woody  Get up off there  Get out of here  I don   t want to look at that.     And that   s just the way he was, just wanted to lie around just like  Woody did. He has a son named Damon, D-A-M-O-N, and Arlo said  he   s real talented. He   s only been married one time and had the one son,  Damon.  Well, since this would be Woody   s hundredth year this year, there   s  celebrations going on all over the world, and we just kicked it off in  Tulsa this past weekend. What was your impression of how this weekend  went?  Fabulous. No words could describe it. I   m in awe.  Really incredible.  The point I was talking to that crowd out there, you know?  Yes, when you were on stage at the Brady Theater?  Yes, I did this to acknowledge with my heart and feeling about  everybody there that I have done show-and-tell programs on Woody I  don   t know how many years. Maydean  Loveday  was my co-pilot.  We   d get in my car and away we   d go  And I did it, at first, for a tank of  gasoline and two dinners because we   d always be performing like  chamber of commerce stuff. Then later, they began to tell me that   I  had them tell me one time that they had a program that they had paid a  thousand dollars for that wasn   t near as interesting as what I had. So,  then I began to think I was traveling quite a bit in my car, and that   s  when I decided to write a book, put it all in a book. It started out to be a  coffee table album of Woody   s letters and everything about Woody, and  all these things I   ve been showing, that   s in this book. All my show-and-tell  stuff   s in this album. We market it this coming July, and the name of  it at this time I understand is Woody   s Road.  Not your choice? (Laughs)  32  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Well, the publishers got a hold of it. I had it titled Treasures From and  About My Brother, Woody Guthrie, with mine and Woody   s picture,  together, the only one I have. They didn   t use that. They took that out. I  think they put it over in the book, but it wasn   t on the cover. I said,    By  Mary Jo Guthrie-Edgmon, Woody called me Tinkin,    because that was  the name he gave me. Oh, when I went to visit that time, I told  everybody, because nobody knew anything. They had never heard that  name before until Woody told them that he called me Tinkin.  So the book is coming out this summer. Do you have some writing in  there or is it everything you   ve given?  It   s very informative. Everything has captions and is labeled, yes. Guy  Logsdon has added quite a historical tribute. (Laughter) I love him, I  love him, I love him. And then D. Jones, my co-pilot in my book has  done all of my computer work, and we   ve worked for eight years on that  book. His wife died, he had a heart attack, he   s had bypass heart surgery,  my husband died, and I   m laid up with two broken hips. (Laughs) I  mean, we   ve had all kinds of rocks thrown in the road, but we just keep  a plugging because, lord, I guess it   s all right that he wants it out there.  And now it   s coming out.  Yes, and I had a man in Colorado that   s come to the plate with all this  helping and doing. Well, and nobody wanted any money. They said,     No, we   re just doing it because we love you,    but I didn   t start out that  way. I didn   t want to impose on people, but I think it   s going to be nice.  They told me they didn   t change   they didn   t take out any of my stuff.  The only thing that was added was at the end, this historical thing that  Guy Logsdon has added. But the other contents are still my pictures and  Woody   s letters and everything.  Well, that will be really neat.  Yes, it should be nice. They sent me a copy of what the cover will be  like and to see if I like it. Yes, I liked it fine, except the title. It   s going  to be fine. I   m blessed. I   m blessed.  How wonderful. Do you have a favorite song of Woody   s?  You know, Woody   s songs told stories and I think I   ve let it be known  that I like them all, but the one that kind of rang my heart strings is  Woody was   he thought that the trash man and the utility, everybody,  garbage, he thought those jobs were just as important as your bankers  and your whatever. He thought everybody was important, and I loved  that about Woody. And the song that he wrote about    Ship in the Sky,     33  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  started out,    My daddy flies that ship in the sky,    and then he comes  along and the next little boy says,    My daddy works in the ground where  they land,    and another one says,    My daddy works on the planes and  keeps them in the air.    In other words, it didn   t take just that one little  boy   s daddy to keep that ship in the sky. It was all the people on the  ground working, mechanics, that kept that   and every little child came  up and said,    Well, my daddy did this,    and,    My daddy did that.    But if  you ever want to hear a good song, that    Ship in the Sky    is one. I like  that. But I like them all.  We   re looking at this painting in your room of Woody done by Charles  Banks Wilson. Was there a ceremony when that was hung in the State  Capitol?  Very nice, and one of the gentlemen, he was a senator   I mean, some of  the politicians leading our state were hosting the crowd. He told me  later, he said,    This is the biggest crowd we   ve ever had for hanging of a  portrait.  And what did they call it?     Hanging Woody.     And was a lot of the family there?  All of us. I call them my entourage.  And you said Arlo brought a bus?  Yes, he had a bus. They traveled by bus. Generally, busses have special  places to sit, drive, it   s a little bit closer, easier than just driving a car.  Like at the thing last Saturday, we all took taxies because it was traffic  and you just couldn   t get around. But those taxi drivers knew where to  go, and we gave them the day ahead.    You be back here tomorrow, and  we   ll use you again.     Yes, that   s smart.  So we traveled by taxi.  What do you remember about the event at the capitol? Just there were a  lot of people there?  Everything.  Yeah? Did people speak about Woody?  34  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Yes. Well, the main thing was just the events, how they unfolded for the  different committees working on these things. And I remembered Betty  Price. She   s my sweet, special friend. I thought I   d see her Saturday, but  if she was in that crowd, I just didn   t get to. I think I had a lot of  personal friends there that just felt like that they couldn   t get through the  crowd. Melvin and Jasmine Moran are so special. He   s a friend of a lot  of these people that connected with all this activity.  Well, I liked what you said when you were on stage, that you probably  know everyone in the crowd through your brother or through a  connection. They were all there to celebrate him, and you felt like you  knew     I said,    I   m sure that a lot of my friends are out there,    because    But  well, I had just never seen any more people. Maybe at a football game,  but I didn   t have to interact with them, but this group, I did. When they  came from Stillwater and the Tulsa paper to do an interview, to me,  these are experiences and my loved ones and my people close and my  friends, I love to open up the doors and invite them to come in, be a part  of it. I want everybody to be a part of what I   m getting the privilege to  do, and that   s the way it was. This man that came yesterday, he lives  right over here somewhere, and he came yesterday and we had a nice,  long visit. He told me all the details about it, because I   m kind of behind  the scene, and I can   t see it from the perspective that you   re looking.  Did you get to meet any of the entertainers?  I already knew John Mellencamp. I had met him in New York for  Huntington   s when they had it. They had a set of my prints, and they  auctioned them off and they came to a thousand dollars, and they  donated that money to Huntington   s. I like to do that whenever they  have fundraisers, I donate a set of my prints. I just remember it was  people, and everybody was happy and smiling big and clapping. I  remember their attitude and the atmosphere in the building was joyful.  Yes, very much so.  I like that.  Yes, that was wonderful. Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, it   s home. It   s everything. Seminole put out a little book called  something, I can   t remember the name of it, but they had asked the  people who were born and reared there and the leading people to write  their stories and they were going to put them in this book. I wasn   t born  35  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  Edgmon  there, but everybody knew Woody Guthrie was my brother and they  kept calling me up. Nancy Phillips, she and her husband have the  Seminole Producer. Their son runs that now. But anyway, she came to  my house, and she would interview people, and I   d always invite her. I  wanted Nancy to be a part in everything, and she was. Then there   s  another lady there that   s big into Woody, and she is my friend, too. Let   s  see, take me back to where we were.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oh, yes, Oklahoma. The name of my story was   well, I kept on, kept  on, until I did write it on something and so many words, and I re-wrote  that thing I don   t know how many times trying to keep it within, I  believe it was 150 words. Now, the last time I re-wrote it, I said,    I   m  going to turn this in. If it   s too long, I   ll just forget it. I   ve written it. I   m  not going to copy it anymore.    Well, it went on and on, and she was  showing excerpts for some of the other stuff that was being written and  other people and nothing about mine. So, I said,    Well, I guess they   re  not going to use it,    and walked along and finally, I got a phone call  from Nancy. She said,    Mary Jo, I   ve got your story here in my hands,  and I don   t know what to do with it. It   s just about the best one we   ve  had and it needs to be shortened, but I don   t know where or how. We  didn   t do anything to it, it   s just like you sent it to us.    The name of it is,     From There      which was Okemah, Oklahoma,    From There to Here,  and all in Between.    And that came out in Seminole Memories is the  name of that book, I believe, and they have them at the Producer office.  It   s nice, and I love that.  What did you write about in 150 words?(Laughter)  Well, I told about how Papa took me from Okemah to Groom, Texas,  Groom, Texas to Pampa, Pampa to Borger, Borger to Konawa, and  Konawa to Seminole, and Seminole and Mrs. Hulett Edgmon, son, Hugh  Edgmon.  Came full circle.  But it was full of good stories. I loved that book. But I believe it was  Memories Shared is the name of the book. And it was published by the  Seminole group, and I guess they sold   they just donated it to the  library or something. We didn   t do it for money.  Well, when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  Woody Guthrie   s sister. (Laughter) No, I have a wonderful son that the  36  Wilson  Edgmon  Wilson  sun just rises and sets in him and my little daughter-in-law. I don   t use  the in-law very often because she   s my daughter. And then my  Christopher and my Christie, that   s their children. And then I have my  sweet husband, our marriage and that, and Ann and Roy. But I started to  tell you, when I knew you Stillwater people were coming, I called Marie  and Ann and Dan, they travel together because they live together. They  came here for the interview, and then I had one or two of the ladies here  that I invited to sit in. I thought,    Well, they need to know when they  read about these things, I was there. I was there.    If I can open a door, I  do. I love to share.  Well, I   ve loved visiting with you, today.  Well, I sure have enjoyed looking at you. (Laughter) You   ve done a nice  job.  Well, thank you.  -------  -------
