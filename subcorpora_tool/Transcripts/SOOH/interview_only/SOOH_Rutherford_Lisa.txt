 Little Thunder  Rutherford  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Monday, October 21,  2013, and I   m interviewing Lisa Rutherford as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at OSU. We   re at the Cherokee Arts Center where  Lisa has a studio and displays her work. Lisa, you also paint and do  Southeastern applique beadwork and have won several First Place and  Best of Division awards, from pottery to feather capes, which I see a lot  of artists picking up on. You   re deeply involved with the Cherokee artists  and community projects, including the  Cherokee  National Treasures  Association, of which you are a board member. Thank you for taking the  time to speak with me.  Thank you.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born right here in Cherokee County in Tahlequah. I grew up on a  dairy out west of town, which now it   s a cattle ranch. I still live out on  the family ranch.  That   s wonderful. So your folks   talk a little bit about daily living over  there.  Well, I grew up taking care of cattle. I learned to work hard on the dairy.  My sister and I both had to work. We had our chores. We had animals to  take care of. We had horses. We helped my dad with the dairy all we  could.  Were either of your grandparents close by?  My dad   s parents lived just up the road until   I think I was five and six  when we lost first my grandmother and then my grandfather. My mom   s  5  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  dad, Joe Thornton, is ninety-seven, ninety-eight years old, and he still  lives out at Park Hill.  What was your relationship with them, either side?  My dad   s parents, we saw them every day. We had a pretty close  relationship, but I was pretty young when I lost them. I still have some  good memories.  Did you get a lot of exposure to the language growing up?  Not a lot. My great-granny on my mom   s side, she tried to teach us. Her  children grew up in the boarding school era, so she didn   t teach them a  language. She said she didn   t want them speaking broken English. Of  course, at that time there was the pressure from the schools to not speak  Cherokee, so she didn   t teach them. Then later I think she regretted it  and tried to teach the grandkids and great-grandkids.  Did you have any extended family members who were artistic?  My grandmother on my mom   s side painted. She   s probably the one that  got me started. She probably stirred my interest in art. She would let me  play with her oil paints, her pastels, and she taught me how to draw  when I was probably, I remember being about five, I think. I have to go  by which house she lived in at the time. She   s the one who taught me  how to draw.  What kinds of things did you draw?  Oh, I think we drew, like, a lot of flowers, plants. I can remember trying  to draw people, animals. When I was young, I drew horses constantly  because I always liked horses, always had horses. I was always drawing  horses.  So what are your earliest memories of seeing Native art?  I can   t really remember the earliest. I saw my grandmother   s paintings,  but they weren   t really Native art. She did mostly landscapes, maybe  architecture, buildings. She did Golda   s old mill. She painted that. I  don   t know. I never really thought about my first exposure. I don   t think  I distinguished it from other art. It was just art.  Would drawing and painting be among your earliest memories of  making art? Do you have any memories before that?  Yeah, probably the drawing and the painting, but I didn   t paint until   . I  6  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  think my grandmother quit painting at some point. I continued drawing,  but I didn   t have paint anymore. Someone gave me some paints when I  was, like, in the fifth grade. I painted a picture, but I didn   t paint again  until 2009. I   m just really learning to paint properly.  What were your art experiences like in elementary school?  None. We didn   t have art. We would get to color, maybe. I do remember  getting to play with finger paints one year, but we had no art classes.  When I was a junior, they finally had an art class at my high school.  Did you learn anything there that you sort of carried with you?  I learned a lot about drawing. I got to take art when I was a junior and  senior. That was my first classes in art, my first drawing lessons. We did  a little bit of pottery; we did a little bit of jewelry. He just tried to give us  the basics of everything, and my art teacher was the only person that  encouraged me to go to college. Nobody at my high school had ever  encouraged us to go, but he   s probably the reason that I enrolled.  Where did you enroll?  I enrolled at NSU  Northeastern State University  three weeks after I  graduated from high school. I was an art major, but my parents weren   t  very happy about that. They wanted me to do something that I could  make a living at. I had an art teacher that also discouraged me because I  didn   t want to be a teacher. It was a ceramics teacher, and he told me  that I wasn   t good enough.  Amazing. (Laughter) So did you hang in there, or did you switch your  major?  I changed my major to office administration. I worked most of my career  doing clerical or administrative-type work.  After graduating.  Yes.  Were you working at the  Cherokee  Nation or     I worked at Northeastern for a little while, and then I worked for the  Nation. I was Chief  Chad  Smith   s executive assistant for ten years. I  got a lot of good experience there, a lot of opportunities that maybe I  wouldn   t have had elsewhere. I learned a lot about Cherokee history, the  current issues, legal aspects of the issues that were going on with the  7  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Nation. Then after that, I spent three years working for Cherokee Nation  Entertainment, and that was not a good choice. (Laughs)  But at some point, you got interested in art again. Can you tell us that  story?  Two thousand four, I was burned out. I was stressed from work.  Working for the chief is a very high-stress job. I just felt like there was  something missing in my life. A friend of mine took me up to Bill Glass     studio up at Locust Grove. They were working on the ceramic art  installation for The Passage in Chattanooga, Tennessee. My friend Ken  introduced me to Bill. Bill shook my hand, and handed me a piece of  fired clay and a brush and some iron oxide and said,    Here, put five  coats on here. Let it dry. Brush it off between coats.    (Laughter)  I was just intimidated beyond belief because this was Bill Glass, and I  knew this was a huge project. I can show you today that piece in the  installation, that first piece. It was a piece of the rattlesnake. I worked all  day, and I loved it. My old background from the ceramics classes came  back to me. I remembered working with the clay, so I picked it up really  quickly. I came back the next day. Bill said,    Would you like to clock  in?    I said,    No, I just want to be part of this project, and I want to learn  from you.     I knew that Chattanooga was a major trailhead for the Trail of Tears, and  I knew that my family had come through that area during Removal.  They had walked on that very spot. I wanted to be part of that, so I  volunteered, and I worked every weekend, every holiday off work.  Every chance I got, I was up at Bill   s, helping with them with that  project.  That   s a great story, and I want to get it straight. Did you anticipate that  you were actually going to work that first day when you were introduced  to it?  No, I had no idea. (Laughs) I just went to see what they were working on  and to meet Bill.  That   s wonderful. So did you go out there with the group?  I went out there for the opening. Several artists went from Cherokee  Nation, and we had a booth, had a big tent for the artists. They had all  kinds of festivities going on. The Chief went, the Council, all the elected  officials. It was a huge festival. I ended up driving a truck and trailer that  belonged to Cherokee Nation, hauling art for several other artists. A lot  of people rode a bus down there. Sharon Irla and I, (Sharon   s a  8  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  wonderful painter) she rode with me, and we drove to Chattanooga and  just had a great time.  It was really exciting for us to see. Sharon also worked on the project,  and it was so exciting for us to see the art installed and see the water that  comes down the steps to the river. Demos Glass, Bill   s son, had a  stainless steel water spider in a reflecting pool, and Robby McMurtry,  who is gone now, Robby had seven stickball player figures that were on  the north wall that were just wonderful. It was really exciting to see all  that in place and to see our names on this plaque on the wall, where we  knew our ancestors had been forced to leave so many years ago.  They listed the studio artists    names, as well?  Yeah, they listed studio volunteers, everyone that had anything to do  with it. We all got our names on there. I was really honored when they  told me my name would be on there. Then Bill said,    I was going to put  Corkscrew       the studio dog   s name       on there, too, but I decided  against it.    (Laughter)  So then did you begin to experiment with your own pottery?  I did. When that project ended, it affected all of us very deeply. I only  worked four months, but the others had been working for a full year,  24/7. Every day, they were working on that. They had been behind  schedule. They said when they had a need, Bill got behind and was  wondering how he was going to get caught back up. The other Lisa,  Alisa Ballou, knocked on his door. She needed some work for an  internship, so she started working with him. Then, they were needing  help again, and Ken just happened to bring me up there. Every time they  had a problem, someone would walk in the door that could solve their  problem. When it was over, we just felt such a loss, such a big  emptiness. I missed the camaraderie, I missed that creative energy, and I  realized that creativity was what was missing from my life. I wanted to  continue, and I saw in the newspaper that Jane Osti was offering a  traditional pottery class.  I   d always been interested in the traditional pottery. I had taken wheel-thrown  ceramics in college, but I didn   t stick with it. I   d never tried the  traditional, so I took Jane   s class. It was, I think, four weeks, two times a  week, and when it was over, I thought,    Well, I   ll just try to continue  this at home.    Jane wouldn   t let me quit. We worked out a deal where I  would work for her in the studio and help her with things on the  computer, things that she didn   t know how to do, in exchange for  lessons. I worked with Jane for a full year in her studio, and she  encouraged me to enter the art shows. She showed me the ropes,  9  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  introduced me to people, and really helped me get started at the art  markets because it   s tough to get thrown into an art market without  knowing what to do, where to go, how to navigate the system.  Right, what a wonderful apprenticeship. Did you actually sort of share a  booth with her towards the end a little bit?  No, I didn   t share a booth with her. I had my own booth. I think  Eiteljorg  Museum of American Indians and Western Art  was the first  show that I did. I went up there all by myself. She was there. We didn   t  travel together or anything. It was pretty scary going to a strange town,  not knowing where the museum was and not knowing where to go  unload or where to park. It was pretty intimidating, but Jane kind of  helped me out, gave me advice, and I sold several things. I didn   t do real  well, but well enough.  Had you entered the competition at Eiteljorg that first year?  I did. I think I got Third Place.  What was your reaction to that?  I was stunned. I was really surprised.  Some intense competition.  Yeah. Yeah, I was happy with it. I don   t think I fully realized at the time  how stiff the competition was up there. I was excited, but then later I  started to realize   . I had won a First Place at the Cherokee Heritage  Center in my first competition, and then I got the Third Place. I learned  very quickly that a Third Place at Eiteljorg carried way more weight  than a first place here locally. (Laughter)  Who were some of the other potters you admired?  Joel Queen. Joel taught me a lot. He taught me the stamped pottery. He   s  an Eastern Band potter and a very dear friend of mine.  How did you meet him?  Jane and I heard about a Qualla pottery conference in North Carolina.  Up until that time, we had been doing Southeast-style pottery, mound  builder pottery, but we didn   t have anything that was specifically  Cherokee. Well, this was a Cherokee pottery conference. Neither of us  had the money to go, and I talked Chief Smith into sending me there to  do research for the Building One Fire book, which he published. Jane,  10  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  someone sponsored her. We barely had any money and we went down to  this conference. I did make a lot of good contacts for that book, but it  was an archaeology conference. There were four potters there, and that  was me, Jane, Joel Queen, and Tamara Beane. By noon, the four of us  had got together and planned a pottery class here in Oklahoma to teach  us that stamped pottery that   s unique to Cherokee pottery. Tamara and  Joel were part of the revival in North Carolina.  The stamped pottery was lost for about ninety years, or all but lost.  When Anna Mitchell revived pottery here in Oklahoma, she didn   t have  wood paddles. She made clay stamps with the same designs, but she  didn   t use the paddles. Joel taught us that technique. The museum in  North Carolina and I think it was UNC at Chapel Hill that partnered with  them. There were a couple of different entities, and they revived the  pottery form and formed a potters guild. Tamara Beane was part of that,  too. She   s another potter that I admire a lot. You can show her a broken  piece of pottery, and she can tell you where it probably came from and  recreate the whole pot. Joel is just crazy talented. He   s taught me more  little tricks, shortcuts, how to fix things. That   s my favorite thing to do  when I go to North Carolina is to go to Joel   s studio and just sit and talk  to him and watch him work. Of course, Anna Mitchell, you can   t not  mention Anna. Most of the potters that are doing this pottery today, if  Anna didn   t teach them, she taught our teachers. She   s just a huge, huge  influence on all the potters.  How did you become interested in Southeastern applique beadwork?  Martha Berry. (Laughter) I loved beadwork, and I had been making  earrings and playing with beads for years. Martha offered a class at the  Cherokee Heritage Center. I can   t remember what the first class   .  Maybe it was a sash. I took the class. I really enjoyed it, but I didn   t  finish my project. She gave another class     You just took it home with you.  Yeah, I just never finished it. I took another class of Martha   s, and I got  to be friends with her. When I was working on that Building One Fire  book, we did a call for art. People were sending me pictures of old  beadwork. After about a year, it dawned on me,    I bet Martha would like  to see these.    I sent her several pictures, and we found some very  significant pieces. One of them, Martha started crying when I sent it to  her. I   m always making her cry. I said,    Here   s this ugly little purse  from NMAI  National Museum of the American Indian ,    and she   s like,     You don   t know what you sent me. You don   t know what you   ve  done.     11  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  She had been trying for maybe ten years to document these little purses  like the one behind me. She knew that Cherokees had them, but she  could not document that Cherokees made them. I sent her an example  from the Smithsonian with the documentation. Her next class she taught  was the little beaded bags, and I was in that class. Martha realized I was  as interested in the research and the history behind it as she was, so she  took me under her wing and threatened to kill me if I ever quit doing  beadwork. Made me learn. She trained me to teach classes, and I still  think she and Meredith  then Director of the Cherokee Heritage Center   tricked me into teaching that first class.  Well, talk about that, your first teaching experience in beadwork.  (Laughter)  I taught the first time   I used to be really shy and never wanted to be the  center of attention. I didn   t like to talk in front of people, and Martha,  she made me teach with her. I was her apprentice teacher. We taught the  class, and she did most of the work, most of the talking. I liked it. I had  fun. I paid close attention to how she taught things, how she  demonstrated. Then the next year, I noticed they had scheduled a  beginning Cherokee beadwork class. I kept saying,    Who   s teaching this  class? Who   s going to teach?    Nobody knew; nobody would say  anything. Then when it came right down almost time for the class, they  said,    Would you teach?    I still think she and Mary Ellen did that.  It was a conspiracy. (Laughter)  I taught my first class, and I really enjoyed it. Learned more about  teaching now, so I think I could streamline things a little bit more.  And then you became interested in the bigger picture of eighteenth- and  nineteenth-century Cherokee clothing.  Yeah, I went to North Carolina. I   d met some of the people, some of the  artists there when I was working on the Building One Fire book. I  worked on it for five and a half years. It took us that long to get the book  finished. I was (what was my title?) managing director, something like  that. My job was to take care of the releases, the paperwork, and to log  all the photographs, and we had thousands of photographs. I went on  most of the photo shoots. I worked with all the photographers, and I met  a lot of artists. I went back to North Carolina for an art market, and I met  a lot of     With your pottery?  Yes, and I met a lot of the artists there, and a lot of people that worked in  12  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  the village. I met the Warriors of AniKituhwa. They demonstrate the  social dances, and they   re the ambassadors for the tribe. When they were  photographing some of the warriors, (the Qualla co-op let us use their  classroom as a studio) just for fun, the photographers and I decided to  take our picture with the guys. I think there were three of them. While  we were posing, my friend, (she had us scooted up so close to each  other) I felt like he was poking me in the ribs. He looked at me and says,     You need clothes like this.    I said,    I would like to have eighteenth-century  clothing    because everyone here wears the tear dresses, and  they   re terribly unflattering to anyone unless you   re a skinny twelve-year-  old.  So I got interested in that, and Barbara Duncan at the Museum of the  Cherokee Indian shared all her research with me and a lot of  information. Some of the guys helped me out. One of them gave me  moccasins. One of them gave me jewelry. This was over a long period of  time. A couple of them went fabric shopping with me, and they were  telling me what fabrics to get. If I started to wear something wrong, they  would come tell me about it.    I   m not trying to tell you what to do, but  women didn   t wear these, historically.    Sometimes I would listen to  them, and sometimes I would say,    Well, they do now.    (Laughs)  So you were making women   s clothing for yourself, sort of, and learning  in the process.  Yeah. I enjoyed wearing the clothing. It was a lot more comfortable and  practical than the tear dress. I   ve learned that clothing helps people feel  more of a connection to the festival. They feel like if they talk to  someone who is dressed in the time period or the cultural clothing, that  makes them feel like they   ve had a closer connection. The tourists enjoy  it. The art market buyers enjoy it. It leads to dialogue, and you can tell  them a little bit more about your history and why you   re wearing certain  things. I just like wearing it at the festivals.  Can you describe   was it a blouse and skirt?  Men and women, both, wore the linen trade shirts. They were shipped  over from England by the bale. They were white linen shirts, long  sleeve, loose fitting, so they   re very comfortable. Women wore a wool  wrapped skirt from Stroud wool, which was made in Stroud, England.  The identifying characteristic of that wool is the white sawtooth edge  where it was clamped into a frame for dyeing. Cherokees used that white  sawtooth as a decoration, as a border on their skirts. Then men and  women, both, wore wool leggings that came up just above your knee.  They were seamed on the side. After 1800, they had center-seamed  leggings, and then the pucker-toe moccasins.  13  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  So at one point, you decided to try a feather cape. Can you talk about  how that happened?  Well, Eastern Band started   I go to Cherokee, North Carolina, at least  two times a year, sometimes five times a year. I have a lot of friends  there. I   m very close to most of the artists, and I had noticed they were  starting to wear the feather capes with their traditional clothing. There  was an exhibit called Emissaries of Peace. It was taken from Lieutenant  Henry Timberlake   s journals. He lived with the Cherokees for two  months in 1762, and then he ended up taking three of the leaders to  England. He described the women wearing these feathered capes, so I  got really interested in that.  Tonia Weavel and I decided we were going to make one. We knew that  the lady who had made the Eastern Band capes was from Pittsburgh and  was not a Native woman. She worked at a museum. She was a museum  professional, and she had replicated one of these feather capes. We  borrowed one that she had made that someone had purchased from her,  and we locked ourselves in the Owen Schoolhouse, which is now a  community building, for six days. We studied that cape. We tried to  follow the thread path. It   s made on a hand-tied net, and it   s contoured to  fit over your shoulders. We thought maybe it was made in pieces and  was sewn together. We tried everything, and we could not make it look  like that.  Finally, on the sixth day, she had to leave early. I was sitting there,  studying that cape. I would look down, I would go to one knot, and then  I would tie it on my net. I would follow to the next one, so I went knot to  knot. It finally clicked how they were doing that. It was very simple, of  course. We just made it difficult. As far as I know, it   s the first one that  was made here in Cherokee Nation using the traditional methods. Now,  Wendell Cochran made some turkey feather capes back in the   70s for  Miss Cherokee. They weren   t made on the net. They were more  contemporary. From what I understand, the Miss Cherokees hated  wearing it because it was very hot. They are very warm. A lot of the  people think the white capes were for the Beloved Woman or signified  status, but from all the research that I have done, as far as I can tell, they  were just simply for warmth. They   re very warm.  Did you use turkey feathers on yours, too, the first one?  No, I used goose feathers. Historically, the women would have used  flamingoes, parrots, parakeets, ducks, geese, turkeys, whatever was  bright and colorful. They preferred the bright colors, and from a lot of  the descriptions, they were very colorful. There were indigenous  14  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  flamingoes. They even used flamingo feathers. I used goose feathers,  and I purchased them already dyed and sanitized. When I add turkey  feathers, I have to pluck those from the hide and clean them myself, so  there   s a lot more work involved in the turkey feathers.  When did you first enter, (I think you called them topper feather capes)  when did you first enter one in a competition, and what was the  reception for that?  About two years ago, and I don   t think I placed. It was really kind of  ignored.  People didn   t know what to make of it, maybe.  Yes. Maybe I got an Honorable Mention.  Was it at Cherokee Homecoming or     Either Trail of Tears or Cherokee Homecoming. I can   t remember. I  think one thing that hurt it was they hung it right beside Roy Boney   s  Raven Mocker painting. Of course, the Raven Walker is a witch who has  black feathers and looks like a raven. They hung my cape right beside it,  which was kind of spooky. I didn   t do very well there. Again, I entered  the one behind me at the Five Tribes Art Under the Oaks. I got Second  Place there. Historically, whatever I enter in that show that does not  place or does not do well wins major awards elsewhere. That   s happened  to me several times, so I took it to Eiteljorg. I took it to Red Earth. I  don   t think I placed at Red Earth. I got a Third Place on a twined bag   twining is an ancient technique for making textiles    no, on pottery that  was imprinted with twined textile. I don   t think the cape placed at all.  And here, it   s all this work with the netting and the...  Yeah, two and a half months, hand-tied net, and each feather has to be  individually   the quill has to be folded over and lashed down, and then  they   re individually sewn on. I think I figured there was 2,100 feathers,  at least, in that cape. I went to Eiteljorg and entered it there in the  cultural items, and I entered some pottery. When I went to pick up my  items, they told me,    They have to stay here for the preview party.     They gave me my papers, and on one of them I saw it had    Best of  Division    on the pottery. I looked at that, and she said,    Oh, you weren   t  supposed to see that. I   ll just tell you, you got First Place and Best of  Division on your pottery.    I didn   t know what I had won on the cape yet.  I came that night to the preview party, and I could not hear the emcee.  The acoustics were terrible. They called the Best of Division winners up,  which I already knew I   d won for pottery.  15  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Then they   re reading down the list, and he said my name again. He said,     Oh, I must have lost my place. I   m repeating myself.    Then he said  something about First Place, and I still didn   t know until I got inside and  everyone was congratulating me. One of the other artists said,    Two  Best of Divisions?    I said,    Oh, no, I just got Best of Division in  pottery.    She said,    No, you didn   t. You got Best of Division in Cultural  Items     I said,    No, I didn   t     I walked over there to look, and there was  a big gold star on the label in front of my cape that said,    Best of  Division.    I ended up getting two First Place and two Best of Divisions  and had been in contention for Best of Show. After the show, the judges  started coming up to me and talking to me about the feather cape and  telling me what they liked about it and why they had chosen it.  Finally, some recognition.  Yeah, I was stunned. I was really, really shocked.  So now when you do the capes, are they mainly for people? You   ve had  them in some fashion shows, right?  Yeah, I had one in the American Indian Alaska Native Tourism  Association Conference in Tulsa. I was asked to be on a panel and do a  presentation at that conference. I met a lady in Santa Fe that invited me  to attend. She said,    Well, you can put some things in the fashion show  if you   d like.    I said,    I   m not really a designer. I only have that one  thing. I have clothing, but I make it only for myself, and obviously my  clothing is not going to fit a model.    I had suggested Tonia Weavel be  another speaker, so Tonia, Margaret Roach Wheeler, and I were the  three on the panel.  When I got there, they were running around with all their clothes. They  were all excited. They were finding models, and Tonia said,    Well,  where   s your clothes?    I said,    I don   t have anything but this cape.    She  said,    I thought you   d wear your eighteenth-century clothes. You   re not  putting it in the show?    I said,    Well, just one thing.    That was when I  found out that we were the fashion show. It was not a show that we were  welcome to put items in. We were the fashion show, (Laughs) and it  started in forty-five minutes.  Oh my goodness. (Laughs)  Margaret had ten pieces, I think, and Tonia had several. They went  around the conference and found models from the conference attendees.  Margaret, her first model up was wearing a simple sheath dress with one  shoulder. She had a shawl over that and a headpiece. When she came off  16  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  the stage, we took off Margaret   s shawl and put my feather cape on her  and took off the headpiece. She went back out again, and no one even  realized it was the same woman. I walked out on the stage and described  my one little piece. Then I left the stage, and Tanya took over. It was  exciting. It got a really good reception. People approached me after the  fashion show and talked to me about it.  Did you get any orders from that fashion show?  I didn   t. I had one lady interested that may order one later, but I am  pretty much booked up with orders right now.  Most of them go to North Carolina?  I had three for Miss Cherokee contestants in North Carolina. Then  Orlando Dugi, who   s a Navajo fashion designer, has taken three of them  so far. He adds a silk lining, a standup beaded collar. He   s a silversmith,  so he does a silver clasp with maybe a stone, and maybe he   ll add exotic  feathers. He   s putting them on the runway with his hand-stitched, hand-beaded  evening gowns. He sold two, I think, and he just ordered two  more. The long one was actually made for him, but I think I need to  make him a different one that fits him a little better because it was  longer, the proportions were different, and I had to experiment with the  netting to make it fit right. I   ve got orders, let   s see, two more. One is  from another artist that lives in Tulsa, and one for a former Miss  Cherokee that lives here. Then he wants two, and then I think I have  another one. I don   t know. I have five orders, anyway.  Wow. So that turned out to be kind of a collaboration, a really neat  ongoing collaboration. What is a museum show that you consider  especially important to your career so far?  Museum shows. I always enter the local shows at the Cherokee Heritage  Center. The Eiteljorg show, I think that was an important one to enter  because I was really surprised after my first time. I went to a show in  Santa Fe at (I can   t remember which museum it was) that Native  Treasures show, and the artists there, several of them remembered me.  That surprised me that they knew me from that one show. I   ve been to  Santa Fe Indian Market twice.  You   ve had a booth there for two years?  Yes.  Just the last two, or     17  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  No, I went in 2010, and I didn   t do very well there. I don   t really care for  the Santa Fe area that much, and I didn   t go back because I came out  way in the red. This year, since this is my first year to be a full-time  artist and I can tell my work has improved a lot, I thought,    Well, I want  to go back and try it one more time and just see if it   s different.    I  partnered with one of my friends from North Carolina who is a shell  carver. It was his first time to attend. He needed someone to kind of  show him the ropes, and we ended up sharing a booth. He did very well.  He won some prizes. I won a prize in 2010, but this year I didn   t have  anything that really   my entry didn   t fit any of the categories.  What was it?  It was a traditional pot and traditionally fired. Everything about it was  traditional, except I purchased the clay. There is no category   you can   t  enter traditional with purchased clay. It was in a (what was it?)     Contemporary Pottery - Other    classification. I ended up with some of  the really well-known potters there, so I didn   t even place.  Did you do pretty well at the Market, though?  Oh, I came within ninety dollars of my goal. I didn   t really expect to sell  much pottery there because it   s a Southwest market and they   re not  familiar with Southeast, but surprisingly my really traditional stuff did  better than the more contemporary.  I noticed you   re involved with the Cherokee Native Art and Plant  Society. I was wondering how many artists are in that group and how  that has impacted your work?  There   s just a few of us that are really active with that, and right now it   s  kind of dormant. We haven   t done a lot. Roger and Shawna Cain and, I  think, Jane Osti were some of the original founders of that group. Their  focus was to work with those that have been named the Cherokee  National Treasures that are mostly the elders, and all three of them are  Cherokee National Treasures. They wanted to help   maybe they go out  and help gather the buck brush or honeysuckle. Roger and Shawna do  river cane, and they were just helping some of the elders gather their  materials and trying to promote them. After that, the Cherokee National  Treasures Association kind of evolved from that, so they   re sister  organizations. I was a volunteer with the Native Art and Plant Society,  and then they asked me to be on the board of the new association.  I   m not a Cherokee National Treasure, but they wanted some non-  National Treasures on the board. They   re focusing mostly on helping the  elders market their work and promoting them. They   ve gone to the tribe  18  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  and asked the chief to allow the National Treasures to have a free booth  at any of the nation   s art shows or events. Sometimes they   ll negotiate to  get them a free room at the Art Market or something. We just advocate  for the elders. We   re trying to record them, interview them, preserve  their knowledge. We do a lot of videotaping and interviewing of them,  and we just have fun.  Sounds like wonderful work. I noticed that you actually have taken a  workshop on art marketing and professional development. Was that  helpful to you, the First Nation   s     Yeah, the First Nation   s Development Fund. That was very helpful.  They held that, I think, in Locust Grove, and they taught us about  marketing our work, pricing, just all aspects. Most artists are terrible  business people. We   re creative, but we   re not good at doing our  paperwork and promoting ourselves. I took that class, and we learned a  lot. I learned a lot from the other artists. It was a really good class, and I  took the follow-up classes to become one of the trainers. I didn   t get  certified because my boss at the time would not let me off work to go to  the certification. I   m still hoping whenever they have a certification  somewhere close by that I can go get certified to be one of their trainers,  which then I would go out with them. When they teach that class, they  always have an artist trainer with them.  That   d be a great thing to be able to do. We   re going to talk a little more  about your creative process and your techniques in a minute, but I was  also wanting to ask you to explain a little about your studio situation  here.  Well, I   d been trying to work out of my home, and I looked around one  day. I had thirty-something pots in my living room, and I have a tiny  house. There was show coming up, and I thought,    I   ve got to do  something. I can   t afford to build a studio.    I   d lost my job. Art was my  only income, so I had to get ready for that show. I thought,    Well,  maybe I   ll go down to the art center and use some of their equipment.    I  thought,    I should rent that studio,    because I knew this had become  available. I came down and talked to them. I said,    I want to rent that  studio for just a couple of weeks.    We talked about it. They said,    We  can do a month-to-month lease,    so I was able to rent this space. I  intended to do it just short term, but then I realized how much more  productive I was. I get up, I come to work, I work here however long I  want. If I get tired, I can go work at home. It   s really helped. It   s  improved my artwork. It   s helped me focus more. It   s just been a really  good deal to have this opportunity to have this studio.  Is it like a twenty-minute drive?  19  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Yeah, about twenty minutes, so it   s close enough   . I enjoy interacting  with other people. We   ve got the Spider Gallery just across the way.  And you   ve got work there.  Yeah, I sell my work there, and they sell fairly well there. This building  has offices in it. There   s two or three more studios right now. There are  classrooms here, so there   s usually other people in here working. It   s  better than working at home. I get that social interaction.  Do you have any other galleries in Oklahoma?  I have work in the Red Earth Gallery in Oklahoma City. They gave me a  show last year, I think, called The Potter and the Painter. I teamed up  with a painter, Jim Van Deman, and the show was supposed to be up for  three months. I went to pick my stuff up, and they said,    We don   t have  anything to put in this case. Can we keep some of your stuff?    I still  have a full display case up there.  Oh, wow. I just wanted to ask you again about that transition. You also  mentioned that you   I don   t know if you left your job or lost your job,  but that decision to make that leap into doing art full-time.  Yeah, I   d lost my job. They did a reorganization and eliminated my job.  I had anticipated that this was going to happen. I was not happy in the  job at all. I knew it was a mistake when I took it, but I worked there for  three years. It was a huge sense of relief to be away from all that stress.  I   d saved my money. I had planned for this, so I thought,    I   ll try doing  art full-time. I   ve always wondered if I could make it as an artist and  always wondered where could I go if I had time to spend all the time I  needed on one particular piece instead of rushing to make the deadline  for a show, and rushing to make some small things just to sell to make  the gas money.    Once I rented the studio, it really turned around for me.  I started selling more; my work improved. Everyone says I am much  calmer, much happier. I don   t look so stressed all the time. It   s really  been a positive thing for me. I   m not making a lot of money, but I   m  getting by.  Doing what you love.  Yeah.  All right. Well, you dig and process your own clay. Is your source  nearby? Is it on your land or nearby?  20  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  No, it   s actually Corps of Engineers land by Fort Gibson Lake, and  that   s where most of the local potters get their clay. The last time I dug  there, the clay quality, it   s not as good. It was never a very strong clay,  but I liked working with it. I broke, like, seven pots in ten days, and I  don   t break pots. This was building them, not firing. I would get them  built up to a certain point, and they would crack. The clay was too weak.  Something had changed in the environment.  Yeah, something was different. Maybe I can find a better vein of it, but  they keep changing it. They keep bulldozing around there and messing  with it, so it   s getting contaminated, I think.  In terms of the clay that you   ve dug that was working well, were you  adding anything to it, any shell or anything?  No, but I   ve started adding something. The last time I was in North  Carolina, I went to a clay company. I forgot to take the sample, of  course, but I told them what was happening, and they suggested a couple  of different additives I could try. I tried one of them, and it worked  pretty well. I was able to get a couple of pots finished with that. I   ve got  a couple that are ready to fire, so we   ll see how it works.  Some of your designs, you talked about the stamps, the paddle stamp  designs. Do you hand carve then? If you have an idea for a design, do  you carve your paddle and do all that?  No, I don   t carve them. I   m not a wood carver, so most of the paddles I  have were given to me by Joel Queen. He   s probably given me five or  six paddles, and then I purchased some of his paddles at one of the gift  shops in North Carolina. I have a few that were carved locally, but the  majority of them were from Joel or Tammy Beane. Her husband, Larry,  had carved some and given to me.  How about textile prints? I noticed some of your designs come from  textile prints.  When I was making the feather capes and I got into tying the nets, I  helped Shawna Cain  start the net for  her big turkey feather cape that  won Best of Show a couple years ago at Cherokee Art Market. It   s on a  twined net base because it   s much larger than what I   m doing. That   s  when I learned twining. I enjoyed it, and I started looking at the old  pottery. I found several online that were found in Tennessee and North  Carolina. They were just broken pieces of pottery, but it had the imprint  of the textile. I replicated several of those, and I   ve been using those to  print some of my pottery with. It   s fun to do. It   s kind of challenging  21  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  because each pot is different. I haven   t really figured out the best way to  get that imprint into the clay.  Yeah, because when we think of textile, we think of something more two-dimensional  but flat. That   s really interesting. Do you do any incising of  designs?  I do incising. Just about anything that was done, historically, I   ve done  it: incising, carving, applique work. I   ve used shells, sticks, pieces of  glass, textile, cords, sticks, peach pits, corn cobs. (Laughter)  I read in one of your online articles that you used to kiln fire your  pottery before you wood fired it. Do you still do that?  I do that as a last resort. If I   ve purchased the clay, usually I   ll kiln fire it  because it makes it stronger when I wood fire it. I don   t have a really  good firing area. I need to get some fire bricks and build it up because of  the wind. The wind is so unpredictable here. If I fire a big pot, I have to  put it inside of a washtub or container to protect it and keep that  temperature constant, or it   s going to have temperature shock and crack.  I kiln fired some first. We had a really wet spring, and I was not able to  do any wood firing. Most of my purchased clay, I went ahead and kiln  fired it. I won   t kiln fire my native clay because I can still enter that in a  traditional category.  You also mentioned in this same article that you prefer to wood fire at  night because it   s cooler, and also during the full moon. Is that for the  light, or is that for another reason?  It just turns out better during a full moon, and I   ve heard other potters  say that. I don   t know what it is, but I realized one time that nine times  out of ten when I   m firing, there is a full moon. Maybe that   s when the  weather conditions are right. It   s more peaceful. I have asthma, so I get  really sick when I fire. It   s physically hard on me to do traditional firing,  and I may have to give it up. I have to burn the fire several hours to  build up a bed of coals, and then I spread it out. Then I set it on broken  pieces of pottery. I   ve got plenty of those. Then I build it up really slow.  By the time I can put the pots in and start building up, it   s usually dusk.  Then it gets very still, very quiet, so I keep adding wood until it glows  red or until I can   t get close enough to put any more wood on the fire. If  it   s inside a container, I can   t see when it glows, so if I can   t get close  enough to add another stick of wood, then I back off. I know it will  reach that temperature, and then I can sit back and kind of enjoy it. It   s  quiet. I can listen to all the animals, the sounds of the night, and relax  because it   s really hard work. I welcome that quiet time.  22  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  You also talked about how each piece would have sort of its own smoke  cloud that would be different from the others. I do love some of the  coloring that you get, especially the white-gray combinations. That   s  kind of a private moment in the process, isn   t it? No one else would see  those smoke clouds but you. The collectors would never see that.  Yeah, it   s really exciting. I usually leave my pots in overnight because it  takes that long for it to cool enough for me to get them out of the fire.  The next morning, I can   t wait to go look at them and see what I got, see  what colors. Sometimes some of my small pieces that are down directly  in the coals, like my little turtles, I   m going to have five different colors  on them, ranging from pink to brown to gray to tan and maybe some  white. You just never know what you   re going to get.  Do you sketch out your designs for your pots before you     Sometimes, not always. My favorite thing is to start incising free-hand  and see what I come up with. That   s my favorite, and it seems like a lot  of the prizes I   ve won have been pots I   ve done that to. Sometimes I feel  like I   ve made the same pot two or three times, but they consistently  win.  How about your beadwork? Have you mainly done purses, women   s  purses?  I   ve done several purses. I   ve done some of the eighteenth-century-style  bags. I   ve done a couple of those, I think. They have less beadwork, and  they   re kind of a different style. I   ve started a bandolier bag, but I   m not  happy with it. I   m going to take out all the beads. I just haven   t reached  that point where mentally I   m ready to rip out all those beads.  At least you can rip them out as opposed to with pots. (Laughs) Do you  sketch out your beadwork designs? How do you choose your colors?  I sketch them out, but when I get ready, I   ll pick out my colors. Like  maybe I   ve got certain colors that have been in my mind, and I   ll just  think about these colors. Finally I   ll pick out my beads, and I   ll lay them  on the fabric. I   ll leave it laying somewhere that I   ll walk by several  times a day, and every time I go by, I   ll look at it. I might move this one  hank of beads next to the other, and I switch them around. When I   m  finally satisfied and those colors are expressing what I want to do, then  I   ll sketch out my design, and then I   ll start beading. It   s more about the  color to me, I think, than design.  What influences which medium you   re going to work on from day to day  23  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  or week to week?  Well, right now, I really want to paint. I   m just dying to paint, but I  can   t. I   ve had art shows. I   m known for pottery, so I needed to get  pottery for the different shows. That   s what sells. I   ve got orders for the  feather capes. I don   t really enjoy making them as much as other art  forms, but I   ve got several orders, and that   s my income. I have to do  those. I think if I could sit down and do whatever I wanted right now, I  think I would paint and do beadwork. I just haven   t done beadwork in a  while, and I really enjoy it.  I   m glad you brought up the painting. I want to get back to that in a  minute. In terms of feather capes, are you able to charge a price that  you feel like you   re able to pay yourself for your time?  I think so. I made the mistake early on of giving discounts to a few  friends. Then I realized I   ve got so many orders here, I need to go up. I  don   t think I was really paying myself enough because there really is a  lot of work. I took two and a half months, working five and six hours a  day on the longer one. I   m getting faster now, but it   s still a lot of work.  Eastern Band people are calling me and ordering them, so there   s not  that many people that are making them.  When you   re doing something like that, either the beading or the capes,  do you listen to music, or watch TV, or     It depends. It just depends on my mood. Sometimes I want to listen to  blues. Sometimes I want old blues. Then sometimes I want loud rock  music. There might be days when I just want total silence. I might not  even turn on the TV, radio, anything.  Well, talk about your painting a little bit because I know that that has  been an interest of yours.  Yeah, in 2009, Sharon Irla taught a painting class. I took her class, and I  painted a friend of mine, who is also a painter. I realized pretty soon that  that was kind of a mistake because I was so worried about what he  would think. He is a painter, and that was a little stressful. We were  painting little five-by-five miniatures.  Was it a portrait-type thing?  Yeah, and everybody else is painting people out of magazines or  something. I always do that. It   s like I always challenge myself. If  someone here is painting a flower, I   ve got to paint a whole forest.  (Laughs) At first, I hated it. Bill Glass was in the class with me. Both of  24  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  us just,    Blah, I just hate this  I   m sticking to clay     Bill did really well,  too. He painted his late brother. Mine turned out pretty good. I   m still  not happy with it. I still paint on it now and then. I took her class again,  as if I didn   t get enough the first time, and I painted a picture of a little  girl from a 1938 photograph. She was actually in a group shot, but I  cropped her out. I just loved her expression. Something about that little  girl really spoke to me, so I painted her. I did pretty good. I won a  Second Place ribbon on the painting.  At which show?  At Cherokee, North Carolina. I think it was the Festival of Native  Peoples Art Market. At that point, they were separate art markets,  separate events, but at the same time. When I went to pick up my  painting   there   s no awards ceremony down there. They open the door  and say,    Okay, go see what you won.    I went to pick up my painting,  and I think I had a piece of pottery in there. My pottery had a ribbon, so  I picked it up. I started looking for my painting and someone said,    It   s  over there.    The only two paintings left on the table were Gary  Montgomery   s forty-eight-by-forty-eight-inch painting that had just won  Best of Show at Red Earth, and my little five-inch painting was right  beside it. (Laughter) Gary won First, and there was a red ribbon.  I thought,    That can   t go with mine. No, he didn   t get Second on that  because he won Best of Show. Obviously, he got First.    There was no  other painting, so I took the ribbon, but I still wouldn   t put it out. This  was a show that Joel Queen was one of the organizers of. I took it to my  booth. Joel came by, and I   m like,    Joel, did I really win this?    He said,     Yes, you did     So I put it out, and a few minutes later one of the judges  came up and said,    How much for that painting?    I hadn   t even thought  about selling it. I would have taken it home and painted on it some more.  I didn   t like the background. I said,    I don   t know.    He said,    How  much? I want to get it before the other judges get here.    I said,    Two  hundred dollars?    Before I could blink, he was gone with my painting,  and I was standing there with two hundred-dollar bills in my hand.  (Laughs) You may need to do some more painting.  I did the third one. It was a friend of mine. He was going through a  rough time. He   d lost his wife and lost his sister. I had a beautiful  photograph of him. He   s got his head shaved, he   s got the scalp lock,  and he was in his eighteenth-century clothes. I just loved the way the  light was on his face, so I painted him. That was my best painting; it was  my third one. This was the first time I had painted since I was probably  in the fifth grade. I spent a lot of time on his painting, and I felt like I  finally was starting to learn a little bit. I entered that in a show down in  25  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  North Carolina, and I got First Place on it. I gave him the painting. It  was in a calendar, too. He was very proud of that. He liked it. I took his  picture holding the painting and the ribbon and everything.  I   ll have to look for that. Are these oils that you   re working in?  Yeah, I love oils. I think they dry too fast. People say they dry slow. I   m,     I   m still working. I   m still blending.     Do you tend to work on multiple pieces concurrently, too?  Oh, yes, I   m very ADD. (Laughter) Yeah, I work on three to five pots at  a time, and I jump back and forth from, maybe, beadwork to pottery.  Like today, I   m working up some clay, but at home, I   ve got a net that  I   m working on for a feather cape. I need to work on some jewelry. I   ve  got some Christmas-type shows coming up, so I need to make   . It   s  always eighteenth-century style or Mississippian style. I   m making some  freshwater-pearl necklaces with copper. I might make some more of the  twined bags. I hop back and forth from one to the other.  You   ve talked a little bit about some of the research that you   ve done.  Do you find you don   t have to do so much research nowadays because  you   ve got a lot of things in your head, or     I probably do more because I   m more interested in it. I keep learning  new things, and the 1700s just fascinate me. I love to research the  clothing. I   ve been to Colonial Williamsburg. A friend of mine got me  access to their costume department. Another friend of mine, he makes  regalia, and he makes some of the clothing. We got into the costume  department, and they gave us a tour and showed us around. Then he  started looking through a doorway.    Look in here. Can we go in here, I  wonder?    That   s where they were actually doing the sewing and the  mending because they costume (I can   t remember how many hundreds)  like twelve hundred interpreters, twelve hundred characters. Some of   interpreters  do more than one  impression . They   re always mending,  repairing, making new things, replacing.  The lady that gave us the tour had moved on, but another lady saw him  looking through the doorway. She recognized him as one of the dancers  because this was Cherokee Week. The Warriors of AniKituhwa go up  there and dance on the Palace Green where the Cherokees danced in  1762 before they went to England. She recognized him, and she said,     I   ll take you in there.    She ended up taking us to other areas that  weren   t really open to the public. They even allowed us to purchase  some of the clothes. He bought a couple of waistcoats. That   s another  interesting thing about it because that time period, Cherokees were  26  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  mixing their clothing styles with English items, maybe military coats,  boots, hats, anything new and different. It   s just like now. You see  something new and think it   s really cool, and you want that, too. He  bought a couple of the waistcoats. I   m still regretting that I didn   t buy a  skirt I saw.  What a great experience.  Yeah. The next day when the Festival started, several of the artists were  demonstrating different arts, and they had told me at one point that I  could come and demonstrate. Then they said,    No, we can   t pay you  because it   s only Eastern Band.    He said,    I can   t let you demonstrate  because they might think there was some deal made,    or something. I  didn   t quite understand. When we got ready to go, I was traveling with  my friend who was one of the dancers, and he was also demonstrating  beadwork. His brother was demonstrating quill work. I partner with his  brother a lot and share booths with him at art markets. We got ready to  go, and he said,    Take your bag you   re working on to demonstrate.        Well, they told me I can   t demonstrate.    The brothers looked at me,  they said,    You are with us. You take that bag and demonstrate. You   re  sitting with us.    (Laughter) I took it, and then they later thanked me for  coming and demonstrating. I got to be the first Cherokee Nation artist to  demonstrate at Williamsburg.  That is very cool. Of course, your creative process is probably different  for different media, too, but in general do you keep a notebook that you  write ideas down in, or how do you     I have scraps of paper everywhere with notes and ideas, napkins, papers.  (Laughter) I have all kinds of little notebooks. I can   t manage to get  them in my sketchbook for some reason. Sometimes I do go back and  create them. It might be years later that I   ll start something and then  decide to finish it. It might be several years later.  Do you like to work during the day or at night? Again, it may depend.  It just depends. I   m not really a morning person. I tend to start  working   I usually come into the studio around noon, maybe eleven.  Sometimes I work at home. If I have to work on my computer, if I need  WiFi, I come here. I don   t have internet at home. I   m able to use the  WiFi here. I   ll work on all those things that take up time, other than  creating. I like working into the evening. I don   t like to stay here late at  night by myself. It   s kind of creepy in here. We hear things, and things  move around. (Laughter)  Well, looking back on your career so far, what   s been a fork in the road  27  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  or a kind of turning-point moment?  Meeting Joel Queen was one of the turning points, and I think losing my  job and getting the studio here has been a big one. The first big one was  meeting Bill Glass and getting started on that Chattanooga project. I  think that   s really exciting to go back and visit that and see the artwork  that we created.  Have you been back a couple times?  A couple of times.  That   s great. What   s been one of the low points in your career so far?  Going to the shows where you don   t sell anything, sometimes it seems  like everything just goes wrong. Maybe it rains, or you don   t win  anything, you don   t sell anything. Then you   re out hundreds of dollars  and have that long drive home. That   s been pretty bad. I guess around  2010 when I left the Chief   s office and took that other job, it just killed  my creativity. There for two and a half years, I didn   t do any work to  speak of. I just didn   t have time. I was so stressed, I didn   t have any  creative energy. It was really nice after I lost my job to get that back. It  took a while. It was like I had to learn to work with clay again.  What   s been one of the high points?  Probably the two Best of Divisions at Eiteljorg. (Laughter) Actually, I  won three Best of Divisions this year, so it has been a good thing to have  this studio.  The third one was     The Southeast SEASAM, the Chickasaw Nation Southeastern Art Show  and Market.  Pottery, right?  No, the feather cape again. The feather cape has won two Best of  Divisions.  Is there anything we   ve forgotten to talk about or anything you   d like to  add before we look at your work?  No, not really. (Laughs)  Okay, well, we   re going to take a look at your pottery, your cape, and  28  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  some of your beadwork.  Okay.  All right, so this is one of your topper feather capes.  Yeah, this one was a longer length than the historic ones. The men wore  very long feathered capes or mantles, historically. This one was  actually   I made that for Orlando Dugi. He wanted to wear it on the  runway. I   m not sure if he   s going to take it. I   m not real happy with the  fit. This is goose feathers on a hand-tied net base, and then I   ve added  some of the turkey breast feathers around the top. I wanted them to stand  up a little bit like a little collar.  Yeah, you can see the turkey feathers standing up.  They   ve got the shiny copper color on   I really like that iridescence and  contrast. My goose feathers are turned upside down. That   s the  underside that shows. The underside is more shiny, and it has that luster  on it.  Yeah, they pick up and reflect the light just beautifully. Cool. So talk  about your beaded bag a little bit.  That   s beaded on eighteenth-century wool, trade wool, and glass seed  beads. It   s got a calico lining. The white flower, I was kind of inspired  by a Cherokee rose. It   s got the leaves with the lighter green accent. A  lot of the Cherokee beadwork was outlined in white. Shortly after 1800s,  Cherokee women would have carried those. The clothing style from that  time period   before that, women wore the full petticoats that had the  slits in the side. You wore your pockets on a string around your waist.  They weren   t attached to your skirt. When the style changed, the  silhouette became slimmer and the waistline higher. You no longer  could wear your pockets under your skirt, so they started carrying the  little purses.  And you   ve got one of your twined bags next to it, interesting.  Yeah.  Okay, what can you tell us about this pot?  That pot, the shape would have been used as a cooking pot. It has an  incised design. I just free-handed, started carving. The rim of it, the  applique rim strip, that is unique to Cherokee pots. Actually, I   m finding  that some of the Southwest tribes have that type of applique, but  29  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  Little Thunder  Rutherford  archaeologists that specialize in the Southeast pottery refer to that as a  Cherokee rim. It   s just an applique strip that has a notched edge. It kind  of helps to press it into the clay when it   s damp. It would   ve been used  for a cooking pot.  Did you give it a title? Do you title your pottery sometimes?  If I enter a show I do because a lot of times I think the title helps. I still  think that one of my pots, (it was called Still the Waters Run after Angie  Debo   s book) I still think that title helped it win prizes. I won, like, four  blue ribbons on that pot, and someone bought it and spoiled my little  fun. (Laughter)  I   m going to try to zoom in on a couple of your turtles here, and fish.  Tell us a little bit about those.  Those turtles are just a little fun thing that I enjoy doing. The one on the  back left is stamped with one of my pottery paddles. The one in front of  that with the spirals, that   s from a little shell. It was actually an earring  someone gave me made out of a shell. I immediately made it a pottery  stamp.  Made a great design.  Some of the others are just free-hand, incised designs.  You can see a little bit of the multicolored iridescence.  Yeah, I fire those directly in the coals, so they really get the hottest part  of the fire. They   re against those coals longer, probably, and they get  more vivid coloring.  Well, thank you very much for your time today, Lisa.  You   re welcome. This was fun.  -------  -------
