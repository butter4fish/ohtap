 Finchum  Haught  Today is June 25, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University Library and we are doing an oral history project  featuring Henry Bellmon. I   m in Washington, D.C. today with Bob  Haught and he   s going to tell us a little bit about himself and then we   ll  get into his career path with the Bellmons. So thank you for joining me  today.  Happy to be here. I   m a native Oklahoman, born at Lawton, Oklahoma,  back in 1930. And my folks moved right away to Marlow, in south  central Oklahoma, and that   s where I grew up. Graduated from high  school, went to college at Southwestern State in Weatherford, and then  off to the Army for about eighteen months. Called up with the National  Guard, with the 45th Infantry division, Oklahoma Thunderbirds. After I  got back, I returned there for one semester, and then transferred to the  University of Oklahoma, where I got a degree in journalism in 1954.  Was lucky enough to get a job with the United Press, which later  became United Press International, UPI. I was there about eight and a  half years.  At the time that I finally left UPI, I was the bureau manager. I had been  a number of things on the staff, but basically a correspondent. I had  covered Oklahoma politics and government, legislature, and then later  on a broader range of coverage. In the course of that coverage, I met  Henry Bellmon. I met him, actually, at a cocktail party, which was kind  of unusual, since he was a teetotaler. It was hosted by John Tyler of  Bartlesville, an oil man who had an awful lot to do with Henry getting  into politics, and he did it specifically to let Henry and Shirley, his wife,  meet members of the press. It was a very good thing to do, and it reaped  rewards later on. At that time, Bellmon had been elected the Republican  state chairman, and he was just a wheat farmer. He had served one term  in the legislature, and was not re-elected. I don   t know what he thought,  whether it was the end of his political career or not, he never did say, but  5  he didn   t lose his taste for politics, of course. So we met there.  Then I did cover him as he, later that year, became a candidate for  governor. I did cover his campaign, and wrote a number of stories about  it, and did some travelling with the campaign. After he was elected, as  Oklahoma   s first republican governor, it wasn   t clear immediately  whether he was going to have a press secretary. I guess he   d been on the  job maybe a couple of weeks when one Saturday he called me and asked  me to come to his office, and I did. Being a Saturday, we were, I think,  the only ones in the Capitol Building. We had a good long conversation,  and I don   t remember exactly how he asked me if I   d be interested in the  job, but at any rate, I did accept. He also, at that time, did talk about  some of the problems that he was facing, not from a standpoint of  complaining, but just by saying that there were things that he had needed  to deal with so I would know what I   m getting into. Being the press  secretary for the first republican governor was not exactly the easiest  job.  But I should say at this point that Bellmon was not a hard partisan  republican. He knew that Oklahoma, at that time, was a very heavily  democratic state. He knew he had to get support, a wide range of  support, and so he made lots of friends over the state with democrats.  His opponent was a wealthy developer from Midwest City, Bill  Atkinson, who just didn   t relate to everyday people, I guess is a way of  putting it, and Henry Bellmon did. I mean, he was just a plainspoken  farmer who believed in hard work. He was straight talking and the  people liked that. And I think they were also ready for a change from  one-party control.  I was with him on the governor   s staff for about two and a half years,  and then he named me the State Economic Opportunity Coordinator,  which was to coordinate Oklahoma   s participation in the War on  Poverty, which was during the Johnson administration. I held that job for  about two and a half years, and by that time it had carried over into the  Dewey Bartlett administration. After that time, I did a short project for  University of Oklahoma Extension division, and then joined the  Bellmon for Senate campaign as the publicity director. When he was  elected then in 1968, I followed him to Washington, D.C., and stayed  with him on his staff for two terms, the first term handling press  relations, in addition to some other things. I had a little hand in some  legislation, but I was primarily the one who was the contact and  information person. The second term, his administrative assistant Drew  Mason had come back to Oklahoma to work in the Oklahoma City  office. So I became the administrative assistant, and that was the chief of  staff and held that job until he decided to not run for a third term and  came back to Oklahoma. As you know, he then, of course, ran for  6  governor again.  I did not return to Oklahoma. I stayed in Washington, and for about five  years, I worked as an independent editor. I formed my own little  company and did various kinds of writing and editing and that sort of  thing and until    87 when I was asked to be an editorial writer for The  Oklahoman, and back then it was The Daily Oklahoman, in the  Washington Bureau. That suited me fine because I, in the meantime,  established some other kinds of roots, and really preferred to stay in this  area. So that worked out fine. I wrote editorials, and I started a political  humor column. I volunteered to do that. Mr. Gaylord, Edward Gaylord,  like his father, was known as a person who   s a little tight fisted with the  money, and when I told him that I would do it for no extra pay, well then  they said,    Well, okay. Do it.    (Laughs) I had to have a little fun. I  mean, writing editorials can be pretty boring, although I tried to inject a  little humor in the editorials.  The column was called Potomac Junction and it was just really poking  fun at the high jinks that goes on in Washington. When I started it, it was  only a weekly column, once a week. I thought,    I will never run out of  material for a weekly column,    and sure enough, I didn   t. I ended up  writing that column for eighteen years, until 1997. After I retired from  The Oklahoman, from full-time work in 1995, I continued to write the  column. It appeared on the Op Ed page until I voluntarily decided to  suspend it. Since that time, I   ve kept my hand in as a writer. Being  retired doesn   t necessarily mean you quit working, but you have more  control of your time, and so it   s been a good life.  I, unfortunately, did not have regular contact with Henry Bellmon after  he left this area, so I missed out on a lot of the get-togethers. The  Bellmon staff, both in the governor   s office and the senate staff was a  very close-knit group. They had their loyalties to him and to each other.  It was a lot of camaraderie, and even to this day, after Henry died, they  remain in touch with one another in various degrees. I think that   s very  unusual, and I don   t know of any other instance, I   m sure there must be  some, but I just don   t happen to know.  After Bellmon went back to Oklahoma, I did stay and worked on another  senate staff. This was Charles    Mac    Mathias of Maryland, another  republican, but of a totally different philosophy. Mathias was a pretty  liberal senator, although Bellmon, of course, was liberal on some things.  I guess if he was strongly conservative, it would be more of a fiscal  conservative. As history shows, of course, some of his biggest, well, not  challenges, but some of the toughest things he did was to vote in favor of  school busing in Oklahoma City, or, that is, he came down on the side of  being for it, and also supporting the Panama Canal Treaty, which were  7  Finchum  Haught  both issues that were not popular with the majority of Oklahomans. In  fact, the Oklahoma newspaper even editorialized on the Panama Canal  treaty and referred to him as    Benedict Bellmon.    The funny thing about  it is, though, that he and Edward Gaylord were very good friends and  quail hunters together, so they didn   t lose their friendship, but they  certainly differed on that political issue.  The time with Henry Bellmon was a valuable experience, a memorable  experience. I jokingly say I had the misfortune to work for an honest  politician, so I didn   t make much money but it wasn   t the kind of job  that I went into to make money. I also say, somewhat kiddingly, that I  worked for the government long enough that I could afford to go back to  the newspaper business, because it certainly doesn   t pay very well.  (Laughs)  Let   s back up and talk about the very first campaign that you helped  with with him.  Well, the first campaign I helped with was the 1967-   68 campaign for  the Senate. I might just say, in reference to his first campaign for  governor that, although I was not on the campaign staff, I got to know a  number of the campaign staff people. Wayne Mackey, who was his  campaign manager, worked for the Oklahoma City Times, I think   well,  one of the other papers. At that time, they had The Oklahoman and they  had The Times. Wayne and I were good friends, and we had written  some Oklahoma City Gridiron shows together. After Wayne had gone to  the campaign, we were out one evening, I think it might   ve been after a  Gridiron rehearsal or something, and we got to thinking that Henry  needed a campaign song. So between the two of us, we put words to     Yes sir, that   s my baby,    and that was the campaign song for his first  campaign for governor. It was,    Yes sir, we   re for Bellmon, must have  Henry Bellmon,    that sort of thing.  But the senate campaign, well, we were running against   we, of course,  referred to him as an    entrenched    democrat senator   Mike Monroney,  A. S. Mike Monroney. Mike Monroney, interestingly enough, had been  a newspaperman. He worked for the old Oklahoma News, and Wayne  Mackey, it just so happens, had played the part in the Gridiron. He had  been Monroney in the Gridiron. But, Mackey wasn   t involved in that  campaign. That was later on. Monroney had served three terms, I  believe, maybe more. He had been there a long time, and he had really  lost contact with Oklahoma, and Bellmon, of course, made an issue of  that. He was more familiar to Oklahomans, and my job as publicity  director was to get the word out.  I   ve always looked at my job as press secretary, or any other, as making  8  sure the people get the information, and try to give them as much  information as you can. Of course, any public official is not going to  want to tell everything he does and knows, but Bellmon was not the type  to conceal very much. He was very, very candid, and sometimes too  candid for his own good. He would get to reminiscing and talking about  campaigns, and he would tell things that probably he shouldn   t have  told, but they loved him for it. I mean, the press loved him, the people  loved him. In fact, we did a column we started in the governor   s office,  and the title of it was    Plainly Speaking,    and it was just that. It was  funny at times, it was interesting and entertaining at times, but a lot of  times, it was strictly for information about things he thought the people  ought to know, and what he was involved in. That column ran through  all the time he was in public service. Various people helped him with it.  He wrote an awful lot of it, but of course, there were times when you  needed to do a draft, and then he can add his own touch to it.  His winning point, as far as a politician and just being generally liked,  was that he would look you in the eye and give you straight talk. He was  honest. Some of his campaign foes tried to make it appear that he wasn   t  always honest. They tried to accuse him of chicanery, getting a farm  home loan, and things like that. He was just really an honest,  hardworking individual, and the campaign seemed like it went pretty  quickly. We had a very good staff. It was some people from the  governor   s staff, Drew Mason was his administrative assistant as  governor   he was the campaign manager. Don Ferrell, who was a  newspaperman from Chandler, and a very good, close friend of the  Bellmons, had been a state senator in addition to running the newspaper.  He came on the campaign staff, sort of in charge of issues and that sort  of thing, and actually, he was in charge of the field people. We had some  other staff that would go out over the state. We had a couple of youth  contacts, Charlie Waters and Caroline Farha. Caroline, I think, was the  collegiate and Charlie was the high school type. It may have been vice  versa, but I think that   s right. Charlie, just incidentally, in later years,  worked for Bellmon in his second term as governor, and went to the  State Department of Public Welfare, where I think he still is.  We got some breaks. One time, Mrs. Monroney came to the state and all  she could talk about was that she just couldn   t find any decent clothes to  buy in Oklahoma, and that she had to buy her clothes in New York or  places. Well, you know, that didn   t go over well, so they made some  mistakes. Basically it was a situation where it was really just kind of  Monroney   s time. He had served long and done an awful lot for the  state, and we, of course, gave him credit for that.  Kind of an interesting personal thing, and this doesn   t have anything to  do with Bellmon, I had said earlier that I worked for UPI. My boss was  9  Finchum  Haught  Carter Bradley and before I left there, Carter went to work for U.S.  Senator Robert S. Kerr. He went on his Senate staff, and that   s how I  became bureau manager. I succeeded Carter. Kerr died on the first day  of January of 1963. Bellmon was elected in    62 as Governor, and  succeeded J. Howard Edmondson. J. Howard Edmondson, as history  will tell you, arranged with George Nigh, the lieutenant governor, to  appoint him, Edmondson, to take Kerr   s seat. So George Nigh then  gained his reputation as the nine-day governor. He served for nine days  as Governor between J. Howard Edmondson and Henry Bellmon. And it  was a lot of kidding about what all he did in those nine days. Of course,  then Nigh ran for Governor later and served two terms and that was that.  Carter Bradley, after Kerr died, went to Monroney   s staff, and so when  we had the campaign, he was on one side and I was on the other. Two  former UPI bureau managers on opposing sides. There were some ugly  things done, but we stayed friends. On election night we both had our  campaign election celebrations in the same hotel, and so we met in the  hall and shook hands and all that, but Carter   s wife never forgave me.  (Laughs) Carter died not too long ago. He was a great guy, and I owe a  lot to him. That was just a little aside. That was about it for the senate  campaign.  And then you moved from Oklahoma to D.C. at that time?  Went to DC, in    69 and the first thing we had to do was get settled. Not  everybody in Congress, in fact, it   s more common on the House side, not  everybody takes their campaign staff. There are some good reasons for  that, because the campaign is one thing, and serving in an elective  position, and serving the people, the public, the constituents is different.  But Bellmon had a great loyalty for his staff, so as many as could go to  Washington, for all intents and purposes, he offered jobs to. So there  were a good number of us that did go to Washington. Of course, you are  assigned office space, but right away you have to take whatever is  available. So we were actually crammed up into a space. We shared a  space with Senator Ted Stephens, who   s still around, for a short time.  Then we finally did get our office suite in the Russell Senate Office  Building, named after Senator  Richard  Russell.  It   s a lot different now. Back then that was the only office building for a  hundred senators. It was very cramped. Well, I take that back. I think the  Dirksen Building had been built. I   m sorry. The Dirksen Building had  been built, but then the one that came after that, the Hart Building, was  much later. Now there are three Senate office buildings for a hundred  senators. Back then there were only two. The space we had was  essentially one very, very large room which the preceding senator had  used as his office. Bellmon looked at it and he said,    I don   t need this  10  much space.    So he took a smaller room for his office and used that  large room and put a number of desks in it. It was just one big open  room, and you had desks around it. There was hardly any privacy. And  then there were a couple of other much smaller rooms.  Later on we moved to the Dirksen building, and it was essentially the  same thing. We had a little more space there, but it was not designed for  office space. In other words, you had to create your own office space  with dividers and that sort of thing. The governor   s office was much  better. J. Howard Edmondson had done a good job of renovating and  dressing up the governor   s office. It was a very nice office. But anyway,  we made out, but it was not conditions that were really conducive to a  lot of joy. First of all you   re working long hours, and you   re working  hard. I tried to keep the morale up as best I could.  We had a number of young people who had come up from Oklahoma,  away from their state for the first time, and in a very large city. It was  challenging too, because it was a big city. It was difficult to make the  adjustment and all. So I would, on occasion, write some silly parodies of  different things like Charlie Waters, for example. Charlie was a little  short guy with lots of energy, and he was just always running around,  talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. He was going to leave and go back to  Oklahoma. So when he left I did some lyrics to    The Man Who Never  Returned,    the man who got lost in the Boston train. Charlie was    The  Man Who Never Runs Down.       Charlie, you can   t get ahead of Charlie  because he   s the man who never runs down.    That   s just an example.  The Bellmon family, though, was so warm and loving. The staff was  always welcome in their home. They would have dinners for the staff,  and that was also very good. And the same thing back in Oklahoma. We  used to go to the farm and have a day up there with them. When he was  out of office they would continue to do that.  The beginning years in the Senate, of course, Bellmon was in the  minority. He did manage to get committees where he had good enough  knowledge and background to serve on, one, Agriculture, of course,  being a farmer, the Energy committee, because he knew as much about  energy as probably a lot of other people in the Senate, living in an  energy state, and a lot of his good friends were with energy companies.  He was on both those committees, but he really hit his stride in his  second term when he was on the Senate Budget Committee. He really  developed quite an interest in the budget. He applied himself to it, and  he probably left his mark there, although it   s not the kind of mark that   s  all that visible. And it lived on after him.  I   m kind of jumping way ahead here trying to give an idea of his impact  in the Senate. The budget committee had its own staff, so it was separate  11  from the senator   s personal staff, and by personal staff I mean they did  the job that the senator needs to do for his constituents. The budget  committee staff had a woman on the minority staff named Carol Cox,  and Carol Cox, after Bellmon left office, formed the, I think it   s called  the Committee for Responsible Budget. I   m pretty sure it   s still in  operation today, and through the years, they have had quite an impact on  the budget process. So that, I guess, as far as his lasting legacy or  impact, as far as a member of the Senate, it   s probably in the area of  budget.  Bellmon, like many governors, did not enjoy being in the Senate as  much as being Governor. There were lots of, of course, times that he  enjoyed. Enjoy really isn   t the term. He felt good about certain things  that he was able to do in the Senate, but he was also very frustrated  because instead of being a chief executive and being able to say,    Do  this,    and it   ll get done, he had one out of a hundred votes. And being in  the minority, it made it even less of an impact. I think, even when he  was up for re-election, he really struggled to decide if he really wanted  to stay a second term, but he did. I think he was persuaded by a number  of people that he should do that. And it so happened that his opponent  was Ed Edmondson, who was Howard Edmondson   s brother, who had  been in Congress. Ed Edmondson was in Congress before Howard was  Governor. Howard was the younger kid brother. Ed was the democratic  nominee, and it was a tough campaign.  This was 1974 and Bellmon was associated with Richard Nixon. He, in  fact, for a short time back there, had been his national campaign  manager for just a couple of months, I think. That was the Watergate  years and so it was tough. Bellmon did win, but by a slim majority. I  can   t remember the number of votes now, it   s been too long. But  Edmondson challenged the election even though the secretary of the  Tulsa County Election Board, Danny McDonald, a democrat, came  down on the side of Bellmon, and against his party friends. Edmondson  took it to the Senate, and so the election results remained in dispute  while the Senate Rules Committee, chaired by Howard Cannon of  Nevada, who was a very, very strong partisan Democrat, Howard  Cannon did everything in the world he could to prolong this, and he  dragged it out for, I think it was, at least eighteen months. I can   t  remember now exactly. That   s a matter of record, so I don   t have to be  held to that. And that had to have an effect on the man, because you  didn   t know whether you were going to be able to stay or not, and just  the uncertainty of it. The outcome was pretty much a foregone  conclusion, I mean, the facts were all on Bellmon   s side but you still  couldn   t count on it. I can   t say it created hard feelings between him and  the other senators, because he could get along with just about anybody.  12  Finchum  Haught  Some of his closest friends in the Senate were very partisan Democrats,  like Hubert Humphrey for example. He and Hubert served on the  agriculture committee together. They made a trip to Russia together.  They headed up a delegation to Russia, and they had a great time.  Edmund Muskie, he, of course, ran for president on the democratic  ticket, or ran as a candidate, was the chairman of the budget committee.  He and Muskie got along famously. Fritz Hollings of South Carolina,  who succeeded Muskie, he and Bellmon were good friends. But it was  just that the democratic senators felt like they had to support the man of  their party, although hardly any of them did it very openly, except for  Cannon. Bellmon retained his support and loyalty among the  Republicans. Howard Baker was one of his strongest supporters. It was  just a weight on his shoulders. I really think a good study could be made  of that time. I think it could make a pretty good book. But anyway, the  election was finally decided. Largely as a result of that, I think Bellmon  really kind of got burned out, really burned out. He had been kind of  burned out before. All the time he served in the Senate, of course, his  brother from Ponca City   oh, what was his brother   s name?  George?  George. Yes. George was running the farm, he was taking care of the  farm, but Bellmon   s thoughts were always at the farm. And, of course,  everybody knows Bellmon was an early riser on the farm. He would rise  early and he would spend a lot of time on the phone in those hours  before anybody came to the office. One of the first things he did was to  find out how things were on the farm, weather, crop conditions, and all  those things. So he remained very in touch with the farm all the time he  was away and he felt like he needed to get back and try to do something  about that.  He was not a wealthy man. He didn   t accumulate a lot of money. He  didn   t go out and make speeches and get big fees like Mac Mathias did,  Senator Mathias   he made no bones about it. I mean, he would go and,  everything within the law, you know. They   ve kind of cracked down on  that, I think, since that time, but Mathias would. He was a good speaker,  and he had a good speech writer, a woman named Peggy. He would  make a considerable amount of money making speeches. But Bellmon  didn   t. He didn   t have any other income. He probably had some  investments, but not much. So all those things together, and he talks  about this in the book The Life and Times of Henry Bellmon. He just  decided that he could not stay in the Senate. So he made the decision not  to run, and he was back in Oklahoma when he announced it. Actually,  he called us, I guess, right before he made the public announcement. Got  people on the speaker phones and all that, let the staff know. It really  caught us by surprise, because we kind of thought he might give it  13  Finchum  Haught  another term. A lot of us were kind of planning our futures that way, so  we had to make some adjustments. But we didn   t hold it against him.  And then, of course, he went back  to Oklahoma  and later ran for  Governor again, and I think he enjoyed that term, that four years. Not  taking anything away from anything that happened after he quit the  Senate and went back, from my own personal viewpoint, I feel like I had  the best years with Bellmon. I was with him when he was a freshman in  public office, with the four-year term as Governor. I wasn   t, of course,  in the governor   s office but for two and a half years, but I was there, and  then for twelve years with him in the Senate. I think those were his most  productive years, and the years that he probably will be remembered for.  There will be people that worked for him in the second term as Governor  and say,    Oh no, that   s not right. He   ll be remembered for his education  programs.    I think he   ll be remembered for a lot of things.  Well, name a few more.  Well, I   ve already touched on his contributions to agricultural  legislation, because he knew the business. I can   t think of anything  specific, except energy. And it   s really interesting that right now, at this  time, we   re talking about,    We need an energy policy. This country   s  got to have a better energy policy.    They were talking about the same  thing back in the seventies, and really working to try to find some  answer to the problem, to get people away from depending on fossil  fuels. But as long as people drive automobiles and use electricity and all  those things, it   s not an easy solution. And so, he did a lot. I just think he  will be remembered, as I said before, as a man of the soil. That   s kind of  a corny term, but he was well grounded. Here we   re using a lot of  metaphors, and not intentionally. He had his feet on the ground, and he  was very loyal to Oklahoma.  One thing that he, I think, will and should be remembered for was what  he did for Oklahoma to promote the state. This was in an area of deep  personal interest with Bellmon. He loved Oklahoma, and he wanted  everybody else to think it   s as good a state as he did. One of the things  that he was faced with when he became Governor was the New York  World   s Fair, which was to take place in 1964-   65. It was a two-year  World   s Fair. He asked his staff, and a number of other people, to do  some brainstorming,    Let   s try to figure out what we can do.    A lot of  the other states had been planning and developing their ideas for their  exhibits at the fair for a long time and we had a very short time to do it.  So with the creative genius of Doc Jordan, whose name is Warren K.  Jordan, but he was nicknamed    Doc    because his father was a  pharmacist, who had an advertising agency and he had been the  advertising agency during the governor   s campaign as well as the Senate  14  Finchum  Haught  campaign later, but this was still when he was Governor.  Doc Jordan and Bob Kumler, who was his partner, came up with the  idea, instead of building a big building, which would cost an awful lot of  money, that we would have an open air exhibit. It was going to be an  excavation in the shape of the state of Oklahoma, and it was kind of like  a sunken map of the state. It had different things in it. It was like one of  these animated maps that you see. It would be in a park-like setting,  there would be trees, there would be park benches, there would be a very  small booth for information, and we would staff it with    Sooner guides.     These are young men and women, I   m pretty sure there were some  women, mostly men I think because they had to live up there and all.  Lee Paden was one of those, I mentioned him earlier. These were  carefully selected. They were people who would greet you with a smile  and they would give a good appearance. We got some blazers for them  to wear, and they would project Oklahoma hospitality. Well, it was one  of the best exhibits at the fair. We got so many compliments on it. And I  say we, I mean talking about the governor   s office. My involvement in it  was not so much from the contributing of ideas, although I guess I threw  some out, but to make sure the story got out, and so that was that.  Later on in his term, one day he was sitting at his desk, and I guess there  were a couple staff people around. We saw he was really deep in thought  or something, and he said,    We need to have a Miss America from  Oklahoma.    There hadn   t been one in a long time, and I don   t know  what he did. We were talking about Clyde Wheeler, who lived in  Lavern, Oklahoma, and I think maybe he might   ve talked to Clyde. This  is just pure speculation, but anyway, Jane Jayroe lived in Laverne. And  Jane Jayroe ended up being Miss America during Bellmon   s term, and  again, I say I don   t know what all took place, but all I know is that he set  his sights on Oklahoma having a Miss America, and it happened. But he  would just promote Oklahoma any chance he got.  I think Shirley did, too.  Oh, Shirley did. Oh, yes, definitely. Shirley Bellmon was the best asset  that a politician or a public official could have. Shirley was just plain  Shirley. I mean, she never put on airs about anything, she was herself, a  country farm wife, but she had so many great ideas. Well, I mean the  Bellmon Belles in his campaign for governor. Shirley designed the red,  white, and blue dresses they wore, and they continued that into the  senate campaign, too. And in fact, Henry and Shirley and the three  daughters traveled over the state together in the campaign. Then after he  was elected, and this was one thing that I did, and how I really got to  where I felt like I had a close relationship with him, was that I traveled  with them, you know, getting the news out.  15  Bellmon had already gotten pretty well acquainted with most of the  editors in the state, because he made an effort to do that. He went to the  press association meetings, and any time he was in a town as a candidate  and was campaigning, he would go by the newspaper office and talk to  them. That   s how he won a lot of the support from hard line democrats  over the state, was through the newspaper editor. There were some  pretty strong republican editors, too, that helped him a lot. After he was  elected it was kind of a thank-you tour, I guess, but he didn   t call it that.  The other thing they did that is kind of funny, since we   re talking about  the meetings they   re having, is that Henry Bellmon had meetings, two  party  meetings . Talking about the Tea Party movement, today? Well,  Henry Bellmon also had tea parties, but these were two party tea parties,  and they usually didn   t serve tea, they served coffee. The idea was that  you would get together in the home of somebody. You   d find somebody  in the town that would host one of these things. In many cases it was a  democrat, and they were usually the women, because they were usually  afternoon events. They called them two-party tea parties, and they would  have this group of people come in and Bellmon would come and answer  questions with them. And that   s how he really got to become known all  over the state to a lot of people.  He, to use the term    used women,    now, I don   t mean in the way that  you usually hear it. He accepted the people who volunteered their  services and time, and a lot of women wanted to help him win, and so he  accepted that. They organized these tea parties and other things, and  created the Bellmon Belles. The Bellmon Belles were his campaign  supporters. Not too long after he was elected, he was invited to come to  Washington and speak. I think it was to the Republican National  Committee Meeting and we worked together and prepared a paper. It  was called,    How Women Won for Me.    It told the story of how women  helped him get elected.  But Shirley Bellmon, well, she was a wonderful cook. She was a  wonderful wife and mother, and so talented. She got into all kinds of art,  stained glass, and she could do anything she set her mind to. She  contributed an awful lot to his career and to the health and happiness of  him and his staff. And it   s not saying anything against the woman he  married later. She   s a wonderful woman. She was the wife of one of his  biggest supporters, Irvin Bollenbach. Her name is Eloise, but they never,  of course, had the same relationship. They were both up in years, and  actually she lived on her farm and he lived on his farm. They   d live  together some of the time, travel together and all that. He   s a great  family man.  16  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  They used the term in the Senate that,    we   ve got show horses and work  horses,    and a lot of the senators will get up and posture that way.  Bellmon will have to be characterized as a work horse. He didn   t get up  and make these high-blown speeches and everything. He would make a  speech. He would get up and do a floor statement, but it was pretty  straight down the line and pretty serious. He was not a show off. He  applied himself to the job, even though there were some times he didn   t  really enjoy doing it very much. And he was, as I say, well liked and  respected. Even people who disagreed with him, they did respect him.  Were you surprised when he chose not to run for re-election for  Governor the second time he could have?  I really was not very close to that. In fact, I wasn   t close to it at all in  terms of the campaign or anything. If I had any feeling at all, I guess  maybe it was that I was not surprised. I think he always had a feeling he  wasn   t really meeting his responsibilities as head of the family and the  farm and all that, because he was off doing this stuff in politics. Now,  that   s an exaggeration. I think, probably, that if I had any reaction at all  to that, it was that I was not surprised, that he probably thought he had  done as much public service as he either wanted to do or felt that he  could do. As far as his physical condition, he really remained, for a man  of his age, in fairly good physical condition, right until the end. He did  have Parkinson   s, but that didn   t slow him down. It   s well known that  just the week before he died, he held a meeting on education and was  very alert and in command and coming forth with ideas and all that. His  mind was alert until the day he died.  Did you make very many trips to the farm with him?  When the need arose. It was a good place to have private meetings. You  could be away from people and the phone and all, and it was a relaxed  setting. He was always more relaxed there. The farm is a beautiful place  and, of course, he and Shirley designed the house and did a lot of work  on it. He had that pond there which was nice to fish in. I never did fish in  it, but some of the staff did. I was there enough to know and be quite  familiar with it. I   m not sure I would recognize it now. They   re  operating it as kind of a B B or something, I think.  Well, his daughters would have grown up here?  They did grow up here. Pat Bellmon went to work for the old  Washington Star, and was there for quite some time. Gail, I think, went  back to Oklahoma and she got married fairly soon, but Ann was here.  Let   s see now. Would they have finished school here? I can   t recall if  they finished school here or not. Some of them might   ve been in college,  17  Finchum  Haught  but Pat stayed here because she found work here. I don   t want to get off  on too much personal stuff, because in the first place I don   t know much  about it, and the second place, I just don   t do that. Pat married an  Oklahoma guy and that didn   t last. Then she married a guy that worked  for the newspaper up here and they were together for quite a long while.  I think he died. Then she married another time. The Bellmon girls were  not much in evidence in his Senate life. They were off doing their thing.  When he went back to Oklahoma, you chose not to?  Yes. For one thing, I had remarried. I had a first wife and three sons who  were in Oklahoma. One of the sons has subsequently moved to  Pennsylvania, but the other two are still back there. And in 1978, I  married Mary, and she was working for Sun Oil Company and had her  roots here. In fact, when Bellmon went back to Oklahoma and I had to  go out, fifty years old, looking for a job. (Laughs) I mean, I did work for  Mathias that period of time, but then after that I decided that I   d rather  just work out of my house and be on my own. Fortunately, I could do  that because Mary had a good job, quite frankly. And we had made a lot  of friends here and all that.  The other thing was I didn   t have any  compelling reason  to go back to  Oklahoma. I probably could   ve gotten a job back there, but even if he  were going back with the intention of running for governor again, he  couldn   t have done it right away, and I would   ve had to find something  to do in that time. I was pretty well burned out on public service. I was  particularly burned out on the Senate life, because it can get to you. I  would have stayed with Bellmon if he had run for a third term because  of our association and because I liked working for him, but I wasn   t at  all looking for a third term with another senator.  Basically, I went into the Mathias office as an administrative assistant,  the top guy, but it was mainly to keep the staff together. Mathias, his  administrative assistant was a guy named Joseph Digenova, Joe  Digenova, and Joe was a very able person. That was when the  republicans became the majority, and so Mathias got a committee  chairmanship, not a ranking minority member, but an actual committee  chairmanship, as Bellmon would have. He would have become chairman  of the budget committee if he had stayed in the Senate. It   s a foregone  conclusion. He was the ranking minority member. So Joe went over to  head up the Senate Rules Committee staff, and that left an opening for  administrative assistant on the senator   s personal staff. And he said,     Your job is to make the trains run on time.    That was his term, keep the  staff together, make sure everything   s done that needs to be done, and all  that. It didn   t challenge me, necessarily. I mean, it challenged me from  the standpoint of here I was having to deal with a staff totally different  18  Finchum  Haught  from the one I   d been used to, all with totally different kinds of  backgrounds. A lot of them were from Maryland, most of them, I guess.  Maryland is not Oklahoma.  And also, not being close to the senator and all of his staff knew that, so  there were some of them that challenged me. His secretary for one thing.  She was the doorkeeper, and that   s not uncommon. So I really had to  sort of feel my way in and do what I could do and realize that what I  couldn   t do, not to do. He was not really calling on me to exert a lot of  originality about anything. And I   m a creative kind of person. So I was  not seeking to serve another six years for another senator. I was quite  happy to really return to a private life, even though it meant working  hard to build up. At the time I was offered this job as editorial writer for  The Oklahoman, I was kind of hitting my stride at writing reports and  doing other kinds of work like that.  Do you have a couple of favorite Bellmon stories? Or Shirley, or  campaign stories?  There   s one that goes way, way back, and it   s just kind of a funny story.  I mentioned traveling with him in that time after he was elected. He was,  of course, called on to make a lot of speeches around the state, being the  new governor and all. Well, to back up a little bit, when Bellmon first  went into office, he said he was going to drive his own car. He did not  want a driver. The highway patrol always assigned a limousine and a  driver and he didn   t want any of that. Well, that didn   t last very long, but  then he said he didn   t want a full time one. Before that, the governor was  assigned a driver and when he wasn   t driving him somewhere, he didn   t  have anything to do. He didn   t have any other assignment and he would  sit in the lobby of the governor   s office and read newspapers, whatever  else. Well, Bellmon wasn   t going to do anything like that. So what they  did was they would assign    on call.    If he needed to be driven  somewhere, they would just assign a trooper. Later on, they did assign  the same person to do that. They must   ve thought up enough duties for  him that it was alright.  There   s a time when Bellmon and I and the driver had been traveling  and we stopped to spend the night at Durant, down in South Central  Oklahoma. I don   t even remember the name of the motel. It probably  had the family name that ran it. It was kind of late, probably eight thirty,  nine o   clock or something like that. We went in and the owner, I guess,  was on the desk, and he said,    Oh, I   m sorry, I only have one room,    I  think is what he said. And so I said,    You mean you can   t find a room  for the governor of Oklahoma?    He says,    Are you the governor? Well,  sure. I   ll give you the bridal suite.    So Henry Bellmon and I spent the  night in the bridal suite, and the trooper got the other room. I always  19  Finchum  Haught  thought that was one of the funny stories.  Let me think now, about maybe a Senate story. Well, I remember the  security, and this isn   t just Bellmon, but I should be focusing on  Bellmon. I remember the security being so much looser than it became.  Of course, it became that fairly soon after the bomb in the Capitol there.  I recall vividly people like  Senator  Ted Kennedy walking across the  street in the open from the office building to the Capitol, an easy target  for anybody that wanted to assassinate, as well as other well-known  senators.  I have one little personal recollection about the days when I was the  State Economic Opportunity Coordinator. That was the time that Sargent  Shriver, who was the national director of the Office of Economic  Opportunity, came for a visit and LaDonna Harris, who was Fred  Harris   s wife at the time, I think, I   m not sure when they got divorced.  But anyway, LaDonna was with him. She was doing a lot for American  Indians, and carried that on throughout later years. And they, apparently,  flew down together and they had a car. It wasn   t a limousine, but it was  a big car, rented for the occasion. I was in the car with the two of them  while they were driving around Oklahoma City, looking at the priority  projects, and they had some very interesting conversations. I can   t recall  anything they talked about, but all I can say is that I was privileged to be  there, to just see the back and forth exchange of them.  I   m trying to think of a real vivid Bellmon story. I know one of the  evenings at the home, he dreamed up this idea. Bellmon came up with  some really clever ideas. I mentioned his serious statements on the floor,  but he had a great sense of humor, and he could tell stories that would  make people laugh. Not jokes, per se, but just good stories. And he  always had a wonderful sense of humor. But he decided to have a  Chinese dinner, and he wanted his daughter Pat and me to, each of us, do  a Chinese dish. I   d kind of gotten into Chinese cooking. And so we did,  and we came up with some names. Pat was doing something that  involved boiling water. I don   t know whether she was doing noodles or  what, I can   t remember now, but we called her    Won-Pot Pat.    W-O-N  P-O-T Pat, and I was, let   s see, my nickname used the term    Wok,    but  can I remember what it was?    Hot Wok Haught.    Yeah, that was my  nickname. So that was a kind of a gag thing. Oh, we had a lot of fun  with other senators with challenges of different kinds, like football  games, and things. They still do that, I guess. It   s just kind of a tradition.  Did you attend any OU/OSU games with him?  No, that   s one thing I never did.  20  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  Did he attend any?  Bellmon was not a big sports fan, but I   m sure he enjoyed it, and I   m  sure he must have. When he was in Washington, he   d go back to  Oklahoma as often as he could. There were many, many weekends that  he would go back, he and Shirley. So no, I didn   t do that. And we didn   t  have a whole lot of kidding about schools, or anything. It was just there.  I may think of something later, but right now I don   t recall any particular  good anecdote about the Senate years.  Have any common phrases or a favorite quote or something?  We had one for him in the governor   s office. We would get together as a  staff, not the entire staff, but his secretary and maybe the AA   Administrative Assistant  and maybe one other person, and go over his  speaking requests. He would get invitations to do a lot of things. He  would talk about these and,    Well, this is so-and-so invited me, and she  did a lot for me in the campaign,    and then,    This is someone really  interested. I   d like to do it.    We just said,    But you can   t do everything.  You can   t be everywhere you want to be.    After so much of that, one  day he called one of these meetings and he said,    All right. It   s time we  get hard-nosed about this. We   ve got to get hard-nosed about these  invitations.    Well, at that meeting and all subsequent meetings, he went  through the same thing. He would go through and we   d say,    You can   t  do it. You can   t do it. You can   t do it.       Oh yeah, but I   ve got to do it.     So we started calling him    Old Steel Nose    (being hard-nosed about it).  He said,    Well, Old Steel Nose is going to have his way.    Somehow he  managed to make enough appearances to suit him and of course, it was  wearing on him. That   s the kind of thing anybody has to do.  There was one campaign incident (in the senate campaign) that I   d kind  of like to talk about. When we were getting ready to really launch the  campaign, I said,    We need to have a photograph that will capture the  attention of the Oklahomans and the public. Some people may not know  that much about Bellmon.    And so I came up with the idea to have the  Bellmon family, Henry and Shirley and the three girls, nicely dressed,  like they were posing for a photograph somewhere, standing out in a  wheat field. Well, that was a little hard to sell.    What do you mean, go  out and stand in a wheat field? I mean, that   s ridiculous.    But they did it.  It was a campaign poster. We put it in our campaign newspaper and we  probably circulated it to newspapers over the state. They, of course,  were waving, and we did it in color. It was a nice colorful picture, and I  took some satisfaction when the Bellmon book came out, The Life and  Times of Henry Bellmon, which his daughter, Pat, wrote with him. They  didn   t have the family picture, but they had him standing out in the  wheat field on the cover, and on the inside of the book. So that wasn   t  21  Finchum  Haught  such a bad idea after all, I guess.  I had a note to ask about the Oklahoma Historical Preservation Center?  Okay, good. Yeah. I   d like to talk about that, to a degree. Bellmon was  always wanting to promote Oklahoma, and he came up with ideas and  everything. This one he happened to borrow from the state of Florida,  and I can   t remember who the senator was at that time. One of the  senators from Florida let him know about what they called    The Florida  House.    This was a rather large house, I think it might have been three  stories, at least two stories, that was right across C-street, I think. It was  very, very near the Capitol. And, I think it was pink, but anyway, it was  a nice looking house on a corner. The state of Florida had bought this  house, this property, and used it as a hospitality center for people from  Florida visiting Washington. They could go there and, of course, get  some orange juice, and sit, rest, get information. It was not a home away  from home, necessarily, but it was a place they could go. It didn   t have  sleeping accommodations, at least, I don   t think it did, but it was just a  place that they could go while they were in town.  Well, Henry Bellmon thought it would be a good idea if Oklahoma did  that, too. And so he asked me to see what could be done about it. Well,  we decided to talk to some of the people that could maybe put up some  money to acquire a place. Found a house that was pretty close to the  Senate office building side of the Capitol, not too far from the Supreme  Court. This was a Victorian house, it was red brick, and it had these  turrets, and it was a very impressive-looking house. Actually, that wasn   t  the first one. I   m sorry. I   m getting ahead of myself. We found another  place that was not that impressive, but there was a place, and this  happened. This idea started developing after Dewey Bartlett learned that  he had cancer, and it wasn   t late in Bellmon   s term, but there wasn   t a  whole lot of time, because we didn   t know how long Bartlett was going  to live. He was terminal. So we found this place, and there was an  attorney named Peyton George that helped on it.  We had a dedication of this house, and we called it    The Okie House.    I  developed this whole day   s program with a lot of help. We had a group  from Oklahoma City University come to Washington, and we had this  celebration at Ford   s Theater. It was an invited group and they  performed songs from Oklahoma. We had some speeches and all that,  and that was the end of Okie Day. Okie Day was the name. We had a  dedication of The Okie House, and then people scattered around. There  were a lot of people up here from Oklahoma for it. They closed the  evening then, it was Okie Night at Ford   s Theater.  Then, later we did acquire this red brick Victorian house, but we never  22  could get the project developed to the extent that we could afford to have  somebody there all the time. We did get some furniture contributed. I  think there might have been some furniture in it. It had magnificent  fireplaces, and nice walls and everything. It was in good condition, for  the most part. There was an actual board formed, and Tony Calvert (who  is Horace Kelogg    Tony    Calvert) was one of the people that was very  active in it, and Ann Bartlett served on the board. There just never was  that much interest generated in it to really carry it to its full potential. So  eventually we just had to shut it down, and it went back to private hands.  One of the nicest things we did there was an art exhibit. We had a  woman from Tulsa who had an art studio there. She brought a bunch of  paintings up and we hung them on the walls and we had an art exhibit.  We opened the house for various occasions, for the Oklahoma State  Society. Every state, of course, has a State Society in Washington, and  we used it for some of those meetings. It never did reach the point of  being like the Florida house in that there was somebody there all the  time and could serve as a hospitality center. So it was a highlight, but  also sad to see that it didn   t develop.  As far as the Okie program, Bellmon, as I said, always wanted to  promote the state. He wanted to do something different from other  governors, and not just have honorary Colonels and things like that. He  kept talking about John Steinbeck, and    He   s really done a bad thing for  Oklahoma.    One of his sayings, one of his philosophies, and it wasn   t  original with Bellmon, but it   s the one that a lot of people associate, was,     If somebody hands you a lemon, make lemonade.    And so with that  thought in mind, I came up with the idea of taking the word    Okie,    as  John Steinbeck laid on Oklahoma, take the word    Okie    and make it a  term to be proud of, and say,    I   m proud to be an Okie.    And so I  drafted, laid out a program, a proposal, and a lot of things that could be  done with it. We could have essay contests. We could have this, that,  and the other, but it was at a time in Bellmon   s term that he really  couldn   t focus on it. Then he appointed me to take over the Economic  Opportunity Program, and so that idea was just left with nothing done  about it.  It was still there when Dewey Bartlett came into office, and Mike  McCarville, his press secretary, took it and sold it to Bartlett, and they  ran with it. They made the Okie Program one of the most popular things  that ever happened in a governor   s office in Oklahoma, and Mike gives  me credit. He wrote a book called Okie and he gives me credit for it, but  again, it was something I conceived, but I never saw through fruition for  Bellmon. Instead, Bellmon was talked into creating the Oklahoma  Ambassadors Corps by Ben West, who was head of one of the television  stations there at that time. He came up with that idea, and it was a good  23  Finchum  Haught  program. It was alright. It had a nice certificate and I remember a  number of people that we made ambassadors. One of them was Roger  Miller, back before he became as famous as he became. We had the  ceremony in the morning, and it was quite obvious that Roger was not  an early morning person. I   m not talking about early morning, but I  doubt Roger got up before noon. He was a nice guy. He was very, very  quiet. Another little ironic thing was we gave him this great honor,  Oklahoma Ambassador, and then when we had the senate campaign, he  came to Oklahoma to campaign for Mike Monroney. I   m sure they  asked him to do it and he probably forgot about being an Oklahoma  Ambassador. He didn   t give him a lot of help. But yeah, some great fun  times, and as I say, it   s some very, very fond memories of those days.  And your creativity had to go first and center a lot of times, to come up  with speeches and slogans and such.  Well, Bellmon did not speak from text very often. And if he did, he   d  read it, but he always appreciated material. He was a good collector of  material himself. By that I mean not just jokes but facts and figures and  things like that. And we   d usually just use index cards. This was back  when I was the governor   s press secretary. Quite often we would figure  out something to make news, and it would be something he could  announce, something he was working on, to be able to make news. I  would do a news release, a press release, and then I would take what was  the news out of it and put it on a card for him to say so that we could  issue the news release. He was such a candid guy that more than one  time, and I   d be with him out in the crowd, he would get up and he  would just make some ad-lib remarks, as usual, things like that. Then he  would stop and look down and say,    Now, let me see. Bob Haught says  I   ve got to read this because we   re going to do a news release.    (Laughs)  And of course, I was turning red and all that, but the people loved it.  That also reminds me of another little anecdote about traveling with him,  and being out in the crowd. One of those occasions, and of course,  people are people, and a celebrity is a celebrity. Some people just love to  see celebrities. I remember this one woman, she comes up to me and she  says,    You work for the governor?       Yes, I do,    I said. She said,    Well,  are you his bodyguard?    (Laughs)    No, lady, I   m not his bodyguard. I   m  just his press secretary.    I couldn   t imagine anybody thinking I   d be  anybody   s bodyguard.  Oh I, you know, I   d give him some jokes. I remember one time he was  introducing Ronald Reagan at some place, and he was not a big fan of  Ronald Reagan. His guy, at that time, was John Connally, whatever year  it was that they were running for president. He was a democrat, but then  turned republican. We did this introduction, and I can   t remember  24  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  exactly how it went, but it was,    I   m proud to introduce to you the  governor of one of our largest states,    on and on and on and on and on,  and like it was describing Reagan. Then at the end of it he said,    But  since John Connally isn   t here, I   m going to present to you Ronald  Reagan.    He and Reagan got along alright, but they were not close. It  was usually just quips and things like that.  And we just lost Hannah Atkins     Well, since she was in his administration in the second term, I didn   t  have that kind of relationship. I certainly was quite aware of all of what  she did in Oklahoma in her career. We didn   t have a personal  relationship.  Her being democrat and him republican     Well, that was good. That was the kind of guy that Bellmon was. He had  a lot of democrats. In fact, he was the first governor to have a black staff  person, a woman named Beulah Ponder, who was a democrat. Then he  made several appointments with minorities later on. On the senate staff,  we had a black staff person named Joe Kinney. There was an Indian  staff person. He was on a committee, not our personal staff. As far as  minorities were concerned, one of the best stories of the first campaign  for Governor, and this was before I became associated with him, the  Bellmons had made a trip to Hawaii. I   m not sure what year it was. Of  course, he was in the Pacific in WWII, and then the Bellmons went over  there on vacation. I think they either stayed with this family or they got  acquainted with them, and a daughter from this family then visited the  Bellmons, and it was at the time of the campaign. I can   t remember her  name, it was a Hawaiian name. Anyway, she traveled around all over the  state with us, with the daughters. People were interested in that sort of  thing.  Bellmon liked to eat. He enjoyed just about any kind of food. As I said,  he and Shirley did not imbibe in alcohol, but he tolerated it. He certainly  wouldn   t tolerate drunkenness. You couldn   t expect him to. Any good  boss wouldn   t tolerate that. Lee Paden, and he can tell you this story  better than I can, but there was some occasion when Shirley was going  to do Baked Alaska, for some occasion. She sent Henry out to get some  rum to flame it with, and they would do that. You can imagine him  going to get liquor in the first place, but he went to the liquor store. He  told them he needed some rum, and he didn   t think anything about it  being any special kind and so he brought it back. They poured the rum  on and it wouldn   t light, and naturally what they did was they kept  pouring rum on it until it become rum-soaked. I guess the end of that  story is everybody liked it.  25  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  This is not my story, but it   s a good story, and it   s in his book. He got  the name of    Buttermilk Bellmon,    because he didn   t drink alcohol.  What he did was he told the Capitol press staff corps that they were  welcome to come to the mansion, but they were not going to be serving  alcohol in the mansion. Well, this is right after the J. Howard  Edmondson administration, and that administration was wild and crazy.  They were the frat boys, and they liked to drink and party and all that.  But he said,    No alcohol served, but you can always get a cold glass of  milk.    Not buttermilk. Milk. That was his phrase. But somebody in the  group wrote the story and changed it to buttermilk. After that any time  he would go just about anywhere, the waiter would always come and  serve him a glass of buttermilk privately, and he said,    I despise the  stuff.    He didn   t like buttermilk.  He would eat lots of different kinds of things, he enjoyed that. Kathy   Christie  was talking about his power naps. He did tend to nod off at  times. They didn   t go the theater very much, but one time after they  came to Washington a lot of the staff went to the theater. Can   t  remember what the name of play was now. And sure enough, Bellmon  slept through the whole thing. I mean, it just didn   t grab his interest, and  so I   m sure it was probably reported.  Well if he got up so early, how late would he stay up?  Well, that   s true, yeah. That   s another thing about him. Getting up early,  I didn   t have any problem with that because one of my shifts at UPI  started at five a.m. I   d done the five a.m., then I worked the night shift,  then I went into the middle, so that wasn   t a whole lot of trouble for me.  And I continued that into the Senate, and it was particularly helpful in  the Senate because you could get around and drive into work early  enough to beat most of the traffic. You could get quite a bit done before  the main business and things started.  In closing, if you can only say a couple of words about him, what would  you say?  Well, I guess I   ve overused these, but honest, hard-working, straight-talking,  faithful to his principles and ideals, hard-nosed, and I would say  that as a compliment. He was not dictatorial at all. He would allow his  staff to say what they wanted to say about anything, but once he made  up his mind about something, he was very stubborn. And some people  call him    The Stubborn Dutchman.    But you have to admire somebody  for not caving in to something that might be more politically desirable.  He did stick to his guns on things, and I   m proud to have had that  association. I   m proud to have worked for him. I really am.  26  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Haught  Finchum  Sixteen good years?  I guess it was sixteen in all, yeah. Yeah, when you add them up with the  four years as Governor and the campaign, and then the twelve years     It may be more than sixteen.  A little more. They were good years.  I thank you for spending this afternoon with me.  Oh I   m happy to do it. And I wish you success on this project, and I   ll  look forward to following the progress.  Okay. Thank you.  -------  -------
