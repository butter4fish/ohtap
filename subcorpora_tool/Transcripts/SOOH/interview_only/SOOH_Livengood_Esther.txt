 Wilson  Livengood  Today is June 22, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Oklahoma State  University Library. I am in Shattuck, Oklahoma today talking with  Esther Livengood about her memories of the 1930s, the Dust Bowl  around here, and also her origins as a German from Russia. Thank you  for talking with me today. Will you tell me when and where you were  born?  I was born in June 19, 1918, on a farm southwest of Shattuck called the  Puckett Place. Other than being born out there, that   s all I can tell you.  How long did your family live out there?  I think we lived out there until Daddy   we moved to town and lived in  this northeast part of Shattuck until we purchased our family home,  which is just a block down from where Shattuck Hospital is built now.  Do you know how old you were when you moved there?  I was probably three or four years old because I know I started to school  and we had to walk from where the hospital is now, clear over   it was a  hilltop, over here, in this part of town. We walked in the wintertime.  How old were you when you started to school?  Well, I must   ve been in the primary because they started us in the  basement of the old schoolhouse, and they had to vacate the basement  because it was being infested with snakes. They finished the new part of  the school, the south wing of the school, to get us ready for one through  four grades. I think it was four grades. They moved us out of the  basement of the old school to the new school.  5  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Did you ever see any snakes in the basement?  No, no.  You just heard about them?  I just heard about them. I know the janitor, he   d sit there and feed the     in the wintertime, I can still see him shoveling that coal into the furnace  to heat the building.  How big was the building?  Well, I think it was the basement and one, two, three stories, I think,  because we went down into the basement. We didn   t ever have any  access to the other part of the building, other than in and out. So, I know  the original picture, I think, was three stories of the building.  What do you remember about the school day? What was school like?  Well, I remember that we always sat at little tables and in a way, it was  very nice. I can remember my teacher   s name being Miss Gist. G-I-S-T,  I think it is. I have her picture. She was a very pretty lady. Then they  moved us to the new school, and that   s where I graduated in 1938, from  high school.  Well, how did your parents come to this area?  Mother   s family came, and they came in, I believe, down on the Gulf  Coast at some port.  In Galveston?  It must   ve been. I never have studied too much about their arrival.  Anyway, I know Mother was sixteen years old when she came over and  there were other members of the family.  Including her parents?  Yes.  And they were coming from Russia?  Yes.  But they were Germans.  6  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Yes, they were German people. Catherine the Great wanted the German  people to come to Russia to settle to try to teach the Russian people how  to grow better crops and just be better farmers. It was difficult, because I  know Grandpa had to go across the river and in the wintertime it was  frozen.  Do you know what river that was?  No. Well, I know they lived close to the Black Sea, which is on the map  in Russia. It   s in the southern part of Russia.  So, I wonder if it was the Volga River?  Yes, I think it was the Volga River.  Did they speak German to each other?  Oh, yes, yes. Oh, yes. We talked German until we started to school. Of  course, we had to learn English.  Was your father   s family also German?  Both of them. Yes, they were full-blooded German people.  Had your father   s family come from Russia, as well?  Yes, Dad   s family came from   it was further north where they lived,  further north in Russia. Grandpa, the Treiber   s, Mother   s family, lived  more in the southern area, along the Volga River, along in there where a  lot of the German people had resettled.  How did they all get to the Shattuck area?  Well, all I can remember is that Grandpa had to sew his money in his  pants belt to hide it from the Russians. They went, I suppose, by train or  wagon, I don   t know, to a harbor in northern Germany where they set  sail and came to America.  Do you know how long they were sailing?  Oh, I don   t have any idea, but it was quite lengthy, I   m sure.  When they got to the port on the Gulf Coast, how did they know they  wanted to come up here?  Well, apparently there was some indication that they had relatives in this  7  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  area and they came to this area. Dad first came to Kansas, and then they  came down here. But Mother   s family came directly here, to Oklahoma.  Do you know how your parents met?  No, I can   t tell you that either. Anyway, they were all a nice looking  family. I think I   ve got a picture of my   do you mind me getting it?  No, not at all.  It   s just a paper picture.  Livengood shows photos  This is my Dad   s  family, but they   re not all on here. There   s a sister and a brother that are  still lacking, but anyway, that   s the family. This is our family picture,  my mom and dad, my sister and brother, and then the rest of us kids.  What were your parents    names?  Deal, D-E-A-L. I think they changed the spelling to the English spelling.  The spelling that they used in Germany was D-I-E-H-L. It had German  spelling.  What church did they go to?  Well, we were Lutheran people. Lutheran church, German people.  Were your grandparents living around here when you were young?  Grandpa, yes.  What did they do for a living?  Farm.  What did they farm?  Well, Grandpa Treiber, they lived, originally, out southwest and they  moved way down south, close to Canadian River. It was south of  Podunk. My dad   s folks just lived right   you go south and west and  across the railroad tracks, and there was their farm.  What were their main crops?  I suppose wheat, I don   t know.  And they always spoke German?  8  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Yes. Later in life, my aunt, she never did get married, and she picked up  English. I don   t think her father learned English, but anyway. Here   s my  mother and her sister and brother  gesturing to photo . Mother was older.  I don   t know just how old.  Is that after they came here?  Yes.  Do you remember some food that they would prepare? Did they prepare  German dishes?  Oh, yes  We went to church every Sunday, and I think we had noodle  soup, chicken and noodle soup, every Sunday. I think that was our main  dish.  Did you raise the chickens?  Oh, yes. Momma had chickens. In later life, she even raised them under  the brooder.  The incubator?  Yes, the incubator. (Laughter) This is my oldest brother, and he was so  good looking   Yes, he was  (Laughter)  I was proud of my family. This is my aunt, too. She was kind of old  fashioned, but she was a dresser  (Laughter)  I can tell  Wow  Well, you got their good looks. What were some of your  chores growing up?  Well, I think raising chickens and cattle and     Would you have to help slaughter the chickens?  Where we lived, here in town, we   d walk across the pasture to the road  and then to the road that led up to their farm. Anyway, we spent many an  afternoon with our grandparents.  Would they tell you about living in Russia?  Oh, I don   t think so. It was more American. They wanted to become  American people.  9  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Did they talk about if it was a struggle integrating into American  society?  No, I don   t think my folks ever complained too much about it. They  seemed to fit right in with ordinary people, because I know my mother  probably did laundry for Suzy   s grandparents and cleaning in their  homes, too.  Did your father farm?  Well, I think he tried to farm, but it didn   t pan out. I think he just worked  on the railroad. At the time, growing up, I remember being   worked at  different jobs. They were grown people coming over here.  Do you know anything about your parents    wedding?  No, I don   t think anything about their wedding.  Did you have a car when you were growing up?  No, we didn   t have a car. We did all the walking we had to do. We  walked.  When did you get your first job?  My first job was at eighth grade work after school.  Where was it?  That was my first job. I was always proud of it, to think that I could go  to work after school and earn some money.  Will you tell that story? We haven   t talked about it on tape yet, about  your teacher letting you out of school.  Oh, yes. That Mr. Seamus was very helpful with all the students that he  could help and especially he helped us, too.  How did he help?  Well, just like I could go work down there. In home ec, I learned to do  my own sewing. I made my own clothes.  And he let you out of school an hour early?  10  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Yes.  Where did you go to work?  It was called Williams    Variety Store.  Would they sell a little bit of everything?  It was just a regular variety store, yes, with a little bit of everything.  What was your job there?  Well, I waited on people and of course, cleaned. It had to be a clean  store. We cleaned the trays, the counters, and just did general work in a  store.  How long did you work there?  Well, I imagine I worked there three or four years, and then I could get  on at Skaggs. They were paying, I think, ten cents an hour more than  Mrs. Williams. She was very unhappy with me when I told her I was  going up there to work because it was really a smaller store and it wasn   t  as hard to work in as it was her store because her store was quite large.  Anyway, it was just competition.  Did you work at Skaggs quite a while?  Mr. Thomas, the chief operator, she called and she asked Mr. Thomas if  he knew of any young ladies that would be interested in working for the  telephone company. He suggested me so, at the time the opening was six  to eleven. So, I worked until six down at the variety store, then I went up  and worked at the telephone office until eleven at night, until the night  operator came on. Then I   d walk home.  How much did you get paid there?  Well, like I said, I trained in at ten cents an hour, and it probably went  oh, twelve, fifteen. Wages weren   t very much back then, but still every  bit we earned, we were tickled to earn it.  What would you do at the telephone operator   s?  Well, I always put my headset on and answered the switchboard because  there were always people. You   d say,    Number, please,    and connect  them to whatever number they wanted.  11  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Did you hear a lot of gossip working at the telephone?  Well, if I did, it   d go in one ear and out the other. (Laughter) We weren   t  to repeat, and I suppose that   s what I was taught to do and it could be  possible.  Well, let   s go back to the 1930s when the dust started rolling in.  Oh, yes, yes. It was very unpleasant, because I know Mother, when the  dirt was the worst, she   d wet cloths and hang them from the window.  Pretty soon, they were dirtier or something. We did have running water  and she wrenched them out, I guess. Anyway, it was bad in the dust  storms.  Do you remember Black Sunday?  Black Sunday? Yes, that Sunday that came in here, oh, my  It came in  out of the northwest. I   ll never forget it. I had some pictures     postcards   but I let my daughter-in-law  borrow them . She was making  a report on a book that she had read. It was one of the later books and so,  she wanted to use the pictures. I said,    Take care of them.    I said,     That   s all I   ve got.    So, she has them, but I haven   t gotten them back.  Where were you on that day?  I was at this doctor   s house, with my cousin. We always went over there.  They entertained a lot and they were eating. I suppose the doctors had to  go to the hospital, I don   t know. But anyway, they had two children, a  boy and a girl, and the lady put us all in the car and took us to the  hospital. We stayed in the basement there until we   I guess it was  towards evening. We told her we could just walk right down. But, oh,  when that dirt hit your legs, it really stung  It was blowing crazy and it  blew, blew, blew  There were so many days the wind blew terrible and  the dust was dirty. Oh, my  It was dirty, and it seemed like you never  could get rid of it. It was there all the time.  How would you keep it out of your eyes and your mouth?  I don   t know. I guess we just did. I know it was pretty miserable. It was  quite an ordeal.  What about the Depression? Did you feel the effects, or did things  change much?  Well, I was working. I had my own money, and I know I would buy  material there at the store. I could cut out a dress and I could sew it on  12  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  the sewing machine because I was taking home ec, and so I made a lot  of my own clothes like that.  What kind of sewing machine did you have?  Well, if I recall, it was called a New Home. We had that for years and  it   s still in existence. My grandson   s wife, they   re antique collectors and  so, they   re going up to Colorado so my grandson, I guess, picked it up  and he has it in his garage. They   re going to go out and get it because  she wants to keep it. It   s something from way back.  Were there home demonstration clubs?  Well, if there was, they were out in the country, more or less, or in town.  When did you start quilting?  Oh, my neighbor lady got me started. She wanted me to cut out squares  or triangles and she sewed them together for a quilt top. Then, she got  me started, and that   s when I started doing quilts.  How old were you?  Well, I was probably twelve, fifteen, along in there.  In the 1930s, did you know about the WPA  Works Progress  Administration  or the CCC  Civilian Conservation Corps ?  Well, I knew that Dad worked on the WPA, but other than that     Do you know what he worked on? What kinds of projects?  Well, there were different things in town, I think, that they worked at. I  know Daddy, more or less, his main job at the time was on the railroad.  He just did WPA work on the side?  Oh, I   m sure.  Do you know at all about how much he got paid through WPA?  No, I don   t remember.  What are some of your favorite meals that your mom would prepare?  Well, very, very limited. I know she did a lot of bread baking. She used  13  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  a lot of dough stuff. I can   t tell you just     Were there a lot of other people your age that spoke German?  Oh, yes, quite a few, because our church was in the country and we  drove to the country every Sunday for church.  Was the service in German?  Yes.  What was the church called?  I don   t remember exactly, but it was the Lutheran denomination.  Would they have gatherings at the church, besides     Oh, yes, big dinners. Yes, they did. It seemed like there was always food  for everybody. I don   t think we ever lacked for food. I don   t think we  ever went hungry. I guess that   s the way you might state it, that we  didn   t. We always had plenty. Back then, they just made everything, and  we managed to do with what was there.  Did you all raise a garden?  Well, we had a garden, but I don   t think Mother canned. What you  canned was mostly getting meat ready for wintertime and sauerkraut. I  know we made the big, ten gallons of sauerkraut and then Momma  canned a lot of it because we used a lot of kraut.  Do you still use her recipe to make sauerkraut?  Oh, yes. (Laughs) I remember Dad, they   d cut it. They had a regular  kraut cutter and they   d cut that kraut. You could buy it by the sacks full,  back then, and I know they   d cut it on this and then use salt and pound it  into the big, deep crock and let it ferment. When it was ready, Momma  canned it.  How long would it ferment? Do you remember?  I have no idea how long it took. It was always good.  I bet.  I love sauerkraut and wienies   14  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Do you still make that?  Oh, yes. Sauerkraut and wienies, that was always good.  Did your mother make her noodles?  Oh, yes, she made her own noodles. She cut them by hand. She   d roll  them out and then after it was so dry, she   d roll them up. She   d have that  knife and cut those noodles. Oh, my land  I always figured she was  going to cut her fingers off, but she never did  (Laughter)  Did she teach you how to make them?  No, I never attempted.  What about beer? Did your parents drink beer?  Well, they made beer. I guess Daddy drank it, I don   t know.  But they made their own?  Yes, they made their own. I don   t think you could afford to buy it. I  don   t know too much.  Did they play any musical instruments?  No, not my folks. We didn   t.  Did they like to go to dances?  Oh, yes. Daddy would take us on Saturday nights out to the country and  they had a square platform. The guys would play their fiddles and  guitars and us kids, we were all out playing, having fun, and the adults  were dancing away  (Laughter) That was our summer Saturday night  entertainment, was going to the dances. It was kind of fun to get together  with friends that we hadn   t seen for a week or two and got to know  them.  Was there an icehouse in Shattuck?  Icehouse? I think so, yes, because I can remember the man delivering  ice, and he   d chop it. We had an icebox and it fit in the icebox, whatever  size it was. Oh, boy  When he came he   d chop the ice and if there was  any that got chopped off, boy, we   d grab it because we were having a  treat  (Laughter) We washed it off and we had cold stuff.  15  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Would you ever make homemade ice cream?  Well, if we did, it was seldom. We didn   t make too much. But we did  have a cow. We had milk and cream.  So, when you lived in town, you had a cow on your property?  Well, we had a cow, but Daddy boarded it down on a farm just west of  town. He   d go down every morning and evening and milk the cow.  Did you have pigs or chickens or anything when you were in town?  Finally, they always had to clean and butcher the hog. Mother put the  meat down and then later in life, when she raised her chickens, I know  we took them someplace to be slaughtered. I don   t know. I can   t  remember whether Mother froze it or   don   t know. I just vaguely  remember about the chicken situation, back then.  What about for Christmas or Thanksgiving. Would you have a turkey, or  what would you have?  No, we usually ended up with a goose or a duck. Daddy didn   t like  turkey. He said it was too dry. So, we always had goose or duck.  Would you have a Christmas tree?  Yes. Sometimes we had a tree and sometimes we didn   t. I know we  decorated the room. We   d string it from corner to corner to the middle.  Mother let us trim the room so, we always had Christmas.  When you started to school, you said you spoke German at home. Before  that, was it hard to learn English?  Apparently, we must have learned English along as we were growing up,  there in town, because there were other kids in the neighborhood and  they weren   t all German. So, there was English and I think we probably  learned English along, and then in time, my folks became very fluent in  English. They could speak English very well.  What about your grandparents? Did they ever learn English?  Well, no, they were kind of stubborn about it. They weren   t going to  learn English. Anyway, Mom and Dad did. Dad, he went to school until  he was in the sixth grade. Mother, I don   t think, ever went to school after  she was over here. She went to work right away.  16  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Cleaning?  Yes, cleaning.  Did she work anywhere else?  Well, she worked in different homes in town, I know that.  In high school, you said you were in the band?  Yes.  Tell me about your experience with the competition.  Well, I bought my clarinet. I cleaned house for the band director. I think  it was twenty-eight dollars, the clarinet, and I learned to play a clarinet. I  cleaned house. I   d go after school, I   d go up to their house, I   d wash up  the dishes, make up the beds, and it was quite a   because they didn   t  have heat in the house all the time, in wintertime especially. I would  wash up the dishes and clean up the kitchen and make up the beds. I  think that   s about all I did.  How much did you get paid?  Well, enough to pay for my clarinet.  And you were in high school at that time?  I was getting ready to go into high school, I think.  How did you come about getting the band involved in the competition?  Well, the band director, after I bought my clarinet, he gave me lessons,  the band director did. Then, I participated in the band and we   well,  anyway, I was part of the band.  You were telling me earlier that you started a group and you would  compete with other people in the band. You played a modern music     Oh, yes. When we were in high school, this group, we got together and  won the contest. He wouldn   t let Madelyn and I play in the band festival  because of us winning the contest.  What did he not like about you winning it?  I don   t know what his idea was.  17  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Was it because you played modern music?  He didn   t like that. He wanted marches, marches with the bands  That   s  what the band was all about was marches. He didn   t like modern music.  Anyway, we played it. (Laughter) I forgot what it was, but it was a nice  band and we won the first prize. It was fun. (Laughter) He wouldn   t let  us play in the band festival and oh, boy  It didn   t bother me so much, but  boy, the Colberts, they were really upset over it.  Did they write an article in the paper about it?  Oh, yes  I kept that until just recently and I threw it away. I thought,     Oh, who   s interested in that?    I wish I had kept it.  Did you work at the paper?  I worked at the paper office.  What did you do there?  Well, I waited on people. We had cards. We sold cards and then in later  years, they taught me how to proofread.  What was the paper called?  It was a weekly paper and it was done on a big, metal machine. They fed  the paper into this machine.  And it was the NWO?  Yes, Northwest Oklahoman.  How many years did you work there?  Oh, my land  It was a lot of years. I always thought it was forty-one. I   m  not for sure.  What year did you start? Do you remember?  Well, I went down there and I   d help Mrs. Colbert do cleaning in the  store and then gradually, they asked me if I wouldn   t consider working  full-time. I think I worked for a dollar a day for a long time. Finally, I  told them I thought I needed a  raise, and  I asked them for a raise.  (Laughter)  18  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Did they give it to you?  A little bit of a deal, yes. It was quite a deal.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, it was just an ordinary acquaintance. It wasn   t a very good  marriage.  How many children do you have?  Just my son.  What   s his name?  Don. He was retiring while I was still working. (Laughter) When I went  to Tucson, he retired from Tucson, Arizona, where he was with YMCA.  He said,    My mother   s still working, and here I am, retiring.    I worked  quite a few years after that.  What year did you retire?   It was 2007 when I stopped working.  I know they had a retirement  party for me when I quit at the NWO.  I was eighty-nine years old when  I had a stroke in my eye and lost my vision.   Well, what are some things you   ve been doing since then?  Well, for three years now, I   ve had to go to Amarillo with my eyes. See,  I had the stroke and I have a hole in the retina in this eye and all I have  left is peripheral. I don   t have much sight left.  Do you still quilt?  No, I can   t. I can   t even sew, no. Not anymore, no more.  How often do you go to the senior center for lunch?  Well, I try to go once a week. Then on Tuesday, we eat pizza for free.  Pizza Hut gives their leftover pizza that people don   t pick up, orders.  They pick them up and then they warm them on Tuesday. So, we have  pizza, free pizza on Tuesday. It tastes pretty good   Yes, that sounds fun.  Yes, and anyway, it   s fun.  19  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  What about Shattuck, over the years? How has it changed?  Well, what has happened, it seems like, is the little stores closing.  Shattuck used to be a Saturday night town. Everybody came to town on  Saturday. We had the drug stores, we had the shops that stayed open,  cafes. People would buy their groceries on Saturday night. You know  how people gather on Saturday nights and visit. I know my mother  always had several ladies that she was anxious to visit with to get all the  news. (Laughs) The kids, they walked up and down the street, and oh,  dear  (Laughter) It was quite something.  Were there some movie theaters?  Yes, it was fun. Shattuck was a busy little town.  When did it start changing?  Well, I think it started changing when we had that first oil glut thing that  came in. People came in here from the east and they were going to   I  know I asked several people,    Why did you come to Oklahoma?       Well,  we came to the oil fields.    I said,    Oil fields?    (Laughter) To me, it was  almost a laugh. Then it kind of died down and it seemed like nobody had  any money to buy anything and boy, things got pretty rough  That   s  when it began to fizzle out.  Do you know what decade that was?  No. I know it has been ten to twelve years ago. I know it has been quite  a long time when that other oil glut came in. People came in from the  east to work in the oil fields. It was quite something.  Well, I wanted to ask you about the tornado in    47. Do you have  anything to say about that?  Oh, yes  When I was working at the telephone office at nights, when we  had that Woodward tornado, they came in. We lived up there in the  southwest part of Shattuck, up there by the hospital. I was washing  dishes and I looked out the kitchen window and I said,    Momma,    I  said,    It looks like we   re in for a storm. I think what I   m going to do is  I   m going to go to the movie. That way, I   ll just have half a block to  walk from the movie house to the telephone office.    Maybe just a little  over a block or half a block and so, I did. I went to the movie.  When I came out of that theater, apparently the tornado was passing  south of Shattuck. Anyway, I had to bend over, and  it was  hot  That  20  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  wind was the hottest  So, it was that close to the tornado.  Wow.  The Woodward tornado was that close to Shattuck when I came. So, I  went in and I told the girl that was working, I said,    Oh, it is so hot out  there and windy  Terrible  I don   t know what   s going on.     This was on  April 9, 1947.  Well, at eleven o   clock I took over because I was a night  operator and about twelve o   clock, people started pounding on the door,     You   ve got to let us in  We   ve got to make calls     Well, see,  Woodward was our main station to call out, report calls. Well, I couldn   t  get Woodward. I couldn   t get Arnett. I couldn   t get Follett. I couldn   t get  anybody  No town was available. So, finally, I called Perryton. I said,     Are you reaching outside?    She said,    Yes, what   s a matter?    I said,     We   ve had a storm here and people need to be notified.    I said,    Do  you suppose it   ll be all right if you handle some of my calls?    She said,     Well, what can we do?    I said,    I can   t get out anyplace. I can   t call  Woodward, I can   t call Lavern, I can   t call anybody, and people have to  be notified.     So, she placed all those calls for me. I said,    Well, if there   s something  wrong,    I said,    They   ll let us know in the morning.    Well, we never  heard another word. The calls were all completed. The people were  notified. Oh, it was horrible  Especially the people from Higgins and  Glazier,  Texas,  they were hurt so bad. The next morning I went home  and cried like a baby. I was so tired and so nervous. Momma had gone to  the hospital to help with patients up there. My chief operator didn   t show  up. Nobody came to help me and there I was, in that building and letting  strange people in at night. It was something that I wouldn   t want to  repeat. Then, they would tell me how people were hurt. Oh, my  It was  awful. Then other stories, and the next day, how people were hurt and  everything. I said,    Well, I   ve never felt such hot wind in my life.    And  I said,    I don   t supposed I ever will again    I haven   t since, because we  haven   t had too many. We haven   t had too many storms out in here.  What about in 1990?  There was one, yes. One came through Shattuck.  I think the library was     We were at my niece   s musical program in Alva. When we started home  from Alva, the lightening was horrible back in here  My brother said,     We   ve got to keep going.    He said,    We can   t stop any place. We   ve  got to get home to Shattuck and see what   s going on there.    Well, when  we got to Fargo, why, his wife wanted to stop. He said,    No, we better  21  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Wilson  keep going. If we get in a storm, okay,    he said,    But hopefully, we  won   t.    If the storm was travelling from, I think, south of Shattuck,  through Shattuck because it tore up some buildings.  When we got to the edge of Shattuck, they wouldn   t let us in. I said,     Oh     I said,    Where on earth will I sleep tonight?    So, finally, there  were some men there that knew my brother. He talked them into letting  us drive on into Shattuck. I lived here. As we came down this hill here,  my yard light was on. I said,    Oh, I   ve got yard light on.    I said,    I think  I have electricity, maybe I can get in my house.    Sure enough, my  garage door worked and I got in my house, but they had to go clear up  around the hospital to get over on the west side of Shattuck. They  couldn   t cross Main Street anyplace because the storm had gone down  Main Street. Yes, that   s when there was quite a bit of damage to the  buildings downtown. Because I know I was working, at that time, at  NWO.  So, I went down to the store the next morning and oh, my land  You  wouldn   t believe how dirty everything was. The dirt had just seeped in  that store. I turned around, went back home, and I said,    I   m not going  down there yet     So, finally, they called and said,    Maybe we can start  in and clean up the store.    Apple   s across the street was gone, Dairy  Cr  me was gone, the Shamrock Station was all messed up and gone, and  the glass shop or the gardens next door was all broke down, but we were  lucky. We didn   t have just a great a lot. Then, on down my street, there  were buildings that were damaged. Yes, that was about twenty years  ago, because Lisa was in a musical program at Alva.  After that, the community pulled together and rebuilt things that needed  to be rebuilt?  Yes, yes. Oh, that was quite a mess   Well, this sure seems like a strong community here in Shattuck.  Yes. And we   re building right now, quite a bit. We   re getting that big  truck stop  El Tipi . We have Alco now and the Dollar General store,  and the caf   reopened, so it   s doing pretty good.  Well, is there anything that I haven   t asked you about that you want to  talk anymore about?  I don   t think so. It   s just an ordinary life. I don   t like it. (Laughter)  Well, thank you for talking with me.  22  Livengood  Wilson  Livengood  Well, it   s nothing unusual. It   s just another life story. I just hope that I  don   t have to go to the rest home. I just hope I can continue being in my  home.  You seem to be doing really well   Well, thank you.  -------  -------
