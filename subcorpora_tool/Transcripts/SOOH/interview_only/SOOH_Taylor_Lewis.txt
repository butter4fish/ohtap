 Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is June 13th, 2009. We   re in Stillwater, Oklahoma and  we   re going to talk with Lewis Taylor regarding the 1930s in Oklahoma.  This is part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project. Thank  you for joining us today. Let   s get started by having you tell us a little  about your childhood, where you were born and we   ll work forward.  Well, I was born in Centrahoma  Oklahoma  down in Coal County; as  they used to say    Down in Choctaw.    My dad was a cattleman and we  moved around a lot. The first thing I can remember was probably in  1929 we were living over by Hickory on a small ranch and then we  moved into Hickory and that   s where I started to school. I started school  in the fall of 1930 before I was six in February of    31. As they say, the  rest is history. (Laughter)  Talk a little bit about the school house then.  It was a typical for the time school, everything in one building, a big  two-story rock building up the road about a mile or half a mile from the  house. I was only there for one term and then we moved on over back to  Centrahoma. I was there for a couple of years. And then we moved to  Jesse. We had a ranch down south in Jesse in 1933. That was strictly a  grade school. I rode a horse about five miles from the ranch into school  in Jesse. I tell my kids now it was uphill both ways. About six kids rode  horses. It was a little school. There were two teachers. First through the  fourth grade in one room and fifth through the eighth in the other. I kind  of like that system now that I think back on it because if you were ahead  of your class, you would listen to the lessons in the next class up ahead  of you and if you were behind you would listen to the class behind you  and eventually you would catch up on all of them. It was not bad. It was  not a bad system.  5  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  How many were in your class?  I would say, the best I can remember, there must have been about ten or  twelve in each class. It was one row down the whole length of the room  and I think you would get about ten or twelve desks down that row. I  was next to the wall and the others were two in the middle and the other  was on the other wall. The teachers were working back and forth with  everybody. It wasn   t bad.  What was your typical lunch?  Whatever we carried with us. I would generally have a biscuit and a  fried egg or a biscuit and ham and an egg and maybe cookies. That   s  about it. Whatever my mother put in the bag, I took.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  At that time I had one brother and two sisters. I had one brother that died  as an infant a year later. And then I had another brother born sometime  later. Four of us made it all the way to adulthood.  And your father farmed for his living or did something else?  Well he was a cattleman. We went broke in 1933. The parallels I   m  afraid I see now in this year and 1933 because Roosevelt had just come  in office and Hoover was gone thank goodness and everything   s going to  be fine now that Hoover   s gone and so everybody was real enthusiastic.  Prices starting going up a lot everywhere in March after Roosevelt came  in so my dad went down and bought his usual stock of steers and bought  1,000 head. By the fall those  40 steers were selling for  12.50 if you  could get somebody to buy them. The government was buying them up  for  12.50 and killing them   pushing them in a trench. So he did not  survive as a big rancher after that.  We moved into town, lived on a small ranch up near Ada for a year or so  and went to school in Latta. That didn   t work out well enough to keep  everything going, so we moved into town and he went to work for a  meat packing plant. The oil boom was on in Fittstown south of Ada,  Harden City and he was selling meat to the stores primarily in Fittstown  and Harden City and that general area south of Ada. So he did a little bit  of everything during the Depression until 1938 we moved back to the  mountains down in Pushmataha County. I went to high school in  Clayton then for three years and graduated from Clayton in 1941. At that  time, that was still open range country. Turned some cattle out and they  shifted for themselves and you   d put enough salt up around the house to  keep them coming up every once in awhile for salt. Just let them run  6  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  wild. If a car hit one on the road on the highway well he bought the steer  or the cow, if you could find him. He ran off   he   d hit the calf and kill it  and leave. You never even knew who did it. But if you happened to  catch it, the driver was responsible. All the cows would sleep in the  road. The drivers had to dodge them because it was open range. They  did away with that shortly after World War II, but at that time it was still  open range.  No fences?  No fences. Well, you built fences to fence livestock out of your crops. If  you grew crops or any kind of garden, you would build a fence around  it. You fenced livestock out. Ordinarily you build a fence to keep  livestock in. There it was to keep them out.  The roads were dirt?  Yes, the state highway going through there was a gravel highway. One  evening, late, a woman stopped by our house. We lived up in a little ol     tar paper shack up on the side of the road. She came up and said,    How  do I get back on the highway? I thought the road I was following on this  map up to Talihina was the state highway and I ended up on this gravel  road.    And I said,    Well this is the state highway. It is a gravel road.  You   re on it. Just keep driving.    (Laughs) She was not used to that  gravel.  A man up the road had a contract with the state to grade the  highway using a mule-drawn grader.   As a child could you tell the Depression was going on? Or did your  parents shelter you pretty much?  Oh, we knew things were not going well because   at least I was old  enough. I was the oldest of the children. I could tell. I don   t know about  the other kids. I knew because money had been rather plentiful and we  had lots of horses and lots of cows and lots of everything else we ever  wanted, a new car and all that and suddenly we didn   t have that  anymore. So yes, I knew there was a Depression. I did. Of course by the  time I was in the high school it was quite evident. Lots of people we  knew were working for the WPA. My dad never did do that, but nothing  wrong with the WPA, it kept a lot of people eating. We just never had to  do it. Times were not easy. I   m not sure we   re any better off now than  we were then though. At least we stayed in good physical condition  because we had to work hard. I remember the first paying job I ever had,  besides carrying newspapers in Ada for a little while, I was building  fence for a rancher down in Push County up in those mountains down  there and you worked from see to no see,  or sun up to sun down . I got  a dollar a day and my dinner. Pretty good money for a kid that   s 16  7  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  years old.  Did your mother work outside of the home?  No. Well, she worked outside the home for a few months. We lived in  Ada for a little while during the Depression and she worked outside for a  lawyer and a cotton buyer. She did not ordinarily work out for wages.   But she made a huge garden and canned most of what we ate.   Did she make your own clothes?  Oh yes. We bought  Gingham Girl  flour and used the gingham sacks  and she   d make underwear and dresses for my sisters and make shirts for  me on a treadle sewing machine, the same old Singer treadle that sat  there and she   d sew like crazy. Practically the only thing we bought for  food was coffee and sugar and salt and pepper and flour because we  raised our own meat and raised our own cornmeal and we canned  hundreds and hundreds of jars of stuff in the spring and summer. She   d  can a whole beef. When Daddy would kill a steer she   d can the whole  thing. Sausage and hams, he cured the hams, bacon and canned sausage.  You had a cellar then?  Yes. Oh yes. My dad was a firm believer in cellars. Everywhere we went  the first thing we would do after we got there was build a cellar. At least  that   s what it seemed like to me and at that time I spent half my time  running from possible cyclones and storms.  Did she also put her canned goods in the cellar?  A lot of them, yes. Had to put them somewhere where they wouldn   t  freeze.  Can you remember getting electricity for the first time?  Oh, I was not home when we got electricity for the first time. We had  moved down from the big ranch down on a smaller operation. We had  no electricity, no running water, no indoor plumbing, no anything. I  remember very well how it seemed like a great day in the morning when  I came home from school and they   d put a pump on the well. I didn   t  have to pull it up and down on the rope, there had been a rope and  bucket. I could pump it up with a hand pump, that was a big day, but the  electricity we did not get until after World War II. By that time we were  back in Centrahoma and Centrahoma had REA. But we survived very  well on kerosene lamps and lanterns. You didn   t think anything about it  because everybody else was in the same boat. And kids growing up,  8  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  whatever they see they assume that   s the way things are supposed to be.  It   s a long time before they look back and figure out just why things  were the way they were.  You have to eventually come to a realization that somebody had to work  to make it come out right. It wasn   t necessarily natural for things to be  the way they are. Somebody was working things out. I think it takes  most kids a long time to realize that. I had a lot of people help me along  the way. I didn   t really appreciate them much until later in life. After I  graduated from high school (that was in    41) I moved down to  Tishomingo to Murray College and went on to the Naval Academy and  on with the rest of my life. It all formed in the    30s when people were  helping me, especially the superintendent of schools and the American  Legion. They gave me a lot of boosts up and I appreciated it much too  late in life to really thank them properly. The old ranch where I rode a  horse to school has now been bought up by a rich guy from Texas who is  trying to turn it into an exotic game animal preserve. I was down there  not long ago and they have a huge fence around it to keep the buffalo  and the elk all in and all that. I was asking how many cattle he run     don   t run any cattle at all, it   s strictly a game range. Things are  changing.  Is the school still there?  No. Jesse   s school is long gone. There   s not even a sign of a building  there now. In fact I think there   s an oil distribution center or something  there now where the school used to be. There was one little store there  and now it   s long gone. And a lot of the houses.  What was the closest town where your mother would go get the flour and  the sugar?  Stonewall, down in the southeast part of Pontotoc County.  Then, in  Pushmataha County it was Antlers, 25 miles away.   What kind of things would you do for fun?  Oh, fish, I played a lot of marbles, both at school and at home, practicing  and playing and ride my horse, go crawdad fishing for crawfish for fun.  My granddad would come down and we   d go squirrel hunting every so  often. Generally whatever we could do by ourselves because there were  no other kids around. After we got up a little bigger, in the late    30s, by  that time I was playing team sports in school or out in the neighborhood.  I did an awful lot of fishing in the    30s, especially from    37 and    38 on.  We were living in the Kiamichi Mountains where there were lots of  streams to fish and I fished them.  And I used to read a lot.   9  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Did your father have to do some conservation efforts around the farm?  Not particularly that was required. There were things they wanted us to  do like build a trench silo which we did. But there was nothing in the  way of terracing or forced crop rotation going on. We were not in the  Dust Bowl so we didn   t have a wind break and things like that. That   s all  pine woods down there, you know. We did what we called new  grounding, quite a bit of that. We cleared it out and planted the garden,  pumpkins and watermelon and stuff like that. We had to grub the  sassafras sprouts out of the ground every year in the spring. It was not a  very big operation as far as farming is concerned. In fact, we raised our  own feedstock and corn primarily, and some peas.  Did you have a tractor or did you have to use a plow?  It was all horse drawn plows: Georgia stock, double-shovel, turning  plow, lister, cultivator   I run    em all. You never see one anymore. Part  of the time we had a car and part of the time we didn   t after we moved  down there. We always had horses and a wagon. One of the things we  did then and I don   t guess they do anymore was taking corn to the mill  to be ground. If we   d get low on cornmeal well, Mother would tell me to  go shell some corn to take to the mill. So I would go out to the barn and  shell up a quarter of a bushel or half a bushel of corn, put it in a  gunnysack or sack of some sort and take it up about two miles away  there was a little grist mill and it would run on a gasoline powered one  lunger engine. He would grind it and take a third so we ground it without  having to pay out any money, which we didn   t have. So that   s the way  we kept ourselves in cornmeal. Ate an awful lot of cornmeal mush in  those days, plain old mush, browned it in a skillet   it has a different  taste and texture when you brown it   brown mush in the skillet and boil  it and mix it up. I still make a bowl of mush every once in awhile.  I can   t say that I   ve ever had any.  It   s just cornmeal and water; four cups of water and one cup of meal and  boil it for about X minutes. It would take quite awhile.  Kind of like grits?  Well it   s finer than grits. It has a different taste to it. The lye that you use  with grits changes the taste a little bit.  Did you go to the war?  I went to the Naval Academy. I sweated out the war in Annapolis. I was  down in Tishomingo going to school and working in the college  10  cafeteria cooking when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. My college  roommate that I met down there, and took up with, had just gotten out of  the Navy   served four years in the Navy and came down to Murray to  go to school. He left and re-enlisted and went right back. I was there  working. Navy Sea Bees came through there shortly thereafter looking  for people and I tried to volunteer as a cook and they were going to sign  me up and they found out I was 16 years old and they wouldn   t take me.  So I stayed put. Then I tried to join the V5, the Navy V1 program where  you start out in officer training and you work your way up to pilot, V5  and V12 programs they had to train the naval aviators. So I signed up for  that and they took me to Oklahoma City for a physical exam. Well my  tonsils were rotten and bad, and my teeth were about as bad and they  said,    Well son, you   re alright but we can   t take you in this shape. If you  want to get your tonsils out and your teeth fixed well then come back.     By that time I was 17, I guess.  So I went home and my folks were in California working the war plants  by that time. They sent me the money and I had my teeth fixed, all filled  and had my tonsils taken out. I was sitting around fat, dumb and happy. I  expressed a desire while I was in high school to do the Service Academy  because I knew I wasn   t going to get to go to school any other way. I  was in one of the engineering buildings down there at Murray and there  was a guy from Ardmore that got an appointment to the Naval Academy,  but he was not going to go because he wanted to get married and if he  got married he couldn   t go. So rather than going to the Academy he got  married, taking his chances on the war somewhere else. I was standing  there at his drawing desk, at a drafting table, and I said,    Boy, they  better not offer me one of those appointments. I   d go in a minute.    And  just as I said that a guy came to the top of the stairs and said,    Butch you  got a long distance phone call.    And I said,    See there   s my appointment  right now.    Well it turned out it was  (Laughs) My superintendent in  high school had gotten it arranged for me to go through the college.  One of the guys who I   d never really   I did tell him, but I never really  did tell him I appreciated what he did. His name was A.D. Patton. He  was the acting president of the college at Murray, while everybody was  off at war. We found out that when we got all the papers from the  Academy that if I had enough of the right types of college credit I  wouldn   t have to take any entrance examinations. Well we went over the  list of everything that I had there in two years at Murray and I had  everything on the list except English literature. I needed a semester of  English lit. Well, they weren   t offering that that term. It was the first  term of the year and not the second. So Patton says,    Louie, we won   t let  that stand in the way. You just come in my office about three or four  times a week and we   ll have an English class.    So he tutored me.  11  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  So after you graduated from the Academy what did you do?  By that time the war was over, in    46. We were a three year class  because of the war. My eyes were bad, I couldn   t see the charts, so they  discharged me for physical disability. So I went home and went to work  for Public Service Company of Oklahoma in McAlester as an electrical  engineer and the Korean War started and they didn   t much care if I  could see the chart or not so I went back in as a Civil Engineer Corps  officer and I served ten years in the Civil Engineer Corps. Got out and  did some research and development work in communications. Then  Vietnam came along so I went to Vietnam with the Agency of  International Development with the State Department. I stayed out there  six years trying to help the civilian government, then eventually retired  from USAID and since then have just kind of knocked around. I   ve done  a lot of contract consulting and things like that.  You said your parents worked in the factories during the war?  Defense plants, yes, in California.  Doing what sorts of things?  Mother was working in an aircraft plant and my dad was working in the  place where they built what they called the Duck, one of those  amphibious tractor things.  How did they get there from Oklahoma?  Well, they just went. I can   t remember the exact sequence because I was  down in Tishomingo. At the end of my first year at Tishomingo, they  had moved out of the mountains because Daddy was getting older   he  was quite a bit older than my mother and he didn   t feel like he could  look after the place without me there to help him. So they moved from  there to a farm down in Antlers with a friend of my dad   s. And I went  home, I stayed at Murray in the summer of    42. Instead of going  anyplace, I stayed at Murray and cooked for the NYA. They had a bunch  of NYA students in their training them. Are you familiar with NYA?  Yes.  The National Youth Administration. They were training them in sheet  metal work, welding and machine shop, and I was their cook. I took a  weekend off one time and went down to Antlers and my folks were still  down there in the summer of    42. By May of    43 they were in California  but I don   t remember exactly when and how they got there. When school  was out at Murray in May of    43, I know that I had to be at the Academy  12  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  on the fifth of June in    43. About the first week of May school was out,  so I went out there, they were in California and I got a job picking  lemons. To go to the Academy I had to have  300 minimum in cash. I  was supposed to have, I think,  1100, but if I had  300 they would loan  me the rest of it and take it out of my pay as time went on. So I picked  enough lemons to make my  300 before I left to go to Annapolis.  So they migrated for other reasons than the Dust Bowl; they went to  California for work.  They went out there strictly to work in the defense plants. By the time  the war was over they were back in Centrahoma.  Didn   t stay long.  Some of my dad   s folks went back way before the Dust Bowl. They  were back there in the late    20s, I guess, some of my dad   s people. So  we always had connections and family out there. They went strictly  because of the war plants.  How old did your parents live to be?  My dad was 85 and my mother was 83.  For hard work that   s pretty good.  I tell people about diet; my dad ate ham and eggs and biscuits and gravy  every morning for 85 years and it finally killed him.  He worked hard though to work all that off.  Worked hard. He was a good cowboy. My grandparents moved to  Norman when the university was organized, they live out in Blanchard  over by the river some place. They came up from Texas, but they moved  into Norman so the kids could go to the University. I think there were  five of them, but none of them ever went to university. My dad went  through the fifth grade and left, went off from home to be a cowboy. He  was a good cowboy, a good cow puncher. Rope, ride, whatever it took.  He left I think he said in the fifth grade.  And then all of his children went on to do education to some extent?  Yes. My sister, just younger than I, got married when she was 17 and  didn   t go past high school. My sister next down went to Murray and then  went to East Central and then up here to Oklahoma State or maybe  OU   there   s several of these state schools. She ended up teaching in  13  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Ardmore. She and her husband taught at the Ardmore Public Schools, I  think, for 30 years and then retired and moved to Abilene, Texas. My  brother, the youngest one, was 13. He was 11 years younger than I. All  he ever wanted to do was drive a truck and that   s what he did from when  he was 12 or 13 years old until he died. He had a stroke and died about  three years ago. He was good, I guess. He was a member of the Million  Mile Club and had a certificate where the state legislature of Missouri  had commended him for his contribution to the industry. He was good at  it, but that   s just all he ever wanted and that   s what he did.  Did your mother ever quilt?  Oh yes, always had a quilt going, had a frame that hung from the ceiling.  Have you seen these that drop down and you work around them and they  roll them up and have a thing about this wide to keep working on it?  Always ran it through and hoist it back up out of the way. Oh yes, she  did a lot of that. That was what women were supposed to do or mothers  were supposed to do. Most of the time I was at home she did our clothes  on a rub board and boiled them in a cast iron pot over the wood fire. One  of my jobs was to keep wood available there to stick under the fire when  she boiled the clothes. I cut lots of wood for everything   heating,  cooking, and used that same pot to render lard at hog killing time.  What about bath time?  That was in a number three wash tub in the kitchen. Heated the water up  in the stove.  What   s a number three tub?  It   s a big wash tub.  Round or oblong?  Round. About so big around, so deep.  They came in different sizes?  Oh yes. That was a bigger one. We did those at least once a week,  sometimes twice but not anymore than that.  How was winter time during those days?  About like it is now. You just had to burn a lot of wood to keep warm. I  tell people every time we have one of these snow storms drive in here it  reminds me of why I went to college. I don   t have any cows to milk. It   s  14  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  no fun milking cows in the wintertime, I   ll tell you that.  So you had to do that?  Oh, yes. Sure.  How early would you have to get up?  Oh, we   d be up around 6:00 or 6:30 to get our breakfast to get the  milking done and the hogs fed and catch the school bus. When we were  down in Clayton we rode the school bus 15 miles.  Did they have 4-H or FFA back then?  Yes they did, but I was never very active in that. I looked into a little bit  when I was about 15 and bought a pig to raise and show at the County  Fair. And then I got malaria and wasn   t able to do much with it. My  sisters took care of it and fed it and that   s all, we never did show it.  That   s as far as I got into it, not beyond that. Boy Scouts was pretty big  for me. I walked that 15 miles a few times to get home. Going fishing I  walked everywhere. I   d wade at the creek, walk a mile or two and get in  the creek and wade for a mile or two down the creek and walk home  with a string of fish. That   s just the way you did things, you walked. If  you were going any distance back in the hills then we would take the  horse, but not very often.  Did the town have a movie theater?  Clayton had a movie theater. I never had anybody to go with. The only  time I went to a movie was during school and they took us down to show  us Gone With the Wind. It was a part of one of our classes.  That was about the time it was out.  I can   t remember ever going to any other movie.  Did you have a radio at home?  No.  So you didn   t listen to the fireside chats?  No, when we were in Ada for a couple of years we had a radio   we had  electricity then, we had radio. I can   t remember any of the president   s  speeches. I can remember Jack Armstrong, All-American Boy, and  Navy Bob Steele, going home and listening to them.  15  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Baseball games?  Some. Not too much. I didn   t listen to too much of the ball games. Used  to listen to The Shadow, Lamont Cranston,    Who knows? The Shadow  knows.    Those kinds of radio programs. I did not hear War of the  Worlds, the one that scared everybody to death on  October 30,  1938. I  think I was in junior high school. The one Orson Welles put on scared  everybody to death, of an invasion. I did not hear that. I didn   t know  anything about it until the next day when I got to school and everybody  was talking about it. When we had a radio, it was a big part of the  activity or family gathering, but that was just for a little while in Ada  because a vast majority of the time we had nothing like that.  Telephone?  In Ada, we had a telephone. Did we? No, we didn   t, at least not much of  the time. The neighbors next door had a phone and they would call us to  the phone that somebody had called for us. I don   t remember ever  having a telephone except for a little while in one of the places.  Do you remember when The Grapes of Wrath book came out?  Not very well. I just knew about it. I didn   t read it or anything like that.  It created a little bit of a stir, but I didn   t pay much attention to it. One of  the main things that I remember was that he got the geography all wrong  in the state of Oklahoma, Steinbeck did.  I haven   t heard that. How much wrong?  Well, he had Shawnee placed in the wrong place and Tahlequah,  Spavinaw. He got it where you go right by each other, right next door.  I   ll tell you if you want a good book on the Dust Bowl. We were on our  side of the state, we weren   t in the Dust Bowl. The Worst Hard Times is  a good book to read on that.  It   s good, yes.  What precipitated the migration to California, most of it came from the  eastern part of the state. I can remember in the    30s there around  Centrahoma and Coal County where just about every quarter section had  a house on it and family and kids. Some of them were sharecroppers,  some of them were leasing land, some of them owned the land. But  when they began industrializing farming and the cattlemen wanted the  land back to run cattle, they pushed a lot of people off the land because  they could do it more economically with tractors than they could with  people and horses and mules or they could make better running cattle.  16  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  That precipitated an awful lot of move to California from eastern  Oklahoma. I can remember around places, I go back there now and I can  remember there used to be a house over there. Instead of fields of cotton  and things like that it   s all cattle   it   s all pasture.  When I was in grade school in Centrahoma, we had two cotton gins. One  of them had already quit working, but they still had one cotton gin  working. They had two filling stations, a restaurant. The bank had just  closed when I can remember. It was the mid-   20s so the bank had just  closed. Still had a hardware store, a big hardware store, and a lumber  yard and a drugstore and a doctor there. We had a big country general  store like you see in the movies, with everything up on the shelves. My  aunt was the post mistress, and there were about four or five other  grocery stores besides the big general store. That was all there in    31,     32,    33 and then it just gradually began to fade away as time went on.  Some of it was still there after World War II. The filling station was still  there, and there was one grocery store still there after World War II.  What   s there now?  Let   s see, a community center, a post office, and a bunch of people,  retirees.  Was it unusual for a woman to be head of the post office?  No, not unusual.  How long did she do that?  Oh, lord.  (Laughs) A long time, huh?  Let me think, from about 1930 to 1964, something like that.  Thirty-some years. At the same place?  Yes. Whenever she would be sick or have to go anywhere, Mother  would run it for her. She was gone from there for about a year or two.  She moved to Ada   her husband was a railroader on the OCA A, it ran  from Oklahoma City to Ada and Atoka, through there. And then moved  to Ada for a year or two, but she moved back and went right back to the  post office. I don   t know how they worked it, but when I was little, five  or six years old, she was already in the post office and had been for  awhile.  17  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  And what was her name?  Vesta Craig. She was the end and the beginning of   in fact she was  there almost to the end of the post office. Somehow they saved  Centrahoma post office. They were supposed to combine it with Tupelo,  but they still had it unless they just closed it just recently.  Did it have a train depot?  They did when I was a kid. They used to have what they called a dinky,  it was a little diesel-powered, single car. They ran that thing as a  passenger train. When we lived in Ada, I would ride that thing down  there to see my aunt, on the dinky. In    32, my dad shipped a whole  trainload of cattle out on that railroad. He ordered the cars in and the  way he did it was you just order however many cars you wanted and  load them up and they   d haul them away. So they had pretty good sized  stock yards, had to have to hold that many cattle. All of that was gone by  the end of World War II or shortly after. They deregulated railroads of  course, along with everything else, and a lot of those old branch lines  went out.  You remember how much that might have cost him to have his cattle  shipped?  No. No idea, whatsoever. About that time, in Centrahoma that year I  remember him going down to the telephone office   we didn   t have a  phone at the house, I don   t think. Some people had a switchboard and  ran it as a party line-type operation and an operator would take it over  and plug it in. He went down there to make long distance phone calls.  He would call Oklahoma City and St. Louis and Kansas City checking  the market before he shipped. I can remember him going down to the  telephone office to have them place a long distance phone call for him to  check the market.  It was good business sense to do that?  Oh yes, sure, checking the market.  There wasn   t a newspaper to do that?  There was, but not current. We used to get the Oklahoma Stockman, but  I think it was a weekly. It gave all the market conditions and was  published in Oklahoma City. He did that pretty religiously. He got  sucked in on that rejuvenation of the economy in    33 and I   ve seen so  many parallels between that and what   s happening right now and it  worries me. They had a program sort of like what they   re doing here  18  Finchum  now. They called it the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Apparently,  and I   m not an expert on it, but apparently its main objective, the reason  it was set up, was to save the banks which is what they   ve been doing  here. My dad had leveraged out and had quite a bit of money and he  borrowed some more from the bank in Ada to buy his cattle in the spring  of    33. Well when the market for cattle was obvious by the summer that  they were going to tank out, the bank told Daddy,    I sold your note to  the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Wichita.    So the bank got  their money in what would now be called    toxic assets.    The man from  Reconstruction Finance was holding it.  So he went up to Wichita to talk to them about it and they reviewed the  situation, what the market had done, how much he had in the cattle and  all that. And he said,    Obviously these things are not going to pay for  themselves.    He said,    I   ll tell you what I can do, I will sell them for  whatever they bring. They   ll bring something, I don   t know what. But  whatever they bring, I   ll take that money. My steers are all top grade,  that   s all I buy are good steers and these are all A-1 stock. But I will take  the money and go to Louisiana and buy a bunch of coasters.    He could  buy what he called coasters, cattle, lower grade.    I can buy twice as  many coasters down there as this. You roll my note over and you can  carry it another year for twice as many cattle as you are now.    They  talked about this for awhile and some guy said,    You   re just a broke  down old cattleman now. You can go home and sell-out.    And he said I  told them,    Well alright. You get whatever money they bring and that   s  all the money you   ll ever get out of me. That   s all I   ll have to give you,  to bring. You   ll never get the rest of it.    So that   s what he did.  Well a month later after he got rid of all his land and his hay and shipped  a bunch of stuff, they called him back up there and said,    We   ve  reconsidered and we believe we will accept your proposal, it   s makes  sense. We   re just driving too many cattlemen over the wall.    And my  dad said,    Well it   s too late. I don   t have any place to put them now. The  land is all gone. The feed is all gone, everything. We couldn   t take care  of it.    And he said,    What happened to that old guy that made me sell-out  in the first place?    He said,    We had to get rid of him, he was  breaking everyone in the state.    He was running everybody out of  business. So the thing that worries me now is that the government is  intent on saving the banks, but what they   re doing to save the customers  of the banks leaves something to be desired, I think, the best I can tell.  So I see the parallel. I just hope it doesn   t turn out that bad, but it very  well could. Everybody thinks things are going up right now and then, if  suddenly the bottom drops out like it did in the summer of    33, there   s  going to be a lot of blood on the water around here.  Oklahoma is a little bit better off than some places, at the moment.  19  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Finchum  Taylor  Well, we were then. After the big crash in    29, he made money every  year    31,    32, doing exactly the same thing he did in    33, buying in the  spring with calves and shipping steers in the fall. He told me there, he  said,    You know there used to be an old adage among cow men,    You  can   t go broke buying yearlings and selling two year old steers.    I could  have done it.     Well, when he went to Wichita, how would he get there?  He went on the train. He didn   t look forward to driving with the  condition of the roads at that time in the kind of cars we were in. We had  a Model A at that time. Those times were tough on my parents, of  course. I didn   t realize how tough it was on them. The older you get, I  can appreciate it now that I   m older. I don   t know anything else of any  importance I can tell you unless you have something to ask me.  No, I   ve covered most of what I   ve got on here. The last thing was just  are there any lessons that you learned during that time period that you  still practice today?  Well, I don   t really know. I try not to get in debt I can   t pay or pay pretty  quick. My credit cards get paid every month. I don   t like to be leveraged  out like he was. If you don   t bet big, you don   t make it big, but you  don   t lose big either. I saw him get burned so badly and I didn   t want to  do it. After his funeral, one of the ranchers down there in Coal County     all of that land down there that was for farming is now ranch. One of the  ranchers came to me right after the funeral, about two or three days after  the funeral and apologized about not being there and said,    I was out in  New Mexico running cows and I couldn   t get back. He was sure a good  cowman. He always had the best horses in the county. The first steer I  ever roped was off one of his horses.    That was about as good a thing  one cowman could say about another.  Sure. Well if you don   t have anything else we   ll sign off and say thank  you for sharing your stories. It   s been great.  Okay. You   re welcome.  -------  -------
