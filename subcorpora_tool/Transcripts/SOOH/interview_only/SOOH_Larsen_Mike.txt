 Little Thunder  Larsen  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, November  2, 2010, and I   m interviewing Mike Larsen as part of the Native Artist   s  Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  the OSU  Library . I really appreciate you taking the time to visit with  me, Mike. I was privileged to interview you for Southwest Start many  years ago, and it   s really nice to check back in and see how your art and  career have grown.  Thank you.  You were born in Dallas and spent some of your early years there and in  Wynnewood, Oklahoma.  I was born in Dallas, and pretty much immediately we moved to  Wynnewood, Oklahoma, and stayed there until 1956, when we all went  to Amarillo, Texas. I started junior high school there, went through high  school in Amarillo.  Your maternal grandparents, I guess, played a pretty important role in  your life. How did they impact you?  Well my mother   s parents lived in Wynnewood and I lived with them;  my brother and I lived with them for awhile. I   m not exactly  sure  how  long, but two or three years we lived with them, and then were reunited  with my mother. She had to stay in Dallas and work, and they were very  influential, I think, in my life.  They were  a farm couple, and they were  elderly when I lived with them. I was very happy about that time.  So you got to do quite a few chores? (Laughs)  I got to do pretty much whatever I wanted to.  5  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  I see. What was your first art experience you remember as a young  child?  I don   t remember art experiences as a young child. I can   t bring anything  to mind, as a child.  Your tribe is Chickasaw. Was that on your mom or your dad   s side of the  family?  My dad   s side.  Did you have any exposure to them when you were young?  To?  To your dad   s side of the family.  No, my dad left us when I was a baby, actually, so I didn   t spend any  time with him until I was a teenager. So there was no relationship there,  no contact with the tribe, until I made it on my own as a teenager.  How about junior high art? High school art? Were you taking some  classes then?  Well, I was really getting into art. I was doing a lot of drawing on my  own in junior high and high school. I was fortunate in high school that as  a senior, like everybody did, I took an easy course because I needed an  easy credit. Everybody was taking art class, and so this art class at  Tascosa High in Amarillo offered pretty much unrestrained periods of  creativity   whatever we wanted to do, and all the materials that we  could hope to find. So it was very enlightening. I went from high school  into college, and since I didn   t have a clue about what I wanted to do, I  majored in art.  So you had enjoyed your art classes, but there were other interests you  had?  Yeah. She was blonde and Baptist. (Laughter)  I read that you had a bout with polio as a child. Did that affect the way  you saw or experienced things around you?  You know, it   s hard to define exactly how my thinking or my  experiences might have been changed by that. Understand, I was  naturally right-handed. I had polio when I was three, and it affected my  right arm and hand. So I had to develop my left hand, and everything I  6  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  have done since then, creatively or manipulative ly , have been with my  left hand, which changed my thinking as I understand  it .  We   re all cross-wired a little. I was wondering if it impacted your  sensibility.  My sensibilities. You mean, the way I see and look at things? It   s  difficult to say, from my point of view. People might look at me and say,     Well, you see things this way or that.    But I can   t perceive that myself.  I do tend to look at my paintings, and I see that since I do paint left-handed,  that my paintings   the people in my paintings   tend to go that  way. (Laughs)   Move in  that direction?  Which is interesting, because when I look at the painting, they are  moving to the right, but from the people in the paintings    point of view,  they   re moving to the left. Do you see? I think that   s kind of interesting.  That is really interesting. Once you enrolled   was it at the junior  college in Amarillo?  Yes.  And you started off taking art classes, was that also a good experience?  It was a really good experience. We had a really good director of the art  department. He was from Washington, D.C. A very strange man, but he  was very creative. He got me into sculpture, which I had never really  experienced, and again, we had all the materials that we could use, and  models, and it was quite fun, but very enlightening.  So you were actually doing clay figures?  Clay figures. We had models that we would do busts and things like that,  so it provided me with that opportunity real quickly in a school setting. I  still had to do my academics, and I was not very good at that, but the art  building they had was instilled with wonderful things. That   s where I  tended to spend all my time. That   s why my academics were so bad.  (Laughter) I think that   s pretty common, too.  Yes, I think it is. You were thirty-six when you decided to go to the Art  Students League. Had you saved money to go there, or how did you  manage to get there?  I had saved up a goodly amount of money because I was making a good  7  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  living at the time with festivals and art shows, and so I was able to take  off the time that I spent up there without really worrying about it. As  expensive as New York City is, I was able to do that. I was very  fortunate.  And it was an unusual set up in terms of a school?  The Art Students League is an art school. It   s not an academic school.  They don   t care if you go to class. You pay your fee, monthly, for the  number of instructors you want to take, and you go if and when you  want, and you do the work, go to the classes, come and go as you please.  They just didn   t care. Very New York.  (Laughs) But that worked well for you?  It worked well for me. I have always been disciplined with that kind of  thing, so I knew I had to do it, and I wanted to do it, so I didn   t waste  any of the time I had up there.  And one of your teachers was David Leffel?  My primary instructor was David Leffel, but also, at the time, Dick  Goetz from Oklahoma City was teaching there, so I was able to spend a  lot of time with Dick. I didn   t get to take classes from him, but he and I  spent a lot of time together. We   ve always liked each other, and so that  was good. I knew somebody up there. David Leffel had been down here  in Oklahoma City for a workshop, and I took the workshop and  discovered that he was doing things that I needed to learn how to do.  And so I followed him about a year later to New York and up to the Art  Students League.  Leffel is a realist. What kinds of things did you learn from him that  helped you?  Because  in a way, you ended up breaking free of that kind  of realism.  The reason I went to New York was to learn paint quality. In the work  that I was doing, I was missing that particular aspect. I was coming to  realize the paintings that I was doing, even though they were selling and  this and that, they were not pleasing me. There was something missing,  and it was that quality of paint that I was after. That   s why I went to  New York to go to school, at my old age. (Laughter)  How would you define paint quality?  Well, it   s a technique, but it has a lot to do with brushwork. The  paintings that I had done before, even though they were on panel or  8  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  canvas, were as flat as a watercolor would be. And I wanted to get away  from that. I felt like there was something physically, visually missing  from my paintings, and it was that quality of seeing brushwork on a  canvas, and the way paint moves and rises from a canvas, and moves  and blends with another color next to it. I love that. The paintings that  Martha and I collect, if you   ll look at them, have that quality. They   re  mostly landscapes, like Walt Gonske, the way he used to paint. Had  really wonderful paint quality in the things that he did. I   m afraid he   s  been tasting his paint. (Laughter)  You mentioned going to the Met, and in particular, a Van Gogh exhibit  that really inspired you.  Yeah, I went to the Metropolitan  a lot  because   it wasn   t cheap. You  still had to pay to get in, but it was cheaper than anything else up there  you could do, and there was a Van Gogh retrospective there. Hundreds  of his paintings. And they were all hanging in chronological order, so  that you could watch the rise and fall of the man   s insanity as he went  through his life. Beautiful, absolutely gorgeous paintings and we were  able to stand close enough to them so that you could see the quality of  the paint on the canvas. You could tell he was painting out of doors,  because there would be flowers and dust and grass mixed in with the  paint.  So when you came back to Oklahoma, you began doing shows again.  Did that immediately take off for you?  No, it took about a year or so for me to gather my thoughts and apply  some of what I was using up there. I discarded some of what I was  learning because it didn   t apply to what I wanted. The biggest thing that  I gave up was giving up painting in oil paints. When I came back here, I  went right back to acrylics, which I still paint with, and really do love as  a medium. So I had to get rid of some of the things that I had learned up  there, because you cannot treat oil paints the same way you treat  acrylics. I had to overcome some technical problems. Took me awhile.  Tell me about how, and when, you met Martha.  I met Martha for the first time at the Oklahoma City Arts Festival when  it was at the Civic Center downtown. She came through with a friend of  hers   Greg Burn   s wife, Pat   and she introduced us because Martha  was a picture framer, and I was a painter, and so we could do business  together. At the time, Martha was married, and I was   well, I had just  gotten a divorce from my first wife. As it turns out, Martha in the next  year or so went through that same divorce thing with her husband. It was  after a period of a year or so that we got together, and she started  9  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  framing my pictures, and five years later, we got married.  You had cultivated some gallery relationships, but I understand they  were not in Oklahoma, once you came back.  No, the galleries that I was associated with were in Santa Fe or in  Taos   the Gallery A in Taos, and the Wadle Gallery in Santa Fe, and  there were a couple of other galleries out there   I can   t bring their  names to mind. They have since closed, so it really doesn   t matter.  (Laughter)  So you were doing Native subject matter with this quality of paint that  you had evolved for yourself. Were you incorporating landscapes at all  in those paintings yet, or were they more expressionistic?  During that period in the early    80s, most of the things that I was doing  were figurative, with not much of a background. The landscapes  gradually creeped in, as we were going more and more out to Santa Fe,  that wonderful color out there. The landscapes, for a period of time,  overtook the figures and then they kind of came back together and  worked  As a unit again.  As a unit.  You did win first place at the Red Earth Arts Festival. How did that feel?  That was the best experience that we have had, from winning a prize. It  was 1987 and the first year for Red Earth, and we won the first Grand  Award. The greatest thing about it was that the judges for that show  were Alan Houser and Dick West. And from that time, which was the  first time I met Alan Houser, we became quite good friends, and it lasted  until he died, and that was very wonderful.  I was wondering what Native artist had impacted you, and Alan Houser,  I guess, would be one.  I think he would be the one. There are a lot of aspects of Indian art that  don   t appeal to me. I like to look at them, and I like to study them as  historic upbringing, or whatever you want to call it, because they were  very important. The ledger paintings. I mean, how can you beat those?  But I look at those, not necessarily as wonderful art, but as bites of  history that appeal to me. Over the years, we have become painters of  history, and so you look at those things, and you just have to admire  them. I like to look at them. They don   t appeal to me to do.  10  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  They   ve already been done. (Laughs)  They   ve already been done.  It   s interesting how each generation has its own recording of history to  do. In 1991 you received a commission from the State Arts Council to  paint the Five Indian Ballerinas from Oklahoma, which you called     Flight of the Spirit.    How did you approach that project?  Well, we initially were approached by the State Arts Council  director ,  Betty Price, to participate with a group of other artists. I don   t remember  exactly how many there were   five or six other artists   to do a proposal  for an area in the Capitol, which was in one of the Rotunda   s half-circles.  Twenty-two feet long, twelve feet high. Interesting shape. They  were pretty loose, which is a good thing. What they asked us to do was a  proposal based on these Five  Indian  Ballerinas. That was it. So it left  us a lot of leeway, and we came up with a good idea, I think, and as it  happens the proposal that we did was on a panel, twelve by twenty-four,  I believe. Twelve inches by twenty-four inches. Not real large, but that   s  kind of what they wanted, with the half circle drawn inside it, and then  the painting.  As it turns out, on that ominous Saturday night, I had that panel on my  easel, and Martha and I were going to go down the next day and I was  going to sign it. Then the following day, which would have been a  Monday   two days next, would have been a Monday   we were going  to go and turn our painting into the Arts Council for their consideration.  That Saturday night at eleven o   clock, my studio burned down. Burned  up that painting along with the studio. (Laughs) So that was an  interesting night. We didn   t have any time to waste, so Sunday morning  I got on the phone with Betty, and she knew about it because it was on  TV. She didn   t know my painting was there, but we talked to Betty, and  got a two-day extension for turning in our proposal. So the very next  day, which was a Sunday, we went to Hobby Lobby. No, it wasn   t  Hobby Lobby. I forget where we went and bought the materials we  needed, and I painted the proposal again on our kitchen table, since I  didn   t have a studio.  (Laughs) Wow.  And we turned it in. We were fortunate, and won the competition. I  think you would know some of those other people who were competing.  But it was the Five Ballerinas on stage, and surrounding them were  members of their particular tribe, man and woman, behind each of the  ballerinas. There were little ballerinas on each end, and back in the  11  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  background was a portrayal of the Trail of Tears, and like I said before,  it kind of reminded me of that first commission that Alan Houser did at  Haskell.  Oh?  Remember he told them he was a wonderful sculptor? He   d never  sculpted anything. (Laughter) Well, I   d never done a big painting like  this, and it was quite a challenge, and took us about six months to do.  It   s trial by fire too because of the curvature. It   s challenging enough to  do a mural, and you   re dealing with a curve.  Yeah, the shape of the canvas we had to work with provided some  interesting compositional problems. But it was interesting because we  were able to overcome that really quickly with the Five Ballerinas,  because we re-created the half circle with them, within the canvas. So  putting everything around them worked out pretty well.  That was a wonderful way to handle that. You   ve since done a number of  murals. Are you to the point where it   s not intimidating anymore to take  on a mural?  I really enjoy it. I   ve come to over the years really enjoy working on  large canvases, painting people life-size, or bigger. And it has proven to  be a benefit because there aren   t that many people who are willing to  paint large paintings. So we have slipped into kind of a group, I guess,  that when large paintings need to be done, we   re considered.  And do you start with drafts? Sketching preliminaries that are regular  size?  Yeah, we do preliminary studies that are relative to the size of the large  paintings, and they   re all on smaller canvases  that  we have to have for  approval.  Going back to the fire in your studio, I understand that was a turning  point for you career-wise and in terms of some decisions you made in  your personal life. Can you explain how that impacted you?  The fire was kind of cathartic, in a way. I was quite mad for about a day,  or less, but then realized pretty quickly that wasn   t going to get me  anywhere and thought about it. We were really fortunate because a  friend of ours, Tim Pillow in Oklahoma City, had a building about a  block away from where my old studio was, and he offered it to me, for  my use, as long as I needed it, so I was able to quickly get into a studio  12  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  space. And we determined really quickly that I needed to make some  changes   had needed to make some changes   and  that  this was the  time to do it. The color palette that I had been using for the last twenty  years, I dispensed with. It was filled with earth tones, earth colors,  yellows, browns, blacks, and I still use those colors, but added to those  colors now are bright yellows and bright reds and green. I thought I  would never use green. (Laughter) And I have discovered you can do a  lot with green. You can make an incredible black with green, and  alizarine crimson, and it makes black, boost full-color. It   s amazing.  Wow.  Anyway, I made these decisions to dispense with those colors, and that  palette, move on, paint much, much larger. I had fallen into the trap of  painting what I knew would sell. We had settled into canvas sizes of  twelve by twenty-four   small canvases   and the repetitiveness of that  was getting on my nerves and making me worry because I knew it  wasn   t going to last. So I got away from that, and we took a risk. We  stopped painting for the market. There is that term I read somewhere.  We started creating our own market, and it took awhile, but it worked.  So we developed into a particular style, for lack of a better word, and it  incorporates very large canvases and lots of color.  Was that also the time when you thought about moving out of state?  Well, Martha and I had decided that as soon as our last child went to  college, moved out of the house, that we were going to get the hell out of  Dodge. We had been living in Oklahoma City for thirty years, both of  us, and we wanted something else. So we decided that we were going to  move into the county. We thought about moving to Taos, which is where     artists    live, and we dispensed with that after one day of being there  driving around and discovering there were no zoning laws in Taos, New  Mexico.  I didn   t know that.  Yeah, don   t ever move there. It   s a wonderful place to visit, but I  wouldn   t want to live there. Then we found a wonderful, beautiful place  in south Colorado, south and west of Colorado Springs, in the Wet  Mountain Valley. A beautiful, beautiful place, and we tried really hard  to move there. And we looked in Cody, Wyoming. We went up there  and stayed there for a month and thought about that, until we discovered  that the winters up there last about seven months. (Laughter) So we  dispensed with that. And we were driving back from somewhere,  probably from an art show or something, and I looked at Martha and she  looked at me, and said,    What in the hell are we doing? We have  13  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  overlooked something. We have overlooked Oklahoma.     So we came back home, and we put out feelers with several realtors, up  to Perry and Chandler, in through all this area, and as it turns out, the  realtor from here in Perkins called us and said,    I   ve got forty acres.  Maybe you want to come look at it.    So we came out here, and fell in  love with it, and bought it, and Perkins went with it. We didn   t know  about Perkins, but we love it out here.  It   s been a good place to do your art.  Been a good place to live, and do art. I don   t rely on people to walk into  the studio and buy things. That happens, but we don   t need to live in the  city. People come up here from the city, or from Tulsa, or they call.  They come from different places, but it really doesn   t matter where you  live.  How did your project of portraying the Chickasaw elders come about?  We have become friends over the years with Bill Anoatubby, Governor  of the Chickasaws   a very wonderful man. And Martha and I have  talked for years and years and years about a way to paint some of the  people that we had seen down at Ada, Tishomingo, and around. I don   t  remember exactly how we came up with the overall idea, but I went  down one day and talked to Bill. I said,    Bill, I would like       (Bill in  private) (Laughter)    Governor Anoatubby, I would like to paint a series  of paintings on our living elders.    There are a lot of photographs of  elders going back to  Indian  Removal   that wasn   t what I wanted. The  living elders.  I started talking to him about it, and he held up his hands and said,     Mike, let   s do it.    That   s the way he is. He makes instant decisions.  And I said,    But Bill, I haven   t told you everything I want to do.     (Laughter)    Let   s do it.    So we set up with Lona Berrick and their  Department of Arts and Humanities, working with them, because I  didn   t know all these people, they did. And working with Glenda  Galvan. They were able to come up with a number of people that we  would interview. Martha would take photographs, and we would do  these interviews about their history. We ended up doing twenty-four  paintings, which I think turned out pretty good. And at the end of that, I  talked to Governor Anoatubby again, and I said,    Governor, this is not  going to do it. I mean, we   ve seen all these people,  we have  all these  interviews, and I   m not going to paint them.    And he said,    Let   s do  twenty-four more.    And so we did forty-eight paintings in all of these  wonderful people.  14  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  So it was the tribe that identified people  for you ?  Yes, like I said, we did not know them, and so we needed a lot of help  from a variety of people, maybe half a dozen or more people, working  with the Arts and Humanities Department. They would gather the names  of these people, and we would go and interview them. Not all of the  people made paintings. Not that they were bad interviews, but for  whatever reason, I just did not feel like I could make a painting here.  That   s one of the things that we concluded early on, that there were two  or three aspects in these paintings that had to happen. The primary one  was, it had to be a good painting. The second one was, my portrayal of  this person had to look exactly like this person. We concluded pretty  quickly that if I were to paint one of these people and it didn   t look like  them, one of their neighbors was going to come and say,    That doesn   t  look like you.    And it would have ruined the project. Fortunately, I   m  able to capture likenesses, and so these paintings all look like who they  are. They   re all wonderful paintings, and like I said, some of the  people   I just couldn   t do anything with some.  That is some of the most realistic work I   ve seen you do. On the other  hand, everything becomes symbolic in a painting. You choose an  attitude, a background, or a posture that conveys the individuality of the  person you   ve painted. Some of the choices, like a woman on the walker,  seem easier than others. I   m wondering how you balanced all of that.  Well, a lot of it came from the interview, but some of the people were  reticent to talk, and reticent to look at me. During these interviews, I  would be sketching, Martha would be taking photographs. She would  take a couple hundred photographs   sometimes more   and out of all  those photographs, maybe one, maybe two, would be what I was after.  But over the years, she has come to be able to see the same things in the  same way that I do. And I see the same things that she   s looking for in  photographs. So it works.  So the hundreds of photographs were of the twenty-four people, you just  took multiple photographs?  Of each person.  To give you some choices     And the way it worked was, we would also have facilitators with us,  somebody that knew this person.  Right.  15  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Glenda Galvan came into play here very heavily, because she knows all  these people, and she speaks Chickasaw. So we would go in, and after  awhile, these people knew why we were there. They were very accepting  from the very start, but having your photograph taken a lot is disturbing,  especially to Indian people, so Glenda would be over here talking to  these people, and I would be over here just sketching away, and have  this person start talking about their past. Again, a difficult thing for  Indian people to do. So what happened was, after a few minutes, Martha  would be taking photographs all around, all over the place. They would  forget she was there. They would talk to me, or they would talk to  Glenda, and start telling their story, get lost in it, and wonderful  photographs come from that.  That is such an amazing body of work. Now were these oil?  Acrylics.  But we   re talking about two months?  Oh no. It took two and half, three years.  For the first set of twenty-four?  No, for all of them. But bear in mind, I   m doing other things, also. I  wasn   t just doing that. Sometimes we would do one a month, sometimes  two a month. Sometimes one every two months. It would depend on  when we were able to get together with these people. Because  sometimes this person would get sick, we wouldn   t be able to go. We  went down to Texas two or three times to gather people. Went all the  way to Washington D.C. to do one, so you can   t do those weekly. Plus,  it kind of wears you out.  How did you feel when the cultural center was opened and the portraits  were unveiled?  Oh,  it  made me cry. You walk into the room, and it was interesting  because the first twenty-four, we never saw them all together for a long  time, we   d see one or two of them at a time. So walking into that room,  and seeing all twenty-four of them there, it was just astounding.  Kind of like an emotional homecoming.  A very emotional homecoming. It was. Some of the people were there.  Several of the people had died in the interim, but that was a wonderful  thing that we were able to portray these people before that. A couple of  people died within a month after we painted their painting, and then, we  16  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  might not have gotten that.  How about the families and the people themselves? What was their  response?  Well the families were   families. We became part of that family, with  each one of those people. And that was gratifying, and heart-warming,  and comforting. Charlie Carter prayed over us.  There   s  an astounding  history of that particular man, but we were all in his house, and he  prayed over us in Chickasaw. Never been prayed over like that. I don   t  know what he said. I know what he said, but I couldn   t understand what  he was saying. And when we had our first showing at the History  Center, all these twenty-four paintings in there, there were family  members, sons and daughters, and all those people    there were  a lot of  people. And one man came over and grabbed me by the arm and said,     Brother, come and let   s take a picture with Momma.    Momma was in  the painting. I   ve never been called brother by somebody who is not my  brother. It   s very, very big. And those people were accepting of us when  they did that, and we still run into these people. After the series had been  done, you know, they walk up and say,    Brother, come.     I   m going to shift a little bit to talking about your philosophies and  practices in art today  like  the larger-than- life hands that you use in  your portraits. What was one of your inspirations for developing that?  That developed when I went to the University of Houston. When I went  down there, I followed this sculpture professor there, because he was  renowned and all that, and I was going to learn a lot. I didn   t. But I went  to Houston because I had planned on making my life as an artist, as a  sculptor. I am down there, studying the way we had to study   he wanted  us to look at history, the history of sculpture. We all studied  Michelangelo, and Rodin, and those two in particular, if you   ll look at  them, they made the hands of their people quite large. The most notable  one would be the Michelangelo sculpture of the young David. His hands  are way too big, and I just loved that, and so we all did that. Here you  have a classroom full of students, all doing sculptures with big hands.  So, when I got into painting more, it just kind of naturally flowed into  the paintings. It also provides, we discovered, a certain visual  dimension, an immediate visual dimension within a painting. It   s like  holding your hand close to a camera. All of a sudden, the hand is bigger  than it should be. Do you see? And it   s that kind of thing, that when you  make a hand a little bit bigger in the canvas, all of a sudden it has a  depth, an immediate depth, and nobody understands why. Well I   m not  going to tell them. I just do it. (Laughter)  And that requires scaling the arms in the painting a little bit differently?  17  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Sometimes. One thing we discovered, especially in this series for the  Chickasaws, and doing these older people. As people get older, they  tend to grow closer to the floor. Some of these people that we painted  were shorter than me, when in their youth, they were taller, so their  spines may contract and they may get a little closer to the ground, but  their arms are the same length. One individual, in particular, that we paid  attention to, she could almost touch her knees with her fingers because  of getting old. But her arms were the same length, and wonderful hands.  If we had shortened her arms to match her height, it would have been  wrong. And sometimes, I use that extra length in arms or hands to sweep  across a canvas, but that   s for a purpose, for guidance or design or  composition. I do it on purpose. I know the dimensions, I know the  measurements, so I   m able, or I can, expand them if I want to.  You   ve done a number of series. Does that allow you to sort of explore a  subject in more detail? What are the advantages?  Well, a lot of times somebody will come and say,    I want a painting on  this particular period of history.    Well, a painting just won   t do it.  There   s too much, and if you try and put too much in a painting, it  becomes so complicated it can become boring, if you   re not careful. You  need a focus in a painting. You can surround it with other stuff, but you  need a focus in a painting. So doing a series gives you an opportunity to  develop an idea that might include many, many different aspects of a  particular group of people. We did a series of paintings, very large  paintings, for the Pottawattomie people up in Michigan. They were eight  paintings. They were eight feet tall and twenty feet long   eight of them.  And it was about Pottawattomie history. Again, what came into play  here was that we were contracted to do this because we paint large  paintings. They have many good Pottawattamie artists, but they don   t  paint large paintings. So they contracted us to do that, and it really suited  me because I was able to get into their history, going back to ancient  history up to present-day powwow. We were able, in these eight  paintings, to go back hundreds of years   maybe thousands   and do  eight paintings of their history, up to present day. I was delighted with  the way it turned out, because it gave me the opportunity to really, really  get into the meat of what those people are about.  What kinds of research did you do for that project?  We were provided with an elder we became very good friends with, and  he was my guide. I had many, many conversations with him, and went  up to Michigan more times than I ever want to go again. (Laughter) I  talked to him about this or that, and he walked me through it. We talked,  like I said, many, many times, about what the paintings might be, what  18  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  was important to them, what their culture was like, how it developed. He  was very knowledgeable, and guided me through it, and I would come  up with all these ideas. We   d talk on the phone, and he said,    Aaanh, I  don   t like that.    So I wouldn   t do it. I had to pretty much rely on him  because every tribe is different, and he was quite good at that. I would  do the studies. I did eight studies, and I took them up to be approved by  their Council, and it was quite a process. Art by committee is always  difficult. I took these paintings up there, and had to please over twenty  people, and that   s difficult. I had to please twenty Indian people, which  is more difficult. So, they came back at me about a thing or two, and  there were two or three other people that didn   t like my paintings, or  didn   t like me, but overall, it worked out. We were able to get it done. It  took a couple of years to do. Very big paintings, and they   re up there  now, and they   ll be there for awhile.  That   s always a process, I think, especially when you   re an artist of one  tribe and depicting that other tribe. Did you go through a similar thing   with your  Quartz Mountain Institute Murals?  As a matter of fact. (Laughs) But these were with Kiowa people, and  Kiowas are beautiful people. I mean, look at the Black Leggings  Society. We were fortunate to deal with some people like Dixon  Palmer   you know the Palmers   wonderful people. But early on, we  ran into some difficulties because again, there were Kiowa artists who  weren   t real happy with me. Not because they knew me, but because I  was not Kiowa. So we had to talk to them, and go through a process, and  get through that. And, as it turned out, they were happy with what I did.  You have to be careful. You have to be very careful. That   s why you  need guides from the tribes   competent elders. I prefer dealing with  elders, quite frankly,  more  than younger artists in a situation like that,  because the elders deal with the overall picture. They   re aware of their  history, and they have no ego to deal with. So, we were happy with the  Kiowa paintings, and they were, too. So it worked out.  It   s wonderful how you started out wanting to be a sculptor, and then  painting became the primary focus of your art, and  now  you   re sort of  coming back around  to doing a lot of sculpture. I   m wondering if your  mural work has better enabled you to take on monumental sculptures?  I think so. The way we try and sculpt is painting and clay. And doing  these large paintings   oversized paintings    is a real benefit, I think.  In  sculpture , you don   t deal in color, but you do deal in contrast, and light  and shadow, and all of these form things that you deal with in painting.   It   s  just a different way of looking at it. But we talk about that  with   sculpture. The brushstrokes in clay, and people look at that and say,     What in the hell are you talking about?    (Laughter) Well, you  19  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  understand because you   ve been in art all these years, what I mean about  brushstrokes in clay.  Sort of that hands-on, immediate contact with the material? What do you  enjoy about the sculpting process?  I think I just covered that. (Laughter) When we look at building a  sculpture piece, like the large piece we did for the hospital in New  Jersey, they wanted us to keep a running daily documentary. So we  documented the thing photographically.  Martha did that.  Martha did that. From the very first day, when I built the armature,  which is just wire, first layers of clay which looked like Don Quixote, no  clay, no nothing, and the development is what I enjoy about working in  sculpture. I love saying that.  Can you describe your creative process for me? From the genesis,  maybe for painting or sculpture.  Describe the creative process?  Yes. (Laughter) In the case of commission work, there   s more of an  external  impetus .  I   ll tell you what, some of my best paintings have come from church.  This has happened before. I   ll  nudge  Martha.    Martha, you got a  pencil?    (Laughter)  When you   re in church?  This is in church, when we   re listening to the sermon, or the homily, or  whatever, and somehow I kind of go away. (Laughter) I   ll just sketch  down an idea really quickly that just kind of washes through my mind,  like that painting of cranes, and do a real quick little sketch, bring it  home, tack it on the wall. It might not become anything for a year, two  years, and then one day, you   re walking by it, and you see what you  saw, that you may have forgotten. It becomes a painting, and then real  quickly, you do a bigger sketch, and you put it on the canvas. Most of  the time it works, sometimes it doesn   t, but it   s difficult to describe.  So rather than writing down a concept, or a title, what you   ve got is a  quick little sketch?  Yeah. And sometimes those sketches are so obscure that I look at them a  20  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  week later, and I just can   t figure out what the hell they are. (Laughter)  So I keep them. They   re still up on the wall. One of these days, you  know, they might become something. Not that the sermons are dull or  anything like that, but they might say something.  One of our best paintings came from a furniture store out in     somewhere   the hardware store. We were walking down the aisle, and  here is this green couch over here, with a red lamp right beside it, and I  saw it just in my periphery. I   m not going to tell you what I said.  (Laughter) But I grabbed something, and I sketched it down, and it  became this guy with a red bandana with a green cloak, flowing across  the painting. It became one of our best paintings. And it was a couch and  a lamp. That   s the creative process, I guess. I cannot explain it. I think  maybe  it   s  being able to recognize something. I don   t know.  We   ve talked about your work with the Chickasaws as being an  emotional homecoming. Do you think of yourself as an artist who  happens to be Indian? Do you think of yourself as an Indian artist?  It   s the first one. I   m an artist. I happen to have an Indian heritage, and it  has blossomed over the years, because of our relationship with all these  people down in Ada. Their history is becoming more and more  important to me all the time. Like I told you earlier, I was kind of a late  bloomer because I did not spend any time with my father, who was  Chickasaw. I had to kind of develop it from a need of my own. And the  need that Martha and I both felt, when we were doing this series, was  fulfilled, because we became part of forty-eight families. Those people  know us, talk to us, and we became a part of their life. We learned things  about them that, in some instances, their families didn   t know about until  they told their story. And we happened to be there when they told it.  That   s a blessing, to be a part of that, becoming so familiar with these  people that you don   t know. It   s wonderful.  To have shared in those histories, and be passing those on. You have  done two books together,    Thing of Who They Are,    and    Proud to be  Chickasaw.    Did you have a book at the back of your mind when you  started the process? How did the idea of a book develop?  Well, doing the paintings was first, working that out with Governor  Anoatubby. And then I got together with Lorna Berrick, and pretty  quickly, after that idea, before the first painting was done, they said,     We   re going to be needing to make a book out of this.     It was like a collective reaction? Everybody   s response?  We had several meetings with those people down there. I   m not real  21  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  fond of meetings. You know, several people around the table, everybody  talking at once, and all you want to do is leave. (Laughter) But some  good ideas came out of it, and the book, and concepts, that   s where that  came from.  I understand you   re in the Chickasaw Hall of Fame.  Yes.  Is it a portrait or is it a photo? I assume it   s not a self portrait.  Yeah, I don   t know how they did those. We have a photograph for me.  (Laughs)  Looking back on your career,  are  there any highlights we might not  have discussed?  I think we pretty much covered everything. I would say that the mural in  the Capitol was the most important thing that happened to us. Could  have been because of the time that it happened. It kind of projected us     gave us a jump start, in a way   to do that very large painting, have it in  the Capitol. We have the best spot in the whole Capitol for that thing to  be hanging.  You walk up the steps, and that   s what you see, so that was wonderful. It  provided us with a good amount of money, which allowed me to do  some things that I wanted to do that I had not done. I think the  recognition we have received because of that has been our greatest  event, art-wise. We have some other things, like the big sculpture in  New Jersey and those paintings for the people up in Michigan, and stuff  like that, bigger projects, but maybe not more important.  It sort of started with that?  And it was in    91, and that was a very pivotal period for us, I think.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about that we haven   t discussed?  No.  We   re going to take a look at some of your artwork here.  Okay. One of the religious paintings, or works of art, that I do, and  Martha modeled for this. This is the    Assumption of Mary    that Martha  has modeled for. She made the clothes. A very good model. Has not  been for sale, never will be. We did this for ourselves.  22  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  Little Thunder  Larsen  That   s tough, to be able to keep paintings for yourself. (Laughter) We   re  going to shift over to Tecumseh.  When we were showing at the Ray Tracey Gallery in Santa Fe, we did a  series of paintings one year on the great Indian leaders of history.  Tecumseh was one of those. This is a portrayal of him.  Martha and I   found this  decorative antique  screen that he is standing in front of, so I  put it behind  Tecumseh  in the painting. So Tecumseh is really in the  painting twice. You can see him, and his brother. The man on horseback,  the face of the man on horseback, is  Andrew  Jackson. I put his face on  there because he was a nasty fellow. It   s interesting because on the   decorative  screen, Jackson was shooting Tecumseh, but it looks like he  is also shooting Tecumseh in the foreground. I don   t know, it was  interesting the way it worked out. That was an accident. I did not intend  that. Maybe I did.  Yeah, I love the picture of Jackson   s face there.  This painting did not sell in that series in Santa Fe, and so we were very  happy to get the painting back.  Yes. Sometimes you actually try to jinx stuff. I know we do. (Laughter)  This is interesting because that is my grandfather that I lived with in  Wynnewood. Sharecropper, old guy, smoked a lot. I can still remember  the way he smelled. He smelled like Vitalis and Camel cigarettes. I sold  this painting back in the mid-seventies      75,    76, something like that     to a lady in Oklahoma City. At the time, I really wanted to keep the  painting but I really needed the money. So I sold it to this woman with  the stipulation   I was kind of kidding, in a way   but I said,    If you die,  I want that painting back.    Well, here about four years ago, she died and  willed me this painting back.  Oh my goodness.  So we got it back and  we   re  very, very happy to have it.  What a wonderful story. Mike, thank you so much for your time during  this interview.  Well, thank you.  -------  -------
