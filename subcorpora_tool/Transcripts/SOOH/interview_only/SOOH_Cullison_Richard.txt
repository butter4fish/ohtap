 Finchum  Cullison  Today is June 13, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library. We   re conducting an Oral History  Project featuring the 1930s. Today we   re in Stillwater, Oklahoma  talking with Richard Cullison. Thank you for coming today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start with having you tell a little bit about your childhood, where  you were born, and then we   ll work our way forward.  Alright. I was born on a cotton farm north of Chandler, Oklahoma in  1921, October 1. When I was about three years old we moved to  Cushing, in the oil field. We lived there about three years and then we  moved to Shidler, Oklahoma in Osage County, in the oil fields. I went to  school up there and graduated from high school in 1939 and I went in  the Navy.  Where did you graduate from?  Webb City High School.  How did your parents come to Oklahoma?  Well my great-grandfather and my grandfather both made the Run in     89. My father was born in Shawnee in 1900. And on my mother   s side,  my great-grandfather and my grandfather moved to Oklahoma around  1900 from Ohio. My mother was born in Ohio. She was about two years  old when they moved.  What did they do for a living? Farm?  Farmers, yes. And my father worked in the oil field, but the rest of his  5  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  family were farmers.  So in the    30s you would have lived in     I lived in the oil fields in Osage County between Webb City and Shidler.  When we moved up there in 1925, it was a boom town. There were three  towns up there and they were all booming. (Laughs) The little town of  Denoya was known as Wizbang.  I haven   t heard of that.  Yeah, for years and years, and still the people up there call it Wizbang,  but it   s gone. It   s a ghost town. They were very wild. We lived in Webb  City and it was pretty wild in that town, too.  Is it still there?  Yes, it   s still there. There   s no commercial interest there but it   s got  probably 30 people that live there in the town site.  So when you were young what kinds of things were there? Did you have  a grocery store?  Yes they had probably 20,000 people living there.  Oh, so they probably had everything.  They had everything   dance halls and saloons and grocery stores and  movie houses and barber shops. Everything you can think of, they even  had two newspapers printing there. It was pretty wild at the time.  About how long did that last?  It lasted until about 1929 when the banks went broke and then  everything began to quiet down.  Did your parents stay there?  They stayed there, yes. My dad worked for Phillips Petroleum. He  stayed there. He later transferred to Edmond, later in life.  So when you graduated from high school, what did you do?  I went in the Navy. I signed up for six  years . I was in Pearl Harbor  when they bombed it. From the time they bombed it they put me on  another ship and we went down to the South Pacific and I was down  6  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  there during the entire war.  I have to say thank you for that.  You   re welcome. (Laughter)  And once you got out of the Navy?  When I got out I learned trade as a diesel mechanic and I worked as a  diesel mechanic for the oil field companies until about 1960. Then I  done what I had wanted to do all my life, I went to a racetrack and  trained race horses for about 40 years.  That   s interesting.  We retired off the racetrack.  How many horses did you have then?  Oh, we had generally from ten to 30 at any given time.  So you had to have a farm for those?  No, I just trained at the racetrack. Different people brought horses to me  and I trained for other people. We did a lot of traveling. We went to  Florida and Ohio and Louisiana and California, but mainly we trained in  New Mexico and Colorado because we liked that country.  What brought you back to Oklahoma?  The roots I guess. (Laughter) I had a job after I quit training. I had a job  in Texas and I got offered a job in Oklahoma and so we moved back to  Oklahoma and we had a little farm around here and a little ranch.  Raising horses?  Well, I had a racetrack on it and barns and I trained on there for awhile,  but not like we done when we were running so many. We were busy and  moving all the time and everything.  Well when you were growing up in Webb City, did you have any  brothers and sisters?  I had one brother and two sisters, yes. My brother was about a year and a  half older than me and my sisters were younger. And, oh, it was quite a  place when we moved up there. There was a big dance hall right in back  7  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  of our house. We lived in a little shacky house and about a hundred  yards behind us there was a big dance hall that went all night long every  night.  Some lessons for youngsters, I guess.  Yes, shootin    guns and guys hollering and it was just a wild country. But  they had that throughout Oklahoma, Seminole and Three Sands and  Drumright and Cushing was kind of a boom town. Anywhere they had  an oil field, they had a boom.  Then when the Depression hit, how did it effect the town?  The town started drying up during the Depression, yeah. A few men  worked for major oil companies and they didn   t fire people then when  they got in the Depression, they prorated them. Like my wife   s dad, he   d  work maybe one week and then he   d be off a week and then maybe  they   d send him to Tonkawa or Three Sands and he   d be off a week, that  way they kept everybody making a little bit of money. I don   t think  companies do that anymore.  They don   t seem to.  My dad worked for Phillips and they were real good, one of the finest  companies. He worked for the company but didn   t make much money. I  think he got a hundred dollars a month. That   s not much when raising  four kids.  Did your mother work?  She worked off and on at different jobs. She worked in a grocery store  awhile. I really don   t remember much of what she   s done.  Well if they lived in town then they didn   t have a garden?  Well nobody lived in town hardly. You lived out in a company camp.  A company camp?  Yeah. Some places they would have a little line of houses along the  road, which you would call a rag row. We lived in two of them. Just  little shotgun houses. Carry your water, outdoor toilet.  And the company built them?  No, those were privately owned. But they did build housing at the  8  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  company camps and we lived in three different ones of them.  Same situation with outdoor plumbing?  No, they were nice. They were good houses. I think my dad paid, if I  remember right, he paid 15 dollars a month in rent and they furnished  the utilities.  And he made a hundred dollars?  Made a hundred dollars a month. By the time you bought clothes for  four kids and sent them to school and bought groceries, you didn   t have  anything left.  But you all turned out pretty good?  Pretty good. I would have liked to have gone to college, but there wasn   t  no way for me to go. So I joined the Navy and my brother joined the  Navy.  Did you have the G.I. bill when you got out?  Yes. I went two years and I quit. We had one child and another on the  way.  Had to go to work.  (Laughs) Yeah.  Well, did your mother do much canning?  Yes. She canned a lot of stuff.  Did you have a cellar where she kept it?  At times we did, depends on where we lived. But we always had a big  garden. And we all worked in it.  Did she make all your clothes?  Yes, she did quite a bit. She made all my shirts. I don   t think she made  pants for me, but the two girls, she made all their clothes.  What sort of things did you do for fun as a child?  I hunted and fished and played ball. I don   t know, it seemed like my  9  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  childhood was full, you know. It wasn   t boring or anything. I was kind  of more or less a lone ranger. I would get my dog and trek out across  them prairies up there.  Just hunting or just going?  Well both. I had a place to fish up there, I fished a lot. I still enjoy  fishing.  Catch and release?  No, I don   t catch very much, so I have to keep them. (Laughter)  Well what sort of work did your grandparents do then?  Were they   farmers?  My father   s parents lived on a farm in Wellston, right at the edge of the  city limits. They moved a lot. After they came up to Oklahoma on the  Run they lived at Crescent and they lived at Stillwater and they lived at  Cushing. They lived at Shawnee and Prague and wound up at Wellston  and farmed there on the edge of town. They both died right there.  What did they raise?  They raised cotton. And my mother   s folks, when they lived in Ohio  they had real nice farms up there and they come to Oklahoma with quite  a bit of money and bought a lot of land in Western Oklahoma because it  was cheap. It was cheap but it wasn   t any good. So my grandpa, he  wound up in El Reno and he worked on Rock Island Railroad and later  on in life he was a mattress salesman. And they both died in El Reno.  Did you have to help pick cotton some?  No. My mother did. She used to lay me on a sack at the end of the row  and she   d pick down and pick back. Then she   d move me up a row and  do the same thing. It was hard work picking cotton. I was a baby then.  And when we moved off that farm I was probably two years old. My  sister was born in Cushing and I am two and a half years older than her.  I was about two years old.  Probably born at home?  Yeah, all of us kids were born at home. I have quite a few memories and  I wrote them down in that story I brought with me. In the summertime  when I wasn   t in school and was working in the harvest in Western  Oklahoma around Alva, we got a dollar a day for that.  10  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Harvesting?  Yeah, shocking wheat. They didn   t have combines much then. They just  started getting combines. But they shocked them with shocks and   would  take it to a thrashing machine later on in the fall. I   d work out  there in the summers and run around a lot of different places and one  time I went on a freight train to California and hitchhiked back.  Couldn   t do that today, could you?  No, can   t do that today. Those were pretty hard times when the freight  train would be loaded down with men and they didn   t know where they  was going. Two are going that way and two are going this way on  another train and when they   d get somewhere, they   d turn around and go  back.  And you just went to go?  Yeah, I was just having fun. I had a friend that went with me in high  school. I think I was about 15 and he was about 16.  You weren   t nervous?  No. I   d run around like that all my life from the time I was 12, you  know, in the summers.  You parents didn   t worry?  No, they didn   t worry. Good riddance, they thought. (Laughter) It   s a  different world nowadays. You can   t do that nowadays. It wasn   t any  danger, really.  I can   t imagine riding in a train car that far though with other people  you didn   t even know.  Oh yeah. They were just desperate men looking for something to do, a  job. Some of them would find a job some place and quit roaming around  for awhile, but when you can   t work and you can   t eat, you   re going to  do something else.  Keep moving, I guess.  I remember a hobo jungle in Grand Junction, Colorado. The railroad run  over a river and then about in the middle of the river, there was an  island. You walk out on the railroad and drop down on the island and it  was a hobo jungle. Nobody bothered it. The police didn   t go in there or  11  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  anything. Everybody looked out for each other and it was a safe place to  be. There were days when they would span out over town and get  whatever they could to bring back and have a great big pot of stew  everybody ate. That   s the way they lived.  And did you do that?  Yeah. I was the main gatherer. I   d ask a woman for something to eat and  she   d take me into the house and feed me and then load me down with  groceries. Cause I was a pretty innocent little kid.  Sure, at 15 or 16 you would be. How long did you do that?  Just that one summer. We were gone about two months, I guess.  I wonder if the island is still there?  Yeah it still is. I don   t know if it   s a hobo jungle or not.  Well the train may not cross it anymore.  May not, yeah. But there was experiences that hardly anyone my age got  to do. I guess it was in my genes or something. (Laughter)  Cowboy one way or the other.  Yeah.  We haven   t heard any hobo stories so I   m glad you   re sharing those.  Well I wrote all that down. My sisters had insisted that I do that. They  wanted me to write about later life in the Navy and afterwards but I  haven   t done that. I was in Pearl Harbor when they bombed it and  everything and they wanted me to write about that. I don   t hardly ever  talk about it.  Do you want to share any of that on the tape?  No.  What ship were you on?  A small ship in the harbor. I was stationed at the Navy yard. We went  out to the USS Arizona when it blew up and fought fire up there for a  couple of days, picked up dead bodies.  12  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Things you   d just as soon not relive, isn   t it?  Yeah.  So after the Navy, you came back and you got married?  Yeah. I didn   t know my wife. She lived right there in that field. She was  five years younger than me. But I got to know her as soon as I got home  and within two months we were married.  Love at first sight then?  Yeah. 63 years now.  How many children?  Two.  And how many grandkids?  I got one granddaughter at home. She   s just finishing her PhD in  chemistry at Missoula, Montana.  Are any of them interested in horses?  No. Of course the boy when he was growing up he got enough with  cleaning the stalls. He worked with me at the race track. But he was a  veterinarian. He got his degree as a veterinarian.  So still animals, just a little different direction.  Well, what he done, he went back to school and got a master   s in  toxicology and then he went to work for the government in Washington  D.C. with the Food and Drug Administration. He   s retired now. He   s  been back in New Mexico.  So you have to hop the train and go see him.  (Laughs) Yeah, we   ve been out there a couple times. I can   t drive  anymore cause of my eyesight. My wife, she   s a good driver, but she  can   t drive very far. But he comes back and sees us pretty often.  Well on your wife   s side of the family, how did they deal with the  Depression era, do you know?  They lived in a little house out in the country that they own. Her dad  13  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  worked for Sinclair Oil Company and they would ship him around to  different places and work a week and back home a week. I guess they  done that until about the time the war started. It started getting a little  better by then I guess. And her father was pretty thrifty. He saved his  money good. Of course, there wasn   t much money to be saved then.  A penny meant something during those days.  Yeah. We still go back to Shidler every once in a while for a reunion,  but there   s never anybody there from my class. I think we   re going to go  back this year and that   ll probably be the last time. It   d be my 70th.  70th high school reunion.  Yeah. They have pretty good attendance at the reunions up there     younger kids.  63 years of marriage is pretty good, too.  Yeah it is. Good marriage, too.  So living through the Depression wasn   t too bad then.  We didn   t even know it was a Depression.  Everybody else was there with you right?  Nobody had any money   Can you see some parallels to today with what Obama   s trying to do?  Well, I   ll tell you where it could get bad. I was pretty young but I knew  that when the banks failed, the government did nothing. They sat on  their hands and let people go down. By the time Roosevelt got elected,  then we were in a bad depression. And things started that way under  George Bush and it didn   t need to get as bad as it did   he did nothing  just like Hoover did. I   m a Republican, been a Republican all my life,  but I don   t vote republican anymore. I really appreciate Obama.  Do you remember any of the WPA projects? Were people working for  that in your area?  Yeah, there were some. Mostly, up there was all oil field related and  there wasn   t much   like the little old town didn   t amount to anything. In  Cushing, they built that library by the WPA. A nice library. We didn   t  have any of that up there, but they did have some kind of jobs going on  14  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  the roads or something, you know. People that didn   t work for an oil  company were in hard shape.  Well someone has said that they built the outside toilets, that the WPA  went around the country and did some of those types of things.  Yeah they did. They did all kinds of stuff.  I hadn   t heard about the toilets. I knew they did libraries, but I wasn   t  sure about the other things.  And then they had a work program   I   m trying to think of what they  called that   for young people and some kids from our school did that.  There was an NYA   National Youth     No. They   d go up in the mountains in Colorado and build forest trails.  Kind of like the CCC?  Yeah, that   s what it was. And Obama is trying to get something like that  going now, which is a great thing. I think these young people can get  into that and get off of drugs.  Put in a hard day   s work.  We didn   t know what drugs was when I was a kid, you know.  Just soda pop.  (Laughter) And bootleg whiskey.  There you go.  Whiskey was illegal then, but they had bootleggers. But there wasn   t any  hard drugs.  Not even on the hobo train?  Well one time. I rode on there and was riding in the flat car. We went  through the mountains and there was a group of Spanish guys at one end  of the flat car and white guys at the other end and they were smoking  marijuana, I guess. And one of them got to staggering around and fell off  the car  Wasn   t going very fast, going up through the mountains was  pretty slow. But he didn   t get up, they just looked over the side and I   m  sure he was alright. But that   s the only time of my life I remember being  15  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  around drugs even. I   ve never tasted any kind of illegal drug or  anything. And my kids are the same way. They grew up knowing better  than to do that. I told my boy when he was in high school, it was in  Raton, New Mexico and there were a lot of Spanish boys out there and I  think they were smoking marijuana some and everything and I told him  if he went to jail with drugs, I would just leave him. I wouldn   t get him  out. As far as I know, he never touched it.  Well growing up when your mother would cook home cooked meals,  what was your favorite?  Just like it is right now, beans and fried potatoes and cornbread.  Sounds good to me. Did you have chores yourself around the house?  Yeah, we kept two or three cows all the time back down in the pasture  and we had a barn down there so we could have our own milk and  butter, and kept some chicken down there. I had a little milk route that I  would run before school in the morning. But that   s about all I had  around the house. I mowed lawns, I had an old push reel mower.  Nobody had a gasoline mower. Didn   t know what they was then. Had  big lawns in them company camps and we got a quarter for mowing  them. They wouldn   t let us mow it until it got back knee high and then  we had to go and cut it and rake it and mow it, wound up you working  four or five days and you   d make a quarter. (Laughs)  About how many houses would be in a company camp?  One of them we lived in was about eight houses and the other two were  about 22 or 23, something like that.  When the oil companies left the area, did they move the houses or they  just left them?  Some of them they sold to people and then left them right there. The one  I was raised up in is still sitting right there. The gasoline plant is gone  and nearly all the houses, there are about five or six left in that camp,  they   re kind of scattered out. People bought them and already had the  utilities and everything to them. I   m sure they didn   t pay hardly anything  for them. But it was a neat place to live.  And that would be in Webb City?  You know where Webb City is?  It   s up north from here, isn   t it?  16  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Yeah. But Shidler is on Highway 18. Webb City is about three  miles   northwest of Shidler. And both of them are about 12 miles from the  Kansas line. But at one time there was just houses everywhere and not in  the towns, but all over the prairies. Some people would be living in tents  and some of them would be living in wagons. And some of them would  build those little old shotgun houses that   s just two rooms, you know.  Mostly working in the oil field?  That   s the only thing you do up there to make money is work in the oil  field. They don   t have no farming, it   s all grass country up there.  Were there ever any women that worked in oil?  They worked in the offices.  Not outside?  No.  I didn   t know if there were any wildcatters, as they called them.  (Laughs) No. Women didn   t work out like that like they do now.  They   re firemen and policemen and everything else now. But they didn   t  used to do that. They worked in telephone offices or something like that  or grocery stores.  Took care of the children and kept the clothes clean.  Right.  If you lived in a company town, you didn   t have to worry about  electricity or it was already there.  Phillips had their own generating station. They had their own lake. They  furnished water all over that field. They had their own gas pipe and their  own telephone system. One oil company had all that and they furnished  it. Shidler and Webb City and everybody that lived in that area   I think  in the    50s, we lived in a little house in Webb City and we paid two  dollars a month for gas. I   m not sure about the electricity. They  furnished the electricity too. But I didn   t even work for them, I lived in  town. But they had a lot of picnics and when they   d have picnics, they   d  be for everybody, not just employees.  The whole town could come?  17  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  They used to like to have them in Kaw City (it   s under water now where  Kaw Lake is). They had a nice park up there and a swimming pool and  they   d dig a deep pit and put about six whole steers on them spits and  rotate them on those coals. They   d have a thousand people come here  from every direction.  And that   s not there anymore?  No.  What else did they cover up with the lake? Was there another town or  just that one?  Washunga, the little Indian town north of Kaw City, it   s under water.  Just them two, I think.  Were they decent sized towns?  Kaw City was. Washunga was a really small town. Kaw City had a lot of  nice big homes.  Did they move them before they flooded them?  Yeah. Some of them moved clear to Ponca City. And they made what  they call New Kaw City about five miles west on higher ground. They  moved a lot of houses up there and it   s still a town now. But the old Kaw  City, they had a big hotel called the Clubb Hotel. It had one of the most  expensive art collections in the world in it. It belonged to Laura A.  Clubb and she gave it to Gilcrease and  Philbrook .  Well you wonder how she had them in Kaw City.  Well she married this oil man and they built this hotel. They had two  kids. They had a daughter my age and a son about two years younger.  The daughter, she used to get a new convertible every year. And the last  year I was there she had a brand new Packard convertible. They had  plenty of money. But I guess the lady was, I don   t think she was an  artist, she was a patron of the arts and she collected stuff from all over  the world. But high schools all over Oklahoma, they   d run their kids up  there and go see that hotel. The paintings were just on the walls in the  hallways and all through there. If you wanted to steal them, you could  have, I guess.  That would have been in the    40s?  The    30s.  18  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  The Depression didn   t hit them too hard then I guess.  It didn   t seem to particularly bother that one family. After they built that  lake, they left the hotel and you could see it under water. I think they  decided it was a hazard so they finally went in there and brought it up,  got it all out of there. But you could see the hotel across the bridge, you  could look down there in the water and see it down there. It   s not there  anymore though.  Did you fish much in there?  I used to. I used to have a boat and I   d go up there and fish. It   s a nice  lake, I enjoyed it. I can   t drive anymore and my wife doesn   t like to fish  and we   re getting too old for it anyway. We went back up there last  week at the Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, have you heard of it?  I have, but I   ve not been there.  You have got to go up there. They   ve got about 3,000 buffalo up there  and it   s a beautiful country. That   s the first time I   ve been there since  they built that preserve. I used to go when it was the Chapman-Barnard  Ranch, I   d been up there for different reasons. They tore the ranch house  down and they still had the bunk house. It   s a modern brick deal they  built up there. But some pretty wealthy people have owned ranches up  there.  You   ve seen quite a few changes in that area of Oklahoma.  Yeah, of course Webb City actually doesn   t exist except for a few  houses, you know. And Shidler is getting that way. They still have a nice  school in all the towns around there, in Burbank, Reno, Four Acre and  Kaw City, they all went to Shidler school. They have a high school up  there and after I left there they built a new gymnasium. And then a few  years later they built  an auditorium , and then a few years after that they  built another new gymnasium back behind and it   s really nice. They   ve  got a nice school up there. But it just keeps going down a little bit every  year.  They must have to bus kids in from quite a ways.  Yeah, they bus them a long ways out there. And the country   s not  populated densely. Big ranches and that   s about all it is.  If your father worked in the oil fields, did he ever take you on the job so  you could see what he did?  19  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Well I was always with him in the oil fields. I knew what everybody  done.  You just didn   t want to do that yourself?  Not particularly, no. I did work in the oil field though for awhile.  Seems like it   d be dirty.  It is. If you work on them drilling rigs, you   re covered from head to foot  within 30 minutes after you get there. It   s a pretty dirty job.  How would you clean up?  I   d just wash up with Tide soap and change clothes. You leave your  work clothes out on the rigs.  Kind of like an overall?  Yeah. But I knew everybody in that country. I was a kid that just went  every place and done everything. Everybody that worked up there, the  men in the oil fields, they knew me. I   d go out and catch a couple rabbits  and give them a rabbit or two and take a couple home. They called me  the rabbit twister. That stuck with me until I left there.  Did that have something to do with the way you caught them?  Yeah, it did. I had a hound dog. A pipe laid everywhere up in that field.  It   d bend, you know. They   d finish building and it   s natural for rabbits  to get into pipes. But the old dog would stand out at one end and I   d take  a piece of barb wire and go and bend it and twist it around and a rabbit  would usually run out and the dog would get it or he   d get twisted in that  barb wire and I   d pull him out the other end. I caught hundreds and  hundreds of rabbits like that.  Jack rabbits or just regular rabbits?  Cotton tails. There was a lot of jack rabbits, but they weren   t fit to eat. I  did do some hoboing and I wasn   t afraid to ride trains anywhere I went.  If I had to go western Oklahoma to work the harvest, I   d catch a train  going that direction.  Just hop on it or actually have a ticket?  There were no tickets if you were on a freight train. (Laughter) And they  had a little train there where we lived at 12 miles a track. It went up to  20  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Foraker. They   d load them tank cars with gasoline and my dad, that   s  what he done, he worked on the load rack. Then everyday they   d make a  trip up to Foraker and set them off on a siding around Midland Valley  Railroad and pick them up and take them to a refinery and then come  back. It was just 12 miles. I had a good friend in Brakeman, an engineer,  and I could ride anywhere I wanted. They   d take me sometimes half way  to Foraker and let me off at a creek and I   d fish, then they   d pick me up  and I   d come back. Sometimes I   d stay two or three days up there and  then they   d pick me up.  Care free days.  Yep.  You could survive on your own pretty well?  Oh yeah, I could. I could do better than a grown man. I   d charm them  old women a little bit and they   d feed me. (Laughter) And they were  glad to do it.  Did you learn to play the harmonica then?  I learned before that. I played that all my life. I still play every Thursday  night in Cushing.  Really. You   d put it in your pocket and go?  Yep. I   ve got several of them in different keys. I taught myself to play  the fiddle and the guitar and the mandolin.  The banjo?  I tried that and then I gave it up. (Laughter) I thought I could just pick it  up and go to playing it.  Is it harder than the other ones?  To me it was. If I took some lessons on it, they   d start me out right, I  probably would have liked it. But I put it back on eBay and sold it.  (Laughs) On eBay?  That   s where I bought it. I used to buy fiddles on eBay if they   d be  broken down or something. I   d repair them and re-varnish them and put  them back on eBay and resell them. In a ten year period, I probably  repaired 300 or so.  21  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  That   s good.  I liked it. I like to work on fiddles because they were light and pretty  when you got through with them.  How did you get into that?  I don   t really know. I bought a violin and took a couple lessons and quit  playing it and just kind of, oh you get to watching them on eBay and you  like one and you buy it and the first thing I knew I was doing repair  work for everybody around over there, on fiddles. I   d make a little  money trading them so I just kept buying them, fixing them and reselling  them, you know.  Who got you into eBay?  I did.  You did yourself?  My wife bought a computer and she   s good on the computer. You hear  about eBay and you look over there and you find out you can find  anything you want on there.  Pretty much, yes. I looked for banjos for awhile and I was looking for a  five string. My dad gave me one and I don   t know how to play. I was just  looking and it took me all different places.  The last one I bought was a five string. I made a mistake. I should have  bought a tenor banjo so I could just chord it, you know.  I probably would do better with that, too.  I bet you could play it. You need to take a couple of lessons to start you  out right.  Well your fingers have to get tough too, don   t they?  Oh yeah. I play guitar all the time. I   ve got calluses there all the time.  That would be my first trick. I want to do it before I turn 60.  Well I was 75 when I started playing the fiddle.  Well then there   s hope for me yet   22  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  I was probably three when I started playing harmonica. (Laughs)  Did your parents or your grandparents play anything like that?  No, they didn   t play nothing. My great-grandpa was a fiddler though.  And my grandpa didn   t play nothing. My dad didn   t play nothing. My  mother didn   t play anything.  Did they listen to the radio back then?  Oh yeah. I used to listen to it every day at noon if I was home. I   d catch  Bob Wills, every broadcast.  Did they listen to Roosevelt   s fireside chats?  My parents weren   t much into politicians. They didn   t care anything  about it. But they used to listen to those programs, Fibber McGee and     The Shadow?  Some people did, but our family liked those little comedies. I can   t think  of the guy now on those shows, but there was a bunch of them. Didn   t  have no television. First television I had I think was in    51.  Black and white, I   m sure.  Yeah, a real tiny thing; Philco. (Laughter) But it was a good one. It  lasted a long time.  Do you remember going to see Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz  when they first came out?  I wasn   t much into movies. If I went, I   d go on a Saturday night and it   d  be a western. And that   s still the only thing I watch is westerns. Don   t  have many of them on anymore.  Not too many. What kind of car was your first car?  I   m going to tell you about my car. A bunch of boys I   d run around with  from about 7th grade on, didn   t none of us own a car, we all owned one.  We   d buy one for seven or eight dollars   it always had to be a sedan     and we   d take the axe and cut the top off. And then whoever wanted to  drive it and if he wanted to drive it, he   d have to go to someone   s house  and get it and drive it and then he   d keep it at his house or we   d all be  going together or something, you know. We   d drive it right in the  ground and then we   d get another. Never got a license, never worried  23  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  about a title, didn   t have no highway patrol. I think that started in    36 or     37, the highway patrol.  How fast would you go?  If my brother would drive, as fast as it   d go. (Laughter)  And why would you cut the top off?  Because we wanted fresh air like a convertible. (Laughter) You didn   t  have to open the door again. Just jump over it.  And if it rained?  Oh it didn   t bother us.  And in the winter time?  In the winter time, we had a regular deal we went to when it snowed. It  seemed like it snowed a lot up there, heavier snows. But we   d hook  about four or five sleds on the back of the car and one guy would drive  and the rest of them would ride on sleds. And we   d just go up and down  the country roads as fast as them things would go. If you got thrown off,  you would just be off in the snow.  No one ever got hurt?  No, never got hurt very bad.  Would the girls ride on the sleds?  No, they didn   t like sleds.  They knew better, huh?  They   d ride in the car. We don   t ever have enough snow around here to  do that I don   t think.  Doesn   t seem to, do we? Just the ice.  Every year we   d get about three or four snows about a foot deep. I don   t  think they get that up there anymore like that. We had a snow one time,  we lived in a little old shotgun house, and in 1929 it was a blizzard for  about four or five days. Me and my brother was out, we went hunting  with a neighbor kid that was over and we got caught up in that blizzard.  And they had every quarter section up there, they had boiler houses and  24  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  it would heat that steam, heat the oil, get the water out of it, separate it  from the water and that was the way we survived that blizzard. We   d go  from one boiler house to another. Warm up and take another half mile of  going. We got in about nine o   clock that night and boy. They were  frantic. They didn   t even know which way we   d left. But that blizzard,  we had a snow alongside our house and it was even at the top of the  house and it tapered off like that. And we dug tunnels in that snow and  played in it until probably April. They called it the Great Blizzard of    29.  Have you ever read about it?  No. I   ll have to, though.  I   ll bet you could find a story about it.  I   ll look. I sure will.  Other than that I don   t recall any bad weather except snows.  Tornadoes didn   t hit up there?  Oh yeah. Webb City got blown away. It blew away one time while we  was living in that town and twice after, I remember. And ever since,  there   s never been a town there. We was in our backyard watching that  storm start and it was back in the prairie west of us and the tornado  dipped down and then it picked back up and then it went south a little  ways and then it dipped again and Dad said,    That   s right where the  action is. We better go over there.    My brother and I went over there to  see if we could help people out and when it dipped down at the start it  was right in a herd of cattle and it picked those cattle up and carried  them about four or five miles down in that little town and when it dipped  down it just strung cattle everywhere. They were all dead. It wiped that  town out. There never was a town after that.  Maybe I can find something in the old newspapers about that, too.  In the Shidler Review, they still put stuff up in that paper about that  tornado. (Laughter) The first place we stopped, the house was kind of  shook apart but it was still a house and there was a woman in it and my  dad said,    Can we help you do anything?    She said,    If you will, put that  kitchen table back in the kitchen.    It was in the front room. She said,     It   s supposed to be in the kitchen.    She had a big kitchen.    Okay, we   ll  move it back there for you.    So we got a hold of that thing, one of them  big round oak tables and there was no way we could get it through that  door to put it back in the kitchen. And we went to looking and the roof  had lifted and turned just a little bit and set back down and it must have  lifted that table out and put it down in the front room. There was no way  25  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  we could fit it. We had to take it out the front door and come around  through the back and put it in the kitchen. But the whole roof was just  sitting there cock eyed. It was loose. It was about the only house left in  town. It got the schools and everything there. It was a big tornado.  I haven   t seen one. I don   t really care to.  I   ve seen a lot of them   On the news is good enough.  When we lived in Webb City, we had a tornado. We had a little old tiny  shotgun house, we had cables running over the side of it. They didn   t put  peaks up over it, they just put a round top on it. Had the cables running  over that and down in the barrels full of rocks to keep from blowing  away. We had a little old cellar, we went in the cellar. The next storm  would pass and we   d come back out and our house was still there and  our neighbor   s house was sitting right next to it and all four walls were  laid out just like that and the people were still in bed. They didn   t get up  and go to the cellar or nothing and the roof was gone. Never did find the  roof. How it got blown away, I don   t know. It didn   t blow the walls  away, it just let them lay down. But it took that roof somewhere.  No telling where.  They   re funny   they   re not funny, they   re terrible things, but they can  do some things that you can   t hardly believe.  How did you meet your wife?  When she got out of high school she went to Tulsa   s Business Institute  and took a course and then she   d come home and she was working in the  office there for Phillips. I come in from the Navy, I got discharged and  had to come home and my dad kept telling me,    Go down there and see  that little blonde.    He said,    She   s pretty.    (Laughter) So I went down  there one day and she was pretty. I made a date with her that night and  two months later we were married.  Where did you go on your honeymoon?  I went to see my aunt down in Brady, Texas.  (Laughter) That   s quite a ways.  Yeah, I hadn   t seen her in many years. Oh we went probably two weeks  messing around. I had a little money I got lucky in a poker game coming  26  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  back to the states after being discharged. I wasn   t worried about going to  work for a little while. (Laughter)  Where did you take her on your first date?  I took her to Fairfax.  What was in Fairfax?  A movie. And it was pretty cold. It was in December or January. It  started sleeting on the way home and the windshield wiper didn   t work.  And I remember I rolled that window down and sat there and worked  that wiper enough to see where we was going and get my hand inside  through and we made it home. I wouldn   t have ever thought about it  except that was the first date I ever went with her.  63 years. That would have been in        45. December of    45.  Do you remember the movie?  No.  Western?  No, I don   t remember. I   m not sure we went to a movie. But we went  somewhere down there.  In Fairfax?  Yeah. There wasn   t much to do in there in that country anyway. In the  summertime, they used to have a lot of ballgames. Every oil company  has a softball team. They had baseball teams for awhile in the early    30s  and then they started playing softball. My brother and I both played on  the Phillips team. My dad did too.  Did they actually have little stadiums or they played in high school   ?  They had nice ball parks for playing softball. The oil companies built  them. They did a good job. They built good parks.  What position did you play?  I played second base. It died out during the war. I don   t guess they do  anything up there anymore. They don   t have gasoline or tires.  27  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Or men.  Yeah. I missed that part of it while I was gone, but I guess they had a  pretty tough time   didn   t have no sugar, no gasoline, no tires. I don   t  know what else. We didn   t have any problems. We had all the stuff.  All you needed.  Yeah.  Well they had some POW camps here in Oklahoma too during that time.  Yeah they had one at Tonkawa. It was a pretty nice camp. I don   t know,  but they said that they used to take people into their homes sometimes  for a meal or something   German prisoners. I didn   t know anything  about them. I wasn   t here then.  Where did you ship out of?  I joined the Navy in Tulsa and they sent me to San Diego for boot camp.  And then when you got out?  I got out at Long Beach, California and took a train across the country. I  love them trains. I thought they were the best transportation you can get.  Well there were quite a few in Oklahoma for awhile back in the    20s and     30s.  Yeah, some of them went out of business and some of them were bought  by other railroads. My grandpa worked for Rock Island in El Reno and  the Union closed that down after the war. They went on strike and  wouldn   t go back and they just shut it down. Everybody was out of a job  then.  What did your grandfather have to do?  That   s when he started selling mattresses. He was quite a character. He   d  go around them boarding houses and things and show them to those old  ladies and then he   d go to Chickasaw and make them and bring them  back on his little truck and put them on his back and go up the stairs  with them. (Laughter).  So he sold them before he made them?  Yeah.  28  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  He had to make them himself?  Yeah. At the mattress factory down in Chickasaw he made his own  mattresses and sold them, delivered them and everything.  Probably because cotton was grown in the area? Were they cotton  mattresses?  They were cotton, but I don   t know where they bought it. The mattress  factory would buy the cotton and it   d come in a big batch. At that time,  there wasn   t hardly any air spring mattresses. They were just mattresses.  Had to beat them with a broom to re-shift the cotton.  Yeah. (Laughter)  He   d have to give the company a commission, I guess.  Yeah he paid for the material and I guess for using the machinery and  whatever. But he made his own mattresses. He didn   t want anybody else  to make them.  And he did that pretty well until he retired?  Yeah, yeah. Oh he probably done that until he was 80. He died when he  was 96.  Oh gosh. I hope he didn   t carry them up the stairs by himself until he  was 80.  Yeah he was because I helped him some. I   d go by and see him and he   d  have some to deliver and I   d go with him. I liked him real well. He was  a nice old man   wasn   t very big, but boy he was a hustler and a talker.  He went to the barber shop one time and got in a fight with another old  man and Grandpa was about probably 75 and the other old man was  probably 75 or 80 and I asked him about that fight and he said,    Yeah I  whipped that old man.    He said,    I could have whipped him if he   d been  100.    (Laughter)  That   s why he lived to be 96. He still had the spirit.  Yeah, he did until the day he died. He got almost blind and couldn   t see.  I think he just had   what do you have over your lens? When your lens  gets clouded up, you go to the doctor and they put a new lens in, what do  they call that?  29  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  If you hadn   t asked me, I could tell you because my aunt had both hers  done too.  (Laughs) I did too. Both mine.  Cataracts.  I think that   s what he had because his eyes were blue, cloudy. That   s the  last time I went to see him and he was probably 95 and he came up that  close to me and then he recognized me. His father, my great-grandfather,  he was the one that had all the farms in Ohio he sold. He went and  bought all that land up around north of Woodward, Fort Supply and it  wasn   t any good so he wound up at Calumet. And he still had money, he  owned a movie house   they called it the Opera House   and a lot of  buildings in that town and when he died, he was still pretty wealthy.  An opera house in El Reno?  No it was in, not Calumet, it   s between Watonga and Calumet. What   s  that town south of Watonga? Geary, that   s where he wound up living  and he died there.  I know there weren   t that many opera houses around so I was just  curious.  No, no. I don   t think.  Stillwater had one for awhile, but I don   t know how many across the  state there were.  When I first joined the Navy, they had those burlesque houses out there  in San Diego and they were clean, but they were risqu   and had a lot of  comedians and dancers and singers. Anybody that wanted to be in  burlesque, they could go out there and get in it. And I used to go over  there quite a bit. I enjoyed them.  You   d seen some of those in your own home town, hadn   t you? The  saloon behind your house?  Yeah, I had seen a lot of saloons, but the burlesque shows, we didn   t  have any of them in Webb City. A lot of people in Hollywood came out  of burlesque. Yeah those boom towns, they were something else. I  remember one time, well we had a kind of like arcane comedy. We had a  bunch of little kids that would run around together that were five or six  years old and the town marshal up there   a big tall guy that wore  western clothes and carried two pearl hand revolvers and a big 10-gallon  30  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  Cullison  Finchum  hat. We followed him all over town and he was our hero. I remember  one time we had a mad dog, that was pretty common thing back then, a  lot of rabid animals, and he emptied both his guns in that dog and I  guess he finally bled to death but he couldn   t kill him. When they go  rabid, nothing stops them, they   re just crazy. But he finally killed the  dog. I guess it bled to death because he shot him so much. Something  like that leaves an impression on a young kid. They   ll never forget. I   ve  about run out of stories. (Laughs)  Alright. We can stop anytime you want to.  Okay I think I   m ready. (Laughs)  Thank you for coming.  You   re welcome.  It has been a pleasure hearing your stories.  -------  -------
