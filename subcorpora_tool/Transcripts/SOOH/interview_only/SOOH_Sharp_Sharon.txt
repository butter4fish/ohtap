 Finchum  Sharp  Today is July 7, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, part of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. I   m in Oklahoma City to speak with Sharon Sharp  regarding her memories and experiences with former U.S. senator and  Oklahoma governor, Henry Bellmon. Thank you for having me today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little about yourself, where you were  born, and then we   ll work our way forward.  I was born in Nowata, Oklahoma and lived on a family cow/calf ranch in  northeastern Oklahoma that my family ran for many years up in  northeastern Oklahoma by Lenapah, Oklahoma actually. That   s where I  went to grade school. Lenapah, very small school almost all the way to  Kansas, up close to the Kansas border. I have three brothers, and we  lived pretty remotely. I was a tomboy and rode horses. Horses are my  passion in life. I love all animals, but    My dad used to take me out in  the pasture when I was just a little girl on a horse with him. And my dad  was the idol of my life. (Cries) It   s hard to talk about my dad. Excuse  me.  My dad and my mother were very involved in Republican politics in the  state at that time. There were hardly any Republicans in Oklahoma at  that time, especially in Northeastern Oklahoma. Well, my dad was the  Republican county chairman for the Republican Party for Nowata  County. I don   t remember the exact date that Henry Bellmon became  Oklahoma state chairman of the Republican Party. He was talked into it  by some people. He was a farmer in Billings, had no money, and the  chairman didn   t make anything. These people got together and  convinced him to be the chairman and that they would put together the  money to pay him so that he could be chairman.  5  When he became chairman, then my dad, that   s when they got involved,  really. My mother and dad were very active, going to meetings,  conventions and things like that, and working with Henry Bellmon. I  was very, very young. I don   t remember what age I was, but their oldest  daughter is the same age as my brother. I   m the same age as Gail and  one of my younger brothers is the same age as Ann. So we kids played  together a lot, got into a lot of  mischief  a lot of times. We didn   t  understand, really, politics, what that was, at that time. But we just knew  each other so our families have known each other for a long time. That   s  how I first got to know him, more as a father figure than as a political  person, really.  My dad ran for Congress from the Northeastern District against Ed  Edmondson in 1960, and he lost. Then in 1962, Henry Bellmon was  going to run for governor and he wanted my dad to run, and so my dad  ran for Congress in 1962. And of course, then when the Bellmons were  up in our territory in Northeastern Oklahoma, we all traveled together  and campaigned together and did all that. My dad lost. He got 49 percent  of the voting public, which was extreme to run against Ed Edmondson,  who was a longtime incumbent Democrat. It kind of showed that the  conservative Democrats were really coming around to the party side.  Henry Bellmon, really, truly, there was no Republican Party before he  became chairman. He built the party and gathered people together and  really showed people what the Republicans could do and what the  Democrats had kind of been doing. People,    Oh, well, I don   t want to be  run like that,    anyway, just gathered a lot of support and everything.  So when Henry Bellmon won, he asked my dad to move to Oklahoma  City and become his Secretary of the School Land Commission. It was a  very controversial job at that time because it had always been lawyers,  and it had always been heavily Democrat. You answered to a  commission. There were three Democrats, and I think there was one  Republican. I can   t remember who the head of the commission was. But  anyway, the head of the commission, actually, my father did not want to  do it. He didn   t want to leave the ranch and everything, but Henry  Bellmon just really wanted him to do this, because he knew that my  father was ethical, he could be trusted. My father never lied, ever. He  just was that kind of person. He was very strong. He could do the right  thing, and he would do the right thing.  There was a lot of work that needed to be done on the School Land  Commission because for years and years and years, people that rented  that school land paid nothing for it. The revenue from school land is  what goes into the education system for the state. So, really, the  education system was being cheated because this very good farmland  6  and ranchland was being leased for nothing. The people were spending  their money on huge homes and all this stuff. Henry Bellmon, he just  didn   t think that was right. Well, neither did my dad. So, anyway, they  had a common goal there to make more money for the education system,  but it was going to be a tough, tough job.  So the commission chairman talked to Daddy and convinced him to  move, much to my dismay. I did not want to move to Oklahoma City. I  did not want to leave the ranch. It was scary, and I was a tomboy, and it  was pretty frightening to me to move and leave. So my family moved to  Oklahoma City, and he became the school land commissioner. There  were times that there were people that would threaten him because he  was raising their lease and everything. He had the full support of the  governor, of course, Henry Bellmon, and the commissioner, the  chairman of the board, and everybody, so he got through that really well.  Henry Bellmon does talk about that in his book.  I went to John Marshall High School then, when we moved to Oklahoma  City, started there in the seventh grade. I went all six years, from seventh  through the twelfth, there at John Marshall in Oklahoma City. Then I  went to Oklahoma State University, and my whole family went to  Oklahoma State University. In fact, my mother graduated from there  when she was sixty-five. She went back to school and got her degree.  We do bleed orange. (Laughter) But during those first governor years,  still again, politics was not big in my mind. It was just getting through  school and trying to learn to wear a dress to school every day and  makeup and hair. That   s all these girls want to talk about, and all I want  to do is go ride a horse somewhere  (Laughter) Anyway, so we would go  over to the mansion a lot and play with the girls and stuff, and Daddy  and Henry would meet. Shirley and my mother, of course, were real  good friends. They were really good family friends.  So that   s where I initially knew him. Then I went to high school,  graduated, went to OSU, graduated, and then I stayed in Stillwater and  worked for the USDA  United States Department of Agriculture . The  State USDA is in Stillwater. I went to work there. I   d been there for  about five years or so and loved living in Stillwater. I continued to go to  all the games, never missed a game. My younger brothers then came and  went to school. My older brother was still there when I was there and  then my younger brother came up there. So we were all kind of there  together, pretty much. It was a lot of fun and everything, but I just  wanted to do something different.  My parents had a friend in Dewey Bartlett   s office. They said,    Well,  call him up and see what kind of jobs       I really wanted to work for the  FAA  Federal Aviation Administration . I don   t know why, but I  7  thought that would be a really cool job and be down here in the city and  it would be really fun. I called him up and of course, he was all about  helping me get a job and everything, and he knew some people at the  FAA. So he calls me back. This is in 1974. He called me back and he  said,    Sharon, I can help you with the FAA, but there   s somebody that   s  going to call you, and I think you need to think seriously about what she  wants to interview you for.    Gave me her name and I was,    Okay.     So she called me. Shirley. Shirley from Henry Bellmon   s Oklahoma  City office, and she interviewed me to go to Washington, DC and work  with Henry Bellmon in the US Senate. They were kind of adding people  to his staff and everything, and I said no. I was very scared. I had not  been east of Arkansas, literally. That was the year of the big energy  crisis, and on TV all you ever saw were people shooting people for gas  at the pumps up there in DC. It was very scary to me. I was very small-town,  even though I lived in Oklahoma City, and so I didn   t go.  Immediately after I didn   t go, I regretted it. I thought,    That   s crazy   Why wouldn   t you do that?    Anyway, I was very lucky two years later  in 1976, early-1976, they called me again, and they had a position up  there to work with the legislative folks to get their files in order and  different other pieces of jobs. So I said,    Yes, I will go.    So I did, and  that   s when I went up to DC to work for him as a US senator.  He was the only person I knew up there, didn   t know anybody else. We  hauled everything of mine up there. My brother and my parents drove  me up there, and I stayed with the Bellmons for the first month. My  apartment up there wasn   t going to be ready for another month, so I  lived with them for that first month, and it was very intimidating to me.  But the people in the office there, everybody was from Oklahoma, just  about. I think just about everybody was from Oklahoma and so nice and  accommodating and just the salt-of-the-earth people. So I fit right in I  felt like, and became   of course, they   re still my true, long-term friends  that we   ve made all these years. I started working for him in the  legislative department and making files and putting together an  organization chart for all the bills he   d sponsored and co-sponsored and  kind of organizing the legislative assistance so they could find things  and have a record and be able to find things immediately about what  they   d done, basically.  I started out in that piece and then his   he had a long-time secretary,  Cathy Buchanan. She was about ten years older than me, but she had  been with him for a very long time. She was his assistant, but she just  couldn   t quite make it to work until about eleven o   clock in the morning  and Henry Bellmon was a very early, early-riser. Our office opened at  nine, but he was always there by eight or even earlier. Seven-thirty  usually is when he liked to get there. There was another girl who was his  8  assistant, Suzy Thompson, and she was there early. There would always  be somebody there when he was there. She took dictation.  Henry Bellmon didn   t like to talk to a dictation machine. He wanted a  person sitting there writing down what he was saying. Not too many  people even knew dictation. I mean, it kind of faded out over the years.  However, that was one of my main skills. I loved shorthand. I started  doing shorthand when I was in the tenth grade in high school. So I was  really, really fast, and Cathy Buchanan was the same way. She   d taken  shorthand for years and years, and we took the same shorthand. But I  didn   t use my shorthand in the beginning until Suzy left and moved back  to Oklahoma. I think she moved back to Oklahoma. Then he needed  somebody to be the early person, and so I started sitting in for Suzy  when she was going back and forth and then I just got that job, too. I  kind of did both for a while. I would do the early part for him when he  had letters. He would answer phone calls and do letters in the morning,  early. That was what he liked to do. So we   d sit there and do letters or  statements or something like that. Then Cathy would come in around  eleven, and it was always kind of a joke, but then she would stay late.  (Laughs) See, she would stay like into the evening hours when he would  have late   the Senate would sometimes go until ten or eleven o   clock  sometimes. Well, she would always stay and do that so it was kind of a  wash between everybody.  Cathy literally took me under her wing, because there   s no book that will  tell you how to work in Washington, DC. None. You really have to learn  by fire, and it   s a blazing fire. Things happen really fast and furious.  And to get to know everything and where you go and what you do, how  you handle different people, you just had non-stop people from  Oklahoma that would come up there. A lot of them upset about different  things and everything. You had to learn how to handle those people, and  he was a master. He was a master at handling people. He could calm a  room just by walking in there. It was amazing to see him. So Cathy and  I, then, working together, we sat in the same room with each other and  then Henry Bellmon   s office was right there next to us, and he was right  there. If he needed something, we were right there. I would help her with  the schedule a lot of times. If people wanted it, I could put things on the  schedule and learned how to do a schedule from her. We could read each  other   s shorthand, which came in handy sometimes, because you tend to  make up your own words and how to spell things.  Sometimes if you couldn   t read it   and the biggest challenge was a lot  of times Henry Bellmon didn   t work from a draft. You typed it and that  was it. Or he would come over from the Senate floor and he would  dictate a statement to you on whatever was going on and then he would  go back to the floor. You would literally have to sit there and type it as  9  fast as you could on this electric typewriter. This electric IBM, which  was pretty cool from the typewriters that   we had moved up to Selectric  Typewriters. You   d type it as fast as you could and take it over there. It  was not a draft. It had to be what he said, because he would take it and  he would read it and then throw it in the box up there, and it would go  into the Congressional Record. It was one of those things that we just  worked together so well and could read each other   s writing, shorthand  and that helped us out a lot in those times. Then we got a correcting  Selectric typewriter that had a correcting  feature . That was one of the  coolest things that happened, when we got our Selectric correcting  typewriters. No computers back then.  So, anyway, I worked for him there at the US Senate until he left the  Senate. He didn   t run. He was up there two terms and then he didn   t run.  He did not like being a senator. He liked his governor   s office days. He  felt like he had more control as a governor. He could see things that  actually happened. In the US Senate, he said it was like watching a dead  stump grow, because you wrote your bills and everything in committee  and then it would go out to the floor and people would change it and all  kinds of things would happen to it. You had to have all  99 other  people  voting on it, and it was just hard, very hard to get things through that he  thought were really important and important to the country.  He wasn   t a big social person at all. He would go to events that were  Oklahoma-based, like the Oklahoma Bankers, if they came up. The  different organizations would come up and they would have receptions.  They would always want him to come. We just got endless invitations to  receptions all the time. National organizations, particularly, wanted a US  senator to come to the reception. Well, we did those. The staff would go  to the receptions and things. We   d take those invitations. But if it was  Oklahoma involved with anything with Oklahoma, he would definitely  show up early. He did not drink at all and neither did Shirley. A lot of  those things were cocktails and all of that stuff. But he would go, show  up, say hello, talk to people, and then leave, because he was a very  early-to-bed guy. He would go to bed early, and then he would get up in  the middle of the night and do some work, like one or two o   clock in the  morning, and then he was up early the next day. His house was on the  way in so a lot of mornings I would stop and pick him up.  Driving in Washington, DC traffic was not easy. It was like it kind of  made you a different person when you got behind the wheel, because  you had to be very aggressive to get into the traffic, and then the traffic  all came together at the bridges where you had to go across to get to the  capitol. So Henry Bellmon, I would pick him up, he   d put his seatbelt  on, and he would put his hand on the dash and then he would be ready to  go. (Laughs) He drove this car that was a Grenada. I mean, it was just  10  this old car. It had a three on the  column , it had no radio, it had no air  conditioning, it had no power steering. A lot of times we, as the staff,  would have to   depending on where he flew out of or in, we would  have to take that car back and forth, shuttle it to the different parking  spaces. It was like a lottery that,    Okay, who is going to drive?    It was  just horrible because in the heat or the winter, it was just a horrible car to  drive. But he loved that car. He didn   t use the clutch much so that   s why  it was kind of difficult to drive.  But, anyway, he was a lot of fun in Washington, and we were a very,  very close staff, very small staff. All the senators got the same amount of  money for their staff no matter where you were from. You could either  have a big staff or a small staff, and then you paid your people  accordingly. We made pretty good money because we had a small staff,  but everybody had a lot of  work . Staffs like the Kennedys or the Doles,  they had huge staffs. You would talk to their staff and there were four  people living in an apartment because they couldn   t afford anything. But  that   s because their boss chose to have many, many people, where our  boss had the confidence that we would be able to do it, and we did. We  had a lot of success in that way. Then he decided not to run when  Reagan took office. He just was ready to go home. Just about every  weekend he would go home to Oklahoma and spend the weekend there  and then come back to DC. He missed his farm a lot.  When he left DC and went back to Oklahoma, the staff kind of scattered.  Some people moved back to Oklahoma. I moved to Colorado for a short  time and then moved back to Oklahoma. He moved back to the farm. He  was doing a lot of different things. People would want him to speak and  do different things. Of course, he was at Oklahoma State University  before it was Oklahoma State University and he got involved there with  OSU and taught classes on government, federal government and state  government. He loved that. He taught honors classes, I believe. He loved  that. He loved doing that. He loved teaching people about government.  Government was important to him. He always thought of the better  good. He looked toward the better good of the whole country. He always  wanted the best for Oklahoma and the whole country. He was always  thinking in that way.  So, he went back to Oklahoma. I went to Colorado just for a short time. I  had a cousin that lived out there. I loved it out there. I thought about  staying, but I really couldn   t. I went back to Oklahoma, and I went to  work for an oil company in Tulsa, MapCo, which doesn   t exist anymore.  I worked there for not quite two years, and that   s when Governor Nigh  asked Henry Bellmon to come help with DHS to help Mr. Rader leave  DHS. Not an easy task. Mr. Rader and Henry Bellmon were very good  friends, and Henry Bellmon always made time for Mr. Rader. Mr. Rader  11  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  would not make appointments. He showed up in Washington, DC to see  Henry Bellmon, and he always made time to see Mr. Rader when he  came up there.  Very funny stories about those two up there in Washington, DC because  Mr. Rader always had these big secret things to talk to Henry Bellmon  about. He didn   t want anyone else in the office. Henry Bellmon always  honored that very much. They were longtime friends. That   s why  George Nigh thought that Henry Bellmon would be somebody that could  step in there and convince Mr. Rader that he should retire and enjoy the  rest of his life. And he did, I mean, he did a good job. But he called me  and he wanted me to come over and work, of course, in the DHS office  there in Oklahoma City. Of course, I said yes, much to my boss   s  David  Leslie  dismay in Tulsa.   David , in fact, had a little TV in his office. And I   ll never forget, I  didn   t even know about it, but they  Henry Bellmon and George Nigh   did a press conference and it was on the news. And my boss came into  my office and said,    Well, I guess now you   re going to be moving to  Oklahoma City.    I said,    Why?    (Laughs) And he said,    Well, your boss  has just accepted to be head of the DHS to help Mr. Rader move on and  to find a new director.    I said,    Really? That   s very interesting.    Well,  later that afternoon, sure enough, I got the phone call from Henry  Bellmon asking me to come over and work. And of course, I couldn   t  say no. I   d work for him   if he wanted me to work for him, I   d follow  him to the ends of the earth. The thing about the staff of Henry Bellmon  is it   s the loyalists. You   ll probably rarely find so many people so loyal  to a man. It   s unusual. (Crying)  It   s okay.  We miss him.  People who got to work for him and with him, they   re a lucky group.  Goodness. Now, I have really red eyes. So anyways, Claudia Scribner  and I went to work immediately for Henry Bellmon there in the  Department of Human Services. And there was just so much under that  agency, so many things. Andrew Tevington could probably tell you  more about all that, but I mainly just focused on taking care of Henry  Bellmon and what he needed and the letters and correspondence. Again,  correspondence was my main job because of my shorthand and  everything. And phone calls and screening calls and doing that. Sam  Armstrong  Lopez  came over and worked with us also. He had worked  for Channel 5, I think that was the station. And Henry Bellmon did a  thing on Channel 5, a little snippet,  Plainly Speaking , a little editorial-  12  type thing, and Sam was the editor and producer for it. They always got  along really well, and so he came over and started working for us.  There was just a lot that went on during those DHS years. But anyway, I  worked for him for those years that he was there, and he brought Bob  Fulton to work, and we worked with the Human Services Commission  there. You know, the commission, those guys were appointed for nine  years. I also became the secretary of the commission and did all the   minutes  for all the meetings and kept all the records and did that, too,  while I was working for Henry Bellmon. Well, being single and  everything, when Henry Bellmon left and Bob Fulton took over, I stayed  with Bob as the commission secretary, because I needed a full time job. I  had to have a full time job.  I stayed there at DHS and worked. Henry Bellmon  had said he  was not  going to run for governor again. He   d pretty much decided that. But  there were a lot of people who pretty much decided,    Yes, you are.     (Laughs) There was a movement that went out and raised money and got  a pretty big war chest to come back to Henry Bellmon and say,    Okay,  all these people want you to run. You ought to run.    So he consented to  run and when he did that, it was a short campaign, because it was the  year of the election that he made his announcement. And so I went to  work on a contract basis. I remained full time at DHS, but at night I  worked on the campaign on a contract basis, doing anything and  everything that anybody and everybody wanted. We all kind of did  everybody   s jobs. The only thing I didn   t do was knock on doors. I hated  that. I did not like knocking on doors, but I would do anything else.  So we did the campaign and then we won, and so then I went to work as  his personal assistant there in the governor   s office for those four years.  That was another exciting adventure because it was totally different than  the US Senate. The people that you worked with, the legislators, the  Oklahoma legislators   pretty different from the US Senate and  Congress. That was a whole new learning experience again. Again,  something you can   t learn in a book. You really have to just learn it  while you   re there. We had people come back. We had a girl that  worked with us in DC that came back from Seattle. Literally, put her life  on hold and came back and worked those four years in the governor   s  office. Just, again, the loyalty of his staff to be there and work with him  was such a pleasure and an honor. And of course, everybody wanted to.  He had certain things he wanted to do those four years. He told us he  was not going to run for a second term early on. He wanted things to be  done in that first term, and he did get them done.  It was exciting, and it was exhausting those four years I was there. Then  after those four years, I knew way ahead of time that I was going to have  13  to find another job. Pretty exhausted, I wanted to do something fun so I  decided to move to Colorado, and I moved out there. I went out there  already. I had friends in Crested Butte, Colorado, and so I would go out  there in the summer and winter and play with them and have fun and  everything. And they were all just,    Well, gosh, you   ve got to move out  here.    I thought,    Well, that would be fun for a while to move out  there.    You didn   t make any money. I took a huge cut in pay. I did get a  job. On the day that we turned the office over, Henry Bellmon left office  and we turned it over to the next governor, I moved to Crested Butte,  Colorado, and I lived there for ten years. Too long, really, but it   s just  such a    It was paradise on earth.  I loved my job even though I made no money. It came very close to  breaking me, because you can   t even make ends meet, because they  don   t pay. But the quality of life is so extreme. Everything that I loved to  do, horseback riding all summer and then skiing and doing that kind of  thing in the winter and working with all the groups that came up there.  Skiing was part of my job. I mean, I worked with the groups, and I  worked with the special events, and it was just fun the whole time that I  was there. I was healthy and fit, weighed about thirty-five pounds less  than I do now, and I was the healthiest I was in, really, my whole life up  there and really enjoyed it. But then the resort decided to sell part of the  resort to Club Med, came in there, everybody thought it was a bad  decision. It was kind of a shortsighted thing. They really went for the  cash. Different owners now, which are doing a very good job with the  resort.  What happened was that in last two years that I was there, we franchised  with the Marriott organization. The Marriott organization, they kind of  strong-armed me into being the person that was the contact. I really  didn   t want to do it, but I did. It turned out to be a very fun thing to do.  For two years I traveled for Marriott to all the reservation centers, to all  the offices, to the corporate headquarters, finding out what we needed to  do as a franchise, getting the word out about Crested Butte, where we  are, what we do, what we stood for. I did presentations all across the  country. I was on the road, in a plane almost every day a different  location for almost a solid two years. At the end of that time, that   s when  the company owners decided that they could sell the hotel, which was  the Marriott Hotel, to Club Med, and they made a lot of cash. But at that  point, I   m just,    I   ve got to get a real job. I really do. I   ve got to go out  and get a real job.    I talked to them about leaving. There really was  nothing there for me that would add money, a significant amount of  money to my salary.  So the Marriott people, though, really wanted me to come work for  them. They offered me a really good deal, moving back to Oklahoma. I  14  Finchum  Sharp  had an offer in Denver, which I wanted to stay in Denver. I really  wanted to stay in Colorado, mainly because of the weather. I also had an  offer in Oklahoma and after talking to the girl that was the director at the  Oklahoma City Marriott, here in Oklahoma City, I decided to move back  to Oklahoma and take that position. My parents had sold the ranch about  three years before   two years, actually, before this time because my  father had been having some health problems. He didn   t want to leave  the ranch with my mother and all the problems that go with it. So they  moved to Edmond to be close to my older brother. So they were in  Oklahoma City then. I decided because of my family being there and a  lot of my friends being there, that I would move back to Oklahoma even  though I had said when I was in Colorado that I would never move back  to Oklahoma. Never say never. Henry Bellmon had always said,    You  will come back to Oklahoma.    I was just,    No, I won   t.    He said,    Yes,  you will.     The first week that I was at the Oklahoma City Marriott, guess who  walked through the front door of the Marriott. It was Henry Bellmon. He  came to take me to lunch and to say,    I told you you   d move back to  Oklahoma.    (Laughter) He was very happy that I was back in Oklahoma  and I was too. I was here for a long time. I was there about three years. It  was a corporate hotel, and they sold it to a franchise. And the franchise  was just not a good company. They   re the ones that have it today. They  tried to move me back to Colorado, it didn   t work so I had to move to  Dallas in order to stay with Marriott. Since I needed a job, and it was a  good job, I did move to Dallas and lived down there for four years  before I moved back here to Oklahoma again.  Henry Bellmon was always a big part of my family. He was. He was  really more like a father to me than he ever was an employer.  Everywhere I went, he was always interested in what I was doing and  where I was and what I was up to and everything. He was very happy  that I moved back to Oklahoma and got to see him several times. A  bunch of us would get together, and we would go up there to Billings  and see him at the farm. He would have wonderful parties at the farm.  Everybody would come from all over the country to come to his parties.  The last big party that we had up there was his eighty-fifth birthday that  the girls put together and had for him. It was just wonderful to see  everybody, a lot of people that I hadn   t seen in years and things like that.  So that   s just kind of the synopsis of the whole  thing . I do have stories.  Let   s go back to when your dad was campaigning and Henry was  campaigning at the same time, some stories in there.  Ann Bellmon, and she knows this, but she was the instigator of a lot of  things, ideas to get us into  mischief  when we were campaigning at  15  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  these different places. You   d go to these places and we would go off  kind of on our own, and then we   d get into  mischief , have to come  back to wherever the event was going on and things like that. We would  hand out campaign brochures and things to different people that were  there. That was kind of our job. The kids go up,    Vote for my daddy,     and stuff like that. One of the things I did   and again, when you   re that  young you just don   t really get the whole political thing anyway   but  we were at an event and Ed Edmondson was there, too, because he was  campaigning. It was a huge event up in, I think it was Pawhuska is  where it was, some big thing they have every year, and so everybody  was there, all the candidates were there and everything. So he was there.  At one point I went up and gave him one of my dad   s brochures and  asked him to vote for my dad. He gave it back to me and said,    I know  that your dad is a very wonderful guy, but I probably won   t be voting for  him.    Then he introduced himself as who he was and then,    I   m the one  running against your father.    I was like,    Oh, gosh, I   m so  embarrassed     But, anyway, it was a big laugh and everything.  But we would travel together when they were up in Northeastern  Oklahoma and do different things, and we were just, really, a bunch of  kids having a good time. You see these old station wagons that  everybody used to travel in. That was what we traveled in. (Laughs) It  wasn   t anything fancy. It was a lot of fun. You really get to know people  that way, and you find out that they were so similar to my mom and dad,  Henry and Shirley Bellmon. The things they believed in, the right and  wrongs, how you raised your children. Shirley was a stay-at-home  mother. My mother was a stay-at-home mother. It was just the way it  was. I have very fond memories of those times of traveling with them.  And then moving to Oklahoma City was just really hard. But even in  Oklahoma City, we   d go visit them at the mansion and do different  things together. We still had a lot of interaction, but went to different  schools. Of course, they were over in the northeast side of town, and we  were more in the Village, John Marshall-type. But they went to public  school so they were at Northeast, I think, is where they actually went to  school. Not sure. But anyway, so we saw each other every so often there  in the first governor   s office. But really, as far as anything political or  anything like that, I just knew them as family friends.  Do you remember election night, the actual night of the election?  Of the governor   s election in    62?  Yes.  I just remember that my dad lost. Just before, like a couple of months  before, my dad was ahead in the polls. It was really tight. It was a fifty-  16  fifty deal. They were actually looking for a place to live in DC. That, to  me, was   all I can remember is how scared I was, the thought of  moving, number one, from the ranch, but number two, to Washington,  DC. It was just a million miles away and frightening, frightening. I was  twelve. It was just really, really scary. So when he lost, it was a huge  relief to me. It was. I just was very happy because at that time, I didn   t  realize even the significance that Daddy had won about 49 percent of the  vote. I mean, I just didn   t even realize that. I did later when I got older  and knew what really went on back then. We were not in Oklahoma  City, that I recall, for the big election night.  I didn   t go to the inauguration or anything, but my parents did. My  mother tells about how cold it was that day, and he  Henry Bellmon   didn   t have gloves. He didn   t have any gloves on, and he was real bad  about putting his hands in his pockets anyway. People kept saying,     Keep your hands out of your pockets.    So, Shirley had, on most of his  suits and coats, she had sewn the pockets together so he couldn   t put his  hands in his pockets. (Laughter) Mother said she remembers that  Shirley   s dress, something with her hem. Mother had given her pins to  hold up her dress. That   s how basic    When he won governor it was a  shock, I think, to the whole state. People were looking for something  new, somebody that they could believe in and somebody they could look  up to and would do the right thing.  He was very controversial because he did do what he believed in his  heart was the good thing. He didn   t listen to mail  campaigns . Just  because it was the popular thing to do, he didn   t do it. He researched it  and then he would move forward with it as he believed was the right  thing to do. Especially during the Panama Canal, we had people that  were terribly nasty and terribly rude that wrote terrible things about him  and were very mad about things that he did. Through his whole career,  actually, but he always got elected. He would get re-elected, and he got  elected as governor again when he came home, because he said it was  kind of like your parents, really. You tell them you hate them sometimes  because they do things that you hate, and you make a lot of noise and  you scream a lot. But when it all comes down to it, you know they   re  going to take care of you, and you know they   re going to do the right  thing so they vote for you. The people do.  That   s why he got re-elected, because he did the right thing and because  people did respect him. The decisions he made were correct and right,  and they respected that. That was always kind of funny because during  some of that stuff, it was kind of scary coming back to Oklahoma,  because people hated what he was doing. And they were just,    He   ll  never come back to Oklahoma.    Well, he came back and ran for  governor and won. So you get a lot of that, but anyway, it was a big  17  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp   inauguration  day  in 1962 . There were hundreds of people that came  to the capitol. Mother said it was kind of scary at times, because the  crowd was so big and they were all in the capitol, and  the ball  was free.  He wasn   t charging at all for people to come to this event. He thought it  should be open to everybody in Oklahoma that wanted to come, no  matter if you   re poor or whatever. So everybody came. I wasn   t there.  I   ve seen pictures from there and, of course, Mother and Dad just  reminiscing about it and everything. That was all new. That was an all  new direction, and so it was the beginning of, really, a stable, real  Republican Party in the state of Oklahoma. First Republican governor,  so it was huge.  Do you want to say what your father   s name was?  My father was Bill Sharp.  How had he come to be a Republican, do you know?  I was born in 1950, and he was already then Republican chairman of  Nowata County so he got involved. There were some really strong  Republicans, few as there were up there. John Tyler in Bartlesville, and  there was a Mrs. Kelly in Bristow, up in northeastern Oklahoma. Tulsa,  of course, had more Republicans than probably any other town in  Oklahoma. Daddy was a good friend of John Tyler   s up in Bartlesville  and several of those folks, and I think that   s how he got involved,  originally. He didn   t believe in the Democrats and what they wanted to  do. The Democrat Party back then was a bunch of bullies, really. They  did what they wanted to do, and they took kickbacks, and they did all  kinds of stuff that my father really, really disagreed with. I think that   s  why he got involved, because he saw that there had to be a better way.  That ethics and good for everybody, it could be good for everybody. He  believed in the two-party system. You need two parties to really balance  out your state. I think he really strongly believed in that. I don   t know  exactly, but I believe that   s probably why, because he didn   t think the  Democrats were doing the right thing, and he thought having a  Republican Party in Oklahoma, a strong Republican Party would make a  real difference.  Were his parents Republicans? Do you know?  I don   t know. His father was a very, very, very gruff man. He talked my  dad out of going to college and staying with the ranch. He made a lot of  promises to my dad that he never kept. My dad, because of who he was,  he stayed. He went to the war, World War II. He went over to England,  actually. He was in England, and I   ll tell you a funny story. My dad,  who   d worn cowboy boots  all his life    my dad was a cowboy. He  18  managed rodeos, actually, around the country. He was also in a western  band, played the guitar and a little bit of banjo. But, anyway, he dated  Reba McEntire   s aunt. She was a trick rider in the rodeo. We have  pictures of that. That was kind of funny.  Clark  McEntire was a good  friend of his and a lot of country western people. He participated in the  rodeos, too. But, anyway, he was a real cowboy. He was a rodeo clown  also. He had a partner. They had a mule. He would tell people that you  got  100 each if you were a rodeo clown, then. It was the best paid job  going. We have pictures of him and his mule. And his mule would do  tricks, it was so funny. But we have his little kit that he used to make up  his face and everything. So they did a lot of rodeos as rodeo clowns, too.  Bulls were always his favorite, Brahma Bulls. He loved the bulls. When  I moved back to Oklahoma that was like one of my jobs, to go to the bull  rodeos with my dad and the rodeos, because my mother hated rodeos.  She didn   t like to go to the rodeos and particularly not the bull riding  stuff. So my dad, when I moved back to Oklahoma, I took him to every  one that came down, because that   s what he wanted. He loved doing  that. But he was a cowboy, and he wore boots all his life, and it had     because of the way your boots are, it had shortened the muscle in the  back of his foot, your leg, that goes down to your heel. He could not  wear army boots. They were very uncomfortable. He couldn   t walk very  far in them at all. So he had special permission to wear cowboy boots in  the army. So, in England, we have pictures of him and all these little  kids around him because they just thought it was so cool, this cowboy  and his cowboy boots and his army uniform. So, anyway, that was just  kind of funny.  But when he came back from the  war  and he had sent all his money to  his dad to buy cattle, to build the ranch up and everything and to buy the  rest of the land for the ranch. We had a ranch and a farm. The ranch was  about 1,300 acres, and the farm was about 800 acres, so it was about  2,000 acres all together. When Daddy came back from the war, he went  to work at the ranch, raising a cow/calf operation, I believe. They had  horses at first. He had horses for a while. He raised just about  everything. We had sheep, we had pigs, we had horses for a while. But  horses, you weren   t making any money on horses so he did get rid of all  the horses except he kept three or four just to ride and to herd cattle with  and everything like that. Then the main part that I remember after I was  born was the cattle, cow/calf operation. Raise the calf and then sell the  calves. But that was the main part.  And then he met my mother, who her father was with Sinclair. Sinclair  had a huge place there, and her father was the engineer in charge. They  had moved to Nowata from Kansas. My mother was born in Nebraska,  but they  had moved to  Kansas. And he kind of moved around. They  19  Finchum  moved around because of the oil business. My dad also owned, along  with working on the ranch, he had a Sinclair station in Nowata. So he  knew her father long before he knew her, because he worked with him  on the gas/oil level. And so my mother, when she walked to school  would walk by his station, and he literally decided that she was the one  for him. He asked her out, had to ask her out a bunch of times, she  would not go. (Laughs) Finally, she says,    I just finally went out with  him just to see       because he would send her flowers, and he would do  all this stuff.    Just to see if he was as crazy as he sounded.    Anyway, so  they dated for not very long, actually, and got married.  Then Mother, the city girl that she was, moved out to the ranch, and they  built a house. There wasn   t much out there. My grandfather and  grandmother lived in town. They lived in Nowata. They did not live on  the ranch. There was a cabin there on the ranch that it   actually, a lot of  outlaws stayed there as they were coming through Northeast Oklahoma.  Oklahoma was kind of the badlands for outlaws to go rob something and  then come in and hide their loot and stuff. Where this cabin was on the  ranch, there was a huge hill right next to it. And from the top of that hill,  you could see almost all the way to Nowata, which was fifteen miles. So  the sheriffs would find out that this is where those guys were hiding out,  they would come, but they would always be gone, and the food would  still be warm and everything on the table. But, you see, there was always  a watch out. They always knew they were coming. It was kind of an  outlaw cabin. There   s all kinds of artifacts that we used to find up there,  old guns and dice and all kinds of stuff from that. The Dalton brothers,  they hid out there and everything.  Anyway, they couldn   t live in that cabin so they built a house around the  cabin. The den and the living room were the original part of the cabin.  And if you looked in one of the closets of our house, you could still see  the old log part of the cabin. Anyway, it was built on the full kitchen and  bedroom downstairs. And then upstairs were two big rooms for the kids  and stuff, and so that was our house. My mother   s parents  also  Repblicans , who lived in Nowata, were always really worried about her  because it was so far away, and my mother couldn   t drive ever. She  didn   t learn to drive. Daddy finally taught her to drive because he would  go into town, and she was out there all by herself with these little kids.  So she had to learn to drive. That came in handy many times, but that  was our family home. It was kind of up on a hill, the big hill, and so  that   s where we lived until I was thirteen when we moved to Oklahoma  City.  That farm background helped, I guess, to build a relationship with Mr.  Bellmon, too.  20  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Right. That too, because I knew about farming and ranching, and I still  had a lot of country in me even though I went to John Marshall High  School and all that. There   s a lot of truth to,    You can take the girl out of  the country, but you can   t take the country out of the girl.    That   s  certainly true with me, because I   ve kind of been a cowgirl all my life. I  loved the horses, and I rode horses, and I had to do a lot of playing by  myself because my girlfriends   there were only three other girls in my  class in Lenapah, and they lived pretty far from me, so I would play with  my horse. We had two or three horses, and so I would always play with  the horses or play with the animals, because my brothers didn   t want to  play with me, pretty much. (Laughs) Our closest neighbors, they were  all boys. But, yes, I miss the ranch a lot. It was my home.  I   m guessing at OSU, you majored in business?  I did major in business at OSU, and I actually, back then, you had a  stenography business degree type thing. You had business law and those  kind of things, but you also had typing and shorthand and file  organization and those kind of things, which I don   t even think they  teach that stuff anymore at OSU. But, yes, I was a straight-A student  because my shorthand, my typing, those were my best subjects. And  shorthand was five hours so I had five hours of A every semester I took  it so it was pretty good. (Laughs) So, yes, but business law, psychology,  those classes too. You had to take those. That was part of the business.  And what year did you graduate?  Actually, I got an associate degree, and I graduated in 1971. And that   s  when I went to work for USDA there in Stillwater. I actually did a little  stint working for Global Life Insurance here in Oklahoma City, and I  hated it. I just hated it. So I applied for that job, it was available, a  secretary to one of the production guys up there, and got it. I really  enjoyed that. I was so young and didn   t know much about anything,  really. And the lady  Eva B. Wilson  that was the secretary to the  director there took me under her wing and took care of me, and still to  this day, she is like a second mother to me. She   s ninety this year,  turned, and she   s at a retirement home in Stillwater. I go up to see her  quite often. She never had any children, and so I   ve been like one of her  adopted children. I try to take care of her. But people through my life at  different jobs, they become lifetime friends   family, more like family,  really.  Sadly, Eva B. Wilson died August 2011.   Mr. Bellmon was like that with a lot of people it sounds like.  Yes. Yes. We were all his little chickens.  21  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  How did you refer to him? Mr. Bellmon or Governor Bellmon or  Senator?  He loved being called Governor in the US Senate, but we all called him  Senator. We all did. We referred to him as Senator. That was it. Then  later in the governor   s office, we did call him  Governor . It was hard to  go from Senator to Governor, but we did. So all the rest of the years  after the governor   s office, we always called him Governor, except when  we were talking about him. And when we were among ourselves talking  about him, it was Henry Bellmon. It was always Henry Bellmon. It  wasn   t Henry or it wasn   t Mr. Bellmon. It was Henry Bellmon, Henry  Bellmon, or HB. Everybody referred to him that way. You couldn   t  imagine saying his name without saying Henry Bellmon. You probably  noticed that when I   ve been talking about him because I say his first and  last name all the time. (Laughs) He loved being called Governor. That  was his favorite thing so when I   d call him up, I   d say,    Governor  How  are you doing?    (Laughs) He loved that.  Do you have some stories you want to tell about your DC time?  Yes, there   s a couple of stories that are my favorites. There   s endless  stories about him, and I can let other people tell those stories, but the  ones that affect me personally    One of my favorite ones was about  John Denver. I was a huge John Denver fan. I loved him so much. Henry  Bellmon rarely watched TV, unless it was the news. He knew nothing  about movie stars or music people, nothing. So, John Denver, we got  this piece of mail that John Denver was coming through town. John was  a big advocate for world hunger. You may know that. And Henry  Bellmon, on the appropriations committee, one of his sub-committees  was food and hunger. One of our staff guys, Woody, he was a legislative  assistant, was responsible for that piece of legislation. Anyway, so we  got this letter inviting Henry Bellmon, from Paul Simon, who was a  congressman at the time, was bringing John Denver to town. He had  done a movie, this short movie about world hunger, and he wanted to  show it to the US senators  on the  agriculture committee. It was through  the agriculture committee that Henry Bellmon was involved with the  hunger.  But anyway, so I saw this letter and I was just,    He   s coming to  Washington, DC     I couldn   t believe it. I was just so excited about it. So  I told him, I told Henry Bellmon. I said,    John Denver is coming,    and I  said,    I would just give anything to meet him  He   s wonderful, he   s a  great singer     He   s just like,    Who is he?    So I told him all about him,  and in fact, there was a special, a John Denver special, coming up in the  next couple of weeks, and so on that day I reminded Henry Bellmon that  when he got home, this was coming on and he needed to watch it  22  Finchum  Sharp  because that was John Denver   because he accepted Paul Simon   s  invitation to attend this event. It was nine o   clock in the morning. He  was coming to the capitol. It was by invitation only, certain senators, and  their legislative assistants that were responsible. Well, Woody was the  legislative assistant, but we booted him out of there real quick.  And so Henry Bellmon accepted to go, and he was going to take me.  (Laughs) I mean, it was a huge day for me so I had him watch the  special. He enjoyed the music, he said, and all that. So the day came and  I had a special dress that   it was a sweater dress. It was navy blue and it  had this top that looked like a ski sweater, it really did. Oh, it was just a  major day. So the day comes and Ed Musky and Henry Bellmon were  the budget committee grandfathers, really, they   re the ones that built the  committee. They started the committee, and they were co-chairmen of  the committee. Henry Bellmon was the minority chairman and Ed  Muskie was the majority chairman. Anyway, Ed Muskie had decided to  call a budget committee meeting for some reason that morning at nine  o   clock. Well, Henry Bellmon had to be there.  I was so disappointed. I just couldn   t believe that of all the days that Ed  Muskie would do that  He  Henry Bellmon  was apologetic and  everything. He was going to    So, I might have even cried. I just know I  was really, really disappointed. But this is Henry Bellmon. This is  exactly the man he is. So he goes over there, and he goes to that  committee, and he opens the committee. And then he excuses himself,  and he comes back over to the office, and he picks me up, and he takes  me to this thing. (Cries) Just for me. Anyway, it was really, really funny  because we get there and the room is just packed with people. Paul  Simon is up at the very front with John Denver, and he saw us walk in  and he says,    Henry  Henry  Come on up here     So we walk up to the  very front, with John Denver, introduces me to him, Paul introduces the  senator, tells who he is and everything and what a good friend and blah,  blah, blah, and all this stuff.  I   m just in this daze, because I can   t believe I   m standing there right  next to John Denver and everything. Anyway, it was a great day. Henry  Bellmon, then, told Paul Simon, he said,    You know Paul, I   ve got a  budget committee going, but can you take care of Sharon for me?    He  said,    Sure, we   ll be happy to,    sat me down on the front row and then  he went back to his committee. That was him. There   s not another US  senator that would do that for a staff member. I should   ve brought some  Kleenex. (Laughs)  Did he realize that John Denver was from Oklahoma at that time?  No, I don   t think he did. I didn   t bring that to his attention. It was all  23  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  about him being  a great singer and wonderful person .  I thought that would have made     Right, right. But see, it wasn   t about who it was     It was because you wanted     It was all about me because that   s what I wanted to do. He also did the  same thing with another staff member, Melissa, who is in Seattle now.  She   s the one that came from Seattle to Oklahoma to work for those four  years. But she is a big sailor and Jacques Cousteau was coming to a  breakfast. He accepted to that breakfast just so he could take Melissa to  that breakfast. He was just huge about that. He cared so much for other  people and his staff, particularly. We were just like his children, and we  were treated that way. I mean, his favorite thing to do was   because he  didn   t like going to those parties and the social things. But he and  Shirley would have all of us over to his house for barbecue and fried  okra. That was the biggest, most fun party. The girls will tell you, his  girls will tell you that we were more of a family to him than they were  sometimes. (Laughs) That   s the way he felt about us.  Another thing that he did was when I turned thirty   I don   t know why  when I turned thirty, I was really depressed. I don   t get depressed. I   m  very upbeat about everything usually. I try to make things work and I  see my glass half full. I don   t see it half empty. I see it half full all the  time. But for some reason turning thirty really, really bothered me.  Maybe because I wasn   t married, I had just broken up with a longtime  boyfriend, something. So Henry Bellmon asked Cathy because I wasn   t  the same spirited, upbeat person that I always was, and so he asked  Cathy about it. And Cathy said,    Well, she just turned thirty, and I don   t  know why, but she   s just a little depressed about it.    He said,    Well, we  need to do something about it. What can I do to get her back to herself?     As luck would have it, my birthday is June 1, so August of that year, he  was going on a trip. It was a special Congressional, Senate   actually,  just senators on this trip, four senators, to Europe, Belgium, Germany,  and the Norway and Sweden countries. It was a special trip, authorized  and requested by  Senator  Muskie, who was, at the time, secretary of   state . Anyway, it had to do with nuclear stuff. I never knew the whole  story, because it was all top secret stuff, classified and everything.  So he  Muskie  asked them to do this. It was sort of in the form of a  junket so nobody paid much attention to the thing. It was supposed to be  very low-key and everything, and Howard Baker was the head of the  trip. He and his wife were going and his staff only, and the protocol staff  from the state department were going, and that was it. It was Thad  24  Cochran from Mississippi and Senator  Bill  Cohen from Maine,  Republican senators, all, and Henry Bellmon going on this trip. We were  going on a US plane and everything. It was a huge deal.  Howard Baker had already informed everybody that it would only be   his staff  because usually whenever these things happened, every  senator brought their own staff, two or three people at least. He had  already told everybody that it was only his staff and the state department  staff, and that was it. Henry Bellmon and Howard Baker were very,  very, very good friends. Very close. So he called Howard Baker and  asked him if he had a secretary for the trip yet. And Howard said,    No, I  haven   t assigned anybody to that yet.    He said,    Well, if you can, can  my secretary come?    He said,    Well, we   ll just tell everybody she works  for me.    And I got to go on that trip. He   s funny. When he told me about  this, he called me in his office and he said,    Well, if you can stay out of  jail, I   ll take you on this trip.    He thought that was real funny. I just  couldn   t believe it  I couldn   t believe it.  So we go on this trip, and I   d never been to Europe at all. It was a big  deal. The funny thing was, though, we took an electric typewriter  because we were going to work on the way over there, do some  statements and some letters. I was working for all the senators and  Howard Baker and everything. When the plane took off, they hadn   t  secured the typewriter very well, and it flew across the plane. These  planes are set up like there   s seats, but then there   s tables and seats. And  then there   s big spaces where there   s tables where you can sit around.  Well, they had this typewriter supposedly latched to the wall on a table  on the side of the wall. And I don   t know what happened, but anyway, it  went flying across the room, broke into a million pieces. So I couldn   t  work on the way over  or back .  So, anyway, no one was in the mood to work anyway. We went over and  we went to Belgium first, and then we went to Germany. In Germany is  where they were going to do some tours or look at, investigate   I don   t  even know what they were doing, really, but some kind of nuclear thing.  Howard Baker and his personal staff got off in Germany and then Henry  Bellmon became head of the trip. We went to Norway, and then we went  to Sweden. No, we went to Sweden first, then we went to Norway, and  then we were going back to England to meet up with Howard Baker and  his people. The protocol people went with us, of course. And what  happens on those trips is you have an official passport, but you never see  it. The state department people take care of that. This girl Jan, she was in  charge of that, the protocol and all that. She was also in charge  of our  agenda . We had state dinners to go to in every country we were in. We  had receptions and all this other stuff we were supposed to go to. I never  saw my passport or anybody else   s passport the whole time.  25  Well, when we were in Sweden   of course, Henry Bellmon was the  head of the trip   but this guy I knew in the passport department that  helped us with our passports and everything, Michael, his brother-in-law  lived in Sweden. He was Swedish, and he was a movie producer,  actually. And so he had written to him that I was coming over and that  he should show me around and everything. So when we got there to the  hotel, I had a message from this guy. He wanted to take me out. Now,  we were only going to be there a couple of nights so not very long, and  so he wanted to take me to dinner and all this stuff. We had a state  dinner that night with the  Swedish  people. Jan, the protocol person,  told me I couldn   t go because it would be embarrassing, that they had  already said I was going to be there, and all this stuff. So I was just,     Well, that   s a heck of a deal.    And these state dinners were just so  boring and stuffy, really, they were. But anyway, so I told Henry  Bellmon and he said,    That is just ridiculous  You are not  You are  going out with that guy. You call him up right now and tell him to come  get you, and don   t you worry about the state dinner. I   ll take care of  that.    Well, from that time on, Jan just really didn   t like me very much.  (Laughs) I thought,    That   s just ridiculous      So I went out with this guy and it was great. He showed me Sweden and  all that stuff. Well, then we go to Norway and Phillips 66 at that time  had an offshore drilling rig in Stavanger, off the shore. Stavanger is  where you go, and then you take a helicopter out to the offshore drilling  rig. When we were in Norway, he  Henry Bellmon  wanted to take a  side trip and go to the offshore drilling rig. So I got everything, did his  schedule, and made all the arrangements with the hotel and made all the  arrangements with the drilling rig. I mean, it was all set up and  everything, ready to go, and he left. We went to England. So I get to  England and there   s this room. And every place we stopped, there was  this room called the control room that our navy liaison guy, who was  John McCain, he was the guy that took care of us on this trip. He and he  had two staff. He would set up this room that had drinks and snacks and  stuff in it. It had information, like if we needed a car to take us  somewhere, he   d make those arrangements, and we could trade money  there and stuff. There was always a person from the country that was  there from the embassy that staffed the room, took care of the passports  and did that stuff. So Jan would hand over the passports to that person  whenever she would arrive in whatever country we were in.  So I was sitting there when Henry Bellmon was supposed to be back in  England. And I was sitting there, literally, at the desk with this lady, and  he walks in and he says,    So       I said,    Hi, how are you doing?    He  said,    Do you know where I spent the night last night?    I said,    Well, I  hope that you were at,      whatever hotel it was      in Stavanger.    And he  26  Finchum  Sharp  goes,    Actually, I spent the night in a Stavanger jail.    And I said,     What? What do you mean?    He said,    Yes, I didn   t have my passport.     I   d sent him off without his passport. It didn   t even occur to me, didn   t  even think about the fact that he needed a passport. Today, it would  really be serious. I was just,    Oh, my gosh     I mean, I was just horrified.  I was completely horrified. I couldn   t believe I made such a huge  mistake  And he was just going on and on about it.  Well, he   s just the biggest practical joker you   ll find, and he was just  pulling my leg the whole time. Actually, what happened was that when  Jan gave all the passports to this lady, she was going through the  passports and noticed that Henry Bellmon   s passport was there, not with  him. So she immediately calls the customs authorities and said,    We  have a US senator travelling without his passport. Please offer him the  courtesy of allowing him to do whatever he is doing.    And, of course,  they did, took good care of him, got him to where he was going,  everywhere, did his Stavanger trip, spent the night in the hotel that he  was supposed to. But he just couldn   t resist making that joke on me that  he   d spent the night in jail, because he   d said that to me, remember, at  the first,    As long as you don   t go to jail.     Anyway, he was a funny guy. That was a great trip. It was really great. I  lost about ten pounds because I was up all the time, because everybody  wanted me to see everything. Everybody on that trip had been over there  several times. I was the only one that had never been there so they just  had all these places they wanted to show me. And then when I was in  Sweden, I was out almost all night with this guy, because he took me all  these different places and showed me everything about Stockholm, and  it was just    So it was quite a learning experience for me. That was  when I was thirty.  That was a nice birthday present.  Yes, it was very, very nice. (Laughs) One of my very best friends that I  made in Washington, DC was Henry Kissinger   s personal assistant for  many years. I believe about eighteen years. Anyway, her name is Chris  Vick, and we met working together at Children   s Hospital there in DC.  We were volunteers together. Chris told me before I went on that trip     because she   d been to Europe quite a few times and usually just in a  room working. She didn   t get out very much whenever she traveled with  Henry Kissinger. She said,    When you go, you should buy things. Don   t  buy tacky souvenirs. Buy things you   re going to use, like candlestick  holders and nice things to hang on the wall, or crystal glasses that you   re  going to drink out of. Those kinds of things are what you should buy  because then you will have them forever, and they will always mean a  lot to you, and you will actually use them when you have company and  27  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  everything.    That was the one piece of advice that was the best advice,  because that   s exactly what I did. And to this day, I have those very nice  things. And the presents I brought back to people were nice, beautiful  things that they actually use and will remember that that   s where it came  from and everything. But, yes, she was in awe of my boss and I was in  awe of her boss so it was kind of this mutual thing. We   re still, to this  day, just best friends. She   s a marvelous person.  Bonus from those DC days.  Absolutely. I can   t imagine not doing it. Plus, my friends today, my best  friends today, are from those days. I   ve got friends from high school and  college and everything, but the friends that I made in the Bellmon   years    I worked for Henry Bellmon for fifteen years, span, all those  years, different jobs. During the campaign I lived in a condominium  complex over here by Quail Springs, and they bought a condominium in  that same one, a little one because they were not here all the time. So I  would go over there and do his mail. I would still do his mail all the  time. Even after the governor   s office, for a short time. I left soon after,  but in between those times that he was even not running for governor. I  was working for DHS and the DHS commission, but I would do his mail  and help him with that and other stuff. It was kind of a constant time that  I worked for him all those years.  What is it about him that people are so loyal to?  It   s really    It   s kind of hard to say. I think it   s because of the respect he  has for you as a person, and he always respected your opinion. He  always wanted to hear it. This is from everybody. He wanted to hear  your opinion, he wanted to know why, and this is one thing that he  always, always   he never said,    Believe this because I said so.    He  never said that.    Believe this because       one, two, three, four. He  always gave you an answer. So, to me, in my experience, he was always  pretty easy to defend, even though it was difficult sometimes because so  many people were against him. So many people were against whatever  idea or whatever vote was going on or something like that. But I knew  why he did it. And he would tell you why. He could explain it to you in  laymen   s terms so that you did understand it. And you believed it and  you believed in him, because you knew that what he was doing was for  the good of everybody and it was the right thing.  When we were up there in the US Senate, it was during that time when  there was a lot of scandals going on. The Wilber Mills thing and there  were people having affairs and doing all that. Our staff? You never, ever  had to even worry about that kind of thing with our guy  He and Shirley  Bellmon, she was the love of his life. You knew that none of that would  28  ever apply to him. You knew that he was a totally faithful, totally, very  high morals, very high character. And you just had complete loyalty and  respect for him that you wanted to do anything you could to see that  what he wanted done got done. And that   s the path you took. You didn   t  want to embarrass him, ever. We tried not to. Maybe we did sometimes,  but he would take it with a grain of salt. (Laughs) It was literally, like  you were one of his kids and he treated you that way. His caring, Shirley  Bellmon, same way, she cared about everybody. She had a good heart. I  miss her. I miss her so much. And I miss him so much. We all miss him.  They were just two of the best of the best.  Oklahoma roots ran very, very deep with both of them. He had his funny  quirks. He could fall asleep at the drop of a hat, sleep for twenty  minutes, and be wide awake. He was just one of those people that could  take a cat nap and just be wide awake. People teased him about it a lot,  about him falling asleep. I remember a story about him in the war,  because he was at Iwo Jima. He was a marine, and he was a tank  operator. I remember just a snippet of a story that they had been in this  big confrontation, and he had saved people. And they finally had won  the battle, basically, that they were in. He was found leaning up against a  tree, just totally asleep. His buddy thought that he was dead, and so he  goes over to him and no, he was just catnapping there on the tree   He never drank. Shirley was a big teetotaler, but he just never drank. We  never drank in front of him. That was just the way it was. (Laughs) But,  yes, it   s hard to say how those loyalties become, but it   s the man that     he just did. You just were very loyal to him. If he would   ve run for  governor again, I would have been right there. I would have stayed as  long as he stayed. But when he retired, I mean semi-retired, he went to  OSU. Then he didn   t really have full-time work for somebody that  needed full-time work. Claudia  Scribner  went and worked for him for  many years after that because he didn   t need somebody that was full-time  that needed to live on their salary like I did. He kept trying to get  me a job in Perry. (Laughs) Shirley kept saying,    She doesn   t want to  live in Perry, Oklahoma.    (Laughs)  By the time he went to work there at OSU, I had pretty much already  taken the job in Crested Butte. And that   s really where I wanted to be. I  just loved the weather in Colorado. Always did. I always thought if I  could   I was going to move to Denver, really, was my idea. I wanted to  be in Colorado, and I wanted to live in Denver. But then my friends in  Crested Butte were just,    No, you don   t. You want to come to Crested  Butte.    Well, if I could get a job. Very few year-round jobs there. There  were only 125 at the resort. Everything else was seasonal. Yes, they  were hard. I was just lucky at the time that they   d divided the sales and  marketing department up into two departments. So there was the need of  29  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  an administrative assistant in the sales department, the group sales. I got  that job, and so I was very lucky to get that. But just everything about  living there was excellent except for the money.  During those ten years, did you visit back here?  Oh, yes.  And would you visit him?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I would come back, and he came up to visit me. Yes,  he came up a couple of times, and I took him on a fishing trip. Bo  Callaway had a private fishing reserve just north of Crested Butte. It was  a beautiful place. I took them up there fishing one time, fly fishing,  because Shirley and Henry both just loved to fly fish. I never really  learned, but we picnicked and had a great day. It was wonderful up  there. There was another time that they came up to Colorado to see me  and I took them on a trip.  Another thing, we always had this thing going. The first two summers I  was up there on the weekends, I was a wrangler taking people on horse  rides in the mountains. We had two main mountains there, the ski  mountain and then another mountain. We had trails on both mountains.  We did trail rides, and so it was the only way that I had   because I  didn   t have my own horse   to ride in the summer. And then I could  borrow one of their horses to go on trail rides and stuff because, to me,  that was all you did in the summer up there. See, I always believed, as  my dad did, that herding cattle, horseback was the way you did it.  Especially on our land because it was very hilly, lots of creeks, trees, hill  and dale. You had to be on a horse. There was no way that you could  even drive a truck. Now, in later years, Daddy would always have the  big, twice a year, bring the cows in and stuff. He would wait until I   d  come home so that I   d be on a horse and the boys would be on a horse or  Mike, my older brother. And then he could be in the truck because  he  liked that better . (Laughs)  But Henry Bellmon always said that you had to use four-wheelers. That  was his thing, so we always had this four-wheeler, horse, four-wheeler,  horse. Well, I said,    On your land that   s as flat as you can see for miles,  you can do four-wheelers.    But I have this picture of him of when we  were in the governor   s office. He did a tour of all the state parks and it  was a big thing. They had a bus and they went all these different places.  And at this one state park, he went horseback riding, so they took a  picture of him, and he framed it and gave it to me, just so that he could,     Here I am, on a horse.    (Laughs) But he never gave in. He always said  herding cattle was always easier on  wheels . The best way to do it was  30  Finchum  Sharp  on a four-wheeler. That was always kind of an ongoing thing. But,  anyway, in Colorado, that   s how I got to ride horses and stuff. Then after  that, every weekend in the summer I was doing the wrangler thing, and  so I never got to do anything. I quit so that on the weekends in the  summer I could actually go out and do stuff and go on trips, horse trips  and things like that. Then I got my own horse.  Well, with him playing practical jokes on you, did you play any on him?  He was hard to play jokes on. But he could come up with some of the  best ones. April Fool   s Day was dangerous because you never knew who  he was going to target. He would always target somebody. In  Washington, DC he had some really good ones. The people never  figured it out. And what would happen is it would start like a couple of  weeks before, this inference of what was going on, and the person that  was targeted would believe the story. And then they would just be in  agony for like two weeks, because they would believe this story was  really true. Like, one time we were going to hire this guy that this person  in our office just hated  Couldn   t believe we were going to hire him and  just went on and on and on. Well, then on April Fool   s Day, during our  staff meeting   because we had a staff meeting every day   and during  our staff meeting, then Henry Bellmon would break the news that,    No,  it was just a joke.    Everybody would laugh and this person would just  be,    What ?    (Laughs) Anyway, but he was a huge practical joker.  No, I don   t recall  playing one on him . He played a joke on Sam one  time at DHS that was just funny and Sam got really mad. He didn   t take  it as a joke, he    Anyway, what we did was April Fool   s was coming  up, and so Henry Bellmon was trying to think,    Okay, let   s do Sam,     because Sam was kind of funny. Sam would play practical jokes on  other people, but when it was on him    So what we did was, Sam left  earlier than the rest of us. We took everything out of his office. All the  pictures off the wall, we took the phone, his typewriter, everything off  his desk, out of his drawers, everything. There was nothing left. We  stored them in a closet. Then the next morning we all got there early for  him to come in. And he walked into his office, and there was nothing  there. (Laughs) I remember looking into Henry Bellmon   s office  because these offices at DHS, they were really old, but they were solid  from about here down, and then they were glass. (Gestures) So you  could see into each other   s office exactly what was going on. He just had  this smirk that he would have on his face when he was really up to  something. He was just grinning and grinning and Sam was just,    What   What   s going on?    and everything. Henry Bellmon was sitting there in  his chair, just this smirk, just giggling to himself. Sam was just,    Oh      He just got real mad that we   d even done that. So, anyway, we put all his  stuff back, but yes.  31  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  I just don   t remember playing a joke on him, because the joke was  always on somebody else. He loved calling people. In the Senate, we  were an hour later  time zone , so Oklahoma was an hour earlier. We  would get phone calls from people that were mad about something, and  they would insist   they didn   t want to talk to anybody but the senator.  They were from Oklahoma, but they just didn   t want to    They would  just get really mad.    Okay, we   ll take the message.    Well, one of the  things we did in the morning when we   d get there at seven or seven-thirty,  we would call people back  in Oklahoma , and we would catch  them in bed, and he loved it. (Laughs)    This is Henry Bellmon,    and he  would call them. He would dial the phone and call them.  So this one day, this particular guy, he called a million times. He says,     Okay, we   re going to call this guy.    I said,    Okay.    So he called this  guy and he said,    This is Henry Bellmon. I understand you want to talk  to me.    He wouldn   t believe him. He said,    No, really.    How could you  not know his voice? But,    Really, really, this is Henry Bellmon.    And I  was sitting on the other side of the desk so all I heard was,    No, this is  Henry Bellmon. This really is Henry Bellmon. No, this is really Henry  Bellmon.    And then he just goes,    click.    And I said,    What was that?     He said,    He never believed me. He never believed it was me.    He said,     So when he calls back, just tell him he had his opportunity and he  missed it.    So we did, and he couldn   t believe that he was really  talking  to him . Anyway. He loved doing that. We had two people that we had  permission to hang up on. They were so nasty. (Laughs) So, yes, he was  great. He was just the best. You just wanted to do stuff for him all the  time. He   d work you hard. I mean, you were there day and night, but  nobody cared because we were doing what he wanted done, and we  knew we had to be there in order to get it done.  Which did you like better, working in the DC office or working in the   Oklahoma  capitol with him?  DC, absolutely DC.  More excitement or just all around   ?  Different people. I have to say, it   s the mentality of the people. The  Oklahoma legislature, some of those guys, they just don   t get it. Some of  those guys that we had to deal with   and Henry Bellmon, no matter who  it was, if they were a legislator, he would see them. Now, a lot of  governors aren   t like that, but he had an open-door policy with them. No  matter who they were, what side of the aisle they were on, or what they  wanted, if they wanted to see him, even if they just dropped by and he  had fifteen other things on his schedule, he would stop what he was  32  Finchum  Sharp  doing and see them. Claudia and I would just go crazy about that  because it would disrupt everything, because his schedule was just back  to back a lot of times. But he would see these guys, and these guys  would come in and yell and scream about stuff. And a lot of it would  involve that they wouldn   t be getting some little something for their  town or something like that. They were so narrow-minded about things.  Melvin Porter, Henry Bellmon was always really, really nice to Melvin  Porter, but Melvin Porter used to say stuff. He would say stuff, and the  news would print it, about Henry Bellmon. And, see, the thing about him  is   and he would tell us this      You   ve just got to let that fall off, just  like water off a duck. It   s not personal so don   t take it personal.    But it  was hard for us not to take things personal that were said about him. I   ll  never forget, one day we went to lunch at the Faculty House down there  on Lincoln. We went there quite a bit for lunch. We walked in and who  was in line but Melvin Porter. So Henry Bellmon walked up to him and  said,    Hey Melvin, nice to see you,     and held out his hand . And  Melvin Porter   it was after some particular thing that Henry Bellmon  had made Melvin mad. I can   t even remember what the issue was, but he  stood there  with his hand out , and Melvin Porter just  stood there . He  wasn   t even going to look at him. He wouldn   t offer his hand at all, so  Henry Bellmon stood there and said,    Melvin       I mean, just literally,  stood there  Finally, Melvin Porter turned around and shook his hand,     Henry.    But I mean, that   s what he did. He was just totally un-intimidated.  And the fact that somebody said, the day before, these  horrible lies, nasty things about him, didn   t matter. It   s not personal. But  gosh, the rest of us were just,    Ahh     (Laughs) But yes, that   s the way  he was.  The lessons he taught and practiced.  That was it. You were so young in DC, we were, we all were, that we  just learned so much from him. He was the true teacher of how to be and  how to act and how to treat people. The way people treat people  sometimes is just terrible. No matter who it was, he was amazing at  remembering people   s names, amazing. I was picking him up from the  airport one time. I think this was when I was in Tulsa. I went to Tulsa  for a very short time when I was in DC. I   d gotten really burned out up  there in DC, and there was an opportunity to go to our Tulsa office with  Linda Sponsler, who was a good friend. They needed a receptionist, so I  went down there. I moved back to Tulsa, and this was the year before  our last year up there. And when he   d come into town, I   d go pick him  up and do stuff like that.  I think it was there that I was picking him up from the airport, and he  was coming back from New York and he had all this stuff. I was helping  33  Finchum  Sharp  him with the stuff, and he was coming through. And there was this little  lady, when I was standing there waiting, this little older lady   probably  my age now. (Laughs) No, she was like probably in her eighties,  standing across, and she saw him. I could tell that she saw him, and she  was standing over there really demure against the wall. She was just  looking at him and looking at him. So I helped him with his stuff, and  we were walking down and he looks over and he sees this woman, and  he walks over to her and he goes,    Mrs.      whoever she was      How are  you? I   ll never forget the tea party you had at your house.    During the  first governor   s race, different people had receptions in these little small  towns for him when he came through town. She was one of them from  some little town. And he remembered her name, and I mean her face lit  up. I couldn   t believe it. He just visited with her for a while and, oh, she  was just so excited. That was pretty cool.  He was a master at remembering people   s names. Now, we always had a  staff member with him. A lot of officials kind of make that mistake, I  think. We always had a staff person with him. There were so many  people, press people and other company people, that knew who he was,  but he wouldn   t necessarily know who they were. It was kind of part of  our jobs to make sure that he knew who he was talking to type thing,  plus get him away from somebody taking up all his time. We were the  bad guy.    Sorry, but he needs to leave,    or whatever. We always did  that. I always loved that because it meant traveling with him, which I  did. When he went to DC, I was usually the one that went with him on  different things. Or traveling around the state, I got to go a lot of times. I  always enjoyed that, going to the governor   s conferences and things like  that.  Any interesting road stories?  We had a few road stories. (Laughter) It was fun. When we first became  governor, he took several of the staff to the first National Governors   Association  Conference in DC. That was a lot of fun. We really  enjoyed it. But after that, Claudia was the one that pretty much would go  with him, and Sam, our PR guy, would be the ones to go to the National  Governors  Association  Conference. Sam would go to all the  governors    conferences. But then I would go to the Southern Governors     conferences. And I really loved the Southern Governors    because it  would be in a different state all the time. And one governors    conference  we were going to was in Kentucky and, of course, you know me and  horses. He knew how crazy I was about horses. Also, he was wanting to  stop in Arkansas and meet with Sam Walton because he helped Sam  Walton  supplying his stores . He helped small businesses in Oklahoma  sell to Wal-Mart. It was a  great  thing. He and Sam Walton hunted  together. They were pretty good friends.  34  Finchum  Sharp  So, anyway, he wanted to stop in Bentonville on the way, because we  had that plane. It was a two-prop   it took a long time to get to DC.  (Laughs) Anyway, it was a pretty old plane   King Air. So we were  going to stop in Bentonville on the way to the Kentucky Governors     Conference. But Sam Walton could only see us on this certain day,  which meant we were going to have leave a day and a half before the  conference even started in Kentucky. That was okay, we were going to  go anyway. We   d just be there early. So he called the governor of  Kentucky and said,    We   re coming in a couple of days early. I have my  secretary here who is horse crazy. Do you have some recommendations?  Maybe see a farm, like a horse farm or something?    So she set up a tour  of Calumet Farms for us, and that   s where Alydar stood as stud, and  other famous race horses. So she set that up and I was so excited  That  was just big.  So we did. We stopped in Bentonville and saw Sam Walton, and we all  went down with him to open a store in Springfield, Arkansas, and saw  him in action, opening a store. He was the nicest, nicest man, absolutely.  Then we went on to Kentucky, and we went on that tour. And Henry  Bellmon, he   s not a big horse fan or anything, but he went on that tour  and we toured and we just had a great time. That was a lot of fun. That  was really nice, too, because of all the things you could do there, he  picked, again, for me, that we would go to a horse farm.  Those governors    conferences were a lot of fun. I got to meet a lot of  people on the other governors    staffs. And being a governor   s secretary,  too, there was an organization that was governors    secretaries. We had a  get-together every year, too, in a different place, and we would get to  tour the different governors    mansions and the capitols. And they would  take us out and wine and dine us, and we   d have a real good friend in  their state and everything. We hosted it one year, and it was real fun. I  got to do that for four years. That was really fun.  Some perks after long hours of work.  Yes, yes. That was nice to get to do things like that. He went to the  conferences for the business, and that was what it was all about for him.  Oh, I will tell you one other story, and it was at Sea Island. There was a  last minute thing. I was doing statements for him and different things  like that, so we   d all been dismissed. We were going to have a free  afternoon. I had signed up for horseback riding on the beach. I   d always  wanted to do that, and I   d never done that, so that   s what I was going to  do this afternoon. Just before they adjourned, Henry Bellmon and two or  three other senators decided they wanted to put together this plan. So I  was going to have to go work on the plan. (Laughs)  35  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  He came over and he said,    So we   re going to do this plan. Did you have  anything planned?    And I almost didn   t say anything, but he would have  killed me if he thought that I had a plan and didn   t tell him. So I told him  that I signed up to go horseback riding on the beach and I said,    But  that   s okay. No problem. I   ll cancel it.    And again, he was just,    No, you  won   t. You go ahead. How long is it going to take?    It was like an hour  and a half ride and he said,    Okay, so we   ll meet back here at such and  such time. That will give you time to take a shower and do whatever and  meet back here, and then we   ll meet there.    He told the other senators,  he said,    This time, we   ll meet back here at this room and we   ll work  out this plan.    And so we did. He let me go horseback riding on the  beach, which was oh, so much fun  (Laughs) It was great, really  awesome. So, yes, he   s     He   s a special guy, all the way around.  All the way around. Special, absolutely special. I just can   t think of  another person, other than my family. My dad, my dad was just my hero.  But Henry Bellmon was my hero, too. He was probably as close to the  way I respected and loved my dad. Henry Bellmon was that close. I  think it was because I knew him from childhood, basically, and then  going to work with him was kind of a no-brainer, really, because I  already kind of had the loyalty and knew what kind of person he was. I  knew that he was a great man and he was a big guy. (Laughs) But very  soft, such a good heart.  That might be a good place to stop, huh?  Yes. (Laughs) Before I start crying again, yes. (Laughs)  Any Shirley stories?  Oh, Shirley.  Let   s do a Shirley story.  Shirley Bellmon was the best. I   ll never forget, when we went on this  tour to Europe, of course, she made almost all her own clothes. It was  amazing to me how she could sew. I could sew anything. She got really  mad at me one time because I started to make a tennis dress, which is  basically pretty simple, and I worked on it for weeks and weeks and  weeks. And I finally just threw it away because I couldn   t get it to work.  (Laughs) I told her about it at some point and she   s just,    Sharon, don   t  you ever do that because you just bring it to me and I will fix it  I will  make it work     But we were on the plane and she was finishing some of  36  Finchum  Sharp  her suits, and she was just sewing away. (Laughs) Shirley was the best.  She was just real down to earth. She just loved everybody. She was so  good. She was just so good to everybody. Anything you needed, just  always there for you. I mean, if you needed anything or you were having  a problem or something, she   d want you to come tell her because she not  only was like a mother but a friend.  She loved cooking for us all, and she got involved in a lot of things up  there. The Red Cross, she got involved with. She was renovating some  houses, doing that, she was very involved in that, decorating and  everything. One of the funniest things about Shirley was that she hated it  that in the US Capitol, there are all these tulips that are planted. And  when spring is over and the tulips are done, the bulbs (before she got  there) were all dug up and thrown away. Well, she thought that was a  tremendous waste of flowers. She would get the Capitol gardeners to put  these tulip bulbs in huge gunny sacks and bring them down and put them  in the middle of the underground parking lot at the US Senate Building.  And then the boys  on our staff  had to go and divide them. She would  tell all the Senate wives and the wives would come and get these tulips  and take them home and plant them. The  boys  hated it  Every year  they were,    Tulip time     Oh, my gosh  (Laughs) And Shirley would be  like,    Okay, it   s tulip time     And the boys were    Oh, no,    because they  would have to go and put them in sacks and do all this. It was just funny.  The girls didn   t have to do that. Just the boys, you know. Every year it  was the same thing.  That was funny. She just couldn   t see things going to waste. That was  just the way she was so yes, she was a great lady. We were devastated  when we lost her, and so was he. I mean, she was his strength and his  backbone. We worried about him for a long time after she was gone. But  he carried on, and we all were around him, supported him. We were  worried that some woman was going to come and take advantage of him.  (Laughs) And then he married Eloise, very sweet lady, known each other  forever. The grandsons got them together, which was cute. That   s  probably the best story, the tulips. Oh, God. That was funny.  She was into beautification and landscape stuff, wasn   t she?  Absolutely. You know the wildflowers.  She loved them so she had  them planted on the highways, and they were allowed to grow. That was  huge here in Oklahoma. But, see, in the governor   s office the routine  was that I went over to the mansion every morning at seven, and we did  mail and things there at the mansion. And then we would go to the office  because the office opened at eight. So I was over there all the time.  Shirley would always give me some little something for breakfast or  something like that because I was always the early bird to get there and  37  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  everything. The funny thing is that there were two guys, two highway  patrolmen, who were with him all the time. Drove him around, and did  all that. Which, he hated being driven around, but we insisted that he  was driven around. Scott Watkins was one of them, and he now works  for Chesapeake. (Laughs) I couldn   t believe it when Scott went to work  for Chesapeake. I wrote him and said,    Are you the Scott Watkins that  we used to drive around with?    He was just,    Yes, that   s me      I mean, I used to take dictation everywhere. We   d be in the car, all kinds  of different places. He would have a letter or a reminder or a statement,  and I always had my book with me. I was always taking down in  shorthand, no matter where we were. That was fun going over there  every morning to the mansion, and then I got to know the mansion staff  pretty well. We   d go over there sometimes and just sit out by the pool  and do that. And one time   he loved crabs, and so in DC, he would  always take people out to Ernie   s Crab House. It was one of his favorite,  favorite things, and show you how to crack a crab and eat a crab and do  all that. Then we would go across the street and get ice cream at Baskin-  Robbins, because ice cream was his weakness. He loved ice cream.  We   d always have to go over to the Senate Dining Room and get ice  cream sundaes. You couldn   t refuse. You had to go. (Laughs) Cathy  Buchanan had problems, stomach problems, with ice cream. But she  would go, and she would eat her ice cream just for Henry Bellmon.  (Laughter) It was pretty funny.  But yes, he was a man of many tastes and always trying new stuff.  You   d think being where he was from and everything, he   d be a steak  and potatoes guy, but that   s not true. He loved all kinds of different stuff  and trying new things all the time. He   d always try to get you to try new  stuff, too, even if it looked strange. He was always trying stuff, new. He  was always for that. He wasn   t a stuffy person. He was always up for  new  ideas . And people in the US Senate, from both sides of the aisle,  senators, they admired him. When they would vote every year in the  Washingtonian Magazine,    Who would you go to for advice?    Henry  Bellmon would always be  on the list  because they knew no matter  what the question is they   re going to get an honest answer from this guy.  He was a farmer, he wasn   t a lawyer. He was really of the minority there  in the US Senate. He got along with everybody.  He was a good statesman and had integrity and all of that     Yes, totally.  Total package.  Total statesman. We don   t have those anymore. But he was every sense  38  Finchum  Sharp  Finchum  Sharp  of the word, a statesman, integrity. People knew they would get an  honest answer from him. Not on the fence, not hem and haw around, but  true answer. He made good decisions, and he was that much respected  on both sides of the aisle. You can   t say that a lot about a lot of people  anymore.  So no regrets from saying yes to the first job offer?  The first job offer, I should   ve gone. When they asked me the first time,  I should   ve gone, but definitely happy I went the second time. Yes, I  can   t imagine what my life would   ve been like without that experience.  I   ve just done a lot of different things. Even just while I worked for  Henry Bellmon, I was pretty much his personal assistant the whole time,  but just in all those different situations and all those different jobs     governor, senator, and state agency   and large state agency, at that. So,  yes, it   s been a great, great experience working with him. I don   t know  what my life would have been without     I can   t even imagine it. It  would have been completely different.  I think it   s time to sign off, don   t you? Thank you very much. It   s been a  pleasure.  Yes. (Laughs) Thank you. I appreciate being able to tell stories about  him.  -------  -------
