 Little Thunder This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, September 29, 2015.  I   m interviewing Karin Walkingstick for the Oklahoma Native Artist project,  sponsored by Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University. We are at Karin   s home in Claremore,  Oklahoma . Karin, you  are Cherokee. You have only been showing two years, but your hand-built  pots have won several awards at major shows. You use some traditional  formats, but you   ve also been etching figurative designs into your pottery  and painting them and painting those pots in ways that are new, so I look  forward to hearing more about your work. Thank you for taking the time to  talk with me. Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Walkingstick I was born in Claremore, Oklahoma, at the Claremore Indian Hospital and I  grew up here. Still live here.  Little Thunder What did your folks do for a living?  Walkingstick My dad was a machinist. He worked at, he retired from American Airlines  in Tulsa.  Little Thunder Okay. How about your mom?  Walkingstick My mom, she lives in Claremore. She   s not working. She doesn   t work.  Little Thunder Did you have any brothers or sisters?  Walkingstick I do. I have one brother. He   s five years younger than me. His name is  Michael Walkingstick and he lives in Kansas.  Little Thunder What was your relationships with your grandparents on either side?  Walkingstick My grandparents? I never had a grandpa. My grandpas were all gone before  I was old enough to remember them. My dad, his mother, I got to know her.  5  She was born in February of 1900. That was Cora May Walkingstick and I  got to know her. We had a big family and it was always hard getting time  with grandma, but any time with grandma was really special. I remember  laying my head in her lap and her speaking Cherokee to me. I really enjoyed  the time with my grandma.  Little Thunder Yes, I was going to ask if you were around the language very much growing  up?  Walkingstick Just with my grandma and she didn   t speak with the family for just everyday  things. So it was kind of neat when I had my head laid in her lap and then  she would speak Cherokee to me because she wouldn   t do it very often.  Little Thunder Did you have any extended family members who were artists?  Walkingstick You know, on my   my families are so big, there could be. (Laughter) On  my mom   s side, she has several sisters that do draw and paint and are pretty  talented that way. On my dad   s side, I have the distant relative, Kay  Walkingstick, who we all know she is a painter and doing very well, but I   ve  never met her. She   s a distant relative, but I like to claim her.  Little Thunder Sure. Is the Cherokee on your dad   s side and your mom   s side?  Walkingstick No, just my dad.  Little Thunder What was your first experience with Native art?  Walkingstick Two years ago. It   s been really new to me. I didn   t grow up around Stillwell   Oklahoma . My dad   s from Stillwell. Most of these people live in and  around Tahlequah, and it   s only an hour from here, so it   s not hard to get to.  But when I started doing this pottery, I had taken a class with Jane Osti. A  friend had suggested that might be kind of fun. We went and took the class  and had a ball and loved Jane. From the minute I had my hands in the clay, I  was looking around, trying to figure out       This is really fun. How can I do  more of this?    Then I started trying to figure out how I could do more of it. I  took some clay home and I practiced a lot at home. And I   d visit a lot with  Jane and take another class. Jane was very good at guiding me through this  and getting me started.  Little Thunder What was your first memory of actually doing art as a child?  Walkingstick I can   t ever remember not doing it. I always had big Chief tablet and my  pencils, and crayons   crayons were the best thing, crayons and markers.  You could make whatever you want or draw whatever you want. I was  allowed to sit on the school bus in kindergarten with the big kids that sat in  the back of the bus because I would draw them whatever they would want  6  me to draw. So they kind of looked out after me. I always had older  friends     Little Thunder You were getting commissions young.  Walkingstick Because of that, it started early, yeah. Yeah. Kindergarten art contest, I won  the kindergarten art contest. It was just that way. I remember winning in first  grade and second grade, and through high school. They still had them.  Little Thunder Were you working at all in three dimensional  art  at that point?  Walkingstick You did lots of arts and crafts, yes. I   ve played with clay before, mostly the  kind you cook in your oven, just to do kids    crafts with nieces and nephews.  I   m always the one that they come to,    Let   s go play art at Aunt Karin   s.     Little Thunder Even in high school, you were pretty serious about your art?  Walkingstick We didn   t have   we had art class, but I didn   t do a lot outside of that. Just  at school. I kind of laid it aside for a long time, living life, twenties, thirties.  Making quilts, still staying busy, but always doing something creative  somewhere. It   s just an outlet that relaxes me. It makes me feel good. Until I  started the pottery. Now I   m all the time doing the pottery.  Little Thunder What did you do after you graduated from high school?  Walkingstick Worked like everyone else. I got married kind of young and had my son,  Cody. He lives here in Claremore. He   s twenty-four now and doing his own  thing, so it   s time for me to do my own thing.  Little Thunder You stayed at home with him for a couple years?  Walkingstick Yeah. I worked when he was growing up, but we   ve lived here for ten years,  almost eleven years. I have not worked while we have been here. I used to  keep my house really clean, but now I have clay dust everywhere.  Little Thunder It   s a beautiful place.  Walkingstick Thank you.  Little Thunder So you kind of explained that you started, you saw this pottery class. You  took one from Jane, and then you went back and took a few more. What did  you learn under her?  Walkingstick I can   t even   I just learned so much from Jane. Jane was, she is an  inspiration. If you know her, you know what it is to love Jane Osti. She   s  just so sweet and so giving. She is not one to keep it to herself. She is all  7  about sharing the culture and what she knows. She   s proud of it and she   s  willing to share it with you. I got to go on a two week trip with Jane to  Maryland, the summer before last. We went up and taught a class at  McDaniel College for Common Ground on the Hill  Music and Arts  Festival . We stopped back through Cherokee, North Carolina, and went  through their archives at their museum and got to see some of the old  pottery. It was really neat. Telling them what you want to bring out and  they   ll bring it and you can see it up close and personal and take pictures  and see, really, how they made their pottery.  I don   t do traditional pottery. I don   t like going home the same way twice. I  like to do different things. Contemporary fits well with me. I like the idea  that I can do anything that I want, I don   t have to stay in any certain vein. I  am Cherokee, and that makes it Cherokee pottery. Other than that, it   s  contemporary pottery. I use commercial clay and I fire in a kiln. So far that  has been working for me and allowed me to jump right in, and not have to  stop and process the clay. I know that   s part of it. I have processed the clay,  Native clay, and have yet to do a pit fire, but that   s on the list to do. I think  you should know how. But I don   t know that I would really change from  what I am doing right now, as far as how I make what I use, but I do like to  experiment with it.  Little Thunder Did it change anything for you, that personal encounter with those older  pots?  Walkingstick Yes, I wish so bad you could snap your fingers and go back for even a day  and just see how they lived, and how they used these things. They were  utilitarian. They weren   t something you set on the shelf and looked at. They  were useful items. They were very central to getting through your day. You  had your meal. I would really   I know you can   t do that, but how neat  would that be? (Laughs)  Little Thunder Now, when you were working with Jane, was she firing pieces in a kiln for  the class? Is that how that worked?  Walkingstick Yeah, we were using the Cherokee Art Center in Tahlequah. They have two  big kilns there and it   s for us to use, so we did. I started taking the classes,  and then I started helping her with the classes just a little bit. She let me  apprentice with her for a little while, and help go set up the classes. See  what she does in teaching each class, how she handles it and what she says  to them and different designs that she would have us do. Explaining the  paddle stamping from how they used to do it. Some still do. I would like to  learn more about the histories. The history behind some of the pots that we  have. We   ll ask each other, the artists will get together and say,    Is this  water or wind?    We   re still undecided on some of the designs, but  8  somebody   s got to know somewhere, right? We   ll find out. It just takes  time.  Little Thunder It was a good way to learn, basically, by apprenticing and how to run the  class?  Walkingstick Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Little Thunder When did you enter your first art competition and what was your piece?  Walkingstick First art competition was the Trail of Tears show, not this past year, but the  year before. I was lucky enough to walk away with a ribbon for pottery. I  believe it was Third Place and the People   s Choice award. I won that and the  Emerging Artist of the Year, so it was a big first show for me.  Little Thunder That   s great. Now, were you set up to do your   did you have your own kiln  at that point?  Walkingstick No, I didn   t. I was buying my clay through the art center in Tahlequah and  using their kilns. I live an hour away, so it was four hours on the road every  time I wanted to fire something. That was my first goal, was I would go to  the shows, and I would sell what I could sell and people were buying this. I  opened my own account, and I saved my money, and the first summer in  July, Christmas in July, I got my own kiln. Paid for my pottery, paid for my  kiln. It   s been paying for itself. It   s been doing its own   it   s been a good  trip.  Little Thunder How did you know how to price your work at first?  Walkingstick Pricing is kind of difficult. You kind of take   you look at pottery around  you, and what pottery, what pottery there is out there. I look at Jane   s  pottery. Jane   s is quite a bit higher than mine. She   s been around for a long  time, she knows what she is doing, she   s well established. That   s what you  get when you get Jane   s work, rightfully. It should be, but mine   s going to  be lower than that. Pricing is kind of difficult. It   s your time, it   s how much  you   ve put into the design. Easier pots are not as much. I   ve had pieces from  a  100 to  3500, and I   ve done well, all in between that. So far, it   s really  good. I think I   m sitting pretty close to where I should be right now.  Little Thunder What is your husband   s role in the business?  Walkingstick I couldn   t do this without him. I just couldn   t. He   s such a big support. He  likes to laugh about it and say that he carries everything. Well, he does. He  also helps me with my website and the business side of things, expenses,  and logging everything, and making sure you got your i   s dotted and your t   s  crossed. And tries to stay on me about making my deadlines, because I   m  9  not real good at that. Not really organized. He tries to keep me organized, I  guess.  Little Thunder What are some of your pottery influences?  Walkingstick Pottery influences?  Little Thunder Since it   s contemporary and you are not necessarily   Southeastern is one,  but are there other influences on your pottery?  Walkingstick The people that I meet, who I learn from. I think we   re all a little piece of  who we learn from. Not only did I spend time with Jane, I got to spend some  time with Richard Zane Smith.  Little Thunder Let   s hear about that.  Walkingstick Wonderful guy. Him and his wife are just great. I got to spend a week with  him last year, just me and him in his studio building, across from each other.  I wouldn   t trade that for anything. He   s a big experimenter. When I first  started this, I thought I would stay in the Cherokee vein and make traditional  pottery. Why wouldn   t you? But then you make a few pieces, and for me, I  don   t want to go home the same way. I don   t want to make the same pot  over and over again. Richard is a big experimenter. I like that. I like that  there is so much to learn. Every piece is a learning experience. He has taught  me how to make a corrugated coil pot. I don   t have any to show you. I can   t  seem to keep them. It   s just a different way of making things and a different  way of learning things when you learn from different things. I appreciate  what Richard has had to teach me about painting the pottery. Now I paint  pottery. Cherokees didn   t paint their pottery  elaborately .  Little Thunder Can you talk a little bit about your figurative work on pots like Birds on a  Wire or Birds of a Feather?  Walkingstick Birds on a Wire is pretty easy. It   s the biggest pot I have ever made. I  wrestled with it for a while. Of course, it took more time than any of the  other pots, and by the time I was finished with it, I just wanted to have some  fun with it. My husband and his mother, their family are birders. It just  seemed appropriate. I was talking to her, and I told her I wanted to put birds  on the pot, and I said,    What are some small birds?    She is telling me about  some small birds that would fit on the pot. I kind of looked those up to see  what the shapes were and     Little Thunder Are they blackbirds?  Walkingstick They are not all blackbirds. They are in color. They   re in color and they   re  black. It   s supposed to be just a shadow of them, their profiles. I did carve a  10  little bit into them, so you can see. There   s a titmouse. There   s a red bird, or  a cardinal. Some of the other birds are on the edge. They   re all just goofing  and having a good time. There is one bird hanging upside down. Some days,  that   s us.  Little Thunder You can really see your background in painting and drawing. What kind of  paint did you use for the art?  Walkingstick It   s a slip. A slip with a mason-stain color for the color mixed with slip and  then painted on.  Little Thunder Right. Do you always title your pots?  Walkingstick I do for my competition pieces. I don   t always title a pot. Naming them is a  whole job in itself. It   s easy for some people, I guess. Birds on a Wire is all I  could think of with the birds sitting on a wire. It   s not very creative. There is  another gentleman I know that does such a wonderful job at naming pots. He  popped off with The Party Line. The Party Line  (Laughter) I wished I had  thought of it myself.  Little Thunder How about Birds of a Feather? That   s actually painted. There doesn   t seem  to be much etching, I don   t think.  Walkingstick That one is all incised. There isn   t paint on that one. There are different  birds all around the pot. It   s a Oklahoma birds on a pond scene and they go  all around the pot. Great blue herons, two of those. Ruddy duck, a wood  duck, just common ducks. Not sure if they have a name, just different birds.  There   s a frog in there.  Little Thunder Now I remember. There was cattails. There was a landscape.  Walkingstick Yes.  Little Thunder How about that one that looked like it was painted on your website. It had  butterflies.  Walkingstick I   ve done a butterfly one. It was called Monarchs in the Milkweeds, and that  was to draw attention to the milkweed plant that the monarchs depend so  much on. You hear a lot about people planting milkweed plants to get the  monarchs here and get them some food.  Little Thunder And that was painted with some slips as well?  Walkingstick It was, it was. That one was in the Sherwin Miller Jewish Museum in Tulsa.  That   s the first place it came out at. I didn   t have it very long. I came back  and made a hummingbird pot along the same lines.  11  Little Thunder What   s the biggest challenge you   ve encountered in your work so far?  Walkingstick The histories, probably that. Nobody likes to sound silly when they ask you  about something that you don   t quite know the answer to. It makes you think  maybe you shouldn   t be making it yet. I have had a little bit of that. There is  a pot that we   ve made, it was from an old Creek site. It was a Creek pot. I  didn   t realize at first that it was a Creek pot, so now I know. Same thing, I  had made a Caddo pot. It   s the same thing. I liked the shape. It was all in  innocence. It wasn   t, you know, stealing anything. It was all in building the  shapes. I was learning the different shapes and I liked the shape of those  pots. I made them. Now, I know there is a line, a line of respect. You try not  to cross that line.  I think just about anything else, it   s mine. It   s mine. I   m not copying off  anything, I   m not looking at anything. I   m making it up as I go. These pots  sometime tell me what they are going to be. I   ve had them change shape.  One pot changed shape four different times. It comes out the way it wants to  be. It doesn   t always go the way I want it to. I   m always happy in the end.  I   ve thought about that before.    How do you know?      someone had asked  me      How do you know when you are finished?    That   s a hard question to  answer. I don   t know if you   re tired of working on it or if you   re just  satisfied, if you   re to the point that you are just satisfied with it. It feels  good. You can let it go into the world and be happy about it.  Little Thunder What is the best piece of business advice you have gotten?  Walkingstick    Always smile, and always be nice to everyone,    I think. I have sold pots  that way, just visiting with people, not expecting a sale. Just visiting with  someone and having a good conversation. I can think of a time in Lawrence,  Kansas, where I was talking to this lady for a long time, and it was kind of  slow at the show. We had the best conversation.  She said it was time to go and she left. She came back two hours later and  bought the pot that she was rubbing on when she   it was highly incised, and  it felt good to rub it. The whole time we were talking, she was rubbing, I  think we were both rubbing that pot. It just felt good to touch it. She came  back and she missed touching that pot, and she had to come take it home  with her. That turned into something. We were just visiting, you know. I  wasn   t trying to make a sale. If someone doesn   t want it, they don   t want it.  Just stop by and say hi. Just enjoy your day. If it makes you happy, it does.  If it doesn   t, then maybe the next one will.  Little Thunder Thanks for sharing that. What   s an award that you have gotten so far that  you are particularly proud of?  Walkingstick Santa Fe. (Laughs)  12  Little Thunder Tell us about that.  Walkingstick Santa Fe Indian Art Market. It was my first year out there this year. It was  last month. I got an Honorable Mention, my first time out. Shocked,  couldn   t believe it. Excited.  Little Thunder In the Contemporary Pottery category? Now was it at IFAM  The  Indigenous Fine Art Movement  or was it at the Market?  Walkingstick It was at the big market.  Little Thunder Okay.  Walkingstick The smaller one doesn   t have the awards.  Little Thunder Doesn   t have the competition?  Walkingstick No, not yet. The big show, that   s a special one. It looks white, but it  the  ribbon  feels blue. It was a big award for me. Also, Red Earth. Red Earth  was a big one. The Kathleen Everett Upshaw Award, that was a big one for  me.  Little Thunder You might explain what that award was for.  Walkingstick I don   t know if I can. I don   t know if I can without getting it wrong. I don   t  want to misspeak, but it was a member of her family that set it up. She was  big into the art. It was just a foundation made for her. I   m not sure how to  explain that one. I don   t want to mess that one up. Also, the first show that I  was ever in. That was the first, you know. There was three there. I  appreciate every time, I don   t ever expect it. It   s always a shock when they  call your name. It   s not my favorite thing to do, go to the front of the class  when they call your name, but you know...  Little Thunder What was it like being at  Indian  Market for the first time?  Walkingstick That was exciting, to be out setting up your booth at four thirty in the  morning in the dark, and finding your way to your booth in the first place.  Like I said, I had never been there, setting up, at four thirty in the morning,  and getting ready, and thinking,    People are going to show up.    It was very  busy. The whole weekend. I had so many great conversations, and met so  many neat people. Great contacts, and friends I think that I will have for a  long time. I really enjoyed that show.  Little Thunder It   s kind of amazing how many Cherokee potters have started their careers  in midlife or later?  13  Walkingstick Yes.  Little Thunder I think Anna Mitchell, and her daughter Victoria. Jane  Osti , Crystal  Hannah. I mean, there are just lots of examples. Do you have any thoughts  about that?  Walkingstick I think it   s pretty neat. I didn   t know about Crystal Hannah, I didn   t know  what age she was when she started, but I knew that Annabelle was forty  something, and Jane, also. Me too. It lets me know that it   s not too late.  They have done very well, had long careers, and still going. I don   t see an  end to it. I don   t think Jane sees an end to it. She is happy doing what she is  doing. It   s a good example to have in front of you.  Little Thunder You live out in the country. Is that an inspiration for your work?  Walkingstick Oh, nature, always. Yes, yes. As far as what goes on my pots, it   s all nature.  I   ve done deer and birds, and bears, and you know, bears in my backyard,  but it   s all nature. I use things, too. I use natural things as tools like walnuts  and peach pits and corn. I use all of those in     Little Thunder For patterning?  Walkingstick Yeah, texture.  Little Thunder Do you make any functional pots?  Walkingstick I don   t. You have to seal the pot, and I don   t use glazes. I think a glaze  would   I haven   t got into glazes. I think a glaze would seal it. I don   t use  them. They   re all just decorative.  Little Thunder Have you done any out-of-state shows? You mentioned workshops.  Walkingstick Out of state? Yeah, I just came back from Haskell, in Kansas, Lawrence,  Kansas. That was a good show for me. It was a good show for me last year,  too. Santa Fe, New Mexico. The rest, I think, are mostly around here. They  are in Oklahoma. Tahlequah, in Oklahoma. Cherokee Art Market, about  twenty minutes away from me. Not a lot out of state yet. Oh, I did Eiteljorg,  Eiteljorg in Indiana.  Little Thunder Okay. How long have you done that one?  Walkingstick It was just this year.  Little Thunder This year. How did that go?  14  Walkingstick It was a good show. It was different to the aspect that it drew a different  crowd, northern crowd. It was a different crowd. It was a good show.  Little Thunder Did you get to look around Indiana at all?  Walkingstick No, we usually go up there for the show and then spend the whole time  doing things associated with the show and then home. There is no place like  home.  Little Thunder You   re getting ready to do Cherokee Art Market and you have your  competition piece finished.  Walkingstick I do, I do. I usually can   t say that. This is a rare occasion. (Laughter)  Little Thunder You want to tell us about that? This won   t come out for six months.  (Laughter)  Walkingstick It   s a rare occasion that I have one finished this soon before the show. It  happened. I   m glad it happened. I have it, I   m ready. I can relax. I wish it  happened that way every time.  Little Thunder You have enough inventory, you think?  Walkingstick I do. I like to go with a lot, I think, more than most. I like to go with a  variety because if there   s something you don   t see over here, maybe you   ll  see it on the other table. I try to keep a big variety, whether they   re painted  or corrugated or look more Cherokee. Just a little bit of something for  everybody. I   m happy when I have a variety, so I try to take a variety. My  inventory   s down a little bit right now. But working hard to build it back up,  keep it up.  Little Thunder What is your favorite thing to make? I know that you don   t like to repeat,  necessarily. What is your favorite pot to make right now?  Walkingstick Turtles.  Little Thunder Turtles?  Walkingstick I do like to make the turtles because you can make them so different. Yeah,  the turtle, the effigy pots. My turtles are different from anybody else   s  turtles. I wish I had a picture to show you. I don   t have any turtles right now.  Little Thunder I saw one in two different slips, I think, two different     Walkingstick There was a black one that was done with a sgraffito finish. I sold that this  last show. I hated to see him go. It   s surprising how you get attached to them  15  like they   re almost animals or something. I get attached to the turtles, I don   t  know why. The turtles are fun to make, because you can make them so  many different ways and finish them off. One finish I like to do is a pine  needle fire, a flash fire. You take your pottery out and make a little nest of  pine needles, put your pottery in it, cover it up with pine needles, and light it  on fire. You never know what you are going to get. It   s like Christmas  morning. Sometimes the result is really, really good and it   s really thrilling  when that happens. On a slightly breezy day, you can get some really good  flame licks on your pottery. I like to finish the turtles that way sometimes.  Little Thunder Only turtles? You haven   t done your pots     Walkingstick I do a lot of pots that way.  Little Thunder Oh, you do?  Walkingstick I do most of my pots that way. It has them ask questions when they walk up.  They want to know,    Is it wood?    Now I   m getting a lot,    Is it leather?    I  can see where they would say that.  Little Thunder Because there   s some nice brown tones in there.  Walkingstick Yeah, there is really some nice brown tones in there.  Little Thunder So you do both the kiln and the wood firing, or the pine needle firing, at  least?  Walkingstick Uh-huh, for the finish at the end. Because the clay that I use, it is a  commercial clay. It   s very orangey. Some of them I   ll leave that way if I  paint on them, but if I don   t have any painting on it, they usually go in the  pine needle fire, pine and cedar, but a combination, yeah.  Little Thunder I don   t think you were working when the drought was so bad, but have there  been days when you couldn   t do that?  Walkingstick Lots of days. Lots of days of the drought situation. Also, we get a lot of  wind. I do have a wind barrier set up for where I do mine but still on some  days, it   s a little breezy to be out messing around with it. I   m not a fire bug.  I don   t like the fire to get out of control. I don   t want that to happen. If it   s a  pretty breezy I won   t go out and try it, but a slightly breezy day will get you  some good color.  Little Thunder Do you have any projects coming up that you   re particularly excited about?  Walkingstick I do. I   m with the Return From Exile exhibit that   s going around the  country. It opened in Athens, Georgia, and it   ll be making its way around for  16  the next two years. I have a piece in that. I   m doing the Cherokee Art  Market and I   m going to have a little gallery show with Tim Nevaquaya out  by the river in Tulsa. So I   ve got that to look forward to, and my next show,  SEASAM, Southeastern Art Show and Market, with the Chickasaw Nation  in Tishomingo is up next.  Little Thunder You   re continuing to sell from the Spider Gallery, I guess?  Walkingstick Yeah. The Spider Gallery. Poor Spider Gallery, they don   t have anything  right now because I robbed it all for Santa Fe. I need to replenish them, but  yeah, I enjoy the Spider Gallery. There are some other gallery opportunities  that I think are coming up as soon as I can build my inventory up a little bit.  I   ve got, not mentioned yet, but yeah there are some gallery shows coming  up that I don   t think I should mention yet.  Little Thunder That could work out really nicely.  Walkingstick I hope so. I hope so.  Little Thunder Do you get a lot of commissions?  Walkingstick I do. Commissions, I think, everybody from what I hear, they all feel kind of  the same way about the commissions. They   re nice to have. They   re steady  income, but the thing about commissions is that you   re making something  that somebody else wants. You   re not making something that comes strictly  from you, that   s what you feel like making. You   re making something for  someone else. I   ve done good with them so far, the commissions. I   ve been  happy with what has come out of it, but it   s never the favorite. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Let   s talk a little bit more about your techniques. You   re building. Are you  using the coil method on your pots or     Walkingstick Yes, I   ve never used a wheel. I   ve always done coils, corrugated coils, the  bigger Cherokee coil, the way we do it, Cherokee. Like I said, I have never  used the wheel. I get that a lot. People will ask,    How do you get it so round  if it   s not on a wheel?    I don   t know, I   ve never used a wheel. We have a  turntable that we use to turn your work, turn it around where you can work  on it. It   s all hand-turned, but that helps to get it nice and round, to be able to  turn it around. It is a little bit of a struggle. I got some little tips and tricks I  like to try to keep myself in the round. (Laughter)  Little Thunder And you seem to like the pinch pot top sometimes?  Walkingstick Yeah, the notched tops.  Little Thunder The notched tops     17  Walkingstick I think it adds a nice little extra on the top. But they   re not all like that. I like  to do that, though.  Little Thunder What about burnishing?  Walkingstick I burnish with a stone. They   re all stone burnished. In the end, the more time  you spend polishing them, the better off it is in the end. When you get that  flame lick on there from the pine fire, it can make a really nice   the  smoother it is, the better it looks on the outside with the finish.  Little Thunder Do you ever feel frustrated that you can   t burnish as long as you want to?  Walkingstick I work pretty hard on them. I usually can get them done before it   s past time.  I usually start on it a little early, actually.  Little Thunder What kinds of research do you do for your pots, besides what you   ve learned  from other artists or maybe     Walkingstick Because they   re contemporary, there   s not a lot of research to it. You make  what you feel and if it feels good, go with it. I come up with some strange  things sometimes just because I wonder if that will work. I made an acorn  last year for the SEASAM show coming up. I just wanted to see if I could  make it. I had a fat little acorn that I wanted, that I had as an example. I just  wanted to see if I could make it. I did. It won first place at the SESAM show  and people were commenting. Of course, I   m new. I don   t know where  people are coming from with what they like. I just make what I like. I  pushed myself to see if I can get that cap on there and make that curve. It   s  just pushing myself, really. Not a lot of research to it.  Little Thunder It was a bigger piece?  Walkingstick Uh-huh, yeah. I really like the way it turned out. What I did before I started  making that is I looked online to see acorn pottery, pottery made in the  shape of an acorn. I didn   t see a lot. The ones I did see, were upside down. I  thought,    Why can   t you make it standing up?    I didn   t see any, so I just  tried it. It   s just a lot of experimenting.  Little Thunder The balancing of it, I guess, the shape.  Walkingstick Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like it would be really top heavy, but it came out  nice. (Laughs) A friend of mine has it in his study.  Little Thunder Great. It found a good home. How do you sign your work?  18  Walkingstick Okay, thirteen letter last name   s kind of long. So you want to make sure the  bottom is big enough where you can write your whole name out. I do write  Karin Walkingstick and I sign it with the year, and I write that it is a  Cherokee pot. I write Cherokee on it in Cherokee. On the smaller things, I  have a mark that I use for the smaller pieces that I can   t quite get it on there.  Little Thunder There   s a lot of relief work that you do as well besides etching?  Walkingstick Uh-huh.  Little Thunder Can you talk about that a little bit?  Walkingstick Okay, so only two years in, now I   m doing these faces. I   m doing this sort of  relief work. I did some dogwoods and made the pot really thick because I  knew that I really wanted to dig in deep on it and really make it stand out. It  turned out fine. It turned out really nice and I was happy with it.  Little Thunder We   ll take a look at that one pretty quickly here. What is one of the most  fruitful, either experiments or mistakes, that turned into something  constructive?  Walkingstick Oh, let   s see. Specifically, I can   t really think of anything on the spot.  Generally, I can tell you that it happens a lot where I will make something  and I don   t really like it and I won   t like it for days. Then all of a sudden,  I   ll do one little thing to it, and it just makes the biggest difference in the  whole thing. It just makes you love the pot after that. I   ve gotten into these  little things where it   s just that one little thing, all it needed was that one  little thing, and it made all the difference in the world. That   s happened to  me over and over, where I   ve not really liked it and then it has turned out  really well.  Little Thunder So you haven   t kiln-fired it yet? It   s still the clay and you will end up     Walkingstick Sometimes it   s before, sometimes it   s after. You never can tell. It   s usually  at the end. It really is. The piece that I   m going to show you is one of them. I  wasn   t really sure about it and I did that one little thing and I go,    Okay,  now I like it.     Little Thunder What is your creative process, starting with how you get your ideas?  Walkingstick Honestly, I   m usually laying in bed when I   m thinking about it. I   m usually  trying to go to sleep at night and I am thinking about it. What am I going to  make next? What can I get into next? I have ideas in my head that I can   t get  out fast enough. I can   t make them fast enough. I almost just don   t want to  share them until I get them out. But it   s like that. It   s like when I wake up in  the morning. Sometimes it   s the first thing I think about. I guess that   s how  19  you know it makes you happy when it   s the last thing you think about and  first thing in the morning. I spend all day with it. Sometimes if I don   t like  the way something is going, it   ll end up in the bucket, but most often not. I  can do something with it.  Little Thunder Do you ever write things down?  Walkingstick I do. I do just to remember. There   s a buffalo nickel I really want to do and I  have the idea in my head. I want to do the front and the back. I don   t know  how I want it to work together at the front and the back. I want two pieces. I  don   t know how I am going to get them together. But I know how I want to  finish it. I know how I want to do it. I just haven   t got to it yet. I just really  want to do it before somebody else pops up and does it. (Laughter) I don   t  write things down. I don   t draw out designs. I just go. Like I said, they don   t  always end up as the design in the first place, so it   s really a waste. Most of  the time, they don   t end up as the design. So I don   t write them down. I  don   t draw them out. They just come as we go.  Little Thunder What is your creative routine? Do you work during the day more than at  night?  Walkingstick I   m a night owl. I do this a lot at night. Most days I won   t get started on  pottery. I   ll have my day and done my regular chores throughout the day,  then about four or five o   clock, I   m ready to start on pottery again. Some  days that will go all night. Some days, two in the morning   s usually a good  cutoff time for me. But it   s not unusual to find my light on at four. I do. I  work better in the evening. I   ve always been that way. My whole family is  that way. My dad always worked night shift, my brother and my son, so I  guess that   s all of us.  Little Thunder More quiet?  Walkingstick It is quiet. You don   t have to worry about the phone ringing. Nobody   s  calling to tell you anything or ask anything of you. No interruptions at four  in the morning.  Little Thunder How do you pace yourself to supply these shows? You have a pretty good  show schedule going, it sounds like now.  Walkingstick I do. This is probably the hardest time to get things ready is right around the  Santa Fe Indian Market. If you   re lucky, your inventory will take a big hit.  (Laughs). Then, to replenish that coming up with the Cherokee Art Market  is a big thing. You have a couple weeks in between. You do have to pace  yourself. Get as much built before the Indian Market and then, you have a  few weeks between other markets where you can get something done. I will,  a lot of times, have something started and then leave to go to a show. When  20  I come back, I   ll pick up where I left off and finish it. The good thing is you  can walk off from some these things. As long as you wrap them up really  tight and keep them moist, you should be able to come back to it and pick up  where you left off. That happens a lot, trying to catch up in the weeks in  between the shows.  Little Thunder Is there another potter you would like to work with or apprentice with?  Walkingstick Yes, yes, lots of Southwestern potters. I would love to   even if I don   t work  with them, I   d just like to talk to them more. I didn   t do this for a long time  and then I picked it up and I got really excited about it. There   s nothing that  make you happier than just being able to talk about what you are doing  because it   s such a lone thing. You   re not in a group making pottery, you   re  by yourself making pottery. To be able to get out with other people and talk  about the pottery, just to talk about it, is helpful. It makes you feel good. It  makes you energized. If you need a little recharge, just go find another  potter   Jane, Victoria  Mitchell Velasquez , Victoria McKinney. Just other  potters   go hang out with them. You   d be surprised how at the end of your  day you go,    I just I can   t wait to come home and get started. I got another  idea. I want to try this.    You get rejuvenated and recharged. It   s a good  feeling, just to be able to talk about it.  Little Thunder I guess you didn   t get to visit at Santa Fe Indian Market probably with any  Southwestern potters?  Walkingstick I didn   t. Everybody was really busy. I stopped by a couple booths and tried  to catch a few people before the show really got started. It   s hit and miss  because everybody is so busy trying to get going. But after the market, there  are so many more that I want to talk to that I   ve met. It   s nice. It   s a nice  little community of people. I   ve had a really good time and I   ve met some  great people in the last two years. Everybody I know in the Native American  art community, I have basically met in the last two years. That   s a lot of  people to remember. (Laughter) But they are so good, good in what they do,  it   s not hard to remember what they do. Maybe the name sometimes, but  you can remember a face and what they do. It   s really nice to get to know  these people. I met some really good people.  Little Thunder We didn   t get to talk about the Sherwin Miller  Museum of Jewish Art  show   in Tulsa  very much, but can you just explain what the theme of it was?  Walkingstick It was a show to showcase (I hate to say    showcase   ) the trials that we have  had in both of our pasts. The assimilation and Removal, and then their  concentration camps. I had the butterfly pot, the Monarch pot, and we  related some of our stories to their stories. Just the strangest things will  make the connection. The children in the concentration camps drew  butterflies on the walls as a symbol of rebirth and renewal. They put that  21  there knowing what their situation was and what their future might be or  might not be. It was a little chilling   I don   t like to look back like that. I  know that we have had some rough times like that. I don   t   you move past  those. You don   t forget it, but you try to see the good in it. I know that  sounds funny that there would be good in it.  Little Thunder Then the Southeastern focus show, which was Return from Exile     Walkingstick Uh-huh.  Little Thunder Can you talk just a little bit more about that one? It   s multi-media, I guess.  Walkingstick Yes. Some big names in that one. Troy Jackson, Tony Tiger, Bobby Martin,  Roy Boney, just a whole slew of them. Shan Goshorn. Just a whole slew of  people.  Little Thunder Did you get to go to the opening?  Walkingstick I didn   t. It was in Athens, Georgia, I can   t even think of the name of the     Lyndon House  Arts Center . It opened there. They took everything back to  where it all started. A few of them went out for the opening and we got to  watch from a distance. I love to see the pictures they had from their opening  night. I   m really proud to be a part of that, just the names that are in that.  They have proven to be great friends already. I appreciate those people so  much including me on their show. I can   t wait until it comes here.  Little Thunder Yes, do you know when it   s going here?  Walkingstick It   s leaving Athens, and going to Naples, Florida. Then, it will be in Little  Rock, Arkansas. I think it   ll spend about a month in each place. I   m not sure  when it will be here. I believe it will be next year at the     Little Thunder AHHA  Hardesty Arts Center ?  Walkingstick I think at a museum in Tulsa. I can   t remember.  Little Thunder Downtown, maybe.  Walkingstick At this moment, I   m drawing a blank on that. It   s going to be in Santa Fe  next year during Indian Market, I believe.  Little Thunder How cool. In your very short career, looking back, what do you think was a  real fork in the road for you?  Walkingstick Fork in the road. What do you mean?  22  Little Thunder A place where you could have gone one way, but you went this other way?  Walkingstick I thought when I first started, I truly thought that I would make Cherokee  pottery. I thought I would stay with making just Cherokee pottery. I   d seen  people like Jane  Osti  and Tammy Bean, just different ones. Crystal  Hannah. I just don   t think that is for me. I   m glad that they do it. I think that  somebody should be doing it. If there wasn   t anybody else, I would maybe  consider doing it. But we have those people, and it lets me do what I want to  do, the more contemporary stuff. I have fun doing that. I guess that   s what I  would say would be the fork. At first, I thought I would do that, but I   m not  really built that way. The contemporary stuff, doing the new stuff each time,  that   s more fun for me, it   s more of a challenge. It   s fun. But we need those  people to do their jobs, so I can do mine.  Little Thunder What has been one of the low points?  Walkingstick Low points? That   s a tough one. It   s so fun and I enjoy what I do. I enjoy it  so much that I can   t wait to get up in the morning and create some pieces of  pottery. I can   t really say that there   s a low point. I   ve had such a good two  years. I can   t complain. I can   t.  Little Thunder Can you identify one of the high points?  Walkingstick High points is making my teacher proud of me. My teachers. I want them to  know that I paid attention. I listened to what they were saying. Even the  people that have given me business advice, down to the person that told me  to smile when people come by. I appreciate all of it. Their words of  encouragement have been incredible. It   s been such a great ride for the last  two years. All of it.  Little Thunder Is there anything we   ve forgotten to talk about or you would like to add  before we look at your work?  Walkingstick No, I think I have talked more than I thought I was going to. (Laughs) I  thought what could I possibly have to talk about? I   ve only been doing this  for two years. What could you possibly want from me? I really have had a  good time. I really have enjoyed it, down to the last person I talk to. I enjoy  talking to the kids, the kids when they come by my booth. I try to encourage  them when I can. I   ve got little deals out there with kids when they come  back for next year. At Red Earth, I   ve got a little girl named Megan that is  going to come back. She was taking a pottery class over the summer. She   s  going to make one for me and I   m going to have one for her, and we   re  going to swap when we get to that show. Just little things to look forward to  and different things you remember about the people from each show. Sure  hope I don   t forget that I got to make a special turtle for this show for this  person because I want to make them happy and I told them I would. I will. I  23  look forward to seeing them again. Everywhere I go   I would never  considered myself much of a people person, but I sure do enjoy it. I sure  have enjoyed it.  Little Thunder Right. Well, we   re going to take a look at your work.  Walkingstick Okay.  Little Thunder All right, Karin, can you tell us about this piece?  Walkingstick This is a dogwood orb. It   s pretty heavily carved relief work. It has  dogwoods all over it. I just wanted to see how I could do. I had never done  a highly carved piece like that.  Little Thunder It   s got some beautiful colors.  Walkingstick Thank you. Took a while, it took a while. I started out with a really thick  pot. That   s not what you want to do as a potter is start out with a thick pot.  Little Thunder Is it heavy?  24  Walkingstick It was. It was really heavy before I started carving out a lot of that. It   s a lot  lighter now. The only opening is on the bottom. It   s about the size of a  pencil, as big as a pencil is round. It   s fully enclosed. It   s been painted using  a mason-stain mixed with slip and painted.  Little Thunder How about this piece, Karin?  Walkingstick This is Birds on a Wire. The birds were carved out a little bit, not highly  carved. They were meant to look like a shadow. There   s a couple of love  birds. There are some birds goofing off. One bird   s telling the other bird off.  One bird hanging upside down and his friend looking on. It   s a big pot and I  just wanted to have fun with it. When I got to the design part, all I wanted  was to have fun with it. I didn   t want to do anything serious. I just wanted to  have a good time with it.  Little Thunder Yeah, it   s fun. You can tell they are different kinds of birds, too. Okay, how  about this piece?  25  Walkingstick This was a commission piece for another artist. The turtle has a removable  shell. He   s painted with an underglaze on his body. His back was painted  with not only an underglaze, but it also has the color. Was painted with, not  only an underglaze, but besides the black, is the mason stain mixed with  clay or slip.  Little Thunder Aw, it   s really beautiful.  Walkingstick Thank you.  Little Thunder Great place to store things. All right. Now we   re looking at one of your  painted pots.  26  Walkingstick Yes, the hummingbird pot. It   s ruby throated hummingbirds and the flowers  with Cherokee scroll work on the top and the bottom, outlining those.  Again, that is mason stain mixed with a slip for the colors. The black outline  is an underglaze. What I did was I painted all the colors and then fired the  piece. Then, came back afterwards and sprayed it with an air gun, the black  on it, so the black fell into all the cracks, but it covered up my whole design.  Then I wiped it off and the black stayed in the cracks for the outlines, and  the rest of it wipes off.  Little Thunder Wow. That was quite a job burnishing this one, looks like it. Thank you so  much for your time today, Karin.  Walkingstick Thank you.  -------  -------
