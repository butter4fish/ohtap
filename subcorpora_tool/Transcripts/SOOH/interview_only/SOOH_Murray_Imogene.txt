 Wilson  Murray  Today is March 28, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. Today I   m in Stillwater, Oklahoma at the home of  Imo Murray, who I will be interviewing for the Stillwater History Series  of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project. So, thank you for  having me here, today.  I appreciate you coming down and thinking about me and everything.  I   ve got a few things I need to remember and need to say. A lot of  people just haven   t heard it yet. Thank you very much.  Yes. To start out with, would you mind telling me when and where you  were born?  I was born here in Stillwater, eight  August , third, and    29. That was  about five miles south of here up on the hill, and that   s where I was born  and raised at. Then we moved from there to something like three miles  to this side of Stillwater Creek. We were doing some farming and trying  to survive. During this period of time, I got a chance to see what the  people survived with and with a little bit to survive with. We had about  ten cows and maybe a few goats. I think we had some sheep. But the  thing about it I didn   t like a whole lot was I had to do some of the chores  of milking them. We had fun with them. We had a truck patch. They call  it a truck patch when you raise a block of potatoes, a block of sweet  potatoes and a block of all this, too, for us to survive the winter months  and other times.  We also would slaughter, I guess you say butcher, hogs. My daddy  would take that meat and my uncle, and they would put it in a big box  and salt it down to keep it because we didn   t have any refrigeration. All  of it, I look back and see that I   m glad that I was raised in that direction  in order to get the form of life as to what God created man to be. I look  5  and see how we are varied from that raising. That   s the reason why I   m  happy to get this interviewing from this person here because there   s a lot  of things that we have cut the rules and the laws, which was right,  wrong.  In school, I guess around six years old, and all I really wanted to do was  just hang around Mom because Mom was the lady. I   d watch her cook,  and I   d watch her fix biscuits, I   d watch her fix cornbread. We didn   t  have a whole lot to select from. So, mostly what we had is that salt meat  and that salted ham, and we were just tickled to death to get that because  I would go to some place and there were some that really didn   t have  what we were having. So, I learned how to be grateful, and I guess that  grew up in me because later on in life, I guess I was in the seventh,  eighth, tenth grade, I would watch how children would come to school  without. When I say without, they hadn   t even had a cold biscuit, neither  cornbread. It made me start looking around. I gathered thoughts, but I  didn   t have a thing to work with.  So, as I entered the school, the first thing that seemed like that brought  me a no-no was that I went to the school and I was very, very bashful.  You can   t tell now the way I speak and talk to people now, but I was just  bashful to girls. The teachers would look at me and I would just quiver  like I was hiding. Finally, my mother said,    You come here.    She said,     You   ve got to talk up in this world, and you   ve got to quit crying when  somebody holler at you or whatever else.    I had fun with it. During that  time   I heard you call me Imo. Well, how I got the Imo, the real name  is Imogene. So, that   s when the fun deal came in when many times as I  grew up, those high school kids, they get something on you and that   s it.  Oh, they just runned it in the ground. I said,    Momma, I ain   t going to  school no more.    She said,    Why? You   ve got to get your education  because that   s the basic principles of your life.    I said,    Well, I   ll stick it  out.    I always wanted to do what my parents said and done.  So, as I progressed, I found out what she said and what my uncles and  my daddy and them said, and then I ran around with him for a while, and  I seen him could talk to people just like it was just his wife or something  like that. That started breaking me in as to,    You   ve got to talk up.    So,  as we went along   and the first day   let me back up a little bit. The first  day when I got to school, I didn   t know nothing about no recess.  Everybody was familiar with recess. So, here come the kids piling on  out, and I   d done missed part of school that morning. I guess it must  have been ten, ten thirty. They shoved that door and just knocked me off  the porch all the way down, and I said,    I sure ain   t going to school no  more now     (Laughter)  It   s kind of comical because the thing it is what a person goes through  6  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  and a personal note, another personal note, when he went through it and  how he went through it, but I   m glad I went through it. Now, I   ve been  able to help in a lot of things that I   ve been publicized with. I   m not  asking for a lot of publicity, but I think a lot of people need to know the  truth. And the real thing is it   s not a bad life, but there are some children  now that need to go back to the first step of discipline, et cetera and on.  So, I believe, if I   m not mistaken, I had finished high school, but during  that time and everything, all the teasing and everything else     I played football and basketball. I really thought I was good at it, which  we were. We won two or three championships, football and basketball.  So, as I went through those things, I began to like it better than I did my  scholastic work. I just loved playing defense and offense tackle. We  have pictures and things to show us, but we were playing on the field  from where I live. I live on 9th Street, and I guess its two blocks over.  The Pioneers played in the same area. But anyway, to make that point  short, I learned how to   my daddy told me   and I must tell this   when  this integration thing came in and everybody was fussing about black  and white, my daddy told me already, he said,    Let me tell you  something, son. Every human being is a human being, and I better not  catch you looking at them and acting like you are better or they are  better.     So, when the integration came in, in the    50s and everything, I was  looking and acting, I said,    Something wrong with y   all because you  don   t have what I was taught.    So, I   m trying to keep you all on the  track of what transpired. Then, through the whole thing, I was glad I did.  My coach came to me in the summer and we were cutting grass for the  janitor, making a few dollars. So, he says,    I   ve got you a full  scholarship.    I said,    In what?    He says,    In football and in basketball.     Well, I could kind of hack that, but they had to kind of tell me what goes  along with it. Just, there it is, curriculums and the rest of it and  everything, your grade point. I said,    No, I really don   t want to go.    He  said I   m going. He said,    We   re going to get you some money, and we  want you to go out and represent Washington School.     How old were you, then? Were you a senior?  I finished school in 1949.  So, what year was this?  This was after. I   m a little ahead of myself. I   m glad you corrected me.  But during this time, I was telling that to go into the idea of the situation,  what we went through during the integration and all of the other stuff,  that   s a bunch of nothing. So, I need to back up just a bit. After I  7  Wilson  Murray  finished high school in    49, I decided before then to get twenty-five or  how many guys I could get to go Boy Scouting. They said,    Oh, yeah,  we love that.    I said,    We go out with pork and wieners and stay out  over night and everything.    They said,    Oh, we ain   t never stayed out  over night.    I showed them and later on, to me, it came to I   m glad it did  because I got a chance to be a mother and a father, per se, for those kids  because I found out a lot of them were fatherless, motherless, like it is  now, but it was a lot lesser than it is now.  So, I   m saying all this to say that right now, I   m feeling in the direction I  want to go just one more round, if I could, Lord bless. I want to still help  because also prevention has way been a whole bunch of trouble. We  have a prison. We have people that is going to jail every day. I spoke  and talked to a lot of the officials, roundabout sheriff   s office and  different places and other men, and I found out that,    Are you  concerned? Or you   d rather see a young man in trouble than to go ahead  and    You can   t send him to Boy Scouts again, but you can sure put an  arm around them, the four year olds and ten year olds,    Let me help you  out,       because we got now the discipline is very, very poor.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  There was nine of us. I guess you would come down to I was the  seventh. I had three sisters and all of these are gone. I just have one  brother left. There was five brothers. We all were sort of athletic  inclined. I learned a lot from them even down through their marriage. I  seen how things were going, seemed like to me and I guess you could  laugh about it, I said,    Let me see that. Talking about marrying going  on?    I never had got to that spot yet they was in because I guess I hadn   t  got the full lick. But anyway, I was watching them, and what I was  looking at and observing was it is a good thing that a whole lot of people  need to get a preview before they are married.  What I was seeing, I said,    Momma,    I came home one day and she  said,    What   s wrong with you, you   re all kind of half-crying?    I had  seen one of the two mistreating each other. I said,    Oh, no.    My heart  was always in half, being that she don   t need to get whooped upside the  head or hit or whatever else, and he don   t need to be cheated on or this  or that. So, these are the things that I picked up on. I said no. But bless  God, I guess it was an August of    I forget the day it was, but I married  my first wife. I had four biological children. The rest of them, they were  a previous marriage. But I accepted them like everybody should. I  accepted the wholeness of the individual.  So, it taught me how, like Jesus told us, all of us our sisters and brothers  in Christ. He died for that reason. But if we could just stop some of the  8  chaos and some of the things that are happening, I believe that all of us,  even in this city, if we   d just listen to someone that   s been over that  instead of letting the education be,    Oh, this won   t work.    Well, it won   t  work because you ain   t never tried it. Try love sometime, and that   s  what I am, have in my heart. That   s the reason why I guess that they  seen that I could work on the urban renewal, which was about ten years.  I worked on community service and everything there. I worked on a lot  of organizations that we didn   t get paid. But anyway, I kept my job, but  yet I would meet those guys at the city hall, and we would thrash out  some things.  I never will forget this. I think it   s worth telling. We were in a meeting  on the urban renewal, and it just so happened that I was the only one  who happened to be the Black American. We had one lady, and her  name was Dorothy Jane. I told them, I said,    I   m not equipped to sit on  this.    They said,    No, Imo, you   ll be all right. We   ll check your record.     But I was classifying myself as to comparing the education part, but a lot  of times all we need is some good brand new horse sense, some things  that we stepped over and are stepping over now just to make the dollar  bill. While I   m talking about the dollar bill, that is the one reason why  we   re not progressing because we put the dollar bill, those dollar bills,  ahead of the children and everything else. Mothers have gone to the  streets, daddies are going to the street and everything. Where are the  kids? Up there selling dope, ten years old.  So, I asked about that. I said,    I keep just letting this guy sit up there and  deal and look at TV. You need to have him cutting some of these weeds  down and put them to work. They   ll know what prison is like.    Give  them six months, they   re out and doing it again. I could say a whole lot  about this thing, those out of this and those are going to take their ideas.  And sometime when you want some questions answered   if I   m  living   I need to sit down and talk to you one-on-one, whoever you are,  one-on-one and tell you some things that worked for us because those  guys don   t mind going to jail. They just smiling when you go to jail  because TV, cussing each other out, whatever it is, and when I was  visiting, until the rest of the guys caught on that were visiting, I told  them, I said,    You can   t do nothing but give these guys Jesus. Jesus is  the only one that can help you. You do your time, you come back out,  and you go right back to the nest where the hatching is done.     What are we doing with it here in Stillwater? Nothing. We   re doing what  you think you ought to do through that other part, but they   re building  more jails without an ounce of prevention, I keep saying. You educators,  all of you. You ought to listen to somebody that   s been there, done that.  Most of those kids, I think those older boys, eight of them became men.  We got some that   s preachers, pastors, and some doctors. I look back  9  Wilson  Murray  and some of them got body shops and everything because I taught them.  I   m willing to still do it right now, even though my age, if I just have a  building, just a building where I could take five or six to ten guys in  there and show them the skill that I know. What I did for forty years and  everything, learn them how to do body work. How can a man do  something when he don   t know how to do it?  So, I would base the goal in there, so they charge the guys now, don   t  know how much money, he come out of prison, he ain   t going to do  nothing but steal your TV decks. I want you to get that, you guys that are  out there. I can still train them, and then I get them trained and they  won   t be sitting up in that jail using our tax money and the rest of them  on account of we won   t let loose. We won   t listen to what Reverend Imo  said. That   s the reason I chose Jesus to help me along this journey. I  appreciate if I can get a response from you. Not all at one time, but I  need to get a response, so we can talk one-on-one and I can tell you  more about what would help solve these problems.  When a guy goes to prison and comes back, he   s annulled and put out  because he   s got a prison record. So, what   s he going to do next? He   s  got to live. During all that, while we   re eating steak and everything else,  and still sending them to prison. Would you let your son go and go to  these places? You   d do something about it. But God help all of y   all.  God is looking at all these things we   re doing. I   ve pastored three  churches. First one was at Drumright for four years, the Lord let me do  that. Then out at Elk City for ten years, and now I   m up at Pawnee trying  to get them on the right road. But we as people is hard to get and grab  and learn that Jesus is the way. I don   t care what you got, how much you  got, but you   re going to leave it here and you   ve got to give an account  of what you did to this brother. This one over here, think about it.  How did you get the idea to start this Boy Scout group?  Through love. I looked and I like I said, I looked and my son was about  eleven years old. He ran with a little bunch around there. If you can get  them to go pork and wieners and swimming in the creek    They were so  integrated that they wouldn   t let us swim. We had to go swim in the  creek. Oh, we had fun doing pork and wieners. Later on, the Boy Scout  master, I thank God for him. He heard about the doings and he said,    I  heard you   ve got some boys going?    They gave us a charter number,  they gave us some more things to go with, and I said,    The Lord is  working here.     So, the idea that I already had, the Lord we know breathed on that and  have some more men there. So, we carried them over to Cleveland,  Oklahoma over here. They have a camp over there. Those guys enjoyed  10  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  it. So, they picked one up on that. But I asked a question.    Where   d we  get off at? When did we stop caring for the kids? All those children  know now is a babysitter. They know them better than they do their  momma. Excuse me, but you need to see about little John and little  Jimmy before you start having yourself a time.    So, stop and think about  it. The idea that I   m suggesting, we need to sit down at a round table,  you educators, all of you, and sit down and let me tell you the real story  of what was stopped. This economy, this whole thing.  The only thing I can tell this lady on camera and whoever else, is telling  me I love everybody and I   ve got to do it and you have to get to heaven.  Because if you ain   t loving and everything, John 3:16 says,    For God so  loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever  believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.    Oh, you can  go to church all the time, all the rest of your life, but unless you accept  Jesus   Romans 10, Chapter 9 says,    If thou will confess,    you big shots,  all of you,    the Lord, Jesus,    I didn   t say it, he said it,    and believe in  your heart that God has raised Jesus from the dead.    That was the power.  The main thing is believing. I tell people everywhere I go, I was telling  these young people that are sitting here now, trust in him, and I   ve been  falling, I said,    How have you fallen?    I just say to them, I say,    Lord,  you   ve got all the wisdom, you   ve got all the power, you raised Lazarus  from the dead. You can do all that. You   ve got a place for us to go. Let  me follow you.     We   ve got too many people educators that are not listening and  concerned about God   s bigness. Because, think about it, all the things  that are happening is because we don   t, I call it, obey. There are a lot of  people that   s grown that don   t know how to obey God. If all of us grab a  hand in hand from this moment on and say,    I   m going and we   re going  to have a good meeting,    you city dads and all of you, y   all, call the  plays and everything now. We   ll start praying at those meetings before  you start. Start asking the Lord to intervene instead of you talking about,     We   re going to move this block to here and close this one down over  here.    While you   re thinking about that, invite him in and he   ll fix the  blocks and whatever else. We   re more concerned about the materialistic  things than we are about John and Sue sitting up in jail, don   t know what  they   re going to do next.  What church did you go to when you were growing up?  Church of God in Christ.  Where was that located?  It   s located   and I   m helping them right now   Lawson Temple, which  11  is located on the corner of 11th and Hester. You might want to take it  because we   re moving in a direction and we   re selling a few things to do  some things and help the church out and expand and everything else. So,  we   re doing that. Also, up in Pawnee, I should be helping them because  we don   t have the membership to pay the tithes and do this. So, I   m  doing the best I can and that   s the reason why I   m glad I got this  interview because I need some help. A few of us can   t carry these  churches along. But at least somebody ought to come by and say,    Can I  help you, Imo?     Incidentally, did I tell you about how I got the name Imo? No, I don   t  think I did. After all of the hurray   s and what I went through and  everything else, I didn   t like it, so there was a lady   some of you guys  out there that read and hear this   her name was Mrs. Vicker that worked  at the First National Bank. I was kind of fussing  about my name . She  said,    That name, how did you get it?    She questioned me all about it  and everything. I said,    I don   t know, but I asked Momma a whole  bunch of times,    What was you thinking about?       Big ole guy and here I  am and everything, Imogene. She said,    You can change it for fifty  cents.    Then someone came in and said,    Leave it like it is.     So, I went on, and from there I went to Langston, now my name is on  the list of Dean of Women, Imogene, Mrs. Imogene. And if that wasn   t  embarrassing, because I was beginning to try to be an upperclassman.  They teased me on that. I went in the service and the name came up  somewhere, somebody is going to find you and everything, and the  captain says,    Your name is Imogene?    Right there on the deal. I said,     Yes.    He said,    Man, how   d you get that?    (Laughter) So, all these  things came to and then finally, I came back and I only have had two  jobs during my lifetime, just two jobs. And the first one I came back was  all you guys probably know Kenny Gallagher. He was one of the best  trackmen and award winners at Oklahoma State. He picked me up, I told  him what was going on, he said,    I   ll learn you how to press and clean  right now, that   s all I got.    He knew me and watched me and watched us  play football right down here. He would come and get me, bless God,  and I don   t have too many do it.  Mr. Winfrey Houston, bless his heart. I give him a lot of credit because  he don   t care where I   m at or whatever it is, or what, and if I   m not too  busy or whatever it is, he said,    I   m on my way.    He asked me  yesterday,    When can we have some breakfast or something like that?     He just wanted to touch base with me. But I   m feeling, you guys, you  educators out there, I don   t know how you come and how you come  about it, but we need to treat our fellow man better than we do. Because  you   ve got who you want to drink coffee with, but sometimes we can  learn from each other. The things that you don   t know now, if you  12  associate with some, you learn more and look on life better because God  made us all for a reason.  I   ve worked for  inaudible  for sixteen years, youngster, just got out of  high school. And I worked for Bellatti, Bob Bellatti, in and out, five, six,  seven years. Finally, the place had to be liquidated. I don   t know what  happened. They came to me,    Why is this happening? I   ve heard it  before.    He   s having to close us down. Well, I had had enough  experience, eight or ten years, and he said, the Spirit to me said,    Go ask  him.    Well, me and Bob were just close. Anything I   d ask him for,  he   d    I said,    Bob, I heard you was quitting.    He said,    Yeah, I was  going to tell you all.    He said,    What   s happening?    I said,    I   d like to  own a body shop. I don   t have the finances.    He said,    Let me think  about it.     In a couple of days, he came over. He said,    I   ve thought about it,    and  he says,    I   ll go to the bank, and see what   s going on. Then I   ll put a  spot in for you to buy.    Bless God, and I thank him. I had forgotten  about it. I went on and worked as I usually proceed to do and everything,  I was working for them. One day, I looked up and a big Lincoln drove  up right across from where you park at. I said,    This guy must know  something.    He had a big tie on and everything. Bob was over there, and  they beckoned for me to come. I went over there and they had a  package, three or four sheets. So, you know how the bank is, he says,     Imo, I haven   t met you, but I know of you.    He says,    If you like the  inventory, read it, and down at the bottom, see the figure there. If you  can deal with it, sign this.     I ain   t believing this. I   m standing there looking at it, and my eyes were  like a calculator. I knew everything that was in the shop there and  whatever else. My eyes went like (makes sound). I got down to the  bottom, bless God, you can   t guess what he had a month. I said,    Well, I  can trade a little ole dinner out for that and still have some money.     They had 125. I got to the 125, that   s  125 dollars a month. You can   t  get nothing now for  125. I said to myself   my former pastor that I was  under then, he had asked God. He said,    He wants you to have it all.    It  went in my mind. He said it was faith. I got in there. I said,    I can handle  that.    Called his name just that night. He said,    If you   re going to sign it,  sign it.    I signed it just like I signed this. This is yours.  I goes away like you know how,    I just can   t believe that I made this  guy. I can   t believe       A lot of the things that we can   t believe because  it   s what you wanted, but never in my life, one of the first black owners,  owning something in Stillwater? Bless God  It almost brang tears into  my eyes because I know he done that. By me knowing that, that   s the  reason why I can get confidence to you and all the rest of y   all that He  13  Wilson  Murray  will do it. Life goes on in a week, and we   re getting paid every Friday.  Someone said your check. I said,    You ain   t got no check coming when  you just make it working on your own.    Then it made me realize, talking  to you and the rest of y   all, you take God. And I went on and Lord  blessed me to work clear up to eighty-one.  Somehow one of the highway patrollers, a good friend of mine   that   s  the reason I say we need friends. He came in and I always would adjust  his doors or something. So, anyway, he said,    They   ve got an opening in  Oklahoma City.    I had my resumes and everything all set up. This might  be off the line, but I   m going to tell you. I went down and put my  resume in, and the guy got half way through reading my resume. He  said,    You ain   t got no business in Stillwater, neither way is what  you   ve done.    It was all of this that you   re reading in this paper. Boy  Scouts were Boy Scouts, the jobs, and whatever else and whatever it is.  If you treat people right, and you   re all out there, I might have some bad  connection with you, but I want to forgive. I want you to forgive me of  whatever it is and help me get over the dilemma that you might be  holding against me. God bless you.  Where was your business located?  11th and Main. The big ole building that you see, that big one. And I  don   t know what they   ve got up there, now. I was blessed with a   I  started out with kind of detail because I was almost tired of beating on  the fenders and doing all that. But it was good money. It was nothing  that you could make a thousand dollars a week or whatever it was. Then  later on, with some of the same guys that was in Boy Scouting, fourteen,  fifteen years old, I was using them to do the details. That   s when my  Arvin up here on Main, and Ralph and the rest of them right around the  corner, Rhema. You could see Ray   s Detail, go by and ask him some  day. Oh, I could have got some windows and things and it makes me  proud and happy to know that the God I know is letting me live this long  to express my feeling to the whole universe, the whole everybody.  Call me. You might have a spot for me. Call me. I might not be able to  do a lot of manual things, but I can still instruct and tell you what God  has learned me from dissecting a car and cutting it in half, in two. To  saving people money on their cars by knowing how to take the pressure  point and pop the dent out and all those things. I helped a lot of things,  people that were on welfare and I knew they couldn   t pay. They couldn   t  even pay their deduction, two or three hundred dollars. I told them, I  said,    You want that fixed? What kind of money you got? All I need,  really, is the material and give me some money for my labor.    They   re  not doing that anymore. They   ll charge you up to the gill, whether  you   ve got it or not.  14  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  I go back to that money. That money is ruining us all. So, I   m hoping  I   m answering the questions that I   m saying from my heart, but I   m  calling from this chair. Give me a break. Now that you know all how old  I was, it don   t make no difference. Age is not a factor. It   s what you are  planting in God   s vineyard because all of us are going to leave here one  of these days and we   re going to have to give an answer. Bless God.  We   ve got to give an answer. Why didn   t you at least step out and give  him a biscuit? Why didn   t you at least    You could have gave him a  foundation to build on. That   s all I ask, now. Don   t think I   m begging,  but I just need another star to help finish this dilemma, this thing that has  ruined us. Let   s talk. Will you?  We were talking about your name, earlier. What were your parents     names?  George Herman Murray, out of Texas. My mother, from down in the  same area, I don   t know how they got together or whatever, but her  name is Eula D. Murray, Eula Dean. She sure done a good job on us  boys, on me especially anyhow. This might be off the record, but for a  long time, I didn   t like Mom and them because they whooped too hard.  (Laughter) But I needed a bunch of them, a lot of kids now need that.  And you youngsters? While we   re talking, if you can listen on a piece of  this, get with the one that created you. It wasn   t your mom and dad.  There   s no telling where they at or what   s going on, but you get with  Him and He   ll be your momma and your daddy.  That name, Imo, rings everywhere. I can be talking on whatever it is and  they said,    Oh, this is Imo.    Whenever I turn around,    Is that Imo?     Yeah. You know what I mean? I   m identifying it, I need some help. Can  you give me that while you thinking about just letting me fish in your  pond? I love to fish, but I won   t abuse it. I   ll put that plug in because  fishing, the idea, all you people get worried and have to go and drink  you some cold beer, that   s all right, but go there and cast your cares  upon that water and the Bible says in a few days, you   ll be all right. I  hope I answered that question on the Imogene. So, all we did is we cut  the name out and then do this   I-M-O-G-E-N-E. The question says  when you put your sign up, Imo   s   and most of you all know it   Auto  Body and Detail Training. Imo   s, I-M-O-apostrophe-S. Remember that.  I   ll be putting some cars out because I don   t think the Lord is through  with me, yet. Those of you that know me, help me out.  Do you know how your parents came from Texas to Oklahoma, or why?  Lord, I just kind of used to kind of hear them talk about it, you know.  They always would talk about the farming. They was glad they got it  15  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  because most of them did what we call sharecropping. A lot of people  don   t know what that is, the youngsters. My daddy and them, his  brothers and them, had to pick so much cotton and give that to other  men. It   s harder than you think, y   all. For those that are listening, know  what sharecropping is. So, I said,    How come my daddy made a truck  patch?    He had us out there planting onions a half a block. Everything  he could plant, he put it in that ground.  So, later on, like coming up pretty soon, those onions going to be big,  the potatoes, the same thing the farm is. But if we take the men that are  in prison   I   m giving ya   ll an idea   and take some of this land that   s  barren, ain   t nothing on it, and get some of those tractors and get some  of those guys that are laying up looking at the TV on your money, and  plant and let them grow their own food. See how effective that would be  if you just did that. Some people need to hear this and what I   m saying.  There   s some ground that they   d be glad to loan you for miles around  and let them help take care of it. If it needs chopping, chop it. Rounding?  Then when harvest time comes, you can free every one of those  prisoners and everybody else that   s needing what they need. All we  doing is sitting around and away, waiting on a welfare check to come.  Oh, I might have said the wrong thing, but it   s making them lazy.  Did your parents have a smokehouse when you were growing up, or was  it just salt?  I called it a smokehouse, and I think that   s how I got introduced to  barbecuing. My daddy would cook any of those wild animals that was  permissible. Squirrels, that was just a drop in the bucket because we had  greyhounds, and he   d raise greyhounds to catch them jackrabbits and  cotton tails and coons and things like that. But it was a limitation on that  deal. I would watch him sit out there and in the little deal, the rack, with  some fawn and cook those squirrels. Cook it down there. So later on,  like father like son, I said,    Oh, that   s pretty good. It tastes pretty good.     Then word got all over town and pretty soon, my daddy had a reputation.  Later on, the Lord called my daddy home early. He was fifty-one years  old. I looked at that trade and I seen before that hog or that cow got  through cooling off good, he was telling us,    Boy, take this piece of ham  and stuff, and take it over there to Mrs. So and So.    We don   t do that no  more. We   ve got hog that   I   m sorry.  No, you   re fine.  I get carried away with this thing for the simple reason, we don   t do it.  We   ve got hogs we could let somebody have, half price. Cows that you  waiting on the market and you won   t turn loose because God was  16  looking at you. You could give instead of you waiting on the market.  Try God, give him a tenth of what you got. He   ll bring it home to you.  He   ll make that market come down. I   m saying all this to say that there   s  a lot of things you men grew up that, I   m sorry, I don   t think your  daddy, especially your daddy, didn   t teach you all these things. Why?  Because the modernistic time came in, and they didn   t get a chance to  take them to the Boy Scout ranch.  Did I mention Boy Scout? I need to mention this. At one of the  churches, the local churches, it was in our area. They told me three of  them, and I was real surprised with them being a minister,    Boy Scout,  what is that?    I didn   t want to explain it, and I didn   t explain it. I said,     Y   all excuse me, I   m in the wrong company,    and I left. That   s how  most of you all out there right now, you   re not listening. You listen to  the wrong people. You   ve got the wrong people in office. You   ve got a  lot of things because they ain   t doing nothing but got a reputation that,     I   m doing it     When it gets time to vote for you, they don   t even think  about it because you didn   t do what you said.  But I praise God for any of y   all. Hang with Jesus. Now, by that name, it  brought a lot of I would call it revenue, it might be another name. By  Imo, I got a chance to get all with a lot of things that helped me. I didn   t  tell you about this. Let me tell you this little incident. I wasn   t always a  church member, and I did some things, and we did some beer drinking  and things. So, I want to establish that so you don   t think that I ain   t  been no good boy all my life. But what I   m saying is that we were  coming from Guthrie or somewhere, and you know how youngsters are.  This time, I happened to be by myself driving. Somehow, the beers, the  cold boys we called them, had taken advantage of me just a little bit, so I  was going over the speed limit. Plus, I had some evidence laying in the  seat. Plus, I was going over the speed limit. (Laughs) All of y   all have  been there.  Bless God, I looked up, it couldn   t have been anybody else. I see a red  and blue light. You talk about what will bring you sober right quick, you  be illegal and the wrong person show up. All your lights are going to  come on on all your facilities and things. And not just one, but two,  because they know they had me. I   m searching in my pocket like,     Where   s the license at? What can I tell him?    I gave him the license,  but way back there they made a mistake on my license. They had  Imogene A. Murray. Okay? That   s just fine. Up in the corner, instead of  male, it was female. (Laughter) I noticed, I said,    They   re going to read  it and throw the book at me and everything else.    I was screeching, and  you don   t know what he   s going to say. When they turned around, I  looked at their face. It wasn   t the kind of face like,    We   re going to take  you to jail.    All they said is,    Imogene. You   re not that far from home.  17  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  We   re going to let the other officer take you home.    Nothing but a God.  When they misprinted and said female, that   s what they were laughing  about for the simple reason. Praise God  That   s in one of my articles.  That name saved me. That   s what I   m trying to tell you all out there.  Taking one name, one piece of name, I knew I was in for probably ten  years and some more. But I   m telling you all, but God, but God. I came  home, and I wasn   t married. I told a few people and,    Man, you were  sure lucky     You know, look, either he done it for a reason or he didn   t  did it. He saved my life and a few other things that happened with that  name. So, I just want to let y   all know, I kind of like the name now.  (Laughter) I like when they,    Hey, Imo. See you uptown somewhere?        That   s my girl, how you doing?    All these things mean a lot to me. I   ll  say it again, I   m not looking for something, but I   m trying to make my  expression. A lot of people don   t get the chance to tell on their life. But  we   ll be all right.  We were talking about barbecue and how your dad would cook all kinds  of meats. Did he have certain seasonings at the time, or did he just   ?  Secret.  But he did make up some secret seasonings?  That   s what I   m saying. I can tell you some and you can go ahead and  try it, and it might not be like mine. Salt, black pepper, that   s what he  was doing mostly, and that ole, we call it, hot sauce. It   s pretty cheap,  some sugar. Now, I graduated from the white sugar to the brown sugar  and syrup.  So, do you do a sauce?  And mustard. Yes, I make my own sauce. That   s what helped me along.  Do you know what they told me, and I didn   t do it and I neglected and  procrastinated? They said,    Why   d you put that sauce on there?    They  said,    Man, this is tops.    Well, I never did let too much blow my mind. I  knew it, but I wanted them to say it. They   ll like it. We taste the ribs, I  could be up in New York and you give me a call and say,    It was all  right.    Let them brag on you. If it was good, and you didn   t like it, and  you   re used to old Tom and Joe, that   s just right, keep it in. But I  guarantee you that taste, when I get through with it and everything, it   ll  hang around with you. And that   s what we want. That   s what the whole  world wants, satisfaction. You   re not getting it for some other reason,  whatever it is, but we   re going to continue because we   ll be here all  night cooking barbecue. (Laughter)  18  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  There   s a base. You just can   t take no meat and go in there and wash it  off. They call that mayonnaise it. You were going to mayonnaise it?  Some people put this on there, some never put no salt. I try to use as  much garlic powder as I can because salt will knock you out of the  block. So, now, I got a different sauce. I got a different sauce for a  different nationality. That   s right.  Why   s that?  We were raised up on a different direction of, everything   s hot. You   ll  burn somebody up if you don   t like hot sauce and I   m going to try it on  you. They said,    Everything is all right, but the sauce is burning me up,  and I   m still looking for a Coke or whatever else.    That   s one of the  reasons. The other one is if you make a medium size, one fit all, then  you in shape. A lot of them like my chop beef. That   s the main one. I  can make that quick. Chop beef, you could fix it all the way up and  everything and chop it up and put your ingredients in there and chop all  that up. Then, your sauce on top of both of them, and then heat it up in  the microwave at the same time. You can eat the whole thing. Five  dollars for a big ole    I ain   t talking about no little one. A little one, that  would probably cost you three dollars, but the other one, it   s going to  run up like the rest of them. You want to buy a good dress? You have to  help it up a little bit because they sure ain   t giving it away. You  understand where I   m coming from?  Yes.  So, that   s in that direction, and I   m veering off of the answer, I think,  and I   m going to keep it there, as to what you want answered.  Well, you mentioned your mom making biscuits and cornbread. What  are some other things you remember your mother making?  Greens. Short story about greens. You know, like at home, you just get  tired of the same old thing, same old thing. I   d come home, and we   d  play football or whatever. I said,    Momma, what you got?       Beans and  cornbread.       Oh, yes     With some of that ham hock and stuff in it, I   d  eat it the way it was. I   d knock two of them bowls out. That   s my baby,  cornbread, buttermilk cornbread. Sometimes we didn   t have the beans,  so she said   my daddy said,    Crumble it in.    I want you to remember  this. I said,    Pop, what you talking about crumble it in?    Well, we had  them bowls, and then we had the sweet milk coming from the cow. We  had an ice box full of that. Crumble it in, take the cornbread, crumble it  into the milk, stir it up real good. I   d slip over there, I didn   t want to get  caught, but steal a little sugar and stir it up in there. That was my other  main dish. Try it some time.  19  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Sounds good.  Yes, I   ll get you a Jiffy, put one egg in it. Just one egg and maybe a  teaspoon and a half of sugar. Don   t put no grease in it because I found  out   I fixed some, ain   t been too long ago, and it just crumbled all up.  Beat it up real good, and it   ll tell you on the box, and bake it. You can  just have that for you all this evening. See what I   m saying? But we back  at the biscuits and cornbread. I don   t see how she did it, but she made  biscuits that size. (Gestures) Boy, it would hold you. (Laughter) So,  Momma would make us get full on pancakes and all that, but she would  always save some of them biscuits. Biscuits and cornbread and all this  stuff goes into your turkey dressing. Got it? That   s how you can come  up with some good stuff for that. I won   t get off in that.  I   m going to finish answering your question. But it   s all good. The  reason why I know it   s all good because we   re living   maybe someday,  your grandkids or whatever else might not have all of this because the  way things are going, you better look and see what cabbage and meat is  and boil that or either fry it, the cabbage, put on in your Crock Pot at  home, slow far and while you at work, they cooking. When you come  home all you gotta do is just slap that cornbread together and y   all going  to feast on that, easily. Okay? Next thing, and I   m going to say, you use  the knife. I wanted to cook and since my finances kind of poor, get over  at that IGA, you catch them on sale on Wednesday only, a roast. The  beef roast is a little higher unless you catch them right, and right now  you ain   t. It might run you, I   d say, from twelve to fifteen dollars for the  roast. Get it, and you bring it to me. When you bring it to me, I   ll do the  rest. This will save you   like you went home this evening, and so I got  to cook. Slice it up, you can put your lettuce, tomatoes, whatever you  want on that. That   ll save you a whole day. Are you with me? Give me  another question.  How would she cook the greens?  That   s a good one. Wash them real good, real good, put them in a crock  pot if you want, if you don   t want to keep seeing about them. Cook  them, I would say, at least get them out of the store, where the water is  running on them. Get you one package of them, one package of turnip  greens, intermix them together, take some scissors and cut them up, so  they can get done fast. Because when you get through and get you a  package of ham hock, it ought to last you a long time because you never  going to have greens every day. Cook them and let that crock pot go,  and when you take your knife or fork, you can tell when they   re done.  They   re soft. Ain   t no such thing as overcooking them.  20  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  You can sit down with just that cornbread and say,    Mmm     Plus, it   s  vitamins in it. If you don   t get the greens, you can mix them all together.  You can get a head of cabbage, cut it in half, in two, because I don   t  know how big your family is, get that cabbage, slice it up the same way.  Chop it up. Deal with it. So, you   ve got cabbage, if you want to, you   ve  got cabbage, turnip greens, and collard greens. You might have to write  that down. Then that saves you from the store. You do that and you said,     Oh, keeps me from getting in here and cooking all this stuff and  whatever else. Let me do that.    Then you put that in the icebox in one of  them saver deals. The next three days,    Oh, I   ve got this in the icebox.  Let me warm that up.    Microwave, that   s it. Now, next question.  How old were you when you started to school?  Had to have been six or seven, six or seven years old.  And where did you go to school?  Washington School. I   m glad you brought that up because they had a  white building, and it kind of reminded me of a   there   s a rest home out  there on McElroy. It   s a big building, and this is what this was and that  size of it because from the first grade up to the seventh, all them went in  each part of that building to have school, classes. Then the other  department was sophomores, juniors and seniors. We put up with that  pretty good.  What I   m saying is that the whole children, a whole bunch were poor.  All black, all    So, really, we were raised predominately black. So,  when integration came, they wasn   t used to it and still ain   t got used to it  yet. It still is a misfit because the puzzle ain   t fitting. So, I said all this at  the raids in the school and we would put out   my cousin, first cousin,  was the first one that graduated, and I was down there in the  kindergarten. First one that graduated from Washington High School.  What was your cousin   s name?  Melvin  inaudible . Melvin, by his self.  Was that 1937?  Yes. You got a pretty good hook on that, now. You doing it. Then my  brothers and things came out to the end, and then it was like three or  four. We have pictures. I don   t know whether you know Candy or not,  but Candy spoke representing this deal about this deal over here on  Twelfth Street. But that   s the reason I say that, a lot of things that went  on and were said was misled. But by me being at home, and I don   t do a  21  Wilson  Murray  whole lot, but I do now, I want to kind of get in my mobile, so I can get  that going. Sit up there and see if somebody will want some bologna or  something, you know what I mean? So, I can get legal and everything  else.  But all of this is pertaining to helping somebody along the way. God will  be pleased with you, and even what you learned from us or me will help  you along way because a lot of the things you didn   t know that I   ve told  you is actually the truth. Yes. So, I can   t do nothing after I   m gone, but  that   s the reason I   m trying on some of those men and women out there  that got it, and I can get to help some of them. I   m not a bad boy, and  I   m not a bad man, but I   ve got ideas that the Lord has shown me a way  out. And if they utilize this same direction, but toward the economy, you  whacking on it down here in Stillwater, real good. When I say whacking  on it, you   re using the basic thing for what helps our economy, but you  won   t turn that loose because it   s your idea. I don   t ask for the credit that  the Lord has showed me all these things. I dare not  He got all the credit.  We wasn   t there when he made this creation, but we got up and got to be  ten years old and we know it all. Follow somebody that already know  and been there  Your daddy and the rest of them, right now, they can tell  you what you ever won   t grab. Education and all. Go ahead.  Who were some teachers you remember?  There was Lee Ward, he was our one. Bless his heart, he   s gone. The  next one, one of the best coaches that ever came through here was  Thomas Watkins. I   ve never seen a man that wasn   t too athletic, never  played the game, but yet still, he would come out and show us some  techniques, how to do it. The rest of them, it was because we loved the  game. Only chance I got to go to Sapulpa or anywhere else, got a ride. I  sure wanted to make the team and meet the other girls. All that was kind  of together and everything else. So, it helped a whole lot.  Mrs. Thomas. I   m trying to think of our   Norma Jean, she was our  sponsor. Bless her heart, she   s gone. She left here last, passed away. She  was our sponsor, so she would take   that   s how I learned about that,  sponsor. They would make little small sweet potato pies, cakes like that  and have them a bake sale, and we put in our treasure for our group. We  called it a little fraternity or sorority or something like that. All these  things can be taught to these people if they can see it, but what are they  doing now? They are being entertained by nothing. That nothing is  killing us. I ought to keep mentioning this because somebody needs to  listen. That   s what God was trying to do when sometime he brings some  chaos. Rain, it won   t stop, snow, whatever it is, I wish and some cussing.  Cussing the man or the people or the power that can turn your water on.  Got me?  22  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Yes.  One, I know, you got my water turned on now because I   m sitting here  conversing with you. Don   t recognize authority. All these big boys think  they it? Their name will be in the obituary one day. They   ll say,    Oh, I  knew ole John.    Yeah, but what did you do? Did you cheat people out of  their money and their property? Did you listen to ole Imo, what he was  saying when he said he needed some help? I ain   t talking about for my  pocket because all that you and the rest of them is hustling for is going  to die. Respect and get some of them millionaires and ask them if you  could,    How   s it doing old buddy?    Some of them might say it   s awful  hot down here.  Excuse me if I stepped on your foot, but the Lord is going to ask you,     What did you do with the life I loaned?    I preached on that. Did you  know that we just got a loan out with him? A loan  We don   t pay some  of the loan companies back. It   s some kind of refinancing, whatever it is.  But the loan he gives you is when he went to the cross and died for me  and you. And all you guys say,    Oh, he just talking.    I have a chance a  lot of times, every Tuesday, thank God, for me to preach at the Christian  church, as I instruct it.  You know the church on McElroy and what   s it called? Up here. I get  around and listen. You listen to every man   s view about the Bible, and  I   m just like you sitting there right there. I learn from what they learn.  See what I mean? Some my age and some a little older. But I listen, I  grab me a whole bunch of it, and I say to myself, and I got to do this in a  little bit, I should have done it   I need a recorder. Everything I   ve said  today, I wish, if you could get me a copy of what I say and what I done,  and that and everything else. I   ll just put it on and be frying some eggs  down here. I   ll be listening,    Imo, did you say that?    or whatever, you  know what I mean? Because it   s amusing to me, some things that the  Lord let me say that I forget that I said it. That   s the same thing with  children, they forget that I told you to empty the trash, but they ain   t  going to forget the recorder.    I   ll give you twenty-five cents,    they   ll  wake you up with twenty-five cents.  While you were going to Washington School, did you have much  interaction with white students your age?  When we call interaction, that meant to and fro and exchanging deals,  that was a few. I go out with a couple of people at the bank, University  Bank and a few of them. We go out and talk, and one of them went to  school almost after I did. Kind of an inner, created everything there, and  we talk about how we played football or I did this and everything else.  23  Wilson  But to tell you the truth, I really didn   t because I looked at it, and that   s  what made me almost cry. Why wasn   t they? There was   what I say is  that   and you all take a listen to this. What you teach in that family is  going to sure come out when he get out. I   ve seen it. I   ve been in the  store, oh, using the n-word or whatever. You taught him that and then  you go and half-kill him.    You know better than that, John     I say,    You  taught that little boy at home,    and I keep walking.  That   s what you taught, and that   s what it is at this university. Sorry to  say. These schools. It   s good to have fun, but they come to just have  some fun. Momma and the sulk soul and everything else, they fall to get  Joe to go to school. And you out there toe popping, going to reap it. I   m  saying this all day because it   s the truth.    Wrecked the car, don   t make  no mind. Mom will get one.    But when Momma   s gone, and dad, that   s  when it gets from bad to worse because it allows somebody to go get  him a gun and get what I want. It   s a long story. Long story to what I   m  saying. But Jesus said in his word, he said,    If my people      he   s talking  to me and you and all of them,    If my people, which are called by my  name, would humble themselves, turn from their wicked ways      you  know it says wicked, rape, and everything else      turn from their wicked  ways, kneel down and pray, then      not after awhile      then      it won   t  be no Lebanese and that stuff over there because we   ve all become  friends.  You can   t fight a fire with a fire. Somebody get burned up. But if you  show like presidents and some of them have gone to the reach, they   re  working and negotiating with people over there. And all they know is,     Let me build this atomic bomb and get rid of all of them.    It looks like  somebody ought to listen at this hour and call on God and stay calling on  them until they make a change. All they are talking about is who can win  the election. And when I hear the conversation, if I can help, I will, but if  you ignorant to the fact that you are sold on black, white, green or who  did this, all of it stems from President Roosevelt all the way up here.  They left a scar that the next president has to pick up and get that way,  and that way, and that way, and up to Obama, now. To me   and I   ll just  tell the truth   he   s done a whole lot more than a whole lot for the simple  reason that if you get to be president, who can I leave and trust in your  hand? Do you know enough? Do you love the people enough to go to  the bat with them? Quit fussing about the presidency. All the people that  are running for president and them that got the hate spirit, if they would  go in and join hands and put their knowledge, the little knowledge what  they got with the president and say,    Let   s all push this wagon.    But you  can   t push it if some are pushing from uphill and some from down. You  remember that.  Speaking of politics, did your parents talk about politics much when you  24  Murray  Wilson  Murray  were growing up?  I didn   t understand it. I would say just like I couldn   t understand why a  black man and white man hated each other. Well, in the first place, I  didn   t run with that. I didn   t let that come in because the pigment of my  skin here kept them away because they thought I was a black one and  don   t let that get off. I   ll never forget this one time I was up at the shop.  Me and this ole boy were pretty good friends, and we worked together  for four or five years. I could tell that he wanted to do something that a  whole lot of people wanted to do, all right? He kept on and going and  everything there, then my hands and everything, he kind of hit them. He  came to me and said,    That ain   t what he really wanted to do. He wanted  to touch that hair.    Human, you know. I said,    Man, I know your  problem with why you   re holding up. If you don   t tell the person, then  you don   t know.    If you don   t tell your boyfriend or husband you love  them, you   ll never get it out.  I told him, I said,    Man, let me have your hand. Better than that, come  here.    I said,    Put your hand up here.    It was black, cold. He was  satisfied, bless God, as if he had a brand new suit. He went to laughing  and said,    How did you know that?    I said,    God gave me that,    and I  said,    That   s what is wrong with the rest of them.    I bleed just like  everybody bleeds. Doctors give me a shot, give me a shot. They say,     Rest up,    I   ll rest up. God gave them doctors the same wisdom to  operate on me to stop my headache or whatever else. So, what   s the  problem? What are you   I   m here. I   m like Martin Luther King. We   re  all here, and we ain   t going nowhere. But learn how to love like God as  he loves us. Praise God.  I guess I could   I know I could talk all day. But one day somebody will  listen to this recording or see it, and you say what you   re going to say  and say,    Boy, that ole boy sure told the truth, but I can   t go along with  it.    Well, when you get to another place, ain   t no other place that you  can come back as a man and get it right. Get it right now. Read the  Bible. Revelation tells us about hell and heaven. Some people don   t  believe that there is a heaven or a hell. Over in Revelation, it tells that in  hell   it describes heaven, what it   s going to be like. Nice, loving each  other, not paying attention to what color you is. We   re all rejoicing. But  the other place, if you miss it and go down there, I   m talking about  forever. What else you got?  Would your football team in high school only compete against other  black schools?  They hadn   t got there yet. Blacks on blacks. Places like Ponca City and  Sapulpa, when I was playing, and they were there because we called it     25  they were limited to C class. That   s the size of the school, then B class.  And A class playing like the Pioneers. They   ve got that many. They  were up kind of in the A class. I remember when the Pioneers were just  B class and C class. So, they classified them in, so still blacks stayed on  black. I   ll tell you this. A lot of people can   t see it and don   t know it, but  during the time of these times, you are men together because black   s  language, black   s whatever it is, because they understood each other.  But I never could understand. And all of them do it cussing.  What I   m trying to say is on your set about the football, whatever it is, if  they   d have started fifty or a hundred years ago, by this time   see, the  now generation of youngs overlook all this racial stuff. Ain   t nothing  that you see a white girl and a black man dating and going all of this.  This was a no-no with a whole bunch of them, but what I   m saying, He  made us all ain   t no different as they say in the Jews and the Gentiles,  ain   t no difference in me and you. I get hungry like you do. So,  answering these questions, I wish it had. I remember several times I  think I was in seventh grade and Ralph Hamilton was the coach of the  Pioneers up here, and they hadn   t left from right up here, yet. C.E.  Donart wasn   t even a thought then, maybe. The ref, I heard them talking,  him and Tom Watkins. He said,    Hey, Coach. Why don   t we just  scrimmage against them one time?    Tom said,    Just fine with me.     I ain   t got no answer to it, but I   m going to say this. Our team wanted it  bad. I don   t know if it was a grudge or whatever it was. So, Tom told all  of us, he said,    I   ll fire you off the team if I catch you doing the  opposite.    He said,    You just grab him instead of tackle him and just  kind of hold him.    He said,    We building the scrimmage against each  other.    We did this several times and pretty soon, what we called a  common, we   d get too common with each other. Bless God, one of them  hit the guy and our coach come out of his skin, it looked like. He said,    I  told you, you go to the shower.    Well, the school was right there, and we  was doing it right there because the Pioneers would come out here and  practice because they didn   t have no football deal. They even played  their games right down there. I can take you and show you where they  was. Where it was built.  But anyway, that   s the whole part of the deal and pretty soon, when they  found out that blacks was a good athlete and winning games,    Yeah,  y   all come on in.    You hear the stories, you know. You wasn   t born  yesterday. But what I   m saying is that they could have been doing it all  along. We could have still been eating biscuits and gravy, cornbread.  Now, all of them are learning how to eat it because this economy, before  it gets too bad, we   re going to be eating out of the same plate. I thought  I   d just put that in there because we never know. That verse, what I read  awhile ago was second Chronicles because I think the seventh chapter     26  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  the seventh chapter of Chronicles, second Chronicles, when he was  talking about my people. You talking about a God that can shut  everything down. Go ahead.  How many people did you graduate with?  Six.  Six?  And I looked over everything there, and I said,    I should have got that  picture.    I graduated with my brother. He went in the army and that  threw him behind because he was a senior when he was drafted in the  army, all right? Other name was Erma June Lawson, which married a  preacher. Other one was Dawson Lawson, which I was intending to  marry, but I thought it wasn   t    (Laughs) All these people came,  relatives, kinfolks, and there was another girl. All these girls, I like them  pretty good because they would help me with my lessons. I wasn   t the  brightest one, but I knew where to go to get touching base with them.  (Laughter)  I made it through, so my home economics teacher, when I mentioned a  while ago, was named Wynona Clay. She said,    Imo, I know what  you   re doing.    She said,    Them girls like you because you play football  pretty good and the rest of it. You bring them some of them pecans and  apples up here, and they help you with them reports, but that   s going to  hurt you down the line.    I said,    What?    She said,    You get it on your  own because       And sure enough, I chose a major when I got to  Langston, and I had never studied on that French and some more things.  I had never studied. My flash came back,    You   re going to need it.    But  I didn   t on the count of I was dependent on the girls.    Can y   all get that  for me? I   m kind of sore tonight and whatever else,    some kind of lying  excuse. Sure enough, it   s just like I   m talking now to you and these  people, we would have wished that we   d have listened to somebody that  gave wisdom. They didn   t even want to listen to Jesus. Sodom and  Gomorrah, they said right there and didn   t obey and all of the whole  thing went down.  Did you have a graduation ceremony at your high school?  Yes. I was just proud as I could be, but you know, and I   m going to tell  you, I guess I was crazy or got funny ways. I   m crying going to the  principal, done finished. Walk across the stage and turn around and  everything there. (Laughs) Bless God, I   m asking them,    Mr. Ward, this  might sound funny, but can y   all put me back another year? Let me play  one more year.    I did that. A lot of people I   ve told that, they said,    You  27  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  crazy.    Someone said,    I quit early.    I said,    No, I ain   t quitting. I still  want to play some more football and get the thrill.    That   s what it was, a  thrill to me. I   d rather play defense than eat. And then at that time, I  could eat up some. But I   m going to tell you what I liked. Then, after  then, I know what it was, my grade point got low, and you can   t stay in  no place unless your grade points are up. They   ll take scholarship and  everything else. So, I came home. Not quite before I came home, my  father passed away.  And this is from Langston?  From Langston. And it hurt me because I done lost everything,  everything that ever would learn, but the Lord grew me up. You might  ask about these historic things and all that and everything else, all this  for a reason. There is a reason that you are sitting here doing what  you   re doing. A lot of people ain   t interested. But bless God, He touched  you in whatever else to get to this, whatever needed to get done. See  what I   m saying? You   ll never forget this day. As long as the Lord  breathes your breaths alive, and you   ve got something to talk about,  something with some of your friends.     I interviewed Imo and he told whatever he could.    I   ve got a tape that  I   ve already made of my life. A guy named Muhammad, bless his heart,  he needs some help, too. He got all the equipment, stuff like you and  everything else, but he needed to get out there. I wasn   t asked to get out  there when I was messing with the Boy Scouts because I seen danger  down the line and my boy was Steve, Steve Murray. I didn   t want to see  him... I seen a few prison people. That was a part of my making up my  mind. That   s the reason I have to depend on the Lord for my help. A lot  of people don   t know what my intention is, but sometimes in speaking  and preaching at the churches I look at people and say,    I wish you  really knew. I wish you would really open up.    It   s just like being in  love with somebody and they don   t love you. That   s hard.  When did you become a reverend?     59. I was a deacon for fourteen years. Superintendent of the Sunday  school before then, something like thirteen years, this old lady appointed  me. She said,    Imo, I   m getting old, I want you to be superintendent of  Sunday school.    I learned basically a lot from that. I said,    Tell anybody  if you hang around people that has an inclination of what the leadership  of what God   s saying, you ain   t going to go wrong.    So, in    59, I  couldn   t take it no longer. Pastor lived right next to that church and they  added on to that. It was a white building. He and his wife and his kids  grew up right there, but they live in Oklahoma City now. They   ve got a  church. But he was taking out his time and to me, he poured out the  28  Wilson  Murray  spirit that everybody needs on us. Believe it or not, it is sad, but I am  glad that the Lord sent him by. He made history. Twenty-four ministries.  I ain   t that much   two. Twenty-four, all mostly integrated. Some from  overseas. But they heard the call. Some would leave at a time and they  told us, he said,    It   s going to be kind of like       We done got off into  the real stuff.  What else should we talk about?  I   d really basically kind of like to end it there. Preaching and being a  part of an integrated church. See, Caucasians, blacks, and all, somehow  they misheard what Jesus said. He said,    All of y   all are my children.  That   s the reason I   m going to the cross,    and died for them.    Y   all ain   t  got there yet. Y   all still up in my loins,    from Adam and Eve, on. But if  somebody would wake up and listen, my dream was, it seemed like to  me, he said,    I need somebody.    Jesus was up there because it   s the God  head. We might not have got to that. The God head is the one in the  three. I might be telling you something you didn   t know. God, Jesus,  Jehovah, and all is the same.  My son said,    How can that be?    How can he take and make a ground  that tons sit on? That   s one of them. How can he take a flower that is  planted, in a few months, it   s blooming out? How can he take and put a  body together and make it function and behave while I   m eating a hot  dog? I could go on and on, but what I   m saying is, I said,    I need to go  tell it.    To me, it seemed like, at first, it was kind of like when I first  started playing football. They taught me up pretty good, the  upperclassmen. To keep they position, they hit me hard. Some off in that  told me, said,    Hang on.    Some of them quit. Well, I stayed where I am  on this and that. I can   t quit. I can   t quit if I wanted to.  From the time that he   the big one was when he gave me that shop. I  didn   t have a nickel, but the interest, he fixed it. I got a chance to even  down. During that time, me and a guy by the name of Archie Garrett,  Mr. Sanders from the Pioneer area chose me and Archie Garrett, which  is another black dude, we were kind of top men in auto body. When I  say that I   m not bragging because a lot of times, they   d bring us or bring  me a car. I   d write the estimate up and said,    Oh, we   ll just hold that,  now. Can   t fix it.    Then, I   m glad I knew the Lord, I said,    Can it be  fixed?    As your instructor down in Oklahoma City told you, any metal,  you can make that metal obey you with a torch and a know-how. There  are places   now, this is kind of off the record   a lot of people go down  with these cars and dents, if you go to the pressure point, honestly, I  know because you can tell it   s my little secret   and you pop it out, a  five hundred dollar job.  29  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Murray  Wilson  Wow.  That   s how I got the reputation. Oh, that Imo is crazy. I had a come-along  and everything else to do it with. I talked to the Lord and I said,     Lord, how can I do this without you showing me?    Sure enough, some  of the football players I got acquainted with, and I had them all coming  down there and some more because they didn   t want Momma to know  that they had wrecked the car. I said,    Give me what you   ve got. I know  you   re going to school, and I can come over about five hundred. Give  me that. Write your John Henry.    All these were making friends. I said  all that I say, that was keeping in touch with people and doing all right.  Now, what   s your next question?  Did you have many challenges starting your business out to start with,  being one of the first black businesses in Stillwater?  No, because reputation, if you   ve got reputation, it   s going to get out  anywhere, good or bad. Prisoner, they   ve got you stamped already. Me,  by me helping so many of them, the word got out.    Man, take it down  there to Imo.    Sure enough, I had to call the wreckers, I said,    I can   t do  nothing with this one,    and they   d take it off. Now, what they   re doing  now is R R. What they call   they take the fender off. We aren   t talking  about no straightening or whatever else, they just go and buy a fender.  Got it? So does that answer your question on that? Communication. So, I  got so good, they were talking about competitive, and they was coming  to ask me. I was glad to,    Yes, yes. I   ll be able to help you out.    But  now I can   t get help. See what I   m saying? Barbecue. Different crew.  See, it   s a thing as a different people come along don   t think like we  was. They don   t obey like we did. I   ll cut it off right there because we   re  going to be here all night.  Okay. (Laughs) Thank you for talking with me.  I appreciate talking to you, and I think I   ve said enough that we can  listen to it again and whatever else. Like I said, I didn   t ask for this. The  Lord set it up. I appreciate my wife for just being here and being a part  of it, too. All right?  Yes.  -------  -------
