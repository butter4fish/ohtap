 Finchum  Sanford  Today is October 5, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project featuring the Cooperative Extension workers through the  years. Today I   m in Sulphur, Oklahoma with Bob Sanford. Thank you  for having me.  You betcha.  Let   s get started by having you tell us a little bit about where you were  born and your childhood, and then we   ll work our way forward.  I was born in Locust Grove, Oklahoma. That   s eastern Oklahoma. I went  to the grade school, high school, and then from high school I went to the  army. After the army I went to Oklahoma A M.  Let   s put some years with that process. When did you graduate from  high school?  1944, I graduated from high school. I was seventeen. Then I had my  nineteenth birthday over in the Philippines, overseas. That was during  World War II and a lot of the young guys went from high school. Then I  spent a year or two back running around after I got back from service  before I started college. I forget the year. I think it was    47 or    48 when I  started college then.  And that was Oklahoma A M.  Oklahoma A M, right.  And where did you live when you were on campus?  In a private home.  5  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Not Vet Village?  No. Well, yes, we had a Vet Village, but I didn   t stay in it. I wasn   t  married then.  Oh, you had to be married?  I just stayed in private homes.  And why OSU?  Well, my Vo-Ag teacher was from Stillwater and he was a national  wrestling champion in 1932 and he talked about Oklahoma A M. Also,  State 4-H Roundup is held at Stillwater and I was a 4-H member that  made the state trip a couple of years. I liked what I saw there. So, I  decided to go there and agriculture was my field.  So, you did some 4-H during high school?  Oh yes, yes, I was in 4-H in grade school and high school. Then in high  school I was in both, 4-H and FFA.  And what were some of your projects?  Mainly swine projects. I showed a lot of hogs. Corn and cotton were my  other projects.  So, you had grown up on a farm?  Oh, yes.  And what did your dad do?  He was a farmer.  What did he farm? Was it cattle?  No, he raised corn, cotton, wheat, and oats.  So, you had to pick a little cotton?  Oh, yes. We had to pick cotton and ride on the cotton wagon with a little  other kid to the gin.  Where was the gin?  6  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Locust Grove. We lived about two miles from town.  And did you have other chores?  Oh, yes. My chores were feed the hogs and gather the eggs. (Laughter)  Those were my two chores when I was a small kid.  Do you remember when electricity came to the farm?  Oh, yes. It didn   t come until after I had come back from the service.  Oh, a long time.  Electricity came to the farm in 1946 and so, we had to make out before  then to try to keep stuff cold. That was hard.  And to get up for school in the wintertime was pretty tough, I bet.  Oh, yes, yes.  Did you heat the house with wood?  Both wood and coal.  Coal.  We had coal too, but mostly with wood. We had a big stove and of  course, then, there was the master bedroom which was also the dining  room, the kitchen, and the living room, probably all together.  Brothers and sisters?  Oh, yes, I had   there were eight of us.  Oh, big family.  Big family, three girls and five boys. Right now, there   s myself and one  of my older sisters is still living. She is ninety-five.  Where is she?  She is in Locust Grove. Her and her husband, both. They   re the same  age and they still live on the farm, still do their own dinners and  breakfasts.  7  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Did any of the other ones go to college?  No, no. I had three boys. Two of them went to college.  OSU?  One, one did.  Okay.  Yes, he is quite an OSU boy. He lives in Dallas now, but he is an OSU  alumni. He is in the position that he can   he helps   he gives a little bit,  I   ll say, to the college.  Well, when you were on the farm, did the county agents come out to the  farm?  Yes, not very often. Not very often.  But you were aware of that as a career choice?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I liked my county agent. (Laughter) In fact, I can tell  you his name. It was Oren Stipe.  There you go. Okay, so, you got to OAMC and you graduated. Then,  what was your first job?  4-H agent.  Right out.  Right out of college.  In which county?  Woodward County. Let   s see, I could tell you who it was that took me  out there.  Curly Ives.   Well, that   s quite a ways from home, wasn   t it?  Yes, it was. I   ve almost got his name. Anyway, he took me out to  Woodward. It was the first time I had ever been way out there. My wife  and I met him out there and it was cold. In fact, it got five below zero  that night, out there. There was snow on the ground. We had a hard time  getting there, but we made it. So, we met with the county commissioners  and the agent   and by the way, I knew the agent. I didn   t know him  8  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  then, but I knew his wife when I was a kid because she was raised in  Locust Grove also. Then we found this little apartment to live in, and  that was our start of the program.  Well, we should back up then. When did you marry your wife? How did  you meet her?  She was from my hometown too. Not my hometown, but it was one of  the towns that you don   t care for them, but you still go with the girls  there. (Laughter) She lived eight miles from my hometown. She lived in  Salina, Oklahoma.  Did she go to Oklahoma A M, too?  No, she didn   t. She didn   t go to college.  But you had married before you finished college?  Yes, yes.  Okay. She didn   t mind going out to Woodward?  No, she didn   t. She didn   t mind going wherever I went. She didn   t have  a career at that time. She went wherever I went. We stayed a year and a  half at Woodward. Then they did away with the 4-H program for some  reason there, and the commissioners offered to pay my entire salary to  stay, but Stillwater wouldn   t let them do that. I wouldn   t be in Extension  if they did that. I   d just be a county worker. They wouldn   t do that so,  they transferred me to Kay County.  A little closer.  Newkirk. There at Newkirk, we lived on the farm there. First, we lived  in a big two-story house right in the middle of town. Oh, we were there  about six months and we found us a place at the edge of town at the farm  so, we moved out there. Now, we didn   t have running water. We had a  cistern, but we made it. We put a lot of chickens and we had cows to  milk and we butchered. Do you want me to tell you a little about the  process?  Sure.  Okay, at that time, we were on a gravel road and every summer, the  agents went three weeks to summer school. I was close enough I could  drive from Newkirk to Stillwater, and stayed at home during that time. I  went to the three-week school and then I   d get off at noon or one  9  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  o   clock. I   d head to Newkirk. We had a bunch of chickens that needed to  be butchered, fryers. So, like I said, we had no running water, but we  pumped up a lot of water. We got an old woodstove going for water and  heated it.  Her sister, two of my nephews, and a friend of theirs had just graduated  from high school at Locust Grove and they   d come to visit us so, I put  them to work. (Laughter) We had us a little assembly line going on those  chickens. We butchered about fifty chickens one afternoon there. We  killed them and dipped them in hot water, pulled the feathers off, and  then they   d go in the house. Two others would clean them and be gutting  them, wrapping them, and putting them in the freezer.  How did you butcher them? What was your method for butchering them?  I pulled their heads off.  Did you have a motion or whatever you did for how you did it?  Ring them. No, I did not ring their heads because I couldn   t. I wasn   t  that   I just never could. My mother could, but I couldn   t. I   d just take  that board, step on their heads and pull up. That   d pull their heads off  their necks. Nobody saw me.  Well, if there wasn   t electricity how did you   oh, by then there was, I  guess?  No there wasn   t any electricity   oh, yes. They had electricity where I  was at, but we had no running water. No hot water.  And for the freezer, you needed electricity.  Yes, we had electricity there. Then I couldn   t have killed my chickens.  Then the rest of them, the hens, we left them for laying hens. That   s  where we got our eggs. In fact, we separated cream and sold it in town.  We sold some of the eggs. That   s how we got feed for the chickens and  the cows.  So, how long were you in Kay County, then?  I was there four and a half years.  And your title was?  4-H Agent. It was titled 4-H agent for a long time.  Curly Ives  took me  out to Cheyenne or somewhere out in there, Roger Mills County. I didn   t  10  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  like that part of the country. So, I turned it down. Then after four and a  half years, a job came open at Bristow. That   s Creek County and there  were two offices there in Creek County, one in Sapulpa and one in  Bristow. The county agent was at Sapulpa and the 4-H agent at Bristow.  The agent at Sapulpa used to be the 4-H agent in Bristow and he got  moved up to the county agent at Sapulpa.  That job came open and so, I came down, looked at it, and I thought,     I   ll just take it.    Well, my county agent at Kay County said,    No, I  don   t want you to go. I   ll get you a raise,    I said,    I   ve been here four  and a half years and you haven   t given me one yet that I like. They  offered me more money so, I   m going to take it.    (Laughs) So, I just up  and moved to Bristow. I stayed there ten years, exactly. Then I a job at  Stigler opened up as a county director and 4-H agent, both there, and I  took that one.  Another pay raise?  Another pay raise. (Laughs) Yes, now, there was an agent in Tulsa that  wanted me to come there as a 4-H agent because he had lost his 4-H  agent, Roy Sharkey, who was a very good agent. But the money wasn   t  much better than what I was getting there at Bristow. I told them no, I  couldn   t do that. My family didn   t want to move to Tulsa. So, we took  the job in Stigler. I was there eight and a half years when the Carter  County position came open. Bill Parham was a district director and he  wanted me to put in for Carter County. I said,    Okay.    So, I did. See,  there were three of us, I think, that had to go to Stillwater at that time to  be interviewed. I got the job there in Carter County. I stayed there  exactly ten years and I retired in    84.  Oh, so, there was some competition along the way in between jobs.  Oh, yes. It got to be competition, you betcha. Yes, you had to have some  programs going. I had a good program going at Stigler in Haskell  County. It was a beef program   beef cattle.  Was there much difference between the counties as far as the work you  did or the atmosphere?  Yes, there was quite a bit of difference because at Newkirk I was strictly  4-H. I didn   t do any adult at all. The county agent didn   t want me to. He  let me test some soil at night up there. I could do that, but as far as adult  work, no. I didn   t get to do anything in Kay County, but in Bristow,  being in an office in Bristow and one in Sapulpa, the Bristow office did  all of the soil testing work and all that. So, I got to do all of that, plus the  4-H. Then at Haskell County, yes. I had to do both, agent and 4-H. I  11  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  enjoyed it. The people were all very good people. There wasn   t too  much difference in them.  Do you have any favorite stories from experiences or fun moments or  something like that?  Well, I guess a fun moment is Buster Ford at that time was one of my  favorite friends in Extension. Long later, Ron Sharp was. He   d come  along later, but at that time, Buster Ford was. Agents used to have in the  summer, a county agents get-together, which would last about two days  or maybe three sometimes. Well, I furnished nearly all the fish nearly all  the time because they were supposed to be going fishing, catching fish  for the fish fries, but very seldom any fish were caught. (Laughter) So, I  took the fish with us. (Laughs)  I had a bunch of catfish one time and so, Buster and Ron Sharp and I  were in   I forget where we were at, having a get-together. But anyway,  it had a building where we could cook the fish and clean them and  everything. So, I got the catfish out. I hadn   t cleaned them like we were  supposed to have, to get them ready to fry. Indy, that   s Ron Sharp, and  Buster and I were in there gutting and cleaning these catfish, or they  were already gutted, but we were cleaning them and cutting them up.  We would cut their heads off and the carcass and throw it out the  window, outside. We noticed some guy out there picking them up. It  was, I better not say because I can   t think of his name, but he was a 4-H  agent from down in the county, not Idabel, but down there around  Idabel. He was a 4-H agent and he was picking up the carcass.  We hollered out the window,    What are you doing out there picking  them up?    He said,    You   re throwing away the best part. I take these  home with me and boil them. They   re good that way        Well then we  won   t throw any more out. We   ll just save them for you.    So, that   s  what we did. We thought that was funny because we were saving the  meat and throwing away the carcass. He liked the carcass part, but I  don   t want to mention any names. (Laughter) But that was one fun time  we had. We   ve had several funs on those get-togethers that we had. It  wouldn   t be statewide. It   d just be by districts, at that time, the northeast  district. Then I was in the southeast district. So, we had fun.  Do you remember what your salary was from the beginning?  First started? I think it was  1800, travel and all.  Per year or month, or what?  Per year  (Laughter) Not a month, per year  Yes, it wasn   t very much.  12  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  That   s why I milked cows and sold the cream and eggs. (Laughs)  And went for promotions when they came open.  Yes, each time it was an increase. We got our new director one time,  Evans, Dr. Evans, and he was saying, later on, how much money people  would be making. Well, it was unbelievable, but he hit the nail on the  head. We were making that much, but also, the cost of living was going  up too. So, it just balanced out. Our salaries were what we were getting  and receiving and the price of everything else just balanced out about the  same so, it didn   t really matter.  It could vary from county to county? Just the same job though.  Yes, it can vary because you get Oklahoma County, Tulsa County,  Carter County, Enid. Those are all, and Muskogee, are all higher paying.  When you started, did you have a goal in mind as to which county you  wanted to end up in?  No, no. I tell you what, I knew what I was doing in 4-H and I knew what  parts of 4-H agent, but I went to Pryor and talked with the 4-H agent  over there. He was testing some soil. He stopped to visit with me. I told  him what I was thinking about, going into Extension, and he said it was  a good job,    Just go ahead and go for it.    So, I did.  No regrets.  No regrets. Don   t look back. Along the line there have been some agents  trying to get me to quit and go do other things, but I said,    No, I   m  staying with Extension.    One thing, Extension has good retirement.  Civil service is a good retirement.  Does it still do that or did that stop?  They still do that.  Still.  Now, some of the agents quit and got big paying jobs, but they didn   t  have that when they retired. So, I   m glad I stayed with Extension.  So, how old were you when you retired then?  Fifty-seven.  13  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  So, young then.  Yes.  And then what did you do?  Okay. (Laughs) Well, my wife didn   t want me to just stay at home so,  she said,    You need another job.    So, I retired on Friday. Monday  morning I went to work at American National Bank in Ardmore. That  was a young bank. They just built it. They held that job open for me  until I retired, which was a year. I helped open a year. So, they kept  asking me,    When are you going to retire? When are you going to  retire?    I said,    Oh, pretty soon.    They said,    Well you better hurry up.     So, I did. I retired on Friday and went to work there on Monday, part-time.  They asked me when I went to the bank,    Are you going to work full-time  or part-time?    I said,    I   ve worked full-time all my life. I want to  go part-time.    So, they said,    Okay,    and they told me what   d I make,  and my hours were from nine to twelve and then one to two. At two  o   clock I was finished. That   d give me time to pull my trailer out at the  lake, Lake Murray, and go fishing. So, that   s what I did. (Laughter)  I worked there six years. Well, I told my wife, I said,    You need to give  up your job.    She had a good job. I said,    Give up your job and retire  because I   ll be getting too old to push the button on the fifth wheel.    She  said,    Okay, in June we both tell our boss at the same time.    So, that   s  what we did. We just loaded up and took off. (Laughter) We sold our  house   well, we didn   t then. It was three years later that we sold our  house in Ardmore and built us a new home up in Grove, up on the lake  up there. Our kids were back here, our grandkids were, and she cried to  come back home. I said,    Okay.    So, we just sold out, came back, and  landed back here.  Full circle then?  Yes, full circle.  Well, in the early days, what was a typical day like for you work-wise?  When did you get up? How early would you start? When would you get  home?  At Woodward, I didn   t do anything but the 4-H job. At eight o   clock I   d  be at the office. When I   d get home, usually at five is when we went  home, but if I had a 4-H meeting or had to take the 4-H kids out for a  judging contest, well, I may not get home until way late at night. As a  14  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  general rule, it was from eight to five, but during fair times, it was from  six to ten.  When the job gets done, huh? (Laughs)  Yes.  So, you really didn   t work full-time. It was full-time and a half.  Yes, sometimes it was. But we didn   t mind it. I enjoyed working with  the kids, 4-H kids. At the beginning some of them were almost as old as  I was. I wasn   t much older than some of them. (Laughs) I think I was  twenty-three.  Well, that   s pretty young. (Laughter) Was the fair different in each  county? Did it have a different feel to it?  Yes and no. Now, some of the fairs had a manager where they had a  carnival and everything. They helped take care of some of the livestock  judges and everything like that. But where they didn   t, it was different.  In some counties, like in Bristow, we had three fairs. Really, the big fair  was at Bristow and I was in charge of that one, of the carnival and  everything. We had a show at Sapulpa and one at Drumright. It was the  same way with the broiler show. We had one at Sapulpa and one at  Drumright, and not at Bristow, a broiler show.  Then if you move on down to Haskell county   no, we didn   t have fairs  down there as such because there wasn   t much money and no place to  have it. What we did there, we had a little fair. The 4-H kids sold stuff to  make money. Whatever money they got, is what we give for prizes to  stuff they brought into the fair. We had a little one-day fair and it  worked pretty well that way. That got it started. I think now, they   ve got  a big building for the fair down there. So, you know, you   ve got to start  somewhere. (Laughs)  Well, once you were county director, how does that job compare to just  being the agent? Is there much difference?  Well, in Carter County I was strictly the county director there and I had  a 4-H agent. So, it made a difference. I worked mainly with the adult  programs and the 4-H worked with the 4-H program. I didn   t interfere  with them unless I needed to help them. Like at the 4-H banquets, I  helped them. Let   s go back to when I was a 4-H agent. I better not call  any names because one of them may still be living. I don   t know. You  had your agent, 4-H, and home economist, and the 4-H program you   re  working all the way through until 4-H banquet night. Then you don   t  15  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  have any say so. The county agent and the home economist took over  there and that made us feel bad, the 4-H. So, I knew it right then, if I  ever got to be a county director, I would not take the program away from  the 4-H after he did all the work. I was taught a lesson right there. I tried  to be fair whenever I got to be the county director and had a 4-H agent.  You started in the    40s. In the    50s, could you see progress or major  changes for each decade?  Oh, major changes from the    40s to    50s, yes. Like I said, that   s when  electricity came about and made quite a bit of change in most the places.  You had hot water, running water, some of them didn   t have too much  running water, but yes, they did. I know my dad had running water after  he got the electricity so, in our home, we put in a bathroom. Before then,  we didn   t have an inside bathroom. (Laughs)  In the programs that you taught, or the classes that you taught, did you  see much change in the topics?  Yes, back when I was in 4-H, an agent in 4-H, we did a lot of judging     going out and judging different places, dairy cattle, beef cattle and even  chickens and all that. Well, they changed. All those programs kind of  went by the way side, more or less. They still have them, but not like  they did. They don   t have field days like they had back then. Most of our  field days are gone. I know they miss that because we had a lot of fun at  those field days.  Doing what? No one   s talked about that before.  Field days?  Yes.  Okay, for example, the first time I was ever here in Sulphur, was back  when I was 4-H agent in Kay County, just moved. I hadn   t been there  long. Dr. Taggert, he brought a 4-H group from Woodward to field day,  which was a Hereford Field Day out here. Robert S. Kerr had it. It was  called Kerr Field Day. This is a big scenery place here in Sulphur, a big  park, a national park. So, we all brought our cots and slept out. That  night, I borrowed a cot because I didn   t have one and I didn   t have  money enough for a regular cot. I borrowed one from my neighbor and it  was an old rotten cot so, I lay down. The first thing I did  imitates  ripping sound    rip  Rip  The next morning, my feet were up here and  my head was up here and there I was, sitting on the ground. Oh, the kids  laughed  They couldn   t help it. They all laughed about it. So, that was  my first deal here at Sulphur.  16  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Talking about our field days, okay. You take four boys or girls, or a mix,  to a judging contest, what we call judging contests. You could enter two  teams, a junior team and senior team. Most of the time we just had our  senior team if there was just one agent. If there were two, we took a  junior team also. It was four members to a team. That was the day we  judged the Hereford cattle out here at the ranch. That was my first, here  in Sulphur.  But for judging contests, the kids judged. Now, the county agents and  the Vo-Ag teacher would bring some too so, we   d divide up. The Vo-Ag  teachers most of the time, were the leaders, the group leaders. We   d  divide into four groups. Us agents, we   d tabulate the results. We had a  runner that would take the card from the group leader, bring them into  us, and we would sort them out and grade them. By the time the judging  was over, we   d have nearly the results from the judging contest. Then  we   d announce who were the winners. So, we worked good together that  way, all the 4-H agents and some of the county directors. They weren   t  county directors then, they were county agents. That   s what they were  called. So, yes we had a lot of fun.  In the    60s and    70s, was there much change?  Oh, well, I   d say probably it did because see, I changed jobs too in those  years. I went from one job to another job. But as far as the people, no.  Normally, there wasn   t much difference in the people, in the    60s,   70s,  and the    80s.  Well,    80s was what they called the farm crisis.  Yes. (Laughs)  That   s about the time you retired, I guess?     84, yes.  Did any of your 4-H-ers go on to be 4-H agents?  Yes, I think one went on to be a 4-H agent. Then he worked in the  college and took judging teams. He was a coach. Now, he is a state  representative in Oklahoma City.  Do you want to name him?  Jerry McPeak. I was his 4-H agent over in Creek County. Yes, he made  good. I really can   t think of others right now that went ahead into  17  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Extension.  That job requires a lot of driving?  Yes, a lot of driving. In later years when I got to be a county director, I  didn   t drive as much because like I said, a 4-H agent did all that then. I  didn   t have to. But back when I was a 4-H agent, yes, I put a lot of miles  on my car. I   d have to trade that every other year. (Laughs) I   d put  40,000 miles a year on one. It was nothing to put that on then, but in  later years I didn   t put that much on them. But yes, we had a lot of fun  down the line. (Laughs)  Had to know a lot of the back roads?  Yes, we didn   t have pavements then, like we do now. In fact, out in  Woodward County the home economist wrecked her car one day, just  driving down a country road. It was sandy. It   s hard driving in sand.  Now, they   re all paved, but then they weren   t paved. Between Enid and  Woodward, there was thirty miles through there by the sand dunes that  wasn   t paved. It was just an open road and there was nothing but sand. It  was hard to drive through there.  Have to have chains to go through the sand?  No, no, we don   t have chains. You   ve just got to drive careful, know  how to drive. You just can   t speed or it will turn you over. That   s where  the automatics come in pretty good out in Woodward County, out in the  sand. You had to watch going out in the country too far because if you  got out in some of those pastures, you wouldn   t get back in with a car. It  was sandy.  Did you typically have a truck?  We had a pickup and a car. The Chevrolet agent in Woodward furnished  us a pickup for the 4-H and then I had my car. The majority of the time I  drove the pickup   well, in Woodward I didn   t drive the pickup because  the agent kept it. (Laughter)  Did you have to do radio shows in each one of the counties?  No, no, I didn   t have one until I went to Carter County. We didn   t have  radios. In Bristow, no we didn   t have any. On just special occasions  maybe, the TV station would come out and do one. Like in Kay County,  the agent and I had to take some sheep. We   d haul some sheep to  Oklahoma City to demonstrate a sheep shearing school on the TV there,  at Oklahoma City. They didn   t come out and do it. We had to take them  18  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  in there on Channel Nine to show them how to shear a sheep. In Kay  County, we had sheep shearing schools for Ed   I can   t think of his  name now. He was the specialist at Stillwater. He   d come up there, have  the sheep shearing schools, and show kids how to shear sheep. We had  second in the nation in shearing sheep.  That   s pretty good. Do they do that today?  I don   t think so. No, I don   t think so. It was the same way with the  tractor driving they used to have. It swept by the wayside. That   s where  the 4-H kids showed their skill at driving the tractor, backing drills  through a certain gate and stuff. They don   t have that anymore.  Would they have to bring their own tractor?  No, a tractor implement dealer would furnish the tractors. I had a kid  from Kay County that won at the Tulsa State Fair.  Usually boys or did the girls compete too?  They could, but they didn   t. It was just boys, then.  That was probably fun.  It was. See, back then, a lot of them were on the farm and had tractors  they had to pull a grain drill with, a grain drill. You had to go through  gates. They   d back down a gate. They had to back a two-wheel  implement back down a lane. All that stuff was part of the driving. Plus,  they had to give maintenance to the tractor before they started. They got  judged on that, too.  Good practice for later.  Yes, it was. They used to have it at Stillwater, then they had it in  counties, and then we   d have it in the state, but I think that has all gone  by the wayside. A lot of it has changed from what it used to be, really.  Big farms, I guess. Bigger tractors.  Yes. Big farms took over all of that. But, we still cooperate with the  ranchers. We help them out with stuff, with the latest experiments from  Stillwater. They still do that.  Did you have anything that was a major challenge or hurdle, something  that just took a lot of work to go around or go over?  19  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  No, I   d be pushing my own if I told about some of the things.  Oh, tell anyway.  Well, it was between Ray Parker. Ray was State 4-H Leader and he  listened to me one day. I said,    Ray,    he wanted to know how he could  get the 4-H kids to read their pamphlets, what they   re supposed to do  and everything. I said,    I   ll tell you one thing, one way. Make it in a way  of a funny book.    They don   t have funny books anymore, I don   t think,  but they did then. Kids would read them. So, he said,    That   s a pretty  good idea.    So, he did. He went back to Stillwater and I think they put  several books out in the form of funny books. It worked pretty well.  That   s a good idea.  Yes.  I understand he did folk dances and that sort of thing.  Yes, he   d come to counties and help with that. Then my 4-H agent used  to do that. He lives at Marietta   Burns. Isn   t that funny? He used to go  to counties and lead 4-H dances and stuff like that.  I doubt that they do that much now.  No, but Allen Burns   Allen used to do that. Allen was an agent over in  Poteau and then he wanted to come back this way so, he got the agent in  Marietta. Somehow you can get crossed with some of the people  sometimes. He got crossed with one or two of them and so, they called  Stillwater and wanted him moved. So, what we did   Bill Parham took  my 4-H agent to Marietta   s agent, and brought Allen up to be my 4-H  agent. So, when I retired he was still my 4-H agent.  It worked out.  It worked out good. Larry Fleck was the one that went to Marietta. He  didn   t stay there too long until it got moved on up. He got to be the agent  at Kay County, where I used to be 4-H agent. His first year Larry had  called me about the problems and I   d talk them out with him. Then after  the first year, he kind of got the drift of it himself. So, he made a good  agent, I think for about three years or four years. Then he had a heart  attack and died. He was a smart guy.  That seems like everybody was crisscrossing.  Yes.  20  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Switching jobs here, there, and yonder.  You knew what you did. Mainly, the Director of Extension pretty well  did it. Sometimes he would allow your district directors to do the switch,  but they would have to go through him for final approval. The district  director knew pretty well what was going on in their district. One time,  there was a home economist that we didn   t think was doing very good.  So, the district director in another district called Parham, wanted to  know about her. They said,    Oh yeah, she   s very good.    He called me, I  said,    Yes, she   s good.    So, he moved her to his district. I saw him later  and boy he gave me the what for  (Laughter) He said,    You storied to  me     (Laughs)    Well, she made you a good agent.    I think she finally  did. So, it worked out okay.  It seems like once you start you pretty much stick with it.  Yes, I had a few home economists quit. One I thought was really good.  Her dad was a specialist and she was a good agent, but she quit because  she wanted to teach school.  Back when you first started, they couldn   t be married and work, right?  Couldn   t be married, that   s right.     40s and sometime even into the    50s, wasn   t it?  Yes and sometimes that made a problem too because the men could be  married. Women were the ones that couldn   t be married. Of course,  sometimes they   d slip around and get caught then they   d fire them   (Laughs) I know one or two that did that way. But they couldn   t be   no,  they couldn   t be married. See, I guess they changed that. Sometime in  the    50s or early    60s is when they changed that.  And at that point, too, couldn   t a husband and wife work in the same  county and be in Extension?  No, no. In fact, I don   t know any of it that got to be that way. A husband  and wife couldn   t be in the same county, even now.  They could still work for Extension, but just be in different counties.  Different counties. Like Ron, see, Ron Sharp, he was a county agent in  Carter County and Debbie was home economist here. It   s in two  different counties.  21  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  And then when you first started, did you have to live in the county you  worked in? Was that a rule?  Yes, yes. He had to live in that county. That was one of the rules. I don   t  know whether it has changed yet or not. It may have changed back down  the line, in the late    70s.  I guess it would be easier if you lived in the county.  Yes, yes. In most places the county seat is usually where the Extension  is and you go over in the center of the county most of the time. There are  some counties where it   s at the edge of the county, but I   d see why you  would have to live in it. Why would you want to live way off and then  be the county agent in that county?  It wouldn   t be good with building relationships either.  Right, you bet. It wouldn   t. You wouldn   t get to work on time.  (Laughter) That   s one thing I believed in, in Extension. I would be there  at eight o   clock and I warned my workers to be there at eight o   clock.  Then they could go do what they wanted to after that, but check-in at  eight o   clock. On Monday mornings, at usually eight o   clock, I always  had a conference set up. We would talk over what we needed to do, what  was bothering them, if anything was bothering them, and what they  needed to do that week. We   d outline our weekly program and we   d  send it to our district director of what we were going to do and so forth.  So, he pretty well knew ahead of time where we   d be unless something  came up and called for drastic change. In Carter County I had three aides  that worked under me, what was called the Big Five Community. So,  they   d meet with us, too, and we got along fine.  Did you have to do narrative reports?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I   d get mine in there pretty early. I think some of them  looked on it and made theirs. (Laughter)  I   m hoping to find some of those older ones. There are some good  stories in there, I bet.  Well, we might get one down in Carter.  I   ll check when I get back. (Laughter)  Yes, we had some pretty good reports. Now, what else can I tell you  about?  22  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  What   s something about the job that the average person might not  know? Something that you were not prepared for. Maybe that   s a better  angle.  Well, I don   t know. Like I said, we had a good program in Haskell  County. When I came to Carter as county director, I used the same  program and started one there. I think it drizzled out, but at one time it  was going. That was our livestock show program. We would start all of  our animals, our beef animals, at the same time at a certain weight. We   d  give awards for the rate of gain, show ring, and then carcass. Then the  top twenty-five we would butcher and get the carcass information off of  them. Then we   d have a program and show the people the different  carcasses. Maybe the grand champion animal would have a poor carcass.  So, you learned what to pick for a good animal, for a carcass.  Well, when you butchered it, what happened with the meat?  People buy it. Those carcasses would sell before you could even turn  around. Everybody wants one or even a half of one. (Laughs)  And then the money goes to the 4-H group or the person that raised it?  It goes to the person that raised it. See, that   s still his animal when he  sells at an auction. They just sell it for donations. They make that  statement, that the kid still owns the animal. Now, if they want to sell it  and you want to buy it for that same price, you can do it. I started over  here at Carter County and worked for the Noble Foundation. They are  very good to work with on something like that. Now, they may do it all,  I don   t know, but it worked out good. Now, with something like that, I  don   t like to toot my own horn very much. (Laughs)  Well, sometimes if you don   t do it, nobody else will. (Laughter)  I   d say one thing. I had a helper by my side all the time if I needed one.  She was really responsive to Extension work. When we would have our  state county agents meeting, she was always there with me.  Did she go to the fair too, the county fair?  Once in a while, yes.  Did you have children? You did, you said.  Three boys.  Were they involved with 4-H?  23  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Oh yes, oh yes, very much so. Now my oldest son passed about two  years ago. His sons, my grandsons, they were involved in showing  animals too. They were very good. The oldest grandson was in 4-H     well, they both were in 4-H, but he really was. He got to go   I forgot  where he got to go to now, Chicago or somewhere, on a trip     Wisconsin. He was a good 4-H-er. Now, he   s got a little boy and girl,  and they   re going to be in 4-H when they   re older.  Granddad could tell them a few secrets.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I hope I can still be around when they get old enough  to be in 4-H. One is six and the other one is four.  Well, when does it start nowadays?  Nine. Well, it used to. I don   t know what it is now. I think it still does,  but they showed animals.  And did they go to OSU?  No, they wouldn   t go on. They wish now they had gone, but they  wouldn   t go to college.  It   s not for everybody.  No, and my middle son was a graduate of Durant  Southeastern  Oklahoma State University . He taught school for two years and quit.  Then he worked and his masters and quit. He didn   t do much of  anything. (Laughs) My youngest son, like I said, he   s a graduate of OSU  and he has his own ad agency in Dallas. He is very successful. He calls  me about three times a day, in the morning, at noon, and at night.  (Laughs)  That   s very nice.  Yes, yes. He misses his momma, too.  It was fun that you all got to do that together though   the 4-H and all of  that was an experience that the family did together.  Oh, yes. Yes, like one time, my middle son when he was in 4-H and we  lived in Bristow, we had our animals down at the fair barns. He had a  good Poland China and about halfway through to the show, he went  down there one morning and it was gone. Somebody butchered it. They  got in there and butchered it, had it for a pig-out I guess. So, we had to  24  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  find him another one right quick and we did, but it wasn   t as good.  Anyway, they had fun showing.  People do that sort of thing though, at the fair? I mean they take a kid   s  project and do that?  Oh, yes, yes. They did my grandson the same way. Yes, they had it out  there at Sulphur out at what they call their Sulphur Show Barn.  Somebody got in there one night and got his.  No way of catching them?  No way of catching them, no.  Do they usually have someone stay at the barn over night?  No, no because you wouldn   t think anybody would bother a kid   s  animal.  Oh, that   s sorry.  But they   re sorry, whoever does that. We never did find out who did it.  We just put a piece in the paper that said,    Watch out because the pig  had been given some medicine that might make them sick.    We hadn   t   (Laughs) We put it in there anyway just for meanness.  Well, you hope it wasn   t a competitor.  No, it wasn   t a competitor. We think we know who it was. I mean, not  who   a group. We think it was a group of the football boys there.  Just a little prank?  No, they wanted to go out and have a pig fry. They knew they were there  and so, one of them probably said,    Let   s get one of them,    and that   s  what they did. Reached through the fence, tore a hole in the fence, and  reached through and got one of them. But, that   s growing up.  Yes.  Kids learn.  They were not 4-H members themselves or they wouldn   t?  No, no. If they had of been   but the boys, they worked at it. When we   d  go to the fair or show, I didn   t know them. I wasn   t around them. My  25  Finchum  Sanford  wife helped them but I wouldn   t help them. She   d say,    You helped the  others  Why don   t you help your own kids?    Well, I didn   t want to be  seen helping them. The people would talk about it so, I wouldn   t help  them.  Play favorites.  An agent from another county that came up and he   d help them. He said,     If you don   t go in there and help them, I   ll help them     So, he got in  there and helped my boys get their hog stuff ready, but that   s experience.  (Laughter) And my little one, when he was showing one time over there,  it was his first show and he was about half sick. I said,    You   ve got to  show your pig, sick or not.    So, he showed it and he won first. He came  over showed his momma, crying, and he said,    I won a blue ribbon      (Laughs)  I can remember his first demonstration. We say a demonstration is  where you   ve got to show how to do something and at the end, can make  them understand to where they can do it then. That   s a demonstration.  Timely speech is where you get up and talk, and tell something timely.  This is his first year in 4-H there, at Bristow, and he said he wanted to  give a demonstration.    Okay, what are you going to give it on?    He said,     I   ll figure it out,    and I said    Okay.    So, he did it himself. He got up  there. He had two pieces of bread. He got a jar of peanut butter and a jar  of jelly. He said,    My name is so and so and I   m going to give a  demonstration on making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.    He said,     The first thing I do when I get home is I get me two pieces of bread,     and he had two pieces of bread,    Then I get my peanut butter,    and he  showed that and put it on there,    And then I get my jelly,    and he put it  on there,    And then I eat it. That   s my demonstration, any questions?     (Laughter) I can just still here that little booger saying that. I kid him  today about it, but that was the demonstration. He showed what to do  and if you went home, you could do that by watching what he did. That  was a demonstration. It was short, but it was a demonstration.  We used to have a lot of demonstrations, usually at a 4-H meeting. Now,  I don   t know if all counties did this or not, but where I was at, in Creek  County and Kay County, at each 4-H meeting you didn   t have but an  hour, sometimes forty-five minutes. So, you had to get it on with. You  had to have a boy   s demonstration and a girl   s demonstration, a boy   s  timely speech, and a girl   s timely speech, a song, a game. You had to  pledge allegiance to the flag. You had to do all of that in forty-five  minutes. Then we had to give our little fifteen minute talk to the kids,  show them something in fifteen minutes. So, you had to get right on with  it.  26  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  In Kay County, we had a contest to see which one could beat the other  one. It got to be that 100 percent, most of them   if they failed to say,     Mr. President    or    Madame President,    you knocked them off one. If  they   re going to get up there and talk, they had to address as president. If  it was a man it   d be,    President,    and then woman,    Madame President.     If they didn   t say that, then you knocked them off a point. It really got  tough. At Kay County, we had set up a program for the winner where  they   d go to Tulsa and go through the zoo, and go through one trip and  another, and maybe the oil company shows how to oil and all that. That  was a trip they had. Of course, we didn   t pay for the trip. They got  money and paid for it themselves, but we just set the trip up for them,  the winner. We got quite a kick out of that.  Always had something to motivate?  Sure, motivate them  Do something  Not just,    Oh, well, I   m going to a  club meeting just so I can get out of class.    A lot of them were that way,  but we wouldn   t let them do that, no. They had to do something. Down  in Haskell County, there were some big ol    boys down there at the 4-H  meeting way down in the country there and the superintendent and the  principal couldn   t do anything with them. They were afraid to.  One time this ol    boy had his knife out and they were making him clean  his fingernails, making a lot noise back there. I went back and told him  to put the knife up. He just looked at me and I said,    Put the knife up or  go outside. I   ll meet you out there     (Laughs) Of course, he   d have  whipped me if I would   ve gone out there, but I bluffed him. Anyway, he  told the superintendent that I was going to whip him. The superintendent  asked,    Yes, I told him that. He was back there with that big, ol    knife,     but I said,    He put it away.    Well, the superintendent said,    Oh, I   ll send  somebody in there to watch from now on.    I said,    Fine.    So, he sent a  lady in there to help control the 4-H kids. Well, she might as well have  been out in the hall. She had no more over them, nothing. But them ol     big boys, I learned one thing. Take an ol    boy and put him as sergeant of  the guard. In other words, make sure everybody else is quiet and I tell  you what, you pick out one of the meanest and make him that, he   s got a  position.  Of respect.  And respect. The rest of them are afraid to do anything with him. So, it  works out pretty good to have that. I had that in several clubs where an  ol    boy was giving you trouble and I   d call him up,    Hey, you know all  these kids, how about you be sergeant of the guard? That means  everybody be quiet.    He   d say,    You want me to make them be quiet?     I   d say,    Yes  That   ll be your job,    and he   d do it,    Yeah, I   ll do that.     27  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  (Laughs) Those boys today, I can still think of some of them. One of  them turned out to be a hairdresser. (Laughter) Isn   t that funny? Yes, the  mean one in the club turned out to be a hairdresser.  There was probably something going on at home.  Oh, yes. He was having problems at home. He was an adopted boy and  he was having problems. I learned that later.  Did they teach you some of this psychology stuff before they send you  out there?  No, no. I just graduated one day, Thursday, and they said,    Monday you  report Woodward,    nothing. I didn   t even have any idea. I know one day  in class, just before the end of the semester, one of my teachers   I forget  who it was now. He   s dead now. Bless his heart. He called me in and  says,    I want you to go over and see so and so, over at the Extension  Building the first chance you get. They want to talk to you.    I said,     Okay.    Well, I had to ask some of them where the Extension Building  was. (Laughs) I didn   t know there at the college. I had been in it to pick  up a bulletin, but I didn   t know it was the Extension Building.  I went over there and found out who   I still can   t think of the name. I  can see him, but can   t think of his name   sent me over there. He asked  me if I would like to go work in Extension. That   s when I said,    Yes, I  might. I   ll think about it.    So, that   s when I went to Pryor and asked that  kid over there what was Extension? What was a 4-H job? They told me  so, I came back and I said,    Yes, I   ll take it.    (Laughs) That   s when I  had to go Woodward, after I graduated. Sorry, I can   t think of his name.  He   s gone too.  There was someone during that time at OSU, Evans was his last name.  J.C. Evans.  Oh, Evans? Oh, J.C. Evans, he was our state director. Yes, he   d come in  there and he was really going to make a change. You could wear what  you wanted to, as long as it was neat and clean. Like, I could wear jeans  and a cowboy   s shirt to work, but when I went to meetings, district  meetings or state meetings, you had to wear a tie. That was what he  expected. So, me and ol    Sharp  Ron , I guess we were one of the good  dressers at the meetings because he and I pretty well had the same kind  of clothes. (Laughs) I mean, back then, I had a blue suede coat jacket.  He did too. I had a different gray one and he did too, and a tan one. So,  we just changed coats and stuff. The rest of them would just have what  they had on all the way through it, but he and I had enough coats and  stuff. We   d change clothes. (Laughs) My wife made sure of that. She did  28  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  the same thing when she went to the state meetings. She had probably,  two or three suitcases full of clothes for a three day meeting. (Laughs)  Want to make a good impression.  Oh, yes. She made a good impression wherever she was at. She got the  state 4-H leader.  What did she show?  This was just a few years ago.  Later.  Well, I had already retired, yes.  She was still active in 4-H?  Helping the 4-H program, you bet, you betcha. Anything she could do  for the 4-H, she would. For the livestock show, she got up a bidding  committee   Bidding Belles. Some of them would never give money to  the show. She got money from them. They   d come out there and we  were going to buy the grand champion. Of course, the grand champion,  usually the banks buy them, but the banks had to pay for them. (Laughs)  They bought the reserve   Bidding Belles. Yes, she was quite active.  Belles as in B-E-L-L-E-S, or as in ringing bells?  B-E-L-L-S. I think that   s the way they spelled it. Bidding Bells. Maybe  B-E-A-L-S, Beals. No, belles. It wasn   t like a cowbell, it was just  Bidding Belles. You know, like women.  That   s why I was thinking like a southern belle.  Yes, that   s right. There were six or seven of them, I believe.  They meant business, huh?  They contributed quite a bit to the show. (Laughs) One ol    gal, she had a  western clothing store. She went and saw her and she said,    How much  you need?    She said,    Well, at least fifty to get in here with us, a  hundred or better.    She said,    Okay.    Told her what it was for and she  gave her the money and said,    Now, you show up out there dressed  western, where you get an advertisement on your store.    So, she did.  That   s how she got them going.  29  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Well, it   s for the kids.  Oh, yes. So, different things like that happening with the timely  speeches and demonstrations. Anyway, they turned around   Carter  County did   for the state 4-H leader and she got it. She had to go to  Stillwater for it, to accept it.  Well, that   s a good memory.  Yes, it is. It really is.  When you say timely speeches, does that mean you were timing them?  No, a timely speech is what it   s called. It is two minutes or less.  Better be quick then.  Yes, two minutes or less.  And do you prepare for that or do you just get a topic when you get  there and you   re told to talk?  Oh, no, they prepare for it.  And practice so they get it within the two minutes?  Oh, yes, yes. A demonstration is fifteen minutes or less. Usually,  thirteen minutes is the maximum.  So, they do some practicing before they get up there then?  Oh, yes, you can   t just get up there.  Can   t wing it.  Another funny thing was, I had a 4-H boy in Creek County. His  demonstration was taking care of bees, getting the honey from the bees.  So, I had a pickup then with a cover over it and so, he took a hive of  bees with him to Stillwater. Well, the bees weren   t supposed to hatch  until a couple of weeks later, but in that pickup it was warm. So, he got  ready to give his demonstration, we go down and get his hive out of the  pickup, and there were bees all in there  He said,    Oh  I can   t take that  up there like that.    So, he got as many bees he could back into the hive  and he closed it up, where they couldn   t get out. He carried it up there to  where he was giving his demonstration and he told them that these bees  were alive in there, and he couldn   t do it exactly like he   d like to. He  30  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  went ahead and gave his demonstration on how to do the honey and  everything. He did all right, but stuff like that.  The funniest thing   now, this was my grandson, my oldest one. He was  giving a demonstration out here on how to filet fish. Well, they didn   t  have any fish so, they went out the night before, him, his momma, and  his little brother. They went out to a pond. Well, they caught two bass,  little bass, about that long. So, they put them on a stringer and went  ahead fishing. When they came back, it was gone. The bass had gotten  loose. They had to fish again. So, they caught a little bass and a perch.  They brought it to the house and he practiced on the perch. They put the  bass in the icebox to keep it until the next day for the demonstration.  Well, the little brother didn   t know, he thought they just left it out so, he  sees it in the icebox. He gets it and puts it in the freezer  (Laughs) He  froze that fish. The next day, he goes to get his fish for the  demonstration and it wasn   t there. So, the little brother tells him that he  put it in the freezer. Well, it was frozen. They tried to thaw it, run water  on it and thaw it and everything as much as they could. They got it  pretty well thawed, but part of the tail had come off.  He gave the demonstration and he told them there what had happened,  but he said,    I think I can go ahead and give you my demonstration.    So,  he did and that lady that was judging   I don   t know who she was   boy,  she asked him a question or two and he answered her and everything.  His momma was standing back over there and that woman said,    That   s  the best demonstration I have ever seen.    (Laughs) She said,    That kid  did a good job on that.    In fact, she had to talk to him later just to see.  She was really interested in that. I taught him how to do that, how to filet  a fish. I learned the hard way. Nobody showed me. (Laughs)  Didn   t fish on the family farm?  No. No, we didn   t raise fish, but we fished. She and I were quite some  fishermen. We   ve caught some good ones and let some good ones get  away. Sometimes we turned some back.  What   s the biggest one?  Biggest one I ever caught was nearly an eight pound bass. He   s on the  wall out in my garage.  Caught him in Oklahoma or somewhere else?  Oklahoma. I caught it down in Lake Murray and you   d be surprised. I  was by myself and I caught it on a little bitty crappy hook. I was crappy  31  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  fishing and this big bass hit my crappy hook and I landed it. I had it  mounted. That was the biggest one I caught. The biggest she caught was  a bass, five and a half pounds. It   s on the wall. The biggest fish I ever  caught was twenty-eight pounds, but that was a catfish.  In Oklahoma?  Yes.  That   s a pretty big size fish.  Yes he was a flathead. He was a pretty good fish. My grandson is a  fisherman, down on the end of the Dougherty, a little place down here in  the country. He   s quite a fisherman and a hunter.  Do you noodle?  He does. (Laughter) Not me. Not me, but he does. Oh, I think he   s  caught up to a sixty-pounder down there, yes. But I don   t do that. Mine  are all caught with a hook. But I don   t do that anymore now. That   s  about all the stories I know, really.  Well, do you remember your last day on that job?  Oh, yes. I can remember my last day. When I retired?  Yes.  Oh, yes. The home economist and the secretary sent letters out to a lot of  them that I was retiring. They were going to give me a party at two  o   clock. Well, the guy that used to be my 4-H agent whose a livestock  specialist at Muskogee, he was there, and one of my leaders in 4-H from  back when I was at Kay County came down to my retirement party. I  was surprised to see him. Then a lot of my friends here in the county  were there. I can   t think of any other agents that came. Of course, Billy  Parham was there   the district director. They had a little party for me  and the 4-H leaders    organization gave me a director   s chair and they  gave me fishing gear. (Laughter) They took some pictures. They   re  around here somewhere, but I wouldn   t know where to look right now.  Did you have to work until 4:30 or did you get to leave early?  I think I left early that day. Well, four, probably four was when the party  was over.  Not too early then.  32  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  No, I left and that was my last day. Of course, a couple days before that,  from Stillwater   I can   t think of his name, the guy that was head of all  of the stuff that came from Stillwater, the county head. He had to come  down and check you all out. So, he checked me all out to see if  everything was there and it was so, he okayed it.  It was with thirty years of   ?  No, it was just the county.  How many years had you been there? Was it thirty years or more?  Thirty-four, I believe.  I was trying to do the math a minute ago and couldn   t keep up with you.  Ten here, ten here, eight and a half     Of course, counting my sick leave and everything, it was thirty-eight  years. My actually working was thirty-five, I believe it was.  Two more and it would be forty  (Laughter) That   s a long time to stay.  Nowadays, that   s a long time to stay at one job.  Yes, yes.  Do you remember your first home visit? Did you do a home visit?  The first home visit, that   d be out in Woodward County   well, yes and  no. (Laughs) I think I do. They got to be good friends of mine out there,  lived at Tangier, which is a little town outside of Woodward. They  invited my wife and I out there for supper and we did. Then they knew  we liked to fish. They told us anytime we   d like to fish, they had a big  pond out there and to come out there and fish and so, we did. We went  out there and fished because sometimes that was our supper. (Laughs) I  don   t think Extension paid enough where we could really afford too  much more. And another little thing that   s funny, I used to have it   I got  rid of it   a little radio, just a little plastic radio. It cost fourteen dollars  and I had to pay it out in payments. Now, you can see what it was back  then.  Turned out to be a good decision though, didn   t it?  Oh, yes. Of course, I had my car before I went to work for Extension so,  I didn   t have to buy a car. (Laughs) I wore it out. (Laughter) My first  home economist out there was Ida May Doodlebaum.  33  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Doodlebaum?  Ida May Doodlebaum, yes. She was my first home economist out there.  Finally, I think she later got married. I don   t know what her married  name was, but that was her name then, Ida May Doodlebaum.  Think she   s still around?  She may be, but her name would be different than the last. I don   t know.  She would probably have been five or six years older than me. That  would make her quite a ways up there. (Laughs) I   m eighty-three.  Maybe, maybe not, then. (Laughter)  So, that   s why I was asking about Dr. Taggart. He was two years older  than me, I think. Ray is the same age, Parker, about the same as I am.  Parker, I think is ninety-three.  Ray?  Ninety-one, ninety-three, ninety-one, maybe.  Maybe ninety-one? Oh, I didn   t think Ray was that old   older than me.  I thought he and I was about the same age.  You   re a spring chicken. (Laughter)  You sure he   s that old?  I   m pretty sure, pretty sure. I   ll double check.  You tell him I said he storied. (Laughter) Tell him you were talking to  me and I said he was about seventy. (Laughter) Oh, Ray.  I   ve asked all my questions. Is there anything else you want to add  before we close it off?  No, that   s about all I can say, but I tell you Extension is a good program.  I   ve enjoyed it and I   ve loved it, but when I retired, I just quit right  there. I haven   t been back to anything or done anything. Right now, I  just don   t want to do anything.  Well almost forty years, that   s enough.  34  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Finchum  Sanford  Yes, yes. When I was in there, I gave them my all. I really did. I wasn   t  one of these that went to the office and checked in and left and went out  to a farm or anything like that because I didn   t have one. I stayed at the  office, strictly Extension.  Put in more than your forty hours a week, most weeks.  Yes, most of the time I did, but I don   t regret it. It was fun. You meet a  lot of people and a lot of sweet people that do things for you. Once in a  while, you   ll find one you can   t please if you give them a golden egg,  but very few.  Well, I think Extension was lucky to have you for those years.  Well, thank you. I enjoyed it.  Thank you for having me today.  You bet, thank you.  -------  -------
