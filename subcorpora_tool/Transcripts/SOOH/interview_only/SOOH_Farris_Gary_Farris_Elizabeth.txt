 Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Sunday, November  27, 2011. I   m in Norman, Oklahoma, at the Farris    house. Gary, you   re  Cherokee. You currently work for the Federal Public Defender   s Office  here in  Oklahoma City . Elizabeth, you   re Otoe, and you work in retail.  I know you both have artistic inclinations. You also started your own  gallery several years ago in Norman, but today I   m here to speak to you  as collectors of Native art, who also happen to be Native, themselves.  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Thanks for inviting us to.  We   ll start out with Gary, where you were born and where you grew up.  I was born in Twin Falls, Idaho, and I grew up a little bit here and a little  bit there. My dad was in the service, in the Army all my adolescent life.  I left home when I graduated from high school in Wurzburg, Germany,  and started my own life after that. Went to college at the University of  Oklahoma is where I started.  Wow, from Germany to Oklahoma.  All by himself. There was nobody else. He had no family in the United  States.  How about you, Elizabeth? Where were you born?  Originally from Tulsa. Wonderful place to be brought up. A lot of art, a  lot of Indian happenings, so it was a great place to grow up, really, being  Indian.  Went to public schools there in Tulsa, pretty much?  5  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Public schools, right. Did take art lessons at Philbrook and enjoyed that  as a child. It kind of got me interested. I always liked art classes, but it  really got me interested in major art, you know, Renaissance art and  Baroque and things like that. I   d never experienced that before, so it was  great.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad was a petroleum engineer, and my mom was a homemaker. She  stayed home and took care of us.  And your father was obviously in the service.  Yes, career Army. My mother was also a homemaker. She had part-time  jobs from time to time. Well, she sold Tupperware, (Laughter) and  enjoyed it and sold more plastic stuff than I   ve ever seen. I mean, she   d  fill a house with it. It was kind of fun to watch her do that.  What are your earliest memories of seeing Indian art, Gary?  Oh, gosh, since I really wasn   t around it too much growing up, it was  pretty much after I met Elizabeth, and we started collecting right away.  Even before we got married, we started putting things together and had  certain things in our apartments, and it just grew from there. I mean, it  was insatiable. We just had to keep getting it. It was kind of crazy.  How about you, Elizabeth? What are your earliest memories of seeing  Indian art?  My grandparents    home. They traveled a lot. They went out to the  Southwest, so they had beautiful rugs and pots they collected. Of course,  my mom had a few things. I remember Acee Blue Eagle as a child.  Noticing his paintings?  Noticing that, right. It was wonderful, all the different colors and the mix  of things. I enjoyed it.  That   s great. Did either one of you have any extended family members  who were artists?  My oldest brother was quite an artist but never developed it, never  pursued it, but he could draw just about anything just by looking at it.  It   s unfortunate that he didn   t take advantage of that. That   s about the  only one I can think of.  6  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  In my family, my grandfather   my grandmother was full-blood Otoe,  and my grandfather was a British subject. He painted landscapes and  still lifes, and I grew up watching him paint and draw, and he taught me  some things. It was always fun to watch him work. I know some Indian  artists that were kind of inspired by my grandfather, like Walt Harris. He  said he used to watch him paint when he was a young boy. One of my  older brothers was an artist, as well, but didn   t really pursue it, just kind  of played.  When you say your grandfather was English, he was an English citizen.  He wasn   t an American citizen.  Yes, he came here as a young man. Matter of fact, my  grand parents  met at Stewart Nevada Indian School. They both taught there and had to  take the train to California to get married because it was illegal to marry  Indian if you were white in Nevada. So they had to take the train to  California to get married. But he was very talented. I have his  landscapes in my bedroom.  You mentioned you had some art experiences in primary and middle  school, lessons that you took at Philbrook. Also, in public school, were  you very interested in art?  I like fashion illustration and took all the art. I   ve done so many color  wheels, color charts, which has served me well because I   m a makeup  artist now. I use the color charts in what I do now, so it   s great. Just use  the face as a canvas.  How about you, Gary? Any interest in art, yourself, when you were  younger?  No, not really. When I was older, I worked with my older brother who  was a master carpenter, and he taught me a lot of things. I like to do  woodwork. I make a lot of cedar boxes for people, and this bookshelf  behind me, I made it. I   ve made a lot of things, and I enjoy doing that a  great deal.  You went to high school in Tulsa?  Yes, Will Rogers.  You were in Germany for high school?  Wurzburg, Germany, for high school.  When and how did you meet?  7  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  In Tahlequah at Northeastern  State University .  I transferred from the University of Oklahoma. Both my parents were  pretty ill at that time, and Tahlequah was much closer to Vian, which is  where they were living, than Oklahoma City or Norman. I transferred  there to be able to help them as much as I could, and we met while we  were both going to school there.  What were your majors? What were you majoring in, Gary?  My major was biology, qualified me to be unemployed. (Laughter)  I was kind of interested in just liberal arts and parties. (Laughter)  You   ve already mentioned that when you were dating, one of the places  you went, I guess, was art shows?  When we decided to get married, or live together, we started collecting  posters, and we started collecting Indian. We both were kind of  interested in our backgrounds, and we pursued that a lot. Tahlequah is a  great place to pursue that. We started collecting posters and then prints,  and then that moved into originals as soon as we could afford them.  And are we talking the    70s, here, early    70s?  Seventies, right.  Of course, that was a great time for Indian activism. Were either of you  guys involved in any     Well, my brother was. We were in an Indian student organization, and  that   s kind of how we met, right? We were not really activists, but it was  around, and it was an exciting time. Really was exciting.  Right, and art was doing a lot for positive Indian identity.  Absolutely.  What was the first art show you went to or the first place when you  purchased your first original together?  That would   ve been a little art show in Tulsa, and it was Walt Harris.  He   s a distant relative of ours. It was a small peyote piece, and it was  something that we could afford, and it was attractive. As students, we  just jumped in with two feet, never looked back. (Laughter)  8  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  Now was this at a gallery or an art show?  This was at an art show.  Okay, so you were buying it from Walt.  Right, absolutely.  How did you make that leap, though? I think you mentioned it was  seventy-five dollars. Is that right? That   s quite a bit of money for  students.  Right. For students it was, and thought about it a lot.    Should we have  it?    (Laughs) We knew it was the right thing. After that, we used to go  to a lot of galleries and look and look and look. I think our big    A-ha     moment was when we had seen Bennie Buffalo   s Girl on a Horse at a  party at someone   s home, and then we saw it at the Philbrook at an art  show     At the Indian Annual?     at the Indian Annual. Farris was in Alaska. He was working for the  Cherokee Nation. He was in Alaska. I started making phone calls. I was  curious if it was available and who had it. I found out it was available,  and I found out who had it. I called them, and they said,    Yes, you can  put it on layaway.    (Laughter) Since you were gainfully employed after  getting out of school     She called me and said,    I found the painting.    (Laughter) I knew what  she was talking about. I knew exactly what she was talking about.  From the very beginning, were your tastes similar in art?  Yes.  We both would zero in on something. I   ve never chosen something that  you didn   t like. We both like things the same, and it   s amazing because  our tastes     Well, it   s fortunate. It   s not only in art, too. We like old cars. We like  old houses. We like old antique furniture. It   s very similar tastes.  It was fortunate that we met.  That   s a real blessing, for a couple. (Laughter) Were you immediately  9  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  drawn to painting more than other media, or did it just depend on the  piece?  Mostly easel art, mostly paintings went into our collection. We don   t  have much of anything else, but we   ve kind of tinkered with other  media, as well. We have some baskets. We have a little pottery, a few  rugs. Don   t know much about some of the other things, and that   s one of  the reasons we   ve stayed away.  That   s true. We knew what we liked as far as paintings, but working for  Doris  Littrell , she kind of encouraged you to learn. I did learn a lot  from her about rugs and pots, which I did not know before, so I was very  hesitant to buy anything I didn   t know about. So I did learn a lot when I  was working there. That helped us buy what we did buy in the way of  rugs and pottery and baskets. I knew jewelry very well before that from  my mother. I have always collected Indian jewelry, but the other things,  we were a little hesitant until we   I even learned about kachinas from  her. I   m not a big kachina person, but it   s kind of nice to know, before  you buy, what you   re looking at.  This is Doris of Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery. How long had you been  collecting before you went to work for Doris? Did you meet her first as a  collector?  We met her first as a collector when we were young, very young. She  also allowed us to put things on layaway, which we did do. We worked  with her out of state. We had some art shows in North Dakota, and she  helped us with that. Then, when we moved back to Oklahoma, I was at  loose ends. You had a job with the Indian Affairs Commission, and I did  not have a job, so I worked there for a short time. The whole time I  worked there, it was like an education. It was great. She encouraged that,  and you could ask her anything. The other thing that was great about  being there is that you would see some piece come in that was really a  museum piece. It was there. You got to actually see it. Of course, it was  gone, like, in a couple days, but you got to see pieces that you wouldn   t  normally get to see, just like if you were at a shop or anything,  something that was in your hands, you got to see it. That was an  education, really. I really enjoyed that.  You mentioned you were doing some art shows in North Dakota. Were  you selling art?  We actually were. It was this fundraiser kind of thing for a student  organization. She would help us with that, and it was great.  For your Indian student organization?  10  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Right.  I ran a program in North Dakota called Indians Into Medicine. Basically,  we recruited students from the reservations, brought them to campus, got  them through their undergraduate work and into medical school, get  them trained, and then send them back to the reservation to provide  healthcare. These auctions and things that we would have   we had an  annual auction up there for Indian art. They never had anything like that  before. They have an incredible number of American Indians in North  Dakota, but it amazed me they didn   t have any shows or     They didn   t have galleries or anything.  Right, nothing, so we came to Doris with an idea, and she said,    Take  what you want.    I mean, we loaded up a van with thousands of dollars     worth of art. It was just from our knowledge of her when we were  younger.  And from your position as collectors, it made you think this would be a  good fundraiser.  Right, and it was. It was incredible.  It was. It was great. When we came back home, I think we had  something on layaway at Doris    until she closed.  Most of our lives. (Laughter)  It became a way of life.  So the art show would   ve happened, approximately     In the early   90s.  I went up there in    86. I think we started in    88. Something like that,  wasn   t it?  In    89, something.  So four or five years after that, then we did it every year.  Wow.  It got to be something the community anticipated, and they began to ask,     Well, when is the show going to begin?     11  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  It was fun.  It was well received, and it raised a lot of money for the program.  How did that also feed into your collecting, do you think?  Well, we actually got to see   to me, we started seeing younger artists,  different styles. For so long, I think especially you, Farris, liked  traditional Indian art. I kind of branched out, and he came along. I don   t  know. Maybe you liked it, as well. I started looking at more abstract  things and different things, and I think that helped our collection grow a  little bit just by seeing more things. We just didn   t zero in on one thing.  It was great.  I still like traditional. (Laughter)  He does. He does, but you   ve grown so much. It   s amazing, really.  Another thing that it did for us, though, and did for the community of  North Dakota, basically, was it encouraged artists who had never shown  before, who had just maybe painted for themselves, to bring art to the  auction, and we began to include that along with the art that we would  get from Doris or wherever. Toward the end of that thing, we were  getting art from all over the United States. It was really cool. We   d get  some incredible pieces that we would be able to bid on, as well.  It was fun. Then we came home, and I was so glad to come back to  Oklahoma.  That was, like, the mid-   90s, maybe?  That was mid-   90s, yes. Been here since.  Do you think collecting is primarily an emotional impulse, or is it partly  intellectual? What do you think about that act of collecting, when you  decide     For me, it   s an emotional response. We buy what we like. If it turns out  that it   s valuable and will continue to increase its value as we have it,  that   s a benefit, but it   s not one that I think about when I purchase a  piece. It   s emotional for me.  I think so. I think so. It has to really speak to you, and when it speaks to  you, it   s something that you want to take home and live with. What I  like is sometimes spending time by myself in the morning, just sitting  12  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  and enjoying being around some of the pieces. I know your office is the  same way. His office is like a little gallery.  I have twenty-two pieces in my office. It   s not that big an office.  (Laughter) What I like to do here is just sit in a different place when I  come in this room because each time you sit in a different place, you get  a different view. I mean it   s just incredible, and I enjoy it. It   s very  peaceful.  You   re not just decorating. There   s something else happening.  Right. It   s not like,    That goes with my couch.    We never buy like that.  Or    This goes with the rug.    No, it   s not a decorating thing. It   s a piece  of art. It   s its own entity, and you just let it have a space in your life.  We   re enriched by it.  Right, very much so, and our children are collectors now, which is great.  I was going to ask that. That   s great. You   re passing that on.  In our den, there   s a big coffee table, and there   s a drawer in it. There   s a  list in that drawer. Every Christmas when the kids come home, they get  to pick a piece from our collection and add it to their list that they get to  have when we   re     If we still have the piece. (Laughter)  It   s kind of interesting to watch that grow and watch how their tastes     How they choose.  How their tastes are evolving. So that   s their Christmas wish or  tradition.  It   s kind of a fun thing, right. The oldest chooses first, and it   s  interesting to see what they choose.  Would you say your focus was on living artists, or did it just kind of  depend on the piece?  Depended on the piece. We have both deceased artists and living artists,  young and old. That Ishkotin right there is just kind of fun and crazy.  He   s a young kid, but he   s been showing     13  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  At the Heard since he was fifteen.     for years.  What   s his tribal affiliation?  He   s Navajo  and Chiricahua Apache . That   s way something that   Gary  would   ve not looked at a few years ago. (Laughter)  I   m not repulsed by it now. (Laughter)  It   s exciting.  You might   ve already addressed this, but, again, coming from a Native  background, how do you think that impacted your collecting,  specifically?  Well, color is wonderful. I   ll say this quickly. It   s no reflection on her, I  don   t think. I had a Pendleton coat, and a non-Indian friend who wanted  a Pendleton coat. She said,    I wish I could find a Pendleton coat that was  all in browns and beiges.    I   m like,    Well, then it wouldn   t have been a  Pendleton. It wouldn   t be an Indian blanket. Then it would just be   go  to Dillard   s     (Laughter)  For one thing, we embrace color, and we   re not afraid of anything. I  think some people are a little,    Oh, I don   t have room in my house,    or,     Where would I put that?    or,    I have one piece on my wall.    That  would never even enter my mind that we didn   t have a place for it. We  would just find room for it.  We   ll find a place, yes. There   s a certain relationship to the pieces that  we have, I think just because they   re culturally significant to us. We   re  both very proud of and involved in our different cultures.  And our clans.  That really shows up. She   s buffalo clan, and I   m wolf clan, so you   ll  see a lot of buffalos and wolves.  That   s a strong theme throughout this household. (Laughs)  Right.  You mentioned layaway as being important because that enabled you to  buy pieces that you wouldn   t normally have had access to. What   s the  frustrating part about layaway?  14  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  When we had a gallery, (I will say this) we had a layaway. If you   re  interested in it and we hear from you every once in a while, great. We  never had a layaway that was three months because that doesn   t always  happen for people. As long as we knew someone was interested, we kept  the piece for them. I think with layaway, the way we did it, with people  that really kept you on, it kind of made us anxious to get the piece.  That was always there whether or not it took us three months or three  years.  For us, it was great if people worked with us. I think, for the most part,  most gallery owners will work with you, which is great for young  collectors. If they know you want it, it   s a wonderful way to build a  collection.  The frustrating thing is, of course, not having the piece.  Right. You want to get it as soon as you can.  Sometimes if you get halfway through the payment, they   ll give you the  piece and you can have it, but most of the time they want their money  before you get the piece. I understand that, but that   s the frustrating part  about it.  I   ve worked with women before. They   ll sit around and talk about  redoing, repainting, or re-carpeting, which is great, but I always think of  a collection as a movable feast, you know, Hemingway. If we lived here,  great. If we lived someplace else, we would just take it all with us, and  it   d be wonderful wherever we were. That   s what I like. We take what  we love, and it would be our home wherever it was. I don   t care what the  wall color is or the carpet or whatever.  However, we usually get to this, though. (Laughter)  We usually get to basic white.  Shows off those colors.  It does.  So you will move pieces if a new piece comes in. Does that involve some  juggling or rethinking?  Sometimes, but we do hang much like a gallery does, from floor to  ceiling. If we find another piece, it might just go there in that room.  15  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  The reason there   s a hole there is that some of that is at William and  Mary  College  now. We have some holes because of that.  We have   what did they borrow? Five pieces?  Five. Five pieces.  Five pieces that are touring. You want to tell a little bit how that came  about?  There was a Native American conference in Norman a couple of years  ago, and a representative from William and Mary College was here, and  she came to our gallery. She just kept coming back. The conference was  five days, and she was there at least once a day. She ultimately bought a  very, very nice piece from us by Kelly Haney. As soon as they heard, or  as soon as this plan to have a show at William and Mary began to  develop, she contacted us, and she asked if she could borrow some of  our pieces. She was very specific about what she had seen. Then we told  her some of the other things that were available. She said,    Oh, I   d like  that, too,    so we wound up lending them five pieces.  These are Kiowa pieces. Is that right? I can   t remember. Are they more  traditional?  They   re more traditional. They were doing a show that did speak to that.  They were Kiowa Five and also Acee Blue Eagle. It was kind of the  Kiowa school. The Kiowa Five and the Bacone School is what they were  concentrating on. I   m sure, a lovely show. I wish I could   ve gone out to  Virginia to see it.  When you purchased multiple pieces from the same artist, when you  began to do that, was the bar a little bit higher for you in terms of how  the piece had to speak to you, or were you conscious of any    This is  representative of this artist, therefore I need something that   s unusual  for them   ? How did you think about that?  I think it   s all just gut feeling. We like it, or we don   t like it. That being  said, like with Mirac Creepingbear, we have a very early piece, and we  have one (that   s one of the pieces we   re going to talk about, I think) of  his later pieces. Then we have a piece that is just wonderful, and it   s  very touching. It   s nice to see them grow, and it   s nice if you can find  early pieces like the Virginia Stroud we have in the hallway. It   s an early  piece, and it shows her growth and her moving into what she does now.  I don   t think we were like,    Oh, we need early pieces, and then we need  16  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  a later piece.    It   s just we see it, we like it, and it happens to be an  earlier piece, or it happens to be a later piece of the same artist. Their  style evolved, and we were right along with them. Like Merlin   s  Little  Thunder , when we see a piece of his, if it speaks to us, we just     I don   t know if you   ve heard of that artist or not. (Laughter) We have  several of his, and they   re all incredible. We like them because of what  they are, not because they go with something else or it   s a different  period in his painting. They just speak to us. You   ll have to tell him if  you ever meet him. (Laughter)  Right. You mentioned that Philbrook Annual was one show you faithfully  attended for several years. What was that like? I guess that was towards  the end, maybe.  Right. It was very exciting. We saw some artists there that I didn   t know  about, so that was exciting.  That was the fun part.  It was very new, and you could see where a lot of young artists were  going. Before that, we really had been kind of traditional, and we like  traditional things, anywhere from the Kiowa Five and that whole   and  we just started really looking at things differently. It   s interesting, and  it   s fun to see the political statements that young artists put in things. It  really, I think, opens your mind.  What was one especially memorable encounter you had at the Annual  with an artist or     Seeing the Bennie Buffalo piece.  I think that was one, seeing that piece and knowing that we     That piece you   d been tracking. (Laughs)  We had, and it   s so weird that it just continued to pop  up .  It was there, and it was like it needed to come with us.  We thought,    Okay, we have to have that piece.     When we were there, it was after the opening, so there were no artists  there. We were there on a Sunday afternoon. We were living in  Tahlequah at the time, and we were visiting Tulsa, my parents, and  decided to go for the show. Philbrook   s wonderful, anyway, and the  17  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  show was very exciting. I don   t know. It was speaking to us, and we  hunted it down.  I know you have attended Red Earth Indian Arts Festival faithfully, too.  Was there any competitive bidding for any those pieces? As collectors,  have you ever engaged in that?  At an auction? Yes, we have. A couple of different auctions, auctions  that come here in Oklahoma City. We have bid for a lot of things. It can  be very interesting. I found out recently   I was at a party, and I had a  lady say,    You know, I bid against you at an auction. I don   t know  anything about the artist, but I won because I knew you were bidding,  and I wanted the piece that you were bidding on. But I don   t know  anything about the artist.    I said,    You don   t know anything about the  artist?    She said,    Yes, his name starts with a P,    and she said it was a  horse drawing. I said,    Pahsetopah? You bid on the Pahsetopah?     (Laughter) Anyway, it was funny, but she got it.  Not good information for you to hear.  No. So I thought,    Hmm, I   m going to have to start having somebody  else bid for me.    It was so funny. She said,    I bid, and I won it.    I said,     Well, good, it   s a good piece.    That can be interesting. I don   t know.  It   s a lesson learned.  How did you research your artists, or did you?  The Pahsetopah I wanted was from being in Tulsa and that whole  school. There   s a whole different kind of thing there than there is here.  It   s all great. I think we just like the colors and the style and the piece,  and it doesn   t really matter.  You don   t have to know a lot about the artist?  No, but we find out after we buy the piece.  After we see the piece, we   re like,    Who is this person?    Then we start  researching.  We purchased several David Williams pieces. At the time, he was the  only one we had multiples of. We were trying to buy different pieces  from different artists, and then we met him while we were there. That  does make a little bit of difference, I   ve found, when you know the  artist. He was such a nice man. He sang, and he taught, and he was an  artist and a sculptor. He was just an incredible person, actually.  18  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Kind of like Doc Tate, you know, they   re charming, charming people.  So we enjoyed his pieces even more, I guess, if that   s possible.  We would find something we liked, and then we would research the  artist, but it   s nice to meet the artist. If they happen to be at an opening,  that   s just a double pleasure because you   re seeing the piece and meeting  the artist and finding out about them. I think it does make a big  difference whether it   s Indian art or Western art. We tend to have one or  two pieces of Western art but very little because we really have more of  an affinity for Indian art just because of our background. However, you,  in your office, have a little bit of Western, like Bev Doolittle, just  because it   s a fun thing.  Well, it   s Western, but it has an Indian image. It   s interesting. Are you  familiar with Bev Doolittle?  Yes.  I was just intrigued by it, so I have two of them.  Hidden images.  I think people come in his office, it   s a game like Where   s Waldo?  How do you think your tastes in collecting have changed over the years?  You   ve kind of addressed this a little.  We   ve definitely gone from very, very traditional to very, very abstract.  I don   t know exactly how   when we see a piece, we just like it. It just  speaks to us. It   s not like,    We   re looking for an abstract today.    It just  happens that we like it. We still find traditional that we like, often.  Because we collect   well, we   re interested in deceased artists. Most of  those were traditional artists. We just like them. To this day, that   s how  we choose a piece. We have to like it, and we like it usually  immediately. If something doesn   t grow on me, particularly, if I don   t  like it at the beginning, I   m not going to like it tomorrow.  It   s like broccoli.  Right. (Laughter) If I don   t like it in the beginning, I   m not going to like  it, and I just move on. That   s how we continue to choose our pieces.  It has to hit us. We pretty much see something, and if we   re not in the  same place, we   ll say,    Did you see that          Yes, I saw it     It   s  19  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  fortunate that we both usually like the same pieces, so that   s great.  What was the one purchase that you felt was sort of a lucky turn of  circumstances?  One of them was when we were living in Tonkawa. Heard a knock on  the door, and this guy came to the door. Later found out his name was  Lyle James. He   s an artist. He said,    I heard you buy Indian art.    I said,     Well, yes, we do.    He had a couple pieces he wanted to sell. I guess he  was hitting on hard times, and they were very reasonable prices, so we  bought them. That, when it just comes to you, I think is incredible. I like  that, although we like to do the search, as well. That sort of fell in our  laps, and we just love the piece.  I like to go to auctions when someone   s not watching what I   m bidding  on. (Laughter) I find a piece that someone has overlooked, and it   s a  fairly important piece. That happened to me, I don   t know, I guess a year  or so ago. I found a really great  Stephen  Mopope that I thought,    Well,  surely somebody is going to bid against me on this.    They did to a point,  and I was stunned when I was able to get it because the colors were  incredible. I was very fortunate to get it, but I was also very surprised. I  was looking around like,    Is this real?    So, sometimes, that to me is      It   s exciting.  Yes, it   s very exciting.  We got a Fred Beaver like that, too. Nobody bid on it, and I thought,     Oh, my God      Those are fun things.  Have you done most of your collecting in-state?  I would say in-state.  Mostly here, but everywhere we   ve gone we like to have a piece, at least  a piece, from that area, too.  Like North Carolina, we have something from North Carolina. We  encourage people to think of Oklahoma as a wonderful wealth of artists.  I have people all the time say,    I went to Santa Fe, and I bought this.     This is better than Santa Fe. People that live here show there. I said,     You could buy it here.    It   s like,    Shop locally, please. Support your  artists here. They   re from here.    I don   t know. It   s kind of a pet peeve  we have that people feel like they have to say,    I went to Santa Fe.     20  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Oklahoma, to me, is better.  Because it   s everywhere. It   s not just in Santa Fe. It   s in Tulsa. It   s in  Oklahoma City. It   s in Tahlequah. It   s everywhere. They just haven   t  taken advantage of it, and I don   t know what the deal is. Status, I guess.  You did mention, and I see a couple of sculptural pieces here and there,  you were attracted to wall art from the beginning, but eventually you did  pick up a little bit on sculpture. What were some considerations with the  stone sculpture or wood sculpture?  As soon as we saw some of the pieces, like this Sherman  Chaddlesone ,  I just had to have it.  Who is also a painter.  Right, he   s also a painter. Had to have it. We both agreed we needed it,  so we put that on layaway. That   s another Doris purchase. Most of them  are that way: we just see something that we really like. We do have  some sculpture we like. Some people really, really love sculpture, and  they have a lot of it. We have a nice, small collection of that, but I  wouldn   t say we are heavy-handed in sculpture. It just has to speak to  you.  Again, after we bought the piece, we did a little research on Sherman.  Found out that Allan Houser had pretty much named him to be his  replacement in the sculpture world, which was kind of cool, but we  didn   t give that any consideration. We saw this piece, and it   s incredible,  and we said,    We   ve got to have that,    and later found out it was  Sherman   s.  And Allie, his wife     Yes, she   s wonderful, too.     we have some of her smaller pieces. It   s exciting. What they can bring  out of a piece of alabaster and marble, it   s just amazing.  In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed, requiring that  artists have proof of enrollment or be certified by their tribes. Did you  notice the way that impacted galleries or artists? Did it impact your  collecting?  It   s important for us to have American Indian artists in our collection. I  wouldn   t say,    Oh, I wouldn   t have that because they   re not       I  wouldn   t take something out of our collection that we love, but I  21  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  wouldn   t seek out artists who aren   t. We would seek artists who are  Indian and who are affiliated with the tribe. It   s important, I think.  It is important.  It   s something that   s very important to us. That being said, we have a  couple pieces by people who are not affiliated and people who don   t  have their card, but not very much. Most of it was when we were young,  and it   s more sentimental.  Do you continue to collect at the same pace? Have you slowed down a  little?  No.  We haven   t slowed down. (Laughter) That   s pretty incredible, too. I  When are we going to stop? But we can   t.  Would you say once a month, maybe, you make a trip to see what   s out  there?  We   re always looking.  Always, we never really stop. Just always looking. Whether it be in  galleries or on the internet, private, we just always look. We are always  looking.  People still call us from time to time, much like that kid that came by the  house.  Right, exactly.     We have these pieces. Are you interested in buying?    We   re kind of  drawn into it if we don   t do it ourselves.  People find you. You opened a gallery, yourselves, a few years ago. That  has been sometimes a path that collectors take, not often, but that   s often  the next step. What do you think appeals to collectors about opening a  gallery?  I think the camaraderie, being around artists, being around the art. It was  wonderful. One of the reasons we did temporarily close is our son is in  school. When he finishes, hopefully we   ll reopen again. We still have a  very small gallery downtown that is by appointment, but no one is there  every day. It   s by appointment, so we still are there. When we go down  there, I don   t know, I love it. It   s exciting because  of  a lot of young,  22  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  young, interesting artists.  We have people call us all the time. The reason we kept the little gallery  downtown is we kept having people come to the house,    Do you have     Can we see       That got to be kind of freaky, not uncomfortable, but it  was better to say,    Yes, we can meet you. We have a small gallery  downtown.    It   s in a law firm, so it works out well for us. We are  continuing. I think collectors do that because they live to be around it.  However, I did learn something from Doris in that you do have to decide  whether you want to be a dealer or a collector, and I will say she was     She was 100 percent dealer.  She was 100 percent dealer. She could part with something. You do  have to make that decision. I did that one time. I had a lovely piece of  jewelry that my husband had given me, and somebody was very  interested in this certain thing, and I said,    I   ll find one for you.    Well,  that being said, I couldn   t find that kind of piece for them, a sugilite. I  looked and looked and looked. So I had to sell her my piece because I  told her I was going to get it. You have to make that decision. Are you  going to be a collector or are you going to be    I did it, and it does sting  a little. It makes you stronger.  When we opened, most of the inventory was from our collection. Then  the longer we were open, the more we were able to buy from other  collections or other artists or     We had our collection which was mainly either established artists or  deceased artists, and we had all these wonderful young artists. That was  just so great. They   re energetic and interesting and fun. We did the live  paints. The live paints were just the most wonderful things, to see these  guys knock out a canvas in two hours. It was great. They were just  young, fun people, and to see their work done, it was exciting. That   s  really what I think I enjoyed the most about having a gallery is watching  the new guys come in and see what they have to do. It was great. We  just keep collecting.  What do you see as the future for Native art?  Exciting. They   re saying a lot with their work. They   re saying a lot of  interesting political things. They   re doing some wonderful things, and  they   re doing affordable, fun things I would   ve not thought about.  They   re doing photography with art. They   re doing decoupage. They   re  doing just really interesting things. They   re making things affordable for  people who want to start collecting, which I love.  23  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  And at the same time, they   re still recording our culture, and I find that  exciting and necessary. I   m glad they   re still doing that.  They are, and they   re doing a wonderful job. It   s wonderful. I think  being around artists, it   s one of the most exciting, interesting things. It  makes you feel alive. It really does.  What kind of advice would you give to another collector of Native art?  Buy original and buy large.  Don   t bid against me. (Laughter) Buy original, buy large, and don   t bid  against me.  That was Doris    mantra.  That was Doris   . Buy original, buy large, unless it   s a miniature.  Unless it   s a miniature. We don   t have all originals. Most of them are.  Sometimes if I like an image and someone already has the original and  there are reproductions available, I   ll buy the reproduction because I am  interested in the image. You can   t always have the original, and for us  it   s a good thing because we   d be in the poor house, even more so than  we are.  The other thing I would advise is not to worry about whether you have  space on your walls for something. I   ve heard that so many times. I  can   t even understand that. When someone says,    I don   t have any space  for that,    I can   t even imagine that. There   s always a place for  something. You can find a home for it, believe me.  And if not, we   ll do it for you.  Yes, we   ll find a place for you. We   ll help you hang.  If you were asked to help someone build a collection, is there anything  you would add to what you   ve said?  I   d just jump in with two feet and do it. You can talk about it, you can  want things, but if you don   t just do it   you don   t want to think,    I  should have. I could have. I wish       You have to do it. You just have to.  You don   t want to regret anything.  No, and I think you have to buy, mostly. Don   t worry if it   s going to  appreciate in value or that it   s going to depreciate. If you like it, that   s  what is important, to me anyway. If you don   t like it, why would you  24  E. Farris  Little Thunder  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  E. Farris  buy it, anyway? I find people doing that because they think it   s going to  appreciate in value and then they can sell it at a profit. I never think of  that. Just buy with your heart, buy with your emotions.  And don   t think about where you   re going to put it. It   ll find a place.  We   re going to look at a couple of your pieces here in a minute. Is there  anything we   ve forgotten to talk about or anything you   d like to add?  I don   t think so.  No, I think we   ve probably just said it.  Let   s take a look at what you   ve got here. This is a Mirac Creepingbear  piece.  This is a piece we got from Doris, Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery.  It   s called Yellow Horse.  The colors are magnificent. Everything about it is just magical. As soon  as we saw it, we knew we had to have it. She was kind enough to work  with us on this. I understand it   s one of the last pieces that he did. It was  in a group of things he did toward the end of his life, so we   re fortunate  to have it.  A real celebration when you brought this home.  Very much so. Very much so.  Except our youngest child because that was his college education.  (Laughter) No, everybody loves that piece.  This is David Williams, and it   s one of our favorites. We knew of David  when we were young students and bought a piece of his as soon as we  could afford to. We tracked this piece down because we liked it. We  bought it from a collector who had several of David   s pieces, and she  was kind enough to let us put it in layaway. We   ve always admired the  Kiowa Fancy Dancer and love it. Holds a special place in our hearts.  David is   what is he? Tonkawa, Kiowa, and Apache, and a great guy.  Okay, this is the Bennie Buffalo that was our    A-ha    moment when we  realized that, yes, you can put things on layaway. We saw it at Philbrook  at a show. We found it; we put it on layaway. We couldn   t afford it, but  some things you can   t put a price on.  25  F. Farris  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  Little Thunder  E. Farris  G. Farris  Never stopped us before.  Right, right. We became forever indebted to galleries after this one.  And Ben was Cheyenne. That   s just gorgeous.  Cheyenne, yes. Isn   t it beautiful? It   s exciting to be around every day.  This is on our daughter   s list. (Laughter)  A good one to put. Well, Elizabeth and Gary, thank you so much.  Oh, our pleasure.  It   s been our pleasure.  -------  -------
