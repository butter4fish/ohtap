 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday August 8, 2009 and we   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma at the Stillwater Public Library interviewing Allene Gill. This  interview is being conducted as part of our Spotlighting Oklahoma: Life  in the 1930   s Oral History Project. Allene, let   s begin with where you  grew up and tell me a little bit about your family.  Well I grew up about 20 miles east of Noble Oklahoma on a farm, 160  acre farm. We had eleven children. Right through the Depression, right  through the sand storm, through it all. It was a pretty rough time because  the country was in bad shape. They say we   re in a recession now, no  way. No way  No way. No way.  What was life like on the farm?  It was work from daylight to dark. There was no money so you had to  raise it and you had to can it or you had to dry it or you had to put it  away because you had to eat in the fall. There were no jobs with money  to buy food so it was up to you. You killed your hogs, you killed your  beef, you killed your chickens, you killed everything. And oh, wouldn   t  it have been wonderful if we   d had electricity to put it away and not had  to can it all. But we didn   t have it. Didn   t have electricity then.  So as a little girl, did you have a chore on the farm?  Did I have a chore? Yeah, we all had a chore. From daylight to dark.  Yes, and when I was approximately seven years old, I had to go to the  milk barn and milk. We all had a cow to milk. My granddaughter asked  me,    How did you milk cows, Mamaw, if you didn   t have any  electricity?    And I said,    With your hands.    They didn   t know that you  milked cows with your hands. But that   s what we did. And if it   s cold,  sometimes your hands would have milk on them and they   d just be  5  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  chapped, you know. You couldn   t wait to get in and wash them in good  warm water and kind of relieve them a little. But yes, and we gathered  eggs. My sister and I had to gather the eggs. Sometimes the hens would  break the eggs, you know, and we   d have to wash and clean those and  get them ready to sell or use to eat, whatever we did with them. But yes,  we had jobs, all the time. And we worked the fields. Many times we  worked the fields. We hoed, we gathered apples, we canned, we helped  in everything. Everybody worked.  Sun up to sun down?  Sun up to sun down. That   s exactly what it was. And tried to get into bed  before you had to light a lamp. They called the lamp coal oil and it was  very expensive. It was seven cents a gallon. Our dad would take us to  bed early to save but in getting up so early in the morning we   d lose it  back. We didn   t make anything on that. It was a funny life.  Well tell me about school. What was school like?  Wonderful. I want you to tell everybody that I have strictly said I have  been there. If you do away with schools, you   re in trouble. That is the  greatest place on earth to learn how to get along with people, how to be  one of the crowd because when you go out in life later you   re going to  either be with them and you   re not going to   if you   re in one of these  other schools you   re not going to know how to meet people, all kinds of  people, and be one of them and play with them and feel what they feel  and know how they feel. It   s just going to be hard on you. The most  wonderful thing is I remember my school days.  Well tell me about elementary school. What was the name of your  elementary school?  E-T-O-W-A-H. Etowah.  And how would you get there?  You   d go to Norman, Oklahoma. And then you   d go about 17 miles east  on number nine and about five miles south and two more back east. And  you   re just about half a mile from the Pottawatomie County line. A big  two room white school, it had a church by it and all. And they used to     down on the corner, Etowah corner they called it, they used to have a     what is the town? The little town. They had everything there, once upon  a time, that you needed. It was a wonderful time. I went back Sunday.  They had what they called a Rural School Round Up. We all met and I  went down to the old home place and it was wonderful to see. The  school has burned. They burned our school but the church is still there. I  6  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  just wouldn   t take anything for one of those good old schools where  everybody was together.  How far was it from the farm?  From the farm? Let   s see. It wasn   t much. Half a mile, probably.  And you   d walk?  Yeah, we walked. And then later, when I graduated, we went to a school  about 14 miles one way. The first one, and we rode a bus because it was  consolidated. All the grade schools went into high school. And then the  next time I went to Noble, and it was further away. It was 48 miles there  and 48 miles home. I was the first on in the morning and the last one on  at night. It was a long ride.  What was that school bus like?  School bus was at Noble, see where we moved. When the war and the  boys all went off to war or either four or five of them, some of them  worked in the plants. Well dad could not run the farm by himself  anymore, you didn   t have tractors. He put up hay and we had those  cattle. He couldn   t do it. So they sold the farm and they went to another  farm, it was smaller. They stayed there about four years and then they  went to California because the boys had Dad a job out there. And when I  did, it was a long ways to school. I had to ride that bus so far to get to  that school because it was a long ways from where our farm was, the  second farm. But I wouldn   t trade nothing.  It was a hard life, a very hard life of work and so on. But people were  laughing and enjoying one another and it was so wonderful a time.  Assets, money, we didn   t have. But the assets we had were love for one  another, helping one another, caring for one another, and that   s gone.  America has lost America. They have flat lost it. And it   s sad. Very sad.  And instead of taking advantage of somebody, they   d try to help  everybody. If a man was ill and he couldn   t get his crop in, all the men  in the community went in and helped. If the woman was ill and she  couldn   t take care of her family, the women would cook food and took  in and cleaned her house and helped her. But you don   t find that  anymore. You don   t find America, either. That   s America. We had some  good times. We didn   t have a Wal-Mart. We couldn   t go and buy any  toys. We used our mind. We made up our toys.  What were some of the things you made up?  Well, first of all, we always had a barrel and we   d barrel walk. You  7  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  know, roll on off and that was very good for you. It kept you up, you  know, kept you real light on your feet, so to speak, or you   d fall off.  Then we made tray things. My brother took four wheels and made us a  buggy thing. We   d push it to the top of the hill and then we   d get on it  and down we   d go. And then we   d go push it back up. Then we made  things just by hand. I mean, just what we had to do with. We   d play     it   s so funny. We   d dig holes and then we had a good size ball and then  we   d play golf and try to get it in that hole and we just made up our  games, you know. And lots of times my brother would put up two posts.  And then he put a big long nail up between up so far and we   d put a  stick across there. We   d all jump the first and ones who didn   t would get  a side. And then we   d jump through second. Ones who couldn   t would  stand aside and wait. And that way we   d find out who could jump the  tallest. We just had fun, that   s all. Then we   d play Auntie Over. Did you  ever play Auntie Over?  Tell me about it.  Okay, you get a big ball, it   s usually a big rubber ball. And you choose  up sides. You get over the house, one gets on one side of the house and  one the other. You throw the ball and you say,    Auntie over     and they   d  say,    Send it over     And you real quick put it over. If you run around the  side and catch them before they can get rid of it, then they would go into  what they called the pot. Just fun. I mean fun, you just pick it up, that   s  all. But it   s something they don   t play. You know, kids don   t use their  imagination to make up things anymore because it   s all there and they  just use it. But this is a wonderful time and there were so many of us. As  I said, there were 11 of us that we could just play any kind of game we  wanted and everybody came to our house because there was a whole  group there that could play ball or whatever we wanted to play. And we  had fun. Poor Mother, she always had more than 11. She always had all  of the neighbors, too  But it was nice and it was fun.  It leaves beautiful memories. And I wouldn   t trade it. It was hard. But it  taught us something that the children are not getting now. And that is  independence, caring for somebody else besides yourself, going out of  your way to help somebody that   s in trouble. It   s a different world, very  different. I remember school so well because our teacher taught our  grade school so well. When she was teaching you to spell. What she  would do, she would make you sound the word, sound it out completely.  If it had an    ing you didn   t put an    n, you know, sound it out. Then you  spelled that word. Now she said, use it in a sentence. And then that  word   s yours from now on. They taught different, much different. I had  children and grandchildren come up and I could see the difference.  One time, one of our grandsons stayed with us in Norman and attended  8  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  OU. He had friends who would come there to the house and they would  do their lesson. I was astounded to see how little they knew about things.  I could not believe they couldn   t work a problem. And their English was  terrible. They couldn   t write anything and I thought,    Where did they  spend their life in school?    Because we were grounded in it. I mean  geography, history, all that had to be taken, that four. You know those  four? And we   d have them all through high school. We were grounded  in it and I thought,    Well, they don   t know anything about our history,  they didn   t know our geography.    I don   t know what they were taught,  honestly.  Well let   s talk a little bit about your mother.  My mother?  I mean, the food she would cook.  Oh my gosh, marvelous food because you cooked it in a wood stove.  Mother was a wonderful cook. She was from Alabama, down south, a  southern cook. Mother was a wonderful cook. And she knew how to  cook, she knew how to take a little of nothing and fix it and make it be  good. All of them did.  What would she cook?  Pies, cakes, baked meat, mashed potatoes, green beans. You had this  garden and you had all this good stuff to get in and cook and it was  good, very good. And people would come to our house because they  loved her cooking. She was good. But a lot of your older women then  were good cooks. You see, they cooked from scratch with what was  there. They didn   t have all this extra stuff, you know. They made it all  up and they knew how to season and how to cook it. And let   s face it,  there   s nothing that cooks a pie or a cake or a biscuit like an old wood  stove.  That   s true.  It   s true. That heat is a warm even heat. I have an electric stove and I  don   t think it cooks worth a hoot.  I agree with you.  Yep.  What about canning? Would she do a lot of canning?  9  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Oh my goodness, yes honey. We had to can because we didn   t have  refrigeration to put in the freezer. Everything canned. Besides, we dried  peaches and we dried apples. We had big apple orchards. We had two of  them on our farm. And you peeled apples and cut them in slices, like  kind of pie slices. And you took a sheet, a white sheet, you put in on top  of a tin bar and you spread them out there and let them dry. You had to  take them in at night because you didn   t let   the night air, the dew  would make them turn black. You take them in, take them back, and put  them back that day. And you thought,    Oh, I hope they hurry up and get  dry. It   s hot up here on top of these stairs.    Yeah, yes, we canned  everything. Pickles, peaches, beets, everything.  Where would you put all the cans?  We had a half basement under our house and then we had a cellar. A dirt  cellar, the kind that   s really cool. We had shelves in there and we had  everything in there. She made sauerkraut and we had big old jars down  in our basement. Pickles, a lot of the pickles she pickled in jars, but a lot  of them she put in kegs. Five gallon keg pickles. Then we raised  sorghum molasses. Made sorghum. We took it down and had the man  grind them into sorghum molasses. We made that. We had corn and we  shelled it and ground some corn meal. Only thing we bought was flour,  baking powder, salt, all the seasonings like spices and black pepper. And  the rest you raised.  Was it tough to find the money to buy the staples you needed?  A few, yeah. I don   t know if they   ve ever told you about this, but there  was a Watkins man that came around and he sold all this stuff. You  could get vanilla that high for 10 cents, you know. It had to be, because  we didn   t have any money. Yeah, and we had cotton. It was a cotton  crop. And Dad, he would go off and he worked on building bridges. He  did all that riveting and everything. And he also could fix guns. He could  clean guns and fix guns. He was great. See, he was from Alabama in the  mountains where those old mountain men knew guns. He knew them.  And we had chickens, eggs and chickens to eat. And we had cows with  butter and milk and we churned our buttermilk. That was fun. I loved to  churn   That was a fun chore?  Yeah. My sister and I would take turns. We   d count 20 dashes and then  the other would dash. It was just fun.  Did you ever barter crops?  10  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Barter? That   s the way we lived. One time, I remember   well we had  two big old orchards of apples. And we had people come down in their  wagons and just pick up apples and take them off. You know, they need  something and they took them. And then one winter, Dad planted turnips  down in the bottom. You know we had a lot of bottom land. We made  hay for those cattle and everything. And those things grew so big. We  had people to come down and one man said,    Well, I had made a big  crop of potatoes, sweet potatoes.    So he swapped us sweet potatoes and  we swapped him turnips. This is the way we did. And you saw that  nobody went hungry. You went around and checked that nobody went  hungry, you took care of them.  I   ll never forget Franklin Delano Roosevelt. God bless that man,  wherever he lies today. He brought out to every grade school, he brought  the boys tops and yoyos and the girls jacks and balls to play with. He  brought them to all the grade schools, he sent them. And he sent  crackers, so at noon the women would send up soup mixtures and we  older girls would go in the back room where they had that big old stove  in the second room and we would heat it up. That way we   d have those  crackers. And don   t let them tell you,    Don   t drink after somebody, it   ll  kill you,    because in the winter time when we couldn   t have the pump  outside, it was in a pump with a little house over it and it would freeze  up, we   d have our water in a great big old bucket thing. Everybody  would drink out of it, and nobody died. Nobody died.  Well that   s good.  That   s right. But you know now, oh my, that wouldn   t be allowed. But it  didn   t bother anybody.  So your family is a big fan of Franklin Roosevelt?  Oh, yes. I voted for President Roosevelt. Yeah, I voted for him up until  he died. Yes, we sure did. But I   m so thankful for him of the things he  did to give jobs to the men and that he saw the kids had something to  play with in school and that he cared enough to get the crackers there.  The parents couldn   t afford the crackers, but they could raise the soup  mixture. And yes, I have been to the soup lines. I know the soup lines  quite well. They used to have them on Friday nights at the different  schools. And I have seen a grown man cry because they   d stand back  and let the women and children have it. It hurt them that they had to use  that soup line. It wasn   t because they wanted to, there just were no jobs.  And the people were very, very, very good about everything. They  didn   t cry and they didn   t whine, but it hurt. You could tell it hurt. And  we didn   t come out of it until World War II. That   s the only thing. Cause  see, when you had all them factories and all that ammunition to build  11  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  and to get ready and ships to build and to fight the war, it brought jobs.  That was the difference.  But there   s one group that I feel terribly bad about. Those are the kids,  my age, who went through grade school and they got out that horrible  and went through the dust storm and through the   and it was a  Depression, like you   d never know, if you wasn   t there. Then they went  right into that war and were killed. They never had a chance to come out  and have anything. I   ve always hated that and always felt so bad about  it. Those little ones, they didn   t ever have a chance for anything. A lot of  them came back crippled, too; a lot of them from our community, from  little schools all around.  Going back to going to school, what would you wear to school? Would  your mom make clothes?  Oh everything, she made everything. And you won   t believe this, but  she didn   t have patterns. She just put a newspaper up to you and cut a  pattern wrap. I was talking to a girl, she remembered her mother doing  the same thing. We have what we called every year, once a year (which  was last Sunday down at Etowah church) the Rural School Round Up.  All the schools are closed now, all the country schools were closed.  They get together and we old timers are still hanging in there a little bit  and tell them about the times in school and when we met on Friday  evenings and had ballgames, basketball games and all that. You know  we had what they called geography. And in geography, the teacher  would call out a city or a town and see who could get the state quickest,  where it was. And then they made us memorize all, starting with the top  to the last president. We had to know the presidents, we had to know  that. And I think about every week we had to memorize a poem. They  don   t memorize poems anymore. We had to memorize all those poems.  Do you remember a poem?  Yes, some of them.  Why don   t you tell me one?  Well okay, I remember   being as it   s getting this late, there   s one called     September.    And let   s see, how did it go here? Let   s see. Something  about the, let me see:  The golden rod is yellow  The leaves are turning brown  The trees in the apple orchard  With fruit are bending down.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  The gentian   s bluest fringes  Are curling in the sun  And dusty pods of milkweed  Are hidden silk as spun  I remember that one  (Laughter)  That   s great.  But you just had to memorize those things. And we got Christmas  programs, you know. The kids in school would say what we memorized  and things. And we had plays we put on. Christmas has never been the  same since then.  What were holidays like? What was Christmas like?  At Christmas we   d meet. Everybody would come to Etowah. We had the  big church and we had the two big white buildings. And all the other  schools around, you know there was one every three miles. That   s what  they made the grade school because all the kids could walk, the little  ones. They   d come there and we   d go out. They   d cut an old cedar and I  can still smell that thing. You know the wood stove would be going and  that old cedar you could smell it and you could pop popcorn to hang on  it and red berries. And there was just smell. And that big old tree,  everybody would bring their gifts in and oh, I   d say just about when  everything was over, we   d sing the Christmas songs and we   d put on the  program for everybody.  And here someone would come inside the house and the men said,    We  see a dark object up in the sky. We think it   s Santa.    The little kids  would get all excited. In a little while, another one comes and says,     Yes, it is him.    And pretty soon you   d hear the bells ring out in the  yard. And Santa would come in with his pack and I remember Oliver  Roselius, he always had hard candy and he   d hit it on the back and it   d  shatter everywhere. He   d ho, ho, ho coming in. He dropped that sack up  there with all those toys. And those kids are so excited, couldn   t sit still.  But then someone would stand up there and call off the names. They   d  have the tag and the kids would come up and get the toys. But the way  they got the money, yeah and when everybody left there with a brown  sack. It had an orange and an apple and candy and nuts in it. Everybody  got one of those.  The way we got the money for them, we had pie supper sales, box sales  and some of those people, I can still remember, made the most beautiful  boxes. They were artistic, all the people in the country. We were  countrified but those girls would bring those boxes and were beautiful  13  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  made. And then the pies and everything inside of them. The boyfriends  of the girls would try to get their pies. And some of those ornery old  men in the back would run it up on them in order to get more money  It  was fun. It was simple, but very fun. Much fun. Everybody enjoyed it. I  even think back to it now and I think it   s a wonderful time. Although it  was hard, very hard, because you knew you weren   t going to be able to  go on to college. You could not go anywhere. The bank was broke and  closed. No money, no jobs. And you didn   t know how you ever were  going to get out of the hole. Going to ever be able to save anything or  get yourself out. And we couldn   t have except World War II. But then  when I think about the good things, they were wonderful. And I think  the kids are missing out on a lot.  Well you were telling me about your mother and how she would put the  newspaper up to do.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Would she buy the fabric or would you use flour sacks?  Yeah, well we have used some flour sacks, but we   d usually buy the  fabric. You know you could get fabric for ten cents a yard.  And where would you go to buy fabric?  Norman. This big town, Norman, Oklahoma.  What stores would she go to?  Now let me see if I can remember. It   s been so long that I don   t know if  I can remember that. But they were just plain what we called dry good  stores. And they had shoes, they had clothing, men, women, children  shoes and all in the early years they were on Main Street there in  Norman. She   d buy those and she made it all. She had this old treadle  machine. The Amish still use them, this old treadle machine. I   ve gone  to sleep many a night hearing that thing go    brr,    you know. You could  make that thing hum. And, what was so funny, I had a baby sister. There  were five of the girls and six boys. I had a baby sister and we handed a  dress down to her. It was in pretty bad shape. And she   d say,    Oh it   s  ugly, I don   t want it.    And she   d cry. So Mom would take it and she   d  let the hem out. It   d be a white place, but she   d take ric-rac and she   d  make like three layers around it. And then she put it around the sleeve or  collar so it   d look like it matched. That was a beautiful dress, she liked  that. Same old dress. (Laughter) It   s make-do. You made do. And forgot  about what you didn   t have. You took what you could do.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  What about shoes?  Shoes? Yes. You probably were lucky if you got two pair. A dark pair  for winter and another pair for spring. I remember my shoes going into  high school and all was saddle oxfords, brown and white saddle oxfords.  And Dad did our shoes. He had a thing that was tall and it looked like a  shoe, iron. And then the place you sat on behind it, a little seat, he would  put our shoes across that and he had shoe soles that he had bought and  he had a knife that would cut anything. He   d trim that off and then he  would tack it on and we had a new pair of shoes. That   s what he   d do.  And we just hoped and prayed he got all the tacks and didn   t miss one,  you know. And then, sometimes we would take the white shoes and they  had what they called jet oil, it   s in a bottle, and you   d black them. If they  were white and you were going into winter, you know, and they were  still good shoes, you could black those and get by. And I remember one  time, we bought new shoe strings and they were those tweed looking  pretty little   you   ve seen them. My sister and I, we got a long pair. So  dad could cut them in two and put them in our little oxfords and he   d put  tippets on the end of them. So we got a ten cent pair and then we got two  out of it. Things like this you learn to do and do without. If you couldn   t,  you did without.  Lots of frugal living.  Frugal. Very frugal. But you had to live and you had to do and you did  what you could. And didn   t worry about the rest of it. You couldn   t.  Tell me about Ms. Mamie.  Oh, the most wonderful teacher in the world. When anyone says teacher,  I think of her. Her name was Mamie Birdstresser. The little kids couldn   t  say Birdstresser, it came out    stretcher    so she had them just call her Ms.  Mamie. Everybody went to school to her and loved it. She was so good.  And she taught so well. She was so sweet, if someone boo booed, she  didn   t make fun of it. She   d laugh with them, have everybody laughing  and they wouldn   t feel bad. And she didn   t point anything out. I  remember one time we were practicing for Christmas and were singing     O Little Town of Bethlehem.    And the kids were saying    O Little  Town of Bethle-ham.    She got up and died laughing. She turned up the  tail of her dress. She said,    No. Hem, hem, hem. Like it   s the hem. Not a  ham, a hem. A dress hem.    It was just things like that, you know. And  she wouldn   t make fun of anybody. She   d just go along and laugh. You  wouldn   t feel bad when you boo booed because she didn   t show it up.  And she   d help you any way she could to learn. She knew how to  explain something so well that you remembered it. She could get it  15  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  across in your language, so to speak. And she was just wonderful. I just  think she   s marvelous. She just put down a good foundation for high  school. She put down a damn good foundation. She   s so sweet. She quit  the last two years, my last two years in grade school. Her brother taught  because she started her family and her brother took over and he taught  two years. They lived there in the neighborhood. There was a corner  called Etowah corner and it had stores, it had anything you needed. You  could go to it and get it. It was kind of a little country town then. They  lived there. Her dad was a blacksmith. He was the blacksmith there at  the corner.  Good memories.  Yeah. And you had to go all the way down there to the mailbox. It   s  quite a ways, about a mile and a half, to get your mail because it all  came right there. Before, it was on Noble route when it came. But before  that, when the town was first there, I saw some of the letters that came in  and it was called Etowah, Indian Territory. And then later when the  town kind of went down, they moved the post office to Noble,  Oklahoma. That   s a town just south of Norman. They run together. You  can   t tell where one begins and the other ends.  Well going to high school, I understand you played a little bit of  basketball.  Yes, I loved that basketball.  Tell me about playing basketball.  Okay, it   s crazy. First of all, we played on a dirt court in grade school  with the boys, full court. It   s so funny. When we got into high school,  they decided it was hard on the girls. Now we   ve come through this  working like boys, right beside, but they thought that was too much on  us. So they cut it into three: two centers, two guards and two forwards.  You only could dribble one time and you had to throw it. You didn   t  have much maneuverability room there either. I hated that way. We all  fussed about it. So they said, well we   ll put it in halves. So they put it in  halves, three guards and three forwards. And I think that   s what they do  now. No, they go all over, don   t they. And when you got the ball, it was  this way. Every time there was a score made, they took turns about that  he   d throw it to this girl and throw over there and the next time we  scored we   d do the same. And it was wonderful, but it was different.  You didn   t throw your hands over your head to make the free throws.  You took the ball, you laid it between your knees down on the line and  then you came up with it. That   s the way you did your free throws.  Come up like this and made your free throws. And oh, it was kind of  16  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  wild. They went back to full court and I like that better.  What kind of uniforms would you wear?  Shorts. A short, like they used to wear, shorts. And a little knit top. Then  we had warm-up suits that we used to warm up in. Believe you me, you  needed them, because there was no shower in either one of those places.  There were no showers and there were no indoor toilets. And they  heated it with a stove and you needed your warm ups. But I like Noble  better. Their suits were better and they were a better quality. And I loved  the colors better. The one at Macomb was red and black and knit. And  the one at Noble, those at Noble were a beautiful blue satin and gold.  Gold and blue. And they had buttons that were rubber buttons and they  had the gussets so they didn   t tear, you know. And they had beautiful  warm-up suits. I liked those better than I did the others. I played all four  years. I love basketball.  Would you ever play against Bing High School?  No. They went to Ada one year and went to the playoff, but we got out  before we had to play them. But one time, I remember one time that old  woman teacher they had, what was her name?  Bertha Teague?  Yeah, Teague. Oh, mercy me. Mercy me. She had them girls, if you tried  to jump center, they   d put their foot on your toe and nearly break it.  They would cheat?  Yeah, they would cheat, are you kidding? I was captain, so I went to the  referee, you know the captain   s allowed. I said,    You watch them when  we jump, they   re putting their feet on our foot.    He said,    I   ll watch  them.    He caught them. Then they chewed tobacco. Yeah  And they   d  spit it in your eye. Oh, they were nasty.  (Laughter)  I   m not kidding you. And she was mean. The referee would get on to her  and he   s had to send her off so many times. She   d go out there while  we   re just playing ball and she   d take chalk and draw a line for one of  her girls to stand on to make a throw, a place where she was a good  standing to make a field goal. He had to get rid of her out there and wipe  them off. She was ornery. She   d get mad and she   d stomp her feet.  The things we do to win a game.  17  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  And she was good  But she had good girls. I imagine all of her girls  were six or six-two or better. And the rest of us were shorter people. She  brought them in there from everywhere. And the boys were good, too.  They were tall. But that was the first time I   ve ever seen bringing people  in just to build up. Usually you played what was in your neighborhood  or what was in your school. But yes, Bertha Teague was something else.  Well I guess going to high school was a lot different than going to the  rural school?  I   ll tell you what, yes it was different. Because see, you always had one  room and they called up the class, you know, to the front row to recite.  But when you went there, everybody had their room and they rang the  bell and then, like it is now, you go into your rooms. And it was  different. It was harder. You learned along with it and you went along  with it. I always loved school. I loved to read books. I had every book  read at Etowah library and then I read them all in Macomb, I read them  all in Noble. I loved books. I read all the time. I still read  I still read all  the time.  Would you go to libraries?  Yeah. When I was in Norman, I used to have a   I helped Jerry get his  card so he would have books. And then I did, too. But I   ve always loved  books. I   d read everything I could get my hands on. I was just hungry  for knowledge. I wanted to learn. Oh how nice if we could have gone to  college. If we could have just gone to college, it would have been so  nice. But it was not to be.  Well what were your options after high school? I mean what     Just go back home and start hoeing and picking cotton again. I mean, it  was over.  Right.  It was over. And most of the people married, and they married young  because we matured. You just couldn   t hardly go back to being one of  the little kids. Usually they went out and started their own families and  their own life. That   s about what was left for you. It was a hard thing to  think about. I mean, you know, you couldn   t go any further.  It seems you had a lot of good times growing up and, of course, you had  a lot of rough times.  Yeah, right, rough ones. But don   t forget we did have some good ones.  18  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Absolutely.  Absolutely, good ones. And you know, everybody instead of whining,  we used what we had the best we could and didn   t worry about what we  didn   t have. We just went with the flow, you had to.  And everybody was in the same boat?  Same boat, everybody. And they understood one another. And there  wasn   t the real rich and the real poor, just all poor  All poor.  Would you ever have hobos go through?  Oh yeah, we had hobos. Especially in Noble, they used to come down  the tracks. That   s where they   d get off those trains. Oh yeah, there was a  lot of hobos during those days. And a lot of them were going out to  California, a place where they had work. Cause they didn   t have any  work here. Out there they had so much fruit. And that   s the reason that  he wrote The Grapes of Wrath. That   s where those people were going,  where there was work. What happened to them, those people couldn   t  even pay the taxes on their houses and the big shops. If you   ve seen,  they came in and possessed their homes   they weren   t much, but they  were homes   and knocked them down and took over their land and  there was nowhere they had to go so they had to get up and go to  California to get a job.  Would you ever have the hobos come and knock on your door?  No, I don   t remember that. But I do remember people that would come  to the door and ask if we had any   they were in the neighborhood, if we  had any this or that or something, like do you have too many apples or  do you have more than you need? And of course Dad always said yes.  We had this beautiful land. We had 160 acres, most of it was nice  bottom land we had our cattle on. What I couldn   t understand, the  bankers, they would repossess somebody   s place, take their cattle and  everything. And then they   d bring them out to us and have to pay us to  deal with them. Why didn   t they just leave them with those people? It  cost them more for us to feed them and take care of them for them. And  they needed that. They needed it for milk and butter. I just couldn   t see  that. It didn   t make any sense to me. In fact, it wouldn   t have cost them  near as much. Just let them keep them, you know. Cause you had to pay  so much a month for us for hay and stuff. With a big bunch of kids like  there was, there was everybody pulling tricks for fun.  Oh really, what kind?  19  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  I   ll tell you one time, it   s funny  My brother and I, there were just about  18 months between us. We used to do a lot of the work together. So we  cut the hay down in the meadow. And we were on a buck rake, it would  rake the hay up. Well in the meantime, there was those old, what do you  call them? Old bumblebees down in the ground. And we happened to get  some up. And there, we put the buck rake up, it turns loose hay down  there and that thing was impaled. They were just flying around and oh  off we stole. Angry things, dangerous. And Dad called out and said,     Unhitch those horses  They   re going to run away with that buck rake  and hurt themselves.    We laugh about it. He had so many kids that he  didn   t bother about the kids. He didn   t tell us to run. Dad had nine more  at home, you know. But a good span of horses, you better watch out. We  die a laughing, he and I, every time we get together. That   s the way it  was.  Cared about those animals.  Yeah.  You needed them.  And one time, we were canning, my mom   s getting ready to can. She  went down in the cellar. She always picked out anything that didn   t look  good, we   d open it up. She had some grape juice and it got a mother on  it, you know how that white   and she didn   t like the looks. She told my  brother, Coy, now she says,    You take these down in the bottom down  close to the garden. Take you a spade, dig you a hole, open them up, put  it in there and cover it up. Bring the jars back and I   ll wash them.    Well  that was a long ways down there and up a hill. We went by the hog pen  and knew the hogs would eat anything. (Laughter) We gave them that  juice and they got drunk on it   (Laughter)  I swear they were screaming and they were falling on the ground and  hitting into the fence and running into the troughs. But now see, they  didn   t whip us, they got tickled. I was afraid they were going to be mad,  but they got tickled and thought it was funny.  Well I guess with 11 kids, you   d cause a fair amount of     We did everything. Honest to God, you just talk about it. We climbed  trees, we picked pecans, we had pecans. We had plum thickets, we   d  gather plums. And blackberries, we had blackberries growing up and  down that bottom. We just had fun together. We raised sugar cane to  make our sorghum. And we always had big, big gardens. Apples, and we  20  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  did fine in the winter when there wasn   t any of that and so we had to  have it all put up for the winter until spring could arrive and we could  get a garden going again, but we were always doing something. We used  to climb up in trees, willows. A willow will give and not break, a green  willow. It   s on the banks of the river that ran through, and it was sandy  down there. We   d climb up there and we   d get up there and it was just  so fun. We   d all jump off and bend down then we   d jump off. The one  that was left up there was just shaking to pieces. Oh, we did a bunch of  things. But did you know, we knew how to protect ourselves. All that  time, not a one had a broken arm, a broken shoulder, or anything broken.  We knew how to land. We used to jump off a big tall building. You  knew how to land, you knew how to climb a tree, you didn   t fall out.  And not a one of us ever had a broken bone.  Did you ever have any dust blowing around out there?  Oh, are you kidding? Yes, we came through the dust storm, too  That  was when it was so dry and didn   t have any rain for a year. And I have  seen cracks in the ground, hot weather cracks, that a little dog or a little  cat could have fallen in and you could have lost them. That was how bad  it was. I thought it would never rain. And that was what was the worst  because it was the time of year we needed to raise the crops more than  anything but we got one of those. And that dust, you   d see a little dark  cloud coming in, you knew to run and grab any laundry that was on the  line. You grabbed it and would run in the house and get the children in  and shut down. That   s what got hot because you didn   t have air  conditioning, but to shut those windows down.  I remember my mother trying to fix a meal on the table and we would  just have to wipe it continually so we could get down and get our food  on the table. Just dust all over, it   s pitiful. And I have seen fence posts  covered with dust like snow clear up to the top. Oh, it was bad. The dust  storm was just about as bad as the other. And they both came   like I  said, we needed the weather to raise our food. And it wasn   t there.  That was a tough time.  Tough, very tough. Very tough. We laugh and we say they buried the  ones that wouldn   t tell. They   re out in the cemetery, the rest of us all  lived. Good, bad, or indifferent we lived.  I understand your mother was a midwife.  Yeah, she was.  What was she like?  21  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  They were after her all time. The women had babies, they didn   t have  any birth control. But my sister and I, at the time, we were about ten and  twelve years old. And we would get so aggravated. Dad had a Model A  and when he   d come out with that Model A, we had a double car garage  and he   d come around like that, the lights would flash on our window.  We would say,    Oh, someone else is having a baby, we   ll have to get up  and cook breakfast.    And we would. We   d have to get up and cook  breakfast. Mom would be taking care of them. But she not only  delivered babies, she helped the doctors do surgeries out in the country.  And do you know how they did it? They took a door off and put it on a  saw horse, a door. A wooden door, put it on a saw horse. And they take  soap, that old soap, clean it off, completely scrub it clean. Then they   d  run over it with some more stuff that cleaned it off and then put a sheet  on it. Mother would hand him the tools and he   d operate. He   d take out  an appendix. And Dad was sitting there holding the lamp. And what was  so funny, my dad would nearly pass out, he   d nearly throw up. He never  could stand it, you know. But that   s the way we lived. It was tough, girl.  Would you watch the operations?  I saw two, but they were in Norman when Leon had his appendix out.  We had been married about a year I guess, so I went in and watched  them operate on him. Then he had his tonsils out in the doctor   s office  and I was there. And then my sister had female surgery and I watched  that. But that was in Norman and it was in a hospital. I never did out in  the country.  How did she learn?  I don   t know. But Dr. Cordell said,    She   s one of the greatest nurses I  ever saw to have not attended a nursing school.    It   s natural. She  brought it down out of those mountains. Her mother did it, and her  grandmother. See, she   s from Paint Rock Valley, Tennessee, right along  the line of Alabama there. And those old women up in those mountains,  they did it all. And she knew how. She told us girls one time, she told us  how to take care of a woman if she was caught without a doctor and the  baby. She said,    Don   t you girls dare sit there and let a woman die and  her baby die because you won   t do something.    So she told us how to  take care of this woman. Mama was tough. She had 13 children. Two are  buried in the mountains in Paint Rock Valley. And the other 11 of us all  lived to be retired. So I guess we got our toughness from her.  I would guess so.  I guess, I guess. She lived to be 93. Dad would have lived longer, he  lived to be 78, but he got cancer and he wouldn   t have anything done, so  22  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  there was no hope for him. That is a day that   s gone forever.  I was going to tell you I forgot about why they didn   t let them keep the  cattle instead of bringing them to us and paying us to take care of them.  All you had to do was to show so many head of cattle and they   d come  by and check them out once a month. Well they were checking on us to  see if we were eating them or stealing them. And Dad would take an old  sorry one to put in. He   d take that good one that could have a calf and  take it and give it to them. We   d take it down and give it to them so  they   d have something to eat. And we   d put that old thing on the wagon  and try to lead her. And oh, she was stubborn, she wouldn   t leave. I was  standing behind coaxing her and the other was pulling her on the wagon.  We   d be tickled to death when we got her over to their house and turned  her loose. My brother would say,    Man, I   m glad that   s over.     So, I want to know, I   m going to put you on the spot and then we   re  going to compare notes between you and your husband.  Okay.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, we were at a party. They called them play parties, to where you  would call and play with them. There was one, and that   s the first time I  saw him. It was over in my neighborhood. We went to it, and he came  down from his neighborhood. He lived quite a little ways from me. Not a  long ways, but not in our area. So he and some more boys came to that  party. And the next time I saw him, my brothers and I came from Noble  High School and come home that weekend. I   d been attending up there  and I came home. And he said,    Have you ever been to an Indian Stomp  Dance?    I said no. And my brother said,    Well come, go with me. They  have them over here at Little Ax.    What they do is they build a fire and  they stomp around and call all around. Well I said,    I   m a real good  friend of one of the big shots    daughters over there.    And so he said,     Well come on.    Well I saw him there, and while I was there, this girl  warned me, you couldn   t dance when it was a real nice dance just for  Indians. But when they had like praying for rain or water, they   d allow  others to come in and dance. She put them old things on my legs. They  just scratched awful. And you had to stomp around, and you had to  answer and you had to dance. So I danced. I told my brother,    I don   t  know if I want to go to anymore of those or not.    And then I met him  there. I saw him there, and his boys, again. After that, he started coming  down. I had a brother   one of my older brothers then was dating a girl  and we four would go dating. And my brother and his wife, this girl,  they married about six weeks after we did. But they stood up with us  when we were married in Noble. We were in the Baptist minister   s  23  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  parsonage there at Noble, is where we were married in 1939.  That was a long time ago.  A long time. Seventy years. We   re going to  have an anniversary party .  We have a daughter coming in. She lives 100 miles north of Seattle, on  an island. She   s coming in for it. And then we have one that lives in  Ardmore and then we have Jerry. And the kids and the grandkids are  going to all get together and give us a big hoopla. I told them let   s make  this the last one.  No, you need 70 more   No. They ask how do you live and stay married that long? Well, a day at  a time. That   s the way we lived through the Depression. That   s the way  we lived through the sand storm. A day at a time. You don   t fly, but you  just go along. That   s it. First thing, you wake up and you can   t believe it,  it   s been that long.  Well after you got married, where did you live?  Where did we live? Well first of all, we farmed. His grandfather was  unable to farm, so they had a farmhouse and we farmed for him for two  years. And then my husband, I said,    Now look, this farming business  will never do because it   s going to go into big farms with big equipment,  big tractors. We   re going to have to get out of this mess. And I want you  to get a trade.    So he went to a trade school. And that   s the forerunner of  these schools you have right over here. But they were called NYA,  National Youth Association, run by the government.  So he trained to be an electrician and just at the right time. When the war  came on, they didn   t have many people with any training. They were all  farmers and kids. But he had just finished his. So they put him in  Oklahoma City. When they brought all of those planes that they were  building up there to get over to our boys, he would go over them, and  two more guys. I think one was an Air Force guy and one was maybe a  Naval guy, they would all go over anything they didn   t have right and  check it out. And that   s where we lived. We lived in Norman. And we  lived in the City.  Then we went to Seattle, Washington. They wanted him to work up  there to put on minesweepers. They brought in all foreign countries on  our side, came into Seattle, Washington in their big ships and they  wanted minesweepers to put on the front of them to sweep the mines off  before they got to them. And then when that was over, they said,    We   re  going to take you off, call you up.    So we came on back to Norman and  24  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  he said,    Well, they say they   re going to be a while calling me up.    So I  said,    Just go ahead and keep working in the City until they do.    So he  kept working and they didn   t call him, didn   t call him. Then they found  out that they needed him to work on those planes. So then they took him  and they sent him to Jacksonville, Florida. He worked down there for the  Naval. And he went to San Diego. He was there when Jerry was born.  He didn   t see Jerry until he was about nine months old.  Wow.  And I was at home with three little children. Another hard roll. I get so  tickled when these girls tell about they are with their parents and they   ve  got good money and everything, their husbands are overseas. I   ll just tell  you a little story, the wife got  50 a month, the first child  30, any  additional  20. So  120 a month. I had to pay rent and feed two children  on bottles and myself and another little girl. So there was another hard  time. So when he got home and he had his training, I told him, I said,    I  want you to go join the Union. They pay decent wages, you   ve got your  training, and we   re going to start out.    From then on, we did. That was a  much better life. They paid better. They paid their workers and people  better than they do now. Trying to knock it out, but I   m just going to put  this down, a lot of people don   t believe me. The best thing in the world  for the working man was the Union because they had money, they  bought homes, they bought cars, they bought refrigerators, they kept the  economy going. Now they don   t have it, see they can   t buy anything. No  jobs, they had jobs. Well it was a hard life. And I know a lot of people  think,    Well, I wouldn   t want to go through it.    Well no, not unless you  had to. But it wasn   t all bad.  Sure. You had some good times.  Had some wonderful times I   ll take to the grave with me. Just wonderful  memories of people and you had old friends that are still friends. You  keep up with them. When you go through something like that together, it  kind of binds you. You know, you   re of a time that nobody else is. And  you try to tell them about it, but it   s hard to tell. You   ve got to feel it. No  money. Your country   s broke. No freebies, no social security, none of  that. Nothing to fall back on. Nothing but just you, yourself working the  soil. That   s all you could do is just live but there was a great generation  come out of it, I   ll tell you.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oklahoma. Home. Roots. Family. When I think about it, I went by the  old farm place, Jerry took us down. I think about all of them , my  siblings . There   s three of them dead, the other eight   s still living. And I  25  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  love that old schoolhouse. It   s burned now, but the memories are there.  And it   s home. It was a tough place, but it wasn   t just Oklahoma. Texas  and a lot of them had it. We were all in the same boat. Oklahoma, I   m  proud of Oklahoma. I like Oklahoma. I don   t care what they say about it,  she   s tough and she   ll hang in there and she did a long time ago. We  fought the wars, we come out of that and we   re still here. I don   t know  for how long, but we   re still here. But I like Oklahoma. I love  Oklahoma. Because she   s independent and she can get along on her  own. She doesn   t have to have a handout if she doesn   t want it. She   ll  make it. And I love OSU because Jerry and Susan attended there and  because their children attended, so that   s why. Even though I was born  and raised in Norman, OSU  Stillwater  is really our town.  Was education very important with your family when you were raising  your children?  Yes, as important as it could be, honey, but there   s just so far you could  go. And then after that, that was it. I   m telling you, I loved every day of  school. Every day of grade school, every day of high school. I loved it.  Well it   s good that you could pass that down to your children.  I hope so. I hope I did. Because I think I did and Jerry   s that way, too,  and the girls. I told them, I said,    Now look. The only way you   re going  to ever get out of a hole or get out and demand any kind of wages,  you   re going have to have that education.    I told them that long ago.  You   re going to have to get it. I said,    Now your dad didn   t get it  because he needed a trade so he could make a living. So he took the  trade.    Oh yeah, I would have gone on to college. I   d love it. I would  have gone on for my master   s and everything. I guess I might be still  going to school. I loved it. I really did. I just loved it. When that old  school bell would ring, we could hear it down to our house. And the  grade school, I couldn   t wait to get to school. I loved it. And so many  kids, you have to drag them off to school and all that, I couldn   t see that,  I couldn   t see it.  Well are there any other memories you   d like to share with us today  about your time growing up?  I just know that it was a rough time and we didn   t have an awful lot, but  we went to school and we went to church and we had good ice cream  festivals and we always had Fourth of July down on the rivers and it was  just a good fun time. People had fun times. That   s all.  Good memories.  26  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Nykolaiszyn  Gill  Yeah, I loved it. I loved it. I know it was rough, but then there were  wonderful times there. It has to be what you want, what you   re looking  for. We weren   t looking for golden streets. We weren   t looking for easy  times like they do now. Just one day at a time is all we asked for and we  took it, we did the best we could with it. And that   s it.  Well thank you so much for joining us today.  Thank you, honey, for taking it down because it   s going to be soon gone.  There   s just a few of us left. Thank you for doing this. And Jerry told us,     Mother, you   ve got to get up there because you two lived it.     Absolutely.  We absolutely lived it. I sure did.  -------  -------
