 Little Thunder  Fields  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, April 13,  and I am interviewing Tom Fields for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We are in Stillwater at Tom   s home, not far  from campus. Tom, you   re Muskogee and Cherokee, a photojournalist  and a video producer, but you   ve also done fine art photography for  many, many years. Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Well, I was born in W.W. Hastings Hospital in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, in  1951. I sort of grew up all over Eastern Oklahoma. My father was a  minister, so wherever he went, of course, I was there. (Laughs) I lived in  Kansas, Oklahoma, lived in Grove, Oklahoma, live in Quapaw,  Oklahoma, lived in Baxter Springs, Kansas, which is across the border  from Quapaw. So, just Eastern Oklahoma, more or less.  What are your earliest memories of doing art?  Of doing art?  Of any kind.  Well, probably just making little houses, club houses, for the little  cowboys and Indians, as my Indians would attack the cowboys.  (Laughter) Actually, probably in my field of photography, I used to     my dad actually had a little instamatic camera. That   s kind of actually  how I started when I think back, back. Of course, back in those days in  his church, he would have slide shows, so that was always kind of fun  for me as a kid.  To see the slideshows?  Yes, to turn the lights off and watch the shots. Actually, that is kind of  5  Pearson  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  where my interest in photography started.  That   s interesting. How old were you then?  Oh, boy. I don   t really know. Probably in elementary school somewhere  and then just kind of still had that interest.  So, you   d borrow your dad   s   would he let you use that instant camera?  Well, yes, occasionally. Yes, I mean, it was just a little instamatic. That  was my earliest memory of shooting a photograph and actually seeing it,  the results.  At some point when you attended Quapaw High School, did you take any  art classes there?  I guess you could call them art classes. I really don   t know. It was a real  little school. There were only like thirty students in my grade. It was  probably your typical small town school   football, football, football.  Right.  Art really wasn   t a part of it, but we managed I guess, I think, to do  things. We had a teacher who was real, I guess, with it at the time. So,  we did some things, but I really don   t have memory of doing art in that  school. (Laughs)  In elementary or high school, basically.  Yes, my background really isn   t that I grew up doing that kind of thing.  It was something, probably, I came to later on in high school and that  kind of thing.  After high school what was your next move? What did you do?  Actually, I went to California as soon as I graduated, sort of got involved  in different activities, Indian youth activities, those kind of things.  There in California?  In California, like with the National Indian Youth Council, that group  there.  Oh, yes.  And then on into Los Angeles for a while. I stayed there right after I  6  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  graduated, so I got involved in that.  I saw you were a student at UCLA in 1969.  Yes, that sort of evolved out of Clyde Warrior Institute, which was a part  of the National Indian Youth Council back in that era. They had got this  big grant to do workshops, I think one in Boulder, Colorado, one, I  think, at Stout State, in Minnesota, and one at the University of  California. There were several of us Oklahoma people that were out at  the UCLA one. It was a summer workshop.  Any other photographers?  Not really. A lot of when I probably started   actually, I was more into  drawing at that time, pencil drawing, graphite. And that   s kind of  what   I could always draw pretty good. In fact, it kind of triggered my  memory here of I would always draw these cartoons in high school.  That   s what got me kind of in trouble a lot of time. (Laughter) Kind of  characters, almost like political cartoons of the principal or the teacher  or scenarios. I did do that kind of thing.  So the poli science major that you were going to start at UCLA, that was  not just something you thought about. You were pretty serious about  politics at that point.  Well, I think as serious as probably an eighteen-year-old can get.  (Laughter) And, simply, it was 1969, 1970, in California. There was a  lot of things going on, as you could say.  Exactly.  Of course, I was right in the middle of it. But it was interesting because,  as I think back on it, it was a time when a lot of Indian students were just  kind of getting involved in their understanding of who they were. In  California it is kind of another game out there, a lot of Paiutes, a lot of  Mission Indians, a lot of relocated second, third generation Oklahoma  Indians out there, a lot Athabascan and Inuit Indians. In fact, my best  friend at the time was an Inuit. I almost said Eskimo. I mean Inuit. He is  actually the one who recruited me to continue at UCLA. We were there  leasing like a fraternity house. The Clyde Warrior Institute leased a big  house. That   s kind of where everyone stayed. And actually, it was one  that was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, so it was really a fancy,  artistic kind of place, you might say. It was during that era that I got  recruited because they were trying to build their Indian programs. They  were looking for students to be there, so that   s how I ended up sort of  there, from that to there. (Laughs)  7  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  So, Alcatraz was happening. Were you using a camera when you  were   ?  I was using pencil and pad. I wish I did have a camera at that era. I  hadn   t really got the camera out at the moment. I was looking back on an  old sketch book I had (and I   m not even sure where it is now) of Joe  Bill, this Inuit guy, and there is this lighthouse behind him. I kind of  sketched him at one time. Yes, I was   we went out there. That was kind  of an evolution, that action that happened at Alcatraz. The people out  there had done it, I think, a year before, this symbolic thing. And I think  they did it even about a month before that, and Richard Oaks and all of  them connected, sort of, with all of these college students because at that  particular time, a lot of Indian college students from these different  campuses, up and down California or from Berkley to UC Santa Cruz to  San Diego State, Long Beach State, UCLA, a lot of those that had Indian  studies programs and Indian student associations, we were having  conferences. So, it just kind of evolved into this activity, in November,  to sort of an action. So, that   s what happened.  Actually, we checked out a university car. I remember they were  Chevrolet Station Wagons. (Laughter) I forget how many we had, but  that   s how we ended up in San Francisco, ended up in Sausalito,  everyone took the boat over then to Alcatraz. And that   s kind of where  we   that   s how that particular, I guess, first discovery happened was  right then, that particular night, because at that point it stayed occupied  until the end. I think it was a few years later, went through a whole lot of  groups the students had. I am not sure how long, maybe a short term  compared to how it evolved over the time that it had.  Where did you head after California?  Actually, I came back home, came back to Oklahoma and got involved  with Oklahoma University. I got recruited by someone else to hang out,  to be there at OU, go to school there. So, that   s kind of how I stopped  here, I guess, was being a part of the program they had. At that particular  time, there was a lot of new programs, Indian student programs, that  were sort of in their beginning stages. That   s what a lot of it was, and so  they were always looking for Indian students.  Did you take any photography classes?  I hadn   t got totally photography yet. I was there and was still involved  in, more or less, political science classes, sociology classes, things of  that nature. It was after that that I really started getting involved in  photography. I realized I probably   there was a lot of things going on,  8  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  and I am sure there are some gaps in there. (Laughs) When I finally did  get a camera, then it became a part of documenting in a way, where I  was, who I was around, because I found it real interesting, kind of, the  people. I wish I had picked it up even sooner. I wish I had picked it up in  the late    60s and    70s because even what I have now is historical in the  sense that a lot of the people that I was around and could have  photographed or have, since then, have passed away or certainly  changed. Fifty years is almost like another world, basically, back then.  Exactly. Do you remember how you got your first camera or where you  got it, what kind it was?  I think probably the first time that it really took me to still photography  was, back in the    70s, I got involved in a documentation project, a video  documentation project. This was back in about    76, I think. Actually, I  was working, I think, in a program with the Osages, back in the old Title  IV days, and documenting, back in the old days, video days, I got  involved with a group, a project that was out of D.C. The whole premise  of that was,    Okay, a lot of tribes have all this equipment that was  bought. We   re going to bring you up here, we   re going to train you,  we   re going to send you back out to the tribal hinterlands, and you are  going to use their equipment. You   re going to videotape whatever, an  event, document, whatever. And then we   ll bring it all back up here and  edit it and archive it.    So, that was the basic premise of it. We did a lot  of that, did some of that. That is kind of where I got involved in  videotaping pretty heavily and enjoyed the use of the camera and kind of  what it can do and the editing process and that. So, that   s kind of how I  got into that.  Had you met Anita yet?  Not at that time, no. Probably the next stage, though, out of that   and I  bring this up because I got involved in it in Santa Fe   to a community  workshop council  that  was a film group. And, again, it was another  sort of, that era when there were large projects going on. And there was  another one in Appalachia, and the Indians have one and, I think, the  blacks had a project. I am not sure exactly where. I even think the  Asians had a project. So, the one in Santa Fe was the one I got involved  in. But actually, during that time, I was friends with a guy named Milo  Yellow Hair. He had a   I forget where he was working before, but he  had   well, he might have been there at IAIA, because that is kind of  where we housed out of, the Institute of American Indian Arts, in Santa  Fe. We just leased a building there.  During that project?  9  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  During the project, leased a building there. We weren   t actually students  of the Institute of American Indian Arts. Anyway, it was during that  time, I think, Milo had processed some film, and I was hanging out with  him and was making a print, running it through the chemicals, the  developer stuff. That was the first time I had really been around printing  photographs, was then. I was just intrigued. It was kind of   as I went  through the process, blank paper, expose it to the negative and the light,  and on and on. After that, I sort of really became more involved in  shooting and printing my own. That is kind of the really beginning  stages of my, I guess, real interest in using photography and making  printing and all that.  Did you sort of just watch what he was doing and experimenting?  More or less, more or less, because I wasn   t a student there. I wasn   t in a  photography class at that time. We were just kind of doing it. And, in  fact, we were in a film project. It wasn   t even a still photography thing.  Right. (Laughs)  We were just doing it because we had shot this film   or he had shot this  film, so then I started doing that. Then I acquired a camera, a Pentax 35-  millimeter camera, then started from that point on, using it and buying  film and shooting and that kind of thing. Let me see where I was. I have  to look at my resume. (Laughter)  In 1978, you were enrolled as an art major at Northeastern, I guess. And  at that point, photography really was your focus.  Yes, I got involved in that. I also got involved in going to a  photography   let   s see, I think, probably got involved in art class, yes.  Then I got involved in   funny thing about schools and universities for  me was I guess I was so uninterested, maybe, or focused in other areas  that it just didn   t work out well for me. (Laughter) So, I would go and  enroll and go to school and do the work, but it just wasn   t my thing. So,  I actually, after that, went to a specific little school in Tulsa that this  photographer ran. That worked better for me because it was just strictly  photography, about lighting and the technique, technology behind doing  the photograph. He was a portrait photographer, so he had a studio, and  he did a lot of work on some portraits. That was interesting for me and  something that I really needed to learn about lighting and all that kind of  thing, because it   s about lighting.  Who was it?  It was a photographer there. I think his name was   I can   t think of his  10  Little Thunder  Fields  first name, but he had a little school there called Sherack School of  Photography. He   d just run it out of his house, would have just, maybe,  four or five students. Something like that. It was more    Which was  good, because it was one-on-one with this guy. I think he was from New  York, originally. He lived down there. He knew his stuff. He knew his  business and, for me, that   s what I wanted to know. That   s what I  needed to hear and learn.  Were you exposed to the works of any other photographers while you  were at NSU or elsewhere? Did you see any shows by other  photographers that made an impression on you?  Well, probably the impressions were made even earlier, as I look back,  also. And one of them was, of course, LIFE magazine, the black and  white photography that LIFE magazine used to do. One of my favorites  was Eugene Smith. He was a life photographer back in the era. I think  one of the photographs that really struck me was the one he did of  documenting the chemical pollution in Japan, at this village called  Minamata, and the birth defects of the kids that were being born. And he  has this picture of this mother in this bath, and the lighting was almost  coming through the top, holding her son. He   s was really deformed. He  was born deformed. And that picture just had a lot of power. The way he  printed it, also, was these real vivid blacks and these lights, because  black and white is a tonality thing, and how you control that really  controls how people respond to it a lot of times. So, that right there, I  really started looking at his work and wanted, sort of, that technique, that  style, that emotion that he did. That   s kind of what I liked, also.  So, looking at LIFE magazine back in that era, that was kind of what  caught my interest also, was that. He also did a photograph, I remember,  it was sort of turned into calendars. It was these two   his kids, actually,  were holding hands, walking out of the, looks like the way he printed it,  this dark forest in there and the light, they   re real little. I have seen it  reproduced as calendars, illustration calendars. And I remember my  grandmother having a calendar with that illustration on her wall, in her  room. So, I always remember looking at it. Then when I saw them  photographed, I realized that was probably either inspired by that or that  was inspired by that, one of the two. But that was another photograph  that I really liked that he did and the way he printed it. He has done a lot  of other things, but that was one of the most intriguing.  The other one for me was Mary Ellen Mark, a New York photographer.  And I did take some workshops under her, met her, and got critiqued by  her and things like that. Her style is black and white, her photographs.  And she says   she photographs the fringes of society, the subcultures.  She did this piece on the prostitutes of India. That   s very serious work  11  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  when you get into places like that. She did these pieces on the children at  a mental hospital in Oregon. She did some pieces on the runways in  Seattle. In fact, she did a film with her husband on that. But all these are  very real, powerful kinds of photographs, and they   re really  documentary-type photographs, where they are a whole story, but they  are a series of almost like   to me, I call them freeze frames because the  thread is just kind of moving though. You   re just looking at images that  were taken.  She had a real knack, for me. Every time I would look at one of her  pictures it was like,    Wow  How did she get that?    To me, when I am  trying to learn and that is the only way you really learn, I think, in  photography, is doing and studying. And looking at her work, it really  challenged me to,    How did she get that?    That   s what I had to answer  and resolve. And then, certainly, when I met her, she was an interesting  person. She was a New Yorker, so she was really high energy, kind of a  fast talking, fast eating type of photographer. (Laughter) I can kind of  see how she got that because she was very out there. You do have to  have a bit of, not attitude, but drive when you do some things because if  you don   t, you may not get what you were after. So, there is that little  element that I always try to have.  And that workshop was approximately late    70s?  It was probably   no, actually, that was a little later. I mean, I had  studied her work before, but I think it was probably in the    90s, even.  In the    90s, okay.  Yes, but I had seen her work for years and years and studied it. Actually,  she was at Quartz Mountain at an adult workshop, back in that era, back  when they had funding, they could bring in these really high-level  people. I couldn   t believe that she was going to be here. She does a lot of  other workshops, and I would like to take some under her. She does  really good critiques because she looks at work and will tell you what  your strengths are. And then look at you like,    Well, why are doing you  this?    At my first critique, I thought you had to have all these things,  landscape, this, this, this, and this, to be a complete photographer. She  looked at my work and told me what my strengths were and asked me  why I was doing this. And,    I don   t know.    (Laughter) But, I mean,  that   s what you need. You have someone to really     So, was she kind of talking about subject matter at the point?  Oh, in a way. I think I was just trying to do just general landscapes,  outside landscapes, nice. I think those have value and things for place,  12  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  depending on what you are doing, but that definitely wasn   t my strength.  I mean, there   s a lot of people who really can do it well. She liked the  work I did with people, being able to, sort of, even document or  photograph within communities and people. That is what she liked and  responded to it.  She recognized that strength, yes.  Yes,    Do more of this.    She said,    That is what you need to do. Don   t be  wasting your time with this.    So, I took that to heart and did that.  You entered the Philbrook Art Show at one point, and your photographs  were the first art photographs to be accepted into this show. Do you  remember who the judges were that year? I am wondering if that was  sort of a battle that they fought.  I don   t even know, but that actually was in the era that I was at that  Sherack School, in Tulsa, that particular era. And I decided,    Yes, I   d  like to enter this.    I knew that show was coming up. I had been there  before and seen artwork and stuff. I thought,    Well, heck. I   ll submit a  photograph and see what they do.    There was no category, really. I  mean, there was no yes or no.    No you can   t,    or,    Well, here is a  category,    so I just kind of got in that like that because no one will say,     Well       (Laughter) It doesn   t say we can   t.  That   s wonderful.  So, it went under graphics. And the picture I actually shot was of Niche  Gray, who was an older Creek man. A friend of mine was his grandson,  Joe Sulfur. So, we brought him in, and we had him in this stickball  outfit. I was using the lights of the studio. Shot some scenes there, shot a  whole lot of different scenes. And the one I ended up using was   I sort  of did a triple exposure. One with him and, actually, the one with his  other grandson, Danny McKinney, they were both in their stickball   uniforms , which was basically just a felt, red tie and a breech cloth, but  holding the sticks. And then there was another young boy. So, it was like  three different generations. So, that was one we conceived, and then we  had to shoot it in camera. Like, adjust the shutter, but don   t move the  film, so you get triple exposures on it. That   s the one I used and  submitted. They couldn   t deny it. (Laughter)  Who has that photograph now? Did the Philbrook keep it?  Actually, Shelly bought it.  Oh, okay. (Laughter)  13  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  The technology, I think, probably, I hope it even still has color in it  because it was like in the    70s. How long ago was that? Thirty years ago.  I have the negative. I need to probably reprint it again and try to bring it  back to life.  That would be neat.  But the point of that was I was trying to put something different in that  category. And I wasn   t trying, really, to put myself     Open the door? (Laughs)  In the Indian art world. It just wasn   t there. I said,    Well, let   s do this.  Let   s put it there.    At that time, there wasn   t any photography category  anywhere. Where we actually tried to open a door was during Indian  Market, in Santa Fe, because there were a couple of other   about three  photographers when we first started to say,    You guys need to have a  category.    Because we   d bring it in, but there would be no category.  There would be nothing in the competition part of it. So, that door kind  of opened. There is a whole story to this, by the way, but anyway, that is  how it kind of evolved. Just people who do the work, asking,    Hey, you  guys should have a category and do this.    Well, now, you look at it and  there is a whole pretty good category. Sometimes it   s good and  sometimes it not, depending on who the judges are, depending on what  people contribute because it is still just a distinct group of artists, really.  It   s a relatively small group.  Yes, it   s not representative to me of the whole thing, because not  everybody goes to Santa Fe, not everybody wants to enter the  competition. Certainly, photographers, a lot of them don   t have the  resources or the money to do a lot of that, that are out in the hinterlands.  But at least it provided an outlet. Just like any painting or anything, there  is a lot of variables, a lot of variety, a lot of styles, a lot of different  things. It has been kind of interesting to see what evolved out of that.  We had discussed a bit the fact that they weren   t setting up. You did at  different times, a set-up, I guess, at arts and crafts shows with your  photographs at different Indian art shows. What were some of the  challenges you encountered?  I think, starting out, one thinks that they have to do art shows and sales  and things like that. I did a few, but the type of work I do where you are  photographing individuals in a community and stuff, it really doesn   t  lend itself to a marketable kind of market-type situation, where,    Okay, I  14  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  have this picture of so and so doing this. I want you to put it on your  wall, and I   ll sell it to you for X amount of dollars.    Another side of that  is even though people know I took their picture, Indians can get really  jealous if they think you are making a dollar from them or something,  even though you   re not. You   ve probably spent thirty, maybe, to make  ten. That, kind of, was a headache that I didn   t want to get into. And I  have done Indian Market in Santa Fe. I did that in the early years, again,  to get that category open, but I haven   t done it lately because it just isn   t  something that I enjoy. (Laughs) I don   t really   that market atmosphere.  The work that I do, actually, I like to do projects for specific either  publications or exhibits or shows, where the whole story can be sort of  looked at or understood and told.  By means of a series?  Yes, a series. Certainly, there are serious collectors out there, and I have  sold to people that certainly understand photography and have some  things. But just that market process was just something that I did not  like. And the old thing is if you don   t like it, don   t do it.  Right.  Why do that if at the end of the day you are all tight, thinking,    Argh   Dang people     I think the thing that put it over the line for me was  almost coming to blows with these people in the next booth, these  tourists, because they were all crowding into our booth. It   s just like,     Man      This is that part like    (Laughs)     Why tolerate and put up with this stuff when I don   t have to? I don   t  have to do that.    For some reason I did it. (Laughs) I just thought,     Nah.    So, I don   t think I went to Santa Fe the year after that. I just  wasn   t interested.  When and where did you meet your wife, Anita?  Let   s see, first time I met her I actually was in Denver. I was working at  a TV station up there, back    Oh, I don   t even remember the year.  (Laughs) But, anyway, I was working there. I knew her cousin and went  to a party. She was there. It was like, clear across, almost into Boulder,  and I was living like, almost downtown Denver. (Laughs) So, I had to  get back for some reason, and so she drove me back. So, that was kind  of the first time I met her. Then I actually met her again in Santa Fe. She  went to school at the Institute of American Indian Art, so I met her there,  again. So, that   s kind of where     15  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  When you were     Actually, I was living in Albuquerque.  Just dealing mainly with the photography?  No, actually, this was a different time   a different era, even. I  actually   a little later on, after that, in the    70s, probably the later     70s   or maybe   75 and    74, I think, I was in Albuquerque, working   I  was with some other friends of mine who were in a band called Exit. So,  I would help them with their equipment, lighting and various things and  do some photography for them. I would always go to Santa Fe a lot  because I knew a lot of people up there. And so, I think that   s when she  was in Santa Fe going to school up there, and that   s kind of where I met  her, up there, during that period of time. I spent a lot of time in New  Mexico. I really like New Mexico because there is a lot going on. That is  kind of why I ended up in New Mexico quite a bit.  You sort of explained the importance of workshops for you in terms of  developing your skills. Were you aware of the work of some of the  Indian photographers from like the    30s and    40s, like Horace Poolaw?  Had you been exposed to their work when you started?  It   s interesting, I really didn   t know about them that much. I don   t think  there was a lot of information that was out there publicly, like there is  now. I had met one gentleman, a Seminole man, who used to be an  Army photographer back in World War II. He was one of the few Indian  photographers that I knew. But, again, he was a photographer in terms of  he knew the craft, but he wasn   t doing the kind of things I did. I really  didn   t know that many Indian photographers. The guys I hung around  with shot a bit, but I didn   t go   or I couldn   t go to places and read about  them or study about them or research them because it was at that period  of time in the    70s. There just wasn   t a lot of people who were doing it  as a commercial basis or were professionally doing it or putting shows  out there. If there were I didn   t know about them. I think the more, now,  that I research back, there were a few, maybe enough on one hand.  (Laughs) Now, I have seen what they have done. It was pretty much just  a new game for me that I was just doing and looking at other  photographers, of course, but not necessarily Native photographers.  What was one of your more important group shows, one of your first,  sort of, group photography shows that was real important to you?  I think, certainly, of course, the Philbrook Art Show became one in the  beginning, I guess. It sort of opened a window, I guess, to people seeing  16  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  that there are photographers out there   a photographer or  photographers. And I certainly am not trying to claim any kind of credit  for anything, other than just I was doing that at that time and wanted to  just see what would happen if I   d enter a photograph. I actually thought  it wasn   t going to get in. I was surprised when they let it in. I   ve had  several shows down the line. I think the  only  one that had some at  Smithsonian or at the American Indian Museum. We Stole a Teepee, that  was the one where   it   s the one I   ve hanging back here, I think. That  was part of that show. I am trying to think of others right now.  We the People was one at the Oklahoma Arts Center in    83.  Oh, right, right. Quite a while ago.  Did that connect you with a couple of other Indian photographers that  you really supported?  Yes. The thing about photographers is we   re sort of very independent,  individual types. It   s not like we all hang out and go have a drink  together somewhere. (Laughter) I don   t know why, but mostly because  we are all very   it   s a very individual art. And I think when you are out  there doing it, you   re internally kind of working in your brain and  physically. So, it   s kind of funny when you think about it. But, yes, I   m  able to meet a few people there.  In the mid    80s, Anita decided she was going to take the plunge into  doing art full-time. That   s always a discussion between partners because  of the financial uncertainty that it brings. How did you guys work that  out?  Well, probably, I started working a little on different jobs at the  particular time because we had to pay rent, had to pay car payments, and  all that. So, I managed, actually, to find jobs, and it was intentional that I  find jobs where I had access to a dark room, for one, and the equipment.  Aha   So, I managed to sort of plot my career path and managed to find some  work in an area where I had access to all that. So, for me, it wasn   t like I  was working in a factory. And so, it wasn   t mentally that hard to do     stay there, let   s say. But I also knew that I needed to sort of keep a pay  check because we started to have kids. In    76, our first daughter was  born. So, that meant we needed to get serious and start a family and start  doing the things that you do like that. So, I just decided,    Well, I   ll  continue working as long as I can and have access to this.    So, that   s  what really allowed me to work, I guess, was because I was doing work  17  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  that I enjoyed, either photography or video or that kind of thing. That   s  what we did. We decided that I would,    I   ll just keep a job, continue  working.     And you were developing new technical skills, but at the same time, like  you said, you had access to the resources to do the fine art photography  on the side.  Right, and that   s a decision that we made there, but I do know that it  affects me in what I do. As I look back on some of the work I did back  then, I really feel I had a better eye, I guess you might say. Probably did,  probably a better reaction time. A lot of things you shoot for work in the  commercial market is that   s what that is, and you have to know how to  shift gears when you are doing your own work. A lot of strategies and  techniques can be sort of interworked photographically, but you have to  be very aware of your intent, and how it   s going to be used. Technically,  certainly, you are sort of doing the same thing, but the other part of it  is   I think the issue that I have with working and trying   because it   s  like I had a freelance business, because with photography you can do  that. And it allowed me to do that, and I did that and still do that. That   s  how I maintained all of my shows and stuff while having, let   s say an  eight-to-five that it does affect. Now, no one else may see that effect, but  I know that it had an effect. And the effect was if I had devoted full-time  to this, where would I have been in that photography realm? I think I   d  have been a lot further up or more body of work, but that   s just a lot of  trade off. There   s a lot of    if   s,    you know?  Right.  When you are living your life, and you can   t always look back on those     if   s.    I just sort of was looking at it, in a way, a technical perspective,  saying,    Man, I wish I would have or could have done a little more to  evolve this craft a little better.    So, that   s just the way it works  sometimes.  I hope that will come again here in the future.  Yes.  You talk about the importance in your work of having a kind of  metaphoric ground, and I wonder if you could explain what you mean by  that when you are photographing American Indian subject matter?  Well, I think any art work or any document or anything you have     poetry, writing   you sort of use metaphors to imply things or to  associate things with. When I photograph place, almost like a landscape  18  or people, I call it peoplescapes, in a way, humanscapes, human  landscapes. And I did exhibit some processes where   it   s kind of a  takeoff on what people call landscapes, and you just see ground or you  will see a place, which is good. But, for me, it   s the people that are on  there, it   s the people who live there, it   s the people whose identity is  based out of there.  You could take an Indian to Europe and eventually he   ll end up on the  same ground that he sort of started in, was born, or lived at because  that   s kind of what pulls him back. That   s his community. So, in that  respect, that   s kind of what that was about. It was my statement about  trying to understand what that is and what   s in that Indian psyche. And  the reason I really felt I needed to do that, understand it, as a  photographer or artist, that is kind of what you are doing. You are  always presenting either an image   and that   s what a photograph is. It   s  a still image. It   s either a piece of paper or whatever, but it captures a  moment in time. That time, to me, is sort of a continuing process. For  me to capture a highlight, you might say, or something that I wanted to  show, I had to sort of understand a lot of that.  A good example, I had to shoot a ropes course one time. I didn   t really  know what I was doing, so I decided,    Well, I want to be a ropes course  instructor to understand it.    I did that, and it helped me understand and  get my work. It   s kind of that realm where to understand what you are  photographing, in some respects you really have to immerse yourself  into whatever you are doing. Now, the Indian world, I grew up in it. So,  I understood parts of that, but it   s so vast, so big and complex, all these  different tribes and different communities, you can   t just generalize  everything. So, one has to sort of go place to place and ground to  ground. That   s kind of what that metaphor was all about, sort of coming  out of a landscape photographer to the human landscape. This is what it  is. This is us. This is people. This is where we are. This is where we live.  This is how we live.  The photographs are just a way   I think as a photographer there is just  one job I have. If I had a job description it would be to show people a  whole new perspective of whatever it is I am shooting   people, place,  animals   to give them a new perspective, something that they   ve never  seen before. That can be just perspective and how you put your camera.  A camera is only a metal object. It   s how you see it or the time of day. If  you look at   let   s say the reality is this core, here, you have this sphere,  you might say, where you can put a camera. And then within that even,  the time of day, so the mathematical variables of what you could  actually push that shutter at are just   they   re pretty high. So, that   s the  options one has. (Laughs) That   s kind of what it   s all about when I talk  about that.  19  Little Thunder  Fields  I think that ties into what you also wrote about on your resume, which is  sort of this idea that if you   re just shooting for non-Indians, these  moments of ceremony or dance or whatever, a powwow, that is very  dramatic, and it   s very compelling. And those are the images that people  like to see, and yet, if you don   t get those quite everyday moments, which  are like 99.9 percent of life, you are kind of missing the whole picture.  For me it is. Actually, I am trying to think if I ever shot for   I really  don   t. When I shoot a picture, it   s for myself, always, even though I may  get a paycheck from somebody else. So, I don   t cross the line of   I   m  not hired to gun, let   s say, by non-Indians to go into an Indian  community to pull something out. I wouldn   t shoot anything that I  wouldn   t shoot personally because actually, a photographer, he has his  craft, his skill, his abilities, also your reputation. The key to getting a  type of photograph in a community with people is that trust. If you break  a trust, they are not going to let you in. You can   t get that photo   yes,  you can get a photograph. I can stand over here and shoot this and this  and this. It   s just going to look like another Oklahoma tourism shot, to  me. I wouldn   t be satisfied. I would leave.  Again, that is a part of my angle, my uniqueness, the way I see my job, I  see my craft, is to always have that core value, I guess, of doing that.  Now, this is not something that I read aloud or carry a card with me, but  over the years it is something that I really stick with because, yes, I   ve  made mistakes in the early years of my career, doing things when I was  really learning and trying to figure out how and why this works and why  that doesn   t work and how to work within communities. And it   s never  easy. There is never anything easy. Just like the other day, I was at a  wild onion dinner at a church way out in the sticks out there. I could  have stayed in the hall and took pictures of that, but I didn   t want to. I  went to camp house, stayed there, ate, and then started shooting from  there. (Laughs) I had my camera with me because I am never  somewhere   I want people to know that, yes, I am a photographer. I am  not trying to clandestinely come in here and snap something behind your  back, and so I always have it, and that   s why I have it on me. So, it   s  obvious. But then I start shooting when people are comfortable, and I  talk to them, and they know what is going on. That   s when I say  photography can begin, and that   s kind of where, in a way, the story  begins for me and my stories that I interpret or try to share with people,  let   s say, about this moment.  Let me just say a little bit about that. The moments for me in Indian  communities, to me, are so powerful and precious. This is why I think  that drive for me to really try to get at that core   now, this all sounds  kind of crazy, but if you are not a photographer, and you don   t  20  Little Thunder  Fields  understand kind of what you are doing    One has to give themselves a  job. One has to tell the perimeters of it, a job description, and then you  have to, to the best of your ability, go do that. So, it   s kind of second  nature to me now, after doing it for forty years and  having  evolved it.  So, I am able, actually, to grab a camera, go out, and have all this with  me, hanging there, no one sees it, but there is a method to what I am  doing. It   s not just   usually, again, I separate it out. If that   s what I am  doing, that   s what I do. It carries all of that with me. If I am just shooting  snapshots, that   s what I do also because it is just a camera. That allows  me then to tell the bigger story, to get the people who are a part of that  story because the native story or the native narrative is a thread. It isn   t  just bump, bump, bump, bump. That   s kind of why I like projects. You  are telling a story. You are telling the part where people are preparing, or  cooking or eating or talking or sharing   all these elements that are part  of who we are as a people. And so, that, once I sort of   I   ll shoot until I  think,    Wow.    I am spent, physically spent, and then almost  emotionally, because I feel,    Okay, I   ve got something here.    I feel good  about that, and that   s when I   ll call it,    Cut.    I will go,    Cut     when  we   ve got what we are doing. (Laughter)  Tell me about your project you have photographing Creek churches,  documenting Creek churches. Who initiated the project?  Well, it was one of those projects that I had been wanting to do for  years. It was certainly all self-funded by me. And the main reason is  because I wanted total control of it. I did get some funding for framing at  the very end, but that was for that part of it. Like I said earlier, I sort of  grew up in churches in that part of it  the world  when I was younger.  And so, as I got older, in my photographic career, I have always wanted  to do a project about that. In a way, it   s kind of like a writer   s novel.  You   ve always got that little novel or whatever you need to write about.  Now, one thing I do want to make real clear, I am not a historian, I am  not a writer. I am a photographer, so that   s what I do. It can get very  confusing out there sometimes when you are out doing projects and  in   communities.  One thing I do on my photographs, I always sort of get the facts of what  I am doing, where I am at. Part of that is so it   s almost like a historical  document. And that   s what this project was about, was to document the  Creek churches. But it was from the perspective of not what Christianity  did to the Creeks, but how Creeks adapted it to their own needs. And  just that by itself is quite a bit, but the history of it is pretty big. And it   s  the history of this country, it   s the history of a removal process. A lot of  churches that were there were established in 1870s, 1840s, and    50s,  some of them. Or in the early part, there were some that were   Creeks  had interactions with missionaries back in the early 1700s, and there  21  were some that were on their side, the Presbyterians for example.  To me, it provided a vehicle of history. But more than that, I wanted to  show the people I am a photographer. I can   t photograph, let   s say, 1870  today, but I can photograph the people, the descendants of people from  1870, and why they do what they do in their ceremonies. A lot of things,  I think, growing up, there was a dichotomy in our tribe. You   re a  Christian, you   re a traditional Stomp Dance leader. I think that was  something that was perpetrated by white missionaries a lot. I mean,  ultimately, we all probably have the same god, the same creator. In fact,  in the traditional world, the concept of the creator or giver of life or  breath was something that the Creek people could understand when they  talked about Christ over here on this side, as opposed to Hisagitaimisi on  this side. So, there was that element, but I think there was also an  element of culture being destroyed at that time, during that period of  removal where one didn   t know if they were even going to survive the  day, more or less.  I think all human beings have a need to feel comfort, safety, and I think  Creek people certainly had an understanding of the creator and praying.  And that   s what this project was. It was about praying people, but I took  it and wanted to show the people who are a part of this community  today, when I start shooting it. I think there are just so many elements  there that are historical, are powerful in terms of what they do, how they  do it, and why they do it. I think everyone in Oklahoma has heard a  Creek singing, church singing. I mean, it   s just kind of integral to part of  it. And so, it was some of that, but I just wanted to show the people that  were there. So, I went to a lot of churches and basically, would just show  up and tell them what I was doing. They are really involved in what  they   re doing, their day-to-day thing. And as long as I didn   t interrupt  pretty much, they    I remember one time I went to a church, and the  lady asked me what took me so long to get there. I had never met her,  but I understood what she was talking about.  So, I was very well received. I don   t really recall any negative part of  that, but on the other side of that, too, as a photographer, it was  challenging. I always say as a photographer you   re probably 30 percent  photographer and 80 percent psychologist diplomat. All the other  elements because I am having to talk to people, having to talk to people  that don   t know me. The good thing about some of that was they did  know my dad some, so that was kind of an in. I would also travel some  places with another minster sometimes, several of them that I knew and  they knew what I was doing. I would kind of hop along with them  wherever they were going and would go to places. That experience  became, sort of, for me, a way for me to understand it better, that history  part. And I   m talking about Creeks who are full bloods. They speak  22  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Creek in that church, they sing these hymns. Most of them are elders  because a lot of young people are doing other things. So, it was  interesting in that respect. This project was a way to photograph that,  and it was done over a period of several years to show people what this  community was about, what they do, what it looks like on that day, what  they look like. So, it was just a way to bring that piece of our Indian  world to the forefront and let people look at it.  Those are some wonderful pictures, too, and we are going to look at  them at the end of the interview. You have always pretty much worked in  black and white. What do you like about black and white photography?  Well, I think photographers are kind of like ducks, whatever we see first  when we come out of the water, that becomes our mother. (Laughter)  So, that first image I saw being developed was a black and white image.  But on the other hand of that, to me, there is a real craft in printing a  black and white picture. If you look at   when you see my photographs,  back in the dark room days, it could take me several hours. And I used to  print at night and would print all night. It took me a lot of test strips and  a lot of burning and dodging to getting that right tonality because I like  the black blacks, I like the white whites, to really bring that kind of  contrast, even that emotion that comes with it. And black and white, it  certainly has, to me, more emotion. Color is great, but it has a different  realm to it. Black and white just speaks to me a little better. There is  more work involved in it, and I like it. Shifting into to the digital era, I  still had to learn everything with Photoshop and everything else to arrive  at where I did with a chemical print, let   s say, in a chemical process   a  similar type of intense, but a whole different way to arrive there.  What about filters? Do you like to use filters quite a bit?  Not always. I always try to just be like, a straight photographer, you  might say. I do, really, a lot of special effects. The only time I ever really  did was using an infrared film. Of course, with that, to get the kind of  shot you want, you do have to use like a twenty-five A or a deep red  filter. But ultimately, it   s printed as a black and white. That   s probably  the only time I ever really did, other than just contrast filters or  polarizers that use with a lens just to get different contrasts. I was never  really into like, special effects-type of photography. I wanted straight  out. In fact, I did a lot of full frame for a while, were you   d see the on  the carrier over the enlarger. It had a little area where you put the  negative and then it would project down. I filed a lot of that out because  I wanted the edge of the film to be printed on the paper.  What I was trying to do there was forcing myself to see everything full  frame, right? So, whatever this camera saw, that   s what it was. Not that,     Oh, I like this. I am going to crop this section out of it.    No, it was,  23  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields     This was it,    and I had to shoot that to get what I wanted out of it, and  that   s what a lot of that was. At that particular time, it was even a  challenge for me to make sure that I was aware of what was in this  corner, that corner, that corner. Photography, again, it   s that  mathematical possibility. One little degree can change the whole thing a  lot of times. You always had to be aware of that. That   s the technical  side of a photographer, complete with everything else you are trying to  do this way, and then everything else that is going on in front you. You  still have to be a technician ultimately. So, yes, it   s     And you present them. I mean the black frames, the white matting, a very  classic look to your presentation.  I always like to   well, again, I think a lot of what I was wanting to do  was to put it in that realm of fine art, in a way, because I think that is  where people kind of stop and really look into the window, people who  really appreciate those kinds of things. Again, it   s there, but it was kind  of like a window, a nice dressed window. It   s just,    Okay, I am stopping  and looking at this. I wonder what happened before. I wonder what   s  going to happen afterward.    It   s just one little   boomp  So, I want to  present that as good, clear, and concise as I can and kind of pull people  into that, the image, whatever it is, whatever it   s about because that was  the important thing, to me, was what was going on there.  You did an exhibit in 2003 called Native Fields. Is it focused on your  family or kind of a play on words?  Actually, it was, yes.  And how did you get the idea? What were some of the things that you  shot for that?  Well, actually, it was a show out of Paseo in Oklahoma City. It was kind  of a play on words. We actually had a website called Native Fields, and  so we sort of just took to call the show that. That   s where myself and my  son, Yatika, who is a painter, and Anita, her clay, we sort of had a joint  show. And that   s kind of how that evolved.  Oh, cool.  Yes, also, we had a gallery down at Oklahoma City in the Paseo District.  It   s always interesting to collaborate. I mean, me and Anita have been  artists all our lives. Our son, my first son, he is a painter now. My other  son, he   s a musician. He plays. He can do art. He   s making this octopus  right now for a performance by a band that they are going to do.  24  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Wow. (Laughs)  It is kind of like performance art. They have all been, sort of, raised in a  very open and creative process. Like when my youngest son was  growing up, we didn   t give him a curfew. He actually didn   t need one,  and the reason why was because every other kid had one. So, when they  had to go in, he had to come home because that was his ride. (Laughter)  So, what else could he do? But you do have to let them do their thing.  And they have been going to Santa Fe and art shows since they were  babies. So, they have been around art. They understand what it is, in a  way, not just Santa Fe, but a lot of other places. Yatika is learning the  business of art because it is a business when you get into the realm of  being a professional artist, the business side of it, which is a whole  different game by itself. So, he is learning that. That has been good for  them to grow up and see, kind of, this side of how art and that  expression of art can actually be a career, and you can make a living on  it and not harm anyone, not hurt the earth, and make good friends with it  and have a good time. (Laughter) That   s good for them.  You   ve done quite a bit of teaching, both of photography and video.  What do you try to pass on to students in those areas?  Yes, I did summer schools and stuff and teaching. I teach from the  perspective of how I would have liked to have been taught. (Laughs) I  try to keep it fun and interesting because when you are working with  young kids, if it isn   t, they turn you off in a second. I think I remember  my very first experience in front of a classroom. I think within thirty  seconds of that moment, I am thinking,    What the heck did I get myself  into?    But I just applied the,    What would I like? What would I want to  learn?    And then, of course, if you   re teaching video photography, I  want them certainly, technically, to learn about the technique and the  process. I don   t start there, though. Actually, I start with a group of  people by fun and games outside or something, doing something,  exercise, getting to know each other. And that   s what it is all about  because I want them to understand human relations at a young age and  how using and introducing the camera is part of that. So, I want them to  feel comfortable to be around each other.  I also teach them how to sort of learn the language of photography, to  talk about it. If I ask you this question,    Why did you take that picture?     I want them to at least be able to explain to me why they took the  picture. I do not want to hear,    I don   t know,    because that   s not a  reason, you understand. It   s part of that, the,    Snap, Snap,    is just a  small part of what the photography is all about. After we sort of get into  a lot of that, then we do a lot of shooting and then critiquing. Shooting  and critiquing, that   s what I do a lot of when I teach is shooting and  25  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  critiquing because I really want them to see what they got, critique it in a  positive manner, and then go do some more and critique again. So, you  sort of, ultimately, arrive experientially at someplace, somewhere that  you are comfortable doing this.  Now, it   s a lot easier with digital photography because you can use  project, PowerPoint, and all that. Back in the black and white days it was  a little harder. We used to use a lot of slides back then because you  could take them out to the lab and get them back the next day, so it was  easier teaching-wise to project and see it immediately. If it was more  than that, they   d probably get bored and go to a clay class or something.  But I had to keep them interested and keep them understanding what  they were seeing. Most of them that were in my classes sort of wanted to  be there. I mean, they wanted to learn some of that. I think the  generation today has been photographed probably more than any. It  started it out, parents photographed them, but now they photograph  themselves. There is a whole genre of pictures that I take in my camera,  me and my buddies. I mean, you could look on Flickr or anywhere and  just see thousands, which are real interesting. I find they are real  interesting, what they do. So, the evolution of technology has made  photography a whole other kind of world than when I started with it. I  just teach interest in it. They   ll figure out how to do what they want to  do with it.  Artists hardly ever retire, but they might retire from their paying job to  do art full-time. Do you have some plans when you do retire to work on  some more projects?  Actually, I do. I have a whole bunch of notebooks with negatives in  there.  Cool.  Now, back in the old days, I would shoot and make a contact sheet, and  maybe I may print one or two out of that. I have a lot of negatives that  I   ve never printed anything from, just maybe made a contact sheet. So, I  have a really resource of things that I would like to look at and maybe  print some more or maybe do another exhibit from different eras there  and see what I can get. Now, what happens, when I have started   well, I  have started scanning a lot of these negatives on a digital scanner. And  once you get them into that form, then you take them just like you do  digital photographs now, Photoshop, whatever you need to do, and print  with a printer. There is a lot that I have that I am going to really try to  get into. I   ve got a lot of negatives.  Sounds wonderful. Looking back over through your career so far, what  26  Fields  Little Thunder  has been one of the high points?  Oh, boy. (Laughs) I think the high point of my career is actually, doing  that church project. That was kind of an evolution, or any project that I  would finish. That one, I basically self-funded and did it, completed it,  had an exhibit. That was satisfying to have. And it   s always satisfying  even just to make a good photograph that   s been maybe seen somewhere  or part of an exhibit because in the scheme of things, you   ve created or  shown people something they   ve never seen before. Those are  interesting.  I   ve had stuff in different publications, different exhibits. There is a  photograph that I have in an exhibit coming out of the New Orleans  Museum called the Art of Caring, and they produced a book. Their  premier photographer was   they have a lot of very high-end  photographers in this show, so I was very thrilled to be part of it. Things  like that, things where work is actually shown and actually produced. I  really like that. Again, my peer group is not Native artists. It   s  photographers, worldwide, international. I continually am just totally  intrigued by the work people are doing all over the world and  documenting communities and things that are going on. But then I look  back on our own people here. To me, that   s just important. And that   s a  lesson I learned a long time ago. People think,    Well, why are you  taking pictures of just your family or people you know?    I say,    Well, a  National Geographic photographer is over there taking pictures of the  same people.    (Laughter) And I know them better than him.  It   s part of the critique that even early on, take pictures that your  strengths are. And the strengths are people that you care about. One of  the probably most import things, I think, that I   ve learned and a part of  this scenario that I do when I shoot is, you have to have sort of an  emotional commitment to your subject. That   s why I try to get within  that space where they are because they have to see me as a person. I  mean, it works photographically, otherwise they   d shut down, and they  look like it. They don   t share that interaction. When I talk about sharing,  I just mean that part of where they   re acting naturally, they are doing  what they would be doing normally to the extent that there is a camera  and a guy over here with it by them, and we talk about it before I start  shooting a bit. But that   s what that is. They feel comfortable enough to  do what they do. I always enjoy that piece of it, that part of it. That   s  what I think is really what I enjoy most, is that, even if it   s a small  moment or even if it   s something in the New Orleans Museum of Art.  To me, these are just as powerful as something over here.  Well, is there anything before we look at your work that we   ve forgotten  to talk about or anything you   d like to add?  27  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Boy, I   m not sure. Well, it   s 2011. The craft, the art of photography has  really just jumped leaps and bounds  from  when I started back in the     70s. I find it very interesting, digital photography. I remember when  that discussion was had,    Is it film or digital?    For some reason, it was  kind of like a dilemma for some people. But it   s all just a tool.  Ultimately, the end product is that story or something.  Well, let   s go ahead and take a look at your pictures. We   ll just leave the  camera and the audio running. And, maybe, let   s start with this piece.  I   ll just refocus. You don   t need to be in the picture, Tom, but you can  talk about the piece, just a couple sentences about what you were  thinking, et cetera. We   re ready to go on this one.  This particular photograph was from a series on where was I back   I  shot it actually, back, I think, in the    70s. There was always something  that you would see, that stereotyped Native people all the time. So, this  was a ride at the fair. And this little boy was in this canoe going around  this water, here.  Oh, man.  And they had these Indians. I forget what they call it, Frontier  something. But there is this Indian and this typical pose with a  tomahawk. So, I thought that was kind of     Right.  So, this kid, right here, to me, this is what he   s learning. This is his  education, right here, is what Indian people are.  Did you shoot this in another state?  Actually, this was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the Tulsa Fair Grounds.  Oh, wow  (Laughter) I almost asked if it was at the Tulsa Fair Grounds   You would be surprised, kids this age, that   s what they are learning. And  that is what they know.  Let   s take a look at the next one.  How about this one? That kind of goes along with it.  Yes, I love this one.  28  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  This photograph was part of a larger project that I did on photographing  all the Head Starts at Cherokee Nation. There are fourteen counties in  Eastern Oklahoma, all the way up to Delaware County, up north, all the  way down to Arkansas and almost over to Tulsa. In different Head Starts  they would have graduations. So, this was at Lost City Head Start. This  was a little boy graduating. And, of course, his grandmother and mother  and sister are in that frame. So, I just thought it sort of said a lot of  things right there. I always liked it.  Really lots of emotion in there, a wonderful piece. Oh, we were going to  do the Creek Church and then that Ribbon Dance one, I think, if you  want.  I don   t think it   s going to fit in there too well, but I   ll try to keep it up.  Yes, well, that   s not too bad, actually. Want to tell us about this one?  Well, this is part of the series I was doing on Indian churches. This,  actually, was a Cherokee church in Lone Prairie, which is around Little  Kansas, Oklahoma. Actually, this particular church has a lot of personal  meaning because my relatives went to church here. I went to church here  when I was very little. My grandmother, great-grandmother, and great-great-  grandmother went there. Actually, I think it was started in 1876.  It   s beautiful.  Of course, this is not the same building, but I shot it with infrared film  because I wanted a real dramatic effect out of it. So, that   s one the  reason why it sort of has that look. So, that   s basically it. This was a  photograph I took inside of a Creek church. I did a whole series, a  project on Creek churches and the people and the communities there.  This particular church is one of the older types, where the men sit on one  side and the women sit on the other side. One thing that is very familiar  certainly, with even traditional churches, the doorways always face east  because they always said Christ will come from the east when he returns  back to earth, which is a very similar concept to a lot of old traditional  beliefs. Even in sunrise ceremonies, the creator comes from the east. So,  I think you see it in a lot of traditional churches, even some of the old  traditional types of beliefs that have sort of evolved over the years since  then.  This is at a church called Alabama Quassarte, east of Watonga,  Oklahoma, about six miles. It   s a very small one. That   s basically how it  is. It works   there is a bench here, and certainly, when they have the  alter call, they   ll go up there. But they are singing right now, so this is  part of that. There is a very distinct order that people sat. The the first  29  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  lady sits here, the elders, and then it sort of goes on that way. And the  same goes with the men, and the preachers will sit in the back. So, there  was structure to how they do what they do. The thing about why I was  wanting to photograph some of this on this project is to learn some of  that and photographically, kind of capture some of that. I know a lot of  younger Creek people that are in churches don   t understand that element  of it. They   ll do things, but they don   t know why.    Why do you do  that?    and they don   t know that. So, even in these communities as  generations and elders pass on, they still don   t know a lot. The younger  people don   t understand a lot of it. So, I just wanted to sort of do a photo  project that would at least bring importance or bring out what they do, in  hopes that maybe some younger people will start wanting to learn more  about why and who and all that. So, that   s what this particular shot was,  but it   s a larger series.  This picture was taken in a camp house at that same church that same  day. After services, let   s say Sunday services, everyone will eat at a  camp house, a typical Creek traditional grounds. It   s sort of a church in  the middle and then different family camp houses around it, much  similar to a tribal grounds somewhere or a tribal town, a similar  situation. When these churches were established a long time ago, people  had to arrive by covered wagon, so you stay there for an extended  amount of time and were fed there in these houses. So, all the guests will  be fed in those houses. Usually, right before lunch the deacons come and  will tell you what number to go to, which camp house, and they sort of  divvy up everybody. So, we were in this camp house, and they were  having a full meal. And I just liked the scene that was going on there  with the tapestry of The Last Supper there     Yes.  And then the minister here, and then people eating     A really nice photograph.  Which is a common theme in any culture is sharing a meal.  Yes, certainly.  So, I just sort of liked that. How about this one?  We can do that one. You want to wrap up with that one?  Yes. This photograph was taken at a Creek tribal town, Hillubee. It was  actually on a Friday, when Ribbon Dance was going on during Green  Corn. It hadn   t really   well, it had started and so, this young lady   s  30  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  getting her little sister ready, combing her hair, getting her ready to  dance. And I like to shoot things of that nature. To me, the action, the  circle of action is extended out further by what people are doing or  around. A lot of times people maybe think this is just what   s going on,  but I like what   s going on all around. So, that   s why I framed it like I  did, and I shot it with infrared film to give me more of a real, intense,  surrealistic look. Again, technique and strategy, you might say. I always  have people in my photographs, usually.  You   ve got some great textures and shades there, tones.  Yes, so, that was basically that.  Well, thank you very much for your time today, Tom. I enjoyed it.  Yes.  -------  -------
