 Little Thunder  Martin  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is January 5, 2013, and  I   m interviewing Muscogee Creek artist Bobby Martin as part of the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project, sponsored by the Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Bobby   s  studio in Tahlequah by the Illinois River. Bobby, you   re currently an  associate professor of art at John Brown University. You also taught at  Northeastern State University. You   ve been involved in the Native art  scene for many years, combining personal imagery with social and  cultural statements in multiple exhibits around the country and abroad.  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  My pleasure.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, where we are now, at the W. W.  Hastings Indian Hospital. I grew up most all my life in Tahlequah from  literally   well, we moved around a little bit until I was five. Then my  parents moved back to Tahlequah when I was five, and then went  through the Tahlequah school system from kindergarten on through high  school. Then I went to Northeastern here for a couple of years and then  dropped out of school. I   ve been in Tahlequah for almost that whole  time with a few little stints a couple other places. Except for maybe three  or four years here and there, I   ve been in Tahlequah the whole time.  What did your folks do for a living?  My father was a counselor for the State Employment Service for the  State of Oklahoma for many years. That was his career. He passed away  in 2010. Had retired early, so he   d been retired for quite a few years. My  mother worked in the social services area, first for the Bureau of Indian  5  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Affairs when they had an office in Tahlequah. Then, when they moved  their offices to Muskogee, she worked there for a bit. She retired from  there and started working for the Cherokee Nation. She retired from  there, as well, after a couple of years. She worked for various  government agencies.  What about your grandparents on either side?  On my father   s side, they were both educators. My grandfather, my  dad   s dad, was superintendent of schools at a little school near Checotah,  Oklahoma, Onapa, which was where they lived. That   s my memories of  them, is going down to Onapa. There was a school down there until the  mid-   60s, and then they consolidated, I think, with Checotah Schools.  He was the superintendent of schools, and his wife, my grandmother on  my dad   s side, was the fifth grade teacher for many, many years. They  were both educators. Both had got their master   s degrees here at  Northeastern back in the    30s.  Then my mom   s side, her dad   Heron was their name. He was Ransom  Wesley Heron. He was a horse trader, general, kind of a whatever-he-could-  find-to-do. Owned several little stores, same area, around Onapa.  My mom   s mom, my granny, was full-blood Creek and spoke fluent  Creek, really more fluent in Creek than she was in English. They lived  on Highway 69, just about halfway between Onapa and Eufaula, and  that   s where they lived. She was a homemaker and did the garden and  kept the farm and all that stuff. That was my earliest memories, is being  on their farm down in Onapa.  What is your first memory of seeing art or perhaps Native art?  I think the first art that I remember seeing was not Native art. Probably  what got me interested in being an artist is my dad was sort of a hobbyist  artist, more of a cartoonist, really. He   d sent off for this correspondence  course on how to become a cartoonist. It came in these big spiral bound  notebooks and all these pages of how to draw these cartoon figures, how  to draw a face, and how to draw the figures in cartoon style. Of course, I  didn   t know anything about art at all, but I thought this was so cool. He  never actually finished the course, but I would take those books and try  and practice. That was my first experience with art, and it really stuck  with me for my life, I guess.  My first experience with Native art was   I was aware of Native art  growing up in Tahlequah because there is just a lot of it. What I thought  of Native art was the very traditional, flat-style art. Cecil Dick   s work  was around a lot. In fact, I   d see his work a lot in pawn shops and  different places. So I was aware that there was something different about  6  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Native art versus the art that I would see mostly in people   s homes.  My parents weren   t necessarily that interested in art. We didn   t go to  museums. We weren   t really brought up in any kind of artistic sort of  culture. I was aware of it, but I wasn   t really surrounded by it or in that  world, necessarily. It wasn   t until I got to college, really, when I started  being aware of it, way far down the road, as an adult.  And aside from your dad, no other extended family members that  dabbled in art or were interested in art?  Not that I know of. I think some of them   like my grandfather on my  dad   s side, he really liked to work with wood. I remember projects in the  summer. He   d have me and my brother help him build these little   I  remember building some little planter out of wood. It was a little cart  drawn by a mule, and we cut it out, (Laughter) those kind of things.  Nobody was formally trained in art, and nobody pursued art as any kind  of a living or hobby, really. We had a few relatives that I knew just from  being around them, like cousins, that were good. They liked to draw. I   m  really the only one that I know of that really pursued art in any kind of  professional setting.  And how about brothers and sisters?  I have one sister. I   m the oldest of three. I have a sister who is a year  younger than me, and a brother who   s three years younger than me. Both  of them still here in Tahlequah, but none pursued art although they are  both talented. My brother, especially, was a very good draftsman. He  drew very well, but didn   t pursue it. They   re still around here.  So what experiences with art did you have in elementary school?  Elementary school, not a lot. I don   t really remember too much except  maybe some little class projects. My first real memory of anything art-related  was probably when I was in junior high, probably seventh or  eighth grade. What was real popular then (this was probably in the mid-     60s) were these little trading cards that had hot rods with these monsters  popping out of the top of the hood, or they   d have these crazy monsters  with giant gear shifts sticking up like this. (Gestures) They   re still  popular in some areas. They   d come out in these, like, baseball-type  trading cards. My friend and I found that we were pretty good at copying  these, and so we would copy these little trading cards and then sell them  for like a nickel to all our fellow students. That was my first artistic     Your first art sale. (Laughs)  7  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin     yes, my first art sale, my first even, really, adventure into art and some  kind of realization that,    Wow, you can make art, and somebody might  actually want to have it.    It was fun. That   s the thing: I thought it was  interesting at the time that,    Wow, I can draw these things, and people  want them. They   ll actually give me some money for them     (Laughter)  How about high school? Did you have any art classes in high school?  I took art all the way through high school, mainly because I was good at  it and it was easy, but I didn   t have really any real interest in it. I just  found myself doing it. One of the things (maybe it   s common or not, I  don   t know) I had a good art teacher in those years, but she was fairly  restrictive on what you could do. Of course, I wanted to do other stuff,  and that felt, in my high-school way of thinking, real restrictive on my  artistic whatever, so I didn   t make very good grades. (Laughter) I would  do something that wasn   t following the rules correctly. I wasn   t very  serious at all. I did it because I was good at it and it was something I  knew I could do. I didn   t pursue it in any serious way at all.  So you go to Northeastern for college immediately after high school?  Yes, the first time. (Laughter) I went immediately after high school. In  fact, I went to summer school the summer after I graduated high school.  It didn   t even enter my mind to be an art major or anything like that, so a  friend of mine and I decided,    We   re going to be business administration  majors,    or whatever. I had no interest in that, but it was like,    Okay, I  could either go to school or go find a job, so I guess I   ll go to school.     So we went to school.  I went the summer, and then I went fall semester, and then I basically  dropped out in the middle of the spring semester. I was eighteen or  nineteen and was totally disinterested. By that point, I was more  interested in playing music and wanting to be a rock star. (Laughs)  That   s really where I went, was doing music a lot more before I was ever  interested in art. I dropped out at that point and didn   t ever go back until  many years later, to go back and finish my bachelor   s. I was in my early  thirties before I went back to school. I was a very non-traditional student  to finish up back in the early    90s, I guess, is when I went back.  So you   re playing music, but you   re not really doing any art on the side,  not really seeing any art?  No. I mean, art was pretty non-existent for me that whole period of  growing up. Every once in a while I might draw something or maybe  create a little greeting card, something just because I knew I could do it.  I could throw something together, but not pursuing it at all. I was really  8  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  serious about music, especially after I dropped out of college the first  time around. This would   ve been late    70s. Dropped out of Northeastern  to pursue my rock star career. (Laughs) Played in a lot of bands, ended  up being a professional musician for the next ten or twelve years,  playing in all kinds of bands around here.  Did you ever play up in Tulsa at the Leon Russell Church  Recording   Studio?  We never   no, actually. I didn   t get that serious about the business end  of it until a little bit later, probably in the mid-   80s. A friend and I   this  was back when bankers were a lot more lenient than they are now. We  went in with no jobs, no real security of any kind and asked for some  money to start a recording studio. He actually gave us some money, and  so we started this little demo studio, downtown Tahlequah. We started  recording our own music, and then we   d have people coming in and  recording bands, nothing very serious.  My original partner eventually dropped out, and he sold his part to an  older gentleman. That   s where I met people like Kevin Smith, Tom  Skinner, a lot of guys that are still playing music around Tulsa. They  would come. They were in that same circle that I was, and they would  come down and record. This was twenty-something years ago, and so we  did a lot of recording, played a lot of music, and wrote a lot of songs.  That was my life for a dozen years or so, mostly in the    80s. That was  what I pursued, and art was not even in the mix, really. I mean, I did a  few little projects. I created a little logo for the studio, things like that  because I could and I didn   t have any money to pay anybody else to do  it. I would do that, but as far as art or being exposed to art or pursuing  art, music was my life for that decade.  So what led you back to school and into an art major?  A few different things. Probably one of them was starvation. (Laughter)  I went from wanting to be a starving musician to a starving artist. I don   t  know how smart that was. I had just met Stephanie, who is now my  wife. We   ve been married for twenty-two years now, but then we were  playing in a band together, and we decided that we wanted to get  married. At the time, she was the bread winner of the family. It was clear  that I wasn   t going to make any money at this recording studio thing, so  that was kind of the time I decided,    Okay, I   m going to go back to  school,    and in the process of trying to figure out,    Okay, if I go back to  school then what am I interested in?     It really wasn   t a desire that suddenly was like,    Oh  I want to pursue  art.    (Snaps) It was like,    I do like art, and I   m good at art. I think I   ll try  9  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  and major in art just to see how it goes, to try it out.    Also, they had an  Indian studies program there, and so I thought,    Well       I was getting  more interested in trying to find out more about my family and my  background and what it meant to be a Native American, so I decided to  double major in fine art and Indian studies. That was in    89. I ended up  selling the studio and going back to Northeastern, picking it back up  after being out for, it   d been about twelve years or so.  So how important was your Creek culture growing up?  It was fairly invisible, really, as far as when you   re talking about  traditional culture. My mom was half Creek. We grew up in Tahlequah.  My parents moved to Tahlequah when I was about five, and so, of  course, we ended up being in the midst of the Cherokees as Creeks.  We would go down to visit my grandmother and all the aunts and  uncles, but they were not really involved in what you would think of as  traditional Creek culture. They were very involved in the Christian  church, Creek. My granny   s dad, my great-grandfather, was a Methodist  circuit riding preacher, and he was the main pastor at Deep Fork  Hillabee  Church  which is down in that area. I do remember going  down to some of the church grounds. Our family had their own camp  house. Usually it   d be on Easter or big holidays, and we   d go down.  That was more the culture. They were all Creeks, but it   s not what you   d  think of as traditional.  When I think about it now, though, it is still traditional culture. It is still  a traditional culture of growing up in a church. That   s my background as  far as the culture. Then, of course, I never really got into any kind of  Native church when we were in Tahlequah, and still not really. About  the same time that I went back to college to Northeastern and got  married, I also became a Christian in 1990. Since then, I   ve gotten more  involved.  Actually, it probably wasn   t until I went back to Northeastern, I really  started educating myself about not just Creek culture but tribal culture in  general, and then started getting more involved in culture, not only  Creek culture but Cherokee culture probably maybe as much as Creek  culture just because I   m here in Tahlequah. That   s really where I grew  up is more in the Christian church culture of Native life, I guess.  So did your Native studies classes   well, let   s talk, I guess, about what  you   re doing in art then, at that point, too, because you   re doing Native  studies and art. What kind of base skills are you acquiring in art?  I had no idea what to expect when I went back to school because, like I  10  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  said, I was at that point thirty or thirty-one years old. That was really a  little bit before   there weren   t nearly as many non-traditional students  then as there are now, so it was a little intimidating at first. I didn   t really  know what to expect from the art side or even the Indian studies side or  even college in general because I   d been out of school for so long. I kind  of went in with not a lot of expectations because I just didn   t know what  to expect.  But it turns out I really enjoyed both areas of studies. I enjoyed the art  because I was making art. I can   t say I rediscovered because I don   t  know that I ever knew. I knew I had some ability, but I never really  pursued it. I really discovered how much I enjoy doing art, especially in  a setting where that   s all I was expected to do. That was really enjoyable  to find out that,    Okay, I can paint and draw.     When it really clicked for me is when I had an intro to printmaking  class. That really caught my attention, and it put me on the path that I   m  still on now. There   s something about the press and the ink and the  whole process, the whole thing. We can talk about that more later, but  there was something about that that really captured my attention. Then,  coupled with the Indian studies, that   in a lot of ways the Indian studies  program made me think about my heritage, my tribal affiliation even, the  whole, what it means, the identity question, I guess. A lot of that fed into  the content that I was creating in my art. That   s something that still  shows up in my art all the time is that identity question, those  explorations of identity. Those things sort of dovetailed in nicely when I  went back to school, and that led me in a lot of ways that I really had no  idea that it would until I actually pursued it. It worked out real well. I   m  glad I decided to go back.  I   m glad you did, too. Who was a particularly memorable teacher you  had at that time?  At Northeastern?  Yes.  It   s interesting the way it worked because I ended up going back to, after  I got out of grad school, I went back to Northeastern and ended up being  colleagues of a lot of people that were my teachers at Northeastern. One  in particular, R. C. Coons, who taught drawing and painting and was  legendary for being this very curmudgeonly art professor. (Laughter) He  was a wonderful teacher. He was very specific in what he wanted you to  do, but he was tough. He was also very supportive in his own  curmudgeonly way, and I liked that about him.  11  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  A lot of students were freaked out or didn   t like him, but I think if you  really dug in, he was one of those professors that would really reward.  You were rewarded by working hard for him. He also taught  printmaking, and so he was instrumental in getting me interested in  printmaking and continuing that as I went on because I did some more  independent study printmaking projects after that. He was very helpful  and very inspirational to me. That kind of helped me to realize that this  is a really interesting way to express myself that I hadn   t ever thought of  before. R. C. Coons was probably one of the main guys that spurred me  on to really think about art as a serious career.  So after you graduated from NSU, did you go on immediately to grad  school, or what happened?  I did. I did. At that point, it would   ve been    92, and I would   ve been  thirty-five or something like that, mid-thirties somewhere. I thought and  talked it over with my wife. You know, a lot of people will want to sit  out for a year or two and then go back to grad school. I thought,    At my  advanced age, if I   m going to go to grad school, I probably need to go  ahead and go straight on to grad school.    I looked around a little bit, and  it turned out that I was able to get into the grad school over at University  of Arkansas and went straight from graduating Northeastern into the  MFA program at Fayetteville.  How was that different? What was different artistically for you at that  level?  It was very different. In fact, it took me a semester, at least, to get used  to the fact that all they expected was for me to do art but very focused  art. My first application, I didn   t even get in because I was not   I mean,  the artwork was okay, but I was all over the map. I didn   t realize until  later on that most grad schools (and U of A was no exception) are  looking for an artist that was pretty well on a path, focused on what  they   re working on.  I had no focus at that point, so I think what that certainly did, once I got  to grad school, was focus me very specifically on thinking about not  only the mediums that I was working in but the content, the direction,  the goals that I was even doing art for. When all you   re expected to do is  do art in your little cubicle, in your grad student cubicle, then yes, you  have to really get serious about it. I think that more than anything was  what was beneficial to me about grad school is it really focused me in on  what I was doing with my art.  So can you expand upon that a little more, then? What were the media  that you were focusing on and the subject matter?  12  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  I really wanted to continue doing the printmaking. It really grabbed me  at an undergrad level, and I really wanted to pursue that more because I  was interested. At that point, I was probably more interested from a  technical standpoint. I really liked the materials and the processes. Once  I got to grad school, my major was printmaking and then a secondary,  like a minor I guess you could call it, was in drawing. I ended up  actually doing more painting in grad school, and printmaking. In fact,  my MFA show was probably primarily painting with a pretty liberal  sprinkling of printmaking.  I guess it focused me more on not only what I wanted to do from a  media standpoint but probably more from content. It really got me  thinking about,    Okay, how can I use this art to say something, to  communicate?    I think, frankly, in undergrad it was more about getting  the projects done, hitting the deadline. I really wasn   t thinking so much  about what I was trying to say, which, as I see my students, still hasn   t  changed that much. (Laughter) If there   s a definite benefit to grad school  for anybody (and it was for me) is, like I said, that focusing on  especially content and on why you   re creating art. It does refine your  technical ability, sure, but I think it certainly more refines how you think  about your art and yourself doing art.  So did you start doing photo collage, for example, in graduate school,  using old photographs?  I really started the old photographs probably my last semester in  undergrad. I didn   t really have any agenda with these old photographs  other than I thought,    This would be cool to make a print out of.    I did  that in some of my printmaking projects as an undergrad in my senior  year, and then when I got to grad school, I really started thinking again  in that focus and what I   m trying to say.  I started thinking and started really concentrating on,    These old  photographs are more than just interesting things to copy.    They talk  about identity. They talk about history. They talk about family. They  talk about a lot of things that I   m really interested in. That really  captured my imagination on how I maybe could reuse these things in a  lot of different ways, whether it   s collage or as source material for prints  or paintings or whatever.  Then somewhere along the line, it wasn   t until I got to grad school when  I started integrating the text and the other materials like the Dawes Roll  names and Creek hymns and scripture and things like that. That   s really  when it started taking off for me of trying to include all these other bits  and pieces of information into these photographs.  13  Little Thunder  Martin  Yes, and let   s talk about that a little bit. As you say, the photographs are  both universal and have universal appeal, but they   re very personal. Yet  when you juxtapose them with those Dawes Rolls lists, what are some of  the associations that you   re evoking there?  I think probably, for me, when I started using those   and the reason I  even started using the Dawes Rolls names to start with was kind of an  accident in a lot of ways, which probably most things that artists do  come across from accidents. (Laughs) My mom pulled out   I don   t even  know why she even showed it to me. Maybe it was to show me where  our relatives were. From her BIA days she   d had a book, which I   ve got  over there, a book of all the Muscogee Creek and Freedmen, everybody  listed. It   s a Dawes Roll enrollment book.  As I was looking down those lists and lists of names and numbers and  tribal blood quantum and all that, I was looking at all those names and  numbers and thinking,    These were all individuals, but they   ve all been  codified into these names and numbers.    When I see these photographs,  they   re my family, mostly. I always try and use something that   s from  my family, and those are real people. You know, they   re real people.  They just happen to be Native American people because that   s my  family, and yet there   s these names and numbers that have been listed.  The other thing for me was it also was a connection because even today,  obviously, to get any kind of free health care you have to be able to find  some relative or some ancestor on those rolls. It   s still got a political  play today. So to combine what was real for me with what was real to  the government or whoever, it was an identity thing. It   s really what got  me interested in the fact that, okay, here   s one kind of identity. Here   s  another kind of identity. They   re both real in their way, but if I combine  those     I don   t know. It just seemed to be a natural mix of ironic, maybe, and  politically   well, I guess maybe I was trying to make political  statements, but I think it was about identity. It was about the struggle for  me, too, about,    Okay, here   s what was real for me. Here   s what the  government says or whoever says. I   ve got to have a card that says I   m  connected to somebody on these lists.     Then it was a natural progression from there to include other bits and  pieces of texts and words and scripture and things like that. Actually  before I even got to the Dawes names, I was using quotations. I need to  go back to some of that. I found some really cool quotes from Special  Collections at Northeastern   s library. Do you know Delores Sumner  over there?  14  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Yes.  They had those  Indian -Pioneer Papers and I had gone through them. It  was some of the Indian studies courses I had, and I was doing research  through that. I found some wonderful old quotes from some of the early  Native settlers, really. They were talking about all kinds of things, and  so those were really the initial text that I used, were some of those  quotes from some of those Pioneer Papers. Then it progressed from  there to the Dawes. The Dawes thing was when I really got more into the  identity question.  After you received your MFA, you were Artist-in-Residence at Gilcrease  museum for a year. How did that come about?  It came about, well, providentially. The last year of my grad school at  University of Arkansas, I had applied for this new fellowship. It was  brand new. I think it had been only the second year it started through the  College Art Association and it was called the Professional Development  Fellowship.  The idea was you got a grant or an award for your last year of grad  school, and then they paid, like, half your salary to transition to a job or  some kind of position somewhere. I applied. I had no expectation, but I  was selected to get a College Art Association Professional Development  Fellowship. That helped me to finish up and get my MFA thesis  exhibition all put together.  That   s how it led to the Gilcrease position because I had talked to a  couple of places. I   d talked to the University of Massachusetts in  Dartmouth, not the Ivy League Dartmouth. There   s another  University  of Massachusetts  in New Bedford, Massachusetts. I talked to the art  program there, and they were interested in bringing me out. I flew out  there for an interview. Their expectations were not what my expectations  were, so that didn   t match up.  In the meantime, a good friend of mine, Kevin Smith, who was Curator  of Education at that time at Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, had been  working. He knew I   d got the fellowship. He knew that they could bring  me in pretty cheap because the fellowship was going to pay up to a  certain amount of my salary. He convinced the curator and the powers-that-  be over there to bring me in under this position called Artist-in-  Residence, which is great. It was a great pitch. I followed in the  footsteps of Woody Crumbo. Who else was there? Willard Stone.  It was great. What it really meant is I was able to work there a year  15  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  under that fellowship funding, and I taught. How he pitched this and  how he was able to sell this is they were just beginning to offer  educational programming for students, like afterschool programs for  adults, weekend classes. This was a new thing then. This would   ve been  in    95.  He brought me in to help organize and teach the classes. Also, my role,  probably more my main role, was they were also looking for somebody  that could do some graphic design, to design some of their signage for  the museum and, like, the quarterly members newsletters and things like  that and other PR materials. Of course, the interesting thing about that  was I had no experience as a graphic designer, zero, (Laughter) so it was  interesting that I was really, literally, learning by the seat of my pants on  that deal.  The cool thing about it was at the end of that first year the funding  ended, and they were able to keep me on. At that point, I think my title  was not Artist-in-Residence anymore. It became Graphic Designer or  Graphic Design Coordinator or something like that, so I became more  the graphic designer for the museum and then worked there for five  years.  It was a great experience. I loved working at Gilcrease and learning  about museum culture and everything. The nice thing about that job is I  was teaching classes, I was doing graphic design, I was doing a lot of  different things, a real variety of things all related to art. It was a neat  experience.  And in that first year, were you also expected to produce outside of that  graphic design area?  My own work, you mean?  Yes.  No, not really. It wasn   t the same kind of Artist-in-Residence that, say,  Willard Stone was expected to do or Woody Crumbo, although a lot of  their role had to do with advising, too, advising Mr. Gilcrease on  purchases and stuff. But, no, it wasn   t really expected, although I did do  a lot of work.  That first year one of the really big things I got to be involved with was  a show that Kevin put together called the Masters   shoot, I can   t  remember the official title. It was something like Masters Exhibition. He  picked five different artists to be featured and then a collection of other  contemporary artists, and so I got to be one of the featured artists. It was  16  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  me and   who else was featured? Edgar Heap of Birds and Virginia  Stroud, I think. Anyway, it was a really nice show, a really well-done  show. It gave me a lot of confidence in myself. It was also good for my  career at that point, too.  And then you also started Berean  Intermedia  Studio.  Yes, Berean was my freelance company, I guess you   d call it. It was just  me. At some point between that first year at Gilcrease of being Artist-in-  Residence and then the next four years of being a graphic designer, I  somehow turned into a graphic designer and stopped making very much  art at that time. Didn   t do a whole lot of art. I did the one big show at  Gilcrease and kept making a little art, but the more graphic design I kept  doing, the farther away I got from studio art, to the point of where the  next part of my life was getting a teaching position at Northeastern. The  reason I got the teaching position is because I had the graphic design  experience at Gilcrease, so I was brought in as a full-time graphic design  professor.  At that point, I wouldn   t say I totally abandoned fine art, but I was doing  mostly graphic design. That   s where Berean Intermedia came in. I was  doing a lot of freelance work, graphic design work, web design work,  and that was my freelance company that I still use whenever I do any  kind of freelance design work.  You   ve had a couple of exhibitions within the Muscogee Creek  community: one at Checotah, I guess their community center, and then  one at Creek Nation Elderly Senior Nutrition Center. Let   s talk about  the Checotah show first, which was called Through Our Ancestors     Eyes. Did they have an opening for it?  Yes, that was an interesting show. This was more recent than the Elderly  Nutrition. This was probably in 2008, I think. It was another providential  thing. Actually, it was a cousin of mine who was the director of the     what is that official title? The Checotah Creek Indian Community  Center. They provide help. They have a meeting building there, down in  Checotah, and they also provide help to the Creek community in  Checotah.  Somebody, one of the officers of the community center, had just seen a  photograph. I don   t know if it was in the Creek Nation paper or  somewhere. It was a photograph of a pastel diptych that I had done from  a family photograph. It had my granny in it, and it had several other  matriarchs of the Creek community. It caught her eye because she knew  all those ladies that were in the photograph, and she was actually related  to at least one of them. That caught her eye, and she didn   t know at the  17  Little Thunder  Martin  time that the director was my cousin. (Laughs) She showed him that, and  she thought that was really neat because there was a direct connection to  the Creek community there in Checotah. Of course, he says,    Oh, it  turns out, he   s my first cousin.    So that   s how that came about.  They were really interested in seeing that image. What was fun for me is  I really didn   t want it to be   because the community center is not an art  gallery. Really, it   s just a meeting place for folks to hang out. I didn   t  have any expectation. I didn   t want to bring in a bunch of paintings and  fine-arty work that people didn   t understand, necessarily. I really  thought it would work neat because it was a tie into their community if I  made it a collaboration between me and the community.  What I proposed was for them to send out a request to all the community  members to bring in their old photographs and I would curate those. We  did. We got a lot of folks bringing in old photographs. I selected, I don   t  know, thirty or forty photographs, and we Photoshopped them a little bit  so they   d be all consistent looking, and then ended up matting and  framing those choices. The ones we didn   t pick we ended up printing  them all into, like, a photo album so people could look through all of  them at the opening of the show, through the whole show, really. Then I  put a scattering of my own work mixed in with their photo that they  brought in.  It was a neat way to collaborate with the community. I liked it because I  wanted to make what I was doing more connectable and more real to  people that probably were never going to go to an art museum, never  going to go to an art gallery. I wanted to make what I was doing  relatable to their lives and their experiences, and it worked out really  great. I was really happy with the response, the response of putting the  show together and the response of when it got up on the walls. I   d been  using a lot of these photographs for several years but didn   t really know  some of the people in them. It really helped me identify a bunch of  people that were in these photographs because a lot of these people were  related to them. It was really a fun project.  That   s neat. How about the Nutrition Center exhibition? What was that?  Actually, that was a continuation of my MFA thesis show. After the  thesis exhibition at the gallery there in Fayetteville, I had two other  showings of basically that same show. It was a re-creation of a lot of  images from Dwight Mission. All these were photographs that my  granny had. She was there maybe two or three years from 1917 to, like,  1919 or so. We didn   t even discover these photographs until after she  had passed away, in all her stash of photos that she had. It was amazing  how many photos she did have. I was really blown away.  18  Little Thunder  Martin  Anyway, that whole MFA thesis show was all related to Dwight  Mission. I showed basically the same show. I showed it at Holland Hall  School in Tulsa. They have that big gallery. Is it called Walker, I  believe?  Holliman Gallery  I can   t remember. Anyway, it   s a really nice  gallery. I showed that show at Holland Hall in Tulsa.  Then a lady from the Creek Nation came up and saw the show and was  very interested in it and proposed that I show it in Okmulgee  somewhere. The only place that was really big enough to do it was the  Elderly Nutrition Center, a big giant room. It was neat, too. It was my  own work, but I did put a book out trying to say,    If you know anybody  in these images, let me know,    and trying to get some feedback from the  community. It was fun.  We had a nice little reception, served sofke. A lot of the older folks came  out and looked around and really enjoyed. I did find a couple more  names that I didn   t know before.    Oh, I recognize so and so.    That was a  fun one, too. Both those shows, to me, were unique because they were  out of the ordinary venue. You   re taking it out of the accepted venues of  galleries and museums and putting it into a place where you don   t  necessarily expect to see art. I like that. I like getting out of those  expected scenarios.  That   s real important. How did your position at John Brown come  about, John Brown University?  Well, it came about from my wanting to get out of the graphic design  mode, I guess because, like I mentioned, I had gotten a position at  Northeastern. I left Gilcrease to go to Northeastern specifically to teach  graphic design. That was in 2000. I guess I had been there for three or  four years, yes, four years, working with all my colleagues that were my  teachers ten years earlier when I was an undergrad, which was  interesting.  They all decided to retire basically within the two years, three years that  I got there. They all retired. I was left in my third or fourth year being  the senior person, and somehow I let myself get talked into being the  chair of the department. (Laughter) So now I   m finding myself doing  graphic design, teaching graphic design, which I liked. I enjoyed it. I  was also doing administrative stuff, which I didn   t really enjoy all that  much.  You know, six years in, you can go up for tenure, so I did the tenure  thing. I got tenure, got a promotion to associate professor. So, you know,  I was flowing along, eight years in now at Northeastern. I   m basically  19  Little Thunder  Martin  teaching all graphic design, having all these administrative duties. I   m  not doing any art, zero art. I mean, I would finish a piece every now and  then to maybe enter at the Trail of Tears show, something like that, but  I   m talking one or two pieces of art a year, maybe. I really wouldn   t  even consider myself an artist at that point. I   m just doing graphic  design. I was teaching printmaking, which I really enjoyed, but I really  wasn   t making any art.  I was thinking about that, and I happened to notice that an opening came  up at this little school in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. I knew the name of  it, but I didn   t really know anything about it. They were looking for a  fine art faculty, studio art faculty. Also, the fact that they were a  Christian university   I   d been for several years thinking that as a  Christian and as somebody that would like to be in an environment to  teach art or design from a Christian perspective, it might be interesting.  So when this came up it was like,    Hmm, okay. It   s a Christian  university. They want to do more studio art.    I had been wanting to get  more back into the studio art world. On a whim almost, I applied.  Because I already had tenure and everything at Northeastern, I had no  reason to leave. I was doing fine there, but I really wasn   t doing what I  felt like I really wanted to do.  Anyway, I applied, and lo and behold, they called me in for an  interview. I went over there and spent all day doing the interviews.  Turns out it was a wonderful school. They   re very Christ-centered in  their educational beliefs, and their art program is stupendous. I didn   t  know this. I didn   t have any idea. I figured,    A little small Christian  school, they   re not going to have much of an art program, but I   ll go see  what it looks like.     I got over there, I mean, they   ve got their own dedicated building space.  They really are interested in bringing in somebody that can teach  printmaking. Okay, that made my ears perk up, right there. It was like,     Oh, you want a printmaker. Hmm.    (Laughter) It was very close to  home, and I really didn   t want to move halfway across the United States  because we had so many roots here. When I got offered the job, I really  almost wasn   t expecting it. I   d almost applied out of curiosity more than  anything because why would I want to give up tenure and all this stuff?  Somehow, I felt like God was saying,    This is where I want you,    and so  I accepted the job. That was in 2008. I guess I   m finishing up my fourth  year over there now.  And since that move, you   ve had more time to produce, as well.  Yes, there were several things that fell into place to be getting more back  20  into the fine art world. The JBU move was one. At that point, I was  committed. If I   m going to teach fine art, I better be doing fine art, so  that was a commitment that I had to start being an artist again.  Another major thing that happened at almost the exact same time was a  collector named Bill Wiggins, if you know Bill, Bill hunted me down.  He had seen my painting that was in Gilcrease for all those years, and he  had heard my name around, but that was a whole stretch where I really  wasn   t making any art at all. He   d seen my name, and he was like,    I  don   t know where to find this Bobby Martin guy. I keep seeing his stuff  and hearing his name, but I never see anything about him or see him  anywhere.     I can   t remember who he found me through, but he found me, tracked  me down. I didn   t think I was that hard to find, but apparently I was.  (Laughter) He came out to my house. I had no studio at the time or  anything. I had stuff scattered around in closets or whatever. He came  out to the house and looked at my work and was very encouraging,  bought a couple of pieces. Again, that was almost exactly the same time  I was starting at JBU. He was very encouraging and really gave me the  inspiration or motivation to really want to start being serious about doing  art again.  Then maybe a third thing that probably fell into place was I met Tony  Tiger, who you know, who is head of the art program at Bacone   College , also an amazing artist. We got to talking and got to know each  other. We found out how much we had in common, and we decided,     Why don   t we do a collaborative show?    and we did. We did a  collaborative show that we opened. It showed at JBU about three and a  half years ago, and then it also showed at Bacone. That experience of  collaborating and putting together a focused show, all those three things  sort of all came together in this   I don   t know what the word would be  when things come together. (Laughs) This crossroads of inspiration that  made me consider,    Wow, maybe I should really get serious about art  again.     Then the final thing that happened that made me realize,    Okay, I   ve  really made the commitment now,    is when we found this property  where we   re sitting. I had the chance at that time to actually have a  studio. Until I moved in here and moved my stuff in and bought the  etching press and started doing art very seriously, I didn   t realize how  much having a studio makes you feel like a real artist.  It   s not the same when you   re doing it in a spare bedroom or doing it on  your kitchen table. There   s something about having a studio space  dedicated to your art that makes you feel that you   re truly an artist and  21  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  that you   re serious about your art. I guess maybe part of it   s the  investment, yes, physical and material, but it   s also an investment of  your time and effort. All those things converged to make me realize that,     Okay, this is what I   m supposed to be doing. I   m supposed to be really  getting back into doing art again.     Let   s talk a little bit about the piece of work that you have currently at  the Hardesty  Arts  Center in downtown Tulsa, part of  Concept/OK:  Art in Oklahoma  show?  Yes, that was a show put together by Oklahoma Visual Arts Coalition,  OVAC, in conjunction with the opening of the AH HA building  Arts  and Humanities Council of Tulsa Hardesty Arts Center . I don   t know  how they get AH HA out of that, but anyway, this new arts center, which  is a spectacular building. The show was to help launch the building  opening. I was selected to have a piece in that show. Actually, the  original piece they selected, that they originally wanted, I wish had got  in, but I had already sold it to Sam Noble Museum in Norman. It was in  the show that I had at the Capitol building.  It was about a year ago, exactly a year ago, 2011. It was a large painting.  Actually, it was more of a mixed media and caustic painted collage  together and then with oil paint over the top, called Indian on an Indian.  It was my mom   s sister, my aunt, my oldest aunt on my mom   s side,  astride this old Indian motorcycle. It was a cool photograph, and I made  a large painting out of it. That   s the one they chose first, but by the time  they let me know that that   s the choice, I   d already sold it to the  museum.  My second choice, which is the one that   s in the show, is called  Homecoming Royalty, and it   s a photograph that my mom had from her  days at Haskell  Indian Nations University  in Lawrence, Kansas. It   s a  couple in full regalia, but they   re the Homecoming king and queen. It  was some of my typical combining names and numbers in the  background and then with an image over the top of that. The image, it  was a lot of oil glazes that I wanted to look almost like a screen print but  a little more depth to it. It was a fun painting to do. Content-wise it   s  very similar, but technique-wise it   s quite a bit different in a lot of ways  from what I do. It was a fun piece to do. I   m glad I got the opportunity to  show there.  Let   s talk a little bit about your techniques and process, maybe starting  with this encaustic effect you   ve been using, which really has a  wonderful look to it. Can you explain what it adds to your work that you  like and how you started using it?  22  Martin  I think I started using it because I was looking for ways   well, going  back when I first started incorporating text in collage elements, I looked  for many, many ways to get text onto canvas or paper or whatever it  might be and never was really that satisfied with the way it worked.  When I started doing my graphic design and getting into programs like  Photoshop which have layers, (you have layers that you can manipulate  digitally) suddenly it was like,    Ooh  That   s what I want to do. I want to  layer everything and move it around and change the opacity and all  that.     I did that, and that   s a lot of my art output in that decade where I was  doing more graphic design. My fine art output was digital because I  really enjoyed that ability to move layers around, digital layers. I have to  admit I was never, ever happy with the output. Inkjet prints, giclee  prints, whatever you want to call them, they   re still just ink on paper  printed by a machine. I was never real happy with the results even  though I really love moving layers. It was so nice to be able to do that,  and it looked pretty good on the screen, but the final output felt lifeless. I  was never happy with that.  I guess it   s been pretty recently within the last couple of years where I  sort of stumbled onto this process of encaustic, which is making a  resurgence now. For a lot of years the only person that was doing  encaustic was Jasper Johns and a few other assorted artists that were  working with this weird beeswax-based material. You find lots of books  about it now. It   s making a comeback, I guess. Not a comeback. It   s  becoming more popular.  When I started looking into it and then started playing around with it  myself, that   s when the light bulb started going off. It was like,    Wow, I  can actually physically layer things, embed them in layers of wax that  are transparent that I can see through physically to lower layers, and then  build on top of that.    Suddenly, instead of this digital world, I can create  real, physical layers and get even a totally different look. In some ways  it   s the same, but I love that depth it   s created. Also, the wax itself,  somehow it creates, to me anyway, a sense of age in ways that canvas  doesn   t.  I   ve been really interested lately in that whole idea of embedding and  layering, and then painting on top of all that. Also, you were talking  about process or technique. One of the things that   s really interesting to  me   and we can look at that later with that painting over there.  Something that I   m really interested in trying to pursue is I can draw into  the wax and then fill those lines with, like, oil stick and then clean off  the wax surface, and it leaves the incised lines filled with ink or with oil  stick paint.  23  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  It looks very much like a print, like a dry point print or an etching, and  then I paint over that. It   s got the look of printmaking, which I love; it   s  got the layering of the computer, which I love; and it   s got the painting  on the surface, which I love. It combines everything I   ve been interested  in all in one neat package. That   s what   s really been interesting to me  lately is pursuing that idea. It   s the first medium I   ve found that I can do  all those things to an extent that I feel like it   s really worth exploring  more.  Right, yes, it   s really neat. So when you   re talking about the kinds of  printing that you like to do, you   re mainly talking about this sort of  etching?  Yes. The three main techniques of printmaking are lithography, which is  usually on stone or metal plates, relief printing, which is linoleum cuts  or wood cuts where the ink goes on the surface, and then you put the  paper down and put pressure on it. The third kind, which I   m mostly  interested in, is intaglio, which involves creating lines or some kind of  marks into a surface, and then the ink is held in that surface. Then you  polish off the surface, and then the ink that   s below the surface gets  printed. That   s etching, dry point, engraving. All that involves an  etching press. I didn   t do any kind of printmaking, especially etching,  for that whole decade after I graduated from grad school because I didn   t  have access to an etching press, so I just didn   t do that. That   s what I   ve  been interested in. I   ve really become re-interested in it now that I   ve got  my own etching press, which is a great blessing.  Right, we can take a quick look at that. How important is preliminary  sketching to your work?  Now, don   t tell my students, but not that important. (Laughter) Because  I do work a lot from photographs, I don   t necessarily sketch those photos  out. I find different ways to transfer them. Like these large paintings, I  will use a projector and project the photographs. I do draw them, but I  don   t necessarily draw a bunch of preliminary drawings out. I usually try  and work the idea out on a sketchbook, but really more frequently I use  the computer. I use Photoshop as my preliminary sketchpad where I will  use that program to arrange where the photograph is going to go in  relation to the text or the other elements that are in it. That becomes,  really, my preliminary sketch is what   s on the computer. Often, whether  it   s a print or whether it   s a painting, whatever it might be, often my  preliminary work is done in the computer, and then that   s my basis for  where I go from there.  How about, occasionally, have you used some deliberate distortion in  24  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  your drawing? I   m thinking about like Sonny and Son II, a work that I  saw on your website.  You mean distortion of the proportion or figures?  Yes.  Sometimes but usually, though, I try and be fairly faithful to the original  photo. I mean, I will change a lot of things in the composition of the  photo probably. I rarely use the photo as-is. Yes, I have used some  deliberate distortions occasionally, but usually if it   s some distortion, it   s  probably my lack of artistic ability to get it right. (Laughs) Typically,  though, if I am using a photograph, I try and stay at least fairly faithful  to the subject, especially the literal subject person that   s in the  photograph, but then I   ll change lots of other things about it.  Do you feel like with some of your projects you   re getting more involved  with three-dimensional media? That   s separate and apart from  encaustic, but I   m thinking about the project that we   re going to talk  about here at the end.  Well, I have been getting more interested in installation-type work. I just  did a piece for a show that Heather Ahtone and Tony Tiger and America  Meredith created, that H2OK show that showed in Norman, Mainsite   Contemporary Art  Gallery, and also showed at Bacone. I put together a  little installation, an actual working water fountain thing. It involved  some steel-cut names, the Dawes names, and some old photographs, my  usual shtick, but it was put together in a way where the water ran  through the steel and trickled down the names. Then it was backlit where  the photographs were backlit and glowing in the midst of all that steel  and water.  It was interesting to me because I   d never really tried anything like that  before. I mean, when I   ve put shows together, usually there   s some  element of installation a little bit involved in putting it together. Like my  thesis show, really, my idea was to put even a large six-by-ten-foot  painting, instead of stretching it on a stretcher on canvas, I put the  canvas on the wall and put these wooden corners that were cut in  triangles to look like old photo corners. I   ve always had this inclination  to do installation-type things, but recently I   ve been going more full-blown,  purely installation construction-type things. That water feature  was one of the things I worked on.  The thing you were mentioning, collaborating with Tony Tiger on, is  another that   s a major installation that we   re working on. The fact the  encaustics become, themselves, a little more three-dimensional in the  25  Little Thunder  Martin  fact that you   re dealing with these multiple layers of wax, (the wax melts  and runs all over the place) you don   t really have control. I like the  drippiness of it, and I like the tactile quality of that material. I don   t see  myself becoming a sculptor or anything like that, but I do really enjoy  the three-dimensional quality of the stuff that I   ve been working with.  What is your creative process from the time you get an idea?  Well, it varies, I suppose. Usually, at least for the past, I don   t know how  many years, fifteen or more years, I   ve really been using these old  family photographs. A lot of it comes directly from the photographs,  looking through those photographs, and I   ve been blessed that my  mom   s side of the family were photo bugs. (Laughter) They all took a  lot of pictures every time we   d get together at family events. We have a  Christmas get-together every year, and it seems like they always show  up with more photographs that they   ve found somewhere. They know  that I do this, so they all bring their photos in.  It often starts with the photo. I   ve used a lot of the same photos multiple  times just because I love the photo, but I   ll do it in different ways with  different media or reuse it in some way. I   ve reused a lot of the similar  images a lot, which I like that. I like to be able to continue to use these.  It   s the consistent thing that I   ve done over the years is use a core  collection of photos that I love and rework them in different ways.  It mostly usually starts with the photograph, and the next thing, maybe  decide, okay, what medium I want to use because I get really bored if I  just work in one medium all the time. I   ll skip around from printmaking  to painting to encaustic. The process is, a lot of times, I   ll take which  photograph I want to use. I will then play around with it. Again, that   s  my preliminary sketches is working with it in the computer. I   ve got a  collection of different kinds of materials, like the Dawes names, and I   ve  got a little-bitty Creek hymn book. It   s in Muscogee Creek language that  belonged to my granny. It   s got a lot of her handwriting and notes in it  and things. I   ve used that a lot. I   ll scan some of those pages and  incorporate those elements into it. A lot of it, the preliminary sketching  and the idea generating, comes in the computer.  From there, it depends on what technique or what medium I   m going to  use. Sometimes it doesn   t come out of the computer. Sometimes I use  the computer mockup and work from that. Other times it   ll get printed  out, say, for example, a photo etching. The output itself will come out as  a transparency, and then that gets exposed to the plate. So sometimes it   s  the actual physical, digital file that becomes the basis for it. Other times,  like encaustics a lot of times are cut-and-paste in layers of wax. I guess  the creative process, at least the majority of the time for me, starts with  26  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  the photograph.  What about your creative routine? I mean, you   re teaching during the  day, obviously, but when you   re in the studio, what   s your routine?  In the studio itself, similar. I get bored easily by working on one thing  for very long. It   s been an amazing blessing to have a studio space  because I can keep things set up and I can bounce back and forth. I can  work a little bit on this one, and then either while I   m letting a layer dry  or a glaze dry, I can go work on something else.  Also, it   s been nice to have a studio like this because what I like to do as  a printmaker especially is collaborate. A lot of times it depends on  bouncing stuff off other people, having people out here. Often I   ve had  several opportunities to have other artists out and do, like, print parties  or little monotype sessions where we all get together and kick around  some ideas and put some art out there, not necessarily any finished  exhibit-ready work. Just throw some ideas around. To me, that   s a lot of  fun, swapping ideas and swapping techniques and seeing how other  people work.  You   ve done that with the Southeastern  Indian  Artists Association?  Yes, I   ve done that several times, and our meetings will come out here.  In fact, the last meeting we had in November, I think, we had a group  out. It was really neat. We had a group of eight or nine folks, some  artists, some not artists. Even the non-artists are willing to sit down and  try and make a monotype. It   s a lot of fun. I like that interaction of artists  creating.  As you look back over your career so far, what do you consider a kind of  fork-in-the-road moment?  I don   t know if it was a single moment that I could define, but that  conjunction I was talking about of taking the job at JBU as a studio art  faculty, and also the Bill Wiggins push, finding me and then saying,     You need to get off your rear and start making some art.    (Laughter)  And then putting together that show with Tony Tiger. It didn   t happen  all in one moment, but it was all close enough together that it felt like  that was the     Then I guess the final big push was getting the studio. That made it  really real at that point, that,    Okay, wow, I   ve somehow become an  artist now.    (Laughter) Not just the building, but those things all  combined, especially the moment that I actually had a studio to work in  really confirmed that,    Okay, I guess I   m on that path now to being very  27  Little Thunder  Martin  serious about it.    I mean, I was serious enough before where I was  getting into shows and doing things like that, but I really didn   t feel like  I was giving it everything I had.  The time spent teaching is good. Probably most artists would love to be  able to do nothing but their art, (I would surely crave that at some point)  but the freedom that I have in the schedule of teaching is awfully nice.  To be able to work on my own things in the summer times and even  through the year, I   ve got enough time that I can devote.  I know myself well enough, and that   s probably why I like being in  academia, is I need the structure of deadlines, the structure of a time, a  concentrated time focus. If I don   t have any show or any kind of  deadline I   m working for, I   ll tend to get very lazy and not do anything.  I need to either give myself or put upon myself some kind of deadline or  structure or something to shoot for. I   m finding that having a studio is  great, but I still need to have something that I   m working toward,  otherwise I   ll just float around. (Laughter)  I can think of a fairly recent   and a lot of them tie to exhibitions. Going  back, my thesis exhibition was, I think, a highlight for me. It was the  first time I could step back and look at a whole gallery   s worth of work  and say,    Wow, I did this.    That was a neat experience. Then I went  through the fallow time of doing no art for many years after that. Two  highlights that I can really think of in the last few years was the  collaborative show that I did with Tony Tiger that I mentioned. Again,  that was a real impetus to get me getting serious about my art again. Our  work, our style, and the look of our work somehow seems to  complement each other in a good way. I really enjoyed that  collaboration I   ve had with him.  Then probably from a personal standpoint, the show that I had at the  Capitol Building in Oklahoma City last January, for me, was probably     it was the first time I really got to use this studio in a really very focused,  deadline-driven way, that I had a bunch of pieces I had to finish for a  specific show, and it was a big show. It was a show that was going to be  featured in the Capitol Building, so it was a fairly large venue to shoot  for. As far as a career high point, I would say that would be way up  there.  How many pieces did you have in the Capitol show?  I think I ended up having twenty or twenty-two. I can   t remember, but  they were everything from six-by-eight-foot paintings down to little  small prints. I think it was, I want to say, twenty-two, twenty-three  pieces.  28  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  And all done for the Back In The Day show?  Probably 80 percent of them were. There were a few that had been done,  that I had finished previously, but they all still fit into the idea that I was  going for. But yes, the vast majority of it was all finished specifically for  that show.  Well, looking back, what   s been one of the low points of your career?  Low points. Well, that   s a good question. I don   t know. When I think of  it as a career, my career has been   I felt like it was interesting. I was  really on a roll out of grad school. I was getting some nice shows, and I  was doing a lot of work. Then right after grad school my output mostly  tanked mainly because, in some ways, I think about it, it   s because I  didn   t have the discipline of deadlines and classes to finish. I had my  job. I was working at Gilcrease, and I didn   t really spend any time on  my own. When I think of low points, I think of discouragements, but I  don   t know that I   ve had necessarily   the low points in my career were  probably self-imposed low points because of abandoning what maybe I  could   ve been doing or should   ve been doing. Bill Wiggins often points  that out.    You just quit for a big section there.    (Laughter)  I feel like, especially, the last year to two years has been reestablishing  what I abandoned twelve or thirteen years earlier. I guess you could look  at that abandonment as a low point, rather than trying to keep this. You  know, you think your career trajectory is supposed to keep going up.  Mine was going up, and then it just quit, and now I   m feeling like I   m  picking it back up. I guess if I could think of a low point, it   d be that I  did sort of walk away from it for quite a while.  Is there anything you   d like to add or anything we   ve forgotten to talk  about before we take a look at your work?  Well, I   ve enjoyed talking about it because a lot of this, I haven   t really  thought through it until you asked the question. It was like,    Oh, okay.     Even thinking about my career as a career, sometimes artists don   t often  do that. Sometimes it   s going from one deadline, one show to the next,  so it   s good to think about it as a career. I think if anybody   s looking at  these tapes for any career advice, it   d be,    Look at your art output as a  career. Try and make decisions that you think are true to yourself but  also are going to help establish yourself as an artist, as a person even, as  a communicator, not worry so much about trying to finish one piece to  get to the next show.    I think a lot of times as artists we do that.  I have been blessed to be able to be in positions where I don   t have to  29  Little Thunder  Martin  rely on my art to make a living, and so I   ve been able to explore a lot of  things that I probably wouldn   t have done if I was only relying on art to  make a living. I   ve just been happy to be able to pass some of that  knowledge on to other people. I   ve really enjoyed the educational aspect  of my career, of the teaching part of it. I don   t necessarily see myself  teaching way into retirement age.  I mean, I   ve really enjoyed it. I   d love to continue doing it for as long as  it   s interesting. I think I   ve drawn a lot of energy from students, too.  Every semester you go back. You   ve got new classes and new students,  and a lot of them have some interesting ideas. Some of them aren   t  practical sometimes, but the energy that they have has helped maintain  interest for me. I really like that part of my career.  Do you want to tell us about the grave house project?  Yes, this is a work in progress, a collaboration between Tony Tiger and  myself. The inspiration for this was, one of the traditions among Creek  and even some Choctaw and Chickasaw, but I think it   s mostly Creek  Christians are to build   it   s not universal. You see them a lot down  around Henryetta, Oklahoma, and Dustin and those areas. As part of the  burial process, they will bury a person, and then they will build a little  structure over the grave. They call it the grave house. It   s actually a little  house that   s got a peaked roof and everything. It usually has shingles  and siding. The idea is that   s a repository for the spirit until the spirit  goes to heaven. They don   t maintain the grave house. They build it, and  it   s designed to decay, dust to dust kind of an idea.  Our idea on this was we wanted to take the concept of a grave house but  make an installation out of it that was more of a metaphor. It   s not like a  literal grave house that talks about, necessarily, burial, but it does talk  about burial. It talks about death of the body versus the body is   and we  have a scripture from Second Thessalonians. It talks about our earthly  house, our body versus our heavenly home. The idea was to incorporate  a lot of the stuff that we   ve done for a long time in both our artwork,  which is old family materials like photographs and text, the idea of the  Christian belief of death, burial, and resurrection, and take all those  ideas and then combine them into this metaphorical grave house which  an actual grave house.  I don   t know how much you can see on the side, here. It   s not going to  roll around. The idea is to take the lower section, which is what we   ve  got so far, the lower part of the grave house   it will have a peaked roof  on it. We   ve incorporated some of the Dawes names. I   ve got a lot of my  family names on one side. Tony   s names are on the other side. This  lower section will represent the earthly, the body, physical body, that  30  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  goes into the ground and decays. We   ll have some backlighting, some  lighting inside here. We   re going to put some Plexiglas behind here and  paint it white or off-white or sepia tone to kind of diffuse it.  What we   re hoping for in a museum or a gallery situation, that the light  will have this glow from the letters. Then what we   ll have on the peaked  roof, rather than having shingles, we   re going to have like old family  photographs. Each shingle will be a photo. The shingles will be  transparent in some way, and we   ll have it lit from the inside where the  idea would be the light shining through the imagery, through the old  photos, through our family, shining up into this idea of resurrection, the  light coming up and out. The bottom will be muted and old, and the top  hopefully will be more lit and resurrection-like. That   s the plan.  We   re still debating on whether to maybe build   obviously, they   re in  cemeteries, but they   re usually built on a little a mound. We might even  try and construct some kind of little mound as part of the installation.  We   re still working on some of the details, like especially the roof part  of it, the kind of materials we   re going to use to get that lighting, bright  enough light. Some of the technical stuff we   re still working on.  But the idea, we really like the idea, and we really wanted to pursue the  idea. We don   t really have necessarily even a venue or anything for it.  We just liked the idea, and we wanted to do it. We   ve collaborated a lot  on 2D stuff, but we never really collaborated on any kind of installation.  It was an excuse, really, to be able to build something. (Laughter)  Now, the old lumber came from a   it was an old garden shed that was  on the property, and I took it down and saved the lumber on that to use  for the siding because we wanted to give it, obviously, that old look. We  had a local guy plasma cut into steel the names. It   s been a fun project.  We   re just going along. We   ll see what happens once we get it done.  It   s going to be great. I   m sure a venue will find you.  Well, that   s what we   re hoping.  Do you want to tell us a little bit about this piece?  Well, I wanted to show this piece because, from a printmaker   s  standpoint, it   s something I   ve been working on quite a bit lately. It   s  called solar plate etching. The solar plate is the name for the actual plate  that   s involved in the printing of this. The reason I got interested in it is  because, again, I can manipulate layers in a program like Photoshop on  the computer and then I can output that actual Photoshop file onto a  transparency and then expose that onto the plate.  31  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  To me, that   s an interesting way of being able to create visually, create  things in the way I   m used to creating, but then output it in a way that I  can physically print it like I   m used to doing. To me, it   s a great  combination of the new school and the old school because I can use the  computer to create the image, but then I can ink it and print it just like a  regular etching. There   s some text comes in. It   s Proverbs 31, I believe.  This is a picture of my Aunt Inez. This is my mom   s oldest sister.  There   s so many photos that I have where they   re posing in front of their  cars. I love the people, but I also love those old vehicles that are in the  pictures, too. To me, that   s a lot of the charm of it, too, is those old  photos with people posing in front of their cars or trucks or whatever it  might be. The process involves   creating any kind of imagery that you  can get on a transparency that blocks light will work.  You can draw with a Sharpie. You can paint on it with India ink.  Anything that   ll block light will create an image that   s printable. In this  case, again, I use a Photoshop digital file, output it to a piece of  transparency, and then expose it to the plate. Once you process that  plate, you can ink it and wipe it and print it just like any other etching.  This idea of solar plate printing or photo etching has been one I   ve been  experimenting with quite a bit lately.  That   s neat. That   s a really neat quality.  I didn   t think about it, but I   ve hand-tinted those there, too. (Gestures)  Okay. How about this particular etching?  This is actually a screen print.  Oh, a screen print. I   m sorry.  Yes, it   s a screen print, which is new for me. One of the reasons I was  interested in doing this is I really don   t have a lot of experience in screen  printing until I was asked to teach a screen printing class. Suddenly, it   s  like,    Oh, I better learn how to screen print.    I   ve been to a couple of  workshops, and I   ve actually taught the class a couple of times. Getting  ready to teach it again this spring. I wanted to see how I could adapt  screen printing to my usual content, my usual subject matter. This was a  three-color screen print. I   ve got the light tan, more of the darker brown,  and then the black.  What I was interested in doing is trying to figure out when I   m taking  these old family photos, trying to figure out how to decide where the  32  Little Thunder  Martin  Little Thunder  Martin  values are going to fall, technically, how to decide where the shadows  and the different colors needed to be. I also wanted to make it look more  hand-drawn. In some ways I didn   t quite get where I wanted to.  There were a few areas where you can tell where   because I actually  hand-drew all the transparencies before I created the screens.  Technically what you do is similar to the photo etching. You create a  transparency, and then you expose that transparency to the screen, and  then you push your ink through that. Each color has a separate pass. I  was trying to figure out how to use these old family photos, still get that  kind of a sepia-tone-ish old look to it.  This one   s one that   s fairly unusual in the fact that I used the straight  photograph. I didn   t try and add any other content, names, or numbers or  anything. I was really wanting to concentrate on just the imagery. I   ve  used this imagery over and over.  This is Aunt Kate. I was too little to   she was a distant relative of mine.  She was, I think, a second cousin to my mom, or a great aunt. I can   t  remember. Anyway, they were related. I never did get the opportunity to  know her, but she looks pretty feisty to me. (Laughter) I love this image,  and I   ve used it multiple times in a lot of different mediums, too.  Yes, I think that   s a real successful run at that type of printing. It really  is a great image.  I like the way it turned out. It was an experiment. I was experimenting  with, really, the process of screen printing and how I could adapt it to  what I   m used to doing. I thought it worked pretty well.  That   s great. Well, thank you very much for your time today, Bobby.  Sure, you bet. My pleasure.  -------  -------
