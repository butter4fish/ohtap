 Little Thunder  Rowell  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is February 10, 2013,  and I   m at the Tulsa Indian Arts Festival with artist Skip Rowell, who   s  done this show for many years. Skip, you   re of Choctaw descent. You   ve  won a number of top awards at some of the top Southeastern shows.  You   ve been named a Master Artist of the Five Tribes. You work in  multiple media, but you   re perhaps best known for your miniature  scrimshaw work, usually focused on wildlife images. Thank you for  taking the time to speak with me today.  Sure. You   re quite welcome.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Durant, Oklahoma. I spent most of my childhood in Atoka  County around a little town called Stringtown, and then I graduated from  high school in Atoka.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad was a barber. When he wasn   t a barber, he was fighting  somewhere. (Laughter) My grandma was a well-known bootlegger in  the county. But my mom, she kept everything together. She retired from  the Public Service Company.  Is your Choctaw on your mom   s side or your dad   s side?  It   s on my dad   s.  Did you have a relationship with your grandparents on either side?  Yes, I did. Like I say, my bootlegging grandmother was one side of my  dad   s family, and they were a little sketchy in places all through history,  5  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  you know. (Laughter) On my mom   s side, my grandfather there was a  welder and a lay minister.  So you got to be around both grandparents a little bit. Was anybody in  your family or extended family artistically gifted?  No, not that I know of. I think there was talent there, but it was  something that, back then in our culture, you just didn   t do. I can  remember when I was a child, I   d hide behind the bed and draw pictures  on cardboard boxes and stuff. My mom always tried to keep me in color  books when I was little, but my dad thought drawing and painting was a  sissy idea. At one point in my life, I completely quit for about fifteen  years and never even did anything because I just got tired of being made  fun of.    You   re not manly. You   ve got to do this. If you   re not hunting  or trying to kill something, you   re not on the main line.     One of the biggest influences I had, though, was my second grade  teacher. She was an Indian lady named Viva Lou Thacker. She took me  to my first art competition in the second grade to Durant. I   ll always  remember that. I drew a chicken. (Laughs) She encouraged me and kind  of fed what I was needing there, so that   s kind of basically how I got  started.  That can make a huge difference. So the ages when you were really  discouraged and you kind of put it aside were around nine or ten?  Yes, along in there. Twelve until I went to college. I have a degree in  commercial art and advertising from OSU Tech  Institute of  Technology . Then I went from there to Dallas, Texas, and worked for  Frontier Theaters Advertising. We were doing billboards for theaters.  I was going to ask you real quickly, did your grandma speak the  language? Did you get to be around the Choctaw language at all?  No, I don   t even remember them. About all they did was just cuss in  English. (Laughter)  That   s a good language for that, isn   t it? Did you have any other  teachers either at the secondary level or high school level that  encouraged your artistic talent?  No, when I was in high school, we didn   t have an art class there at  Atoka, but they was always coming after me to draw something     Your classmates?  6  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell     for the yearbook or something, different things like that.  So when did you sell your first piece of art?  Oh, gosh. I don   t even really remember. I think it was probably after I  came out of the Army.  Okay, not in high school.  No.  In the Army, did you utilize your artistic skills at all?  Yes, after they found out I could do some of that stuff, assigned to paint  the company logos on different things, and various occasions I got a  chance to use a little bit of it.  You enlisted, as opposed to     Yes, into the Army.  So you got a degree in commercial art. What kind of a base do you think  that provided for you that you draw upon today?  To be honest with you, really very little. Of course, the type of stuff I do  today really didn   t have much to do with that. I did work at Frontier  Airlines for a while in the silkscreen department and doing that stuff, but  as far as the type of stuff I do now, it really didn   t carry over much. That  was more commercial with silkscreen work and that type stuff.  At some point, you did leave Texas, and I guess you were working in  Dallas at that point. Was that a big change of environment for you?  Oh, yes. That   s an easy place to sin down there for a young man.  (Laughter) I worked there. It was a good job, but after about three or  four months of that, I   d catch myself   if I   d see somebody coming  down the street in a horse trailer, I   d trot along and try to see if I knew  them. It just wasn   t for me, being in an environment like that. I needed  some woods and some open air. (Laughter)  When you came back to Oklahoma, at some point you went to work for a  saddle maker and learned leather tooling?  Yes, I rodeoed for probably thirty-five years. That had an art  background, too, because of tooling and leather with the scroll work and  different things. I made a lot of saddles, repaired a lot of them. Made a  7  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  lot of leather goods of different kinds, you know.  So were you partially earning a living from rodeo and partly from  saddlemaking?  Yes. I made some decent wages at it, and I always had an eye for a good  horse. I bought and sold some good horses over the years and shipped a  lot of them to California and different places. It got to where when a lot  of people I knew in different states needed the right kind of horse, they   d  call me. I kept everything kind of rolling thataway, too.  Were you also drawing on the side a little bit while you were rodeoing?  No, basically not. A lot of times if we was going on a long trip, I   d take  me a piece of wood and sit in the back of the camper and carve out  something, and everybody   d gripe because there were woodchips  everywhere. (Laughter) I truly believe this. When I go to an art class to  talk to kids or young people, I   m a full believer that God gave every  human that was ever born a talent of some kind, but it   s in its infant  form. It   s up to you to develop it. If that   s in you, you   re going to be   .  I   ve sat in the woods and carved things. It   s there, and it   s going to come  out. It takes you to take it from the infant stage to polish it and perfect it  and get it to the point that you can   .  One of the worst mistakes that I try to talk to young people about that  have a lot of talent, it   s real easy   I saw this happen, and I know Merlin  has, too. You see a young person with a lot of talent. They have some  success, they sell a piece or two, and pretty soon they start making it to  sell. Anytime you do that, you   re going to lose it. You do each piece like  you plan on keeping it yourself, that you   d be proud to hang it in your  own house. Then if you sell it, you keep your quality in it. You keep  reaching for just a little bit more all the time. I do sell a lot of my stuff.  In fact, I   m a full-time artist. That   s the way I make a living, but I don   t  make it to sell.  That   s a nice distinction. So you were already, it sounds like, in your  early twenties, gravitating toward that three-dimensional work.  Yes.  Did your leather tooling provide any kind of base for your eventual  discovery of scrimshaw? How did you discover scrimshaw?  That was something that always fascinated me. Of course, my culture, I  love knives and different things. I would see some scrimshaw on knife  handles or pistol handles or something, and I never could figure how  8  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  they did it. I finally found a book. I don   t even remember who wrote it,  and if I did, I wouldn   t tell you because it was the worst thing I ever got  a hold of. (Laughs) I took that thing   it took me a year to work all that  stuff out of me to get it.  I looked at a couple of early pieces that I found in a drawer here about a  year ago, and it looks like you cut them out with a hatchet. That was  what I had got from that book. I just kept working down until I  developed my own tools, which basically is absolutely nothing but a  sewing needle stuck in the end of a dowel rod. That   s what I do all my  work with.  And you figured that out for yourself?  Yes.  Not from the scrimshaw book. Did the leather tooling help at all, do you  think?  Oh, yes, I still incorporate some of it. In fact, I sold a piece yesterday  that was on a scrimshaw piece of fossil walrus ivory, a little necklace  pendant. I used the same old leather pattern that I used to use in the  leather shop. Only difference was, instead of putting acorns or  something, I put little flowers and leaves and scrolled a couple  hummingbirds around it. So yes, you still use some of that.  That   s neat. So when did you first start entering shows, Native art  shows?  The first one I entered was   a friend of mine there in McAlester named  Christine Verner who has studied art from every famous artist in the  world, I guess, at one time or another heard that I was doing some  scrimshaw stuff and came and bought a couple of knives off of me and  encouraged me to enter an art show in Holdenville, a little small deal. I  did a couple of pastels, and I won a First Place with one and something  with the other one. That   s kind of where I got started.  I was scared to death. I didn   t want to take it because I thought then     and this is something else I share with young people. Just because you  enter a piece and you don   t win with it, that doesn   t mean your stuff   s  not any good. It   s either one or two men   s opinion. I have judged some  art shows, and I really have to discipline myself for not gravitating  towards the things I like personally rather than maybe this over here  with a little better quality. That has absolutely nothing to do with your  talent, whether you win First or Second or don   t at all because the next  place, it all balances itself out. That   s where I got started. That was the  9  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  first one.  At Holdenville. So even though she had bought your scrimshaw and was  interested in it, you entered pastels for that one. Were they wildlife  images?  No, the one I entered over there was a Plains Indian holding a spear and  shield. The reason I didn   t take any scrimshaw is because she told me,     I   m not sure them people even know what that is.    I have had the  strangest thing happen to me. I   m not going to tell you what art show it  was, (don   t want to offend anybody) but it was a well-known art show.  Still going on right now.  I had a piece of scrimshaw over there, and I went to pick my stuff up. I  didn   t win nothing, which, that   s okay. That curator told me,    This is the  beatingest thing I ever saw. I don   t know whether I ought to tell you this  or not.    He said,    We had two judges. One of them wanted to give you  First Place. One of them said that that wasn   t real, that it was done with  lasers.    He said,    They got in a argument, and what they decided to do  was not judge you at all. To be honest with you, they didn   t know what  it was.    So I have run into that.  So probably in the early days then, you were sort of in the process of  educating people about what scrimshaw was.  Yes, in this area. Now, it   s well known on the coast and different places,  you know, but it   s something was new for this area.  What kinds of materials did you start out using when you first started  experimenting with scrimshaw?  I have done it on just about anything you can scratch. I first started out,  because I couldn   t afford the real stuff and didn   t know where to get it,  fossiled ivory. I really made it a point not to ever use modern elephant  ivory just for the simple reason I love the old stuff better. It has better  color to it and stuff. I don   t want to offend anybody, or I don   t want to  get any kind of ivory that came from black market stuff, so I just always  refuse to use that. When I started out, I bought some imitation ivory. It   s  called micarta. It   s actually made from ivory dust and epoxy. You buy it  in sheets and cut it out. You can do decent stuff but nothing like the real  thing.  Was your subject matter primarily wildlife in the early scrimshaw  works?  Yes, did a lot of wildlife, and I   ve always did some type of Indian stuff,  10  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  maybe buffalos or I   d incorporate a tipi in something. Basically a lot of  it was just wildlife. Seemed like the market   I got started doing a  wildlife piece, somebody   d see that and said,    Well, do me a deer,    or,     Can you do this on that?    So there for a while I was pretty much just  doing   looked like this was the way to go, so I did a lot.  I still do some wildlife, but now I do a lot of, basically, Five Tribes stuff  anymore. I like to go back in the early stuff when the traders were  coming over and trading blankets and different things, and the tribes  were torn between the French and English colonies and all that. I   m  trying to work in that area.  I love the different types of   one piece I did, I really liked. I believe it  may be archived in the Five Tribes Museum. I think Ms. Griffin bought  it, but it was an Indian standing. Had a English trade musket, a French  blanket, I think it was a French knife, and a Spanish   all these different  things they were getting as trade goods, standing there. The look I  captured on that was like,    I don   t know which side to join. What do we  do? Where do we go from here? We don   t know. We   re caught in the  middle of all this turmoil, and we   ll never be the same.     I   ve got a piece that I   m working on now that I   m planning on putting in  the Masters show: a Spanish man standing there with all the old Spanish  garb on, the armor and all that, standing, talking to a Cherokee, basically  before they ever got anything, in the original dress, and a couple more  whispering over,    We   ll never be the same because here   s a guy fixing  to give us some blankets and the knives and all this stuff, so what we   ve  known all our lives is fixing to change.    So that area, I   m really  interested in trying to show right now.  That one piece sounds really wonderful, too. What was one of your most  exciting early awards?  I guess it would be winning the Best of Show at the competitive show  there at the Five Tribes Museum. That was the first time that I actually  felt like maybe I do belong in this.  Maybe this is what I need to do. It was for a piece of scrimshaw work?  Yes.  You also won Second Place in sculpture at Colorado Indian Market in  1985. Was that a bigger show than     Yes, it was a real big show. I never saw so many people in my life. It  snowed that night that we got there, about two feet. I told my wife, I  11  Little Thunder  Rowell  said,    There won   t be ten people here.    We go to the building. I walk in  there, and before the show opened, I walked to the door and looked, and  there   s people lined up as far as you can see, four abreast, in the snow,  waiting to get in there.  The piece that I was going to enter, I had came across   a man found an  old large whale   s tooth at a flea market, and he brought it to me. I  particularly was going to do this piece for that show out there. I started  out at the top after I polished this tooth. It   s beautiful ivory, holds a  tremendous amount of detail way better than elephant ivory, the  mastodon. I started out with a eagle at the top, flying, and then the  Rocky Mountains. It came down and circled this tooth. It had some big-horned  sheep, and then it came on down into elk. Then right down at the  bottom, it worked its way down to a beaver pond. I had it on a base, had  it on a base that turned, where it slowly rotated.  Well, I had told a doctor in Muskogee I was working on it, and he said,     I want to see it before you take it.    So we stopped by on our way to  Denver, and he was up in the operating room. He came down in his  operating gear. I don   t know what his patient was doing. Still had his  mask on and all that. I had it sitting on the hood, and it turned around.  He said,    What do you want for that?    I said,    I don   t want to sell it  right now because this is a piece I   m taking out there to enter in that.     He said,    Well, what   s First Place out there?    I said,    It   s a thousand  dollars.    He said,    What are you going to want for this piece?    Of  course, back then, I priced that cheaper than what the tooth   s worth now.  I said,    I   ll take five hundred for the piece.    He said,    Okay, so if I give  you fifteen hundred dollars, I can have this now, and you can play like  you won.    I said,    Okay     (Laughter)  We make the deal, and I get out there, and I   m not going to enter  anything. My wife said,    Yes, you are.    I picked up a little ol    piece that  wasn   t three inches tall and was on a base, and she actually took it and  put it in Sculpture. I said,    You   ve got to be nuts.    They had bronzes out  there and everything, and I ended up winning the category. (Laughter) I  was embarrassed. People look at you funny, but what do you do?  (Laughs)  You found a category. (Laughter) That   s a great story. You did a lot of  traveling to Texas early on. What was different from the Texas market?  What   s different between the two markets, Texas and Oklahoma?  Well, to be honest with you, (I   m an Okie through and through) the  money   s better in Texas. Even this year, I did a show there in   I can   t  think of the name of the town. It   s actually in Dallas (it   s just they call it  something else) at a show there in July, and you know as well as I do,  12  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  when the economy gets bad, art   s the first thing that takes the hit. That  show was an outside show, which I very rarely ever do one of them. I  don   t like them, but I did this, anyway. I just sold nearly everything I  had. The economy was better there, and that   s what made the difference.  Sometimes the business aspect of art is hard to master, and I   m  wondering what some of your early lessons in that area were.  I have never been much of a businessman. My banker just laughs at me.  He says   and I don   t know if this is true or not. I   m not a scientist. He  said,    Artists    brains are different than other people. You work off a  creative deal.    He said,    You let me handle your finances, and you just  do your artwork.    (Laughter)  One thing is (and still I get griped at) I don   t price my stuff high enough.  To me, I don   t know why anybody would want to give that kind of  money for something that I had fun doing. Now, if I was out there  digging a post hole, it   s different, but this, it doesn   t come hard. There  was times that you have to fight your way through different areas to get  to a point, but now I don   t really have to wrestle with a piece. I can  pretty much look at it for a while. I don   t just grab a piece and go to  work on it. I   ll keep it laying around for a few days and let it tell me  what it wants to be and then put it on there. That was probably my  biggest mistake was not pricing my stuff for actually what it was worth  or what it would bring.  What role does Cleora play in the business?  Oh, she keeps my clothes done up, washes my socks. (Laughter) She   s  been good to go with me as my helpmate, not just in life but in my art  business. She helps me cover stuff and makes sure the curtains are  straight and the table   s clean and all that, you know. It would be hard to  do what I do without her.  So you got busier on the show scene in the 1980s. Is that right?  Yes, basically.  What was one of your early galleries that you think was important to  your career?  Well, the first stuff I put in the gallery was in Mrs. Verner   s gallery   Verner Gallery and Fine Art  there in McAlester, and some of the local  clientele bought some pieces. My career has never just taken a great leap  from being here to there. It was a process. I think most everybody is that  way. People that buy serious art, they want to know whether you   re for  13  Little Thunder  Rowell  real or not. Are you just going to be here and do this for a while and then  going to be gone? Once you establish yourself and they know that  you   re going to continue, you   re going to be there, you   re going to  continue to enter shows, that your bio is going to grow   .  People buy art because they like it. I tell people   I   ve had people come  and look at my stuff, and my opinion, (I don   t know if this is correct or  not) when you first see something, if it appeals to you right then, nine  times   you   ll be happy with it. If you have to talk yourself into buying  something just because you want to spend some money to tell somebody  what you gave for something, it   s not going to be long, it   s in the back  room back there somewhere. That has a lot to do with it.  I don   t want to sell somebody something just because they want to spend  some money. I want them to like this. I want them to enjoy it. I was at  this same show back when we had it at the fairgrounds. I had a painting  that I did, maybe a eighteen by twenty-four, smaller type painting of an  Indian with a red blanket on. This young couple kept coming by there  four or five times, and they would look at it. I could hear them. They   d  step over there and talk.  I think the painting was like  750 or something. They were arguing,     We can   t afford that. We want that, but can we not do it?    I   m just  getting pieces of this. The show was about over, and they came back by  and looked at it again. I said,    Y   all really like that piece, don   t you?     Said,    Oh, yes, we love it. We just cannot work that into our budget  right now.    They were probably in their early twenties.  I said,    I   m going to tell you what I   ll do. If you   ll pay me for what I got  in that frame, I   m going to give you this picture just for the simple  reason is because y   all love it and I know you   ll enjoy it. I want you to  have it.    They liked to fell over. I still get Christmas cards from them.  I   ve had people that   s bought stuff that I knew they just wanted to spend  some money. I have to sell this stuff, but I got more enjoyment out of  giving them that piece than I did selling maybe some other pieces.  That   s a great story. How do you think the Native art scene changed  from the    80s to the    90s? Maybe you haven   t been on the gallery scene  enough to notice those changes, maybe booth shows, too. From the    80s  and    90s, how did it change?  It   s like anything that goes back, again, to how the economy   s flowing.  It has its ups, and then it   ll have its lows, and it   ll get back up again. I  still have maintained a pretty steady movement of my work through  these periods. A lot of times, I have developed a line of customers that  pretty much I can do something and know,    Hey, he   ll like this.     14  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Most of my stuff I sell over the telephone. I don   t travel like I did  because we adopted a little girl about eighteen years ago, and she was  just, like, two weeks old. I didn   t just want to leave this little orphan  with somebody to take care of them while we traveled, so I started  cutting back on shows and just doing local stuff. There   s more important  things in life than making money, so I cut back there.  Now that she   s   I have to brag on her a little bit. She scored a 33 on her  ACT and that wasn   t good enough. She took it again yesterday and  wants to get it up to a 34. She plays softball. She   s class president. She  just does everything. I think it   s like anything in life. You have to     what   s the word?  Prioritize.  Yes, that   s what I   m trying to say. (Laughter) You have to put things in  perspective, you know. As I continued to do my art there, a lot of times I  would depend on calling the customers.    I have this piece. I   ll send the  photograph of it if you   d like.    That   s the way I go. I have done business  with Eagle Tree Gallery down by Nashville  Tiptonville , Jere Ellis.  He   s been a good outlet, too. I know there   s times if we go to a show  and the crowd   s not very good and the show   s been a little weak, I know  times that he   s come over and bought things just on that account.  Developing relationships like that with gallery owners and people  that   you put it all in a pot and stir it up, and it keeps you going.  In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed. I wondered if you  remember the impact that had on the Native art scene.  Oh, definitely. I think its conception was a good thing. I   ve been to  shows where people were selling China-made beads and Japanese stuff  like that and pawning them off on people as Indian craft. I think that  definitely needed to have been stopped. I think that part was a good  thing. I think it kind of got out of hand. I know my family, we   ve  researched it, and I have enough documentation that I could get a card  right now, but I refuse to do it. There   s been shows that I   ve been kicked  out of on that account. People say,    Well, why don   t you do it?    It goes  back. Like I say, we go back and traced it back to an Indian named  Notoshtubbe who was an interpreter on the Trail of Tears.  I have copies of letters that my great-grandmother wrote so white men  could come into her allotment and work on her farm, but they were not  on the  Dawes  Roll because they did not want their children sent off to  some Indian school somewhere. That was a choice they made. I just  thought I would honor that. If they don   t let me in a show, I   ll just go to  15  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  another one. It kind of got out of hand thataway. I know up there at Lost  City  OK , there   s some Cherokee people that can   t even speak English  that are not card holders. They have to bring somebody with them when  they get ready to sell their stuff, and that   s wrong.  It has its pros and cons, and it has definitely affected some shows, and  some of them it hasn   t. I just learned to go with   that   s the thing about  being in this as long as I have. I can get into a show anywhere pretty  much when I want to. I don   t have to mail in photographs. I can just  send them a bio and go. It   s opened up for me, but it   s took time. I  actually think the Act was a good thing. It   s like anything, though. If  you   re not careful, it gets out of control.  How did it feel to earn that title, Master Artist of the Five Tribes? What  did that mean to you?  Oh, it was great. I had friends like Bill Rabbit. When I first got started,  Bill and I got to be good friends, and several others. Something that I  thought,    Well, I don   t know if I   ll ever make that or not.    I have never  been real high on myself as far as thinking that I am it. A lot of times  when I   d win something, I would actually feel self-conscious because I  won.  Anyway, it was a great thing. It was a real boost to my business because  it gives you certain authenticity. I have sold several pieces just because I  have that plate on my table that I am a Master Artist of the Five  Civilized Tribes. It gives you some credibility because most people  know you don   t get that unless you earn it. It took several years of  continuing with the shows and different things and winning. It was a  tremendous boost, and I   m proud of it.  What   s the most memorable comment or piece of feedback you got from  a collector?  I guess the funniest thing is I had a guy give me a moose antler one time.  I threw that thing around on my porch at the shop and kicked it out of  the way two or three times.    What am I going to do with this?    One day,  I got the idea to carve it, so I set it up, and I carved an eagle in it, put it  on a base and everything. In fact, I always have some there. It   s one of  my better selling items.  You mean moose antlers?  Yes. We were at a show   I want to say it was in Arlington, Texas. This  man came up with some friends he was visiting. He was from Norway.  He didn   t speak any English, but he fell in love with this eagle carving,  16  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  and he bought it. We got a phone call from the friends that lived in  Dallas and told me,    He would not let them ship that. He carried that  back to Norway in his lap on the airplane. He wouldn   t allow anybody to  touch it.     Then about a week later, I get this letter from Norway, wrote in  Norwegian, and I still don   t to this day know what it says. (Laughter) I  don   t know what happened, but I thought that   s pretty neat that this guy  liked that enough that he wouldn   t even allow them to mail it, that he   s  going to carry it in his lap. Here I   ve still got this Norwegian letter. I  don   t know if it   s good or bad, but I   m hanging onto it.  Until you find a translator. (Laughter)  Yes.  We   re going to shift into your philosophies and practices a little bit, a  little bit more technical discussion, but not super technical. Scrimshaw  work is very miniature, and it   s working in a different scale. What  helped you the most, get a hold of that scale?  Some of my stuff, actually, some of the things I do now are considered  large for scrimshaw because I do some pieces that are maybe two and a  half, three inches by four or five inches, and I put them in shadowboxes.  Basically, considering it against painting, yes, it is tedious, small work. I  don   t really know how to explain that question.  A lot of times, I may have to draw something two or three times because  I get it too   here   s the thing about the difference of scrimshaw than,  say, painting. Basically, painting, you   ve got a canvas, or you   ve got a  piece of paper, whatever. They   re all the same. That   s what I love about  doing this scrimshaw work. It   s always challenging. It always keeps you  on your toes. You don   t get complacent with it. Basically what I use now  mostly is woolly mammoth fossilized ivory. They   re coming out with a  lot of it now since the ice is melting up there and they   re getting some  good pieces out of Siberia.  It has tremendous color to it. You may start up here working on the top  of it, and it   d be firmer. The further you go, it starts softening up. You  have to just live with it and baby it along and pull out what   s in there. It  all has different shapes, different colorations. I just love it. In fact, I still  do occasionally get some Eskimo artifacts, Inuit artifacts. They didn   t  have the stone that we do here in this country, so a lot of their stuff was  made out of fossil walrus tusks and ivory, spearheads and harpoon heads  and sled runners and stuff.  17  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  In fact, I sold a man a collection of almost 300 pieces to one man that I  had bought back from a collector of mine who passed away. There   s  some tremendous fishing weights and different artifacts in there that   s  just really hard to get now. Working on those in the studio, and you   re in  there by yourself, and your mind goes to drift.    I   m working on  something here that a man seven or eight thousand years ago used to  feed his family, used to survive. He whittled this fishing weight out of     hacked it out of a piece of walrus tusk and put it on his sled and lived in  a harsh environment.    It   s kind of a eerie feeling sometimes to realize  this mastodon elephant roamed this country 75,000 years ago. Here I   ve  got a piece of it in my studio. I love doing that stuff. It   s a lot more than  just painting on a canvas.  The fossilized mastodon, do you order that online, or do you buy from  dealers?  I just bought two pieces here this morning from a friend of mine who got  it from a friend of hers in Arkansas that got it from somewhere else. I do  buy a lot of it. Used to, you could go   I haven   t, but it would   ve been  legal for me to go up to Alaska and go to the villages and buy this stuff.  When they were putting the Alaska pipeline in, I had a lot of friends that  went to work up there.  The Eskimos have a pretty severe alcohol problem, and one reason is  that they are so isolated with nothing to do, especially the young people  in these out villages. Well, these people that were up there, they would  trade liquor and stuff for huge pieces of mastodon ivory worth thousands  of dollars. It was getting out of there, so the government came in, which  it was really a great thing. Now it   s legal to sell it. They can sell it to an  authorized dealer.  See, they get a fair price for it because that   s the way they supplement  their income. They pick up a lot of this stuff around the same old camps  and villages that they traveled thousands of years ago. For goose season,  they go to goose camp. Well, they camp there in May, then they find  artifacts, and it keeps turning up. Instead of people just going up there  and beating them out of it, they get a fair price and supplement them,  helps them. I buy most of mine through a dealer like that.  When you   re working on wildlife images, do you take photographs, or  do you work from scrap, other photographs?  A lot of times I do, and a lot of times I use photographs that are in,  maybe, books or something. I don   t do much research on the native  animals because I   ve spent my life in the woods. I pretty much know,  but still you need to look at a picture sometimes just to make sure the  18  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  feet are right or whatever.  If somebody wants me to do an African lion, I   ve got to go find  somebody that took a photograph of an African lion. I have a file of  books, different National Geographics or different things. I don   t, per  se, copy the pictures, but I use that as a reference to make sure that  everything   s correct. I think that   s important, too, especially doing our  Native American stuff.  One of my pet peeves was (I guess I can   t use the names that I   d like to)  a famous Western artist who traveled from back East in a train, went  through and made sketches. Went back East and painted, did sculptures.  I looked at them, and I   ve been a cowboy all my life. One of them, a  famous sculpture of a cowboy, the saddle doesn   t have a blanket under  it. No cowboy would ride his horse without a blanket under it. One of  them, the bit   s turned backwards. Another man who is a famous Western  artist who lived the cowboy life did a lot of his work around the  campfire. All of his stuff is correct.  You owe it to   if you   re doing Native American stuff, you need to  know that tribe. You need to know what their dress was, what their  customs was, what the tattoos looked like. A lot of people don   t realize  that a lot of our early Native tribes, Woodland tribes, were tattooed. If  you   re going to do a piece and sell it to somebody, then it needs to be as  correct as you possibly can make everything on it.  When you   ve sketched, done a little preliminary sketching for a  scrimshaw or whatever, do you do it on tracing paper?  No, now I just generally do it on my piece. Once you get it polished out,  I just draw it directly on there. Sometimes I will. If I   m laying out a  couple different things, I may scratch out some little primitive layout-type  things to see if this buffalo head   s going to fit behind this Indian, or  if I want to put a turtle in or a dragonfly or whatever. That   s the thing  about doing a scrimshaw. If you   re doing work on paper or canvas and  you   re making your sketches, you can erase it. When you   re doing it on  this ivory, once you scratch it, you   ve got one choice: either make that  work or sand it off and start all over again.  Do you work on any other materials that you carve regularly besides  bone or fossilized antler?  Yes, I   ve done some bronzes. I   ve done about four bronzes.  What was that experience like?  19  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  It was pretty cool. It   s expensive, but I really enjoyed the process. The  friends of mine who run the foundry, The Bronze Horse     Where is that?  In Pawhuska. They were real flexible to work with. That process was  pretty neat. I   ve done scrimshaw on jade. You can basically do this on  anything you can sand smooth and scratch. It   s got quite a history. A lot  of explorers, the mountain men and stuff who opened up the West, a lot  of them didn   t have pencil and paper, but nearly all of them carried  white powder horns, and they would take a knife point and make maps. I  saw some of these in museums. They made maps to where the passes  were through the mountains and different things.  I was doing some research one time for a Bible class that I was going to  teach. I was looking through a Bible book that I had, and something  caught my eye. I looked, and there was this elephant tusk scrimshawed  that came out of a tomb in Egypt. What was depicted on it was the  scrimshaw of the exodus of the children of Israel. This goes back   it  actually goes back to a caveman taking a stone and scratching into a  bone and then rubbing some ashes in it, so it   s got a rich history to it.  Do you always have stories for your work? How important is story?  Oh, people like to hear stories. I try to be as factual as I can, up to a  point. (Laughter) Like that Western poet that says,    I   m going to tell you  facts as long as I can, but I   m not going to quit talking.    No, people like  to know why you did this, what   s the story behind it.  It   s like a lot of people that see Indian art. I did some paintings here.  Last year, I read the history of old Fort Sill about the Indian wars.  Growing up, I knew I always had some Indian heritage, and I wanted to  be Mighty Elk or Tall Bull or something like that. Come to find out, I go  back to an Indian named Notoshtubbe, which means Slow-Walking  Turtle. (Laughter) You know, when you go from there   .  Anyway, I did these horses, two different large paintings of one cavalry  horse and an Indian horse running loose after the battle. The cavalry  horse stepped on his bridle and broke a rein. The Indian horse I paint  with the symbols, and a lot of people don   t have a clue. They think that   s  just pretty decorations that they put. I said,    No, this handprint means  that he killed a enemy in battle. These horse tracks means he   s had  successful horse-stealing raids. These eye marks are clan marks.     They   re fascinated to know that those actually meant things, so people  want to hear what   s the basic behind what you   re doing.  20  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Do you title all of your things?  Oh, yes, I always try to.  Even the little scrimshaw     Well, the small jewelry pieces I don   t, but I had a piece of bark,  mammoth ivory, that I   d cut off. It had some bad cracks in it. I thought,     I can never use that,    so I sawed it off, and I had it laying around.  Started to throw it away, and I got to thinking,    I could seal them cracks  up.    It   s a neat-looking piece, had beautiful color to it. The way it come  out, the top had naturally been broken off, and it looked just like a  Rocky Mountain there. I   ve got it up there. It   s maybe three inches by  four and a half or something like that.  I did this old mountain man on it, and I put a little grin on his face, not  mean and gruff like a lot of them are, a little sneaky kind of grin on this  old man. Well, I thought,    I got to title this,    on the way to town. I was  trying to hurry up and get it up here so I could have it for this weekend.  I   m thinking on the way to town,    What am I going to call this?    I made  up this little poem on the way to town. Let me see if I can remember it.  I trapped a beaver and kissed a bear.  I   ve fought the Blackfeet and still got my hair.  I   ll live up here until Kingdom come,  for I am a mountain man, by gum.  I had that all put on this little piece. (Laughter) You got to have some  humor in what you do. This little guy looks just like he would tell you a  lie in a New York minute. (Laughter)  I hope I get to see that at the end. We   re getting to the close, here. How  did you come up with your signature? Was there an art to that?  Well, early, I tried different things, fancy stuff, and now I just write my  name. Always, if it   s on a bigger painting or a little small piece, I try to  keep my signature pretty minimal. I don   t like great big,    Look at me.  Look at my name. Don   t worry about what you   re buying here.    I   m  pretty self-conscious. You just put your name on there. If they look, they  do realize it   s done by somebody. Mine   s pretty simple. I started out,  and I have a feather with some of my early stuff and this and that. I  thought,    Crap, I   ll just write my name on it and go on.    (Laughter)  What   s your creative process from the time you get an idea?  Sometimes it   s pretty slow. (Laughs) I know that this happens to other  21  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  artists or, maybe, mechanics or whatever your gift is. Art has always  come fairly easy to me, but when it comes to being a mechanic or  carpentering, all I   ve ever done with a hammer or a wrench was mash  my fingers. I can   t fix nothing. My wife will not let me touch anything  around the house. She hires it done.  I wake up with ideas for a piece that I never thought of the night before I  went to sleep, but when I wake up,    I   m going to go do that.    I   ve got up  in the night and made quick notes. These come to you. I think the Lord  helps you with that stuff. I   m sure a lot of people that are working on an  engine and run into a problem, it comes to them the same way. That   s a  gift that   s been given you. It   s hard for me to explain other than it just  happens.  Do you have a creative routine? Do you work a certain number of  hours?  Oh, no. The crappie   s biting, fish are biting or the squirrels are cutting  hickory nuts, I   m out of there, man. (Laughter) That   s one of the things  that   s beautiful about being self-employed in my stuff. In the same time  I   m off out there, if I   m up a river in my boat, I just feel at ease with  nature, and I learn a lot from it. I see things. I see the bark on a tree, and  I thought,    I   ll remember that because I   ll use that.    Maybe a tree that   s  rotten and a limb   s broke, or a bird or whatever, it   s all staying in the  rhythm of life. I think it   s a big part of being an artist. I could not be an  artist if I had to get up and work eight hours a day at a studio. I may be  sitting there watching my cork go under, but I may want to paint that  crappie or a picture of it when it comes up. It   s all part of it.  Looking back on your career so far, what   s been one of the high points?  Well, you know, I guess one of the highest points was becoming a  Master of the Five Tribes. It   s always good when you sell high-dollar  stuff, and that   s always a high point. I enjoy winning. I   m not always  hung up on the ribbons. In fact, I got so tired of dusting that crap about a  year ago, I just threw them all in a garbage bag. It   s part of the business  because most of the time there   s pretty good compensation comes with  winning. It   s like found money. It   s part of the business. As long as  you   re winning awards, you know that you are keeping the quality of  your stuff up. You   re not getting slack and lazy and slinging it out there.  All of these things are part of it. I wouldn   t say it   s a real high point or  whatever. That   s really a hard question for me to answer. It   s all a high  point for me. I love it.  What   s been one of the low points for you in this career so far?  22  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  I don   t know if I   ve had any. There   s times that things get slow. When  people get scared of spending any money, things   ll get tight. That   s the  beauty part of being in this business for a while. Even in hard times or  when it   s slow, you can still sell pieces because you   ve got collectors  that buy them. I   ve got a jeweler at home right now, and he just started.  Saw some of my work about a year ago, and he wants me to bring  everything I do by and let him see it. And he wants to buy it. He   ll buy  that mountain man. He said,    I want to buy that, but you go ahead and  take it to show if you don   t want to sell it.    He said,    I   m going to build  me a collection.    I said,    I   m going to collect your money, so we   re  going to both be happy     (Laughter)  Is there anything we forgot to talk about before we take a look at your  art?  I sure hope not. (Laughs) I   m not a good interview. I don   t know much  about this kind of stuff. You may have to edit about half of what I told  you. I don   t know.  I don   t think so. Okay, we   re looking at this mountain man piece that  you were telling us the poem of.  Yes, that   s the one I was telling you about while ago. This is called bark  ivory. It   s actually the piece that   s on the outside that takes all the  weathering, and it looks just like a tree bark. If you was to see that  before it   s polished out, you wouldn   t even pick it up. You just, a little  bit of sanding. You can see the big cracks in that stuff, which is a  characteristic of ivory. All of it has some hair cracks of some kind in it.  You learn how to either incorporate them in what you   re doing, or work  over or around them. That was a fun piece to do.  It   s got gorgeous colors. It   s beautiful. All right, how about the knife?  Even the shape of the wood piece behind it is imitating that of the knife  handle. Do you want to talk about this piece?  This piece is done on a, actually it   s a warthog tusk that comes out of  Africa. I buy them through dealers. They   re just terrible-looking when  you get them, and actually as much work as getting them sanded down  past the enamel and polished. Once you get into that, it   s a beautiful high  grade of ivory that holds tremendous detail. With these, I   ve  incorporated the carving on the end of the eagle head, plus the adding of  the scrimshaw on the knife. Actually, I even acid etched the blades with  eagles and different things in there. I   ve really had a lot of success with  these. They   re pretty collectible, and they   ve been a good piece for me.  And you added the turquoise, too.  23  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Rowell  Little Thunder  Yes, a lot of times I   ll use turquoise or jasper or maybe black buffalo  horn. All of that combined, it just makes it work.  Beautiful.  The scrimshaw piece we looked at, I certainly don   t think I   ve arrived.  I   m still trying new things, still developing. It took me about a year to  learn how to color this stuff. I put some subtle color in it. You can   t just  use paint, or you can   t use dye. It   s a process that a lot of people now  that try to pick my brain.    How do you do that? I want to do   .    I   ll be  glad to help anybody, teach. I   m fixing to, maybe this summer, start  having some classes and passing some of the things that I   ve learned on  because I know I   m not going to be able to do this from now on, the  little tiny stuff. I   m nearly seventy years old, so it   s getting hard for me  to see. These are things that I   m going to share with other people and try  to keep it going on.  That   s great. How about this piece? This is just gorgeous.  This is one of the antler carvings that I was talking about earlier. This  particular one is carved from moose antler. Basically, moose carve better  than anything because they   re one of the few antlers that   s pretty solid  all the way through them. They   re not like a deer horn or an elk that  have that honeycomb inside of them. They make beautiful carvings.  They   re a little bit tricky because this one is actually thicker than some.  The thickest part   s about three quarters of an inch. You have to learn  how to get some three-dimensional work in such a thin area, so you  learn how to carve stuff back and set stuff forward. It makes it look alive  instead of just a dead piece.  Yes, with the fish and everything, it   s just gorgeous. Thank you so much  for your time today, Skip.  -------  -------
