 Finchum  Swander Sloup  Today is February 23, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project featuring home demonstration agents in Oklahoma.  Today, I   m in Enid, Oklahoma with Mary Lou Swander Sloup. She was  in Extension from 1953 to 1986, beginning with 4-H and then going into  home demonstration.  That   s right.  Thank you for having me today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell a little bit about yourself before you got  into this type of work. Where were you born?  At Helena, Oklahoma, on a farm.  Your parents were farmers then?  Yes. My dad was a farmer and my mother had been a teacher of grade  school, but she was a homemaker.  And then in high school where did you go?  To Helena High School.  And give or take, about when did you get interested in home economics?  I suppose when I first started to college. I had had home economics in  high school, but to really major in something for your future career,  when I went to college is when I decided.  5  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  When you were on the farm with your parents, did they have interactions  with home demonstration agents or county agents?  Both, yes. In fact, my brothers showed livestock so they were very  involved, too.  So you had a little bit of an idea, then, of what might be involved.  Yes.  Were you in FHA or 4-H yourself during high school?  I was in 4-H in the grade school and a lot of interesting projects there.  Then in high school, yes, I was with the FHA.  Where did you go to college?  I went to Oklahoma A M College, which it was known then. Of course  now it   s OSU  Oklahoma State University .  And graduated in what year?     53.  And what was your favorite class while you were at OAMC?  Oh, that   s a good question. I enjoyed a lot of the housing and clothing  mostly. Did fashion illustrating and that sort of thing.  Did you have to partake in the practice house?  Yes, I did that. That plus we did observation for a week and practice  teaching for a month, I think it was.  So right out of college you did what?  Right out of college I went to work about three days later as a 4-H agent  in Garfield County.  Did your college education prepare you well for that?  Oh yes, I think so.  Talk a little bit about a typical day then as a 4-H agent.  At the time I started I think we had twenty-five clubs that met in various  6  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  schools and pretty big enrollment at that time, too. We would meet with  each one of these groups and give a lesson. Each of the members had  projects that they were responsible for, so we would help them with their  projects. There was a lot of special activities, too. We took kids to 4-H  camp and they participated in the county fairs and state fairs. They went  to 4-H Roundup at OSU. Later, some of them that were achievement  winners would go on and attend Chicago to the National Congress, and  many, many other activities.  What type of things did you teach them?  It was in the area of home economics; the foods and clothing   but not  restricted to that. We did areas in personal development, career  guidance, that sort of thing.  Do you have a favorite story from that time period?  Oh, many  I   ve always said I   m going to write a book. (Laughter)  Could you share one or two with us?  Let me think.  A favorite student or something that didn   t quite work the way it was  supposed to or     Oh, many of those, too. They were most interested and very creative. It  was not a difficult job.  Let me back up a minute. What was the process of getting the job? Like,  who hired you?  We had interviews at the campus. I   m not real sure who was responsible  for it but the people that   s in charge interviewed you and evaluated your  education, your experience.  How did they match you with Garfield, or did you get to pick?  This county was open for an applicant and so that   s why I especially  applied for this county.  Then you did 4-H for how many years?  The 4-H program I did for twenty-two years.  A long time.  7  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Yes.  And I read somewhere where you did meat judging contests?  Oh yes. That was a favorite. (Laughs)  And what did that entail?  Well, you do a lot of training in meat judging   identification of cuts and  quality. After doing all of this studying, we had contests for them to  participate, usually as a team. We   ve had two state meat judging teams  to win and go on to the national, which was at the American Royal in  Kansas City. That was quite a trip and quite an experience, too. But it  was one of the best training programs, I think, because nowadays the  people that were participating in that, it   s helped them with their grocery  shopping and being able to select    Plus, another advantage is, they  have to give reasons and I think that   s one of the better training too, so  the kids learn to make decisions and give reasons. That   s good training.  When you would practice doing this, where would you get your meat?  The local butchers were really cooperative in setting up contests. They  saw the advantage of them learning about meat, too. They were most  cooperative in letting us come to their shops and have a trial contest; it  teaches all the different things, too.  So when you shop for groceries yourself, you go down through there and  pick the best looking  cut of meat ?  You bet. (Laughs) Yes.  So what are some of the things you look for?  Well, it just depends. You want marbling, you want the bone to look  young, you don   t want it to look aged. Color, texture   those are some of  the things. And on ham, you want it to not be soft. It needs to be hard     not hard but solid. The meat should be pretty much uniform color, not a  lot of different colors.  I   m learning something, too. (Laughs) So you would have to travel  around the county a lot in those days. Did you get mileage  reimbursement?  Yes, we did.  Or a company car?  8  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  No, no company car. You had a personal car. That was pretty important  because a lot of out of county trips, we had to take suitcases. So  whenever you purchased a car, you wanted to be sure and have a large  trunk.  To take your equipment type stuff with you.  Right.  Did you work closely with the county agent when you were doing 4-H,  too?  Yes.  The male counterpart.  Yes, the county 4-H agent, yes. We had a lot of projects together.  Where was your office?  We moved three different times but there is a county extension office.  And we moved three different times, so the very last we had a new  building out on the fairgrounds.  Did you teach arts and crafts too?  Not as much on arts and crafts. The emphasis would be more on use of  time, being creative, that type of thing.  What led you to choose this type of work? What inspired you to go into  this area, anything in particular?  Yes. It   s not confined to a classroom. You teach wherever it   s requested.  It could be a school, a home   We had conference rooms where we   d  have it or a lot of times, like the meat judging, it   s out in the field  wherever the subject is. So to me, that was very helpful to not be  confined to one room.  Did you have a dress code early on? Was there a certain uniform you  had to wear or anything?  Oh yes. This is going to show that I   m an antique. (Laughter) For my  interview, we were required to wear a hat and gloves. Other than that,  just dress appropriately.  In those days it was mostly dresses, I guess.  9  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Yes.  During your twenty years, did you inspire any young girls to go in to  your line of work?  Yes, there have been some that did go in to this work. I think that   s  because of their experiences in the 4-H club. We had one girl that went  clear on to work with a pattern company in New York.  That would be neat.  Yes. It really was exciting for her and for us.  So you taught them how to sew     Yes.  And how to cook?  Yes, but not just that. A lot of other things too.  In the twenty-two years that you were doing that, did your job title  change?  I started as assistant home demonstration agent then it was changed to  associate home demonstration agent, then it changed to extension home  economist for 4-H programs and that was it. Three different changes, but  they were similar.  And the job duties didn   t change much, just the title?  Not really.  Was there much room to move up in the career structure of the  extension?  Yes. As jobs would open up, you could either move to another county,  to another level or even on to the state specialist positions.  Did most of those go to the men or could women move in to those as  well?  At that time, I think either way. Depending on the projects, it sort of  took care of itself.  And if you liked your county you just wanted to stay in your county?  10  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Well, yes you could.  So after twenty-two years, you decided to become a home demonstration  agent?  Yes. At the time I went in though, the title was extension home  economist adult program. Before me it was home demonstration agent.  And how did that differ from the youth program? What sort of things did  you do?  It was adult programs. Probably pretty much the same topics, like  homemaking and home management and that sort of thing, but it would  be on an adult level. We had leaders training lessons where the ladies  would represent their club and come in and get the information. Of  course, we got our information based on research from the college  specialists. Then the ladies would take it back to their own group and  present it. So it was leader training, also. A lot of them learned to speak  on their feet that had not been doing that before.  How many clubs would there be for the adults in this county?  At one time we had seventy.  Seventy?  Yes. And you try to meet them as often as you can. (Laughs)  And now, do you have any idea how many there might be today?  I was afraid you would ask me that question and I   ve been retired and  gone and I really haven   t kept up with it.  Well at the time you retired, about how many were there?  Oh let   s see. I think about fifty-nine.  So a little bit less.  Yes.  So maybe a little bit less than that now, I would think.  Could be, yes. People get a lot of their information off of the internet  and a lot of people are going back to work and don   t have the time, so it  has made a difference.  11  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  And I guess you had to keep up with what was changing in the economy,  like if the price of beans went up or something, then you would adapt  your program for that?  Yes, that   s true. In fact, there was a time when people were really having  a hard time with bankruptcy and so I thought I needed to get a class in  money management. So I went back to OSU to get a class in that and it  helped us to work with people who were going through big trouble and  help them with their budgeting, help them with their expenditures. So  that was a different phase.  It   s almost like you had to be a jack of all trades.  If you didn   t know it, you had to learn it. (Laughter) I   ll say that.  And did you go back and get a master   s? You said earlier that     Yes, I wanted to get a master   s degree and Phillips University was right  here in Enid and they didn   t have home economics offered, but I   d found  out I could build on my BS degree by getting into Elementary  Education. So my MS degree was in Elementary Education. Above  everything else, the thing that I treasured the most is learning all about  the teaching methods. I was teaching anyway, in various subjects and the  teaching methods are what helped me.  And they hadn   t covered that in your undergraduate?  Oh I   m sure they did, but you have to do it much more thoroughly if  you   re in the classroom every day.  That   s true. And you had boys and girls through 4-H?  Yes.  Do you have a favorite memory from that time, a highlight of your 4-H?  It   s always exciting when they win and get to go on trips. The kids are  real devoted to trying as best as they can, too.  Well, talk a little bit about a typical day in the field when you were doing  4-H. How early would you get to the office and how long would you  work in the afternoons or weekends?  Oh, that   s a good question. I always tried to get there early enough to get  organized before everything else started happening. Then you had phone  calls, locally, that you had to answer. We had meetings to have to go out  12  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  to attend or maybe the meetings would be right there in the office. You  didn   t just quit at five o   clock, you worked until the job was done. We  had a lot of night meetings. If you were studying or preparing for some  lesson, you might have to work on the weekend or even over your  vacation time. But it was interesting, I don   t begrudge all the extra  hours.  Well the phone calls, would it be questions like,    How do I do this?     Yes.  And if you didn   t know, where would you go to find the answer?  Our extension specialists from OSU did a real good job of keeping us  up-to-date. If it was something that we weren   t familiar with, that   s who  we called. In fact, one time we had a scare on, I think it was canning  tomatoes. I had the food specialist to call and ask her if I could tape her  conversation so that I would have it on tape to play with our groups at  our meetings. So that worked out real good.  So you taught canning?  Yes. (Laughter) And during canning season, it wouldn   t be surprising to  have a phone call every ten minutes.  Asking what sort of things?  Oh, how to can something. What   s the proper way, how to freeze things.  If they   ve had problems, what to do about that.  If the jar wouldn   t seal or     Yes, right, how to have it to properly seal.  And did you teach them how to make kraut?  No, I didn   t get in to that. (Laughs)  That   s my favorite. That   s why I asked.  Oh, that   s your favorite, yes. We had to know how and how to teach  them to do it, but I didn   t really do it very much.  Well, in the fifties did they have canning stations in Enid, where people  would come to one central location and can?  13  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Not during my time. I was going to tell you one incident that happened.  One of my favorite stories is a lady that called on how to preserve  mangoes. We hurriedly researched the answer and called her back. She  said,    Well, I have a seed and I wanted to plant it.    (Laughter) We  thought she had the mango and was ready to can it.  Well mangoes don   t grow here so it   s unusual to even have that question  to start with. Did you find out and call her back on how to grow one?  Oh well, no. Her question was how to preserve it, so I don   t know that  we really got into how to plant it. (Laughter) But I thought that was fun.  Sure. Any other odd questions like that?  Oh, if I could remember them, yes, a lot of them. (Laughs)  I know pressure cookers were popular at that time.  Yes.  Would people call with it exploding, going to the ceiling or anything like  that?  No, didn   t have any problems like that. Mostly, like you said, some of  the problems with sealing.  And you taught them how to sew. Anything in particular?  Everything. Fitting   how to fit and alter. I had some summer youth  programs   in fact I was asked on the street one time, I was carrying a  sewing machine. The lady that was reading meters, she said,    Why are  you always carrying something?    So I told her that I was teaching youth  some sewing. She said she had a daughter she wanted to enroll in that.  So I opened up a whole summer of sewing classes   I don   t know  whether we had cooking too or what. I think our total one summer was  six hundred and something kids.  My goodness.  We had a meeting room and the sewing company would loan me five  different sewing machines and keep them working. We were able to  educate a lot of kids that way.  So Enid had a sewing company or would you have to get them from a  bigger town?  14  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  No, Enid had it.  And fabric wasn   t hard to come by?  No, not at that time. It would be now. We have one or two fabric places  left in Enid now.  Wal-Mart doesn   t even carry it anymore.  No, it was a big disappointment. (Laughs)  During some of your sewing things is when polyester was in?  Yes, yes. And permanent press. We had a lesson on how to care for  permanent press, I remember that. Sewing polyester. Another thing we  got into is tailoring. Women had to tailor their jackets and suits and we  had a category in the fair for them to exhibit them. We had classes on  that.  Do you still do some of your own sewing?  Some. Not as much. I did then, and my sewing was at night mostly,  when I was working.  Did you have children?  My children? No. When I remarried, after my first husband died, I  inherited some bonus children. (Laughs) So now I have a stepdaughter  and a stepson.  Before we got started, you mentioned having to do programs for the  radio.  Yes.  Talk a little bit about those.  Every subject that you thought the people would be interested in, or  especially updates or new information   it was a five minute radio  program and each one of us took a turn and did it every day for a week.  That was another thing that we had to really keep an eye on and find  subjects to do.  So you went to the station and recorded it there?  No, we were able to make it on tape and then deliver the tape.  15  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  And you just picked whatever topic you wanted or what might be of  importance at that particular time?  Yes, that   s true.  How many years did you have to do that, roughly?  I don   t remember when we started but it seemed like we always did it.  Several years.  Yes.  And it was just one or two weeks a year, or during the summer?  All year.  So you had to have a good radio voice then.  Yes. We had some radio announcers that we could mentor with that  helped us to know how to do it.  I wonder if they kept any of those.  I have no idea.  I   m assuming you had to do reports.  Yes.  Monthly or yearly?  Spasmodically. (Laughter) Yes, we had lots of reports. You have to be  accountable for what your work is.  And were they handwritten or were they typed?  I don   t remember. I think probably we   d get them in pencil and then  have them typed up to return.  Any idea of where those might be now? If the county office keeps them?  Oh no, you wouldn   t have room for them.  So they just destroy them after a certain amount of time?  16  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  I think so, yes.  When it was time for you to learn something new, did they come to you  or did you all meet like in Stillwater and one person teach a group of  people how to do the next thing?  It   s been both. Sometimes we   d meet at Stillwater, sometimes Oklahoma  City. The whole state was divided into districts so sometimes you had  your meetings just within your own district so there was fewer counties.  So if that happened frequently enough, you could make friends with  other agents.  Oh yes. Well we worked back and forth across county lines quite a bit.  Not just with leaders programs but with judging affairs. So yes, we had  to work together.  And there was a state association?  Yes.  And if I remember correctly, you were the president of it for a time?  Yes,    84 to    86.  That must have been an exciting couple of years for you.  Oh it was very exciting, yes. We had a lot of planning to do on that,  because it   s on a bigger level, state and national subject matter that  would help everybody.  When you would go to the state conferences, would you learn a new  lesson to bring back to your county?  You could use it that way, yes, but whoever planned it usually planned it  according to some of the needs of the agents.  When you were learning how to do the work with polyester, because it   s  different from cotton, did you have to go somewhere to learn how to do  that or just experiment on your own?  That and our specialists would put out what we called fact sheets. It   s  information printed so that we could receive that to help us with  different subjects. In fact, since I   ve been retired, I   ve requested some of  those fact sheets for the things that I   m involved in.  17  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  And you   ve been retired since    86.  Yes. (Laughs)  So if you started right out of college, you retired pretty young then.  Yes. There was a time when   I   ve forgotten now how they added it up,  but you could retire at age fifty-five. I think it was you had to have so  many years plus your age in order to retire. I qualified for that, so that   s  when I retired.  And you   ve been busy ever since.  Yes. (Laughter)  Do you find that some of your older families keep coming back to you  for answers to questions?  Oh sometimes when I see them at stores or something like that, but  when I retired, I purposely got out of town so they would work with the  new personnel. And too, I was not receiving the information, so I had a  good excuse not to. I would have enjoyed doing it, but I don   t think it  was my place to be working with them. But yes, now occasionally when  I meet somebody, they   ll ask something. Like the other day, somebody  asked me how to keep brown sugar from getting so hard.  And what did you tell them?  Either put a little piece of bread in there or a slice of lemon and that  softens the brown sugar.  Do you belong to a club yourself   a demonstration club, or whatever  they might call it now?  No, I was invited to join, but at the time I retired, my late husband was  able to retire too and his goal was to travel, so we spent winters being  Winter Texans in South Texas. So I would have been a poor member,  because I would have missed a lot, but it would have been a joy to be a  member. But no, I don   t belong to one now.  And do you can now?  Not so much can, I do a lot of freezing. I have canned, but now I just do  freezing mostly.  Do you have a garden?  18  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Oh yes. I have pictures. (Laughs) I do tomatoes and cucumbers. This  year I want to do cantaloupe. I think one year I had a tomato that  measured fourteen and a half inches around.  Did you enter it in the fair?  Oh, no. I haven   t entered anything in the fairs.  Well maybe that   s something to do.  Maybe I should have.  One that big   that   s a pretty good size.  It really was. In fact, I have a picture of it with the tape measure around  it so you can actually see for yourself that I   m not just kidding. (Laughs)  How did it taste?  Delicious. Home grown tomatoes. That   s why I grow them.  They can   t be beat.  Yeah, they   re delicious.  Well besides traveling around, have you done other things, work related,  since you   ve retired? You were a snow bird for awhile     Yes.  And then you remarried later. And now grandkids are keeping you busy.  Oh very. We have tea parties, we do everything. They   re getting older     they   re nine and twelve. That was one of their requests, was a tea set.  They like to see mine, which is seventy years old. (Laughs)  Do you anticipate teaching them how to sew or how to cook a particular  thing?  I have offered, because I told their mother and grandmother that in 4-H  you teach them at nine years old. But they   re pretty busy right now with  their school and so forth.  If they need something mended, they come to you?  No, they go to Grandma.  19  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  She knows how to sew then.  Yes, she does.  Well at any point could you have moved to a different county if you had  so chose?  Yes, there were times when situations became available either to another  county or even in the state office.  And when you first started, could you be married?  No, you could not. In fact, I was the second one to work being married. I  had to get approval to get married and to continue with my job. I learned  that I was the second one to ask. The first one to see my engagement  ring was the district home economist.  So if you started in    53, when did you get engaged?  Must have been    54, because we got married in    55.  So a couple years later, then.  Yes.  And then maybe after that, did they change that rule?  Oh yes. Yes.  And do you know the reason for not encouraging women to marry?  The reason, I think, is the economy at that time; they wanted people to  have one job per couple. It was really harder to get a job. I think it was  the same way with teaching school.  In the fifties?  Yes.  And then into the sixties, civil rights and that sort of thing came into  play. Were there any issues with integration or segregation in your  work?  Not really, because those summer youth programs that I had was open to  anybody. Everybody could take part that wanted to.  20  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  And then in the seventies, they changed and weren   t directed so much at  rural families; they included city people too and poverty became an  issue and commodities and that sort of thing. Did you have to deal with  any of that?  Well, just the nature of our program is available to rural or city. There  got to be fewer and fewer people on farms, moving to town and  working, and they still had the same questions and problems, so I think  that it was just natural to work with them.  A few changes each decade, then.  That   s true.  But the philosophy probably didn   t change that much.  No, I don   t think so. It   s an exciting and real good program, I think.  And you went to Stillwater occasionally for meetings.  Yes, we had meetings there frequently.  And they came to you on occasion too, then?  Yes, right. You could schedule them to come whenever you had a topic  that you wanted them to present.  When you were working with the clubs, did they choose their topics or  did you choose?  We had leaders to suggest topics and that comes from the clubs. Plus the  new topics that our specialists were offering, so we   d have quite a  selection of topics to offer. And then the groups would vote on what  they wanted and select it down to the one per month and that   s what  we   d go with. We tried to distribute it so that it was various subject  matters; not have all the same kind.  Did you do lessons on the microwave?  Yes, we did have lessons on the microwave, because that was new at  that time, too.  And did a local store loan you a microwave or did you have to furnish  your own?  I think they would have, but I think we had purchased one for our  21  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  county. When we got the new building, we had a kitchen so we needed a  microwave in that kitchen, so we had our own.  Are there some other kitchen appliances that came along during your  time period that you want to talk about?  New ones or different ones?  The only thing I can think of is maybe a food processor might have come  out then.  Oh yes. We would have given demonstrations on that. In fact, I gave a  demonstration one time   I can   t remember now which group it was that  was having a workshop for newly married and I was to give one on the  use of equipment. So it was any of the latest or the newest equipment.  The other thing would be a Crockpot.  Yes, how to use that for the best success.  Which is not always good, is it? (Laughs)  Not always. But you know I use one an awfully lot because of being  gone. You come home and a lot of times the meal was ready. (Laughs)  So it was a convenience.  What was your least favorite part of the job?  Oh, goodness. I suppose the number of hours you have to put in. But to  get the job done, you have to do it.  Did you get comp time?  No.  So if you worked weekends, you just worked weekends.  That   s right. You worked until the job was done.  Probably played in to why you retired when you could.  Well, that   s true, yes. (Laughter)  Do you remember what your salary was at the very first?  I wish I had looked that up. No, I don   t remember. I sure don   t.  22  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Back in the fifties, probably  3,000 a year or something like that.  It paid the bills. (Laughs)  Do you think there   s much difference from county to county on what   s  covered, what the clubs would want or what the agent would have to do  from county to county?  I don   t know that there would be a great difference, but yes, there would  be differences.  And would you have your own budget or would that be handled by  someone else?  No, that would be by county also, yes.  I   m sure you had to work within one.  Yes, you do, right.  And when you would demonstrate stuff that would come out of the  budget   the materials would?  Yes, right.  Did you teach how to make bread?  I   m sure we did.  What was your favorite thing to teach?  Oh, my favorite   I have so many favorites.  Sewing or cooking or if you want to do a broader subject.  Oh, home life, home management, cooking, sewing     All of it, huh?  I think about all of it, yes. No particular favorite.  Well home management would include what, keeping a home budget?  Yes, budgeting, filing     Any discipline for children? Did that ever come up?  23  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Yes. That really kind of comes under home life. Yes, we had that too.  A little bit of everything, then.  That   s true.  Kind of like a librarian. You get asked a lot of questions and if you don   t  know, you say,    I   ll find out.     That   s the truth.  And did your clubs do cookbooks?  Yes, they did. That was a money- making project. They would do a lot  of different projects. A lot of them was community service. I can   t think  right now, but I   ve got some copies of things that they did do. But they  did do cookbooks, yes.  So if you had to do it over again would you?  Oh yes.  And would you pick Garfield County again?  Oh yes. (Laughter)  I   m not sure how far Garfield is from Helena, probably not that far?  About thirty miles.  Well, not too far.  See, Helena is in Alfalfa County; it   s a different county.  And once you started this job, did you go home and tell Mom and Dad  how to do something if they weren   t doing it right?  Probably. (Laughter)  You said you had a couple of brothers?  I had four brothers.  And you   re the lone daughter.  Yes. But I wasn   t the youngest. (Laughs) I always add that.  24  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Did the four brothers go to college as well?  Yes, most of them did, yes.  To OAMC or to other places?  One went to Enid Business College, which we no longer have. Two  went to OSU and that   s it.  And they didn   t go into extension work?  Well, my youngest brother went into FFA and agriculture work, yes. In  fact, I think he had the college livestock judging team and I had the 4-H  meat judging team and we were both at the American Royal at the same  time. I thought as we arrived there,    I wonder if I   ll see my brother.     And as we pulled up to the hotel, that was the first person I saw, my  brother. He thought that was unique that we both had teams there at the  same time.  That   s something to share.  Yes, it is.  So what was your maiden name?  Simpson.  Simpson. And his name?  James Simpson.  Did he go to OSU then?  Yes.  I   ll have to look and see what we can find on him, too.  I think he got his master   s degree. I   m not sure. I   m sure it was there but  I don   t know whether it was he attended there or whether it was some of  their extended courses.  Did you have to keep up with many of the federal regulations? Like, I  know if you   re working with dairy there were certain things with how  you handled the food and things like that?  Oh very definitely, yes. Safety, yes.  25  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Did you have to wear a hair net when you were working in the kitchen?  Oh yes. That drives me batty now because the food workers do not wear  the hair nets or caps. And the other thing that bothers me about that is  you couldn   t wear jewelry while you were cooking. You could lose a  stone in the food. Nowadays you see demonstrations on television all the  time and they have their rings on. That bugs me a little bit, too.  Do you still wear an apron when you cook?  Yes, I wear a cobbler apron.  I   m not sure what that is.  Well, it   s like a sleeveless blouse. It goes all over. I like that better than  just tying one here because you can get your clothes dirty otherwise.  And do you make those yourself?  I haven   t, because you can buy them pretty cheap. I   ve got four of them.  (Laughs)  Easy to find, then.  Yes.  And I guess in 4-H you would probably teach them how to make one.  Would that be a part of one of your sewing lessons?  It could be. On our summer programs, mostly what I taught them was to  make shorts. You know, you had mostly straight seams and one or two  curved seams, plus the band that you put elastic in. When they got them  finished and tried them on there was a big smile across their face. They  didn   t think they could make a pair of shorts. It was summer time and it  was something that they could put on and wear.  Would you have fashion shows then, at the end of the class?  Yes, we did that. In the regular 4-H program, we had style shows every  year and they made all their projects. Each year I think they had a  particular item they were supposed to make. And it would be sponsored  by a company or a business. We   d have style shows, yes.  And invite the community in to see?  Oh yes. If they   d like, yes. And the adult program had style shows, too.  26  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  The boy   s 4-H program had what they called    appropriate dress,    which  I thought was neat because it teaches them what to wear when.  They didn   t have to sew though?  No, they didn   t sew. But how to put clothes together   socks, shoes   to  be dressed appropriately. I think that was good training.  Sure, for certain events?  Yes.  I remember learning how to hem. That was the hardest thing for me.  (Laughter)  Hand hemming is a little bit harder than machine sewing.  Yes, I know it was for me. I had to redo it three times before I could pass  that section.  Sometimes that   s what you learn the most from is having to redo  something.  Yes, I still use that same technique. Is there something I have forgotten  to ask?  You   ve got a good background for this.  It   s fun. When you were on campus in the home management class, what  were some of the things you had to do in the practice house? Was it for  the whole quarter or semester?  I think we were there a month. We had to prepare a meal and serve it to  some outside guests that we invited in. You had to learn how to set the  table, how to serve the table, how to cook    Oh, what else did we do?  Of course, anything that has to do with the home.  When you graduated, had you planned on getting into 4-H or were you  wanting to teach high school or   ?  I would have done either. Yes, I would have done either.  You just kind of fell into this one and liked it.  I preferred it because it is outside the classroom. (Laughs) We have  classrooms but it   s in homes or schools or meeting places.  27  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  Swander Sloup  Finchum  And you get to meet a lot of different people I would think.  Oh, yes.  And develop some relationships with the ones that you   d see regularly.  That   s true. And, like some of the 4-Hers that I worked with became  adult extension homemakers and even like now, I still run across people  that I have worked with, like the nurse at my doctor   s  office  used to be  one of my 4-H members. It   s just an intertwined relationship with people  that you   ve worked with.  That makes life fun too, doesn   t it?  It really does. It tickles me to death to run into somebody that I had  worked with before.  Well, that pretty much wraps up my questions. I appreciate you sharing  your stories with us today.  I hope I did well. (Laughs)  You did great.  -------  -------
