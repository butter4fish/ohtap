 Finchum  Easterling  Today is June 9, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University Library, and we   re conducting an oral history project  called Women Extension Educators. I   m in Anadarko, Oklahoma today  to speak with Mary Easterling. She began with Extension back in 1957  in Kiowa County as an assistant home demonstration and 4-H worker  and then retired in 1987 as Extension home economist/4-H worker in  Caddo County. Thank you for joining me today. Let   s start by having  you begin with telling a little about your youth, where you were born,  and then we   ll work our way forward.  I was born in Fort Cobb, Oklahoma, about seven miles south of Fort  Cobb, southwest. I was born on the farm and in the home. The doctor  came out to deliver the babies in people   s homes at times and I was born  in a new house that my parents had built. My grandparents had  homesteaded just across the road from where my dad bought when he  came back from service after serving in the First World War. My mother  had grown up while he was in the service, and they got married when he  came back from the service. They first lived in a rent house for awhile,  and my two older sisters were born there. Then my grandfather and my  father built a house on the land that my dad had bought and I was the  first child born in the new house.  I have a big family. There were seven girls in the family and one boy.  The boy has two sisters younger than him so he   s kind of unique because  we probably babied him an awful lot. I   ve always kind of felt sorry for  my sister-in-law because he was probably spoiled when she got him. We  raised cotton and wheat and cattle and we did chores around the farm,  and we had livestock. We had hogs and we had cattle. We learned real  early to help with the family chores.  My mother and my fraternal grandmother were charter members of the  home demonstration club called South Pioneer Club and they were very  5  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  active in their home demonstration club. And some of my aunts were in  that club, too. This club is still going, and for a short time after I retired I  joined it, but I have decided it would be best for me not to.  I was always a happy child and we had a happy childhood. My mother  was a very intelligent woman and probably ahead of her time. She felt  like girls should be educated as well as boys and, you know, this doesn   t  always happen in families in that era.  What were some of your chores?  Well, we fed the chickens and hogs and     Would you have a particular one?  Well, no, we all helped with everything. We all kind of worked together.  And when we had a garden, we always weeded and gathered the food in  the garden, and we helped with the house inside. Now, I never did iron.  One of my sisters would rather iron than work out, so she did all the  ironing.  Where did you graduate from high school?  I graduated from high school in Fort Cobb.  And did they have a 4-H or home economics group?  They didn   t have a 4-H in Fort Cobb when I was in school. However, I  just went to high school there, from ninth grade until I graduated as a  senior. I went to a country school out in, it was called South Pioneer,  until I was in fifth grade, and then we moved to Eastern Oklahoma, I  think it was in Mayes County, and I went to Center View School. I  belonged to 4-H there for a couple of years when I was in school. The  leader was our teacher, and our teacher lived in Tulsa, and I remember  going on a 4-H trip to the zoo in Tulsa with that teacher.  How did you become interested in that as a career?  When I was in high school, I had a very good home economics teacher  by the name of Lois Tilton, and she inspired me to go into home  economics.  And then after high school graduation, you went to?  Oklahoma College for Women, in Chickasaw. One reason is it   s very  close to my home. Then we liked to be close to home. I worked at  6  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  college to pay my way through college. I worked in the dining room at  Willard Hall. Then I worked for Ms. Russell, who was the head of the  home economics department, in her office the last year and a half of my  school year.  So you graduated from college in 19     Fifty-one. I graduated actually in midterm, and then I finished out that  year, in    51, as home economics teacher in Sand Springs, Oklahoma. I  was there a year and a half.  During college, did they have a practice house or a home management  house?  Yes, we had a home management house. My senior year I lived six  weeks in the home management house and then had six weeks of student  teaching. I did my student teaching at Cyril, Oklahoma and the home  economics teacher there was very inspiring. She was very good to us.  And do you recall one or two speakers who came to your class?  Well, yes. When we were in college, Margaret Fitch was in El Reno as  home demonstration agent, and she spoke to our group. We had the  home economics club, Alpha Eta, and she came to one of our meetings  and spoke to us. I was inspired by her, too.  You graduated in    51, and then you started extension in    57. You had  taught high school for a year and a half, then what?  I got married and I lived on the farm out southwest of Fort Cobb, only  four miles from where I was born. After my child was three years old I  started to work, in 1957.  How did it come about that you got to     To work? Well, Martha Schultz was the home demonstration agent in  Caddo County, and I had known her. My mother was in the club and she  had mentioned that they needed a home economist in Kiowa County,  and wondered if I would be interested in applying. You know, farming is  not the most lucrative job in the world. We have lots of crop failures and  that kind of thing, and so it was kind of imperative that I start to work.  Do you remember the day you interviewed?  Yes, I remember the day, but I don   t know what the date was. I do know  that my husband and I went to Stillwater, and interviewed at Stillwater,  7  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  and was interviewed by Norma Brumbaugh, who was the state leader,  and Ms. Martin, who was our district agent. I   m sure that there were  other people there, too, but I don   t remember their names right now. It  was a real nice experience. They asked lots of questions and delved into  my background and hired me right there on the spot.  So you could work in the county you lived in, at that point?  No, I worked in Kiowa County, although I lived in Caddo County. I had  a room at a lady   s house in Hobart. I came home on weekends, and a lot  of times in between.  And how long did you do that?  For about a year and a half, and then I went to work with the Indian  program. OSU Extension had a contract with the Bureau of Indian  Affairs for work with Indian people. The purpose of the Indian program  was to encourage the Indian people to take advantage of the ongoing  program. I worked with the Indian program from    59-   73, and then they  didn   t have the program any longer. At first I served four counties;  Caddo, Kiowa, Cotton, and Comanche counties. I was in the Comanche  County office for fifteen months. Then they hired additional people with  the Indian program for Comanche County and Cotton County, and  moved me to Caddo County. So I was back to my home again.  What were some of the things you did, particularly with that program?  We had extension clubs and we had monthly meetings and monthly  lessons. I had Indian people, Indian women who had gone to the  homemakers    conference in Stillwater sometimes. I learned a lot from  the Indian people, and I hope that they learned from me, too. I think that  they probably used the overall Extension program more than they did  before that program. We worked with the Indian Soil Conservation  Service and the Indian Health Service. I had nutrition lessons as well as  baby clinics and home visitation, and workshops, both sewing and food,  and I taught a lot of food preservation lessons.  Canning and freezing?  Canning and freezing, both.  That   s changed a little bit since     Yes, yes, and we got into some drying. All the homemaking skills were  taught; home management, financial management, especially nutrition  and sewing.  8  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  When you first started, did you have someone to mentor you?  Well, the home demonstration agent was very helpful.  That   s right. You were an assistant first. Had your studies at the college  helped enough?  Yes, immensely. I think that people in Extension are very fortunate  because we have all the background from OSU. If we are asked a  question in the county that we can   t answer, we can pick up the phone  and call a specialist or call the state office and they   ll get on it right  away. If they don   t know about it, they   ll find out. This is one of the  reasons that I think that it   s one of the best jobs in the world, because  you have so much support.  Describe a typical day. How early would you get going and how late  would you roll back home?  Well, there really probably wasn   t very many typical days, but I usually  left the house around seven or seven-thirty and I would be at the office  at eight most of the time. We had night things and sometimes it would  be ten o   clock before I came home, but most generally around six.  And did you do county fairs?  Yes. County fairs. And that is a tool that a lot of people feel that it   s real  interesting. I was kind of apprehensive about fairs, but I did a lot of fair  judging in the surrounding counties. It   s always a good experience.  You worked some with the youth and adults?  Yes.  Did you have adult camps?  I never had an adult camp, but I had youth camps and that was the  hardest thing for me. I wanted the camp to be fun, but I wanted it also to  be educational. It   s a real hard job. When you have over a hundred boys  and girls at a camp, of course you have leaders there to help and team  leaders that help, and they have three meals a day it   s a big job and it   s  very tiring. It   s a very responsible job because you have so many  children with different interests and problems, too. I know one instance  where a little girl, her daddy was supposed to pick her up from camp,  and we went to Red Rock Canyon up by Hinton, and she lived in the  Hinton area, but he miss queued. She didn   t have anybody to pick her up  and she just started walking home. Well, I saw her and went and got her,  9  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  and then I took her home. She was very upset because her daddy had  forgotten her.  Did you take very many groups up to the 4-H Roundup?  I went to 4-H Roundup from    73-   87. Well, I didn   t go in    87. I retired in  January, so yes. And 4-H Roundup was a real good experience for the  boys and girls. Caddo County was very active in 4-H. We had lots of 4-  H members, sometimes 1500 4-Hers in the county, and you know, as the  years went by it was a little bit less. I don   t know how many they have  now. It   s changed a lot since I was there because the interests of the boys  and girls have changed. I think that 4-H has kept up with the changing  times real well.  Did any of them win trips to     Washington, D.C.? Yes.  Chicago or St. Louis?  Just Chicago. We had boys and girls that went there and I accompanied  a group to Washington, D.C. and the National 4-H Center one year. That  was a hard job too, but it was an interesting thing. I had never been to  Washington, D.C., so it was a real nice experience for me and it was a  real nice experience for the boys and girls.  Travel by plane or by car?  Bus. We   d had a bus that left Oklahoma City, and we went to  Washington, D.C., and of course we spent the night on the way. Coming  back we did the same thing. Coming back we stopped at Six Flags. Not  Six Flags, but in Tennessee,  Opryland . We stopped there, and the bus  driver slept. We were there the whole day, eight hours, so he could get  some sleep. Then we left there that night and came on in to Oklahoma  City.  In your early days, do you have any favorite memories of things that  didn   t work quite right, or that you were surprised by or something?  Oh, I don   t know. We always had problems. Sometimes people weren   t  on time or that kind of thing, but I don   t know of any real interesting  things that might be     You practiced your demonstrations at home before you did them?  Yes. A lot of times I did and, of course, I   ve always done canning and  10  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  freezing at my home, so I was pretty well experienced with that. And we  had an opportunity to improve on our skills with in-service training,  which is very, very helpful. And it gave you methods of presentation so  you could keep the interest of the group.  Where was your office located?  The office was always in the courthouse, except in Kiowa County it was  in the post office, in the basement of the post office building in Hobart.  In the very beginning you had to have a reliable car, I would think.  Yes. You owned your own car, but you were paid mileage. In fact, I  changed cars every two years. I had a    57 Ford, and then I had    59, and  every two years after that I changed cars.  Can you give us an idea of how big your territory was?  Caddo County is a pretty big county and when I worked with the Indian  program, when I first started out, I had four counties, so it was a big  area. Sometimes I would drive over 100 miles in a day, you know, and  this is one of the things that I had to get used to. Since I   ve had a drivers  license I   ve always been a pretty good driver and I   ve always maintained  my car, and I have a good car. I never did have a wreck on the job. I   ve  had flats and I   ve gotten stuck in the mud, but always could get some  help. A lot of people helped me with that kind of thing. When I was  taking some things down to Cement, I had a tool that put a dent in my  gas tank and my gas tank was leaking. I had to leave my car down there,  and my county agent came and got me and rescued me. Then my  husband had to go get the car, tow it back to the garage.  So you had a pretty good working relationship with your county agent?  I   ve never had any problems at all working with the people and the  people that I worked with were top notch. I can   t think of a job that you  could   ve had more professional and interesting and intelligent personnel.  We   ve always had a real good working relationship with everybody in  the county and I   ve worked in the Kiowa County, in the Caddo County  office, and then the Comanche County office. Then I worked with Betty  Dalms  Lewis  at Cotton County and she was very helpful, too. She   s a  very intelligent woman and very helpful.  You developed quite a network.  You really do. The county agents worked with the commissioners in all  instances more than the home demonstration agents did.  11  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Did you ever have to figure the budget or was someone else doing that?  Someone else did that. The county director did that. When they named  them county directors, they used to be the county agents, then they were  county directors. I   ve never had any budget work with the  commissioners or anybody else.  When you   re out shopping, do you still get stopped?  Sometimes. And I see a lot of people, now, that I don   t always  remember them. Caddo County is a big county and we had a lot of 4-  Hers, and they grow up and their parents get older, but they recognize  me and they speak. Sometimes I can recognize them and sometimes I  can   t. I   ve been retired for twenty-three years and I may be too old. I  don   t think that that has much to do with remembering.  Have any of your 4-Hers gone on to be home demonstration or county  agents, or work for Extension?  Yes, I had a girl from Fort Cobb who was in Extension. She isn   t any  longer. She   s married and has two twin boys. I think that there probably  are others that I   ve kind of influenced to get a job in Extension.  You mentioned earlier that your mother and grandmother were involved  with homemaker clubs.  Well, it was home demonstration clubs.  Home demonstration. When you first started, roughly how many  homemaker clubs were up and running in your county? Home  demonstration clubs?  Well, the Indian clubs, I only had three. Now, in Kiowa County I think  there were around fifteen or so. And in Caddo County we had as many  as thirty at one time, but I don   t know how many they have now.  That was my next question. Probably less, I would think.  I really don   t know, but I think there   s still a lot active, because I read in  the paper where they meet, and their lessons, and it   s always interesting.  I knew a lot of the women in Caddo County because I did help with the  home demonstration program some, like when the agent was on  maternity leave and that kind of thing. Of course we all worked with the  fair and we attended their county meetings. Also, when we started  having leader   s lessons for the clubs to present their lessons to the club  themselves, I met a lot of them that way. We helped with leader   s  12  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  lessons and that kind of thing.  Did they ever make a quilt for you?  Yes. When I retired. I have a beautiful quilt that the 4-H clubs all made.  They embroidered a block and one of the women here in Anadarko put it  together and people in Hinton quilted it. It   s a lovely quilt, a green and  white quilt. I should have brought it to show it to you.  Were you surprised?  Yes, I was. Very surprised, because it was a lovely, lovely thing. They  brought it to my retirement party.  Green for 4-H, I guess.  Yes. Of course. Every club   s name is embroidered on a block. It   s very  pretty.  When you very first started, you said your husband was a farmer, on  nights that you had to work late he could pick up the slack?  I guess Leonard probably thought he raised Lucy from the time she was  three. I had a lot of good help. She had lots of grandmothers. She had  two great-grandmothers that lived in Fort Cobb. When I first started to  work she stayed with her great-grandmother, Leonard   s grandmother.  And my mother helped a lot with Lucy, and Hazel Easterling, my  husband   s mother, helped a lot too. She got off of the school bus at their  house until she was in the fourth grade and she kind of decided she   s big  enough to go home. Her dad always watched for her.  Was she interested in canning and sewing and that type of thing?  No. She   s a good homemaker and she   s the best little grandmother in the  world. She   s a retired teacher now. She taught first grade most of the  time. She has lots of talents, but no sewing skills. She did her 4-H  projects with her mother standing over her, sometimes, but that   s not her  thing.  She   s educated in a different way.  Yes. She has a home economics degree in early childhood education  from OSU. She graduated, oh, I don   t really remember,    73 I guess. She  was a very good teacher, I   m sure. She taught thirty years in Carnegie,  Oklahoma. She still lives there and that   s just seven miles from my farm  where I live and she takes care of me now.  13  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Do you still can yourself?  Some, not very much. I don   t have a garden anymore. When I had a  garden I always did. I do can some, like black eyed peas and that kind of  thing.  When you were working, did you teach sewing classes?  Yes.  Where would you have to go to get your fabric?  Well, we used to have a fabric store here in Anadarko. I guess they  probably still had a fabric store when I retired. Then, of course, Wal-  Mart had fabric for a long, long time. Some of them do not have fabric  anymore. I think that most of the time it was pretty readily available  during the time that I was working.  Did you have to do some polyester work?  Yes.  Or stretch knit?  Yes, we did lingerie workshops and that kind of thing. I did workshops  with some of the home economic clubs, home economic classes in  Caddo County, too. You know, you went through different things where  people were interested in different things. We did tailoring. I helped with  a tailoring workshop in Kiowa County with Arlene Sellers, Arlene  Golden then. We had about twenty-three or twenty-four in the class. We  met several times for the tailoring workshop. It was very good. We had  different sewing workshops in Caddo County, too.  And how popular were the classes on, what is it, Weight-Off, or  something like that, wasn   t it?  Yes, there was a Weigh-Off program. We had a group that met here in  the Christian Church, in fact. It was not a real popular program, I don   t  think. I think there were several people who were real interested in it and  did a good job with it, but it was not a real popular program in our area.  What was your least favorite part of the job?  4-H camp. (Laughs)  Not your monthly reports?  14  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Well, the monthly reports were a pain, but it was something that you had  to do. I never did dread things like that. I had a newsletter, when I  worked with the Indian program, that I called    Talking Drums.    It went  out to several people in the area. It kept them informed of all the  activities that were going on and encouraged them to participate in the  ongoing program. Usually we had a little recipe in there or something of  that kind and I think the women really enjoyed getting that.  Did you keep copies?  I don   t have any copies. I don   t understand why I don   t have anything  like that, but I don   t have. And as my narrative reports, I have no idea  where they are.  Where would you turn them in?  We turned them in to the county office and then they went to the state  office. I don   t know whether they   ve kept them or not.  I   ll have to do some checking.  I think that would be a good idea. When I was thinking about this, in  fact, I couldn   t remember the exact year I went to work with 4-H in  Caddo County. I called the county office and they didn   t have the  records so they called the district office and they gave us a number. I  thought that was interesting that we didn   t have those reports anymore.  I   m sure that sometimes they were better than others, because sometimes  you could put more effort into writing the narrative reports. Sometimes  if you were real, real busy, you would get it in a hurry and it probably  was not as extensive.  Was it hand-written or typed?  I always hand wrote it, and then my secretary typed it. I had the  privilege of having excellent secretaries everywhere I was. Mabel Shook  had been a secretary in Kiowa County for a lot of years when I went  over there. She was very good. Then Patsy Vaughn was our secretary  here, and she still is. She   s going to retire this year. I think she   s been in  the office for forty-five years. Then the secretary in Comanche County  was very good, too. Betty Bell was secretary here in Anadarko before  Patsy was.  I bet they could probably answer as many questions.  Yes, they probably could.  15  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Did you do any radio?  Yes, we had a radio program in Caddo County when Anadarko had a  radio station. Each of the agents in the office rotated on a weekly basis,  so it came around every five or six weeks, you know, depending on how  many people were in the office.  How would you plan your topics?  Mostly from things that were sent to us from Stillwater for the  newspaper and for radio, a lot of times. And sometimes there   d be  questions come up. Then there were seasonal things, too, like when it   s  canning season. And sometimes people called in questions, too.  This area was mostly wheat and cotton?  Well, they have wheat and cattle, yeah. More a farmer/rancher area.  In the early days they taught how to can meat. Would you have had to do  that?  Never have canned meat. And I didn   t make any mattresses. Now, a lot  of the women before me did that. My mother canned meat when I was a  child at home and, of course, I helped with that, and we helped with  butchering and stuff, too.  Did you ever have to kill a chicken?  Oh yes, I   ve killed lots of chickens. I can dress a chicken real fast.  Did you have a particular method?  Just like my mama taught me. And when I cut up a chicken, I know what  I   m eating. You don   t always know that from when they   re cut up at the  butcher shop. I like the way that I cut up the chicken a lot better than I  do the other way. I guess I   m kind of set in my ways.  Do you include a pulley bone?  Yes. I like to have the pulley bone. I think it makes the breast cook a lot  better.  You can   t get those much anymore.  No, because they just cut the breasts in half. Then the breasts are thick  and it   s harder to get it cooked real good, if you   re frying it.  16  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Well, do you raise your own chickens now?  No, I used to raise chickens, but I don   t anymore. I   ve gotten lazy as I   ve  gotten older.  Your parents were farmers     Yes.  And then your husband farmed, and you still live on the farm     Yes. I hope I can stay there as long as I live.  And you have one daughter.  One daughter.  Did any of your siblings get into Extension work?  No, no. No. There   s a lot of teachers in my family. My oldest sister was  a teacher. She lives in Oklahoma City and she retired from teaching.  Then I have one sister that worked as a secretary for an oil company and  I have a couple of homemakers. Then I have one sister, my youngest  sister that   s living, she   s had lots of different jobs. She   s done radio,  she   s done dress shops, she   s done a lot of jobs. Then my sister who  lives in Yukon, she taught school but didn   t retire from teaching because  she has five children, so she   s really a homemaker.  Would they call you for answers to questions like,    How would I get this  stain out?    or things like that?  I   ve had lots of questions about things. I   ve helped a lot of people with  different things. My little sister-in-law used to sew for her children when  they were small and her husband was a mail carrier. Sometimes he  carried my mail on the rural route and sometimes he   d leave garments  for me to put the button holes in at my house for my little sister-in-law.  Does your sewing machine still work?  Yeah.  Do you have one of the fancy ones, or     No, no, I just have a regular sewing machine. I don   t sew as much as I  used to. My little great-granddaughter wants to learn to sew this  summer.  17  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Some of these new ones are just too hard, I think.  Oh, there   s really fabulous ones. I   m just going to teach her on the  straight stitcher.  I still have my 1971 singer, so that   s what I use.  Now, my sister that lives in Yukon, she has a fancy machine. She does  lots of work sewing. She   s only four years younger than I am, but she  still sews. I don   t sew very much anymore.  Over the course of your thirty years, were there a couple of things that  really changed in that amount of time? Computers were not in before  you retired, were they?  They were beginning to get computers in the offices, but I am  completely computer illiterate. Now, I say that, but after I retired and  after my husband died (I was only retired four years when he passed  away and I   ve been a widow since    91), I did work for a peanut buyer in  Fort Cobb. I learned the peanut program on the computer. I did that two  years, in the fall, just a little temporary help at a peanut buying point.  There   s lots of peanuts grown in Caddo County, too. I should have  mentioned that. There   s not as many as there used to be, but there is  some.  I   ve noticed that there   s some different crops coming. We have a field of  canola on my road and it   s been real interesting for me to watch. It stays  dormant, then it blooms in such beautiful yellow flowers, and then it has  little seed pods on it. In fact, my little great-granddaughter has been so  interested in that field because she lives in Kingfisher, and there   s one  up there by her. We   ve taken her for all the different stages. In fact, my  daughter crawled over the fence to get some of the stalks of the canola to  show her, when they had it in a wind row for combining, so she is going  to have some more education on the canola.  She may be the next home demonstration agent     You just never know about that. She   s only eight now.  So, in those thirty years went from handwriting to mimeograph to copy  machine. Maybe that   s the biggest change.  The mimeograph. You know, we mimeographed lots of things.  Sometimes I helped out with that. The secretaries could get behind with  mimeographing material that you needed and sometimes I remember  running the machine a little bit. Also helped with soil testing too, if they  18  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  got behind, you know.  Jack of all trades, master of a few.  Yeah. And we used to always test the pressure cooker gauges in our  office. We did that. The secretaries kind of liked for me to do that,  because they felt like I did a better job than they did.  People don   t use those too much anymore either, do they?  No, they don   t. No. And, it was real important for the gauges to be  correct.  And did you do cookbooks?  Caddo County put out a cookbook one year. We had lots of them come  in and everybody helped with it in the office. There   s lots of editing, you  know, and you had to check over to see if the recipes were     Tried and true?  Yes. We didn   t always test them, but we wanted to be sure that they had  everything in it that was supposed to be in it. We had to read them over  and see if they could be well understood, you know. We did that.  You could tell if something was missing, an ingredient was missing?  Yeah, or, you know, if they forgot the salt or whatever.  Do you use one today? A cookbook?  A cookbook?  Just to put you on the spot.  Since I   ve retired, I   m not a real good cook. I know a lot about nutrition  and I know I have a good diet because I work on eating vegetables and  fruits. I know the content of foods that I shouldn   t eat. I am too heavy  and I need to work on that more. The thing that worries me about elderly  people is that they don   t have good nutrition sometimes. I hope that I  don   t ever get into the habit of not having good nutrition. I try to be sure  that I have a good diet.  Did you do particular programs with the elderly before you retired?  Some of the women were older, you know, that we worked with, and of  19  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  course, I think that that   s one of the things that probably need to be done  more. I really don   t know for sure, but I feel like I know that some of my  friends don   t have good diets, my elderly friends. And I know the little  girl that comes and helps me clean my house, she worries about some of  her other people that she cleans for, if they don   t have a good diet. She  always is asking me things so that she can help them.  Still educating.  Still, somewhat. And I do have people that call me sometimes for things.  When I first retired, I had a lot of canning questions, you know.    How  do I do this?    and I   d answer them. I kept a book by my phone, because  I did have quite a few questions about that, but I don   t have any  anymore.  Still have the book, though?  Yeah, still have my book, but I don   t have a lot of questions anymore.  Can you think of some highlights or high points of your thirty years that  you want to get on tape?  I had a lot of good experiences. One of the things that Caddo County  did, they always had a ski trip. I   ve gone on ski trips. I never skied. I  didn   t have time to ski. The ski patrol would be saying,    Mrs. Easterling,  meet me at the flag pole,    if I had a downed skier, you know. It was an  interesting thing to do. I went on two of those. Then we got a younger 4-  H agent man in our county and he went on those ski trips after that.  I took a group of kids to Six Flags  Amusement Park  one time and we  had a real nice experience. We, the 4-H officers and county officers,  took them to Six Flags. Since I was older than a lot of the agents that  worked with 4-H, they were surprised that I could do the rides at Six  Flags and that kind of thing. And, you know, it   s kind of fun to shock  them a little bit.  We had an exchange program with Kendall County, Illinois. I think  that   s the name of the county. They came, they brought thirty-some 4-  Hers and adults to Caddo County one year and lived in our homes for a  week and participated in our ongoing things that we had in the county.  Then the next year, the next summer, we went to Kendall County,  Illinois, on an exchange trip. We had about thirty people go and 4-H  leaders and I went with the group. It was a real nice experience. We  went to Chicago to the Board of Trade. This was an opportunity that our  boys and girls wouldn   t have had if we hadn   t done something like that.  We   d love to do things like that. We also went to the Lincoln Memorial  20  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  and it was a real fun experience. They had a square dance for the group  and a barn dance.  We went on picnics and different things. We saw them shelling corn and  we don   t have that in our area a lot. We do raise some corn, but most of  it   s not kept on the farm like they do in Illinois. So it was a good  experience. One of our 4-H leaders had the lead car and then I was the  back car. There were five cars in the group and we drove to Illinois and  back. I had one of those baggage things on top of my car. My lead car  could see me real easy and kept up with the whole group.  You were the caboose?  Yeah, I was the caboose. That was a good experience. And then my 4-H  trip to Washington, D.C. was a good experience. And then we had  homemakers conferences, very educational and good, and 4-H Roundup  has always been a real good experience for the boys and girls.  Got out of the county at least once or twice a year, sounds like.  Yeah. And then we had in-service training, you know. That   s a good  thing about it too, because that kept you abreast of all the opportunities  that were available. The specialists are very good to help with subject  matter. It   s just a good experience because you have so much support.  And it filters down and filters back up.  Yeah.  Well, would you do it again?  Yes. I would do it again.  Without hesitation?  Yes, if I were young, I   d do it again. Yeah. In fact, I really think it was  an ideal job for me, because I got to be with a lot of interesting people,  and I had the support of a lot of very good personnel to work with. It  was a very good experience for me.  This has been a good experience too, learning about your story, so I  appreciate you sharing it today.  Well, I do hope that you   ll learn something that you didn   t know about  before.  21  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  We   re going to tie this up a little bit with a few last questions and one  has to do with gender differences regarding pay and promotion and  insurance.  Well, the men were paid more than the women. I don   t know whether  that still is true or not, but from the very beginning it was that way. In  fact, when I first started to work, well, the men   s health insurance was  paid, but the women   s wasn   t unless they had a dependent husband.  Through the national and state home economics associations we did get  that changed and our health insurance was paid. So I felt like that this  association with the state and national meetings was very worthwhile. I  had the privilege of attending, probably, most every state yearly  meeting, annual meeting, and I went to several national meetings. I went  to a national meeting in Portland, in Denver, in Phoenix, and Missouri. I  think that   s about it, but it was a very nice experience.  Was Oklahoma one of the few states that didn   t pay insurance for  women?  I don   t know about that. I don   t know the details on that. I do know that  it was a concern of all the association. The state association was really  behind it. And we   ve had national presidents from Oklahoma during my  time. Cleo Bryan was national president and she was a very colorful  character, as well as a very efficient person. She started to work in  Caddo County under Martha Schultz, in fact. Martha Schultz was still  working when I started to work, too.  Connections     Then Cleo Bryan went to Paul   s Valley and then she went to Tahlequah.  She was a state association president and she was national president, too.  And by colorful you mean?  By colorful I mean she was one of a kind. She had a delightful sense of  humor and was a very intelligent woman.  She could give an entertaining talk?  Yes. Yes. She was most interesting and outgoing.  Well, you mentioned some cross-county work. Do you want to talk a  little more about working with your colleague in the next county over?  Sometimes we had leader   s training, leader   s lessons. This was for the  home demonstration clubs, mainly, and sometimes when a person had  22  Finchum  Easterling  worked up a program with visuals and everything, it just only seemed  real practical for her to present it to more than one group. So we had  leader   s lessons and they would come and present at least in our county.  Then we might present a leader   s lesson in their county. Cooperative is  not only just a word, we really were cooperative.  And you mentioned earlier that you did an exchange with and then you  mentioned another country?  We had an exchange program all over the state with Japan. We had  Japanese students who lived in the homes in Caddo County. They had  Japanese students that lived here for a time and then at the end of their  stay in Oklahoma, they had a meeting in Oklahoma City with the whole  group and left to go back to Japan. The Oklahoma Cattleman   s  Association helped with that. The Japanese students were real impressed  with cowboys and Indians because of Oklahoma   s experience with  cowboys and Indians so they had their pictures made with the cattlemen.  Also, I took a group of Indian dancers from here in Caddo County up to  Oklahoma City and they presented a dance program. The Japanese  students who wanted to could have their picture made with the Indian  dancers and they enjoyed that a lot. It was a nice exchange program.  We also had a girl from the Netherlands, or had some students from the  Netherlands, who came to Oklahoma on an exchange program. Thera  Bray lived in my home for three weeks. She was a very interesting girl.  She was about the same age as my daughter at that time. It was an  interesting experience to have her in our home. I know the first time I  heard about her, they knew where she was going to stay. I had a card  from her brother who said that he was fabricating a letter. What he really  meant was he was translating it into English because he knew that we  didn   t read their language. So he wrote me a letter telling about their  family and they sent a family picture. She was a delight to have in our  home. She was in our home for three weeks and then she was in a home  down in Apache for a couple of weeks and in another county for a  couple of weeks and it was an interesting experience.  We were on TV in Oklahoma City when we went up to pick them up.  When we got home they were showing it on TV on, I think, WKY. She  was delighted that we got home in time to see ourselves on TV. Then  she was ashamed because she said her parents would think that she was  too proud. Another experience that she had was with food. She was  supposed to prepare a meal for her host family of their foods and so she  did that in our home and we enjoyed that so much.  She helped us move irrigation pipe, just like Lucy did on the farm, and  she was a real delight to have. She also thought that the food in  23  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Oklahoma was a lot different. When we ordered a hamburger here in  town, she wanted to know where the implements were to eat it with. And  she thought that a baked potato should be prepared in the kitchen,  because we always put the butter and sour cream on it, you know. She  said,    I wish they would prepare it in the kitchen.    I thought that was  interesting. She married and she sent me an announcement of her  wedding and I sent her a wedding present. I don   t still correspond with  her, but I did for several years. It was a nice experience.  Wide variety of paths she   s crossed with other people.  We had a group of men from Africa that came to observe the Extension  program in Oklahoma. They were in our county and they went with me  one day to see what I did, to get acquainted with the area, and see some  of the crops and some of the different things in our area. It was a nice  experience, too. They, luckily, spoke English, too.  Do you remember roughly when that was?    60s,    70s,    80s? What  decade?  It was in the    80s.  In this area of the state, were there any issues with segregation or  integration?  Not that I was aware of at all. We had some classes, and everybody was  encouraged, in the overall program. We had some workshops for black  women with sewing and their problems with fitting are different than a  lot of people   s. It was an interesting experience. They also participated  in the weight program, too, the black women in Anadarko.  Well, the fitting, I had read in the early days that they did muslin. They  made the outfit out of muslin before they did it out of expensive fabric.  Most of the time we did that in tailoring, or in that kind of thing. That  way you didn   t cut into the expensive fabric. It was a good idea to do  that. I know when my granddaughter got married, I did that with some of  the girls that I made their dress, because of fitting problems, and I was  glad I did.  Is muslin a little bit better than the paper?  Yeah. And then, you know, if they weren   t available to try them on I  made the little muslin top and sent it and we made the corrections.  Then when it came back, you took it apart, and used that as a pattern?  24  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Yeah.  Okay. I wasn   t quite sure how that worked.  Yeah, that   s the way it worked.  Any interesting stories of when you were traveling with the different  groups? People   s reactions or interactions, or     We really had a good time, and like I said, some of the 4-Hers were  surprised, because I was older when I worked with the 4-H program, that  I could do some of the things they did. They wanted me to be sure and  get in the canoe on the lake and I was kind of apprehensive about that  myself, but I did it. Then when we went to Opryland, why, I participated  in the rides and they were kind of shocked at that. It was, I think,  probably a good experience for them because they need to know that not  everybody is young.  Inter-generational and     Yeah.  Set an example by leading, I guess.  I think that   s right.  Anything else come to mind?  I don   t think so.  Do you remember what your pay was when you first started?  No, not exactly, but it was very low. I should remember, but I don   t.  It probably seemed like a lot at the time.  It seemed so. It helped us a lot. It was very helpful, because we   d had  some lean years on the farm, so it was real helpful.  After thirty years, you retired before you were sixty.  I was fifty-nine when I retired. My husband was not real well and I  thought it was a good time to do that. My parents were gone then, but I  had a lot of care of them, too, before, during that time. In fact, I think  that all my annual leave was used for taking care of my parents, most of  the time during the time that they were ill.  25  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Easterling  Finchum  Well nowadays, thirty years, people don   t stay with one job that long as  often as they once did.  No, that   s true, that   s true. They don   t.  And would you have had opportunity to be promoted if you moved to  another county?  I never did have an opportunity to move to another county. One of the  reasons, probably, is because of my situation. They probably knew,  since my farm was here, you know     Thank you.  -------  -------
