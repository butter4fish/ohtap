 Simpson  Matthews  Today is May 26, 2011. My name is Lynne Simpson and I   m on the  faculty of the Oklahoma State University Library. I   m in Boley,  Oklahoma, to interview Mary JoAnn Matthews as part of the Oklahoma  Oral History Research Program   s Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History  Project and our topic today is Boley, Oklahoma. Thank you for inviting  me here. Would you tell me when and where you born?  I was born north of here in the Chilesville, Clayton Chapel, area, which  is an outlying community and did you say when? December 19, 1945.  Would you tell us a little about your youth and where you grew up?  I grew up basically here in Boley. My folks moved from out in the  country to over here in the country to the Rusk area two miles west of  here. (Laughter) That   s basically where I grew up from the time I was  five until I graduated from high school.  Would you describe your family, your siblings, and extended family  here?  I have one sister  Henrietta Hicks  who is eleven years older than I am.  My family, both my parents were born and raised in the outlying  communities of Boley. They lived here all their lives. I lived here the  majority of my life. I went away to college, came back, moved to  California, lived in Houston for a year, worked in Sapulpa, and came  back here from California in 1976.  How did your family come to live in Boley?  My grandfather on my mother   s side, who was Sam Ashley, heard about  a place in Oklahoma where black folks could govern themselves, own  5  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  their own land, and he moved his family here. My mother was one of six  children all having been born in Boley.  Would you share a little about your educational background, and start  with elementary school, through college?  I went to elementary school at Boley Grade School, graduated from  there in eighth grade, went to Boley High School, graduated from Boley  High School in 1963, went to Langston in the fall of 1963, and  graduated from there in January of 1967. When I went to California, I  went to California State College at Dominguez Hills. I obtained a  master   s degree in special education and learning disabilities. Then, I  came back to Oklahoma, went to OU School of Education, and received  certification for school psychometry, which was the equivalent of  another master   s. So, at least thirty hours above a master   s degree.  Which teachers here in Boley had the biggest influence on you?  As far as majoring in education?  Yes.  Hmm, I don   t know. Dr. Holloway was my high school science teacher.  As far as the elementary schools, I guess it would have to be Mrs. Clark,  who taught second and third grades.  Do you have any other role models and what about them did you admire  most?  I guess they all were basically role models because everybody, during  that time, was parenting and teaching. There was no such thing as  mothers going up and checking on the teachers and this kind of thing. I  guess my biggest role model, probably, was my mother even though she  didn   t finish college and was not a teacher. She is the only one of her  siblings who didn   t go to college. She said she wanted to be married and  have children. (Laughs) Of course, she only had the two of us. But she  was, basically, a stay-at-home mom and made the best teacakes in the  world. (Laughter)  Did you raise your family here in Boley?  I don   t have children.  Okay.  Not any biological children.  6  Finchum  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Finchum  What brought you back to Boley in    76,   77?  Both my parents were still living at that time. My husband   s parents  were in Louisiana and we came back to be closer to them.  How did you chose your profession and what other jobs have you had?  When I went to Langston, at that time, the only thing you could do was  either be a teacher or a secretary or a social worker and I didn   t have any  desire to be a secretary or a social worker, so I majored in education. I  taught in California, then in Sapulpa, and then I came to Boley. After I  came to Boley, I thought,    Well, I don   t want to be in the classroom  forever.    So, that   s when I pursued the certification for psychometry. I  was a psychologist for the State Department of Education for twenty-four  years.  What is your fondest memory of Boley?  Being here, being able to run up and down the street and have fun.  Participating in the school activities, the plays, the programs, we used to  have weekly chapel programs. All kinds of school related activities,  even though we didn   t have basketball. Of course, I have two left feet  when it comes to basketball, but we did have black plays. We put on  plays. At that time, we had what was NHA, New Homemakers of  America, instead of I think it   s Future Homemakers of America now,  and just in general, being able to visit with my friends. I could go to their  houses and be comfortable just as I would at home. Their parents were  always welcoming. So, it was just a fun time and we didn   t have a lot of  crime and those kinds of things, not like we do now.  Well, what was your neighborhood like and who were your neighbors?  Okay, neighborhoods in Boley at that time were a mile or two miles  away. My closest neighbor was a widowed woman that I would go and  visit with and play cards with her. So, she was a fun type of person. She  was a retired home demonstration agent and she had turkeys. She raised  turkeys. We   d have turkey shoots and those kinds of things. She traveled  a lot and she went to Cuba and she brought a little Cuban girl back home  with her who stayed with her for six months. I visited with her and  played with her, taught her how to speak English, and those kinds of  things. But that was the closest neighbor. Of course, at that point, we got  water from her well.  And what was her name?  7  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Lula B. McCain.  What prompted her to go to Cuba?  I don   t know how she got to Cuba. I don   t know but she brought that  little girl back and she stayed, like I said, about six or eight months or  so. Then she had a friend from over there who came and visited. Her  name was Postoria and I really don   t know how she got to Cuba. I mean,  I don   t know why she went. Like I said, she was, I guess, relatively  young when she retired because I don   t remember her working. When I  remember her, she was not working and her husband had died. I guess  she was just an adventurer.  Would you describe the house you lived in?  It was just a three-room house, like most houses back in that era   small  houses, no running water. I remember when we got electricity and gas in  the early    50s, about 1952 or three, somewhere thereabouts.  What can you tell us about other Cooperative Extension agents and  other programs and organizations here in Boley?  You mean currently? What we have now or what we had then?  Both.  We had an active 4-H club and I was active in the 4-H club and what I  mentioned about the NHA. We had two federated clubs, women   s  federated clubs here in town. One of them started a group of the other  women and we were the Young Ladies Industrial Club and we met and  did lots of little school projects. We did work at the public library,  helping to clean it and to get it organized. At that time, the library was  open. It was sponsored and run by the Ladies Industrial Club and that  was part of what we did as the Young Ladies Industrial Club. Oh, there  must have been twelve or fourteen of us, high school age.  Where was the library?  Oh, it   s still in the same location it is now. It   s on Cedar Street, just a  little bit behind the telephone office.  Does the library keep hours?  Not anymore.  Okay.  8  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  After the Ladies Industrial Club disbanded, we don   t have the resources  or financial resources to keep it open now, but hopefully we   re going to  be getting some funds, eventually, to reopen it.  Who makes up the current Boley community and how would you  compare that to the past Boley community?  The community now is based mostly around retired folks like me. We  have youngsters, but they   re either really young or real old. The  community, when I was a child growing up here, there were lots of  people, lots of working class people, who traveled to and from  Oklahoma City, some on a daily basis, to Tinker Air Force Base for  work. A few worked doing domestic work at Okemah, Prague, and those  areas. Of course, the town has dwindled down, so it   s a lot smaller now  than it was then. All the buildings that you see on Main Street that are  vacant now and have vacant lots had buildings and businesses that were  thriving businesses. They were thriving. People made their livelihood in  those stores   the grocery stores, hardware, millinery shop, dry goods  store. Kees Department Store had ready-to-wear clothes. The building is  still standing but after he died and his brother died, we no longer have  that business.  Who were some of the town   s leaders and how were they chosen from  the community?  I think Mr. Lee, Maurice Lee, Sr., I think, was the mayor during the time  I was a child and lived here. They were chosen at that time. They had  wards and each ward had a representative who was on the town board of  trustees to represent them. Of course, now, we have what we call  members at large. Anybody who is a qualified voter and has lived in the  town for six months is capable of running for the town board of trustees  and is elected by the citizens of the town who live within the city limits.  Who are your town   s current leaders?  We have a five-member board. There are five women on the board and  we call them trustees. From those five trustees, a mayor is selected and I  happen to be the mayor. We have Denise Mitchell, Katrina Richardson,  Marshalene Haddock, and Deborah Owens as the trustees.  Has the general age of the leadership changed in Boley as the town   s  age has changed?  Yes, it   s a lot younger. Everybody   s a lot younger.  9  Finchum  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  About when did the town start to change and people migrate out,  roughly?  Early    60s is when a lot of people began to move out for better paying  jobs and that kind of thing. Some of the families had large families to  raise and support and they went where they could make more money.  What did people do for a living as compared to what they do now?  There was lots of farming at that time. People grew lots of peanuts,  cotton, and had crops. But when the boll weevil came through and  destroyed the cotton crops, people began to migrate out and move out.  My own father, who had farmed at one time, went to Oklahoma City to  work doing construction. In a lot of the families, the fathers were  construction workers.  What was the focal point of the town? Was it high school sports? Was it  social organizations?  Well, the only sports that we had were basketball and baseball. They had  a football team, I think, at one time, but that was not very popular.  Everybody liked basketball and they continued to support basketball  until the school closed in 2006. During my day, it was academics,  mostly. We didn   t want to have to do what the common laborer had to  do, working the fields and that kind of thing, so education was stressed,  getting an education and going to school. If not college, going to the tech  schools. They didn   t have as many tech schools then as they do now, but  Okmulgee Tech, which is OSU   s technical, that has been there forever, I  guess, for eons anyway. A lot of the students went there and then some  just went to work wherever they could find a good paying job.  Would you walk us through the town as it was and tell us the decade  you   re describing? What the structures were and the businesses, things  like that, like the Masonic Temple and the banks and things like that?  Okay. I remember the Masonic Temple. I was, oh, maybe nine or ten  years old or so when it burned. In the temple, a funeral home was there.  There was a doctor   s office. We had a doctor and a dentist that were in  the same office. We had another doctor who was just down the street.  The businesses were several grocery stores. There was a co-op grocery  store, which my mother ran for a while, and it was made up of the  merchants of the town. It was called the Co-Op. It was in two different  locations that I remember. Oh, I guess it would have been considered a  dry goods store, where Mrs. Sparks sold fabric and sewing notions.  Mrs. Toole had a dry goods store where she sold dry goods, lots of  10  Finchum  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  cotton stockings and hats. She sold hats in recent years. After she died,  her daughter, who was Mrs. Faren, one of the teachers, sold hats there,  beautiful hats. The first pair of house shoes I remember, my  grandfather   I was the apple of his eye   I led him down the street and  he would tell everybody,    Oh, the police are coming, the police are  coming     because I   d be leading him down the street to buy me  something. He bought me a pair of house shoes at Mrs. Toole   s store.  They were green with a red trim and that has been almost sixty years  ago.  I was just trying to think of the other businesses that were here. Oh, we  had the hardware store and it was in the same location that it   s in now  and they sold everything imaginable in that store. If they didn   t have it,  they   d order it for you. They had some, I guess they called them, honky-tonks.  (Laughs) They had a pool hall and several grocery stores, I  remember.  Movie theater?  Yes, we did have a theater. It had movies on Saturday nights.  Do you have any memories of the Masonic Temple?  Vaguely, vaguely.  Do you have any recollection of any types of functions that may have  happened there? What did they use it for?  They used it for the Grand Lodge, which they have now in Tulsa. But at  that time, all the Eastern Stars of the Masons would come to Boley.  They stayed in people   s homes. You weren   t afraid to let them come in  and stay in your home, but you don   t dare do that now. A lot of them did  stay during the Grand Session, when they had the Grand Lodge. There   s  another lodge that we had some members, some folk who lived here that  were members of that lodge   the Woodsmen, I think that   s what it was  called.  I think I   ve heard of that. Do you have any memories of county fairs or  local major sporting events?  Not county fairs, not here in our area. One of my mother   s brothers was  the county agent at Bristow and they had a county fair in Creek County.  We always went to that every year, but I don   t remember a county fair.  As a part of the 4-H club, they had judging contests, which the boys  participated in. They would be judging animals, mostly hogs, and I think  they might have had some calves, too. We had a good basketball team,  11  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  so we always had a big homecoming and had basketball games on a  weekly basis. We played all the other schools in the area, black schools  in the area, because there were so many at that time.  What were homecoming celebrations like in Boley?  Oh, it was a grand thing. We   d have a parade. All of the classes would  put in what we called floats, which were actually cars that would be  decorated. We had a Homecoming Queen, Miss Boley High School.  Each class, ninth through twelfth grade, would have a representative  from their class. Like I said, we   d have a big parade. After the parade,  there was a homecoming game and after the game, there was always a  big dance in the school auditorium. So, it was really lots of fun. We all  looked forward to Homecoming. We always got something new to wear,  usually, and that kind of thing. It was fun.  Would you talk about the role of the church and the churches throughout  town?  We have lots of churches. They   ve all dwindled down to very few  members now because of Father Time. But at that time, the churches  were full of adults as well as the youngsters. At the Baptist church they  had the BTU, which was the Baptist Training Union. The Methodist  church had something that was the equivalent to the BTU, but I   m not  sure what it   s called. Everybody went to church. All the outlying  communities had a church in their community and a lot of them still  have those churches in their own individual communities.  What kinds of local gatherings and events did you participate in?  Like I said, we had Homecoming. The chamber of commerce had a  banquet and the home economics class at the high school would provide  the food and serve it, which was a part of our home economics three  class. We did all kinds of dinner and desserts. One year, I remember we  had a Baked Alaska, if you know what that is, that the girls made in  home economics class. I was always the one that was the gopher. I went  to the grocery store. At that time, we had a grocery store here that had  everything you would need to have a banquet. I had to keep up with all  the grocery tickets and when they needed something from town, I would  be the one to go for it because I was not a cook. (Laughs) And the  teacher knew that I was not a cook, that I would be in the way more in  the kitchen than I would be a help, so I did the going. That was one of  the highlights of the school year was the Chamber Banquet every year  and being a part of that, learning how to serve and which fork to use and  so forth.  12  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  What are the other community traditions that are still celebrated?  Well, even though we don   t have a school we still did have a  Homecoming in February. They had a basketball game, but it was just  the local children playing each other. Then we had one with the alumni.  A lot of the alumni came back and played against each other. During the  traditional Homecoming, they had an alumni reception in that room  where we   d always have lots of snacks and food and those kinds of  things. We still do that. They did that this year. They did that and have  kept that going. Since our school has closed, some of our traditions like  the prom, graduation activities, those things we no longer do.  Why do you think keeping Homecoming alive is so important to the  community?  So that we don   t forget our past and we don   t forget what it was. We  want to keep it alive so that the youngsters will realize what a rich  tradition they come from.  Would you describe the interactions between Boley and the neighboring  towns like Okemah or Clearview?  Now, they   re good, but when I came along, you didn   t go to   we went  to Okemah to the grocery store if that was what we needed to do, we did  that and left. There were no black kids in Okemah at that time. But now,  all the schools are integrated. We have two women from here who are  teachers in Okemah public schools. Paden had a couple of black teachers  at one time, but they don   t have any anymore. We went to Okemah for  whatever we needed because it was considered a big town compared to  Boley, at that time.  Would you talk a little about the role of the Boys    Home in Boley?  It was a place of good employment for a lot of the people who lived  here. They had the school part of it connected with the public school, so  a few of them, at one time, came from the public school down to the  town school to play on the basketball team and eventually graduated.  But it was mostly a thing of employment. There were a lot of people  who worked there, not only in the educational part of the school, but  they had trades. There was a tailoring shop there, a shoe shop, those  kinds of trades, and the boys went through those trades and learned a lot  of those trades.  How long has the Boys    Home been gone?  It closed in about 1983, I believe. That   s when they changed it over to  13  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthew  Simpson  Matthew  Simpson  Matthews  the Department of Corrections.  How important was church and attending church, to your family?  Very important. My mother was a very big church woman. She worked  in the mission, sang in the choir, and belonged to the same church for  almost eighty years. It wasn   t a thing where she sent us to Sunday school  and church. She took us. My father did too, but he wasn   t as   if he got  there, that was fine, but once he got started going, he was the adult  Sunday school teacher. So, I grew up in the Baptist church. I still go to  the Baptist church.  And you go to church here in Boley?  Yes. I belong to Antioch Baptist Church, which at one time was the  largest Baptist church in the area. Of course, now, the membership has  dwindled down to a precious few, but we still function. We still hold on,  and have Sunday school and church every Sunday.  What traditions or customs were present in your family that you still  preserve?  We preserve it as a part of my family not near as much because like I  said, I   m not a cook, but for Thanksgiving and Christmas, as long as I  can remember, we went to my mother   s oldest brother   s house, Mrs.  Ashley. Mrs. Ashley was a great cook and loved to cook. Thanksgiving  Day dinner was always at her house. When Uncle Bubba came back  from quail hunting, we   d finally have dinner. Then on Christmas, she  started having Christmas breakfast. This was our family thing. We did  that until they all died. Even after they died, Spike would come and do  the cooking and we would still have family breakfast on Christmas  morning.  When our grandma was living, she always invited all the ministers. My  uncle was a superintendent at a Sunday school and they had an early  morning Christmas service and he always showed a movie. After that,  then all the ministers would go to their house for breakfast, which was a  big thing. Even though they   re all gone now, my sister and I still have  Christmas dinner together. Sometimes my cousins come and sometimes  they   re all with their families. But that   s the one thing that we   ve always  done.  What stories have come to you about your parents and grandparents?  Do you want to think about it for a little bit?  Well     14  Finchum  Matthews  Finchum  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Where had the grandparents migrated from?  Louisiana.  So, any stories about that trip or     I don   t remember too much about my grandparents because I was young  when they died. I think I was twelve when my grandfather on my  mother   s side passed away. My grandmother on my mother   s side I  don   t remember because she died in 1937. Then on my father   s side, I  think I was eleven or twelve when my grandfather died. After he died,  my grandmother moved to California. So, I basically didn   t have  grandparents that I was around a whole lot because at twelve you   re not  very old.  My father   s parents ran a store in the community where they lived out of  Chilesville. I can remember going there and being there in the store and  eating spam. And I still love Spam. (Laughs) Every time I eat spam I  think about my grandfather   s store. But after she moved away, we didn   t  have that connection and she was the only grandparent that I basically  was around after ten or eleven or so. I   m trying to think, my grandfather  died in   one died in    57, one died in    58, so I didn   t have grandparents.  I remember my great-grandmother who lived to be ninety-four or five or  something like that, my mother   s grandmother.  What kind of entertainment was here and was it family based or  community based?  A little bit of both. Like I said, there were social clubs, the Mag and  Jake   s, which was an adult club. I think they got together once a month  or something. We had a pokeno group. Yes, pokeno, pokeno, not  pinochle, pokeno. A pokeno club that the women belonged to. There  were some that played canasta, which was a card game. Then there were  the adults, who were similar to the 4-H club, but they worked with the  home demonstration agent. We had that group here. They sponsored  different activities. We had a womanless wedding. Well, we had several,  but the very first one   and I don   t remember exactly who sponsored it,  but it was hilarious.  What is that?  A womanless wedding. Everybody in the wedding was a man.  Oh   15  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  My daddy played the bride. He was six foot five and his husband was  your uncle, Lee Virgil Patterson  Sr. . And you know how tall Lee Virgil  is.  About five-five?  Yes. (Laughter) And all the bridesmaids and everybody was a man  dressed in a woman   s clothes. It was something to see. I remember that.  We had a woman, one of the teachers in one of the outlying  communities, who was a tall, big woman with big feet. She even had  high-heeled shoes that were big enough to fit my dad as a bride.  (Laughter) But there were some others in there, but I remember those  two because they looked like Mutt and Jeff. They had this wedding dress  and the veil and the whole nine yards on my daddy as the bride. It was  sponsored by one of the local clubs. We had two federated women   s  clubs, at that time that I had mentioned, the Self Culture and the Ladies  Industrial Club. The Self Culture club had a tea every year where they  raised funds and most of the scholarships and that kind of thing.  Did you have any special food traditions or craft traditions in your  family?  No, not really. My mother was a great seamstress and I did learn how to  embroidery, how to crochet. I did learn a little bit of basic sewing. I  could follow a basic, simple pattern and did a little bit of everything  except tat. I never tried tatting, but one of my mother   s friends did that. I  crocheted just enough to do a simple doily, those kinds of things. As far  as foods were concerned, my mother was also a very good cook and we  ate lots of homegrown vegetables. At that time, that was before  everybody had a freezer, she canned in an old fashioned pressure cooker.  We still eat some of the same things. She cooked lots of greens, peas,  new potatoes out of the garden, and she called them English peas. My  sister still does that kind of cooking.  Were there particular things that she canned that were really favorites  in your family?  She canned sausage. Everybody would raise their own hogs, did their  own butchering, and she canned sausage and that was always a treat. I  can taste it now  (Laughs) She canned sausage that we always enjoyed  and peas, mostly peas. She didn   t do a whole lot of canning of   well, I  guess she canned some green beans too, but mostly field peas, black-eyed  peas, purple hull peas.  Do you have any special family heirlooms or keepsakes that you still  have in your possession?  16  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  No, I don   t. My sister has them.  Could you describe them and what their history might be?  She has an old fashioned sausage stuffer, which is where you use the  small intestines from the hog and stuff it with sausage and make link  sausage. She has a butter mold that   s a rectangle. Most people had round  butter molds, but this one was rectangular. I don   t know where it came  from. We have her sewing machine, old fashioned treadle sewing  machine, that probably   oh, it   s well over a hundred years old. We have  a table that she told us to always keep where she used to set at the mirror  and press her hair when she was a young woman. She told us to always  keep that so, we have that. We have an iron bed that was my  grandmother   s. When I say we, my sister and I have all these things.  Most of it   s in storage because she told us to keep it. We keep talking to  each other about it and trying to decide what we are going to do with all  this stuff because she only has one child and he   s not going to be  interested in keeping all that stuff so, I don   t know what we   ll do with it.  (Laughs)  Did you save the pressing comb that she used to use, too?  I   m sure we probably have one somewhere. I know we don   t have that  one, but we have one. When I was a child, she had one that had a wick  and you used it with coal oil. Kerosene was the fuel and you   d light it  and put the pressing comb on top of it. After she got older and things  began to change, she modernized and bought a little pressing stove that  you put it in that was electric. Like the beauty shops used to use. I don   t  think too many people  use them now .  Don   t mind me    (Laughter)  You   ve still got a pressing curl, really?  Yes.  I didn   t think anybody wore pressing curls hardly anymore.  I do.  Bless your heart. (Laughter)  Okay. Could you describe a typical family dinner? What were the dishes  on a Sunday afternoon after church?  17  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  If it was this time of year, we   d have mustard greens, probably mashed  potatoes, fried chicken, pork chops, maybe a roast   and cornbread, of  course. There was always milk in the house, always. Buttermilk, my  mother churned and made her own, made butter and then what was left  was the buttermilk. We drank that and if all else failed, when you were  hungry you ate buttermilk and cornbread with lots of sugar in it.  (Laughs) My sister and I were talking about that the other day. We were  just talking about different things and we were talking about the  buttermilk and cornbread. That would be a typical dinner. In the fall of  the year, we   d have probably collard greens and candied yams rather  than the mustard greens. As long as greens were in season, we used to  have greens of some kind.  What were the major world events that impacted you, growing up? Do  you remember the first world event that caught your eye as a child?  First thing that I really got involved in was when John Kennedy ran for  president. What year was it he ran? He ran against Eisenhower.  Anyway     Nixon?  Nixon, no. Stevenson I think. Adlai Stevenson.  Oh.  That was before you all were even born, probably. (Laughs) But we had  some kind of program in school. We were in high school. We did some  kind of program in school. It might have been a chapel program where  all those that were for the democrats were for John Kennedy, then those  that were for the republicans   and had a program with that. I don   t  remember all the details of it now, but it probably was a chapel program  because at that time, we had chapel every week. Different classes would  have a chapel program. The veterans always came over on Veterans Day  and had a big chapel program. They didn   t do that in recent years at all.  Kids were not too in tune to it and learning poetry and that kind of thing.  What do you see as the impact of integration on the town of Boley?  Well, we were the first school to integrate in the county and we were the  first school to have a Head Start program in the county, which was a  good thing for the little children. Like I said, it benefitted the kids and  gave the parents something to look forward to, to help the children with  because they had parent groups and those kinds of things. Naturally,  when the school went out, we lost the Head Start program too, but I  guess the first Head Start program was when they first started it. Mr.  18  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Ashley was very innovative and he didn   t mind going out and getting  whatever he could for the Boley public school system and he did that.  He integrated the faculty, must   ve been in the middle to late    60s when  integration was basically, just starting. It had to be past the middle    60s  because I did not have a teacher who was not black until I was in college  and that was Dr. Sothhower I think or it might have been Dr. Settler.  (Laughs) We didn   t have any white teachers because the school was not  integrated at that time.  How did you learn about the Tulsa Race Riot? Did you learn it in school  or at home?  I didn   t learn about the Tulsa Race Riot until after I was grown and  started reading about it in the paper.  What about Boley   s history was taught at your school?  I don   t remember anything, necessarily, just about Boley being taught.  Before I went to high school they had what they called Negro History,  which was a class, and that was what we were taught. As far as what I  was taught about black folk, we learned just by osmosis it seemed. I  don   t know, because we didn   t have a black history class at that time.  But we learned about it through whatever fields they were in. I can   t  think of his name   George Washington Carver, Carla D. Wilson, and  those people we just learned, I guess, from general information because  there were no classes, particularly, that taught those kinds of things.  What was the town reaction to the assassinations of Martin Luther King  and John F. Kennedy?  Shock and disbelief with Martin Luther King. When John Kennedy was  killed I was in college and, of course, everything was cancelled. We  were supposed to have a chapel program or something was scheduled  and they cancelled it because he had been killed. Martin Luther King,  like I said, it was a shock, just disbelief. Everybody was glued to the TV,  to the black and white TV. (Laughs) If there was anybody here in town  that had a color TV, it might have been one person, but I don   t  remember anybody having one at that time because that was a luxury.  TVs were basically a luxury to start with and then a color TV really  would have been a luxury.  Did the churches do anything?  I don   t remember.  Okay.  19  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  Simpson  Matthews  I don   t remember.  What is it about Boley that keeps the connection alive for its residents?  Pride and tradition. You have the pride of being a part of history because  we were very historical at that time. We had a lot of first things for a  black community. We have had, at one time, our own bottling company.  We had our own electric company, three cotton gins, and two banks. All  these things are things that I   ve learned from history. Now, I do vaguely  remember a cotton gin. As a matter of fact, it was somewhere right along  in here in this area of town across the street. The bottling company I  don   t remember and the ice plant I don   t remember. Just history, pride,  and tradition are things that we   d like for the youngsters to always  remember.  What do you think is the most important thing that people should know  about Boley?  That we don   t give up and that we   re determined. We have integrity. We  get along and even if we don   t get along during the week if somebody  comes in and bothers somebody, we   ll be onto them because we look  after our own. We take care of each other.  How would you like to be remembered?  As having given my all and my best for the town of Boley.  Well, thank you very much for spending part of your afternoon with us.  You   re welcome.  We have enjoyed our time today in Boley, Oklahoma.  Well, good.  -------  -------
