 Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  This is Julie Pearson- Little Thunder. Today is October 19, 2011, and  I   m here with Troy Anderson at his studio in Siloam Springs, Arkansas.  Troy, you   ve been active on the Indian art scene for a long time. It   s  hard to find an Indian art collector who does not have some of your  work. You started off as a painter but later branched out into sculpture,  and you   ve won numerous awards in both media. Thank you for taking  the time to talk with me.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, and my folks lived in Delaware  County of Oklahoma when I was born, so I grew up, basically, in  Delaware County of Oklahoma pretty much all my life. I think I lived in  Arkansas about four months of my first eighteen years of my life.  (Laughs)  Any brothers or sisters?  Yes. I had two brothers and a sister. Actually, my mom   we had two  other sisters that had died within a few months of their birth.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad was pretty much a jack of all trades. He rodeoed, he farmed, he  blacksmithed. He farrowed, shoed horses, ran a backhoe, did cement  work. He worked for the city of Watts for a while in the water  department, so he just kind of did whatever he wanted to. (Laughter)  Just to help support the family. Your Cherokee is on your dad   s side, and  it   s Old Settler. Am I right?  5  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Basically Old Settlers. My first experience, I guess, with my ancestors  was they came to northwest Arkansas in 1832, and then I later found  them in Alabama. Then they moved to Arkansas again, then to Missouri,  and then to Indian Territory.  Was anybody in your family or extended family gifted artistically?  Actually my grandmother took up oil painting when she was probably in  her seventies.  Is that a real memory for you?  A memory for me because most of my family had played music. I   m  always jealous of my brother. He plays guitar. He just picks it up and  starts playing it, so does my mom. I can   t even     Were you drawing at a young age or interested in art?  Yes. I always remember drawing. The first time I really became aware  of it was in the third grade. We were in a two-room school house. Late  in the afternoon there wasn   t much to do, so they   d give us pencil and  paper and say,    Draw something.    I was drawing, and a teacher came up  behind me and complimented me on how good a job I was doing, so I  took that and ran with it. (Laughter)  What about junior high or middle school? Did you have art classes at  all?  Actually, I didn   t take any art. It wasn   t even in my mind, I don   t think. I  remember, about my junior-senior year, after football practice and track  was all over, somebody had bought me a, I think it was, pastel set. I  started doing some pastels, and that   s kind of how I got   then I got a  scholarship to Connors State College and, of course, they say,    You   re  going to major in       and I put down art. (Laughs)  Was it a football scholarship, or was it an athletic scholarship?  It was a football scholarship. That was my first experience with art  classes, was in college.  Who got the pastel set for you? Was it a family member?  It was a girlfriend   s mother. I think it was to keep me busy. (Laughs)  How did your folks feel about you declaring an art major?  6  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Well, my dad was probably   thinking that your son is going to grow up  to be an artist was kind of a shock. It was always interesting. He was  like,    What are you going to do with that?    But then after I became  fairly known for my art, people would come up to him and say,    Are  you Troy Anderson, the artist?    and he would say,    Yes.    (Laughs)  Happy to take the credit.  I learned later that he would actually try to draw a little bit. Later on, I  think he was a little proud, maybe.  And he was a Senior, wasn   t he? Was he Troy, Sr.?  Yes, yes.  So you   re an art major in college. What kinds of things did you learn  that were useful to you later on?  Well, being a child of the late    60s and early    70s in our art school, most  of it was collage. Looking back, I learned a lot about composition,  balance. I think when I look at my work now, it   s kind of a collage. I  think that helped me in some ways. I remember my first figure drawing  class. About a month into it, I thought,    I have got to get out of this  class.    They said,    No, you have to hang in there and work your way  through it.    I thought,    When I get out of this class, I am never going to  do a human figure again.    So what do I do now?  All the time? (Laughs)  All the time.  When you say you think your paintings are collages, in a way, can you  explain that a bit more?  It takes different ideas and different materials and kind of intertwines,  even, thoughts and ideas. Sometimes artists, we have a preconceived  idea of what we   re going to do. I find that when I start, I may start out  with one idea, and then you intertwine something into that, and  something else happens over here, and something else there. Before you  know it, it   s kind of like a stew. You start out with the potato soup, and  it winds up everything   s in the pot. (Laughs)  What was your first experience with Indian art? When did you see your  first Indian painting?  7  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  When I was in college, my freshman year at Connors State, we went to  Five Tribes Museum on a field trip and saw works of Jerome Tiger and  Fred Beaver and Willard Stone. It was just, somebody turned the light  on. One of my favorite people, of course, is Willard. He was always a  delight, and I always loved the way he could take a block of wood and  make something beautiful out of it.  Did you have much interaction with him at shows and things?  Oh yes. Yes. He was very giving. I find that all the artists at that  particular time were very giving of their talents. I had the pleasure of  going to Fred Beaver   s house and seeing his studio and going through it.  He was just gracious, and he   d share anything with you. The same with  Willard. Solomon McCombs was the same way. All the artists, (at that  time I would call them old timers) they were very giving of their talents.  So you went to the Five Tribes Museum while you were in college. Did  you enter any Indian art shows, or did that come later?  That came much, much later. As a matter of fact, it was probably ten  years later.  Did you, in college, start exploring some Indian subject matter, or not  yet?  No, no. The college experience was figure drawing, still lives, just that  old boring stuff, perspective, all the elementary details of art, but you  need that. You need that.  After college, what happened?  When I got out of college, I decided I was going to be a teacher/coach.  Art teacher-slash-coach.  Yes.  That   s a great combination.  Great combination. It made it pretty easy to get a job because most  coaches are math or history or social studies. You get a staff of eight or  ten coaches and all of them are teaching history, it makes it pretty thin,  so as an art teacher it made it much easier to find a place, a niche. I did  that for three years.  In which school system?  8  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  My first year was in Liberal, Kansas, and then I went to a place called  Kermit, Texas, which is around Midland, Odessa area. As I did that, I  would spend a lot of my spare time doing art. After three years of  coaching and dealing with parents, I   d moved twice in three years and  was getting ready to move again. I thought,    This is not stable enough  for me,    so I decided I would move back to Siloam Springs and try to  make it in the art field. When I got back here, first thing, a coach comes  up and says,    Would you like a job?    (Laughter) I said,    No. Been there.  Don   t want to do that.     Did you have a family yet or not?  No.  But you did end up working part time at Allen Canning Company. Is that  right?  Yes, I worked for Allen Canning for eight years.  What did you do for them?  I was in traffic control.  You were also painting on the side?  I was painting on the side, doing arts and crafts shows, mall shows,  anywhere I could go.  And doing Indian art for some of the mall shows?  Yes.  So what were those shows like? Were people interested? Are we talking  early    70s, then?  We   re talking, yes, early    70s. Of course, in that, I would do some  western stuff, too. Because my dad being in the rodeos and always being  around horses, I did some western stuff. It   s Indian-western type stuff.  Then, being from west Texas, I did a few windmills.  A little something for everyone, right?  (Laughs) That   s right, yes, whatever would bring in a buck. If you were  in west Texas, you had to paint windmills, so I did windmills. I admit it.  I confess. I did windmills.  9  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  What were your works priced at, typically, at some of these shows?  Oh, anywhere from three dollars to twenty-five dollars. (Laughter) I  have people that come up to me now and say,    I bought one of your  paintings back in    74. I think I gave five bucks for it.    If I remember it, I  give them their money back, but I haven   t had any takers yet.  What was one of the first galleries that you started working with, as  well, besides doing the mall shows?  I guess the first experience with galleries was in about    76. I had been  taking some stuff to the Five Tribes Museum, and a lady from Phoenix,  Arizona, came through, looking for artists for her gallery in Scottsdale.  They sent her to my house. She said,    We want to do a show for you,  one-man show, and we need x-number of pieces. Can you do that?    Of  course,    Yes, I can do that.    I think it was called the Sun Gallery in  Scottsdale. Did a one-man show. It was a little country boy, going to  Scottsdale, Arizona.  How many pieces did you have?  Oh, I think I had probably twenty-five or so.  How many months to prepare?  I actually was pretty prolific back then. Well, I was younger, so I could  paint   I   d get off work at five o   clock, start painting at six thirty, seven,  and go until four or five in the morning, get a couple hours sleep and go  again, but I don   t do that anymore.  What was that like? Basically, your first gallery show was a one-man  show.  Well, I didn   t think much   thinking back on it, when you   re a young  kid, you don   t think about how not many people get to do that. I sold  more artwork and made more money at that show than I made working  at Allen   s for six months. I thought    Hey, this is the way to go.     How about Indian Paintbrush Gallery? I know you had a pretty close  relationship eventually with the Van Pouckes, who were collectors,  started out as collectors and later opened that gallery. Was that  important to your career?  Moose and Nancy basically sponsored me during that period from  Allen   s until I was able to make it in the art world. They supplemented,  10  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  actually, my income.  Once you quit Allen, which was how many years after you started?  I   m going to say probably two or three years, which was a big help  because in the art business, some days are diamonds and some days are  gravel. I was very fortunate in having them as backers and supporters.  Even their interest in my work went over to some of their friends, so it  was very helpful in my career at that time.  So they were essentially buying art, a certain amount of art, per month?  Yes, and the gallery, she started that quite a bit after that. You   d think,  well, she had all this artwork that she needed to sell, but that wasn   t the  case. She just loved art and wanted to open a gallery. Basically, she  bought artwork from artists and put it in her gallery. I don   t know that  she did a lot of consignment. That   s how supportive she was of the  artists. She would buy. Of course, she bought at wholesale prices, yet  she didn   t have to do that. She realized the importance of the need to  support the arts. She, actually, I think, helped a lot of artists when they  needed it.  Did you experiment with flat style at all,    traditional style,    when you  started painting Indian subject matter?  Yes. Of course, when you see Fred Beaver and you see Solomon  McCombs, the master artists at that particular time, Terri Saul,  it   s flat. That   s what Indian art was. What I tried to do was, I kept it flat  but I tried to take it to another level. Like with a face, you have one  facial tone, and what I wanted to do was to break up the tones of the  face. I would have three tones or four tones, so that you got a little more  3-D effect. That   s how I handled my work was trying to get more  dimensional but not blended but flat.  Were you pairing portraits with bird or animal imagery yet?  You have to do that with Native art. The legends, the stories, animals are  involved. One of the things I think I tried to do was involve animals and  nature more into the Native...  With elements of landscape, trees, or     Yes.  What was the first award you remember winning?  11  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Probably First  Place  at the Five Tribes competitive show. I think in my  early years, one of the shows we did was the Heard Museum. I think you  were able to enter two or three pieces, and they sold. We actually went  to the opening. I don   t know whether I was just young and naive, but  looking back on it, it   s   I don   t know if they still do that kind of show  anymore. I know we went to Denver once. It was an all-Native show. It  was a big deal.  Big receptions.  Big receptions. Name people were there. For a young kid from the  sticks, it was pretty exciting.  Exciting experience. Did you do pretty well at the Heard? Did you win  any awards at the Heard?  Yes. Won First. That   s always exciting.  Did you get any business tips from some of the older artists?  No, we didn   t really talk about business. It was more about, maybe,  techniques or how they saw things. Willard, we were in his studio. He  had this pile of wood outside of his studio. I thought,    Why do you got it  stacked out there? Why don   t you have it put away in a safe place?    He  says,    Well, every day I walk by that piece of wood, and one of these  days it   s going to speak to me, and I   m going to bring it in.    He always  told me,    It   s in there, and all I   ve got to do is carve away what   s not  part of the image that   s in there.    He says,    Until it speaks to me, it stays  outside.    (Laughter) After I thought about that, I thought,    Well, if you  had to sit outside all day, you   d eventually want to say something.     (Laughter) It makes sense.  Would you visit him when you were on route someplace else?  Yes. Of course, I knew Jason. You go and do shows. As well known as  Willard was and as popular as he was, it wasn   t uncommon to find him  at Grove under a tree with a tent, or in a small gallery with three or four  pieces, maybe ten-thousand-dollar piece, sitting in a little gift shop.  (Laughs)  Wow, just visiting, in a gift shop?  Yes.  How about the Indian art landscape in the    80s? How did it change from  the    70s to the    80s?  12  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Well, during the late    70s and early    80s it became very popular. I think  like with anything that becomes popular and there   s money in it, people  want to get   it   s like the Gold Rush. Nobody cared anything about  California or Arizona or Nevada until the gold and silver was there, and  then everybody went there. I never thought about it until now, but it   s  probably true that the ones that discovered it made a little money, and  the ones that came in later didn   t make it. You know what I   m saying? It  was all panned out, so to speak. (Laughter) I don   t know. It was an  interesting time. It was an exciting time. I always thought that it would  come back, but I   m not so sure now. I   m not so sure.  Did you do the Philbrook Annual at all?  Yes, those were exciting shows.  The last year was    79, right?  Yes.  There was a lot of experimenting, stylistically, on the part of painters in  the    80s. I think you sort of ventured into a more expressionistic  approach, or was that later that you were doing that?  Yes. It was probably a little later than that. When you say experimental,  again, the flat style, I wandered out of that style fairly soon. And then,  with a lot of the stories and legends, you can tell a story the same way all  the time, or you can put a bit of a twist to it and try to make it a little  more exciting. That   s what I try to do with my paintings. It   s like  Willard. He always had a story to go along with the piece that he was  working on or that he completed, and I loved this.  Sometimes the stories are more exciting than the actual piece. It   s hard  to believe, but you see a squirrel carved out of wood, and you think,     Well, it   s a squirrel carved out of wood,    but it   s not really because it  has more. It has a story behind it. I think the more I got into that, I  wanted my paintings to be more than just a visual thing. I wanted it to  have a deeper meaning. I think that   s what makes Indian art. It   s more  than just a visual thing. It   s a story.  Were you drawing specifically on Cherokee stories at that time?  No, if it was of interest to me   later on, I heard people say,    You  shouldn   t be doing Apache. You   re not Apache.    Well, I shouldn   t be  painting birds because I   m not a bird, and I shouldn   t be painting grass  because I   m not grass. That didn   t make sense to me. If it   s of interest  13  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  and you can put a different twist to it or a different perspective, I don   t  see anything wrong with that.  When did you begin trying your hand at sculpture?  Well, let   s see. I had always loved sculpting from a young age. Of  course, when you   re around Willard   s work, if you don   t get interested  in sculpting when you   re around Willard Stone, you probably never will.  Just being around him, being around his work   to this day, I don   t see  how the man could take a block of wood and sculpt a face out of a block  of wood and have the grain of the wood go where it goes.  I also believe that until you can experience what that artist has done, you  shouldn   t criticize or you shouldn   t judge. It   s the old adage: until you  walked in my shoes, don   t judge. I   ve tried stone sculpting. I   ve tried  wood sculpting, metal. To me, the hardest would be the wood and how  he could get those things. I would be using a lot of glue. Elmer   s Glue  would be my best friend.  When you first tackled sculpture, you started immediately with bronzes.  Is that right?  Yes, pretty much.  How do you think your sculptural style has changed over the years?  I once had an artist friend tell me that I sculpt like I paint, so it   s a  collage, basically. When I do sculpt, a lot of times it is a lot of different  elements in one piece. Again, it depends on how you want to tell the  story. If the story is one-dimensional, you wind up with one-dimensional  artwork. If your story is two-dimensional or three-dimensional, then you  have to have that in your work, so that   s what I try to do.  I remember that you met your wife Gail during the    80s. She was  working at a bank, kind of the opposite spectrum from art. What drew  you together?  I had just recently divorced, and she was working at a bank where I had  my banking account. I had a friend that was president of the bank, and I  would go and see him. I   d see her walk across the lobby. Often times, I  would forget what my balance was at the bank, so I would have to call  the bank to get my balance. That   s pretty much how that all started.  What role has she played in your art business over the years?  Oh, it   s hard to describe. She   s my best friend. She   s always looking out  14  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  for me. She always knows what my bank account is. (Laughter) No. She  just   there   s nobody better. I   m very lucky to have her.  And you did travel to shows together, I know, for a number of years.  Yes, we went everywhere. We   ve been just everywhere you can  imagine. She   s been there right with me.  What was one of your more memorable art show travel adventures?  Art shows? I don   t know if I should tell it or not. We were doing a show  in Santa Fe, I think, and it was at Ted Miller   s. We were at the hotel  getting ready to go to the opening. Miranda, she was a toddler, running  around. Gail always had her dressed to the nines with her curly blonde  hair. I think we were even in tuxes, if I   m not mistaken. It was real  fancy. We get to the show, and we   re meeting and greeting and talking  to people. I don   t know if I should tell this or not. (Laughs) Miranda is  playing around, and all of a sudden Gail goes, (gasps). I say,    What   s  wrong?       I forgot to put Miranda   s panties on     (Laughter) So we have  a little girl that   s going around bare-bottom at the art show. (Laughter)  Everybody got fully dressed but her. (Laughter) You   ve had a number of  commissions, I saw, to design medallions, various commemorative  medallions. What   s one that you especially enjoyed doing and why?  Oh, I enjoy all of them. They   re all different challenges. I guess the one  for the Red Earth Ambassador of the Year has probably been the most  exciting because of the people it   s gone to.  Can you explain a bit about the award?  Red Earth gives the Ambassador of the Year to someone that has  contributed to Native American furtherance of the culture or just to bring  it to the foreground. I think the first or second year, right after Dances  with Wolves came out, they gave it to Kevin Costner. It   s been a lot of  celebrities and dignitaries that have received it, and you get to meet  those people. It   s pretty exciting to know they have a piece of your  sculpturing. They don   t have a choice. It   s not like they bought it,  (Laughs) but they have it.  That is exciting. What   s a sculpture award that you   re especially proud  of, a show award?  You mean as far as an individual piece? I did a piece called The Healer.  That   s probably the one I   m most proud of. It   s just the story. It   s a  collage, and it has different elements. Looking at it, you don   t really   I  15  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  think, visually, if you just look at it, you know that it   s a piece of  artwork, but when you hear the story about it, it   s something totally  different. The elements that are in it, most people don   t even realize that  it   s throughout our culture.  I often ask people,    Do you know where these symbols came from?     People even that work for those particular businesses   medicine, the  symbol for medicine is a pole with a snake going up it. Most people  have no idea, probably a few doctors do, why that is their emblem, or  EMTs. Anything that has to do with medicine has that symbol. Most  people that work in those industries don   t know what they   re looking at.  It   s interesting.  I hope we get to see that piece. You   re one of the few artists I know who  pretty much built their own house, and you built it out in the country.  Why was that important for you to have a studio out here?  Well, I first had a studio that was public. When you have a public studio,  you have a lot of visitors. Those visitors don   t always understand that  it   s work. I don   t have any difficulty with working and having people  watch me work, but sometimes you feel guilty, not being entertaining.  Because of that, I just felt like I needed more seclusion and more  inaccessibility.  In 1990 the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed, which required  Indian artists to provide proof of Indian identity or a letter of  certification from their tribes. Do you remember how that impacted  galleries and Indian artists at that time?  Yes. I actually remember the first time I think I had talked to somebody  about it was Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and this was before he was  senator. I   ve known Ben for many years, done shows with him and  traded with him, so he was familiar with me, and I was familiar with  him. When I heard about the act, I actually called him. I asked him, I  says,    What   s the deal here? What is this?    He says,    You don   t have a  thing to worry about.    If I don   t have a thing to worry about, I   m not  going to worry about it, so I didn   t worry about it. Then all of a sudden,  everything just starts because I   m not a member of the Cherokee Nation  of Oklahoma. I have in past years been   I   ve done things for them  without charge. I have supported them, so I saw no problem with them  or any of the other tribes.  A lot of my friends at that time   sometimes I think you find out who  your friends are when things are going not the way you want them to. In  some ways, the Arts and Craft Act helped me in that I found out who my  friends were. In some ways it hurt because I found out who my friends  16  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  were and weren   t. It   s kind of like a double-edged sword.  During the whole thing, I always figured    I ams what I am,    like Popeye  the Sailor Man. I   ve tried to stay strong in knowing who I am and what I  am. Always tried to be truthful about that aspect. I   ve never claimed to  be somebody I   m not. What else can one do? There   s been times when  I   ve thought,    Well, just don   t paint Indian anymore,    but when it is  what you are, you can   t stop being what you are. It   s like breathing air.  You can   t stop breathing, or you   re dead. So when I   m dead, I won   t be  an Indian artist anymore. (Laughs)  You have a website now, and I   m wondering how that   s changed the  marketing of some of your work or the business part of your artwork.  I have never done much online as far as selling work, but I find it a way  where people can contact me and call me. I probably could use it better  than I do, but you either paint or you work on your website, so I paint.  I understand your youngest daughter, Courtney, is helping you with  sculpture.  Yes. She   s been a great asset as far as the last couple of years. She   s  been working on a project with me, and she   s learned to do things in the  sculpting area. One of the things that she does is she   s my quality  control person. When you   re doing multiple pieces as an artist, we don   t  want to be doing the same thing all the time, so we make little alterations  so that they   re not all the same. When you   re selling multiples, they   re  supposed to all be the same, so she checks me out. Sometimes I   ll have  something maybe turned a little bit different. She corrects it. Maybe I   ll  forget to put something on, leave a feather off or something. She   ll say,     Hey, Dad, this one doesn   t have a feather,    so I have to go back and put  feathers on. It   s good.  Is she doing some of her own sculpture?  She   s going to. She hasn   t yet. I   ve kept her too busy. She wants to do  some of her own. She   s very artistic.  She   s getting some good training. You paint mainly with acrylics. Have  you experimented with other media at all?  Yes. I   ve done oil, watercolor, pastel. I love pencil. A lot of the things  I   ve done recently have been pencil. It   s one of the first arts, but it   s like  nobody does it anymore.  Right, very challenging. How about talking about portraits, which are  17  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  an important format for you. What attracts you to portraits?  I think the character of people, the differences. No two people are the  same, and yet we all have the same elements. Trying to position those  has always been a challenge. It is a challenge, especially if you   re doing  a portrait of somebody that   s known, to make that person look like the  person that they   re supposed to look like.  I once did an oil painting of Mr.  Earl  Allen of Allen Canning  Company, an oil painting for the lobby of the bank, and it   s a very  traditional portrait. You   re doing it for family that knows the person, so  you have to get all the shadows and all the blemishes and everything just  right, or it doesn   t look like that person. I enjoy the eyes of people. The  heart or the soul of people is seen through the eyes. That   s always, to  me, the challenge, is to get people to look at the eyes.  You   ve been quoted as saying you thought Indian artists were getting  away from flat-style    traditional    painting, and you felt it was kind of a  shame because it is a difficult style to do. Can you explain what   s  difficult about it?  I think it   s time consuming. It is not like you just take a brush and go  like that. You have to be very precise. You have to be very considerate  of the tones of the painting. You can   t have one side be light and one  side be dark. It has to be flat. It   s time consuming, and sometimes artists  aren   t willing to sit there to do that. Ben Harjo, to me, is probably about  the only one that still paints traditional. When you see his work, first  thing you have to ask,    Why? Why would you want to spend all that  time painting little squares?    (Laughter) I think that   s what young artists,  when they see that,    You   re taking two or three days to do something  that I don   t want to spend over thirty minutes doing,    but yet they want  to get the same money for their forty-five minutes as he gets for two or  three days. It   s kind of sad, but it   s true.  Right, it has that special effect that you can   t get any other way. We  talked about story being important to your work. How about the kinds of  research that you do for your paintings?  I used to do more research than I do now. Of course, you retain a lot of  the stuff that you learned before, and I think talking with people you find  out a lot of things. We were talking earlier about making sure that your  stories are accurate and that your legends are true. I   ve talked to people  in the Eastern Band  of Cherokee Indians  who tell stories of one way,  and you come west, and it   s another. So I have decided or learned that  sometimes telling the story is all about your perspective.  18  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  It   s like when there   s a wreck. Everybody gets out of their vehicles, and  everybody   s got their own story of the wreck. There   s only one wreck,  but every person has their own version of what happened. That   s the  way it is in art. We can all paint, but our interpretation of the situation is  all personal. Now, you have to be painting the same accident, but we all  see it differently.  Do you do a lot of preliminary sketching when you paint?  Not really. Matter of fact, I usually have a concept in my head of what  I   m wanting to do, but often times that evolves as I   m producing. I may  start out with one idea and then change colors. Or you may add  something that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn   t. When it  doesn   t, you cry a lot. You want to be the best you can be, and often  times when you   re making an unknown move or an attempt to do  something, it   s scary. You can actually ruin days of work in a moment of  insanity. (Laughter) When you get there and you do it, you   re like,    This  was crazy to try this.    (Laughter)  When you   re doing figurative work, whether it   s in painting or  sculpture, have you ever used a model?  Yes. I did a sculpture called Tracker   s Nightmare. It has to do with the  Indians when they first came upon the railroad tracks. What were they  thinking? It   s something they   ve never seen before. It must   ve been, to  their minds,    What is this? Where did it come from? What   s it do?     There   s so many questions. It would be like us seeing a spaceship.  There   s four Indians on the railroad tracks, and each one of them is in  different positions and different poses.  In order to determine that proportion, because you don   t want to have  big Indians on little tracks and you don   t want to have big tracks and  little Indians, you have to get all that in the right proportions. So my  wife and I, we went down to the local railroad tracks, and I posed in that  position, and she would take pictures of me from different angles for all  four Indians. Each of those figures I posed for, she took pictures of. We  did it on the tracks so the proportions of people to tracks would be  correct.  I wanted to go back to this notion that you sometimes have to     Courtney   s been helping you make sure that these sculptures in a series  are all basically alike. When you   re doing a bronze, you   re working  from a mold, a wax mold, right? I would think they would be all the  same.  Well, it   s always your hope, but it doesn   t always happen. There   s a lot  19  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  of factors that are involved. Sometimes it can be even the weather. If it   s  cold, your wax will harden faster. If it   s in the summertime, it doesn   t  harden as fast. Sometimes the wax is not the same tolerance. It   s stickier  one day, and the next day it   s like paraffin. There   s a lot of different  variations.  Sometimes you can have your two-piece mold can slip maybe a  hundredth of an inch, but yet it changes the seam, so the seam   s off a  little bit. In order to get the piece back to where it   s got to be and needs  to be, you have to scrape the seam down. When you scrape that down, it  alters different aspects of it. Sometimes there can be an air bubble in  there, so when you pull it apart, you   ve got bubbles. You have to fix  those, and when you fix it, it   s different from the ones that didn   t have  bubbles.  This last project, an interesting thing happened. I do latex molds. I did  the same figure with two different molds. When I   d pour wax in one  mold, a different texture of wax comes out of it. I can pour the same wax  in the other mold, and it   s different. I don   t know why, but I wish I did  know why.  So are you having to chose which     No, I use both of them, but it   s just a matter of thinking,    Why is this  one so much better than this one when they   re done the same?     How big are your editions of sculptures, typically?  Typically, my editions are twenty-five, but I do larger and smaller. If  you ask me to go out and tell you what the edition was, I can pretty  much tell you it   s twenty-five.  How do you divide your time between painting and sculpture these  days?  If the sculpting is selling, I   m doing sculpting. I   m kidding. No, I   m not.  (Laughs) Usually, it does depend on the money end of it, but it also  depends on deadlines. If I   m coming up for a competitive show and I  need paintings, then I   m going to paint. If I   m coming up on a deadline  to have a bronze done, then I   m going to do that. You get up in the  morning, and it   s like    I   ve got to this get this done, and I   ve got to get  this done.    Which one do you do? Some days you get up and say,    I can  do this, or I can do that, and I   m not going to do either one.    (Laughter)  What   s your creative process, starting with how you get your ideas?  20  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Sometimes the idea is the fascinating part because sometimes the idea is  just like, you see these cartoons where the light bulb comes on, and you  wonder,    How did that light bulb get there?    That   s kind of how your  ideas are. They just pop up. Sometimes you can read a legend or a story,  and it   s just,    This is what I want to do.    In my younger years, you could  be walking out through the woods, and you might have a bunch of Blue  Jays.    Today, I   m doing Blue Jays.    You did whatever nature brought  before you. If it snowed, you walk out in the snow and say,    Well, I  know how people on the Trail of Tears felt,    so you want to express that.  Looking back over your career so far, what has been an important fork  in the road for you?  I guess going full time would probably be one of the major things.  Getting the age that I am, it   s like retirement. I see people that I went to  school with, people not in the art business but they   re retiring, and you  think,    Will you ever retire?    I don   t think artists ever retire. They may  not be as active as they were, and they may not be as prolific as they  were, but I don   t think artists ever retire. I think it   s something that you  eat, sleep, and breathe, good or bad. (Laughs)  When you look back on your career, what has been one of the highlights  so far?  There   s a lot of highlights. I guess just knowing that people appreciate  your work because they don   t have to. I often times will get phone calls  from people from out of the blue. They   ll say    I bought this back in    78  at Santa Fe Market, and it   s hung on my wall all these years,    and they  just have appreciated it. It   s amazing to me how you can do something  that makes you happy and it makes somebody else happy.  How about a low point in your career?  Oh, boy. Probably the low point has been the Arts and Craft deal, and  finding people that you thought were for you weren   t for you, people  you believed in. Like I said earlier, sometimes it seems like a low point,  but it   s all in how you look at it.  Is there anything we   ve forgotten to talk about before we take a look at  your paintings, any subjects we haven   t covered?  The one thing, looking back on my life, is how God has played a role in  the different roads that I   ve gone down, as a little snot-nosed kid playing  in the streets and then wind up standing in front of the President of the  United States or people you never thought you   d even get close to but be  introduced to. Having all those things happen to you and there   s no  21  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  rhyme or reason for that to happen except God has placed you in certain  places and certain times.  I   ll never forget I was in a show in San Dimas, California, and we had an  auction. You may or may not know who Merlin Olsen was or is, but he  was an actor on Little House on the Prairie and a football player, did a  lot of TV stuff, commercials and so on. Anyway, we   re having this  auction, and my painting comes up, and it   s selling for more than it ever  should   ve. The guy that bought it was Merlin Olsen. He came over and  introduced himself, chit-chatted, and then he left. One of my artist  friends came over, and he says,    You know, he walked up, he bid on  your piece, that   s all he bought, and he left.    I thought,    How great is  that? How strange is that?    It just makes you drop your mouth and stand  in awe.  I have to ask for one more story before we look at the art. Which  president were you introduced to?  Bill Clinton.  In conjunction with a painting or a medallion, or     Well, the State of Arkansas gave me an award, I guess, and it was cool.  Very. Okay, we will take a look at your artwork. We   re looking at one of  your sculptures. What   s the name of this one?  It   s called The Healer. It   s a Cherokee medicine man, and on the back  side you can see the feathers. It   s got a Cherokee eagle wand, and the  hands are healing hands. A medicine man, they work with hands. All  medical professions have to use their hands to work with medicine.  Those are actually my own hands that I cast, so that   s kind of interesting,  that I used my own hands. These gorgets, the designs, are serpents or  rattlesnakes, and they   re attached to the pole, or the stick, on the back. A  lot of times, people think of snakes and serpents as being bad things, but  it   s not in all cultures.  One of the things I ask people about is the fact that all the medical  professions have a serpent wrapped around a pole. You would think,     Why would that have anything to do with the medical profession?  Where did that come from?    When you look in the Bible in the book of  Exodus, there   s a story of the Israelites going through the desert, and  they are cursed by snakes. The snakes bite the people, and a lot of them  get sick and die. There   s a great concern, so God tells Moses if he will  sculpt a serpent out of bronze and put it on a pole, and if they look upon  the serpent, they   ll be healed and be cured from the bites of the serpent.  22  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  Anderson  It has to do with faith. They didn   t have to touch it. They didn   t have to  do anything but look upon it, and they would be healed. They could be  hundreds of yards from it, or they could be ten feet from it. It didn   t  matter. All they had to do was look. So that   s why, in most medical  professions, the serpent with the pole comes from the book of the Bible.  You can really see those collage elements in this one. How about this  piece?  This is a piece I   m working on right now. I really haven   t titled it yet.  It   s still not finished, but it has to do with the Cherokee legend of the  hawk and Uktena. Uktena was a mythical serpent creature, kind of a  dragon-type figure. You can see I   m working on that over there in the  foreground. The main concept behind the story is the battle between  good and evil, how man has had to battle between the two. It tells of two  great hawks that had a nest in a cave, and they had their young that they  were rearing inside of the cave. The people were concerned about that.  The hawks were raising their young in this cave, so they decided they  wanted to get rid of this danger. They sent a medicine man into the top  of the cave, and they proceeded to have him swing back and forth until  he was able to drop inside the cave. He was able to get inside, get the  young birds, and push them out of the cave. When they fell from the  cave, they fell into the water where the Uktena was, and then the Uktena  proceeded to devour the young hawks. When the hawks came back, they  decided that the Uktena had came and stolen their young, so they flew  around and came down and grabbed the Uktena and pulled him up into  the air and proceeded to tear him into pieces.  As he fell from the sky, the pieces of Uktena fell from the sky, it made  great indentions in the earth. That   s why we have, I guess you would call  them, meteor indentions and such in the earth. Supposedly, it   s a real  place where the cave is.  Is it in North Carolina?  I believe it   s in Tennessee.  Do you want to talk about this painting?  This is an owl painting that I did. It   s interesting that a lot of Indian  cultures have legends or myths about owls. Some cultures find them  acceptable, and some find them highly unacceptable. When I did this  piece, I had some artists that found it unacceptable, but one of the things  is unless people are made aware of these different superstitions or  23  Little Thunder  Anderson  Little Thunder  different beliefs, then how can people be made aware of it if they don   t  know? In Cherokee culture the owl is considered witchcraft or bad  medicine. It   s interesting.  I was watching, I don   t remember exactly what it was, it was a program,  and the person that was in this particular program was a Native  American, but in his hat he had an owl feather. You might say,    Well,  how did you know it was an owl feather?    If you   ve been around owls,  you know which are owl feathers and which are not. Usually the owl  deals with   you have good and evil. They each have their own  symbolism, so if you see somebody wearing an owl feather, you know  that they   re not afraid of it, so they must be accepting of it. If they are  accepting of it, you might take that as a warning sign that you don   t want  to mess with that person. So therefore it   s kind of an identification.  Now, if you   re not familiar with that aspect of the culture, you might be  accepting of it if you   re of another tribe, not knowing that you are  dealing with something you shouldn   t be dealing with, but the only way  you can know that is to know different cultures. I have been criticized at  times for painting different cultures, but unless you are made aware of  it     I was watching a program today. It was talking about body language.  If you get in somebody   s face and start talking to them, in American  society, that means you   re getting ready to fight or you   re angry with  somebody, but in Middle Eastern countries, that   s the way you talk to  people. If you don   t do that, then you   re insulting them. You have to  know who you   re talking to, and you have to know what   s appropriate  and what   s not, but unless you   re aware of it, you don   t know. You have  to be accepting. If there   s a culture that accepts the owl, you have to  know that. If you   re afraid of it and you   re in their culture, you   ve  insulted them. If you don   t know that they accept the owl, are you just  going to walk in an insult somebody? I would hope not. Now, if you do  it intentionally, then shame on you. (Laughs)  It illustrates the expressionistic, the splashes of color. It   s definitely one  of the styles that you   re known for.  It was interesting when I did this. The week that I finished it, there was a  story in the local newspaper that came out that a barn owl had been  nesting in a Lowe   s store. Rather than get rid of it, they left it in the store  because it had two babies and it was getting rid of the mice in the store.  So the good Lord made owls for a reason.  Thank you so much for your time today, Troy.  24  Anderson You   re welcome.  -------  -------
