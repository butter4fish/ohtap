 Finchum  Lewis  Today is February 15, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re beginning an oral history  project focused on home demonstration agents  Women Agricultural  Extension Educators . We   re here today in Stillwater to speak with Betty  Lewis who got her start back in 1944, in home demonstration. Thank  you for having me today. Let   s start by having you tell a little bit about  your childhood, where you were born, and then we   ll work our way  forward.  I was born in Chickasha, Grady County,  Oklahoma . My folks lived on  a farm six miles west of Chickasha. US Highway 62 went right by our  house. We were among the lucky ones, I guess, because we had  electricity before I was born in 1920. We had a lot of other  conveniences. We had a dairy farm. My dad started a dairy in self  defense, he said, because we drank so much milk. We would take a  three-gallon bucket of milk to the house every night and every morning.  We had a Grade-A Holstein dairy, and sold milk. I milked cows from the  time I was twelve years on, in the morning at five, and in the evening at  five, so we had to rush home from school to do that. Then our other class  work or home studies, 4-H club and things like that, had to come in  between.  So you had to get up pretty early to milk before you went to school?  Oh, my dad said there wasn   t any use in anybody sleeping after five  o   clock in the morning. (Laughter)  How would you get to school?  Walked three-fourths of a mile from our house to the section line west of  us, and then we rode a school bus into town. We were barely within the  limits of qualifying to ride. If we   d have been half a mile closer, we  5  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  couldn   t have ridden on the school bus because you had to live more  than two and a half miles away. Otherwise, you were supposed to walk.  How many students would be in your class, just your age group?  Well, the Verden school was a consolidated school and there were  always, I would say, around forty in our class. When I got to the ninth  grade, there were ninety-some. I think there were forty-four in one class  and forty-five, maybe, in the other class, but many dropped out before  graduation. A lot of kids married early. That was a consolidated school  and the grade school was a three-story building with a gymnasium in the  bottom and restrooms in the basement, and then there was first, second,  third and fourth grade on the first floor, and then fifth, sixth, seventh and  eighth grade upstairs. Then, the high school was across the road, south  from that. That was where I graduated from high school.  And what year was that?  Thirty-seven  1937 .  So, as the Depression was kind of finishing up.  I didn   t know there was a depression. (Laughter) I was living during the  Depression from 1928 on. Through those years, I was in grade school  and high school, and I did hear about the banks closing because my  mother and dad had been saving money and they had lost about five  years of savings that they had in the bank. We were living on the farm  and growing our own meat and vegetables and eggs, things like that, and  then had the dairy on top of that to earn our spending money. The dust  storms were during that time, too. I remember thinking we had to dust  the dust out of the windows and it was granular and tan on the window  sills, and that was a Saturday job that we had every week. I remember  doing that, but I don   t remember it being so bad or anything like that,  more than like now we have a foggy morning every now and then. We  had a foggy afternoon  then , and it was dust. (Laughter)  How early did you begin to cook?  I started cooking probably when I was about five years old because my  mother went back to teaching. She was teaching at Poteau, Oklahoma,  and I was still living on the farm there west of Chickasha. I was living  with my grandmother Woods. I worked with her all the time and she just  gave me jobs to do and I remember sitting in the floor peeling potatoes  and it seemed to me like it was a mountain of potatoes (laughs) that I  had to peel. We didn   t have the peelers we have now. You just used a  regular knife. I remember making biscuits and that was when they put  6  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  the flour in a big wooden bowl and then in the middle of that, they   d  sprinkle some baking powder or soda and salt and some shortening,  milk, and then you worked it up with your hands until it was crumby like  corn meal, and then you added your liquid to it and just worked it until it  was a real soft dough. You didn   t try to get all the flour in, and they   d  just put that wooden bowl of flour back in the pantry, then, and start  biscuits in it again the next day. That was the way I learned to make  biscuits.  And you cooked those in a wood stove?  Yes. Like I said, we had electricity, and not everybody did. I, probably,  was about ten or eleven years old when we got an electric stove, so we  used a wood stove because it heated the kitchen, and it had a big water  reservoir on one end of it so we always had plenty of hot water in the  kitchen. Then we had a kerosene stove that we used in the summer,  because it didn   t put off as much heat and it kept the kitchen cooler. Our  kitchen was just a big square room. It was about sixteen, almost square,  sixteen by eighteen feet square.  How did you get interested in home economics as a career?  Well, I guess I didn   t really know when I did because I loved to work  with my grandmother and I had lived with her ever since I could  remember. I was away for about a year and a half when my mother and  dad were in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Missouri. He worked for the  Chautauqua Education Company and she was teaching. Then we came  back for Christmas in    26, and they just said Christmas, they didn   t tell  us they were moving back. My grandfather wasn   t able to take care of  everything on the farm, and so we lived with my grandparents there for a  time until they moved in to Chickasha. Then we lived in that house until  I graduated from high school there, six miles west of Chickasha.  Did you have home ec in high school?  Yes, I had home ec and my home ec teacher was Bonnie Bell Butler that  later taught home economics at OCW, Oklahoma College for Women at  Chickasha. She was there the last year that I was at home. I took home  economics when I was a freshman in ninth grade and each year, so I had  four years in high school. I knew that I liked it and I had learned to cook  and do housework and things like that, living with my grandmother and  working alongside of her. I went to Chickasha to OCW the first two  years, and I got a catalog from OU because the rest of my family had  gone to OU. Then I   d heard about Oklahoma A M, so I got a catalog  from up here. One of my high school home ec teachers had been to  school up here, and I compared the requirements. In the other schools,  7  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  there was a lot more history and foreign languages, euthenics, and art  than there was up here. In the catalog for A M, there was drapery  making and furniture refinishing and tailoring and things like that that  were not listed as requirements in home economics in the other catalogs.  So, in the summer of    39, I got a job in Murray Hall and it was new that  year. I worked in the dining hall and I earned twenty-five cents an hour.  A lot of money, then, huh? (Laughter)  But that paid for my room and part of my board.  Then you enrolled in     And I enrolled in home economics.  And graduated in?  There were so many hours of foreign language and other subjects that I  had to take the two years I had gone to Chickasha. With my practice  teaching, it took me five years to finish college, so I graduated in    42 up  here. I had a life teaching certificate in science and a vocational home  economics certificate. I taught six weeks in junior high here in  Stillwater, and then I taught senior high biology in Stillwater, and then I  went to McAlester and taught six weeks in home economics. That was  almost a year. There wasn   t time for much other class work. So, that   s  why it took me five years to finish.  We had a placement bureau here then. The seniors filled out forms of  their qualifications. There was a fellow from down at Tryon named Joe  Peek and he had read my transcript and qualifications. He called me and  asked if I would come to Welch, Oklahoma to teach. So, that   s where I  taught the first year. After I had accepted that job, my high school  superintendent, Dr. Jesse Owensby called and he wanted me to come  teach at Lindsay where he was superintendent. So, after I taught at  Welch, then I taught at Lindsay two years.  There were two extension people, Gladys Stiles and Emma Chandler,  that kept coming by my home ec room just before four o   clock and  they   d stay and visit after school for an hour. And I thought those ladies  just didn   t have very much to do. They had a lot of time to visit.  (Laughs) Then, before school was out that year, Miss Chandler asked me  what I was going to do and I said I was going to start on my graduate  work up here at Stillwater. She said,    I have an apartment in my house,  and I won   t be home very much and I need somebody to stay in my  house.    So I stayed at Emma Chandler   s house at 617 South Duck that  summer, and one of the seniors that was graduating from Lindsay High  8  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  School, Mary Ellen Faulk. I had roomed with her mother and dad at their  home on Choctaw Avenue in Lindsay. She came and roomed with me.  She was a freshman and I was a graduate student that year. That   s when  I started my graduate work. I worked full time and went to school on  educational leave, and I think I finished eighteen hours then. Then the  war was over and the fellow that I had dated for many years had been  gone three and a half years, so we married then, in    46, and went to  Alabama where he had a job in soil conservation. I taught down there.  He passed away ten years later.  Then moved back?  Yes. We had two children that were three and five when he passed away.  I was offered a job back here in extension while I was here for the  funeral. So, I came back into Extension. That last year before I married,  I had gone to work in extension in the summer, because the summer  before I had stayed at Emma Chandler   s house. Norma Brumbaugh was  the state home demonstration agent, and they told me to come up and  interview with her at eight-thirty one morning. I had visited with her just  a little bit. She asked me three questions and said,    Sign that paper right  there at the bottom,    and it was already made out. So, I knew then why  those two other extension workers had been coming by the home ec  department every little bit, at least once or twice a month when I was  still teaching at Lindsay.  I had worked during the summer, that one summer, as a food  preservation specialist in Garvin County. The whole summer was spent  on dehydration, kraut making, canning, and freezing. I mentioned awhile  ago that we had electricity before I was born, so we had a home freezer  before most people did, and I had learned to freeze fruits and vegetables  and other things. So, I had a background in that. I worked in foods that  summer, and then they asked me to take the job in Garvin County full  time. So, when the summer was up in September, then I worked as a 4-H  agent in Garvin County.  I   m assuming you preferred doing the agent work versus teaching high  school?  Yes. The reason I preferred it because I got paid twelve months a year.  You didn   t get paid twelve months in high school teaching. I had  vocational home economics at Welch and I was paid eleven months, but  at Lindsay it wasn   t vocational. It was regular home economics and  science, and I taught general science and biology and home economics,  but it was just regular, and so I was just paid nine months a year there.  What   s the difference between regular home economics and vocational  9  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  home economics?  Well, the basic difference is that you are required to make home visits  with every one of your students in vocational home economics, and you  must get to know them much better. It may have been the difference in  the schools, but when I was doing vocational home economics, I was in  charge of the food stands for the athletic events like basketball and  things like that. I also did the banquets, the athletic banquets and things  like that. It really was a six day a week job, the vocational was. Besides,  you had to get those home visits in during the school year, during the  time that you were there, so I visited all the students and got to know  them that way.  Over the course of your career, how many different counties did you  work in?  I worked there at Welch in Craig County, then I worked in Lindsay,  which is barely in Grady County, and then I worked in Garvin County.  Then I went to Alabama. I had just been there a few weeks and I went to  the county superintendent   s office, and Dr. Smith says,    What took you  so long to get in here? We need teachers.    And I said,    Well, I had heard  that the home economics teacher was going to retire and I was interested  in that job.    I said,    I also have a teaching certificate in science and I can  teach junior high or senior high.    So, I taught there until the day I  moved. That was in Vernon,  Lamar County,  Alabama. Then my  husband was in soil conservation work. After that our first child was  born and then two years later, our second. Three years later, he died  from histoplasmosis that he contracted from the soil, and I came back to  Oklahoma to work for extension. I was assigned to Cotton County, and I  worked there for ten years. Then I came to Payne County and worked  twenty more.  When they assign you, do they give you a choice, or it   s just whatever is  open at that time?  You get some choice about whichever jobs are open, and the personnel  in the state office try to match your qualifications and your abilities with  the jobs in the counties.  Did the work vary that much between counties, like what you did in  Cotton versus what you were doing here?  No, not really, except that here, my title was Extension Home Economist  and I was assigned to work with the adults, but we had 4-H agents  whose husbands were in vet medicine and when they finished vet  medicine, they left. So, the time in between, I did 4-H work here, too.  10  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  You had been in 4-H in high school yourself?  I was in 4-H. I started back in what would   ve been junior high and high  school. I entered a county contest in clothing and in food demonstrations  back in Grady County.  When you got to OAMC, what were your favorite classes?  Foods. (Laughter) I think because I had had more experience in that,  because I had cooked with my grandmother and then later on with my  mother. We did a lot of canning, and I was left with the responsibility of  fixing meals for two or three hired hands and my sister and little brothers  when they would be gone to the ranch to work the harvest over east of  Chickasha. So, I had more experience in foods, probably, than anything  else.  At that time, too, OAMC had a practice house?  Yes, a home management house. At that time in the home management  house, you had a baby to take care of. Our baby   s parents lived at  Perkins, and the mother was going to school here at Stillwater and she  brought the baby in at seven-thirty every morning. We had that baby  until five or after in the evening. Some of the home management houses,  they had the baby all night, but we didn   t. We just had the baby during  the daytime.  How long would you have to stay in the home management house?  We were assigned six weeks, at a minimum, in the home management  house. We were on a block schedule and the home management house  was a part of your senior year and then you had practice teaching in  addition to that. I did my practice teaching in home economics at  McAlester, and then I did general science in the junior high here in  Stillwater and senior high in biology here in Stillwater. Then I did go  back and substitute when they needed a substitute for two or three days  at a time here in Stillwater.  Once you got into the county extension work, what was your favorite  part of that job?  I think probably my favorite part was the sewing workshops then  because I did teach basic clothing construction, how to use the sewing  machines and how to take care of them and how to adjust patterns and  make them fit different sizes and shapes of people. In addition to that, I  taught tailoring and drapery making, which was in the line of sewing  construction, too. Curtains. We made napkins and tablecloths and I   d  11  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  had experience with the 4-H projects earlier when we made towels and  pillow cases and tablecloths and pajamas.  I know when I first came, you mentioned mattresses, that you were glad  that you didn   t     Yes. The year before I started to work in Garvin County, that summer  they had made straw mattresses for a couple of years, and I was so glad  that they weren   t still making straw mattresses. Straw was available after  harvest, and it was free as far as most people were concerned. Some  people baled straw and they used it mostly for weather protection, but  they could make the cover for the mattress and then stuff it with straw. It  was fairly soft and after a little time, it was lumpy. (Laughter) But if  they would take it outside and shake it, sometimes they could hang it  across two clothes lines and get it back fairly even that way. I was so  glad I didn   t have to make straw mattresses.  Early on you worked at a boys    home?  Oh, that first summer when I was working in foods and food  preservation, dehydration and canning and kraut making, there was a  boys    home down at Pauls Valley and somebody had drained the juice  off a barrel of kraut. Nobody would admit it. So, somebody said,    Well,  all you need to do is just to watch those boys, and you   ll know pretty  soon by how often they   re running to the bathroom who drank the kraut  juice.     That   s a memorable experience, isn   t it?  Yes. (Laughter) I learned then what kraut juice was good for.  As you got more into your career, they changed the names?  Yes. We were home demonstration agents then and that title came from  the fact that most all your work was done in the homes. You visited the  homes and a neighborhood, like in Cotton County there was a club  called Daisy Club because they organized in the spring when the  pastures were blooming with daisies and it was down on Red River.  They chose Daisy for the name of the club. They would invite their  neighbors in and, if I remember right, there were twenty-some in that  Daisy Club. You had clubs in the different communities all over your  county. I think I started out with eighteen clubs down there.  Then you would go to their meetings, or they would come to you?  Yes, you would go to their homes and you would do your  12  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  demonstration. Maybe you were showing them how to can green beans.  I remember one lady said she had canned green beans but hers had been  spoiling. She thought she followed all the directions, and so in my  demonstration when the meeting was over she said,    You told me in the  first three minutes what my mistake was.    I said,    What was that?    and  she said,    You said,    Pick your green beans, have your jars and your  canner all ready to use, and be sure you   ve checked your canner so the  pressure is right. And then you pick your green beans and take them in  and wash them and snap them, and put them in the jars and put your  water and your salt and seal them, and put them in the cooker.       She  said,    I   m a nurse, and I   ve been picking mine the night before, and  washing them and putting them in the refrigerator.    That way you get a  higher bacterial count and it   s harder to control that way than it is if you  just bring them in. I said,    Run from the garden to the house.   (Laughter)  Would they choose what they wanted you to talk about or did you have a  set program or schedule you did?  Yes. We had a program-planning meeting and we had one or two people  come from each club. And I would try to keep current my reading and  going to state meetings and national meetings on what was new and  coming up, and I would have these listed. And then they would go down  the list and pick out twelve for the twelve months of the year that they  were most interested in, and the ones that got the most votes, then, were  the ones that we put in our program for the coming year.  So, a little bit of flexibility.  Then along about the third or fourth year I was working in extension,  they decided we should have leaders    meetings. You were to have two  people come in from each club to a leaders    lesson. In Cotton County,  the Cotton Electric Co-op was real cooperative and they had a real nice  meeting room with a little kitchenette up front on the stage, and that   s  what we used for our leaders    meetings. Then I still tried to visit each  club at least twice during the year, even though they did have a leader  that came to the meeting. Back the first year when I started, these clubs  had a social hour at the end of their meeting after their business and their  demonstration lesson, and then they had refreshments. I figured up how  much weight I had gained that first month that I worked in Cotton  County and gone to eighteen different clubs and had refreshments those  afternoons. I figured up in five years, I was going to weigh four hundred  and some pounds. (Laughter) So, from then on, I just told them,    No,  thank you.     It wasn   t just all food, though. You did economics and other things.  13  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Yes, money management, family money management, and landscaping.  I had quite a few landscaping courses. Back when I was majoring in  home economics, you were required to take pruning, trees and shrubs,  gardening, growing small fruits and vegetables, and of course there was  some of the other science courses related to that, too. And then I had  helped with a garden at home every year, and our garden at home was  about, oh, a good two acres. It was huge. We canned 300-500 quarts a  year off of that.  Where would you keep those?  We had a cellar that was about fourteen-foot square underneath our east  porch, and it served as storage for our canned goods and for our  homegrown honey, and as a storm shelter. There was a door in the floor  of the porch, so if a storm was coming up, you didn   t go clear outside.  You just raised that door up. Steps went down in the cellar.  Was that pretty common?  As far as I know. I remember, it looked odd to me, and I wondered why  people built them out away from the houses. I asked and someone said,     Well, they were afraid that the house would blow away or blow down  on top and they couldn   t get out.    But I think it was pretty common to  put them underneath the porch like that. This is sort of beside the point,  but my county treasurer had served as county treasurer for three or four  years in Cotton County. It is known as the tornado alley of Oklahoma.  We had had a county council meeting and there were clouds coming up  and the weather was getting kind of bad. So, instead of going by the  bank and putting the money in, she went home to Randlett. She was a  member of that Daisy Club that I mentioned. She went down in the  cellar. Her husband was home shortly after she got back home. And  while she was in the cellar, she thought,    I didn   t deposit that money,  and I left that money in the house, that I had from the council meeting.     When she came up out of the cellar, right in front of the cellar door hung  the bag of money on a tree limb. (Laughter)  The house was gone.   That   s pretty lucky   After that, she said she always went to the bank before she went home  with the money.  You had the food, then you did some consumers topics, and what else?  We had family relations, child care, understanding children at different  ages and their needs and their requirements, making children   s clothing.  I had two small children at that time, because I went back to work when  14  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  my children were three and five. I could make coats, for instance. I  could get them cut out and put facing on, and I could make the collars  and put inner facing on, and then I could use these in demonstrations and  sew these together. I used as much as I could for my children when I  was doing children   s things. When my son was big enough to wear a  regular shirt, I started making shirts, showing the women how to make  shirts for men and boys, and I could make shirts for them.  The day that President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, I was working on a  tailoring workshop and we were making coats and suits that day, and  that   s why I remember that. I was teaching the women how to put in  inner facings and do their facings, besides the fitting and selection.  About six years later, maybe a little longer, my daughter said,    Mom, do  you realize I have never had a ready-made coat?    She was a junior in  high school here in Stillwater then, and she had never had a ready-made  coat. I had made all her clothes and used them in demonstrations, and it  hadn   t dawned on me that she had never had a ready-made coat.  Did she get one later?  I gave her the money and she went downtown and bought a coat. It was  when the tapestry coats were real popular, and she bought that tapestry  fabric. She wore it one year and she said,    That   s not as warm as a coat  that you made.    (Laughter) That coat was made of the fabric she picked  out, was not really heavy enough for a good winter coat. So, I had  backed every piece of it with a hundred percent wool then put a satin  lining in it. So, her coat that was homemade was a lot warmer, and it  was slick and easy to get into. She   d worn it a couple of years but it still  looked just like new.  After awhile, that wasn   t the popular thing to do either, to sew and make  your own clothes, when more stores came in.  That particular coat was made the year that long coats for girls and  women were popular, down to their ankles instead of just below their  knees. So, she wore that coat for about ten years. She wore it all through  school here at OSU, and then her husband went to Chicago to dental  school and she worked in extension in Wisconsin. She wore that coat up  there because it was so much warmer than any of the others.  Can she make one herself?  She didn   t make a coat, but we went back to visit in Alabama when she  was in the fourth grade, we visited friends in Vernon, Alabama where I  had taught. One couple had a store down there. Mrs. Clearmon was one  of the ladies down there. Anyway, this couple took the kids around the  15  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  store, and I thought they were just looking at the store to see what a big  country store looked like. She had told the kids that they could have  what they wanted. I think my son got boots. Mrs. Loller, that my  husband had known when he was rooming and boarding there before the  war, was with us and she said,    I think Jan Ette can sew. Let her pick out  some fabric.    She picked out a dark brown corduroy to make a suit, so  she made her first suit when she was in the fourth grade.  Later she made  a suit and a yellow and tan coat she wore many years.   That   s impressive.  The first suit was a little boxer jacket and four gored skirt.  She majored in home economics at OAMC?  Yes, yes, she majored in home economics. One reason that she could  sew earlier than most 4-Hers was that I had to take her with me to 4-H  meetings when she was four, five, and six, because Cotton County didn   t  have any daycare centers or nursery schools at that time, or kindergarten.  So, she went with me to 4-H meetings and a lot of those were at night.  She just did whatever the other kids were doing, and when I was  showing them how to make a seam and how to make pillowcases and  how to make pajamas and things, she just did whatever I was showing  the other kids how to do. The first year project back then was a pin  cushion and a dish towel. So, she made her pin cushion and dish towel,  and when it was time for the county fair, she wanted to enter hers in the  county fair. Well, she couldn   t because she wasn   t nine years old. So, I  took it with me, and when the fair was over, I brought it back home. But  she didn   t win a ribbon on it because we didn   t enter it. Well, after she  had made her third pin cushion, I said,    Now, you get all your pin  cushions and your dish towels together and pick out the best ones.     Well, of course, the ones that she   d made last were the best. So, she won  a blue ribbon on those when she entered them. (Laughter) That   s when  she started sewing.  When you were traveling out to these different places in the county, did  you get reimbursed for mileage, or how did that work?  Yes, we did get reimbursed for mileage, but then somebody had the  bright idea in the state office up here that we could only use map  mileage, and when I would come from Walters to Stillwater to a  meeting, they took off, I think it was about fifteen miles through  Oklahoma City, they deducted that. And then when I went through  Chickasha, it was a couple of miles deducted. Then when I went through  Lawton, there was more deducted from my mileage. And, at that  particular time, it was eleven cents a mile. That ate up quite a lot of my  16  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  travel check.  Did you ever run into issues traveling out to the farms or to the  communities?  No. Back then, we didn   t have the gravel roads, or blacktop roads that  we have now. Of course, the cars were built higher, and you couldn   t  drive today   s car on some of those roads that we had to travel then.  You   d be on high center. I did, a few times, get stuck in the sand and I  had to shovel the sand out. I kept a shovel in my car. But I also put mud  tires on my car in November every year, and then I carried chains. If I  knew I was going to be on muddy roads, I usually went by a filling  station and had them put the chains on for me. I knew how, but it was  really hard for me to do. That was how we got around.  Did you have to do regular reports?  The reports, I think, were judged by their weight (laughter) because I  remember seeing some annual reports that were four inches thick. We  had to report all of our meetings, our planning meetings, our committee  meetings, our club meetings. And I hadn   t mentioned another part of the  extension program was working with commodity foods. I did, in Cotton  and Payne Counties, one at Walters and at Temple, there were people  from all over the county that came in there to get their commodity foods.  I would find out ahead of time what they were going to have and if it  was dried peaches, I showed them how to make fried pies. If it was corn  meal and flour, I showed them how to make yeast breads and cornbread  muffins and biscuits and things like that. For some reason, in Cotton  County, my 4   H girls, if they were not too involved in school at the  time, always liked to help, and that was a help, too. If you made samples  for 300 or 400 people, they liked to help. Of course, that went on their 4-  H records, too.  So, the reports were just done once a year?  The annual reports were done in December every year, and you had a  monthly report. The monthly reports were pretty thick. Then at the end  of the year, you went through your monthly reports, and you would put  clothing together and family life together, and gardening, and the  different phases of your program.  So you sent those in, and were they kept? Do you know?  As far as I know they were because years later, I saw some of those, like  I said, that were three and four inches thick. I kind of think there may be  some of them in this library annex.  17  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  I   ll check.  Or OSU out here.  So each county would keep them, or did they go into a state office?  There was a state report and a county report. At one time, the county  reports were in a storage room here in Payne County up on the top floor.  That was in the old courthouse building over there. I doubt since they   ve  changed so much   they made lawyers    offices up there, and the sheriff   s  office had to have more space, and they had to have more room for  prisoners. Extension was moved to the new annex with the county  commissioners, assessor and county clerk   s offices, so I don   t know if  they still have those.  Were they hand-written or typed?  Some of both. We had a full-time secretary and all the extension offices,  the three different ones that I worked in, worked full time. We had one  in Cotton County, we had two in Garvin County, and two in Payne  County. The secretaries would type them.  You would still have to write them.  Yes, you   d have to write them out by hand. We took dozens and dozens  of pictures too that were included in those reports.  Over the course of your career, you must   ve touched the lives of quite a  few young women. Did many of them follow in your footsteps?  Yes. Janie Crouch was one of my 4-Hers for twelve years in Cotton  County. Then she came up here to school, and she worked as a home  economist in Oklahoma County with the 4-H program until she retired.  Clara Powell was the home economist from Cotton County and she  worked in Oklahoma County. Glenna Williams worked with the  programs that had to do with commodity foods and low income families,  and she was in the state office until she retired. It really makes me feel  old when I look around and see my 4-Hers with white hair   When did you retire?  I retired in    80, and worked at the fair  twenty-four years since  and a  couple of times after that, and I worked in the extension office for free.  People would call and when I would say,    Betty Dahms,    they would  say,    What are you doing down there?    (Laughter) I was just  substituting while our secretaries were working out at the fair. Back  18  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  then, we had everything judged and had everything recorded. So, each  individual had all of the prizes they had won listed, and the checks. They  got their checks the last day of the fair when they took their exhibits  home. Now they get them three weeks later.  Well, they still have them, though, that   s a good thing. You switched  from Cotton to Payne. What brought you here?  I had been in Cotton County ten years and Ledora Chesbro had to do  graduate work. Then Dorothy Blackwell   Ledora had been before her,  and Dorothy Blackwell had had this job just before me. She was one of  my 4-Hers in Garvin County. Dorothy Blackwell wanted to be a  specialist. She had gone to graduate school, and when she decided to  take educational leave and finish her master   s, then this job was open.  My kids were both in high school by that time and they decided that it   d  probably be to my advantage if they were up here to go to school.  Somebody said something about it, I guess, and so I got to move with  my kids here when they were in high school. Of course, they both went  to OSU to school.  In the very beginning, did you have a certain dress code that you had to  follow to do your work?  In my work? Yes, and when we first moved to Stillwater, too. When we  first moved to Stillwater, I was told that the girls could not wear slacks  to school, summer, spring, fall or winter. They had to wear dresses. Not  jeans. Jeans were not worn at all except by the boys. I have a letter  someplace that was from Cleo Stiles, one of the home demonstration  agents, that said to be sure that we brought our gloves and our hats, that  we were to wear them to all meetings when we came up to Stillwater to  a state meeting. I remember having some of our state extension meetings  in Morrill Hall on the first floor. There was no air conditioning, and it  was about 105 degrees. (Laughter)  Was it a certain hat, or could you wear any hat?  You could wear any hat, but most of them were quite modest; pillbox-type  small hats. I thought somebody might say something if the brim  was more than three inches.  I   m assuming that an apron was a must-have?  Oh, yes, you had to wear aprons when you did any kind of a food  demonstration, and an apron was one of the first-year 4-H projects that  the girls made. Little white aprons with a bib and a band that went  around the neck that was big enough to slip over the head, and then there  19  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  were ties on each side to tie it in the back. You called them butcher   s  aprons.  Do you wear one now when you cook?  I have one in the pantry. (Laughter)  Let   s back up a little bit and have you talk about a typical day when you  first began as an extension agent back in Garvin County.  Well, the first year was in Garvin County and that was all food  conservation because that was during the last months of the war in    44  and    45. So, that would not be typical, because that was all in food  preservation, dehydration, canning, and things like that. That was back  when we sulfured fruit. We dried fruit out in the sun and put a net over it  to keep insects off of it. But a typical day would be, I always left for the  office about seven-thirty every morning because our office opened at  eight. Usually, there was somebody there at five    til. In Cotton County  we did 4-H clubs in the morning. At that time, the county agent and I did  a program every month during the school year at each one of the 4-H  programs. We did all those in the morning so I could do the women   s  work in the afternoon, and he worked with the men in the afternoon. If  we were going to go to, say, Randlett, which was approximately  eighteen or twenty miles away, we would need to leave by eight-thirty.  We would have a regular 4-H meeting and if it was for fourth grade  through high school, we usually divided it into a grade school group and  a high school group and we   d have two 4-H meetings with  demonstrations appropriate for each one. We would have it as a regular  business meeting. They would have their officers and they   d conduct the  meeting. They   d have the Pledge of Allegiance and their song with their  little song leaders and their business reports. We tried to encourage them  as much as possible for a 4-H demonstration to be given by either the  boys or the girls at each one of those meetings, and then we would give  a part of the program. Then we   d rush from that one over to the next  meeting. If we had two at Randlett, we could get those two done  together. Temple was another town in Cotton County, and we   d go over  there and do the same thing. We   d have a grade school and a high school  meeting, then back at Walters.  Then, in the afternoon, those clubs met at two in the afternoon, and that  barely gave us time to get back and get things loaded up to take to the  club in the afternoon to do a program. They would usually meet at two  and they   d have their opening exercises and then they   d have business  and then they   d have the demonstration. If it was, say, making yeast  breads, then you   d take all your ingredients and you   d make your bread.  20  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  And when you finished, you might have one with you that you had  already finished to show them what it would look like finished. I learned  right away that when you made bread in a demonstration in the  afternoon, if you covered that up and put it in the trunk, that was ideal  rising temperature. It was ready to put in the oven when you got back to  the county seat. You had to go back, then, and read your mail and take  care of all of that had come in during the day and get your things out for  the next day. By that time, it was about five-fifteen.  Long day. Busy day.  It was really handy down there because the court house was just a half a  block from the grocery store, and across the street from the grocery store  was the laundry. So, I had my laundry one day a week in the trunk of the  car. I took it out and put it in the washers, and then I went over and got  groceries. When I got back, my laundry was ready to take home. I took it  home and the kids walked to school and from school. They were ready  at home to help hang out the laundry, or they did chores around the  house like the mowing and pruning and spraying the plants and so forth.  They helped at home. Sometimes I had a night meeting at Hulen, about  twenty miles away, and I always took the kids with me when I had a  night meeting. That was another 4-H meeting, and that was just a grade  school at Hulen, up in the northeast corner of the county. I usually was  home by nine-thirty or ten.  Did they sleep in the car on the way home?  No, they were night owls, (laughter) but they were ready to go to bed  when they got home.  You had to be a very good time manager and organizer to get through  the day.  Yes, you learned a lot about organizing. Then, on Saturdays is when we  had our county-wide or district events like Share the Fun and 4-H  demonstration contests, speech contests and things like that. So, you  were working on Saturdays, too. The first year that I worked in  extension in Garvin County, we kept the office open until noon, until  twelve. In Cotton County, our secretary wasn   t available on Saturdays  and she didn   t work Saturdays, but we did because we had 4-H events.  Like, for meat judging, I would leave Walters at six-thirty in the  morning because meat judging usually would begin a little before eight  in Oklahoma City, and I   d have at least four girls or boys judging meat,  and I   d take them to the meat plant in Oklahoma City. Then we   d get  home late that afternoon, between four and five, after they had been to  the meat judging in Oklahoma City.  21  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Did you have a lot of comp time that you got to use later?  No.  No?  No, we joked a lot about extension was a full-time job. It was, because  some days we worked from six or seven in the morning, lots of days.  Those days, like, if you had to have a judging team in Tulsa or  Oklahoma City by seven or seven-thirty, then you had to leave home  pretty early that morning. Then, if you had a meeting that night, you  might have a workshop. When microwave ovens came out, I had all of  my microwave cooking workshops at night, and I had anywhere from  thirty-five to forty-eight in each one of those. I showed them how to  cook meats and vegetables and desserts. Microwave ovens don   t do well  for breads because they don   t brown. But I did some things like warm up  muffins, just a few seconds, or biscuits a few seconds, and you could  take them out of the freezer and put them in the microwave. And I did  whole meals in the microwave that way, and then I let them sample the  foods afterwards.  How did you learn to do those things? Would you have to go to a  meeting yourself and be trained?  I went to the national meeting every year and the first thing I learned the  first year was the similarity of extension in Oklahoma and Wisconsin  and Arizona and New York, by going to those national meetings every  year. I was active in our state organization and served as a district officer  and a state officer, then as president of our Oklahoma group. So, I got to  go to all those meetings, and we had professional time, or vacation time,  that you used to go to those. Usually, you would go on a Saturday and  then you got back on a Friday or Saturday, depending on how far away  they were.  A week?  That was the way I kept up. Then I got acquainted with people from,  like, J.C. Penney Company, and when I had something on buying, I had  a national representative I could invite them to come to Oklahoma or to  my county. The only workshop that I had special training for was when  knits, like nylon and polyester like this  tablecloth , came out. I took a  week workshop in Minneapolis in February in ice and snow. (Laughter)  I went up there where they were making knits, and they let us use  samples to learn to sew on. This tablecloth, for instance, is one of them  that I made then, and I just stretched out the yardage and laid it on the  table, and then I took my hem marker and went around and marked it  22  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  with chalk all the way around, so many inches down from the table.  Then picked up the lace and just laid it on there. See, it doesn   t ravel, so  you just lay the lace on the edge and there   s no hemming and there   s no  bulk there. These knits do not ever have to have any ironing. You just  put them in the washer if somebody spills something on it, no problem.  You just gather it up and throw it in the washer, and put it back.  That   s the nice thing about polyester.  Yes. You can   t buy this now.  I haven   t looked, so I don   t know.  Well, I think it   s a shame. I helped one of the ladies in our church and  then later two or three others came in and helped, but we bought white  polyester knit like this and lace and made thirty-some tablecloths for the  Methodist church. And you can   t do that anymore. It   s just not available.  It was popular back in the    70s, I guess?  Those were done in the    60s and    70s. One of the larger chain stores,  Hancock   s or one of them still in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, carried it for  awhile and we went there and got some and made extras when we could  see that we were going to have more people and we needed to have  extras on hand. Those were extension club members that helped make  those.  Most counties have several clubs; it   s not one club per county?  Right. I had twenty-two in this county.  In Payne County?  In Payne County. They are down, but everybody knows the reason for  that. More and more of the young women are working full-time jobs  away from home, and they can   t have daytime meetings. There are some  that meet at night, and then there are the older club members that do  meet in the day or they have a day off or they can take a half day off  from their jobs. Like you mentioned Pinevale, those are older women.  There are younger women in Elm Grove. They have a good-sized  growing club. They were new members when I first came to the county.  When I met with them at Christmastime this year, some said they   d been  in the club for thirty years  But they   re getting new members in their  club. They   re inviting the young women that live on the farms around  Elm Grove school out in the southwest part of the county. So, that   s a  growing club. I would say the average age probably would be between  23  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  sixty-five and seventy in Cherokee Club, because most of those are  retired people that have had association with extension work through  their lives, and they joined that club. That   s the reason that   s a real  active club. Where there were twenty-two Payne County clubs; now I  think there are only seven in Payne County.  Quite a drop.  As I have looked over the state records, some counties only have two or  three now.  Interesting. Are most of the women that participate still connected to a  farm?  No. In the beginning they were, and the first 4-H clubs were called farm  clubs and calf clubs and such, but the majority of the extension  homemakers are living in town. I have even had some people say to me,     I didn   t know I could join. I thought you had to live in the country.     I   ve heard that through the years. But that   s never been the case. Since I  started to work full time in    56, I worked those other years before. Then,  I came back to work full time and worked full time from    56 until I  retired in the    80s.  And over that course of time working with home demonstration clubs,  how many cookbooks do you think you   ve helped pull together?  (Laughs) Oh, I don   t know. I know they ordered 5,000 at a time, and  some editions, they have had to have them reprinted three times.  For Payne County?  Not Payne County. For all of them I think they probably ordered 5,000. I  don   t know for sure how many they ordered for Payne County. Are you  familiar with ours?  No. I   m going to have to look.  Hold on a minute.  Alright.  Have you heard people say something about the green one? This is the  one I know they   ve sold 15,000, and this one is Garvin County, and this  one is the last of the Oklahoma cookbooks. I didn   t see Payne County. I  saw the Methodist church, but I didn   t see Payne County. I have one.  24  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  They do more than just the county? This is the state.  Yes, that one   s state; this one   s county. This one   s state. This is the  newest one. This tells in there when the first edition was.  This one   s old.  Those people who send those recipes in are people who really like to  cook, and I found them to be better quality than a lot of other  cookbooks.  I bought myself one from Grady County, and you mentioned Cleo Stiles?  Yes.  I borrowed hers from another library,    Seems Like I Done It This A-way.     Yes. I   ve got two of those of hers in there.  I   d love to have a copy. I   m going to have to try to see if I can find one  to keep.  Now her recipes are good because that was her major field, foods. She  was state president and national president, too. But she traveled to all of  the states and several other countries, and she had people that were here  on educational scholarships and so forth that were interested in  extension and they were with her. So she   s got recipes from other  countries, too. I think she always tells in her book where they   re from.  But she checked them out thoroughly before she put them in books to  see that it was workable.  Do you think most of the other ones did that same thing, tested, tried and  true?  Yes, but I   ve got several recipe books that are not tried and true recipes  that people just   an organization told everybody they had to turn in  recipes, and some of those people didn   t cook. (Laughter)  Wasn   t there an award for her, too? Cleo Stiles Bryan?  I think so. I can   t remember now what that was. She was only a couple  of years older than me, and she died quite a while back.  Yes, in Tahlequah  in 2001 . Would you still encourage young women to  do this type of work?  25  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Yes. I would still encourage people to join clubs. I think if there was an  interest   of course, that   s partly the extension educator   s responsibility,  to create that interest. I thought one of the nicest compliments I ever had  was some young girl stopped me in a store one day and she said,    I want  you to meet my husband,    and she introduced her husband. She said,     This is the one that taught me to make bread,    and I appreciated that.  So evidently she enjoyed making bread after she learned, and her  husband enjoyed her bread, too. I   ve had anywhere from up to 110  people in some bread workshops.  Do you still give them?  No. I   m retired. (Laughter)  I   d sign up for the next one.  I   m retired, and I   ve got to make ham loaf for seventy people this week.  And I   m the devotional chairman and program chairman for UMW, and  last week we had the County Food Festival and I baked bread and  cinnamon rolls for that. Some man bought mine just inside the door  before I even set them down on the table. (Laughter) I don   t know who  he was.  You   re still a good cook. Besides doing 4-H with the male county agent,  did you do many other things with the male counterpart?  The men that I worked with were all really nice. In Cotton County, the  agent there was about the same age as I was. He and his wife had  children close to the age of mine. He helped me with plant identification  and landscaping and things like that, and we both took the short courses.  I think they were three-hour courses and it went all semester. We met at  Cameron campus in Lawton, and we went from four o   clock in the  afternoon until nine or ten o   clock at night. What I remember most about  that was going up there one day; it was cold like it   s been here lately.  The temperature was eighteen degrees and we were supposed to have  had pruning that day. We were so glad that we weren   t going to have to  prune. The fellow that had that pecan grove on that land along on the  south side of Twelfth Street here in Stillwater, he taught that. He made  us prune in that freezing weather, from four-thirty until dark that day.  Just the two of you, or the whole class?  Oh, the whole class.  He wanted his work done.  26  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Yes, I think there were about, oh, twenty-three, twenty-two, twenty-four,  somewhere along in there, that were in the class. I think there were three  other women, home economists, that were in there. The rest of them  were men.  As you go on up the career ladder, in that time in the beginning, most of  your supervisors would   ve been men?  Yes. And I still am not aware if there are any  women  that are the  county directors. The county agent was just automatically the county  director. You were responsible in the county to the county  commissioners, and you have a district supervisor and a state personnel  supervisor.  Are they held by men, mostly?  Yes.  Has that changed much?  There have been four districts most of the time in Oklahoma, and part of  the time there was a fifth district, the central counties, and there was a  district home economist and a district supervisor of county agents. But I  don   t know what they have now. I haven   t kept up with it.  Sounds like this is a job that you   re always having to learn more and  retool and keep up.  Oh, yes, it is something that you constantly are updating yourself.  Because during my time, like I said, I started back right at the end of the  straw mattresses, but then I went into food preservation during the last  year and a half of the war. We did an abundance of that. We also worked  with the vo-ag teachers that had canning kitchens in the summer and we  worked with them and supervised those. People could bring their stuff in  and you showed them how and helped them get it ready for the canners,  and they had big pressure canners so they could can. Some of them  would can nine quarts at a time and some of them would can eighteen  quarts in those big pressure canners that the vo-ag kitchens had, and we  worked with them.  I guess freezing foods was probably one of the bigger programs right  after that. We did do quite a bit of dehydration and then the convection  ovens came out. You could set them on low temperatures and the fans in  them circulated the air, and you could use those for dehydration but you  also used them for cooking. Those convection ovens came out after I  started, then the microwaves. You got acquainted with the business  27  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  people over your county, too. There was a Montgomery Ward manager  at Cushing that offered me a microwave oven when they first came out  to use to demonstrate for the people around over the county, and I was  really shocked about that. Other things that were brand new, like when  the convection ovens, portable ones, came out, I bought that at a  discount at the national meeting. That   s the way I was able to afford to  keep up with those.  And then, like I said, I went to the factory to learn how to sew on knits.  There was a man down at Perkins that owned the dry goods store that  was there for years and years, and he made arrangements for me to use  the Lion   s Club den to have a workshop down there. I had people come  from Logan County and all around, besides Payne County, because it  was new and they hadn   t had it in their counties yet. They heard about it  and came to Payne County. That was because the owner of that store  was so cooperative and he provided the place, really, for me. I know I  thought I   d have about twelve or fifteen that day and ended up with  forty-some.  You   re a popular person   Well, the word gets around.  Especially if you   re good.  I   ve just got to tell you this. You know, I never had any problem with  segregation, and we worked with black 4-Hers and black women as well  as white, and in Cotton County, we had a sewing workshop for  beginners at the black school in Temple. I mentioned that my older 4-  Hers were eager to help with anything, whether it was commodity foods  or sewing workshops for beginners down there. I had two girls with me,  and one girl was my daughter. I helped them get started and I needed to  go back to do something else, and it was eleven miles from Walters.  They were going to finish the sewing projects, and the girls were going  to stay there and help them. Well, the older girl was sixteen years old  and had her driver   s license, and it got to be five o   clock, and six  o   clock, and they weren   t back. I was through at the office by that time,  so I went back down there. They had finished their sewing projects, and  both girls played the piano and sang. Those little black girls were still at  that school, singing. They finished their sewing workshop projects and  they were singing.  After we moved to Stillwater, one time when we were going to go back  down there, I said to my daughter,    Who do you want to go visit?    and  one of those little black girls was one that she wanted to see. This little  girl, I read in the papers from down there, had been an outstanding  28  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  student. I brought her mother as one of the representatives from the  county up here to a homemakers    conference in August one year. She  brought her little preschooler, I think she was four then, with her. You  know who she wanted to room with?  Your daughter?  Yes. So, that little black girl and my little daughter slept together.  (Laughter) And that was who she wanted to go back and see, because  she was in high school by this time when I asked her that. One of the  most interesting things I thought, you know, I told you how I would  watch for things that were new and different every year and then I   d give  a list to my leaders when we   d have our planning meeting. Well, one  year, we were having a planning meeting and I had listed a lot of our  things on there, and I said,    Before we start on that, I want you to tell  me, each one of you, to write down the program that you enjoyed most  last year.     Well, I had been told that black people were not allowed to stay  overnight in Yale. They could come during the day, but they had to  leave at sundown. The program that the most people listed that they  enjoyed most the year before was decorating blue jeans. That   s when  those fancy ones, they started wearing them with all the decorations on  them and they were thirty-five and forty dollars. You could buy jeans for  eight or ten dollars and decorate them as pretty or prettier than those.  That was the lesson they liked best, and there was a girl that worked at  Bates   , a black girl, that I took with me. She did the program on  decorating jeans. I said,    The black girl?       No. Was she black?    They  didn   t know she was black and she was black as could be. So, I didn   t  have any problem, either.  I wonder if any of those girls turned out to be home demonstration  ladies.  I don   t know, but I didn   t have the 4-H program as such. I just  substituted three weeks or six weeks at a time. I remember some of them  over at Cushing asked me why didn   t I just stay with the 4-H program  instead of doing the adult program. Well, I was hired to do the adult  program, and that was my program. They had younger people that were  just starting out doing 4-H. I thought, well, I guess that was a  compliment, but I didn   t do that. So, I didn   t have charge of the 4-H  program, so I couldn   t say.  You just volunteered to help whenever you could.  I just helped whenever I could. And usually, we had a 4-H home  29  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  economist for at least three years, sometimes four. Joy Scomp, whose  husband was also a vet medicine student, graduated, and she left about  the same time that I came. I didn   t actually work with her, but she was  the last one that was here. Then the last one that I started was Nancy  Dunlap, and Nancy retired last week. (Laughter)  Twenty-five years, thirty years?  I don   t know what she had in, but I didn   t think she worked more than  ten or fifteen. (Laughter)  Time flies when you   re having fun.  But she retired last week, and they had a party for her on the fifth or  somewhere along in there. You know, you retire and your retirement  date is after your annual leave that you have accumulated, so she may  not have worked in January, I don   t know. But I just couldn   t believe  she   s retiring.  You   ve influenced a lot of people over the years.  Yes. Last year, I went in to a basketball game at the high school. The  aisle was over there, and Ron and Becky Holt were sitting in the first  two seats, and Rick Jungers, my son-in-law, the dentist, and Jan Ette,  there was a vacant seat and they were in the next two seats. I tapped Ron  on the shoulder and Rebecca was sitting next to him. I said,    Would you  kids let me in?    (Laughs) They   re grandparents. But they were in the  fourth and fifth grade at Randlett when I was the 4-H agent down there.  Good memories.  She   s the SHS counselor. She has been a counselor up here in a high  school, and  she also taught business classes . But anyway, my  granddaughter, Becca, forgot to tell me that she   d volunteered to make  rolls for eighty people. Rebecca had asked Becca to do that, and  Rebecca knew who our Becca was. Becca came over here in August  before the fair one year, and I have grapevines on my back fence. She  picked the grapes and washed them and took the stems out and put them  in the kettle and put some water on them. She made grape jelly, and she  picked out two of her best jars to enter in the county fair. She said,     What am I going to do with all the rest of this?    I said,    Well, I   ll eat  two of them, and you can take two of them home, and take the others to  Rebecca Holt.       But I don   t know what to say to her.    I said,    Just tell  her that you made them at your grandmother   s.    So, after that, she   d  meet her in the hall and Rebecca would do like that and bump her and  say to Becca,    Don   t you have any more leftover jelly?    (Laughter)  30  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  So, we have lots of ties, but that   s because you get to know these people.  When you do commodity foods demonstrations every month, I usually  had from 100 to over 300 people that watched those demonstrations. I  used the food that they were getting that month, you know, to make  something out of. I had the state director there one time and didn   t know  it. I wondered who that man was, sitting in the back row talking to the  county welfare director in Cotton County. I didn   t find out until after the  meeting was over that that was the state director sitting back there  watching. (Laughs)  Maybe it   s better you didn   t know. (Laughter)  Well, I was glad I didn   t know.  You become like a member of the family, I guess, to some of them, don   t  you?  Yes. Sometimes, you feel like you   ve failed. Like one family I  remember. They weren   t allergic to cheese, but they either threw away  or gave away ten pounds of cheese every time they got it. They didn   t  want to eat it and they didn   t want to teach their children to eat cheese,  and that was the best cheese, better than what you could buy because it  was fresher. There was a creek that emptied into Red River down there.  If you took Highway 5 from Temple over to Randlett, you could always  find beans and rice in the creek. If they didn   t want it, they dumped it  before they got home with it. The thing that I learned was that the  majority of those people that get that didn   t prepare food with it. They  took it in and set it on a table, and I   ve visited those families, too. They  would take a knife or a can opener to open those cans, and there   d be  cans sitting around over the table, some of them with mold and flies in  them. They made no effort to set a table and prepare food.  They didn   t know how or they chose not to?  Well, I was trying to teach them how. That makes you feel like you   re a  flunky when you can   t teach them to do those things. I just tried my best  over and over. Now, you know, those were exceptions, too, because  there were others that   well, like, one man and his wife were elderly.  Those welfare people, you had to talk your way in because they thought  you were checking on them or you were going to report them or  something. I had to gain their confidence to know that I wasn   t going to  tell anybody anything. I was just there to help them. One man told me  that his wife was ill and he was taking care of her. She was really an  invalid. He said he would love to have homemade biscuits. So, I went in  the kitchen and showed him how to make biscuits.  31  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  I don   t remember what I showed another man over at Randlett, but he  wanted to pay me, and I said,    No  I can   t accept any money or  anything.    So, he dug up some Bells of Ireland out of his yard, and I  kept those growing for twenty years, and I finally lost them after I  moved up here and had them out here in my backyard. That   s all he had,  but he wanted to pay me. Then, there was another one, let   s see. That  was a woman taking care of a husband that was an invalid, and you have  never seen a cleaner, more spotless house. They had a little three-room  cabin-like, but it was perfectly clean. She tried to do everything like you  suggested. It got over to some of them. I didn   t believe, when I started  working with these poverty families that some of them, their  achievement goal in life was to get on welfare. Did you know that?  Yes. I was a social worker for ten years     Oh  Well, you knew. But I didn   t know that until I got to working with  them. And one lady, she was eighty-some years old and the first thing  she said,    Oh, I am so happy. I   ve got all my family on welfare now.  Even my grandson.     Kind of sad, isn   t it?  I didn   t believe that, until that day.  You just have to focus on the ones you can help.  You have some good memories and some that you feel like you just  didn   t ever get across to them.  And your family, you   ve had three people come through Oklahoma State  University? Yourself, your daughter, and your granddaughter? Or more  than that?  Yes, my two brothers, my two children. And I didn   t tell you that I had  seventeen other kids, did I?  No. And who are they?  (Laughs) They just showed up. One of them was the daughter of Ruth  King, that was the home economist in Grady County, and she majored in  foods and dietetics. She got a job in Hawaii after she graduated here.  Then she came back for an internship, because when she was in Hawaii,  she was a resident of Hawaii and she could apply at OSU for an  internship. She came back here for an internship, and she stayed with  me. Well, at the same time, I had a niece that came up here as a  freshman and majored in elementary education, and when she checked  32  Finchum  Lewis  into Willard Hall, she had paid her deposit almost a year ahead, they put  her in a basement room with no windows. She took one load of her  things in and she said,    I think I know a better place.    So, she went back  and got her things and told the house mother that she was going  someplace else. I came home from work and she was here.  This King girl, Kathy King was the daughter   s name, she came to the  door at nine o   clock one night. I didn   t even know that she was back in  the States, and she had come to Stillwater to enroll. She had visited with  my daughter, because she was closer to the age of my daughter and older  than my niece, Jennifer. She came in about nine o   clock and she said,     Jan Ette, Rick told me to come over here, that you had room.    She  stayed the rest of the year. She stayed September until the next year  when she finished her internship and her master   s degree.  Then I came home one night and there was a boy sitting on the sofa in  there. I said,    And who are you?    He said,    I   m Franz DeVries.    He was  a Dutch boy that was ten years old when Janette was a 4-H exchange  student one summer in the Netherlands. He had been to Canada and  worked with an uncle in harvest all summer, and then he rode a bus  across Canada to see Canada and Disneyworld, and came here. He had  scheduled his bus rides so that he was riding during the night and sight-seeing  days. He always scheduled a bus trip so he could sit on the bus  and sleep. He didn   t have to pay for a room. That kid was dead tired  when he got here, and that was on a Wednesday night when he appeared.  My niece, Jennifer, was standing in the door, and she was just grinning  and she hadn   t said a word. Finally, he said,    Well,    she let him in  (Laughs) and I said,    Jennifer?      She called her mother and dad the next night and said she was going to  bring a boy home with her. Well, you know, I didn   t hear Jennifer say  anything for about five minutes, but then she said,    Yes    no    yes     okay.    So, when she went home on Friday night, she took Franz Devries  with her and when they got to their farm at Verden, the hired man was in  the hospital with appendicitis. When she came back on Sunday night, I  said,    Jennifer, what did you do with Franz?    He didn   t come back with  her. She said,    Oh, I left him at home to drive the tractor for Dad.    He  stayed down there two or three weeks and drove the tractor, and then he  came back here and stayed until his visa run out. But the word had  gotten out that he was here and that he was willing to mow yards or do  flower beds or pruning. We had jobs lined up for six weeks for that kid,  and he stayed until his visa run out and he went back home.  Hotel Betty. (Laughter)  A girl that was closer to my daughter   s age when she was an exchange  33  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  student wrote us a letter and said she wanted to come over here when  she finished high school over there and do her senior year over here,  because that would give her better qualifications for advanced study  over there. So, Els came over and stayed a year, and I made  arrangements with the high school for her. She got a job working at the  Union as a waitress and earned, oh, between  300 and  400 while she  was here and went to high school. My daughter, by that time, was a  sophomore at OSU, then she came back two times after that after she  was married and brought her husband Bert with her. She works at, it   s  Farm Security here, I don   t know what they call it over there. That   s just  a few of the kids that I had.  And you influenced a lot of people.  I had seventeen all together. (Laughs) I had one that I   m not going to tell  you about that was an Iranian student that was in trouble with the law,  I   m sure. She was from a broken home in Iran. Her mother was a  teacher, and I don   t remember what her dad was. She wrote hot checks  and she gave my address as hers. How I let her in was she just appeared  at the door one afternoon and said that my niece from Kiowa, Oklahoma  told her that I kept kids sometimes and that she could probably stay with  me. She had lost her room; she didn   t get back in time. She   d gone to  Tahlequah, she said, for the summer, and she   d been going to school at  OSU. Well, I found out afterwards you couldn   t believe one word she  said, so I don   t know what the problem was, because I found out later  she   d even gone to Langston for a while. But then when she was here,  she just did one crooked thing right after another until I finally told her  that she had to be out by the end of September or I was going to get a  lawyer to get her out. So, she left. I still got hot checks back here for a  long time after that. But there was something badly wrong. Well, on top  of that, she had charged seventy-five dollars one month to me, a  telephone call to Iran, to talk to her mother. You know, that girl doesn   t  count. She   s not one of the seventeen. (Laughs)  Seventeen plus one.  But I had boys and girls, and one of the boys is a doctor now. One of the  other girls that was here is director of a vo-tech school in the Sapulpa  area. She just appeared one Monday night here. One became a home  economist in Oklahoma County until she retired. One is real active in  her church. She doesn   t have an away-from-home job, but she majored  in childcare and she had a nursery for a number of years. Her husband is  a USDA employee and he works at El Reno and in China. He goes back  and forth to China every little bit. All of them have done well.  That boy that Jennifer left down in Grady County to do the wheat  34  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  planting that fall, he   s a farmer in the Netherlands now and he looks  after that land, and I imagine he   s on their county and state committees.  His father was, ahead of him. Then, my niece that let him in the door  that night went with (I think it was Delta Kappa Gamma) teachers one  summer to Europe, and she went to see Franz in the Netherlands. She  called him and he came in to visit with her. She saw him that once after  he was here. That niece has taught twenty-some years at Chickasha, in  first grade. She said she was going to retire and I said,    Oh, you can   t.    I  said,    You   re not old enough to retire.       Aunt Betty  I have already  taught twenty-two years.    (Laughter) That was several years back when  she told me that.  When you   re busy, it just flies, though, doesn   t it?  Yes.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say? Or  how would you like to be remembered, if that   s easier? Besides that you  were an excellent bread maker.  Well, I enjoyed helping people. I was lucky that I started out with my  grandmother and I realized as I was majoring in home economics that I  had an advantage that she had taught me a lot more than other girls that  had an opportunity to learn. In that way, I had a lot of experience that  some of the others probably didn   t. It was an advantage as a homemaker  and as a teacher and as an extension employee. Teaching science for six  years, there were always demonstrations like emulsification or soap  making and things like that that I would tell the kids what they were  doing and have the supplies for them, and then,    Oh  That   s  mayonnaise     or    Oh  That   s soap     You know, they were always  surprised that I could do things like that with them.  I had made friends through the years that helped. There were a lot of  things like TV, computers, convection ovens, microwave ovens, sewing  with knits and ultra suede and things that came out during my time. I did  a lot of night workshops that people that were working during the day  could come to. Those at night were how to use a microwave oven or to  refinish furniture or repair or remodel clothes and things like that.  Did you have to teach how to use the crock pot, too?  Yes, but that was not one of my favorites, because of the slow cooking  and the dangers of contamination.  Okay. I wasn   t sure where it fell in there. People still use them, though.  35  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Lewis  Finchum  Yes, but I emphasize more cooking by shorter methods and not cooking  foods too long.  Was your county office in the courthouse?  Yes.  And it had a kitchen, I   m assuming, if you took bread back?  No, the way I managed when I had things for the kitchen, at the  courthouse, we had a meeting room, and there was no kitchen. I just  used a  portable convection oven and a  regular eight-foot table, or I did  it out at the fairgrounds where I did have a kitchen. When I had those  bread shops I had a pre-enrollment and if I knew I was going to have a  hundred or more, I always scheduled those for the fairgrounds.  I just wondered because you had mentioned you took a loaf of bread and  put it in your car trunk and had it at home. I wondered how it got baked.  When I did bread demonstrations, I made the bread. I had some that had  raised, ready to bake and I shaped that into a loaf, and I had one that was  already baked. One that I shaped into a loaf, I could bake it at the fair  building. Because you   d have to show them what it was like  at different  stages: mixing, kneading, raised, ready to bake and one baking, to come  out of the oven and finished. The mixed and kneaded loaf would rise in  the car trunk. It was baked at home for my kids.   It comes back to being organized, doesn   t it?  Yes.  Well, it   s been a great interview. I appreciate all that you   ve shared with  me today, and if we end up having more questions, we   ll do a round two.  Oh  (Laughs)  Thank you.  -------  -------
