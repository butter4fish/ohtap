 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is December 13, 2013,  and I   m in Wagoner, Oklahoma, talking with Cherokee artist Ron  Mitchell. Ron, you   ve been in the Native art business for more than  forty-two years, and you   ve won over three hundred awards at numerous  Native art shows in and out of state. You   re known for your creative  approaches in matting and presenting artwork, as well. You always have  a beautiful, professional booth setup     Thank you.     and you recently moved to Wagoner from Prague. Thank you for  taking the time to speak with me today.  It was my pleasure.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born in Fort Benning, Georgia, when my dad was in the Army. He  was stationed there after being up in the Aleutian Islands during the  early outbreak of the war. I grew up at different Army bases around the  world until I was in the eighth grade. Every year I was at a different  school, and three years I was in Germany for a while.  Oh, my goodness. You mentioned that your dad was in the Army. How  about your mom?  Mom was a housewife. She pretty much stayed around the house.  Always kind of related to Dad running it like continuing part of the  Army: He was the first sergeant, Mom was the corporal, and me and my  brother were the privates. (Laughter)  So one sibling. Is he older or younger?  5  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  He   s younger. Yeah, I was an only child for six years, and he came  along and messed it up.  Is your Cherokee on your mom or your dad   s side?  My dad   s side.  Did you have much contact with your grandparents on either side?  Actually, both grandparents on both sides. When we were stateside,  particularly before my brother was born, when Dad was stationed at Fort  Sill, I spent a lot of the summers in Tulsa and Locust Grove. My  mother   s mother lived in Tulsa, and my dad   s mother, the Cherokee, she  lived in Locust Grove. They   d stick me on a bus and send me back and  forth. I remember, four or five years old, riding the bus back and forth  by myself. Do that today. (Laughs)  I bet that was a great adventure. Were you around the language, then, a  little bit and culture, growing up?  Grandma spoke Cherokee. She was not a traditionalist. A lot of her  friends were. She was a Baptist. We had an interesting history about the  language. I didn   t know it when I was younger. I know now, but  growing up, all my cousins on my Cherokee side of the family are girls.  Grandma would, when we would all stay up there at her house at Locust  during the summer, after breakfast every day she   d make the girls stay in  and teach them Cherokee. I was allowed to go outside and play. I never  thought anything about it. I just thought I was a privileged character,  being the only male child.  Later, reviewing history and looking at some of our family records, I ran  across a letter from Anthony Foreman. He married Susan Gourdfields.  This was in the 1700s, so that   s seven generations back. In this letter, he  wrote that,    I want all the male children to dress and speak English,     because they were going to have to carry on business in a white man   s  world. He wanted all the girls to speak and dress Cherokee, to carry on  the Cherokee tradition. The irony of the thing is that I   m the only one  that carried on the Cherokee tradition today, and I still don   t speak the  language. (Laughs) I couldn   t even ask for cornbread if I was starving.  Wow, and this is the Foreman family that you come from?  Yes. Yes, ma   am.  Did you have any other family members who were artists?  6  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Not on our Cherokee side of the family. On my mother   s side of the  family, the Hensleys, there were some very talented people. My cousin,  who   s a year younger than me, she   s a well-known wood carver out in  the Northwest United States and Oregon.  What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Oh, I guess probably when I first started doing art shows because  growing up, I just don   t recall being around   well, wait a minute. There  was a time I remember we went to Spiro Mounds as a little boy. I  remember that was probably the first time that I was around anything  that was of Native American. Of course, growing up in Locust Grove in  the summer, and Dad being in the Army down at Lawton, I was around a  lot of the Kiowa and Comanche style of work in high school.  What is your first memory of making art?  The first memory of making art was actually an experience in the second  grade that probably would   ve discouraged most people from ever being  an artist. Teachers today, I hope are considerably more understanding.  At the time, well, I am red-green colorblind, very seriously red-green  colorblind. In the second grade, I had no idea I was colorblind. I just  thought I was little slow in figuring out colors. I remember we did this  Crayola drawing, and it was supposed to be a tree. Of course, I was the  only one in the class that actually had roots on the tree, branches on the  tree, but she held the picture up in front of the class and tried to  humiliate me because of the colors I used in it. She said,    Look at this  picture. Can you believe this? He has a purple sky, a green tree trunk,  and brown grass.    I don   t know. It just didn   t   maybe it made me mad.  It   s like,    I   ll show ya,    and I hope I did show her.  Wow. That was undoubtedly an experience in elementary school that  was formative. How about art experiences in middle school or high  school?  The first award I won was actually in Germany in the fourth grade. I  won a poster contest. Then the next time I really had any, that I really  noticed that I was probably better than most of the other kids in the class  was in seventh grade in Fort Smith, Arkansas. We had a tri-semester  where the school year was divided up into three, and one of those  semesters was in art. At that class I was if not the best artist, at least one  of the best artists in there. The next award I actually won was the ninth  grade in Lawton, Oklahoma, I won First Place in watercolor at a local  show that they had there.  7  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Then in high school I really lucked out. I had an outstanding art teacher,  Velma Bailey. She took about three, about five of us that were above-average  artists and really kind of gave us separate education from the  rest of the kids in the class. We entered competitions all over Oklahoma  and Texas. In art class we won numerous awards. My junior and senior  year in high school, I won First Place in architectural design, graphics.  The architectural design was through Central State College, I believe it   s  called, something, there in Edmond, Oklahoma. I think it   s a full  university now.  I remember it got to the point that some of the other schools weren   t  inviting us to come. (Laughs) Our class was just really doing well, and  we had a art club there that was called The Palette and Brush Club. My  senior year, I was the vice president of that organization. That was the  first time I actually entered a non-school competition. Cache Road  Square in Lawton had a spring art festival that year, and they had a  student section. I actually entered, and I won First Place in the drawing  competition that year out there in the open mall.  That   s wonderful. Were you already thinking of yourself as an artist?  No, my family really didn   t know what to do with me. I was not a good  student. My mind was always off on art, and the few teachers that  figured that out was able to use the art for me to proceed in their classes  at a passing level. Mom and Dad, neither one of them really could think  of anything to do with art. They were trying to push me into an  engineering or an architectural thing, and I actually ended up working  for an architectural and structural engineer my junior year in high school  after winning that First Place. I actually got a job offer. It was basically  the office flunky. You cleaned up, but you   re around it. That was a great  benefit for me because it introduced me to quality materials.  Up unto that point of time, art in high-school level, you didn   t have good  quality materials. I mean, you   re working with cheap watercolor  brushes, Tempera, newsprint, you know, stuff that   . When I got around  these architectural, and they were doing the presentations, and they were  using commercial products, airbrushing, illustration board, technical  drawing pens, and all this work, its reflection in work I do today is what  I learned in being around and actually doing some of that early technical  drawing and drafting work.  I   m sort of surprised in a way that your folks weren   t more open to the  idea of art, just because of maybe that European exposure, as well,  being in Germany. Do you think that impacted you at all?  Well, I   m not sure that that impacted me, but it was the military that did  8  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  because this is after World War II, 1953, 1954, 1955 in Germany. It   d  been, what, six years after the war had ended. Most enlisted men, which  my dad was a sergeant, most of our friends were military, were  sergeants. Going into their homes, and even today I think one of the  biggest impacts that is even reflected in my work today was early  exposure to Oriental work.  Even though we weren   t in the Orient, these other enlisted people were.  I remember being fascinated by some of these screen prints and block  prints from Japanese like Mount Fuji and stuff. If you really look at that  work, it   s the Trail of Tears. It   s Cherokee flat. It   s our traditional flat  style. They   re so parallel to it, so when I started doing the Native work, I  immediately drew back on the Oriental work. I think it shows in my  work a lot of times. I particularly like   I use a lot of what I call a  woodblock style, trees in my background. It   s a stylized tree that   s  influenced from that 1954,    55, early influence of this Oriental work.  Thanks for sharing that. What did you do after high school? What was  your path?  I was trying to follow my parents    wish to go into the technical or  drafting engineering. I went to Cameron  University  for a year. It just  didn   t work.  Cameron Junior College?  Yeah, it was a junior college at the time. That just didn   t really work out.  I decided to go in the Air Force. Had the highest entrance exam score  they   d ever had out of Oklahoma City, guaranteed any school I wanted  to. Got down to Lackland  Air Force Base , and they went,    You   re  color blind. You can   t go to any of those schools. What do you want to  be, a cook or an air policeman?    I said,    Give me a rifle.    Once I got out  of there, out of the service, I went down to Dallas and ended up working  as a tech illustrator. I didn   t even know what a tech illustrator was at the  time, but there was a manpower job shop. We called it job shopping  back then.  It was a contract-type labor where you actually weren   t working directly  for the company, but you were doing work with the company. I got into  the aerospace technical illustrations, and it combined that drafting and  technical background with this creativity that I   ve always had. It really  gave me my first time to express myself. I know there were times that  we weren   t allowed to get copies of what we had because it was all  secret work for the government, which was disappointing because there  were some really interesting things I did. One of the more interesting  pieces was a spy telescope for a satellite that was forty-two inches wide,  9  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  the drawing was, and it was seven feet long. (Laughs)  My goodness.  I remember I got real mad, though. After I did all the layout, I took a day  off and came back, and there was another illustrator ink in it. The artist  in me really came out because I blew up.  Because of the color blind deal or just     No, the fact that somebody else was inking my work. The color  blindness really didn   t apparently affect me at that time because it was  all black and white that we were dealing with. It was years later before I  ever tried to even do any color work.  While you were working, were you also doing some art on the side on  your own time?  Not at that time.  When did you start?  That time we were working, like, seventy-eight hours a week. You go  home and go to sleep; you go back and go to work. The fine art end of it  actually resulted because of the aerospace downturn. I was working out  in LA, and that was when Rolls Royce went bankrupt. The C-511  plane   a lot of the aircraft, the whole industry almost collapsed. I came  back to Oklahoma, ended up getting a job for the Oklahoma City  Planning Department, the head of their graphics art section, and had  thirteen people working for me. I had a lot of free time because I was  spending more time supervising than I was actually doing any work, and  that was the first time I actually remember having a close-up view of an  art show.  I looked out the window one spring, that first spring there in 1970, and  they were setting up the Festival of the Arts. I looked out the window  and I went, I asked them, I said,    What   s going on down there?    They  said,    That   s an art show.    I said,    Well, I can do that.    (Laughter) Of  course, as an artist, I hate hearing people come into the booth and say,     Well, I can do that.    Yeah, they can do it, but let them think of the idea  to do it. Anyway, I went down and walked through the art show, and I  was convinced I could it. I did my first art show later that spring out at  Shepherd Mall. No it was Penn Square Mall, excuse me, Penn Square  Mall. It was an open mall then, and I shared a booth with two other  artists that worked for me in there, and I dragged them out there. They  came kicking and screaming. That was my first introduction.  10  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  So your subject matter was     At the time I was doing pen-and-ink drawings. I actually started out  doing Victorian houses. It was just something that fascinated   I think it  goes back to the architectural background, the technical drawing  background the first year or so. I   ve always had a little twisted sense of  humor. I was also doing some little acrylic paintings and stuff, and I  remember that year I did an acrylic. I started out doing a painting of  World War I. I wanted to do a Baron  Manfred  Von Richthofen, the  Red Baron. I had the two planes in the sky. I had his Fokker Dr.1  triplane; I had the SPAD coming in over the top of him; and down below  I had the Australian troops, sitting there shooting up in the air at him. I  had everybody painted but the Australian pilot that was in the SPAD. I  sat there and started shaking my head. I said,    Don   t do it.    I did it: I put  Snoopy in it. (Laughter) People love things like that, when I start doing  my off-humor. That was my first phase at it.  When did you make the switch to full-time? You were already married, I  take it?  Right, I was married. We had two children. I was still working for the  City, Oklahoma City Planning Department. That next year, I ended up  doing twenty-five shows that next year, working full-time. We   d take  off, get off Friday evening. We   d do shows, like, in Austin, Texas. We   d  drive all night, get down there, I mean two or three in the morning, get  up, set up, tear down Sunday night, and drive back, and go to work.  Now, when you say    we    was this your family?  My wife would go with me. Seemed like there was always a group of us  traveling together, me and a couple other artists. It was always nice to  share rooms and share experiences of driving and things. We usually  ended up taking vehicles, but at thirty-five, forty cents a gallon, it wasn   t  that hard to drive a pickup that only got ten miles to the gallon.  Fortunately, I was young to be able to handle that. Unfortunately, I had a  lead foot, and I had been known to get to shows rather rapidly. During  that period of time, it was really hard. The Planning Department had a  change in leadership there in the City, (it was a typical political thing)  and I saw it as an opportunity to quit and go full-time.  At that point, I stopped, and went into it full-time, and continued doing  my pen-and-ink drawings. I started doing an Escher-influenced type  work because M. C. Escher was introduced to the United States about  that time. It was very similar to some things I had done, using positive  and negative use of space. I think it was about mid-1970s, probably  11  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  about    76, I had an oil man approach me. Wanted me to do an oil well  picture, and I went,    I don   t want to do a dirty old oil well.    He said     Come on,    and he kept on me. I said,    Okay, I   ll do it if I can do it the  way I want to.    I said,    I promise you it   ll be quality, but you have to  promise to buy it no matter what I do.    He went,    Okay.     Well, Oklahoma Crude movie had just been screened there in Oklahoma  City that year, and I remember there was an old cable tool rig with a  Model-T hooked up, powering the rig. I thought,    I want to show it as a  dry hole, just like in the movie where he didn   t hit oil at first.    I said,     Well, how do you do that?    I went to the library and went to the  geological section and found that there were seven basic geological  formations. The first one was a simple   it was just a little bump in the  earth, a salt dome or something pushing up where the oil collected at the  top. So I did the drawing of this drill drilling down, but I made it miss  the oil. He loved it, and the other oil men loved it. They kept getting me  to do things.  So you had commissions, your first commissions.  Oh, yeah, and the more sarcastic I got, the more they loved it. The best-selling  piece I ever did, I did 350 prints of it. It was a triptych, and it  sold out in three months. It was called The Good, the Bad and the  Greedy. Showed a good well; showed a guy missing a well; and the third  guy drilling over and stealing oil from the first guy. (Laughter) That  went on for quite a few years, and then 1980, probably    86, I got into a  situation where I was not getting into the shows that I   d been doing for  years. There were some political things that were causing it, and I  thought,    I   m going to just go back to my heritage and start doing Native  American work.    I run into Jean Bales at Arts for All that year, and she  was telling me about the Denver, Colorado, Indian Market. That was the  first Indian show I got into, in 1988. Went up there and had a really good  show.  How many pieces did you take?  Oh, gosh, I probably had no more than twelve or fifteen pieces.  Originals?  Prints. I had a few originals, but mostly prints. I   d got into prints at an  early age because I found out with my technical background, I knew  how to get, I had the commercial connections for printing and  everything. Doing my own black-and-white prints, I was actually doing  an aluminum etching back in the   70s and things. As the years went by,  I   d say most of my booth was prints with just a few originals.  12  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  So you had a good show there, and that sort of determined your  covering Native subjects.  Right. It was kind of a struggle at first because not growing up around  my own culture, exposed to the Kiowa and Comanche as well as the  Cherokee, it was kind of mixed bag there for a while.  You did some Plains images?  Oh, yeah. A lot of my work was influenced by so many of the artists. I  particularly liked the Kiowa Comanche flat style. The reason I liked it, it  was a technically controlled media. Being color blind, if I   m going to  work in color, I have to be able to control where that color goes through.  By using the flat colors, it was easy for my mind to relate to the colors.  During that same period of time, I decided to kind of deviate a little bit  from the traditional flat style. I wanted to introduce a full-color sky in  the background of a flat-style painting. Unfortunately, when I looked at  a sunset, I couldn   t tell what the colors were, so I had to get my wife and  my friends to tell me the colors in the sky.  I trained them to start at the horizon and go up at 10 percent intervals,  and tell me the colors they see. Of course, that really started by accident.  It was a comment my wife made one evening. We were driving out  West. She said,    Isn   t that a beautiful pink sunset?    I said,    It can   t be.     She said,    What do you mean,    it can   t be   ?    I said,    What color   s the  sky?    She said,    Blue.    I said,    What color   s the sun?    She said,     Yellow.    I said,    Any first-year art student knows that yellow and blue  is green. That   s a beautiful green sunset.    That   s really what got me  interested in doing the skies, and I think it   s worked quite well for me.  And you would find the paints with those colors?  Right. We started out really simple. We actually went to a poster store  there in Oklahoma City, and I picked out six or seven different posters  that had contemporary colors, Southwestern-type colors that was real  popular at the time. She helped pick. We narrowed it down to basically  five basic colors and black and white. Those colors, basically most of  my paintings are built around those primary design colors that I use. It   s  a very technical way to approach art, but it   s the only way I can handle  color.  That   s a neat technique there. What   s one award that you won in a  Native art show early on that was important to you?  Oh, gosh, there   s so many that   s been important to me. I think the one  13  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  that   s most important to me I haven   t gotten yet. It   s the Indian Arts and  Crafts Association, a national organization of artists. I have been a  runner-up eight times since 1988, and it frustrates me that I can   t win  Indian Artist of the Year. I think that   s probably the most important one  is the fact that I haven   t got it yet. I   m still trying. (Laughter)  Who were some of the Native artists that you admired or that you sort of  got to know as you started doing shows?  The early stages when I first started doing it, Rance Hood influenced  some of my work, as well as Barthell Little Chief, and then of course   I  hate it when I have a mind blank like that. Some of our Cherokee  traditional     Bill Rabbit?  Well, actually I didn   t know Bill or Donald Vann, either one. I   m talking  about the earlier ones that were working more in the flat style.  Cecil Dick, maybe?  Right. Their work influenced me. Of course, Donald and I, we have a lot  of the same colors and stuff in our skies. I think his work has always  interested me because of the sky techniques that he did. It took me a  while to find my own little niche because of the influence of everybody  and trying to develop your own technique. It   s worked quite well for me.  Did you ever run into prejudice, sort of?  Well, it   s kind of funny you brought that up. Of course, you can tell by  my complexion I look more white than I do Indian, so growing up, I  never had any prejudism, even staying there in Locust Grove. I didn   t  realize that there was prejudice against Indians, even at an early age. I  mean, my nickname was Snowball, but, you know, I didn   t ever think   .  The Indian kids weren   t being prejudiced in that aspect. It was just  something   we all had nicknames back then. I had white hair and pale  skin; why not be Snowball? That was a good nickname. It wasn   t until I  was an adult that I was out West and saw the prejudism against, and the  racism against the Pueblo people and the Navajo people in that region.  When I was doing art shows, and I first doing my Indian artwork, I was  traveling a lot. I was doing some mall shows, and we were traveling up  in Montana and Wyoming. That was the first time I actually ever had  prejudism of being an Indian that was directly against me that I actually  felt it. I was in Great Falls, Montana, and I   d walked away from my  booth, and a friend of mine was there, was watching my booth. I come  14  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  back, and he was talking to this couple there, obviously a well-to-do  rancher from the area. I didn   t want to interrupt the conversation because  I thought,    We might get a sale here,    you know.  I heard the conversation, and the guy says,    Well, is he Indian?    My  friend said,    Well, yeah, but you   re darker than he is.    The guy says,    It  doesn   t matter. I won   t buy from a damn Indian,    and he turned around  and walked off. I went,    Oh, my God.    That was the first time that I  actually felt that there was a prejudice. Sometimes out West, I   ve felt  almost a reverse prejudism from the other Native people because of our  mixed background. One of our Cherokee Treasures, potter, Mitchell,  what was her first   I can   t remember.  Anna.  Anna Mitchell, she said something that I got a kick out of one time. We  were at a meeting, and somebody had brought up the fact that Plains  Indians were making fun of us, the fact that we   d been intermarrying.  She got up, and she says,    I know these people. I show with them. You  know what? They   re marrying white people, too. In a hundred years, we  can laugh at them.    (Laughs) I loved it. I thought that was the greatest  comment on prejudism or reverse racism that I   ve ever heard.  What changes did you notice in the art scene starting in the   80s to the    90s?  I really lucked out. I came into the Indian arts and crafts business at a  very fortunate time. It was 1988 when I first really started doing full-time  as a Native artist. There in the   90s, we had Dances With Wolves  come out. They were filming The Last of the Mohicans, and everybody  was trying to trace their native roots, whether they were or not. It was  like a boom time, so that was a great period of time.  Of course, 9/11 actually stopped that boom. It was just like  snaps , and  we haven   t recovered from it yet. Native American artwork is still just,  we   re struggling. I see the jewelers seem to be doing a little bit better,  which is always a good sign because they always recover. My  observation is they always recovered faster than two-dimensional work.  If we can get the women starting wearing Indian jewelry again, they   ll  start buying Indian artwork again to go with their jewelry.  Sometimes the business part of art is the trickiest to figure out. It kind of  seems like you did that with the non-Native subject matter, but how did  you deal with the business side of doing Native art?  Fortunately, the business end of it really wasn   t that much different. That  15  Little Thunder  Mitchell  is probably one of the hardest things for an artist to do. It   s alien to us,  for us to do it. I mean, that   s completely opposite from the creative end  of it. I   ve been told that I do it quite well. I learned at an early period in  my art career that galleries, dealers, all of this is an important part of our  system, and I always tried to have a good association with my art  galleries, with wholesalers, and dealers, and wholesale markets.  I actually even opened a little art gallery in Oklahoma City for about a  year, which gave me   I never made any money at it, but it gave me an  insight into the problems that the gallery owners have. A lot of the artists  can   t comprehend why we have the pay the gallery owners so much  money. Their overhead makes ours look puny. Their advertising cost  alone sometimes equals our show budget, and a lot of times they really  aren   t making that much off of us. I agree that it seems that way, but you  also have to design your artwork so you can wholesale.  There   s a lot of artists out there that are wholesaling to the public, and  they can   t wholesale to the gallery because they don   t understand the  cost of materials and cost of goods. When you design a product, you  have to have it so you can wholesale it and still make a profit. If you  can   t, then you got to find another product. I   ve been fortunate that I   m a  very versatile person. I can change quickly. I   ve changed styles  numerous times over the years. I   ve done sculpture work. I   ve done  paintings. I do pen-and-ink drawings. I feel very fortunate that I can do  this. I have to be careful and not do too much of it. The public has a hard  time accepting that we can do more than one thing.  You   ve done some really creative, I think, presentations, also, of prints.  I   m thinking that I remember seeing the mat work and things that were     do you cut your own mats?  I do, right. I do all my own matting and framing. When the computer  mat cuts first started coming out, that really challenged me. I felt that I  could hand-cut a mat not near as quick but just as creative, and I came  up with some very interesting pieces. I caught myself going,    Wait a  minute. I   m spending as much or more time on these silly mats as I did  the original. There   s got to be a point of stopping,    but it was fun to do  those for a while. The latest thing that I   ve been doing with my framing  is a technique that I came up with about a year ago in my pen-and-ink  drawings.  I   m actually introducing a dimensional element in the framed pieces. I  actually do the pen-and-ink drawing or an ink and watercolor piece.  Then I cut a mat. Then I put a piece of glass over that mat and do  another drawing, and then put another mat over that, and then frame it  with another glass over it. What happens is that outer glass reflects all  16  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  your reflections away, and the inner glass disappears so all you have is  this drawing, floating above the existing drawing.  I think we   re going to get to look at one of those here in a minute.  It   s a challenging technique, but I get bored easy, and I love to challenge  myself. (Laughter)  In 1990 the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed, requiring artists to  have proof of enrollment or a letter from their tribe, certifying that they  could represent that tribe as an artist. Do you remember how that  impacted galleries and individuals?  Well, that act actually was just a redetermination of an earlier act passed  in the 1930s. It did impact some people who did not or could not prove  their heritage. That   s unfortunate, but laws generally, as we know in this  country, are made for the majority of the people. I was fortunate that my  family had always maintained our tribal ties and that it was quite easy  for me to prove my heritage. I   ve had a lot of discussions with other  people that unfortunately couldn   t prove their heritage. What they  couldn   t, or at least the way I perceived it, is they could not   that it   s a  political thing, not a race thing.  When I   m a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, that means just like  someone would be citizen of France or a citizen of Germany. It doesn   t  mean that they   re not German or French or English anymore. It just  means that they   re not a citizen. Because of the fraudulent practices that  were coming in from out of the country, these laws and stuff had to be  strengthened in order to protect our Native history and culture, or they  would not exist anymore.  Any good artist, (I firmly believe this) if they want to be an artist, they  don   t have to be. Even if I couldn   t prove I was Native American, I   d  still be out there doing art. I still could do Native American artwork. I  just couldn   t claim it was done by a Native American. I probably would  have changed my subject and gone into something contemporary or  something else, but I think a good, creative artist, that shouldn   t limit  them.  What   s been one of the best comments or responses you   ve gotten when  you   ve been showing your art?  Oh, gosh, I think generally when they find out that I   m red-green  colorblind, it   s difficult for them to comprehend how I perceive things  and how it actually comes about. I always think that, Then anytime  anybody identifies the Oriental influence of my work, I always love that.  17  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  I mean, that is probably the best compliment you can give me is that     Gee, that kind of reminds me of Oriental work,    because of that early  influence.  That stylization.  Right.  I think one new vein you   ve been exploring recently is what you call  contemporary ledger art, where you   re using old pages from the  Cherokee Phoenix or old Cherokee maps and then doing figures on  them. Can you talk about how you got that idea?  Well, that idea actually started on my way back from a show back East.  Me and John Guthrie were coming back to Oklahoma together. We were  sitting there talking about, just feeding ideas off of each other, and we  were trying to think of a new way to do the Trail of Tears, a different  way that hadn   t been done.  That specific category you   re talking about     Right.     at the Trail of Tears art show.  We were talking about  Andrew  Jackson, who was responsible for the  Trail of Tears, and the twenty dollar bill, the fact that Jackson   s picture  was on it. I came up with the idea of incorporating the Trail of Tears on  a twenty dollar bill. I enlarged the twenty dollar bill up, which is legal as  long as it   s not, you know, and then I did a painting of the Trail of Tears  at the bottom of it. It was called Jackson   s Legacy. That was the first  contemporary ledger piece that I did because it wasn   t done in the  traditional Plains style ledger, but still it was done on a document.  It   s been so well received. As a matter of fact, it was bought by the  Indian Museum in Wichita, Kansas, as part of their permanent  collection. The original actually has the twenty dollar bill in it. That was  an interesting story in itself because I wanted a twenty dollar bill to tie in  to the Trail of Tears. I went to coin shop after coin shop, trying to find a  twenty dollar bill that was printed back in 1835, or something from  Tahlequah, or something from Chattanooga, or something. Finally, this  one coin dealer says,    If you found something like that, it would be  extremely rare and very, very expensive.     I was really disheartened. I was going,    I   m just not going to find a  twenty like I want.    I was walking out of the store, and this twenty  18  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  dollar bill   you   ve heard of that where something will reach out and  grab you? Something grabbed my attention, and I turned around and  walked back into the store. I looked at this twenty, and I went,    Oh, my  God.    It was issued in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1935.  Eighteen thirty-five or nineteen thirty-five?  Nineteen thirty-five. That was the hundredth anniversary of the first law  the State of Georgia passed against the Cherokees that led to the Trail of  Tears. Later I found out it was the first year that Jackson had been put on  a twenty. All of that came   that was my twenty, and that   s what really  started it. I started looking at these other documents, trying to see how I  could do it. Of course, going back to that little satirical humor that I  developed back in the oil boom days, I naturally had to start injecting  that into it. The Declaration of Independence, wow, here   s another one  for the Trail of Tears. The Constitution, influenced by Native people,  Franklin and Jefferson both said it was influenced by Natives; there   s  another one.  There   s document after document. I keep finding them going,    Wow,  how can I incorporate this?    About a year ago, the Cherokee Nation  commissioned several artists to do guitars, paint guitars. Well, there was  no way to transfer a document to that guitar. I tried. I tried decoupaging  the Declaration on it, and it just didn   t work. I ended up hand-painting a  copy of a Revolutionary War map on there with two Cherokees on it, on  the map. That   s kind of the first time that I actually had to do my own  document. Now there   s several of them that I   ve done recently, that I   ve  actually had to do my own document.  Now, was this a casino commission?  This was, yeah, it was for the Hard Rock Casino there. That guitar is in  the permanent collection there in the, not the cafeteria, one of the  restaurants. (Laughs)  Right. I   m going to have to look for that. (Laughs) You publish an online  newsletter, I noticed, which involves writing as well as design work and  layout. How did you get the idea to do a newsletter?  I   ve been, I   ve tried several different communication ways with the  digital age. I had to learn to use the computer to do my own printing. I  didn   t like Facebook or any of those social medias because, one reason, I  just really don   t have time to deal with the pettiness of a lot of that, but I  wanted a way of communicating to my customers and to the other  people around me what I was doing and what was going on. Now,  previously in the   70s and   80s, I   d put out brochures or updated little  19  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  flyers that I   d send out occasionally. It was basically a hard-copy  newsletter. Well, I came up with the idea of doing a digital. Ideally, I   d  love to do it every month. Unfortunately, like this last time, it was three  months before I got around to doing it, but I had six paintings I had to  get out for the Cherokee Nation. I got six commissions for paintings for  their Veterans Center, and I just got those finished up. That was the main  subject matter of this last newsletter. (Laughs)  Well, congratulations on that.  Thank you.  You won First Place in 2012 in the Trail of Tears category, I guess, at  the Cherokee Museum Art Show     Yes.     and you   ve won a lot of awards. Does that change the feeling when  you win?  When I first started out in the   70s, awards were very important to me as  a young artist. Oh, that was a heck of an ego booster. Sometime during  those years, making money was more important to me because it was the  only source of income our family had, and the awards really took a back  seat. It was until just recently, actually after I moved back over here into  the Cherokee Nation, had a lot of life-changing situations that had  happened, that I got interested   well, I had a heart attack last year. It  really, kind of a wake-up call. I ended up with triple-bypass, and I really  cut back on my show schedule a lot. It   s not that important for me to be  making money anymore. I mean, we all need to make money, but I   m  comfortable with my income that I have now. Making money at the  shows isn   t as important, so I find myself again, full circle, back to the  beginning again, excited about the competitions. Now the pieces are  more inspired by trying to come up with something unique to compete  with, rather than come up with something that will sell.  That   s neat. Well, let   s talk about your process and techniques a little bit  more. Do you work with, in terms of your originals when they   re not  pen-and-inks, when they   re paintings, are they primarily gouache, or a  mixture of gouache and ink, or are they acrylic paintings?  I work in all three medias. I do pen-and-inks; I do a mixed-media of ink  and watercolor; I do gouache; and I do acrylics. The gouache and the  watercolors and the acrylics are done using that flat style, but I also use a  lot of airbrush techniques in my work. You   ll see a lot of hard-edge  work in it that resembles stencil work. That   s actually one-of-a-kind  20  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  stencil done for that airbrush, that I actually do right on top of the  painting. I actually hand-cut it out with an X-Acto knife, so it   s unique  one-of-a-kind stencil work using the airbrush. I started using the airbrush  when I started doing my skies to get the cloud effects and everything.  Right, and you mentioned that you   ve tried your hand at sculpture?  Yeah, I   ve always loved three-dimensional work. Even back in the early  days, I played with some polymer clay sculptures back in the   70s, just  some little miniatures. It was more just an exercise to relax my mind  from the two-dimensional because a lot of my work is so technical it  really becomes intricate, mentally consuming. Working with the  sculpture kind of relaxes me, and it gives me another direction to go  with this creative work. When I was living in Prague, a friend of mine  was a welder. He broke his leg and couldn   t work full-time anymore.  He   d done a few little craft shows with just some little basic cut-out steel  stuff. I approached Harold   he   s a Seminole. I approached him, and I  said,    Harold, I   ve got these three-dimensional ideas. I   ll work with you  with this. You do the metal work. I   ll give you the ideas. I   ll show you.     We worked side-by-side there for a while. He was using a plasma torch  to cut the pieces out and everything. One day I designed this piece that  he just couldn   t grasp. It was a positive-negative space, and he couldn   t  grasp negative space. He was messing it up, and I said,    Give me that  torch  It looks like a big clumsy airbrush. I can do that.    He kind of  warned me a little bit, but he stepped back, and I started cutting out. He  looked at me, and he says,    I   ve never seen anybody just pick up a torch  and start cutting like that.    I said,    It   s just like this big clumsy airbrush,  except I   ve got to remember not to put my hand there to shade it, to  block some of the torch out with.    That   s really how I got into doing the  metal work, and fortunately worked with Harold for quite a few years.  Are these the source of some of the lamps?  Lamps and some of the war shields that we did. Then I actually did, the  last pieces I did, I did a wood base like a pedestal and built the sculpture  on it, so it was a free-standing metal work. The reason that was done is  when you enter into competition, if you enter a wall piece that   s metal,  they lay it on a table because they don   t have hanging space for the  metal. It just doesn   t show the work off, so I came up with this idea that  was,    I   ll just build my own wall     (Laughs) I tried easels at first, but  they wouldn   t, you know, that was clumsy. When I downsized and  everything, I had to give up my metal work. I do have plans to start  picking up and doing the polymer clay sculptures again. Like I said, it   s  a nice diversion from doing all that real technical-type work.  21  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  How important is preliminary sketching to your work?  Oh, gosh, that   s the basis. Drawing is the basis to all art. I go through  tons of tracing paper. I approach it much like a commercial artist does.  I   ll do a rough layout; I   ll overlay it, clean it up. I   ll overlay that overlay.  I keep making overlays of previous overlays until I come up with a final  layout. Because my work is so technical, you   ve got to know where  everything is going to go before you start. You can   t just randomly  approach a piece and let the color dominate your direction and  everything, composition. You   ve got to plan it all out. Now, I realize  some artists work quite well the other way. I don   t.  What kinds of research do you do for your paintings?  Historical research is very important to me. I try not to make historical  mistakes. I   ve made a few over the years, and it   s made me more  observant on these things. As a matter of fact, Allan Houser, well-known  sculptor, actually pointed out a mistake to me in I think it was    89, I  believe. I was doing a show in Albuquerque, and I didn   t recognize him.  He walked up to my booth. I was set up in front of Sheplers there in  Albuquerque, New Mexico, and this little, short Indian comes up to me  and starts talking to me. We   re talking for a quite a while, and he  pointed out a little mistake I made. I said,    Oh, do you do artwork?    and  he says    Oh, I dabble in it.    As he walked away, all of a sudden I  realized who it was, too late  It was Allan Houser of all people     Do you  do any artwork?       Oh, I dabble in it.    (Laughs)  That was great, but in a way that was kind of embarrassing, too. He was  so nice about it. He could have really made an issue about it. It   s  important to me. I have a small library of research books that I   ve  purchased over the years. Of course, now I use the computer to go online  sometimes when I run into   my daughter keeps reminding me when I  come up with some idea or something, she says,    Well go online.    I  went,    Oh, yeah     I still think you have to go to the library, you have to  go to a book. It   s like recently one of the questions, a technical question,  that   s been bothering me for a long time, I   ve inquired several times  trying to find the origin of why the Cherokees started wearing turbans.  This question that I was asking is where the turbans originated from.  I   ve got some theories, but I have not substantiated those theories.  They started wearing them there in the late 1700s, early 1800s. That was  after the Cherokees had been taken to England and introduced into the  court as royalty. At that time, England was a world power, and they  would have had representatives from around the world, including people  from India and Africa who would   ve worn turbans. Or because we were  slave owners, some of the African slaves that we would have owned  22  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  would have worn turbans. Those are two possibilities that would have  influenced it. I would like to think it was the English court, but I have  not found any documentation to prove otherwise. My daughter said,     Well, go online and find out,    which I haven   t done yet, but I will.  (Laughs) Little things like that. It   s the curiosity of    why    sometimes.  You   ve kind of touched on why veterans themes are important to you,  too, but I wonder if there   s any more to say on that.  Yes, this was a good opportunity that came up recently when the  Cherokee Nation opened a competition to get commissions for the new  Veterans Center. I   m a US Air Force veteran. I was in there in    63 to     65. My dad was a World War II veteran. He   d actually gone into the  Army in 1938. He was in the Battle of Dutch Harbor, which was when  Japan attacked Wake Island, the Battle of Midway there. Not Wake  Island. It was the Battle of Midway. They actually had a diversionary  attack, and Dad   s company, they had one company up there at Dutch  Harbor. That was the only thing between Japan and the United States.  The stories he   s told me about that   . Matter of fact, I   ve been working  on a project for the last couple of years. Hopefully, I get to work on it  again this year. The story of my dad at Dutch Harbor is a graphic novel  I   m working on. Hopefully when it gets completed, I   ll present it over  there to our Veterans Center. Maybe they   ll include a copy of the book  in there.  Neat. You mentioned humor in your work, and a lot of times I   ll find  humor in some of your titles. How do you come up with your titles?  Titles are probably the most interesting things to come up with.  Generally the titles are after the paintings. I know a lot of people come  up with the subject matter and titles at first, but mine usually come at the  end. One of my most popular sources of titles are movies. During the oil  boom days, I used a lot of Clint Eastwood titles. High Plains Driller.  Drifter became the High Plans  Driller . The Good, the Bad and the  Ugly became The Good, the Bad and the Greedy. A Few Dollars More,  A Fistful of Dollars.  Today I use a lot of music. I   ll go through record albums, going through  their names and stuff because when you   ve been doing shows and  artwork as long as I have, you hate to keep using the same titles. As a  Cherokee, we are guilty of doing a lot of Trail of Tears pieces, (I fully  admit that, at least I am) but how many of them can you keep calling  Trail of Tears? It   s always trying to, okay,    How can I call this the Trail  of Tears but not call it   with a new twist on the same name?    It   s  always a challenge like that. But music, I   ll go through those music  titles, and a lot of times I   ll come up with,    That   s a good title. Now how  23  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  can I tie this into my painting?    (Laughs)  You have a really elaborate signature, actually, because it   s the  Oklahoma flag, as I understand it, the logo, but you add your initials or  your full name to it.  Yeah, that grew over the years. My family name is Foreman, and when I  first started doing shows, I did four little horsemen, four men. Well, on  my mother   s side is Rainwater, which is another Cherokee family, but  our side of the Rainwaters quit being Cherokee in the 1900s because  they stayed in Georgia too long, not by choice, but, you know. I had this  little raincloud above these four horsemen, rainwater. I kept elaborating  on it, and it is influenced a lot by the Oklahoma flag seal. It does  resemble that quite a lot. The circle around it represents the circle or  unity of the family or tribe, so I set the four horsemen inside this circle  representing the tribe. The shield itself is a seven-sided shield  representing the seven-sided Council House of the Cherokee Nation, so  now I have the four men, the family and a tribe, and the Council House.  But my work is influenced by the Plains flat style, so I put a flat style, a  Plains flute on it, and I hang seven feathers, representing the seven clans  of the Cherokee Nation. That developed over about five years.  And it   s a mini-painting.  Yes.  What is your creative process from the time you get an idea?  The idea development takes considerably longer than the painting. I   m a  rather fast painter or illustrator because basically a lot of my work is  illustrations, but it   s the idea and putting it into a two-dimensional form.  That   s the most time-consuming thing. A lot of times it just starts with  an abstract thought or concept, or sometimes it   s just out of the blue like  the twenty dollar bill inspiring that one piece. Like a lot of creative  people, the solutions to these concepts happens early morning. There   s  been numerous times that I   ve solved my problem in my sleep. I wake  up at three or four in the morning, and the idea   s there. I have to get up  and write down how I solved that particular problem.  Sometimes it   s just a smart remark another person   s made. A few years  ago, I was working on a piece, a transitional piece. I wanted to show an  Eagle Dancer changing to an eagle. That transitional phase where the  two images overlap each other is probably the most difficult part of that  type of work. I was having a real difficult time solving it. An artist  friend of mine, she said,    Why don   t you just put the rear-end of the  eagle on his face?    She was just being facetious, trying to be a little  24  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  smart aleck. She walked away. I looked at it, and, by God, it solved the  problem. If you see the final painting, you   ll see that basically his head  is where the eagle   s butt is. (Laughter)  What   s your creative routine? Do you paint more during the day, at  night?  I   ve trained myself to be more of a daytime painter. I know when I first  started, it was more of a evening. I seemed to work best, like, from one  or two in the afternoon to midnight. Now my most productive time is if I  can get started in the morning. If I can   t get started, it   s hard for me to  start anytime during the day. Now, once I get started, I can work ten,  twelve, fourteen hours, but maybe this has to do with age, too. (Laughs)  I wake up earlier now than I used to and go to bed earlier, so it   s a good  thing I can paint earlier in the morning now.  Looking back on your career so far, what was a fork-in-the-road  moment for you where you might have gone one way but you went  another?  Probably the Air Force. If they had put me into something that would  have utilized my artistic abilities instead of sticking me in the air police,  I probably would   ve made a career out of the Air Force, but fortunately  they stuck me in that, which caused me to take that other road, that  eventually led down to technical illustration to that job in Oklahoma  City, that led the Oklahoma City Arts Festival, that led to this.  What   s been one of the low points of your career?  Well, being in it for forty-two years is those recessions. I   ve gone  through several recessions, and the last one is the most devastating. It  was probably the most devastating because not only did, financially, I  lose a lot, my wife passed away. I had a heart attack. It was a  combination of a lot of negative things. Of course, the positive thing is,  is now I   m living back in the Cherokee Nation. I   m doing what I love to  do, and I   m not under any financial pressures that I have to get out there  and sell something. Those negatives do   but it makes a stronger person  out of you, I believe.  How about a high point?  Oh, the high points, gosh. I guess one of the first ones was my first  thousand-dollar show. It was 1973, the Kansas City Plaza Show. I did a  little over eleven hundred dollars. In 1973, that   s a lot of money. I  remember my wife and I got back to the motel. We were pulling   of  course, back then, the most expensive piece I had in the booth was  150,  25  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  so we were selling a lot of ten- and twenty-dollar items. We had a bed  pile of tens and twenties on this bed. It looked like we were rich, and we  felt like we were rich. (Laughter) How easy that thousand dollars now  wouldn   t amount to a hill of beans, but that was probably one of the  most wonderful feelings.  Recognition by your peers, by the public, that   s always just, is so good.  We   ve got to have our egos stroked once in a while. Those awards. The  ultimate compliment, I   ve always said, is when you buy a piece of  artwork from me, is that you take your hard-earned money and you   re  actually doing something that I   ve sat there and painted. Sometimes it  amazes me that people will do that (Laughs) because I   ll go home and  paint it. I won   t pay somebody money   I shouldn   t say that. I   ve bought  other artwork over the years when they wouldn   t trade. (Laughter)  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about before we look at a couple  of examples of your work, anything we forgot to mention?  Oh, gosh, so much happened over the last forty-two years, it   d be hard  for me to try to single out any one item during that period of time. I  think we   ve hit on the highlights of it. That   s all I think we could hope to  do. Otherwise, we   d have to get a lot longer film. It   d make a motion  picture out of it.  Okay, we   re going to pause here a moment and get your work set up. So  what would you like to share with us about your sculpture here?  This is a polymer clay sculpture that   s a low-fired clay. This was done a  few years ago. This is media that I   m going to start working in again.  This is about nine inches tall, and it   s of Da Tsi (Tah Chee)  Carpenter .  He was also known as    Dutch.    He came with his parents to Indian  Territory after the War of 1812 and became basically an Indian fighter  and guide. He fought the Kiowas, the Comanches. He became a really  skilled fighter and later led different military expeditions all over  Oklahoma. He became one of our Cherokee leaders after the Trail of  Tears, too, because he actually worked with the new people when they  came. That   s one of the first pieces I did with this much detail in it.  Yes, it   s got wonderful detail. And how about this piece?  Okay, this is a gouache painting of Osceola, famous Seminole war chief.  He fought during the Seminole wars and resisted the Trail of Tears. It  was the beginning   I   d set out to do a series of warriors from each one  of the Five Civilized Tribes. Unfortunately, I   ve never got around to the  other four yet, but that gives me something to do in the future. This was  using airbrush and dry brush techniques. You can see the background is  26  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  Mitchell  Little Thunder  using that airbrush technique, where I use the trees in a very simple  form, a block printing type element, then use the dry brush technique  and the flat style in the figure where I do all the detail work.  Right. That   s really nice.  He   s real famous for that, supposedly stabbing a knife into the treaty in  rejection. I wanted this knife to be a three-dimensional effect instead of  actually going where he   s shoving it right in your face instead of down  on the table like it would really historically happen. I took a few liberties  with history here on this one.  Right. (Laughs) Well, thank you for your time today.  You   re welcome. We didn   t talk about role playing.  We didn   t. Do you want to add that as a post script?  Yeah  When I first started doing art shows, the public intimidated me a  little bit, I suppose, or maybe I was just a little bit on the bashful side. I  decided that   I don   t know that it was a conscious decision, but I role-played.  I started assuming a figure, highly influenced by The High  Plains Drifter. The Clint Eastwood movie was out. The black hat, the  long black   . I had a black duster custom made for one of the shows that  I   d gone to, so I started wearing all black. I had dark tinted glasses and  this black hat. I   d walk around with a real stern face because I just didn   t  really know how to react. One example is I was walking through one of  my early shows in this all-black outfit, and three women that knew me  real well, they went,    Ronny, smile      I turned around. I went,    Damn it, I am smiling.    Of course, I had to get  around the corner real quick because I cracked up laughing. (Laughter)  The reaction I got from them was great, so I just kept creating this  character until one day I woke up and I realized,    Wait a minute. I am  him     I wasn   t creating somebody. I was letting him out of the box. This  character that I thought I was creating was real me. So now today I no  longer have to use those props like the cowboy hat, the dark glasses, the  dark black. I   ve still got dark clothes on, but   . I   m comfortable relating  to people, but those early days, that really helped me a lot to be able to  communicate. Once I figured it out, it was,    Wait a minute. They   re on  my turf. I   m in control here, not them.    Then it was a lot easier for me to  talk with the public.  Well, thank you for sharing that story.  -------  -------  27
