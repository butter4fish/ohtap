 Finchum  Horning  Today is May 9, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University Library and we   re conducting an oral history project  entitled Spotlighting Oklahoma. Today we   re focusing on the 1930s.  We   re here in Stillwater, Oklahoma interviewing Monta Horning. Thank  you for joining us today. Let   s start with having you tell us a little bit  about your childhood, where you were born, and then we   ll work our  way forward.  Well I was born on a farm just outside of Wakita, Oklahoma. I went to  grade school in a one room school house. And then to high school in  Wakita. So all the rest of that was just kind of living during the  Depression or the Dust Bowl days. There   s a lot of stuff in between  there.  It   s a small town?  Yes, about 500 probably is the best it ever got, I think.  And what did your family do?  They were farmers. They moved to Wakita from Missouri in 1922, I  believe. And so my other five brothers and sisters were born in Missouri  and then when they came to Oklahoma two more were born.  So there were seven total?  Yes.  And do you remember when you started first grade?  I remember, it yes. Because I was only five or not quite five and they let  me go early to get out of the house maybe, I don   t know  Back then you  5  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  could send kids with other older kids. And so I went that one year and  then the next year I went to the same grade again. That was all eight  grades in one little room. See we had one room.  About how many students?  Oh, I imagine at the top there were about 30.  All eight grades?  Yes.  And what did your father do for a living?  He was a farmer and also a carpenter, so that filled in a lot of times that  he could carpenter and make money.  When he farmed, what was his product?  Wheat farmer. Yes, that was back when you didn   t make   if you got ten  bushels per acre, it was very good.  So when the Depression hit you would have been about...  I think 10-ish. Well according to when you think it hit. I mean in 1929  my dad bought a brand new 1929 Chevrolet car. We took a trip to  Colorado and down into Mexico, so things were good up until that point.  And then all of a sudden the crash came along and the Depression. The  stock market failed and somehow everything went down hill from there.  It never did get back until even after the war, actually. People didn   t  have anything. And in our case, I guess we were lucky because Mama  liked to have a garden and things like that so we could always eat. And  otherwise, you know if you were in the cities, it was probably  devastating because those people didn   t have a garden or didn   t have  work. And soup lines and things you heard about. But in our case we  never noticed that part of it.  But between that   like in    33, I was about ten by then. I think that   s  when the Dust Bowl   my folks always said, if it hadn   t been for the  Dust Bowl and the Depression at the same time, they would have been a  lot better off. Because the dirt   there was a drought for I don   t know  how many, five years maybe there, so actually those two together made  it harder and harder on the farmers. That   s when a lot of those guys  moved out and went to California or just moved away. But we were kind  of on the edge of the worst part of the dust and so forth. But it was very  hard. My mom always worked so hard and Papa did too. I always said  6  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  on Saturdays Papa   s job was to sharpen his saw, cut the boys hair off,  sole shoes and sharpen tools that he had to have. And carpenter a little  bit for Mama because she was always thinking up something to do in the  house.  I   ll have to tell you this story. One time Papa was in the barn and Mama  was always nagging at him to tear out a wall in between the kitchen and  a pantry. And she just said it so many times I guess but she went to the  barn and told him,    Tom, I   d really like to have that out.    He just quit  milking the cow, got up, went to the shop, got an ax, went in the house  and just started chopping this wall down. And Mama had to   everything  on the walls to cook with, pans, and she was trying to take that all off.  But anyway, he was a good carpenter and he always tried to please her.  We always laughed about that.  Well talk a little bit more about the house.  Well we had an old house. When we first got there, that was a terrible  time because there was a snow that was so high that folks had to come to  Medford, which is about 11-12 miles away over the fields. I mean the  snow was so deep and they had someone come and get them in a sled,  their car had failed in Missouri somewhere and they got on a train and  came this way. These people whose house they were supposed to move  into, they couldn   t leave, so all my family had to stay in there with them  in a three room house for a month or so until the weather got better.  They had two kids and there were seven of ours. So you can imagine  what that was like. But anyway, these people finally moved away and  we had a house then. But then, in just a little while Papa bought a house  up in Kansas and moved it to this location. It was a two story house, so  we had a bigger house then.  How   d he come to pick that spot to move to from Missouri?  Okay, well that was a miracle almost because my uncle, Uncle Forest, he  was in the post office in Wakita and he got this   well first this guy came  up to him, Mr. Boyles, and said,    Hey you don   t happen to know  somebody who wants a farm? My guy who was going to lease my land  backed out on me.    At the same time Uncle Forest had got a note from  Papa and said,    Would you possibly find some land out there for me to  farm?    So at that very moment he just turned around and wrote him  again and said come on out. It was in September so they had to hurry up  and get the wheat in. Mama was pregnant and she said,    You better get  back here by September 25th.    He got home that very day and Ralphie  was born that night. But I always think that was so funny when Papa  came to Mama earlier and said,    Would you like to starve to death in  Missouri or Oklahoma?    Cause it was so bad down there.    It couldn   t  7  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  get much worse,    Mama said. Anyway they moved out there and later  bought the place from this same old guy that owned it.  And for heat, did you use wood or coal?  Coal mostly. We had one of those great big round pot-bellied stoves.  Burn in the front and freeze behind you.  Did that become an issue in the    30s then? Did you have trouble getting  coal?  Oh yes, yes, it really was. Well the trouble with it was, we had a big  farm before. Like Papa had oh maybe 100 or so pigs and always had  about 500 chickens they   d raise and about 20 milking cows, so that was  a big thing. A lot of stuff going on. But when the drought came, we had  to sell a lot of animals to get rid of them because you couldn   t feed  them. And the cows, you couldn   t hardly get milk out of them so my  brother and I would graze them up and down the highway   or not a  highway, just a road   for the grass or weeds or something. But that was  just before we had to sell them all. We didn   t have any feed for them. So  that was really probably the worst.  And then right at that same time, I don   t know what year that was, but  the grasshoppers came and just took over the whole place. It was so  thick   we had a front porch, a cement porch, and you had to take a  scoop shovel and get them off the porch every day. They   d get on every  post. They   d eat the post and just anything they could get. They stayed  there probably weeks. I don   t know how many weeks. The hogs  wouldn   t even eat them anymore. We   d usually feed them to the hogs,  fill the wheel barrow and take them down for them to eat.  And then one time we got hailed out. The whole farm got hailed out.  And then another year the wheat just didn   t come up, period. Just too  dry. So there were four years that really nothing. Mama said that was the  hardest four years probably because they just didn   t have anything. And  then the dirt in the house got so bad. Upstairs the flooring went just so  far and then a space that was open. So we had to get up there with a  scoop and buckets and scoop that dirt out every so often so it wouldn   t  weight down the edges. It was so dirty. One thing I know about dirt, we  had to walk two miles to school so the wind would just beat your legs  off, you know, it was so windy. That dirt would hit your legs and I can  almost feel it. And then it   d get in your mouth and be gritty. Time you   d  get home your mouth   and you didn   t dare hardly open your mouth or  your eyes and try to walk. I just thought of that last night.  It was two miles from your house to school?  8  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Yes.  It took you at least 30 minutes, then.  Well we didn   t have electricity or we didn   t have a bus or anything. All  through high school I walked to school and it was a mile and a quarter.  And you know what happened too, cars started failing. You couldn   t  afford to buy any kind of windshields that had broke or a door that  needed to be fixed or whatever for a car. So that 1929 went clear through  my high school year probably. It was just that you couldn   t buy any  more. In fact one time my dad went to the bank. He wanted  25 to put  out a new crop and they wouldn   t loan it to him. He didn   t have enough  collateral. I think about banking now. But, you know, it was tough on  them.  I just admire my folks so for getting through all that. One thing about  them though, they were very cheerful. I mean, positive attitude. Papa  was more negative than Mama , but they played cards in the evening  with friends or they made ice cream on Sundays. They always had things  they did. Played croquet, or just had good times. They square danced or  had house parties. People would play violins or guitars and I   d play  piano sometimes. Everybody would throw their rugs back or shine up  their floor. And dance a lot of times, you know. So that got them through  a lot of those hard times, being able to have fun.  While they were doing that, what were the children doing?  Eating bologna sandwiches, sneaking them out of the kitchen. No, we   d  just play outside. There   s all kinds of things you played, hide and seek or  whatever, outside while that was going on.  Kick the can?  No, we didn   t even know that yet. I was thinking about it yesterday,  when I was thinking in the night I thought about toys that we didn   t   we  didn   t have any toys, of course. The boys would think up things. And  one of the things that made me laugh was we   d have an old tire and in  the day time we   d make mud balls and dry them and put them in those  tires and make it rattle. We   d push those things clear to school, the two  miles  And then we also had little long sticks about a yard long and then  they had a little end that you nailed on. And you had a little hoop, a  metal hoop. You   d run that, and run those things to school like as if we  didn   t have anything else to do. Go to school and take the tire and take  the hoop with us  I   d forgotten all about that until last night.  And I   m assuming you had to take your lunch or did they have     9  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Yes, we had lunches. And we had to take ours in a syrup budget. One  person had a nice, nice dinner bucket. And my sister married him so we  always talked about the dinner bucket. Old Dwight had the best dinner  bucket. His mother spoiled him. Mama would have left over biscuits and  we would put purple or grape jelly in that and that was part of our lunch  half the time. And it would get purple by the time noon  came around   so nobody wanted our lunch. We   d try to trade them, but nobody wanted  them. But anyway it was okay. And we   d go to Belle Plain, Kansas  sometime in the summer there and get apples and put them down in the  cellar. They   d all dry up and look terrible but we   d always get the apple  anyway.  Eat those in your lunch, too? Dried apples?  Yes. It wasn   t dried, it was just wrinkled up. Pre-dried.  Well, then what about clothes? With seven of you to     Oh Mama sewed constantly. She made dresses for everybody. And you  know even until I was a senior in high school, nobody had regular   store  bought clothes because they had to have this. And the boys were  still wearing overalls even then. So that was like    41, so actually this  whole thing started back here in like    29 to    41. It was a long period of  nobody having anything. And to get the clothes for the girls, in the  grocery store you could go in there and they   d have piles and piles of  flour in sacks but they were print clothes. So Mama would point out,    I  want that one,    (it   d be ten foot tall up there)    And that one and that one  and that one.    To match, you know. To make one dress you had to have  three sacks, three bags of flour. But she always did that.  One time we went to Missouri. My dad would promise his in-laws if  they   d come to Oklahoma, he   d take Mama back every year. And he did,  but oh, what a mess. With seven kids, you can imagine. But Mama made  me a little suitcase that had seven days of clothes in it. And it was all the  same, all mustard colored. That was the only material she had  I   d have  a little hat and bloomers and a dress. So everyday I   d go in and change.  Well nobody knew I had changed  They always laughed because that  was my ritual, get up every morning and change into another set. And  then another set. And it   s all the same thing.  Do you have any of that color in your closet today?  No, I have none of that. That   s not my color   Did she make quilts too?  10  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Oh yes, they did. And we had, too   a lot of time, not always   had a big  thing, whatever you call those things to put them on.  Frame?  A frame. In the house. The neighbors would come and they   d all quilt.  Then they   d go to another neighbor   s house and do the same thing and  all make quilts. But that wasn   t usually what we did. Mama didn   t do  that all the time. But Rex, my son, has a quilt that Mama made herself  out of old pants and wools and things the boys had or Grandpa had,  these clothes and coats and things they   d just cut up in big squares and  then they   d tack them. So I gave him that one. Mama gave it to him  really; my mom did. He was going to Africa, so she thought he could  take it with him but I don   t think he did. And then one quilt that  Grandma Stuart, who had helped bring me into the world, made for me  when I was ten years old, a tobacco sack quilt. Her son smoked Bull  Durham. It was a little bag with tobacco and it had a little drawstring on  top. I don   t know if you   ve seen a Bull Durham sack. But anyway, she  tore them all apart and dyed them with tea. And then made it like brick  stones, like here and here. And then these little dividers, she tore up  other sacks, sugar sacks. She made it all by hand, all this, all by hand. I  gave that to Rex not long ago. But that was such a special thing because  nobody else got one. She   d made it for me.  Well how far did she have to go to get material like that? Was the store  in town?  No. See there was no material. She just used what they had there.  Because sugar sacks, you bought sugar in a bag of material.  About how close was the grocery store then? Where she would get the  flour?  Oh well, everybody went to Wakita which for them was probably three  and a half miles. But she just used sugar sacks and the Bull Durham  Tobacco sacks. Think of that old son of hers having that many pipes that  he filled to make a whole quilt   Took her a while to save that up, I bet.  Right. And tear them apart at that. So Rex has that at his house, too.  Do you remember any board games?  No. Most of the time we just played Rook. And at night if we had any  kind of a game it was cards, like Pig. I don   t know if you have ever  11  Finchum  Horning  heard of Pig? Well if you get four of a kind and if you   ve got four   play  like you   re all in a circle. Well if you   ve got four, you put your finger up  here at your nose. And then the last one that didn   t do that had to write  down ten. He got points. And the one that got too many points lost.  Anyway, that was big. And then we   d play spoons. That was the same  idea. There were six spoons and seven people, say. And if you had four,  say, of one of a kind you   d pass that around until you got it. Then if you  got that, well you   d reach in there and get that one spoon. And the last  one who didn   t get one then, boy everybody would pile on the table, you  know, trying to get that spoon and knock them all off. So those are two  games we played pretty often, all us kids did.  But Papa was good about   we played hide the thimble in the room and  Papa liked to play   he was strong. He   d put his head on one end of a  board or a chair then his feet over here and then have one of the boys sit  on him so he   d hold them up. Oh and the boys played arm wrestling,  sometimes they   d do that. A lot of times in the summer months though,  they made up   I don   t know if you ever remember seeing those (I   m  sure nobody did). Anyway the boys would take a shingle like you have  on a house and make an arrow out of it. And there was a notch right here  in it. Then they took a stick and had a twine like you bind the bales and  stuff with and have it in kind of like a sling-like thing and hook it into  that notch. And then the arrow would go way up in the sky and then it   d  come down. It had a real haunting sound, kind of like a turtledove  sound. They could do that so easy. They   d make them all the time. Or  guns. They   d make guns out of just a stick and then put a clothespin and  then you had your rubber band to the end and shoot with that.  And how would they learn to do those types of things?  I suppose, maybe Papa knew how to do it, or maybe they   d done it in  Missouri. I don   t know how they knew. I don   t think even the neighbors  did it. I don   t remember the Stuarts or anybody I knew making those.  But they were very good. In the summer, my sister, she was so ingenious  anyway, but we always had a play or some kind of a program going on.  She   d make out of newspapers   if we could find newspapers because  we didn   t take a paper, but somehow we got paper   and strip it and  make hula skirts. And we   d always make a banjo every year. I thought  of this last night, our banjos. We   d take a can and smash it, or two cans,  and nail it on a stick. Then you   d paint a pair of little things like they  would. Then you took 2    x 4      inner tubes. They don   t have those  anymore, but it was inside the tire, you had inner tubes. And you cut  those inner tubes in long rings so you have these long rubber bands we   d  call them and we   d string them on this stick with mashed cans and have  a ukulele. We   d play those all summer long until we wore them out.  Then every year you had to make new ones.  12  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  And what kinds of songs would you sing with these?  Oh, I don   t know. My mom played the guitar really well. She was very  good at it. So we always had old songs that she sang. They were just  Missouri songs, I   d call them.  And you mentioned you played the piano?  Yes, I just play by ear. I still like to play, yes.  And did you all have a radio?  We finally did. We had one upstairs that never worked so we never  could count that one. But Grandpa brought it from Missouri. It had a big  horn on it, you know. We always played like it was working. But  anyway, we finally did have a radio.  Did you listen to the fireside chats with Roosevelt?  Oh, yes.  Remember those?  You bet. And my dad was republican, a staunch republican. So we were  baptized into that. Believe me, I   m still a very strong republican. Very  conservative. But anyway, I remember a lot of times though, I remember  when they decided to kill the pigs because of the price or something. He  thought that was the worst thing. He   d just go on and on about having to  kill all the pigs so the price would go up. He just didn   t believe in that,  not at all.  So he had an opinion about the WPA and the CCC and stuff like that?  Oh yes. And see that was another thing, if you were a republican you  couldn   t get a job like that. Even though it was for everybody and kind  of like right now to have the economy or the job market open up. But if  you were a democrat you could get one. And some of the guys would  change their politics to get a job, because Grant County was solid  democrat, all their officials and all of Oklahoma. Up until Bellmon  became governor, the democrats controlled all that. So you couldn   t get  a job on the WPA. Chuck Horning got a job, Edward, my husband   s  brother, out here at the Salt Plains. But otherwise a grater job or any  kind of county job you couldn   t get if you were a republican.  Did any of the people around you have those types of jobs? Did you  know of anyone at the time?  13  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Oh yes. Most everybody that was on the county and, of course, you  know everybody practically. I mean that   s not that big of an area to  know them.  Did they build any buildings in your town with the WPA funds?  No, it was mostly roads. And the dam out at Salt Plains and a lot of  toilets, new toilets. Papa wouldn   t even let them build us one. We  wanted one really bad. He didn   t want to take the government money.  But Edward, my husband, his family did get the toilet, so that was a big  break. But anyway then they also made bridges, little county bridges that  needed it. So I suppose there were more jobs   there were post office  jobs and mail carrier jobs and things like that that were all appointed, in  those cases.  So you didn   t have indoor plumbing for a while?  Oh, no. Not until I was gone from home.  What about electricity then?  Well it came in after I was out of high school so I had already left. In the  meantime, one time Papa did put in a Delco system which is like we   d  have right now. The big fans, the wind turbine. It was battery operated  and had a little Delco house he built around that battery. And the fan was  on the side of the building, so we had one or two bulbs then. We didn   t  have to have coal oil lamps to carry around with us.  Then for refrigeration, what?  We just had ice. Every Saturday you   d go to town or whenever. If it was  in the summer you needed more. But you   d just go to town, get a 100  pound big block at the ice house there and put it in this ice box. That  would last quite a long time. Keep things cool. Otherwise your milk and  stuff, you had a big wire that went down in the big well out back and it  was cool down there, so that   s where you kept your milk in between  times. And then eggs were in the cellar, so therefore you had to go down  there and put the eggs down there so it would keep them cool.  What were holidays like in those days?  Well everyday   s a holiday. (Laughter) No, I don   t know. We always  had   the first year we were married, this is jumping way off, but we had  my family dinner, the Rapp side of the family, dinner at our house. We   d  just moved back from California and we had 93 people. So we always     that   s just my side, the Rapp side of the family and then there was the  14  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  other families had that many, too. So that went on for years, every  Thanksgiving or Fourth of July or Easter, not Christmas but Easter and  Thanksgiving and Fourth of July. Well they   d take turns. Papa   s family,  they had seven in his family and they all lived right around Wakita. So  therefore, they   d all take turns. And we had cousins running out our ears.  We always had a lot of fun though.  For Christmas during the Depression though would your parents do  anything in particular that you remember?  Lucky to get up. No, I remember the first time that I didn   t know that I  wasn   t going to get anything but I was sneaking around and there was  this little red purse in a drawer. It was the first time I knew there wasn   t  a Santa Claus because here was this little red purse. It comes up then on  Christmas morning on the sewing machine where I   d laid my sock. And  then my brother, it was always funny because he got some checkers, but  he didn   t get a board with it. So he   d go around all day,    Only but  checkers, only but checkers.    So there wasn   t much. They didn   t have  money to go buy anything. Hardly, I mean we were lucky to get that.  And we always chopped a tree down out in the front. We had cedar trees  and  we would  take a branch out of that and make the tree.  And my grandpa lived with us. There were always 11 of us. My two  cousins, their mother died and we practically raised them. So there was  always 11 of us all the time growing up, the two cousins, seven of us,  Mama, Papa, and my grandpa. So Grandpa, at Christmas he would bring  a big bucket, a wood bucket and four divided and all these different  candies like those curled kind, the hard candy, the chocolate with the  white filling in them, a pecan   I know you   ve seen them   peanut butter  squares and orange slices. We couldn   t wait until he would do that. And  then he left and went back to Missouri so we never got that anymore.  But it was always a great time for him to give us that. We didn   t have  oranges or things like that.  So after high school, what did you do next?  Well, I went to work. My mom was mad at me because I said she was  crazy about something. I don   t know, we   d had an argument. I said,     Mom, you   re crazy.    So when Papa came in she told him and the next  thing I knew I had my bags and I   m in Enid and Mama took me to  S.H.   Kress    Co. , I don   t know if you   ve heard of Kress   s, a variety store. I  went up and saw the manager and asked for a job for me and he gave it  to me. And then she went over to a little boarding house, over here to  just an old rooming house for girls and got me that. And we were on a  porch and she says goodbye and she kissed me. First time I think Mama  ever kissed me, I remember that. They were not   you know, for 11 kids  15  you don   t have time to kiss them all. So I didn   t think too much about  that. I just remember how that felt so odd that she would kiss me  goodbye. Well I didn   t see them for three months then. And then I had to  hitch hike home to even go home because they didn   t have cars or  nothing for me. So I worked there a year.  There was an opening out at the air base, Vance Air Base there in Enid  that needed mechanical draftsmen. I happened to know this guy, he  wasn   t a date or anything but he was telling me about the job. He said,     You ought to go out there and apply for that.    And I said,    I don   t  know drafting from anything.    He said,    Well I   ve got books.    In high  school he had it, so he loaned them to me and I studied them. I went out  there and passed the Civil Service Exam for drafting, so I worked there a  year, not quite a year, and then they transferred me to Pampa, Texas to  an air base, a new air base out there. I was supposed to be in the  engineering department, and I have no idea what I   m doing. Pretty soon  the military guys came up in the engineering department and had  drafting tables all over so I would just learn from them and they   d show  me what they knew. So I learned from just doing it. And then about a  year later, that   s when I met Edward. I was already engaged to someone  else, which is not a good story. But I met Edward and then I changed my  mind. I thought,    I can   t marry that other boy. I feel too strongly about  Edward.    So my folks wouldn   t let me stay home because I   d  embarrassed them because it   d already been printed in the Wakita paper  and that   s official, see. And so I had just enough   I had  6.25, I  remember. Papa took me to Medford and put me on the train.  I had an Aunt in Kansas City, so I went up there and stayed on   well in  Kansas City, Kansas is where all the air craft companies were. Her  husband worked down there so I   d go with him in the mornings and look  for a job all day. And then if I didn   t have nothing I   d stay on that same  corner and he   d come back in the evening and get me and take me back  home with them. Did that about a week and then finally got a job with  Commonwealth Air Craft Company there which made gliders. So I  stayed there another year with them and then that contract ended, the  portion that we were making. Their assembly was in Troy, Ohio so they  transferred me back there.  My part always in all this time was making drawings on linen which was  a   oh, you   d get them 20 feet long on linen material and it was all  drawn with India ink, so the engineers did not like to do that part. They  just wanted to design and get it over here. So my part was to put that on  these big long linen things in India ink and then if there were revisions,  then I had learned how to revise stuff enough from what they told me to  do.    I don   t like this. I need that at another angle. Would you do this?     So anyway that   s what kept me working because nobody else wanted to  16  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  do that kind of job.  So when I   m in Ohio, that was the assembly of these gliders took place  because the Normandy Beach head in June was going to happen and all  those gliders were going to be flown into Germany. So all that time we  didn   t know exactly where they were going. But we remember the day  that that came over the intercom at the engineering department there that  we   d invaded Normandy that morning and how tickled we were. But  then when you went to the movie, that   s where you had all the news reel.  You didn   t know anything   couldn   t get a picture otherwise until you  went to the movies. Well here   s these gliders going into all these hedge  rows and killing those guys and it made me really feel bad but at first  you thought it was really great we were having a part of the whole  invasion. But anyway, the war ended finally. Came home.  After being away six or seven years?  Yes.  And then talk about meeting your husband.  That was so funny, because two years earlier than that when he came  home on leave I was just getting home from Texas, coming home  because I didn   t want to marry this boy. So I came home and my sister,  it was so odd. No, I was still engaged to him I guess because my sister  was there and she said,    Let   s go over here and meet Edward. He   s over  here in front of the pool hall.    And I said,    Well, I didn   t know he was  even home.    She said,    Yes.    So I said,    That   s okay.    We walked over  there. On the way over there she said,    Wouldn   t it be funny if you   d fall  in love with him and marry him?    I thought, why would you say that?  I   m engaged to this boy down here. I   m on my way the next day to buy  my dress and everything to get married in. And that same night   my  sister who had married his brother, had us out to their house. And  Edward kissed me and I knew then, I thought, I   ll never be able to marry  this other guy. If I   m that fickle I sure didn   t want to put him up. So it  was two years later when Edward came home from the Navy. My dad  didn   t like him and they didn   t want me married, anyway. So two years  later Papa told Edward,    If you waited this long I guess it   s meant to  be.    Because in the mean time we   d write, you know, and everything.  I quit my job in Ohio because that was what we made up because you  couldn   t always get a whole letter because they   d cut it up if you tell  them where you are going or the ship is going to be here. He was in the  Navy. So we made it up that if the stamp was upside down that meant he  was coming home. So I quit my job there thinking he   s coming home  right away and came home to Wakita. Well in the meantime he didn   t  17  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  even remember he did that. So I have to get a job at the drugstore. My  folks still weren   t   I   m sounding like my folks didn   t care about me.  But I embarrassed them. So this old lady in the hills around Wakita, she  wanted me to come out and live with her, so I stayed there until Edward  came home, and then we got married. But we only went together that     we went together while he was on leave from the Navy. Four days or  five we went together. And then he got home on Saturday and we got  married on Monday. So we only went together those six or seven days  out of our whole life.  Many letters in between     Yes, we did. But he wouldn   t like me, part of the time he   d say,    Just go.  Don   t pay any attention. I   m not going to come home. Just go ahead and  find somebody else,    and I never knew when he was going to say that.  So I   d date a while in between. Even if I had rings I would still go ahead  and date because I couldn   t tell what he was going to do.  Well, talk a little bit about your wedding then, the actual day. Did you  elope? Or did you     Well, sort of. We just went to the courthouse there in Anthony, Kansas,  just across the border, and got our marriage license. Then you didn   t  have to have blood tests or nothing, up there you didn   t. And then just  went to this   they told us this parsonage guy from the Christian church  would be open. The Methodist guy wasn   t available. So we went to the  Christian church and that guy married us and his wife stood up for us.  We were supposed to go on to Wichita at the Alice Hotel, had a room  reserved and everything. It was so cold and terrible. And I had these  high heels and was trying to walk and run in the snow or grit and sleet. It  was just sleet, I guess it was. So he decided   and here we are in this car  that he had to borrow from his brother that   s all wired together, like I  said earlier. It didn   t have windows in it. It had cardboard for the  windows. I imagine he was embarrassed to have that car, too. I   ve  thought about that. But anyway, he called my mom and said   Claire, he  called her.    Would you mind having supper for us and we   ll just come  home.    So Mama called all Edward   s family and everybody came and  we had a big supper. And then my sister and her husband lived in a  house there in Wakita, it was so awful. But in the war, you couldn   t find  very many places to stay so my sister lived there. And they left   they  stayed with Mama and Papa while Edward and I   that was our  honeymoon cottage. So anyway, that was fun. Then he wouldn   t let me  go with him back to California. He had another year in the Navy, so I  had to stay with Papa and Mama for about six weeks then I went out to  be with him. By the way we celebrated our 51st wedding anniversary  before Edward passed away 13 years ago.  18  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  The rest is history, huh?  Yes, the rest is history. Came home, had Mark our oldest son in 1948.  And then Rex was born in    51.  I take it midwifes weren   t   ?  No, I had to have both of those guys cesarean.  And you said you were born by a midwife on the home place.  Yes. And this old aunt, she was   I don   t know, a relative. But anyway  she could actually keep people from bleeding. They   d call her when  someone was bleeding bad. Somehow, kind of like magic. So that   s why  they used her for somebody who had babies so they wouldn   t bleed to  death. She was just available, anyway.  Were all of your other siblings born at home?  Yes. Mama was very strong. She never was in the hospital until she was  old. She had a tumor and she had to have that done. But other than that  she never was in the hospital.  Did she help out with the farm or was most of her work in the house?  No, she just stayed in the house. She had too much to do. I was thinking  about comparing   we were talking about this recession and that time.  And, you know, there   s just no comparison even. You can   t even think  in that same way, that this is a depressing time. You might be depressed,  but it wasn   t like you   re without anything. There are government  programs, there are food banks. There   s so many ways to get food.  Maybe that   s the difference. You have to take the food now and cook it  yourself. That day you took the soup in the line and they made it for you.  Well, that   s about the time too that you could buy bread in loaves.  Oh, yes. Before that Mama always made five loaves of bread every  Monday morning and made beans and washed clothes, tons of clothes.  And so all the sheets, hanging that out in the winter, summer. But she  never failed to make that bread. And my brother and I came home from  school thinking we were smart. We opened this bread up and took a  whole lot of bread out from the inside and put butter on that. It was so  good. But then shoved them back together like Mama would never  know. (Laughter) But anyway, there was always lots of stuff that went  on in those days.  19  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Well, did you have assigned chores?  Yes. I had to get the water out from under the ice box. You know you  had a pan under there that dripped. That was my job, never to let that run  over. You had to take it out, take it outside and throw it away. And also  if Mama   s   this is kind of funny, but if Mama was on the phone, it was  so dry that the phone wouldn   t work if you didn   t pour water on the  ground wire outside. So when the phone rang, I was supposed to go get a  pan, get water, run outside and throw it over on the ground water so she  could hear. But it was really dry.  And if you happened to let the pan overflow, what would happen?  Oh, they hated me. Well, it would ruin the hardwood floors for one  thing. So I tried never to let it do it. But once in a while it did, made a  mess. I would have to mop and get it all back. And then another chore I  always had was to gather eggs. Mama gathered eggs, I gathered eggs.  But we all had chores. My sister always   I have a picture at home that  Rex is going to get. But my sister filled the oil bowl. Our cook stove was  oil and it ran down. You   d light all these burners. She always filled the  oil from the big tank outside. My job was to do the eggs and Mama   s job  was to do the eggs. Papa was to take care of the pigs. Gene   s over here,  my older brother, he was going to get ready to milk cows, shoveling the  manure out of the barn. My brother   s bringing in the cows, one of them.  The other   s bringing the milk buckets to the barn. Over here are my two  sisters flirting with their boyfriends in the old Model-T car over here. I  have this painting in my head. It   s already on a canvas, I guess.  But anyway, we all had jobs, but I was the worse one because I hated  every bit of that. And if I had to do anything outside I just groaned and  moaned and hated it. I was always listening to the radio and I would just  get as far as I could hear. No matter if the chickens were running, Mama  wanted me to put them in the   in the fall you had to get the chickens in  the houses so they wouldn   t freeze in the winter. So every evening  starting in October or so you   d have to start moving them over here to  these hen houses. Well, I would just get out here so far and the chickens  would go   my mom would get so mad at me. So they didn   t ask me to  do too much. I was not the best farm girl in the world.  Well what do you think from that time period you still apply today for  yourself? Like lessons learned back then?  Well, I think probably that I just try to be positive or joyful about every  day, just no matter what comes. I think that   s probably part of it. And we  had a lot of wonderful church times in a lot of ways, had good loyal  faithful Christian families around us, all the time. So I   m sure my faith  20  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  now is still part of that bringing up. And hard work and teaching the kids  to be hard workers and do the best they can. And I still think I have to  stay busy and do something productive every day, regardless. I don   t  know what it   s going to be but I   ll try to think of something. But I have a  lot of things I do.  Any frugal habits carried over from then?  Oh, yes. Don   t turn on the lights every time you get out of one room to  another. Don   t run hot water. These daughter-in-laws they come or  somebody else, they run hot water all the time they   re washing two or  three little things and this hot water   s running. I just can   t hardly take  that. It   s just so   we had to carry water all the time, all through that  drought and the Depression because there was no water in the cistern so  we had to haul water to put in the cistern to drink. Then you had to go  way down to another well to get water to boil. It was so hard. Mama  made lye soap all the time to break the water. You put water on your  burners in a big boiler and then you threw lye in to break the water and  then you skimmed all that foam off in a bucket. Then you could go  ahead and wash clothes in it. Otherwise you couldn   t hardly use it. But  we had to bring them up from the lower well all the time, those buckets  of water. So we were very hard up for water. I mean I can   t stand to let it  just run.  From what I have read, in those days if you needed an item replaced,  you   d try to find a used one before you would buy a new one.  Right. Oh, yes. You didn   t pretend to go buy anything. You were always  making do or figuring out another way to do it. You hardly ever   my  dad was really good at everything he did. He was very good with things,  outside especially. But Mama was just that good inside. She could make  dresses and not even have a pattern. She could make it out of a   she  would look at a dress in the store and then come home and make it. She  used newspapers for a pattern. She was very good. But you otherwise  just did without. You didn   t even think about new stuff.  Cash versus credit?  Yes, there was no such thing as credit. No you just   if you had money, I  don   t know what my brother and I   we   d always wish the tooth fairy  would come so we   d have these little cans   Prince Albert, it was  tobacco cans   and we put them under our pillow. Somebody in town  told us that we   d get money if you put it in; if you lost a tooth the fairy  would come. Put that under our pillow and nothing ever happened. We  never did get any money. But just anything to try to make a penny was  just something that you worked to do. Mama would give us an egg once  21  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  in a while and we   d take it to the produce house and the guy would give  us a penny.  And then what would you do with your penny?  Well, you went right directly to the grocery store. Both of us knew what  we were going to get. My brother always got the little gun out of wax  and I always got the hand that had a ring on it, just a metal ring. So you  could get those things for a penny and eat the wax and chew it up. Well,  inside was a little juice.  Do you remember going to your first picture show at the movie theater?  After going to the silent movies in Wakita   s community building we had  to go to Medford, if we went. Actually, when Shirley Temple started  being famous, Papa took us once or twice. I was just a little girl. Boy we  thought that was the best. She was just such a doll, you know, you just  loved her. Then he liked old Will Rogers. So sometimes we   d get to go  when he went. But we got so we couldn   t afford that so my mom  decided to do this. My brother Ralph, he could tell a story and just tell it  so well, so they sent him to the movie and then he had to come home  and tell us about the movie because we couldn   t all afford to go. So he  would make the movie better than it really was, probably. He could tell  stories so funny. You know, you think about those times and they were  hard but I hardly ever think of them as bad. I don   t remember thinking,  oh man this is awful. Everybody was poor so it didn   t really matter.  Nobody had anything. We made a lot of fudge and popped a lot of corn.  And you know, just so many of us. My older sisters got married pretty  young so they left home.  Did many of your friends move away during that time period?  Well the war helped immensely because we finally got out of this     everybody having nothing,    and that was not just us but I mean  everywhere. Well, then the military provided a purpose for these young  guys and me a job. I finally was somebody in my life. I had my own  way, I had my own money. And that was so different than what we   d  been raised all this time, out of high school even. So the war changed so  much that from there on it was never the same. I mean there was money,  it was here and there. We didn   t have money when my boys were little,  probably nothing until probably    56 or    57, then it began to pick up.  People got better jobs. All these young guys went to college when they  got home from the war or they could go to other schooling. My husband  took agriculture so he could just go to a place where they met at a  schoolhouse and they went to that. But some of the guys went to college  and went to teaching and so forth. So there was money then, finally. But  22  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  the whole war changed everything. I mean as far as people   s attitudes,  women were working. On this tape, I was telling about this woman who  wore jeans somewhere and they about died that she wore these jeans.  Nobody had slacks yet. Girls always just had dresses. So it was a big  switch to get to slacks and women working away from home. It was  probably a tragedy, really, but in the end it   s okay. But at least  everybody had a purpose. I think that was the main thing. The  Depression ended then and everybody went to work doing other things.  Well, do you have a favorite meal or a recipe that you miss from those  days or that you still make?  I know my very favorite probably was fried potatoes, pork and beans,  and fish sticks, or some kind of meat that I like, hamburger or  something. But fried potatoes. The only time I remember them   butchering  was five hogs out under these trees, I remember out in our  backyard, big white hogs. And then they had a big pot   one of those old  cast iron pots out there with fire under it and that was part of my job is to  go over here and get some wood and throw under that to keep it boiling.  But then they would take that fat off of those and you put the rinds in  this big vat to melt that lard and that   s where you got that lard off of that,  pigs. Then you   d butcher them and cut them up of course. But we had all  these old rinds. Then you use that lard and put it in buckets and put it  down in the cellar. So you make pies and everything out of that lard. The  only thing you went to town for was peanut butter, sugar, and coffee.  That   s about the only thing they bought in town.  You couldn   t grow peanuts?  No, we didn   t have a peanut farm.  Some did though.  Yes, that was south, way south.  Did you have any fruit trees on the property?  No.  Pecan trees? Nut trees?  No, nothing. We were lucky to have locus that had little flowers on  them   we   d eat the flowers   and a mulberry tree. That was about all.  And some evergreens out front that   d been planted there years before.  But that soil   s not conducive to trees too much.  23  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Was there a local library?  Heavens, I have no idea. No, I   m sure there wasn   t. No. I still don   t go  to a library and a lot of people do and read books and check them out.  But that   s just something I   ve never done. I don   t know why. I love  history, I like to read. I   m always reading something. I just don   t go to  the library.  Let   s back up a little bit. You mentioned you lived in a boarding house  when you first moved from home. What was that like?  Well it was kind of bad because in the first place, at Kress   s I made  7 a  week.  2 of that goes to this boarding house for me, so I   m only left with   5 here for a week of pay. You had to work all day and then Saturday  nights you had to work until 10 o   clock at night. That boarding house  was only about 2    blocks away, so it was pretty nice except it was just  a tiny little room about half of this up out there and a bed and a little  dresser. So when you got in there, it was pretty confining. I mean you  just didn   t know whether to go home at night or what. So finally this old  lady and I, her daughter lived there with her, we would visit then after a  while, they   d have me come down and visit them, so that was better. But  boy, it was tough that first month or two to stay in my room after I   d  work hard all day and only could eat one item a day. I could have a  hamburger, which was a nickel, at noon and a doughnut and coffee was  a dime. So for 15 cents a day   I had to figure that out. I can   t have too  many items. So when these guys had me come downstairs, it was so  exciting because they had food that they might offer me. That was just a  benefit of being there. But they were just very nice to me and I always  thought a lot of them. And they were good to me.  So Kress   s had a counter?  Yes, they had a lotions counter. This was where they had the little  hairpins, little hair items all through there. And then on the end of each  counter you had a special. These girls who worked there were from Enid  and they were very nice and all, but they didn   t have anything to do with  me. I mean I was an outsider, kind of. They   d come over here and  whisper and stuff. But anyway every week whoever sold the most of this  got an extra benefit, maybe 50 cents more. And I   d outsell them every  time and that didn   t go over too well. So I think that was part of it, that I  could outsell them every time, that whole week. So at the end of the  week I   d get them. Maybe it was candy or something. An old man would  come up and I   d say,    Don   t you think you ought to have that for your  wife? I bet she   d really like that.    And then you   d talk them into it.  At Kress   s, did they have a food counter?  24  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  No, they didn   t. Woolworth   s did, but we only had a candy counter  which was half a mile long, it felt to me but it was long, long, half of  that building. It had candy in all these slots. That was a big thing though  then.  So to get your hamburger, you   d have to go   ?  Just across the street. There was a little White Castle. It was just across  the road. So you walked everywhere. You didn   t have a car or anything.  Nobody else did. If anybody had a car, you wanted to date them. But  nobody had one.  Did Enid have a movie house at that time?  We did, yes, in Enid. But not in Wakita, at that time we didn   t. We had  one later, but we didn   t then.  While you were working at Kress   s in Enid, then you could have gone to  the movies if you     No, I couldn   t afford a movie. I was very frugal. But you know what, I  bought clothes and things I   d never been able to afford before. You see  I   d just gotten out of high school, so I just really was thrilled to have  7.  That was like I had  600, because I never had. I did work for my sister  but I only got a dollar the whole summer, working milking cows and  feeding the hogs and canning peaches and canning corn and taking care  of two little girls. That was a hard summer but I did get a dollar from  that all summer. Mama was just kind of glad to get me over there, I  think. But she needed help. She really did.  So do you can any today?  No, I don   t do anything like that. I don   t know, it seems like I always  had other things to do that I didn   t ever want to do that.  I don   t think very many people do now really.  No. It   s a hobby if they do. I have a friend that makes jelly now, but  that   s it. Those are times   I hated to go to the cellar to get the   I hated  Mama to bring food home, even from town. They always had this little  basket and I remember getting that up town full of grapes, little purple  grapes and that little basket had a handle here. I knew when they came in  the door that I would have to go to the cellar and get the glasses down  there. The snakes might bite me or the spiders would get me or  something down there. I dreaded to go to that cellar for everything. And  then I had to take my eggs down there and I knew there were spiders  25  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  over here. I was scared.  Did you ever see a snake down there or did you just decide     No, I don   t think I ever saw one, but I knew they were probably there.  And my brothers would tell me that. See, they were always telling me  stuff. I was always just one that they would tease. One time they put  Mama   s medicine and a whole bunch of stuff and mashed them together  and put them in a tablespoon and it looked like chocolate. They knew I  loved chocolate. They said,    You have to eat the whole thing. Put it all  in your mouth or you can   t have it.    It made me sick, I about died. It was  all kinds of medicine that Mama had in the medicine cabinet. So they  were always saying there were snakes here, they were always saying  stuff like that to me.  There was a hole we had in the house that went from outside and my  sister said if you sleep too close to that there   s probably a pirate or  something out there that   s got a long sword and if you get too close to  that, he   ll probably stab you. Well you can imagine all my   I   m over  here all this time trying to keep away from that little hole. (Laughter) Or  my sister would come home from a date and instead of blowing the light  out in the lantern, she   d wake me up and say,    Monta, you go blow that  out because you see if that wick gets down there it   ll probably burn the  house down. I   m going to bed.    Well, I   m already in bed and it   s late  and here she   s wanting me to get up and go. Which I did, I   d lay there as  long as I could stand it thinking I was going to let the house burn up. All  my life it seemed like I was always kind of the na  ve person they could  fool.  Sounds like they had good imaginations, too.  Oh yes, they did. That was everywhere, imagination was flowing.  In the winter time if the heat stove was downstairs was it very warm in  your room?  Oh no, gosh. Well, the upstairs wasn   t really finished. You could see the  shingles and some of those had holes. Well, if the snow was in you woke  up with snow all over your bed and you had to walk out and go  downstairs then because it would cover the floor even, the snow would.  So it was windy and cold and dirty. That   s why the dust came in. They  just never finished the upstairs. But that   s where all of us kids had to  stay was up there.  What would you do when it came bath time? How did you bathe?  26  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Well, we had this big tub, you could almost see it in the kitchen floor,  and you took turns washing. By the time you got to Mama it was  probably muddy, I don   t know, but she was always last. But we   d  always take turns taking a bath in it.  And heat the water or     Yes, we   d have to the heat the water on the stove first in big buckets  then fill it with cold water.  Was that once a day?  No, about once a week. I remember being so embarrassed because you  always had to have holes on the heels of your socks half the time  because you had to wear them so long. And then the back of those places  get rusty looking because they weren   t clean you know, just wasn   t  scrubbed. And if that hole ever got up there, you   d always try to get that  hole covered so that you wouldn   t see it. And I remember this one girl  that was at the school talking about little kids being humiliated but she  ran around hollering outside,    Monta   s got a hole in her sock  Monta   s  got a hole     (Laughs) I was so embarrassed about that because I knew  then she   d seen that hole that came up then and showed that little rusty  back of my heel. But anyway.  Would you darn them?  No, you just threw them away by that time. Mama didn   t have time to  mend them. But it just seems like you   I   m sure I wasn   t the only one.  All boys smelled like opossum or skunk or manure because they had just  been milking cows, so everybody smelled. Nobody had anything  anyway. Their shoes weren   t good. You went barefoot all summer. You  never had shoes on until it was time to go to school so your feet were  beat up by then.  Any home remedies then? What if you got bee stung? Did they do  anything?  Well the main thing was like if you had an ear ache, some old guy that   s  smoking, he would blow smoke in your ears so that that would warm  them up. That was part of it. I remember having a catfish sting. Oh,  that   s so terrible. But anyway that catfish would sting so Uncle Dell took  me on the side of the bank and put it in some manure that was hot, some  fresh manure. It drew that out of that foot. I mean it felt good. I don   t  know why, but it did, it worked anyway. There were always things that  Mama thought up that she   d done when she was growing up, like  sassafras tea. You   d drink it if you had certain things.  27  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  When you were a little bit older, when you were taking care of yourself,  did you do anything particular with your hair at that point? Would you  go get it cut or did somebody cut it for you?  No, I cut it myself, probably. But I had really long hair by now. That   s  the way they wore it during the war. Or wore it back up here kind of like  those Andrews Sisters. Make all those bows. They had bows up here in  their hair. Anyway it was exciting to have your picture made which I  had never done before. Then when I was in Kansas City I had it made  and I have pictures of my hair up. Clothes were my   I was just a nut for  clothes. I still like dressing, clothes and stuff. So a lot of my thinking     when I was in Pampa we had USO dances for the military there and  everybody had to wear long dresses and really nice heels, so that was a  big deal to get to go and wear your best clothes.  Well maybe you liking clothes so much now is a carryover from not  having many then?  Well, maybe so. I liked clothes even in high school but Mama was good  about making them enough that she kept up with the style and would  make things that I liked.  Did you learn how to sew?  I know how but that wasn   t my thing. I   ve always drawn a lot and had  that outlet that I didn   t need to sew and things. My sisters all could sew  and crochet and embroider and I just never did want to do any of that.  Well, you had other things.  Yes, I had other things. I have been a commercial artist for 60 years,  painting landscapes, portraits, and family homes plus many other  commissioned paintings. I also have been teaching Sunday school for 40  years.  Is there anything else you want to add?  Well I know I   ve been blessed, that   s for sure. I   ve had good health and  all my brothers and sisters have been long lived. Two were almost 90  that passed away. The other one   s still living, he   s 91, almost. My other  sister was 85 when she passed away. Two brothers were almost 66 and  79. So they all lived long. We all kept close over the years. I   m thankful  for that. I have a wonderful family, a special church family, and friends.  My life is truly blessed even at 85.  Where do you live now?  28  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  Finchum  Horning  I live in Wakita. Just in town, in the big city.  And you have two children?  Two boys, Mark and Rex, who are such a blessing. I also have two  special daughters-in-law who make them very happy.  Do you have any grandchildren?  I have three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. And you know  that   s another thing, they   ve been so good to include me in their lives.  Keeps my life   I   m living precariously I think through them. But  they   re so good to let me in on their lives and that helps too. Rex  especially is so good to call every week and Mark is good to check in  each week. They manage to have me at their homes when possible.  And they volunteered you for today.  They volunteered me. And I said yes. Whatever you say, Rex, it   s okay  with me.  Well, if you don   t have anything else, I very much appreciate your time  today.  Well, you   re welcome. Thank you.  It   s been a delight.  Thank you, I appreciate that.  -------  -------
