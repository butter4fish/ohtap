 Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Today is June 21, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I am a mile and a half South of Antelope Hills, in the  northwest corner of Roger Mills County, near Durham, Oklahoma.  Today I   m talking with Donnie Chappell, and we   re talking about  growing up in the 1930s.  We are also joined by Donnie   s wife Grace  Chappell, his daughter Cherie, and his friend Gary Sides.  Thank you so  much for having me here today.  Yes, ma   am.  Let   s start out by having you tell me where you were born and when.  I was born in Van Nuys, California, in 1929.  How did you get out to California   or how did your parents get out to  California?  My mother was raised out of Stratford, Oklahoma, and my aunt and my  granddad had a store in Stratford. My mother and my aunt were real  good friends. My daddy was a lineman in California, working for the  city of Los Angeles. He was coming back, visiting, and that   s how he  got acquainted with my mother. They got married in 1928.  Where   d they get married?  At Stratford, I   m pretty sure.  And Stratford   s known for the peach business. Did they have anything to  do with peaches?  Yes, yes. We   ve been through there quite often. I used to sell cattle and I  5  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  had to go down through there going to Ada to that other part of the  world to sell cattle.  So, how did your parents get out to California after they got married?  Well, they just drove out there. He had bought a brand new 1928 Essex  car. They drove out there and that   s where they lived their first year. In  1929 there, they had the big wreck in October. Well, the city of Los  Angeles let him go and he didn   t have a job. So, my grandmother and  my aunt kept writing to them and telling them about this wonderful farm  my granddad had bought here, and they needed some more help farming  it. By the time my daddy and mother got loaded up what little bit they  owned and came back here, well, my granddad and my uncle did not  know a word about it. So, then things really got rough, then. I remember  in about    31 or    32   I can   t remember the exact year   they raised a bale  of cotton per acre. By the time they paid the cotton pickers and paid the  gin, there was nothing left to go in their pocket. So, they raised chickens  and we ate chickens and hogs. They had cows that helped, but it didn   t  get as dry here as it did in a lot of parts of the world because it seemed to  me like they raised a little bit of wheat or cotton almost every year, they  just couldn   t get anything for their price.  Did you have any brothers and sisters?  I had one sister. She was born in    32. Her name was Patsy. She died  several years ago.  So, where did you move when you came back to Oklahoma?  Right here.  To this   ?  Right here. I   ve been here ever since 1930.  Your grandparents, were they in this area?  Yes. See, he had bought this farm. About a year after I got back here, if I  remember right, my grandmother and granddad moved to Elk City. My  mother and my dad and my aunt and my uncle lived here in this house  and farmed. I believe it must   ve been about    33 or    34, my aunt and  uncle rented another farm, down south of here, and they moved down  there.  Well, what was Durham like in those days?  6  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Oh, it was a bustling little place. They had a hotel, two grocery stores, a  filling station, two blacksmith shops, a gin, a flour mill, a big school,  and a telephone office. We did have rural telephones out here, which a  lot of country didn   t have.  What year did that start? Do you know?  I have no idea. It was before I was born. (Laughs)  So, where did you start to school?  At Durham.  Was it called Durham school?  Yes, Durham District One. I guess they were the first consolidated  district in Roger Mills County.  How long did you go to school there?  Until 1947, until I graduated.  What were some of your chores growing up?  Well, to start out with, we raised a lot of chickens. I had to take care of  the baby chickens. I had to keep them shut up. I had to gather the eggs  and had to take care of some hogs. We   d soak rye and wheat in a fifty-five  gallon barrel, let it soak, and then we   d pour it out for the hogs.  That   s how we fattened them out.  How many hogs would you raise at once?  Oh, not a lot. We   d just have one ol    sow and a bunch of pigs, whatever  we raised, and we butchered most of them. We didn   t ever hardly   I  don   t think we ever sold any hogs. We just butchered them.  Did you have a smokehouse?  Well, yes, in a roundabout way. It was just one of the back rooms of the  house, where my dad put sugar cure on them and cured them out.  What about chickens? How would you kill those?  Oh, that was quite a story. We need to jump clear back up to 1941.  That   s when we had a great big wheat harvest year and they bundled it  all, shocked it, and then we thrashed it with a thrashing machine. My  7  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  mother hired a girl to help her with the cooking. We would have to go  out and kill about twenty fryers every morning. If we could get them  caught, I had to step on them with a stick and pull their heads off, or I  had to chop their heads off. If we didn   t get them caught, I had to take  my .22 rifle and shoot them in the head. Then we   d scald them and pick  them. Then my sister and that other lady did the dressing, while, I guess,  I went and milked. Then after that, we   d go and dig potatoes. Then  they   d fry or bake those potatoes. I can   t remember exactly how they  cooked them, but they   d feed about twenty of those harvest hands every  day. How in the world they cooked it all on one stove, I don   t know.  Wow. So, would you usually have a lot of help in the fields?  Well, just during harvest.  Would those people be townspeople? Where would they come from?  They were mostly people in this area, followed harvest crews that  worked. They slept all over the place in barns and granaries and wagons,  under a quilt. It was a different deal.  You mentioned milking cows. Did you have a lot of cows to milk?  We just milked from two to four. My daddy said milking cows and  selling cream wouldn   t make anything but cigarette money, so we never  did. We just had enough for our own use, to make our own butter and  raise a calf or two to butcher.  What about soap? Did your mom make soap?  I remember helping my grandmother make soap in a big ol    iron kettle.  We   ve got one sitting around here somewhere. I don   t know where it   s  at now. But we   d build a fire outside and put cracklings in it, which was  our hog rinds, and boil the lard off of that, and then mix lye with it, then  stir it until it sat up. Then we   d take a butcher knife and cut it into  squares.  And that was just for your personal use?  Yes, we used to wash with a rub board. Then in later years, they finally  got an old Maytag with a one cylinder motor on it that put, put, put.  What about bath time? How would you bathe?  Well, in the wintertime we had a number two washtub. Every Saturday,  that was a bath. In the summertime, we had a cream can up in the  8  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  windmill tower and it was my job every day to go out and carry a bucket  up with a rope and fill up this cream can. Then we had a hose hooked  onto it, where we could take a shower every night.  And that was refreshing. (Laughs)  Yes.  I haven   t heard many people setting up a shower.  Oh, yes.  That sounds fun. (Laughter)  Well, you ought to have been up in that windmill tower, pulling that  bucket up there and filling that thing up every day.  Yes. (Laughs) What about your mom   s cooking? What do you  remember?  Well, she did an awful lot of frying. She fried all those darn chickens. I  can   t imagine frying twenty chickens every day  We always had a big  kettle of red beans. We had a lot of potatoes. She had mashed potatoes  and gravy and a lot of times, you   d have a big skillet of fried potatoes.  Did you raise a big garden?  No, we can   t raise a garden up in this old, tight ground. We tried to plant  one out there one year, and I remember hooking an old rubber hose up  out here to that horse tank and we had a garden planted. We were  siphoning water out of that horse tank. It would run down the road in the  hot winds and the garden burned up. (Laughter) We had water running  down the rows.  So, where did you get produce?  We raised the potatoes and we bought dried, red beans. That   s about all  we bought.  Do you remember some dust coming through?  Oh, yes. I think it was in    34, or maybe    35. I don   t remember exactly  what year it was. We were at Berlin to a singing on a Sunday afternoon,  and when we came back through Cheyenne, that big wall came rolling  down out of Colorado. It scared everybody to death and they pulled into  a neighbor   s pasture, north of town there, went to a cellar, lit the coal oil  9  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  lamp, and everybody was scared to death. After a while, my uncle went  out and looked and he said,    It   s just another dirt storm,    so we started  on home. I think he even turned the headlights on that ol    Model A to  drive on home.  When you got home, was your house covered in dust?  Oh, I remember waking up every morning and the only white place on  my pillow was where my head was. In 1938 we had a terrific snowstorm  here, in April. I got stranded away from home, and I got home three or  four days later. But snow blew so hard that it went through the shingles.  It filled the attic of our house up with snow and they got up there, started  digging it out, and there was just about as much dust up there in that old  attic as there was snow. It was the awfulest mess you ever seen   Wow, I bet  (Laughs) Did people have trouble breathing during the Dust  Bowl Days?  I guess, but it didn   t bother us. (Laughter)  Is there anything else you remember about the Dust Bowl?  I just remember dirt was in the air for hours and years. For a long time,  you wouldn   t even see the sun for several days. You   d just see a little bit  of a glow up there. There was just a lot of wind, a lot of dirt.  What about the Depression? Were you aware of the Depression  beginning and your family being affected?  Well, we were just all used to it. I can remember way back there in the  early    30s, going up to Durham to the grocery store, and they sold a  Hershey   s bar, about this wide and about that long and about that thick  for a penny, but I didn   t have a penny. I could just look at them.  (Laughs) Now, you can buy one like that for a dollar or something.  (Laughter)  Do you remember prices of any other items at the grocery store?  Not a lot.  Would your mom make bread?  She made biscuits. Somehow or another, my dad, he worked at every  kind of an odd job you could imagine. He drove a truck from the grocery  store up here to Clinton, to haul produce to Clinton, and then haul  groceries back the next day. It took two days to make a trip to Clinton in  10  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  an old Model T truck. Then in later years, he clerked the sales, then he  went to clerking at another grocery store, and he drove a school bus. He  did everything he could just to make a few pennies. I know there wasn   t  any money. I can remember that much.  Was he farming also?  Oh, yes.  What were the main crops?  Wheat and cotton. I remember one year, they raised a bunch of seeded  ribbon cane. A fellow by the name of Mark Pondexter, who lived about  a mile South of Durham, he had a mill that you   d hook one horse onto it  and pull it around and around, and it would crush that sorghum. It would  come out and they boiled it, and that   s how they made molasses. I can  remember feeding that ol    thing with those leaves of that green   oh,  those bundles were long. They were probably eight or nine feet long. I  wasn   t too big, but I remember helping feed that stuff in there and that  horse would go around and around, and run those rollers and crush it and  they   d get the juice out and put it in vats, and then make the molasses.  And you   d eat that on the biscuits?  Yes. Oh, yes. It was good.  Well, if you didn   t raise a garden, did your mother can?  Yes. Yes, we canned a lot of beef and canned some pork. I know they  canned some fruit because we had to have some peaches and apples. Oh,  there   s an apple orchard back north of here. We   d go down there in the  fall and get apples. They canned some of those apples. I remember that.  Did your parents talk much about politics?  Not that I can remember too much.  Did they talk about WPA  Works Progress Administration  or CCC   Civilian Conservation Corps ?  Oh, yes. They were the first thing in this country to   the CCC boys  helped plant that tree row up there. WPA built 33 Highway and 283  Highway, over here. That would be back in the    30s.  Do you remember watching that?  11  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Some of it, I remember seeing some of it.  I took a tour through the community building earlier. That was a WPA  project?  No, they built that up there, just the next year after they done away with  the WPA, but most of the laborers that had helped build the one over at  Crawford were WPA men. They came on over here and they hired them  and they finished building it up here. I   m not sure, but I think they built  that in    38.  Did your parents talk about Roosevelt any or did you listen to Fireside  Chats on the radio?  Oh, yes. We listened to every one of them. I remember that because I  remember my daddy, somehow or another, ended up getting a radio. The  Lutz, back north down here, would always come up whenever there was  a prize fight with ol    Joe Lewis and we had to listen to that. He had an  ol    six-volt battery that hooked that ol    thing up. I think he had to take it  out of the Model A to hook it up to the radio to make it work. Everybody  sat on the front porch and listened to the radio. We were one of the few  that had a radio.  What other programs would you listen to?  I remember listening to The Lone Ranger and Light Crust Doughboys  were on there. That ol    Bob Wills, just wonderful music. I grew up  listening to that. Yes, Lone Ranger and Tonto was one of the few, and  there was something about a squeaky door. Then I remember Fibber  McGee and Molly. Oh, shucks  I can   t even think of that stuff. (Laughs)  Was there an ice plant around?  We did have an icehouse up at Durham in Guy Gabber   s cream station,  and they hauled that ice in from Shattuck or Woodward   I do not  remember which   and that had to be after they built the 283 Highway.  That truck came in once a week and he had great big, thick quilts and  stuff over that stuff to keep it from melting. It had that big ol    ice, it  seemed like, in great big chunks. They   d pull them in there and put them  in that icehouse. We   d go up there and we   d buy, maybe, fifty pounds of  ice for fifteen cents or twenty cents. I can remember that. It wasn   t too  much money.  Then what would you do with it, when you got it home?  We   d have iced tea, and sometimes they   d make ice cream. It was  12  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  mostly for iced tea and for that little wooden ice box that they tried to  keep food cool in. They kept butter in it and they kept milk in it. I hadn   t  thought about that.  Did your mother quilt?  No. She mostly made clothing. She cut her own patterns out, out of  newspapers, to make dresses and blouses, and to make my sister dresses.  She was quite a seamstress.  What would you all do for entertainment?  Twiddle our thumbs, I guess  (Laughter) We did a lot of hunting and a  lot of fishing. Every spring, the ol    Washita River would get real big,  and we   d go down and catch fish out of it. In the fall, we   d hunt squirrels  and we hunted a lot of ducks, a lot of quail. The country was full of  game, then. It was before all the city people thought they had to come  out and have the reservations to hunt them.  Were there dances?  Oh, yes. My aunt had a Victrola wind-up deal and she had one record I  really remember. It was some kind of a waltz. Her and my mother both  loved to waltz, so whenever we   d go over there, I   d have to dance with  one of them, then they   d rewind it and I   d have to dance with the other. I  wasn   t very big and I started waltzing when I was very young. Then  there was a lot of barn dances and I finally learned how to do about  every kind of country dance there was, way back there.  Do you still go to dances?  If they have one close enough. I have a little trouble riding anymore. So,  I don   t travel too good, anymore.  Did your parents play any musical instruments?  My mother could play the piano by ear.  Did she have a piano?  No.  Would they play any card games or dominos or anything?  Oh, yes, yes. We grew up playing pitch and dominos.  13  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Would your parents have some people over to   ?  Oh, yes. I   ve seen them have big card parties, several, because they   d  have three or four tables of dominos or cards.  What about as a kid growing up? What else, besides hunting, would you  do to entertain yourself?  Danged if I know  (Laughter) I finally got me a bicycle when I was  about ten years old. We rode all over the country on the bicycle. One of  the dumbest things I ever pulled, I went and pushed it on top of Antelope  Hills one time, and rode it down off of there. But I didn   t do it but once.  It got to going awfully fast and I was on the brakes. I was leaving an  awful trail behind me, but I was lucky I missed the rock and trees and  everything. Got down to level ground, and I came on home. (Laughter)  That was a little bit too wild of an event for a little boy. (Laughter)  How many people were in you class at school?  Oh, gosh  There were probably twenty my age whenever we first started,  of boys. The girls didn   t count. (Laughter) I can   t even tell you how  many of them there were.  So, would you ever go into town on Saturdays?  Finally, along in the late    30s, we got to where we would go to  Cheyenne on Saturdays. I believe it was in    38 or    39, Charlie Godfrey  was farming wheat up here and he hired me to scoop wheat back in a  grainer, while they were hauling it in from the combines and scooping it  into the granaries. I was scooping it back and he gave me fifty cents a  day. I had two dollars and fifty cents, and I remember going to  Cheyenne and I bought me a used pocket watch for fifty cents and then  gave a dollar for a chain. Oh, I was proud of that  (Laughter)  Would you ever go to the show?  Oh, yes. In the    40s is when we really started going to the shows. Late     30s and early    40s, we started going to picture shows, but before that,  we didn   t go to too many of them. I remember quite a story. Way back  there in the day, we had a superintendent that got a projector to where he  could show picture shows up there at Durham, in our auditorium, in the  schoolhouse. Every Saturday they   d have picture shows up there. We   d  ride horses up there and then go to the picture show. There were some  people down in the Midway area, his name was Buster Woods, and he  wasn   t quite all there. They had this series going on about this wild  stallion. They couldn   t find him. Then they showed it in the show and  14  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  there he was, up on the hill. They didn   t know where he was and Buster  says,    There he is  There he is  Can   t you see him? He   s right up there      And everybody got a big bang out of that. (Laughter)  Did they have shows very often there?  I think they had them every Saturday night, that one year when that  superintendent was here. I can   t even remember who he was. It might   ve  been Short Cordell, but I think that was before his time. I   ll be danged if  I know  (Laughs)  Were there many community events in Durham, where everybody would  get together?  Oh, they   d have a boxed supper it seemed like, once or twice a year.  Then they always had cake walks. I don   t know just exactly what, they  must have some kind of a   it must   ve been for Halloween parties or  something.  What about at Christmas? What would they do?  They   d have a Christmas program. They   ve had one up here for a  hundred years. Some of them will tell you how many exact years. I don   t  know what it is. (Laughs) They   ve had a Christmas tree at Durham for a  long, long time.  Would you all have a Christmas tree in your home, also?  Oh, yes. We didn   t have one until   oh, it was probably sometime in the  late    30s, early    40s, before we ever had one.  Would you get together with family on Christmas or Thanksgiving?  Yes, all of the family always comes here on Thanksgiving. Then on  Christmas, we went to my grandmother   s, down at Elk City. And on  Easter, we went down to my Aunt Violet and my Uncle Pete   s, or we   d  go down to Berlin to Uncle Shorty   s.  Did you all have a turkey on Thanksgiving or what did you   ?  No, we had ducks or prairie chickens. (Laughs) It was very seldom we  ever had turkey. That just came along in later years.  Well, back to the mid    30s. Do you remember the government coming in  and purchasing the cattle?  15  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  I faintly remember it. I remember them talking about the sheriff or the  deputy sheriff shooting them all with a .30-30 Winchester. It seems to  me like I remember my dad bringing part of one home and my mother  canning it. But I think I must not have been very old. That must   ve been     33 or    34 or    35. I can   t remember the exact year, but I remember them  talking about it.  Well, tell me about the rabbit drives.  We didn   t have any rabbit drives, we just went out and hunted them. It  was very illegal, according to the game laws nowadays, but we drove the  section lines in our old Model A   s and old Essex car and we   d shoot  rabbits off the side of the road. I wasn   t old enough to go to school yet,  but I could put the rifle underneath my arm and lean down like this.  (Gestures) I could shoot the rabbits on my side of the road until I missed  one, and then I couldn   t shoot anymore that day. So, I learned to not ever  miss. We   d get two and a half cents an ear for those rabbits.  For a set of ears or per ear?  For a set of ears. One time, I remember we were going to Durham in an  old Model A, and my mother shot one out there on the side of the road,  and I ran out there and got my pocket knife and I cut his ears off, popped  them off like you were scalping an Indian, and the rabbit got up and ran  off. So, a few days later I heard about a fellow by the name of E.C.  Davis up there. He didn   t have enough money to buy a gun, but he had a  dog that could catch rabbits. He was really a moaning and a groaning,  his dog caught a rabbit that didn   t have any ears. (Laughter)  Would you eat the rabbit meat, yourself, after?  We would eat the young rabbits in the spring, otherwise we wouldn   t eat  them. They always thought they had some kind of disease after they  grew very old.  Was there a crow problem up in this part at all?  Not to speak of. There were a lot of crows, but they weren   t much of a  problem.  Well, do you remember your first tractor?  My granddad bought it in 1928. It was a Farmall, which is smaller than  an F-20. It was a small tractor, but it pulled a two-row lister, a two-row  cultivator, and they had a four-row monitor. They had a three-section  harrow and a four and a half foot sander one way, and a ten foot  16  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  international wheat drill. That   s what my dad farmed with, until 1940 or     41.  So, how old were you when you started driving a tractor?  I was quite old. I think I must   ve been fourteen or fifteen before my dad  ever put me on a tractor, to drive it. It must   ve been in    44, because he  got hurt in a car wreck and he never did do a lot of work after that. I  ended up doing most of the farming from then on.  How would you get to school?  Oh, we had a dandy school bus. I believe it was an old International  truck. I don   t think it had hard, rubber tires. I think they were balloon  tires, but I   m not sure. It had a two-by-six down that side and a two-by-six  down this side and two two-by-sixes down the middle, here, with a  board in between to lean against and you sat on that. It had isinglass  windows. It was pretty cold in that danged old thing  (Laughter) We  were in it in 1938, after April, when we had that big snow storm, and it  got stuck a mile east of Durham. Johnny Armstrong had three kids at  that time, and that whole busload of kids went in to his house and they  stayed there for three or four days. Oh, we ever got out of there. My dad  was working in a store in Durham, at that time, and he had two high  school boys that came down there and helped walk me whenever it  finally quit snowing and walked me back up to Durham because the  snow drifts were over this tall. (Gestures)  If you remember, from when you came through Durham up there, you  see that old building there, that rock building on the corner. Well, there   s  a blacksmith shop on the side of the road, and the snow was so deep that  they tunneled from that building across the road to that blacksmith shop  to go back and forth through there. I remember Johnny Armstrong, he  had a windmill out behind his house there, between there and the barn. I  don   t know how tall it was   I wasn   t eight or nine years old   but the  snow whirled and whirled and whirled and finally made a cone-shaped  snow drift on the south side of that windmill that it went clear up to the  platform. (Laughs)  Wow.  I don   t know how tall it was, but I was too young, too little. But I  remember that thing shaped, went up through there. A lot of the horses  and cows in the country, they tromped the snow and tromped it. They  took the roofs off of those buildings because they get to packing the  snow down and tromping around.  17  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  Well, who would drive the school bus?  Oh, we had several bus drivers. Cloris Sibley, Bill Raff    Bill Raff came  along afterwards. He drove after we got a new bus, in the fall of    38.  Hmm, I can   t remember all those bus drivers. Maybe Alfred Lutz may  have driven one. I remember   I have trouble finding it   is in that old  school bus. There was a fellow by the name of Fred Barton, and I don   t  think he owned a vehicle at all. He rode horseback everywhere he had to  go. One morning whenever I got on the school bus, he was on that  school bus and he had his saddle lying over that middle. He rode to  school on the school bus with us and carried that saddle over to the boot  shop. We had a fellow that made handmade boots at that time. He was  peg-legged Northrup. He had to have some work done on that saddle, I  guess. So, he went over there to have that work done. That evening, he  was on the bus and he rode back home, got his saddle back home. There  wasn   t much means of transportation. There were a lot of people that did  not have vehicles and what of them that did, they were worn out and  wouldn   t run. (Laughter) And they didn   t have the money to repair them.  Would people ride horses into town?  Oh, yes. I remember way back there, I had gotten old enough I could  drive, probably. I started driving when I was ten, eleven, twelve years  old. I   d go up there at Durham and they   d come up there at Durham in  those old Model A   s, Model T   s, and old Chevrolet cars and say,     Whoa, you son of a gun  Whoa     and bouncing off the curb and pulling  back on the steering wheel because they sat there and held on to those  lines and drove those teams for so long. They couldn   t think to step on  that dang brake  (Laughter) Now, I can sympathize with them, because  you take all this computerized stuff and these damned cellular phones  and things   they just blow my mind  I can   t handle them. (Laughter)  And I know just how those old fellows were.  Well, what about school? Do you remember any teachers in particular  or things that you   d do at school?  I remember a few good ones and a lot of bad ones. That probably was  one of the worst years of my life, whenever I had to go to school.  (Laughter)  What was good about it?  Oh, getting out in the afternoon and getting to go back home. (Laughter)  Would you have recess?  18  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Yes.  Did you do anything fun at recess?  Oh, yes. We played black man.  What   s that?  You play tag and run back and forth, across through there, and had to get  through there without getting tagged somehow or another. There was  quite a bit of marbles played and a little bit of mumble peg. Back then,  you carried a pocket knife to school. You weren   t called a crook, then.  (Laughter) It was okay to whittle.  Would you bring your lunch to school?  Yes. I remember in the late    30s, they had some kind of a program when  we finally went to get hot chocolate, a cupful of hot chocolate. My  mother would make me   somehow or another, my daddy could buy a  loaf of bread. She took and mixed mayonnaise and potted meat, and  made me two sandwiches. I would dip that in that hot chocolate. And  boy, I thought that was wonderful  (Laughter)  Did you have a graduation ceremony from high school?  Yes, I don   t remember too much about it. I wasn   t too dang interested.  (Laughter) I just did not like that dang school life at all.  What did you do after you finished high school?  Oh, good gosh almighty  I traveled. I went to see the world. There  wasn   t anything to see. Like a bird that flew over a mountain, all it is, is  the other side of the mountain. I spent a winter in eastern Oklahoma,  working on a farm, and the next winter I went out to New Mexico and  worked in a lumberjack sawmill and loaded logs, skid logs, and did that  kind of stuff. Then I came back home, helped them build this house.  Then a neighbor down here kept telling me I ought to get into  bulldogging. I had no idea what bulldogging was, but I had a couple  neighbor boys that said they were getting ready to go to a rodeo. They  said,    We   re going to get into team roping down there.    I said,    Bull  If  ya   ll do that, I   ll get into bulldogging.    He said,    If you   ll jump, I   ll pay  your entrance fees     So, I went down and entered it. I didn   t really know  what I was getting into.  So, I got to thinking about it, and I thought,    I better figure out what the  thunder they   re doing.    I wasn   t the first dogger out and I watched the  19  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  first ol    boy come out. I said,    Oh, well, I can do that  I   ve done that out  in the pasture. I know what they   re doing now,    but I didn   t have  anybody to haze for me. I knew one ol    cowboy there. I knew him from  Cheyenne. I walked around and asked him,    Will you haze for me?        Oh, no. I   m riding the green bronc, but I   ll get somebody to.    Well, this  ol    horse I had, he hadn   t ever been in town before, except just tied up at  the hitching rail. I backed him up in there and was going to dog this ol     steer and he thought I backed him up there in the shade. I nodded for the  steer and they turned him loose and that ol    horse just stayed there. I  liked to have never got him to go  So, finally, I got him clear to the other  end of the arena and brought him back up to the fence, got off of him,  and threw him about forty or fifty seconds because I wanted to get that  five dollars I owed the other ol    kid for the entrance fee.  So, they mounted me on a good horse the next day and threw one in six  or seven seconds. Then I was ruined. Hell, I thought I was the world   s  champion cowboy for years. (Laughs) So, then I rodeoed for a long time.  But I was better at mugging cattle and bulldogging than anything else. I  never did learn to be a bronc rider, a good one. I always had to ride the  rough string, but I had to ride him. I didn   t throw a fit on him, like  you   re supposed to. I never did know how to do that. (Laughter) Yes, I  won quite a bit of bulldogging.  Where would you practice?  I never. (Laughter) Well, you see, we worked cattle, back then we   d  round them up and just put them in corral and go into it and just pick  them up by the front legs and the hind legs, or rope them and put them to  a snubbing post and throw them down. We manhandled all of our cattle  we worked. Up until in the mid to late    50s before we even had a chute  to put one in. We had done it all by hand. So, I   d had a lot of experience  handling cattle and handling a lot of crazy horses. I rope a lot of horses.  The first horse I broke, that ol    boy gave me five dollars to break his  horse. I   d just ride the rough edge off him, that was it.  How long does that take?  Oh, a month. Two or three weeks, a month to get the rough edge   if  you   re going to teach one something, it takes three or four years.  So, do you wear a saddle when you do that or   ?  Oh, boy  Let me tell you about my first saddle. (Laughs) We were  driving the milk cows in and I had an old Hereford bull that had horns  about this long on each side. (Gestures) I   d take a piece of bailing wire  down there and I   d tie it on each horn, and I   d get on this old bull, ride  20  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  him in, and drive those cows in. The neighbor saw me doing that one  afternoon and he jumped on my dad about that. He said,    That boy needs  a horse. I   ve got just what he needs over there.    He sold me this little old  bay horse. I don   t have any idea for how much money, probably fifteen,  twenty dollars. I got a bridle with him, but I didn   t have a saddle. I could  tap him on the knees with my reins and he   d drop down to his knees, I   d  get on him. Well, then if I   d start to head a calf, he   d turn, and I   d keep  going. (Laughs) I was just having an awful time riding that horse.  A few years before that, there were some people that drove a bunch of  long horned cattle in here, in the winter to my wheat pasture. A fellow  up here, by the name of Godfrey, had bought one of those cows that was  a half Jersey cow, half longhorn. She had a bobbed tail and the bush was  off of her tail. I had to milk her every day and that was just like hitting  you in the head with a billy club. It   d go wham  Wham  Wham  It would  always hit me when I was trying to milk her. I was ducking and dodging  because she   d always hit me with that damned ol    tail. So, this fellow  was a horse trader and he   d come down to Arkansas and trade off horses  and stuff. He came back in with a brand new saddle, with a picture of a  mule on the fender. My folks were gone. I don   t know where they were  gone to. I had to stay home and do chores and take care of everything.  He said,    You want to trade me this saddle?    I said,    Shoot  I don   t have  any money.    He said,    What do you have for a trade?    I said,    I   ll trade  you a danged ol    long-horned cow.    He said,    Okay.     Then after, boy, I was proud of that. Then I got to thinking about that,    I  just wonder what my mother and daddy is going to say when they come  home.    (Laughter) So, they came home and I told them what I had done.     Okay.    So, I   m sure my daddy had done made a deal with that guy for  that saddle, but I don   t know. So, then, I finally had a saddle. (Laughter)  When you were taming a horse, would you use a saddle?  Oh, yes. It   s hard enough to stay on with a saddle, much less bareback.  They can throw you a lot easier, bareback. I remember trying to ride  them bareback and pull all their mane out and they just went off. It   s just  not too good a deal. (Laughter)  What year was this house built?     49.  And you   ve lived in it since?  Yes.  21  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  How did you meet your wife?  Our sheriff had a little gray mare that he wanted me to take and use, to  see what kind of a dogging horse I could make out of her. So, I went  down to Cheyenne, I went up to the sheriff   s office, and the sheriff  wasn   t there. This real cute little ol    black headed gal was sitting behind  the desk. I said,    You know where the sheriff   s at?    She said,    No.    I  said,    Are you his secretary?    She said,    Yes.    I said,    You ain   t a very  damn good secretary if you don   t know where the sheriff is.    (Laughs)  She never did tell me anything. I thought,    Well, shoot. I can find him.     I went downtown and I think he was at the pool hall playing dominos or  something. I went ahead and got this ol    mare and brought her home. I  got to thinking,    I just wasn   t very nice to that girl. I just didn   t treat her  like I should   ve. I need to apologize to her.    Hell, it took me two months  to ever get her to where she   d even go and eat a dinner with me   (Laughter) Well, by the next summer I was married to her. (Laughter)  Yes, I worked pretty hard at that.  How long have you been married?  Ooh, fifty-eight years, I think, this year. (Laughter) Yes, yes. We got  married in    53.  How many children do you have?  Three girls, nine grandkids, six great-grandkids, and two more in  August.  Wow. (Laughs)  We   ve got a hell of a pack. (Laughter)  Do they come out here very often?  Yes. Yes, most of them do. Yesterday, I had about half of them   maybe  not half, about a third of them. Now, see, I had two daughters, three  grandkids, and three great-grandkids here yesterday and for Father   s  Day. And my other daughter, she did call, but she lives up in Missouri.  The others live around here or not too far, at least?  Oh, they   re scattered from Missouri to Tulsa, back to Weatherford and  Elk City. I think I covered everywhere. (Laughter)  How have you seen Durham change over the years?  22  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  Well, it died on the vine. (Laughs) There isn   t anything there anymore.  When did that happen?  In the    50s. Oh, I forgot the story I wanted to tell you about that back in  the    30s. We had a flour mill up here, at Durham. My dad would take  some wheat up there and get three or four 100 pound sacks of flour. We  had a scaffold down in our basement that was hung with some wire,  where the rats and mice couldn   t get up there on it. He had put those 100  pound sacks of flour up there. One year, we had fleas. Oh, God, It was  horrible  I don   t know what, but he mixed up a mixture of used coal oil  (kerosene), and maybe a little gasoline, and put it in a dishpan and set it  right down in the door of that thing. It put a lot of black smoke out, but it  lit a fire. You could hear those fleas, just popping and a snapping. They  all came and jumped into that fire and burnt themselves up.  Wow.  I thought that was really something.  Was the flour mill pretty big?  Yes. They moved it up to Cheyenne. Part of it is down there yet in the  Cheyenne mill, down there.  So, businesses just started moving out in the    50s?  Yes. The cotton gin left there in the    40s, I think. The blacksmith shops  closed down in the    50s and    60s, the garage quit, and then the grocery  stores finally couldn   t enough people to support them. Ol    Shindell, he  had the last service station up there, and he finally got Alzheimer   s. So,  he shut it down and nobody ever opened another one. All that   s left is  the post office and I figure they   ll do away with it anytime now.  What has kept you in the area?  By the time I was smart enough to leave here, I was too broke to go.  (Laughter)  How many people, do you think, are in this area still?  Oh, there are very few left, maybe twenty, forty, fifty families, if that  many. There used to be one on every 160  acre plot .  Where do the kids go to school that live here?  23  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Now? They go to Reydon, near Cheyenne.  Where do you go to get groceries?  Either Canadian, Shattuck, or Elk City. Wherever you go, you buy  enough to last damn near a month if you can. (Laughs)  Does the community still get together, the people that are left?  Very seldom. They have a community dinner once a month in the  wintertime because it gets so hot in the summertime, they can   t have  one. They had one about a week or two ago, but it was so dang hot I   d  liked to had a heat stroke and had to leave. I don   t think they   ll have any  more until fall. Then they   ll have the big Christmas tree up here again.  Then they have a big get together up here at the cemetery every year, on  Memorial Day. I guess that   s about it. I can   t think of anything else.  This cemetery is called Fairview?  Yes.  Was there a town, Fairview, around here?  No, over here, a mile west of here, there was a school that was called  Fairview School. Whenever they closed it down and consolidated with  Durham, they moved the old school here, on this corner, where the  Taylor   s made a home out of it. That was what I grew up in, was that  home.  Which was a school?  Yes.  Do you have a story about the outhouse?  Outhouse?  Yes. (Laughs)  Oh, I got in trouble. Halloween, one time, there was an old German in  this country and he couldn   t speak too good of English. He homesteaded  back over here, but he had moved to Durham. He had him an outhouse  out there in the middle of   it seemed like his little ol    one room house  was in the alley. I don   t think he even owned any land up there. I was up  there on my horse, and so we decided we   d pull that outhouse over. I  roped it and I guess I started pulling on it, he went to hollering. He was  24  Wilson  G. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  in there and I turned loose of that rope and I left. A few days later my  dad came home and he said,    Mr. Woeger says he thinks this belongs to  your boy.    He brought my rope home. (Laughter)  Yes, he was a pretty tough ol    coot. He lived to be ninety-eight years  old. He smoked an old pipe and he drank wine, homemade wine. I was  always killing him quails or catching him fish and stuff, taking them up  to him. One time, we went up there and he got some homemade wine  out. He got out the sugar bowl and he said,    You better put a little sugar  in this. It   s darn sour.    (Laughter) He always walked up to Durham  every day and bought him three Pepsi-Colas and put them in a half a  carton that would hold six, and whatever groceries he wanted. He drank  three Pepsi-Cola   s a day and smoked his ol    pipe and lived to be ninety-eight.  They know those three Pepsi   s are what killed him. (Laughter)  Do you all have any questions about anything?  I wanted him to tell about his dad making home brew and it popping the  lids off. (Laughter)  Oh, yes. (Laughs)  Oh, yes. He always had to have his little toddy every morning. He had to  have a hot toddy every morning, a shot of whiskey with some water and  sugar. He was almost an alcoholic, I guess, but never a drunkard and he  would bottle a home brew every spring so he   d have a lot of beer to  drink during the summer. One time he mixed up a batch that was just a  little bit too stout. After we got it bottled   I did the capping. We had an  old home capper. About a week later, pow  Pow  Pow  Those beer  bottles went to exploding in that cellar. (Laughter)  So, did you hear it up here?  Oh, yes, you could hear them going off down there  They made a pretty  good explosion. (Laughter)  Donnie, you also forgot to tell her about squirrel hunting and how many  squirrels you ate.  Oh, yes. Yes, back in the late    30s, we   d go down in these creeks, back  north of here, and there are lots of squirrels. We always shot them in the  head and we would come home and skin them, and keep them in salt  water. Then we   d eat squirrels for breakfast   or a lot of times, two or  three times a day, for dang near all week. We   d kill about a hundred  sometimes on a weekend.  25  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Sides  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wow. How many people?  Four, eight, ten.  That   s a lot of squirrels.  Yes. It   s nothing unusual. I can remember them going across the river  and there was always a small kid that had a big slough over in there,  then. They drained them all out, now. They   d come back and we would  pick ducks until we   d have two or three tubfulls of feathers. I never did  care that much for ducks and dressing. I ate so dang many of them back  in the    30s. I ate so dang many chickens I don   t even like fowl anymore.  Oh, I need to tell you another story. The first time I remember I   m  helping butcher beef. They got an ol    fellow by the name of Tom Hatley  and he had a big, wide leather belt (to probably hold his belly in, instead  of helping his back) and he carried his pistol in that belt. He came out  here to shoot this ol    steer before we butchered it. He pulled that pistol  out and where it was against his belly, there was just as rusted as could  be, but on the front side of it, it was perfect. It looked like a new pistol.  (Laughter) I never will forget that ol    rusted pistol, lying against his  stomach.  Tell about all the quail you used to have and you and Frank   s contest.  Oh, yes   Oh, good gosh  This is against the law. (Laughter) Me and this Frank  Collins, he was an ornery little toot. Oh, he was  He was about ten years  younger than me, and he has died now. But me and him were always  getting into something on shooting contests and ranting and a raving. So,  we decided   I probably am not going to tell them what we bet   who  could kill the most quails of a box of shells, and had to take any and  every shot and if you had somebody holler, you should   ve shot that and  you had to throw a shell away. So, we went out that morning. We didn   t  even have a bird dog. In the box of shells, we came in at about ten  o   clock or something like that, and we dumped them out and we went to  counting them. I had twenty-four and he had twenty-four out of twenty-five  shells. So, we did some pretty good shooting.  Wow.  We both were a pretty good shot. So, Pat and Grace, they helped us. We  helped clean the quail and they cooked up quail and gravy and biscuits,  and we layed around there. We got to arguing about it, and we decided  we   d go out again  Well, we came in with twenty-three a piece, again.  26  Wilson  D. Chappell  Sides  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  Wilson  Wow  (Laughs)  And now, they could hunt all day long and can   t even kill anything. And  we didn   t hurt the population at all. (Laughter)  Did your dad send you after a string of horses one time?  Oh  Back in about    42 or    43   I can   t remember for sure what year     there was a fellow by the name of Bird that came through this country  buying horses for the government to go to the cavalry for World War II.  He bought about twenty or thirty head, down around Reydon country,  down in there just on south where McCoy lives, down in there close to  where Gary Sides has got a pasture down there now. They had all these  horses in my eighty acre patch. He came by here and told my dad that  he   d give me five dollars if I   d go down there, take my saddle, and I   d  ride those horses back to Durham for him. Well, boy, I just jumped at  that  Five dollars was a bunch of money  So, I went down there and he  said,    That   s one horse, there.    He   s pretty well broke to ride and we got  it caught and I saddled it up. I got them all rounded up and I rode those  horses from down there, below Reydon, to Durham. I got to Midway,  which is halfway between Durham and Reydon. There was a school  there, then, and still a grocery store. So, those horses were getting a little  tired and they all stopped there so I got off my horse, went in there, and  for a nickel, I bought a Pepsi-Cola. For a nickel I could buy a box of  crackers. Then for another nickel, I got a piece of bologna about that  thick, and that was my dinner, fifteen cents. (Laughter) But who would  send a twelve, thirteen-year-old kid to drive twenty or thirty head of  horses twenty miles, nowadays?  You must   ve been good. (Laughs)  No, we just did what we had to do. We didn   t think anything about it.  Do you want to tell about you and Ed Meeks and the cattle drive?  Oh, that was in later years. We probably made the last cattle drive that  was made out of this country. Ed Meeks is a pretty good cattleman. He  had bought a ranch, back down north of here. He had, probably, 200 or  300 head of big yearlings. But instead of going to the feed yard   I  believe it was in    54   he decided he   d send them to the Flint Hills and  run them on grass. So, we drove them from here to Higgins, Texas, and  loaded them on railroad cars, and shipped them to Flint Hills. It took us  two days to drive them up there.  What year was that?  27  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  C. Chappell  D. Chappell  C. Chappell  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  Wilson  G. Chappell  Sides  D. Chappell  Probably in    54, but I   m not positive.  I think it was later than that, because it was after we married.  Well, we got married in    53.  I know we did. (Laughter) Well, whatever, it was way back there.  Well, go ahead and tell the story about pulling the truck and the trailer  with the roping horse.  Doing what?  When you pulled the truck and the trailer with the roping horse, down  there where you all got stuck. You were telling     Oh   Oh, yes   Me and Rusty decided to go to Higgins, Texas, to a rodeo.  Oh, yes, a rodeo.  There wasn   t any road across the river or anything. I think it was fifty-one  miles to drive around and go to Higgins and it   s twenty-six miles  over there to it. So, he loaded this big paint horse up in the backend of  his pickup and we were going to cross the river and go on up there to  that rodeo. We got just over the other side of it, started up the bank, and  the ol    sand just spun out on us. He unloaded the horse and we tied the  lariat rope on the front bumper. I got on the horse and pulled that pickup,  and we went on up. Then we loaded him back up, and went on to the  Higgins Rodeo. (Laughter)  Wow.  Well, what other stories are there?  What about when you were doing your trapping, and you   d see the  rattlesnakes?  Ooh  No, that was back before I was trapping, way back in the    60s, I  believe it was. Yes, it must   ve been the    60s. I had a little .22 pistol with  a barrel about that long. (Gestures) We had a lot of rattlesnakes in the  country that year. Every time I   d be going to Durham or coming back,  28  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  I   d see a rattlesnake over near my pickup or something like that. I   d stop  the pickup, I   d level down, and I   d shoot. It was coiled up and I   d hit  them in the head. After I   d killed four, five, or six of them, I said,    I can  shoot a pistol pretty good, but I   m not that dang good  I can   t hit a damn  snake in the head every dang shot     So, I got my .22 rifle and put it in  the pickup, carried it around, and a day or two later, I saw another rattle  snake out there about twelve feet, coiled up. So, I put that ol    .22 right  up and I pulled it about an inch off the side of his head, pulled the  trigger, I hit him in the head. Those dang things will strike those bullets  if they   re looking at you and coiled up. And don   t think they can   t. I  proved it to myself  Now, I proved it right there, but I hit him right  square in the head. I was about an inch off of his head on purpose. So,  they could see that bullet and strike that because of the heat or  something, I don   t know how they did it, but they are fast   Do you still see a lot of rattlesnakes?  Not anymore, not like we used to. There was a world of them here one  time. About the biggest scare I ever had, I was sowing Milo one time  with an old A John Deere and it had a deal on it where it   d tell you high  or low range. We hung crescent wrenches, and a big wrench for a lug  wrench on it. I was sowing across this field, sowing maize, and I saw  this sidewinder coming to me. So, I popped the clutch on that ol    thing,  got both of them, got down, and I got up and just   wham    and hit him.  I said,    I believe I got him,    and I dropped back to sow again, and he  jumped at me. His mouth looked like it was that damn wide  (Gestures) I  jumped fifteen feet backwards, I know  (Laughter) It scared the tar out  of me  I   d never seen a mouth so big   Will you tell me what bulldogging a steer is, how you do it?  Okay. Way back there, there was a fellow by the name of Jim Pickett, I  think was his name. He was a negro that worked for the 101 Ranch.  He   d jump off on longhorn steers and pull them to a stop, and then reach  over their horns, and reach down and bite them in the nose, fall over  backwards, and turn them over. Well, I didn   t do it that way. (Laughter)  And the modern boys don   t, either. The way you do it now, you have a  fellow to get on this side of the steer, that you call a hazer. Then you   re  mounted on a horse on this side, and you get the steer right between you.  As you get off on him, the horse pulls you away from him, and then your  feet are on the ground. You pull the steer to a stop, you get him pulled  up, and just as you turn him, you reach down and put this hand and pull  backwards and throw all four feet in the air, and that   s your time. And if  you time it real right, he   ll throw himself. If he doesn   t throw himself,  sometimes you can   t wrestle the big cuss   s down, they   ll throw you.  29  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  What   s your average time?  The best I ever did was four seconds. Most of the ones that I won, the  big rodeo and stuff, was in the six seconds, six   one, two, three, four     six or seven. I was more or less a six second bulldogger. (Laughter)  Wow.  I didn   t know that you didn   t know what bulldogging was. (Laughter)  Well, years ago, they had what you call wild cow milking. There were a  lot of these rodeo producers that had their Brahma cows that they raised  their roping calves out of. Then in later years, they turned into bucking  bulls. Some of the best bucking bulls in the United States now come  from Tom Harlan, over here in Kelton, Texas. Whew  Charlie Plummer  ended up buying his string of stock, and some of the best bucking bulls  in the world, now, are still out of that string of stock. But anyhow,  getting back to the wild cow milking, those ol    cows were so big, they  couldn   t handle them by hand. So, they would turn them out and they  would rope them with a horse. Then they had a mugger, which would  run up and grab him by the head. They   d hold him while the thrower got  off the horse and ran up behind his hind legs and got a squirt of milk in a  coke bottle, and then got back on the horse. Then he   d ride forward and  you   d take the rope off the horns, and then he   d ride back and who put it  the fastest, won it.  Well, me and this little Dub Garver were just winning them right and  left. The last time we got into one, we were down there at Sayre. Well,  whenever I turned this cow loose, she just took right after me. I ran like  a son of a gun. As I dived over the fence, she stretched it. (Laughs) I  don   t think they ever had anymore wild cow milking like that. If they  were out here for more than two damn days, those ol    cows got mean   The wild horse races, they   d take and put a wild horse in a chute and put  a halter on him, with about a twenty-one foot rope. All three cowboys,  they   d turn them all out, maybe six or seven of them at the same time.  Three cowboys would sit on this rope and hold the horse and turn him  around. Two of them would try to go up and get a hold of his head and  his ears, and hold him down, and then the other one would saddle him.  Then they   d have to take him down there so far across the arena, and  then have to jump off him, unsaddle him, and the first one that gets the  saddle back up there won the time event.  Well, one time there was this great ol    big boy over across the river. His  name was Bub Wagnon. He stood about six foot, three or four, and he  was a pretty agile calf roper. I know Walter Coem, he was an old-time  saddle bronc rider. I was over in Shamrock, Texas   I think it was that  30  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  rodeo   and my partner, Clyde Tice, called me and said he was going to  come from Dalhart down there and meet me there, enter him in the  bulldogging, and me and him in the wild horse race, and we   d get  somebody to do the riding. I said,    Okay.    Well, a lot of times he didn   t  show up. So, I didn   t pay his entrance fees, I just paid mine in the wild  horse race.  Well, it came time for the wild horse race, he never showed. So, I went  over to this Walter Coem and Bub Wagnon and said,    I   ve done paid my  entrance fees in this wild horse race. If ya   ll get in with me, I   ll split it  with you.       Oh, boy  That   ll be all right.    I said,    Walt, why don   t you  ride?    He said,    It   ll be safer.    (Laughs) I said,    Okay. Bub, why don   t  you set the rope and let me ear him?    He said,    Oh, oh, no  Let me ear  him.    I said,    Okay, okay.    Well, we let him out and I turned him  around and set the rope. Bub went up and the horse reared up and pawed  at him and he said,    Watch him, boys  Watch him  He   s a bad one  He   s  a bad one     That big son of a gun he could whip with grizzly bears with  a switch  So, I crawled on up the rope, finally got up and got a hold of  his ears, and got him down. Here comes ol    Bub and put one arm around  his neck and one around his head. That horse couldn   t go nowhere.  (Laughs) So, I just turned loose of the rope and went around and helped  Walt saddle him, and got Walt on him, handed him the rope and I said,     Turn him loose, Bub.    Out across the arena he went. About the third or  fourth jump, the ol    horse stepped on the rope and jumped right out of  Walter   s hand. He just put both hands up, like this, and just full stroke  that ol    horse ran all the way across the arena. We ran out there and  grabbed the rope, he jumped off, we unsaddled him, went back up, and  nobody else never even saddled a horse. We won it all. (Laughter)  Wow  And that was at Sayre?  No, that was at Shamrock.  So, how many years were you rodeoing?     49 to    56, I guess. I guess. Then about ten years later, all these dang  girls went to rodeoing. (Laughter) They did barrel racing, pole bending,  goat tying     Your daughters?  Yes, three of them. (Laughs) That one there  Cherie Chappell , she won  the Top of Texas Cowgirl out there at the high school rodeo  at Pampa,  Texas . Now, I don   t even have a horse. I had a real bad windstorm here  about two months ago and it drove my ol    horse off in the ditch out  there. See where that dirt   s piled up? We were having trouble with the  31  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  damn sewers working here and the ol    boys came out here with a  backhoe and dug me a hole there. Finally, he said,    I   ll come back and  put these new laterals on here,    but he never did come back. The horse  had been around that all winter, that wind blew him off in it, and I  couldn   t find him to feed him. I finally found him and I finally got a  backhoe up here and by the time we got the hole dug out to get him out,  hell, he was dead. I may not even buy another one. If it doesn   t ever rain,  I won   t ever buy any more cattle. (Laughs) Hell, it hasn   t rained here in  seven or eight months. Also, here just a few years ago, I bought 120  head of 600 pound cutting bulls and Gary was helping me run the chute.  He said,    Now, Chap, are you going to know when to quit or are we  going to have to tell you?    And I think he   s getting about ready to tell  me.  When you were going to school in Durham, were you involved in 4-H?  Yes, ma   am.  What all did you do with 4-H?  Well, the one time I went down to the county deal, and I won the  chicken judging contest because I figured them up like I would beef, if it  was a good, square block and everything, and I won the contest of  judging chickens. I didn   t think I knew a dang thing about chickens.  (Laughs) Then I was president of the county there, one year. Then I went  to OSU for 4-H club Roundup a couple of times. I remember one time I  went down there and I   d spent all my money but a two dollar bill. I  didn   t want to spend that two dollar bill, and so whenever we stopped to  eat dinner I told them I wasn   t hungry and I stayed in the car, and I came  on home without eating. A couple days later, I was plowing and I lost  my dang bill fold and I lost my two dollar bill. (Laughs)  Oh, no   I   ve never kept a two dollar bill since then  I wasn   t about to go hungry  to keep another two dollar bill  (Laughter)  Was it because of going to 4-H Roundup that you ended up going to  OSU for a little while?  I guess so. I really don   t know how come it was. I guess I was impressed  with the place.  What do you remember about it?  Oh, renting a bicycle. I lived on a place they called Oretoopa Hall. It was  32  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  C. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Sides  Wilson  a tar paper village that they had to build for all the soldiers and we had  to go a long ways to get on the campus. Then I learned how to play  poker with those soldier boys and learned how to win their money. I  probably learned more about playing poker than I did in college.  Has that come in handy throughout the years?  Oh, yes it did. I won a lot of money while I was in the Army. I  remember one time, it was right after payday, I showed up to two or  three little poker games. There was a sergeant over there, and I showed  up another to big game or two, and they had a great big blackjack game  going. He said,    Let   s put our money together and go over there and  show up that blackjack game.    I said,    Okay.    We went over there and  we got the deal and they broke us. (Laughter) They flat did  We were  dealing and they broke us  (Laughter)  Did you want to tell about the churches that were in Durham?  Yes, there was a Baptist church. They started out by making their church  out of the old pool hall. The Church of Christ had their church in the  schoolhouse, and the Methodist church had a church house on the corner  of the schoolyard. It ended up   I don   t know what happened, but the  Methodist church that was along in the    30s, they just locked it down  and closed it up. My mother had a songbook that came from the Durham  Methodist Church and we gave it to our oldest daughter.  Yes, I   ve got that.  So, where did all the Methodists go to church, then?  Cheyenne.  Well, yes, they do now, but Glen and Cecil went to the Baptist and he  was a Methodist.  Yes, and in about    48 or    49, I helped them build the Church of Christ  there, in Durham. I hauled the sand and helped run the cement and  helped build it.  Does that still exist?  Yes.  We   ll go by there on the way home.  Okay.  33  G. Chappell  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  Sides  D. Chappell  G. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Wilson  D. Chappell  Where exactly was that Methodist church?  On the corner, across from the Baptist church, right there     That   s where I thought it was. We talked about that awhile ago.  I think the school owns that.  Yes.  They may.  Well, thank you so much for visiting with me today.  Okay. (Laughs)  I   ve enjoyed it.  I hope so  (Laughter) I probably have a jillion stories I never told you.  -------  -------
