 Little Thunder  Hood  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is September 28, 2011, and  I   m at Rance Hood   s studio in Denison, Texas, where I   m interviewing  Rance for the Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by Oklahoma  State University   s Oral History Research Program. Rance, your action-based  paintings have inspired a lot of imitators, but your art always  continues to change and evolve. I think you say it best when you say you  paint for the old people and to keep the old ways alive. Thank you for  taking time out for this interview.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Well, I was born between Cache and Indiahoma, out in the farmlands. I  was the only one that stayed with my grandparents. The rest of the kids  went with my mother and my dad. I was the only one that stayed with  my grandparents, so I   m the only one that can speak Comanche fluently.  I used to come see my dad when he lived in Burkburnett, Texas. I got  with some buddies, and we used to go bull riding, and I won a good one.  I forget where this is, west of Wichita Falls. Everybody was proud of me  because I won forty dollars and one belt buckle. I don   t know where the  money is or the belt buckle. (Laughter)  I went back to Lawton and went to see my brother in California. He got  me a job and I worked there for about a year. I don   t know. There was  something in me   I didn   t like California that much, so I came back to  Oklahoma where the Indians were, where I could learn something. I  didn   t know what I was going to learn, but I came back. First of all,  before my grandmother had died, I was trying to sketch things in the  ground with a stick, and my grandmother said,    If you want to draw,  why don   t you draw tipis like this?    And she started making Xs. So  that   s kind of how I got started, I guess.  5  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  She really kind of started you into Indian art.  Yes, and then when I went to California to see my brother, I seen a  Woody Crumbo there and,    Damn,    I thought.    Man, that   s the best  thing I   ve ever seen in my life      Now, you hadn   t seen any art in Lawton or Anadarko?  No, I hadn   t seen no kind of Indian art, nowhere. I came back, and I  started going through books in libraries, trying to find out about Indian  art. Then I ran into a guy that became a good friend of mine. He said,     What have you been doing?    It was T. C. Cannon. So T. C. and I  started running around together, and he was sketching and drawing. I  said,    Damn, I want to do some of that,    (Laughter) so we both started  painting, kind of doing our own thing. He became T. C., the great T. C.,  whom I still love. The guy that taught us, that said,    Don   t stop, and  keep going because I envy you guys,    was Lee Tsatoke. He was Kiowa.  That   s Monroe   s son. What I done was   I didn   t really stay with art that  much. I was running around and doing this and that.  So when you and T. C. felt like it, you   d drop in, and Lee would show  you a few things?  Yes, T. C. and I would go over there to his house, and he   d say,    Hey,  do you guys know how to make snow?    We said,    No, you   re our  teacher. You   re supposed to show us.    So he got a toothbrush and put  some paint on it and made snow. Man, me and T. C. looked at each other  like,    This guy   s good  He knows way more than we do.    We just  started painting. I ran into a guy in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I went  through three or four galleries there, where they signed me up for like  five years.  Had Cannon gone to Institute yet?  No. See, I didn   t know where T. C. was at the time, and I was on my  own, but when I was there I thought,    I   m going to see where the best  galleries are and try to get into the galleries.    Then I got into some good  galleries and got under contract, which I   ll never do that again because I  told them I didn   t want to do a five-year contract. I wanted to do a two-year  contract.  To give them all your work for two years.  Yes, it was a    first rights to refusal,    they called it. They checked it out  and they said,    Okay.    When I got home, I looked the contract over.  6  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  They called it the daddy long legs of contracts. It had fifteen, sixteen  pages to it. I looked at it, and I had signed a five-year contract. What I  done was I done five for them, and that   s what they really wanted: five. I  done five for them, real quick-like, and then I done my own. But on my  own, I kept that back, the real good ones that I thought was a lot better  than the ones they took.  You get caught in situations like that. I know some guys that used to  sing real good in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They were under contract like this.  The guy said,    Let me buy the contracts off you guys, and you guys will  be big, big time.    Because they   d just cut a record, which was really  huge. What they done was, he bought their contract out from under  them, and he wouldn   t let them sing. That   s no good, so I don   t go under  contracts no more. I   ve done learned my lesson on that. (Laughs)  I want to go back just a little bit because you went to boarding school at  Post Oak.  Yes, it was a small boarding school.  Did you get any kind of art classes there at all?  No.  Did you spend any time in public school at all?  I went to Cache School for probably a year. I went until the eighth  grade. That   s about all. Me and my buddies said,    Hell, we ain   t learning  nothing here. Let   s go.    It wasn   t like now. You have to go to school  now, but then, you didn   t have to. If you was a young Indian kid, you  could go down to the creek and play around all day long and ride horses  and do everything you want to do, so that   s what I done.  You have this great feeling for horses that always shows through in your  work. You talk about having horses yourself, you and your brother. Did  you have them for a long time?  Yes. We had horses when we were young. My grandfather had horses,  but his brother lived like half a mile across the road from us. We lived  out in the country, so when we felt like riding horses we   d go over there  and steal the old man   s horses and ride them to town and ride them all  over. They were kind of like our cars.  Did you get scolded for that?  No, because the horses knew where they lived. If they threw one of us  7  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  off, they   d just go on home. They didn   t wait on us. (Laughter)  When you got into the rodeo and you were riding bulls for a while, I  guess, you really get to see horses in action when you   re watching, when  you   re on top of the bull. I was wondering if you felt like that impacted  your art work?  Not really. What really impacted my artwork was, I think, maybe when I  was young and we had horses. It   s like my brother. He lived on them,  my older brother. Now he   s got two hip replacements. I said,    You rode  too many horses. I told you to ride bulls with me.    He said,    Huh-uh. I  ain   t touching no bulls, boy.     This is Kenny?  Yes, this is Kenneth, yes.  You have one sister, and you had at one point three brothers? How  many of you were there?  There were seven of us. There were four girls and three boys, I think.  (Laughter) I didn   t run around with them too much.  Because your folks were living in Indiahoma?  Between Indiahoma and Cache.  And your dad did what for a living?  He was like a bus driver in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. There   s a base there in  Lawton, Oklahoma. That   s where he came in.  So you   re growing up half-white. How did that impact you?  Well, sometimes it   s like the whites like me, and then they don   t like  me. Then sometimes the Indians like me, and then they don   t like me. So  I was kind of in the middle there, stuck. That   s why, I guess, my brother  is married to a white woman, my older brother. My younger brother,  he   s still married to a white woman, but I don   t care for them. (Laughs)  Well, there   s kind of an insider-outsider dynamic that happens with  artists a lot.  I like Indian girls, and I like half-breed girls because they kind of think  like I do. That   s just the way it is.  8  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Do you think it impacted your art in any particular way?  No, no.  What was your early style like when you and T. C. were experimenting,  when you were first starting out, after you saw the Woody Crumbo  piece?  Well, I was still doing horse and riders and trying to do the backgrounds  differently. I really didn   t know what T. C. was doing until I seen T. C.  at a powwow in Oklahoma City. We didn   t talk much about art. We  were drinking beer and having a good time, but he said he was going to  school up east somewhere at a college. He was a very smart individual.  Did he go to Dartmouth for a while?  I think so. I really don   t know. I think so. I remember when he got  killed, and that really hurt me because a lot of people like to talk. They  said,    Well, we think the girl was driving.    I don   t care who it is. If  you   re driving under the influence   you don   t know who was driving at  the time. The girl didn   t even get a scratch, and he died like he said,     with diamond-clenched teeth on the desert.    He was a smart dude.  Who were some of the artists you admired when you started out? Did  you know Leonard Riddles at all?  Yes, I knew Leonard Riddles personally, but I didn   t like his work as  much as I did Blackbear Bosin.  Yes, I can see why. (Laughs)  That was really hard to do, like the mane of a horse when they   re  running. You have the thin lines, and you   ve got to learn how to do the  thin lines. If you don   t start from the get-go, you   ll never get it. It took  me a long time to find out how to do that, and when I done it, I made a  lot of money.  So it was on your own, you just kept working on that     Oh, yes, everything was on my own. I didn   t have no instructors or  anything.  Did you know about the Institute of American Indian Art?  No, I really didn   t. I think I knew some of the guys that were going to go  at one point, but it wasn   t going to do me no good. Lee Tsatoke told me  9  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  one time,    If you paint on your own, you   ll make it.    He was right. I  made a lot more money than the guys that went to school, all but T. C.,  if he was alive. (Laughter)  Do you remember when you won your first award for painting?  Yes, Anadarko, Oklahoma.  At Indian Fair?  Yes, when I was first married. That was a long, long time ago.  What year, approximately?  I really don   t know what year it was. Another guy, he was pretty good.  He was a Kiowa, and his name was Bobby Hill. He was really good, and  I said,    Me and Bobby Hill is going to bump heads.    So me and my  wife, (I was married at the time) we went there, and they said that I had  won the Grand Award. I went,    What? You mean I beat        That   s wonderful.  Yes, and the guy congratulated me.  So you were how old, about?  I really don   t know. I was young.  You think you were twenty?  Twenty-five, twenty-six because I started painting when I was about  twenty-three. That   s kind of late, I think. I should   ve been doing it a  long time ago.  But you were apparently drawing, and you were experimenting, but you  weren   t trying to make a living.  Yes, but I didn   t use any paints. They didn   t have acrylic, then. They just  had watercolor. Everybody was doing flat stuff, and I didn   t like that. I  started putting shades to everything. I just started doing things my way,  whether anybody liked it or not.  You did the Philbrook Annual, too. You did that show.  Yes, I got second, I think. I think I got first or second, once.  10  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Was Bosin there? Were some of the guys you admired     Yes, Blackbear Bosin was there. Allan Houser was a good friend of  mine. He was there. I forgot this guy   s name from North Dakota. What  was his name? He was a Lakota Indian guy, and he was good.  He could do abstract. Oscar. Oscar Howe.  Oscar Howe. I liked his stuff.  There were a lot of restrictions even at Philbrook on Indian art.  I think I heard they wouldn   t let him in for a while. Since he was an  Indian, he was doing more stuff than just the ordinary. They let him in,  and I think he won in his category. That   s kind of what got me going a  little bit was painting against other people and other Indians. That was  good.  That competition thing.  Yes, competition thing, and getting a fat check every now and then. I  said,    I didn   t know  How cool.    (Laughter) Then I got a lot of friends  that would say,    Paint this. You ought to paint this.     They would give you ideas?  Tried to give me ideas, but I already had ideas in my head. Once I go to  sleep, the next day I knew what I wanted to paint because I   d dream  about something and     A lot of artists, when they are starting out, they   ll do those commissions  because you know it   s work that they   ll pay for, but you weren   t into  commissions too much, ever?  No. No. I   ve had a few people that asked me, but I didn   t want to stand  on a ladder all day. That   s hard work.  Oh, like on a mural or something.  Yes, a mural and this and that. I   ve had people that said,    I   ll give you X  amount of money,    a lot, and I turned them down. I don   t like that  because I   ve seen some that was real good, but they tear them down  sometimes. And sometimes it looks terrible, some of them right now. I  just don   t like that. I like mine to stay where they   re at, on canvases and  hanging in somebody   s house. (Laughter)  11  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  I think you did some mall shows. The art shows, they would have prize  money, and there would be sales sometimes. I know some of those mall  shows, like in the late-   60s, early    70s   do you remember some of  those?  Sure, I do. One of my best friends was Will Sampson, and him and I  would go to malls and paint and     Could you just set up, kind of, anywhere if you wanted to?  Yes, yes.  They wouldn   t charge you a booth rental?  No, not then. That was a different time, time zone, I   d say. If you just  put your name and say,    Hey, I   d like to come to the show,    they   d say,     Okay, you   re welcome.    I   d bring a blanket, and I   d throw it over, and  you could paint while you   re sitting there. They had beer right there, so  we   d go over there, sit down and drink beer.  Were they just Indian art shows, or were they a mixture of categories,  any kind of artists?  No, it was Indian art shows. No whites or anything like that.  What did you price your pieces at, typically?  Hundred and fifty, it was about that.  That   s a pretty good price back then.  That was pretty good. I was selling real good, and my buddy, Will  Sampson, he wasn   t selling anything. He just couldn   t sell anything. He  was always borrowing money from me. (Laughter) One day after he  made it into the acting business, he came home, and I went to see him.  He looked at me, and he says,    I know I owe you money, but I ain   t  going to pay you. I ain   t got no money.    (Laughter) So I didn   t ask him.  I said,    Well, we   re still buddies.     What were your colors, your palette, like then? Were they as bright as  they got to be, or were you working with more earth tones?  I was always like that. I hardly mixed my paints. What I liked was just  what I used. Sometimes I would add something dark, like brown to  make a red kind of brownish. Then you can see where the red would  come out brighter. A lot of people didn   t know how that was done.  12  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder     What kind of paint did you use to make that?     So were you using acrylics at that point, or are these still watercolors?  No, I started watercolor. Most of my stuff started watercolor, but when I  started with acrylics, that got different because they were hard to handle.  They were very thick, so if you   re going to do anything with acrylics,  you better know what you   re doing. (Laughter) Watercolor, if you make  one mistake, you   re through. Acrylics, it   s between watercolor and oil.  You can cover your mistakes up if you want.  Did you ever catch any flack about your use of color? You didn   t catch  flack from Indian artists, did you? Did patrons ever say to you,    That   s  not Indian art   ?  No. (Laughter) They came straight to me and said,    Boy, that   s great  Indian art     I never caught no flack in any way.  How long were you based in Oklahoma? You had been in California,  and you stayed with your brother for about a year?  Yes, and I lived with my mother for a little while.  Here in Oklahoma.  Yes, and then I went to Oklahoma City, and I stayed there for about ten  years. Then from there I came to Texas, and so I   ve been here ever  since.  How did you end up here?  There was a very rich man, a multimillionaire, that liked my stuff, and  he said,    Hey, are you ready to get out of Oklahoma?    I said,    Are you  ready to take me to Texas?    (Laughter) He said,    You bet     I said,     Let   s go.    So we hauled all the art. He had a Budweiser truck, and we  just kind of loaded it up and brought everything here in one haul.  So was he a patron, in the sense that he bought your work once you got  here?  Oh, yes. He bought a lot. He bought a lot, yes. He kept me afloat for a  long time. Once I got started here and quit Santa Fe, it   s like I get calls  all the time, or the internet.  Did you actually live in Santa Fe for a year or two?  13  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  No, I lived in Boulder for about a year or two. That was good   (Laughter)  Plus, you did that Spirit Horse for White Horse Gallery, I guess.  Yes, I sure did.  Did the owner commission that piece?  No. I was with a gal, and she was a Lakota gal. She said,    You seem like  you have medicine on you.    I said,    Well, I seem like I do, too.    We  were just kind of kidding around. She said,    You see that man walking  that way? He   s a medicine man.    So I said,    Well, let   s go see him.    I  walked over there, and I started talking to him, and he gave me some  corn out of a little bag he had. He gave me some corn. I told him I was  going to do that corn walk from Taos to Blue Lake and back. That   s like  fifteen   I think it   s fifteen miles. Anyway, when we got there, they were  already gone, so we hung around there and then went back to Santa Fe.  Things just turn out the way they turn out. I liked Santa Fe for a while. I  met a guy that could make a dollar off of his brother. He said,    Rance,  would you do this for me? Would you do that for me?    I said,    I   ll tell  you what I   ll do. I   ll cut a deal with you, if you do what I say. Get us on  the Plaza.    I said,    If you get us on the Plaza, I   ll put my work in with  you.    He said,    Okay.    So he got on the Plaza, and he gave me a call. He  said,    I   m on the Plaza.    I said,    How many paintings you got?    He said,     None.    I said,    Well, what are you going to do? I don   t have any,  either.    He said,    Well, you better get to working.    (Laughter)  He was like a dealer or a gallery owner?  Well, yes, he wanted to be in the art business, and he heard of me a long  time ago. He was a lot younger than I was. I said,    All right.    I got with  him, and we started making a lot of money. That   s the first time I made  over a hundred thousand dollars. We started making a hundred thousand  dollars like every year. People were buying large pieces, and he said,     Paint them big      So you were living in Texas at that point?  I was living here, but I was traveling back and forth on that Suburban I  had out there. That Suburban   s got 165,000 miles on it, and when I  bought it, it had probably 150. (Laughter) I ran the wheels off that thing.  We   ve talked a little about business lessons. One of them had to do with  contracts. Also, I read, early in your career you had a bad experience  14  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  with a gallery that printed without your permission.  Oh, two or three times.  So you decided to learn the printing business for yourself.  Yes and, boy, I tell you what. I   m so glad giclees are here. I   ve got a  friend that   s here in town. I can just say,    Hey, I   ve got a couple of  paintings. Do you want to do a couple of giclees on them?    And she  always says yes. She does a good job.  Do you want to explain real quick what a giclee is?  Oh, that   s hard. They   re about that round. It   s a round deal. I don   t know  how you work the buttons on it. It   s kind of like a computer, but     But more color per square inch, and better color.  Yes, and it   s a closer color. Stephen Stills  Graham Nash  is the one that  done it, and he   s a musician. He   s the one that come up with that first.  Oh, I didn   t know that. First developed and experimented with that  process?  Yes, he developed the giclee. I know him. I know Stephen Stills. I know  a lot of the rock stars.  Did you meet them through your artwork or     Yes. A lot of them wanted me to do the   you know, when they had  albums. They used to want me to put album covers for them. I didn   t do  anybody   s album cover, but  Carlos  Santana, he went and bought a  piece from me. He said,    I love it. I   m going to put this on my,    one of  these little cassettes. I said,    That   s all right.    So that   s pretty good.  These other guys that I ran around with, they   re old like me. (Laughs)  They don   t go out, playing music. They might go out playing, but they  don   t go play music. (Laughs)  When and how did you end up working at Krauss Printing Company?  There were three of us. We were buddies, and we needed money real  bad. One, he   s still alive, but he   s in the state penitentiary for life, and  the other guy is very sick. They needed me, and so we went over there,  and they said,    Y   all are hired.    We looked at each other and started  laughing because we   ve been crazy all our lives. (Laughter) We got to  doing all kinds of things they wanted us to do. They were paying us  15  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  good.  Was it a press that did mainly artists    reproductions?  No. They were doing iron-on transfers for shirts and for ball shirts and  stuff like that. I started sketching some crazy things, real funny stuff, and  they said,    Could we do that?    I said,    Well, sure.    Then we   d run a  hundred, hundred and fifty of them. I don   t know how many I done.  Would they give you like a percentage to sell?  No, because we were just having fun, and it was just a little batch of us. I  said,    Hey, I   m going to a powwow in Gallup, New Mexico. Could I  take some of them iron-on transfers?    And she said,    Take as many as  you want. You   re the owner of them. We just got the place for people to  buy them if they want.    I said,    Okay.    So I took a whole batch of them  to Gallup, New Mexico. That was the first thousand dollars I   ve ever  made  (Laughter) I liked to have died.  Wow  At the Ceremonial?  Yes, we were selling them for a dollar apiece  We got us a booth. The  booth was free. They kind of knew who I was. We were selling them for  a dollar apiece. We ran out of that, so I started making these hair bands.  I don   t know how I done it. I still don   t know how to   for women, and  it   s just the plumes. My wife went to town and bought a bunch of  plumes in a box, and I said,    Goodness  What are we going to do?    I  remember the plumes were red and blue, so I just put red and blue  together with a safety pin, and I laid them out. Oh, we started selling  them for five bucks apiece, and they were going (snaps). We were there  two days, and I made over a thousand dollars. I said,    Let   s go home.  I   m tired.    (Laughter)  You don   t know, approximately, what year that was?  No, no I don   t. I   m a big Indian. I just live through this world. I   m ready  for the next one. (Laughter)  What do you think has been one of your most important art awards that  you   ve received?  I don   t know. I got a Spur Award. I used to do the cover for Appaloosa  Journal out of Idaho, and they gave me an Appaloosa horse. I thought  that was really good. I mean a bronze Appaloosa horse. This was out  onstage in Dallas, Texas. Oh, we had a good time.  16  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Were they acknowledging the fact that you   ve done paintings for the  Appaloosa organization?  Oh, yes. This was a gift from the Appaloosa Journal to Rance Hood, and  they didn   t have very many of them. That   s what I liked about it. I can   t  think of his name, but he   s the one that done the sculpture piece. He   s a  western actor, and I remember him coming out. They said he was  coming out on his horse to make a round in Sedona, Arizona. He fell off  his horse, and they ran over there to pick him up, and he was dead. He  had a heart attack.  I think I read that the paintings that you did, which they would use as  posters, were some of their best-selling posters for the Appaloosa  people.  Oh, yes. Yes, we sold a lot. We sold a lot of Appaloosa posters.  (Laughter) Boy, people would get mad when I sold out.    Well, could  you tell him to do another one just like that one?    I   d go,    I don   t live  over there in Idaho. I don   t know them people that well. I just draw for  them.     It   s kind of nice that you   ve gotten through these different horse  magazines or western magazines. I always like to see that. It   s kind of  like they   re acknowledging Indians are cowboys, too. Indians were  really the first cowboys, and it   s nice they cover you in their articles.  Yes. They were real nice. They weren   t like certain people I run into, the  bad people that,    I   ll pay you,    and they don   t. They paid me. You   ve  got to watch that. I try to teach young artists that because they don   t  know. I didn   t know when I got into the art business. I didn   t know that I  was going to come this far because once you start selling, you   re selling  like mad, and some people won   t pay you. Here two or three years ago, I  was in a gallery in Santa Fe, and I trusted Indians. I trusted this Indian  guy with my artwork. I said,    Hey, you owe me, like, seven or eight  thousand dollars. When are you going to pay me?    And he said,    Oh, I  forgot to tell you, first come, first serve.    So I just went to the DA, and I  told them what he said. The DA snatched him up and brought him in and  said,    If you don   t pay Rance Hood in five days, you   re going to the  pen.    (Laughs) I got me a check within five days. That was pretty good.  I got all of my paintings out of his place, too. I seen a couple of young  Indian boys that had their artwork in there, and I couldn   t just walk up  and tell them because a big fight would   ve started, or something like  that.  What were the major changes for you during the    90s, in terms of your  artwork and the landscape of Indian art, selling Indian art during that  17  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  time?  See my abstract. I started doing abstract   you got to understand,  abstract   s hard. It   s like that tipi up there. The tipi is not for sale because  I could have sold it a thousand times, but I just won   t. There   s certain  things you like because it turns out right. Abstract is very hard to do.  Some people think it   s easy, but it   s not.  Why is it so hard?  You   ve got to know what you   re doing, and you   ve got to know where  to put the paint. The paint don   t stay in one place. It runs, so you   ve got  to watch what it does all the time. You have to sit with it. You   ve got to  babysit it, I guess. (Laughter) When it starts to move that way, you   ve  got to put something under there, a can, and then it starts moving this  way.    Well, that   ll be good.    You   ve got to watch it.  Okay, so you   re actually tilting the board or the canvas to get the effect  you want.  Yes, the canvas, that   s the way you do it.  Some of the ones I   ve seen that I really like, too, they have almost as  much movement as your galloping horses, in a different way. The eye is  traveling around. Sometimes when you put a fixed image in there and  then you   ve got an abstract background     That   s what a lot of people say about the eyes. I   ve had more people say,     I like the eyes of your horses,    but I don   t concentrate on the eyes. I  concentrate on the whole shebang, but I want the background to look  good, too.  In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed, requiring artists to  provide proof of tribal enrollment, or a letter of certification from their  tribe. I was wondering if you remember how that impacted the Indian art  scene, galleries, artists?  Oh, Senator   what is his name, from Colorado? Ben Nighthorse   Campbell  is the one that done that. I thanked him for it. I think he done  a darn good job because it was a lot of people, a lot of white people that  was doing Indian art. There   s still a lot of white people doing Indian art  but saying that they   re white because they don   t want to get in trouble.  They just said,    Well, that   s my own work, and I can paint anything I  want to paint.    I know R. C. Gorman didn   t like that. He didn   t like that  at all. I used to talk to him about that, and he said,    They should cut all  their heads off     (Laughter) I thought that was pretty good.  18  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  That reminds me. R. C. gave Gina Gray some tips on her signature. How  did you end up formulating your signature?  I don   t remember because I was young. I wanted something odd that  would catch somebody   s eye, so I started making a peace pipe, and out  of the smoke, I put my name in there. That   s a lot to do. That   s why a lot  of these things are not signed: because I   m lazy. (Laughter) I don   t like  to work anymore. That   s how a lot of buyers find my stuff, they said, is  through that pipe.  Before one of my younger brothers died, Larry, he was painting. He  said,    Hell with them     He done about ten or fifteen paintings real quick,  and he put my name on it, put my name on there like I do, and he went  through the Southwest selling them.    Rance told me to sell these.    They  were terrible  I got mad. I said,    I   m going to beat him up when he gets  back.    Some of the guys I was with said,    Don   t do that.    They said,     Whoever is stupid enough to buy paintings that look like that, it will  catch up with them down the line.     He didn   t ever ask you for any help or tips? Larry didn   t?  A little bit. Yes, a little bit. I told him, I said,    Do your own thing.    He  was doing a lot of my   trying to copy me. I said,    Do your own thing.  You can copy me, but move away, just kind of move away from me.     He said,    Okay,    and then he got lupus and died, lupus of the bone. I  guess that   s pretty bad.  You had a book come out in 2000, and you   re listed as a co-author. A lot  of the content is you writing or speaking about your work. I was  wondering, did you, from the beginning, know what you wanted the book  to look like and where you wanted to have control over the material?  Yes, I had control and everything. Way before that, ten years before that,  I had the same fellow, Professor John Rohner   he wanted to do a book  on me. He just kept wanting to do a book on me. I didn   t really care for  it because I was still painting and making a lot of money. I didn   t want  them buying the book instead of one of my paintings. You   ve got to  think like that. You want your work to move instead of a poster. A  poster is like fifty bucks, and you want to make 250 or 300 dollars. So  that   s what we done. It was just   it was rough.  Getting people to send in pictures of all the work? There   s a big body of  work.  Oh, the book was like   I wouldn   t go through that again. It   s hard, yes.  19  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  A couple years    process?  Yes, a couple of years, and then you   re limited. You get phone calls,     You better hurry up,    and I   m flying. I didn   t like that at all. You   ve  got to hurry. Everything is slow down and hurry up.  One of the things I really like about the book is that after talking about a  painting, you   ll put in parentheses whether your inspiration was from a  dream or from experience.  Right. I put that in there.  So that was your idea, and it   s important for you to convey that.  It was important for me to do that because of the dreams I was having.  You dream of something like a galloping horse and two or three of them  behind him. I thought of that, and then I came in here and starting  sketching it out, what I seen and what I didn   t forget. It turned out better  than the dream, some of them, and some of them don   t. That   s just the  way it is.  So nowadays, you use both acrylics and watercolor?  No, just acrylic. If people ask for watercolor, I   ll do watercolor, but you  don   t want to do watercolor on canvas, and I   m so used to canvas. It   s  better, and it   s going to last longer. I don   t know really how long acrylic  is going to last, but I   m pretty sure acrylic is going to last longer than oil  for some reason.  That   s interesting. Your skies are always really dramatic. They look to  me like they   ve got lots of layers. I guess sections of your sky have layers  of color.  Yes. Some of them are just flat, but that   s what   if you roll your brush  over them to make clouds and things, you can make a lot of clouds. You  can do anything, but you got to learn it. Once you learn it, you   ve got  her made, but that takes time. It   s like playing guitar. I play guitar, but it  takes me a long time to get what I want out of it.  I really like your winter paintings.  Everybody does. (Laughs)  There   s that struggle. There   s the struggle to survive in there, but there   s  also really a powerful spiritual element to winter. I wonder if you could  20  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  talk about that.  I think a long time ago, the Plains Indians went through a lot harder, way  harder, times than we did in tipis. They didn   t have, really, the medicine  that we have nowadays. I think they had a hard time. A lot of kids died  of influenza then. We had so many Indian doctors that they just couldn   t  take care of everybody. Some of the camps were large, so we just had a  rough time during the wintertime. That piece right there, I like that piece  there. I don   t know what it is about tipis, but I can paint tipis like that,  and they move faster than anything else. But they got to be snow   (Laughter)  They have to come with snow, huh?  Yes, they   ve got to come with snow. If I put all of this in a real nice  position, I wouldn   t sell anything. (Laughter) I had a buddy that lived  over across the river, and he had all of his paintings in line. The paints,  had them all in a line, all of them. His stack of canvases was right here,  and I said,    Do you sell any of these?    He said,    No, not yet.     That   s why he was so organized. (Laughs)  I said,    Hey, man  You go in my studio and look around. You   ll catch  on real quick     You   ve got to remember where they   re at.  Well, coming back to your horses again, it   s really difficult to do horses  in motion.  Yes.  Most of your horses, their feet aren   t even touching the ground. I   m  wondering if you work from photographs sometimes or motion studies,  or is it all in your head?  Just all in my head. I don   t work with anything mechanical or anything  like that. I tried one time, and I went,    Huh-uh.     To use a photograph?  Yes. Well, you slide a little deal in there, and you put your canvas up. I  said,    No.     Oh, like a projector?  Yes. I said   it wouldn   t work, so I got rid of that.  21  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  You do a lot of figures in twos. They   re not mirror images. They   re  different. Each one is different, but they come in pairs. I wondered what  draws you to that.  I don   t know. I know I put a lot of fours in just about every one of them  because that   s the way the Indians pray, four times. I always put fours in  there, like four feathers, he   s holding four feathers, or like on a lance,  he   s holding four feathers, or in his hair. Somewhere, you   ll find the  four, and it   s the prayer that goes with the painting. When I told this guy  that, that collects my work, oh, he goes crazy. After I told him, that   s  when he gave me that mite, that little coin during Jesus    time. Yes, it   s  really neat.  Can you talk a bit about your slash technique of painting?  That was pretty rough. I   ve got a garage out there, and it   s large, so  that   s where I do all the slashing. Let me tell you, some people like it.  It   s so weird  That   s a slashing technique, and     You   ve got your image, but you   re working on the floor?  Oh, yes, I put that on the floor, and then I take a brush, a different kind  of brush     A different size?  A different brush. It   s different size. You can use a couple of different  sizes because you can get thick, see, like that, thick, and then you can  get the thin. You just got to know how to do it. It   s a learning thing,  which is hard to do.  Do you remember when you first started doing it?  Yes. I was painting, and the paintbrush fell out of my hand and rolled  across, and I went,    Oh, God.    (Laughter) I got mad, and I just started  going like that. (Gestures) Good thing it was snow. I just kept whipping  it, and I just dumped the thing into the paint, and I   d do that. Some  woman came in and seen it and bought it. I went,    Huh?    So, hey.  You knew you had something there.  Yes, so I   d do that, too.  You   ve done a couple sculptures, I guess.  Yes. When I lived in Anadarko for ten years, I done a lot of sculpture  22  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  pieces, but they   re all gone. They were stone instead of bronze. I   ve  done a couple of bronze pieces, but that don   t get me off. I   d rather paint  and have a hard time. It   s just that way.  You were living in Anadarko in the    60s or    70s?  Something like that.  Do you do a lot of sketching or preliminary studies before you start a  painting?  Yes, I do a lot of sketching. I do sketch work and balance it out, and then  I put a couple of tapes up there, and put it up there. Blacken the back and  then put on the main subject, and then go to work, but I do the  background first. Do you know what I   m talking about? Do the  background first and then your image.  Do you always see them together, the image, or the figure, and the  background together? You always know what you   re going to put on that  background in advance?  Yes, I know pretty well what I   m going to do when I start because once  you start, you   re not going to quit. I used to quit. I was bad about that. I  could paint half of a horse and rider and go,    I quit.     Really? You could just leave it unfinished.  Unfinished, and someone would buy it, so there   s a lot of unfinished  stuff out there. (Laughter) And they   d buy it for the amount I wanted.  You grew up, from before you were born, hearing those peyote songs,  and what I like about your Native American Church paintings is you   re  not just showing us some of the symbolic elements. You really are trying  to get us to feel a bit of the feeling that comes from that ceremony.  Yes. That   s what my grandfather was. He was a road man. He done the  fire. I used to go with him when I was small, so I learned real quick.  When you   re small, you learn things, Indian things. While they   re  speaking, you understand. You know what they   re talking about. I  remember this one old man told my grandfather inside of the tipi. He  rolled him up a cigarette with, you know, the leaves they used to cut. He  rolled him up a smoke, and he told him to give him a light. So my  grandpa got a stick, and I guess everybody   s high in there. He stuck his  finger. (Laughs) That old man went    Yah     after what he done. He said,     I ain   t going to ask you for a light no more     My grandpa seen the  wrong cigarette  (Laughter) We used to laugh about that all the time.  23  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  What   s your creative routine like these days?  Sleeping. (Laughter)  You don   t have a preference for working more at night or in the  morning?  Anytime. Whenever I feel like it, I   ll take it, but if I don   t, I won   t. Now,  if something I   ve been working on isn   t finished, I   ll finish it, not like I  used to. I was real lazy, then. An artist, any artist, God blessed them with  that because you can do anything you want to. People think,    How   d  you do that?    I   ll tell them, but they still don   t know how to do it. I have  a lot of people that want me to teach them how. I said,    I ain   t no  teacher. I   m just a painter.     So you haven   t given art lessons to anybody?  No, no. I have some young kids that   s growing up, young boys, that  want to paint, and I just tell them,    Stay with it. Just stay with it.  Whether you make mistakes or not, stay with it. You   ll get it.     So what   s your creative process like, from the time you dream about  something or have an idea?  If something really comes up that   s strong when I   m sleeping or when I  wake up, and I dreamed about something really strong that I like, that   s  when I   ll grab me a canvas and go to work.  Or you   ll do your sketching and then     Yes, I   ll do my sketching, but sometimes when you get my age, you get  seventy years old, you don   t hardly have to sketch. You just go about it.  Right, you   re painting straight on the canvas most of the time. When you  think back over your career, what   s one of the defining moments, do you  think? When you went one direction, you could have gone another, but  you went this one way.  When I was about twenty-one. When I was twenty-one years old, and  when I seen that one painting of old man Crumbo   s, I knew because it  hit me in the heart. You know you   re Indian when you see something  like that and you go,    Hey, this guy is a real Indian, and he didn   t give  on his people.    That   s the way I   m going to be. I   m going to paint all my  life, whether I make a penny or not. (Laughter) I didn   t know there was  money in it. There   s a lot of money in it if you know how to do it, if you  24  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  follow the game correctly. There   s a lot of money in it.  Looking back, what do you think has been one of the high points of your  career? It might be one you   ve mentioned already, but just one of the  high points.  Selling that fifty-thousand-dollar piece. (Laughter) That was one of the  high points, I think.  That was here within the last couple of years?  It was last year. After the IRS got me, I added it up, and he really bought  it for three dollars.  Oh, my goodness.  And if I knew that, I would   ve never sold that piece, never. But, hey.  It was a surprise call, right? I don   t think we talked about the  circumstances of the sale.  Yes, it was real quick. It was very quick, but I look at myself as,    Hell, I  can do another one, even a better one.    I got the canvases in the back for  it. I seen a fellow, a friend of mine that was an artist, and he was telling  me,    I   m running out of paint, and I   m running out of this.    I thought,     Damn  I   ve never run out of anything.    When I buy canvases, I buy a  lot of them, and I buy a lot of acrylics, so I   m prepared.  That   s how artists spend their money, isn   t it?  Well, no. It   s really not that much. Well, they went up on the canvases,  but, still, it   s not that much, and the paints and all of that. When he said  that, I couldn   t understand that because I   ve got so many of them that I  don   t think of that anymore. I guess I   ve made it, and it   s     Not a struggle to have the materials.  No, not a struggle no more.  What   s one of the low points in your career?  When I signed my John Henry to the five-year contract. That   s the low  point. They duped me on that. I thought I was signing a three-year, but  they got me. I heard that even the lawyer got paid for it, too, so  everybody was after me that day. I looked. They showed me the three-year,  and another lawyer told me they slipped another one under there.  25  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood     Gotcha.    That   s what he said.  And you did fulfill it, but you were     Yes. And on the little horse that I done   you know the little horse that  most of the artists done?  Oh, the Trail of Painted Ponies?  Yes, Trail of Painted Ponies. This Mr. Barker told all the artists a big  lie. He said,    You get one of them, you give me five thousand dollars,  and I   ll give you one of them. You   ll be up to par, and whomever you   re  helping will benefit from it,    and blah, blah, blah. He just cheated  everybody, all the artists.  He charged the artists to reproduce their version of the painted ponies?  Yes. He cheated everybody, all the artists. Listen to me. He cheated all  the artists and turned around, and his own lawyer sued him. I think his  own lawyer is richer than he is now.  My goodness. I did read that your pony was one of the best-selling     It   s the best-selling, and I got two or three letters from different people  and from the people that sell the painted ponies. They said,    Your pony  was the best one, the best seller.    A John Nieto  pony , all these other  guys that   s supposed to be real good, he   s already put them to pasture. I  said,    Hey, when are you ever going to put mine to pasture?    He  wouldn   t answer me. Now, you know what I get? I get lamp shades,  something that   s made out of my horse   s head. I mean, how is he   he   s  still selling them to this day   And you don   t get a percentage?  No, never got a penny.  Well, we   re going to look at your paintings here in a minute. I wonder if  there   s anything you wanted to talk about that we didn   t get to cover, or  anything that you   d like to     That   ll be about it.  Okay.  That   s the slash technique. This painting here is the one I call The Four  Prayers because I put the peyote in there with the built-up acrylic. They  26  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  Little Thunder  Hood  look like and they feel like peyote, the hard, dried up ones. That   s the  prayer, and this little line here is your lifeline. And the peyote men in the  tipi, if you passed the chief and go down here, it stops them where   the  guy who   s looking at it knows when he   s going to die. This side I done  abstract like Jackson Pollock. That   s all the things that   s in your mind  and where you   ve been and things like that. You know what I   m talking  about? It   s one of my favorite pieces.  It   s really wonderful. Yes, I love that built-up quality.  It   s a sixty by seventy, and that   s pretty large, vertical. Of course, I  didn   t sign it. I put everything on there. It took me probably two months  to do, and then I put the hand in it. I put all of this little stuff. You can   t  see it real good with the deal you got, but that   s horse hair. I done the  shield, which I   m still working on. That   s why I come in and I look at it  a lot. I was just telling  you  earlier, I sold one for fifty thousand dollars  that sat here for about two years. I wasn   t finished with it yet, and he  bought it for fifty grand. So don   t ever finish a painting or you won   t sell  it  (Laughter) The background changes sometimes. In different lighting  it changes dark to light green, turquoise, and it   s got the bells and the  beaded deal on the horse neck. Martingale, they call that. That   s one of  my better pieces.  Right. That is just really nice.  This piece here is an original Rance Hood-style painting. You have all  the gravel and everything that looks like gravel. The horse, which is  black, but looking blue, I kind of done him as a Comanche. You can see  all the eagle feathers he   s holding, and the lance, which is the prayers  that he has in his heart. On the horse, he   s got a skull of a buffalo, which  we were raised on a long time ago, and certain markings on the face and  everything. That   s about it.  Just really a wonderful piece, too. Thank you so much for your time  today, Rance.  Thank you. You   re welcome.  -------  -------
