 Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Today is Thursday, November 18, 2010. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh,  and I am with Barbara Abrash and we are at the Stillwater Public  Library following the dedication of the Angie Debo Statue outside the  library. We are here to talk more about Indians, Outlaws and Angie  Debo, of which Barbara is the co-producer. I think before we talk about  that Barbara, can you just tell me a little bit about how you first became  acquainted with Angie Debo and got the idea that this would be a good  project for a documentary film?  Well, I was very interested in documentary film and also in women   s  history and in history from the bottom up. I was very excited by the  historiography that had begun in the late    70s and the early    80s about  telling the histories of marginalized people, and those histories in their  own voices. I was working at a place called the Institute for Research in  History, which was dedicated to the work of independent scholars     women scholars. One night, very late, I got a call from Cambridge,  Massachusetts, and a colleague of mine from the Institute was on the  phone. She was a Bunting Fellow at Radcliffe, and so was Glenna  Matthews. Glenna had been talking about the oral histories that she had  done and my friend, knowing that I was interested in documentary film  and in history and in women, thought that it might be a good subject for  a film. So I read some of Angie   s work and I was kind of blown away,  and of course, that subject hit a lot of notes for me because she not only  was a historian, she was a woman historian who had been so blocked in  so many ways, but had found a way to be eloquent, and across time to be  very influential.  I was really interested then in doing the film, but I felt that the film  couldn   t be done unless there was someone from Oklahoma who really  understood and respected the culture, and who shared my interest in  women as subjects. I had met Martha Sandlin, who had made a film that  I admired a lot   I think she either made it in film school or shortly after.  5  Paustenbaugh  It was called A Lady Named Baybie, and it was about a blind woman that  lived in New York and was kind of a wonderful, outrageous,  independent woman living sort of on the edge. And it was just so full of  openness and real insight and skill that I was really interested in working  with Martha. Martha had been born and raised in Oklahoma. I think her  father had been in politics here, and she was very interested, she thought,  and she did want to come out for Prairie City  Days , for that parade in  1983, which is when all this began. We had very little money, and she  took what money we had, we agreed that she would come and film that  and get to know Angie, which she did, and she shot that parade, which  you see in the film. When she came back we started fundraising in  earnest.  Gloria Valencia-Weber, who was Glenna Matthew   s colleague at OSU,  the two of them were just essential. They were real partners on the  project, obviously, and Gloria was running the diversity program here,  she was in the Psychology department, she   d been very close to Angie in  developing the Oklahoma Civil Liberties Union. And Glenna, of course,  had come from California, and she had kind of a wonderful optimistic  view of the possibilities, and having found Angie, was very, very excited  about that. And she was excited about Oklahoma. She was going around  giving talks for the Humanities Council and very, very good spirited,  bringing a whole kind of energy. So the two of them were important in  helping us start to raise money, and it was very, very tough. When I  went to New York foundations that I have some contact with, they  would say,    Well, if she ever mattered, she would   ve had a good job,  wouldn   t she?    Or,    She   s from Oklahoma,    as though it was not part of  the universe.  So it was really disheartening in the beginning, but it increased our  resolve because it was kind of replicating the problem in some way, or  demonstrating that problem. Slowly we began to get donations from  individuals. Gloria and Glenna helped us get a little bit of early money.  Anita May and the Oklahoma Humanities Council was essential. The  most helpful person was  then Oklahoma state senator  Penny Williams.  We were here on a shoot, of course it was very tricky filming Angie  because her energy levels were up and down and because her daily  schedule was very complicated, and it was very exhausting for her. So it  was very noble of her to be doing this at all. And I remember it was one  of those times that it seemed impossible to make the film. Somebody  had given me Penny   s phone number, and I called her from a pay phone  by the side of some highway and she said,    Angie who?    She said,     Well that sounds kind of interesting, I   d like to know more.    She  became a very, very active part of our fundraising.  So it sounds like you were the one that sort of got her interested in  6  Abrash  Angie.  Well, any time she had met Angie, she would   ve been interested, it just  happened that I brought up the subject and gave her that opportunity.  And then there were several women in Oklahoma who sort of became  interested in the film because people knew each other, as happens on  these films, and they helped us get money from some foundations,   15,000 here or  25,000 there. And then other people from Oklahoma  really were helpful. Gail McDonald, I don   t know if you know Gail  McDonald, but she   s in Washington now. She was very helpful in  Washington, introducing me to people there. I   ll think of other names.  There were just so many people here who really made it happen, and it  was Oklahoma women, I think, who deserve almost all the credit for  that, and the men who were sympathetic, interested in Angie   s work.  Toward the end, when it really became quite critical to raise the money  and extremely desperate to raise the money, I would say, it turned out I  think through Gail McDonald, although she would have to confirm that,  Oklahoma Gas and Electric  actually, Consolidated Natural Gas  Company (Foundation) , you   ll see their credit on the film, were  interested in helping to finish the film, partly because the person who  was influential in that company had a mother who reminded him of  Angie, and he had had a prairie kind of education that resonated with  him, and because they had found some gas fields, and they were going to  be doing something in Oklahoma and they wanted a calling card of some  kind. By that time we had arranged to have a screening at the National  Gallery for Women   s Art  National Museum of Women in the Arts  or  something like that in Washington, and Senator  David  Boren came, a  lot of the men came, and the gas company had helped finish the film and  they helped launch that party.  In the mean time, I wasn   t quite sure how the film was going to get  finished financially, and in desperation I called Judy Crichton. She had  just started planning American Experience, I had read that somewhere. I  looked her up in the phonebook, and I called her. She was just putting  that first season together, and I knew that she was a woman with a heart,  and that she would not, in any way, minimize the story. And she  accepted it for American Experience. I went to see her, we talked, then  Martha and I went to see her, and we talked some more, and she took the  film. She invested heavily in the film, and she worked very much on the  narration and on finishing the editing of the film.  When it came up before the committee of American Experience in  Boston, it came up against the same question,    Well, she never had a  job, certainly not here in Boston, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma,    and so  forth. One of the young women working on the project was in the room,  7  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  and she stepped out and she called the chair of Western History at Yale,   Howard Lamar , and she said,    Have you ever heard of somebody  named Angie Debo?    He said,    Yeah, she   s the greatest historian of  American Indians in Western History,    and proceeded to say what many  of the men this afternoon said about her role. This intern came back,  wrote a note to Judy   it was imprimatur that they needed, and then  that   s the reason that it got broadcast.  When it came to broadcast, the question was who would narrate? That  maybe it needed a male narrator to give it some authenticity. I think  Robert Redford was mentioned, and that was something that Martha and  I really disagreed with, and they finally accepted the narrator that they  did, the voice of a woman who was     Rhonda Coullet?  Yes, kind of authoritative as a news voice, in a way, telling this story.  And Judy had a lot to do with finishing the film, finishing the music and  kind of giving it surround and panache, and in return for investing  almost fifty percent of the budget, WGBH quite rightly owns the film.  And basically, we were here for two or three shoots. We were always  worried about the weather, we were always worried about Angie   s  energy. She was incredibly generous, and when we asked her if she  wanted to see a rough cut, she said,    No, this is your story, not mine, and  it   s your responsibility.    I think she trusted the team, in a lot of ways.  Aletha Rogers, who had worked on oral histories with Glenna and  Gloria, was doing sound for us. Certainly Martha was just the right  person to work with Angie; she really, really understood Angie very  well, and she   s extremely perceptive. I think that the fact that I worked  with the Institute for Research in History, which she trusted as being  history that she would trust, made a big difference.  She really gave us access to everything, and some of these stories, when  she was telling us the story of  Edward Everett  Dale, all of us were  crying. I think Aletha had to stop the sound recording, and  Angie   looked around and she said,    Why are you crying, silly girls? This has a  very happy ending. The book got published.    You know, she had a very  steady view of things, and a long view of things. She was interesting  because she was very clear, she was very political, and she was very  non-ideological. She saw things the way they were, and she valued  people for who they were and what they did, and she valued everything  for the good of it. They were talking this afternoon about her riding  horseback in a split skirt. She said that she got to ride that horse to  school because her father would always keep the animals after they  weren   t work animals anymore. He would keep them for the good they  had done. And I think that sort of pervaded a lot of her life. Just, the  8  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  good that people could do was what value she gave them.  I saw the original prospectus for the film, and it indicated that it was to  be a half-hour film. It also had the title Still Waters, and I was just  curious about when you realized that you had a story that couldn   t be  told in a half-hour, and who was responsible for changing the title?  Well, after awhile, clearly that title doesn   t apply to Angie. It might  apply to a lot of things, but not to Angie. She wasn   t still waters, she was  something quite different. So as soon as we got to know her and her  work, the title kind of went out the window. When we got into the story,  it just seemed that a superficial half-hour story would be pointless, and it  was probably Martha who first really understood that there was a very,  very profound story here and that it would require much more than half  an hour. A half an hour would be something like a magazine piece and it  took a little more. It was very, very difficult, the whole thing was very,  very difficult for so many reasons. Partly because of her age, partly,  when you go to tell a story like hers, what are you going to choose to  tell? Martha was the person who made the decision that what mattered  about Angie was her scholarship, and it had to be about the books, and  her relationship with the books. And that   s what she took out of it, which  is absolutely right, and why the piece had to be much longer, because it  wasn   t about a woman of some age living in a small town in Oklahoma  who had written some stuff. I mean, it was something quite different.  There was not a lot of material for some of it, and it wasn   t necessarily  all very dramatic in terms of her career. At lot of her stories, just, you  could tell it as a very hard story about her brother dying young, about  her family, which, to many of us, was like the other American story  about the family that goes from place to place and never has the  American Dream. Her father had the farm, they didn   t have the farm, he  then had a creamery, or business, or something like that. But they didn   t,  I mean, they   re very, very hard economic times.  She talked about when she had that job in Texas, that was a humiliating  period. We did not want to talk about her humiliations, even though she  didn   t describe it that way. She was really treated abominably badly, and  she only had that job and took it because she couldn   t get another, and  she needed the money and she needed to help her family out. That   s not  what she was about in the long run, right? And there were a lot of other  sub-themes that didn   t apply at all. There were people who wanted her to  be a certain kind of feminist, but she was a woman who did her work  and cared about equality and cared about justice and whether it was men  or women, you know, you should all work hard and go for equality and  justice. And Jane Addams was a hero, Kate Barnard was a hero, you  could say that there were women that had inspired her, but she never put  it in terms that would be those of contemporary feminists of the    80s,  9  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  and that was another thing, trying not to put that layer on her, to have her  in her own time, in her own terms, and that too was in her scholarship. It  was in her books.  I know that you saw some of the questions that I was going to ask you,  and one of the questions that I had was did you or Martha at any point  in time believe that the film wouldn   t be completed? You said that wasn   t  an option     Really, once you have engaged that many people and taken their trust  and taken their money, you have to finish the film. We wanted to finish  it well, but there was no question that it would have to be finished.  Well then, I guess Judy Crichton   s interest in it must   ve seemed like a  godsend at the particular time that it happened.  Absolutely.  I read that Angie received a copy of the completed film in the mail on the  day that she died. That seems a little dramatic to me.  I think the story actually is that Gloria was going to visit her, and we had  sent Gloria a copy and Gloria was going to show it to her.  I see.  So the mail may be a little more dramatic, but    (Laughter) Pony  Express coming in with the film.  But the point was that she never had the opportunity to view the film.  No.  How do you think she would   ve seen the film?  First she would   ve looked to see if we   d gotten the facts right. Then she  would   ve looked to see if she looked alright. (Laughs) And then she  would   ve said it was our work and our responsibility. I think that she  believed that her story had been heard. She knew that Gloria and  Glenna, in whom she had absolute confidence, were working very  closely with us, and I think she felt well taken care of.  So what does it feel like, the night before a film that you   ve spent now  five years working on is going to air on national TV? What is that like?  I think it   s maybe like when your kid goes off to college. You   ve done  10  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  your best, you hope it works, you don   t know how people are going to  see it, or what its life is going to be like, and there it is. And that   s how I  felt about it. I think that we had made a lot of compromises on the film  for what was available and for what we could afford and what others  needed to have in the film, and then there it was. I think one of the most  extraordinary things is that you and others are still interested in that film  twenty-two years later. The other thing about it that was enormously  gratifying is that I still get calls and letters from Indians all over saying  that they want the film, how can they get the film, they teach with the  film, their VHS is out, and of course, because of the rights, WGBH  never continued   we sold thousands of copies of the film when it was  still with PBS video, so the fact that you   ve done what you   ve done  makes an enormous difference in the life of the film and the world. And  I think that that   s what we were hoping. The broadcast, in a way, is an  important calling card, but the fact that it was out there, and that the  most amazing range of people have seen it and used it and cared about it  is what really matters about it.  I agree with you on that. What was the early feedback on the film at the  time?  It got a very big audience. It was very, very much appreciated and  admired by people who were interested in women   s lives, in Indians and  in history. Scholars tend not to like it because it   s not analytic, and there  are some people who still don   t understand why a woman who never  could get a decent teaching job is the subject of a film, which is  something we tried very much to do, but I think that   s how it broke out.  People for whom the story mattered and that person matters appreciated  it very much.  I think one of the things that   s really fascinating to me is that the  American Historical Association did a study in 2008 where they looked  at the number of women historians that had academic positions. I mean,  I think that   s really the only thing that they can look at and gather any  statistics, and how comparative fields in the humanities and the social  sciences, depending on how you see history, so they looked at both of  them, that there still are far fewer women in the field of history than  there are in other humanities and social science disciplines. They had  been making progress up until about 2000, and now the numbers have  sort of slacked off. We think we   ve made a lot of progress in this area,  and we still haven   t.  Well, as Penny was saying, you push that stone up the hill, and then  sometimes that stone starts rolling down again.  Yes, that   s really true. I guess I was just really surprised by that.  11  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  It   s not true at NYU. I don   t know.  I don   t think it   s true everywhere, because we certainly have a fair  number of women in our history department that are tenured, but  nationally it is a trend, so it   s interesting that it   s still a discipline  that   s     You could understand it in the early years when history really was about  the military and about government and about levels of power, and then  women really began coming into the field when the family was  understood to be a subject of history and other things, but I don   t know.  It may have something to do with the job market. I couldn   t really say.  I thought that that was a surprising statistic.  Discouraging, very discouraging.  So how did knowing Angie change you, or knowing her story? Do you  feel like it changed you in any way?  It relocated a lot of values for me, because she was very focused, and  she knew what mattered, and she knew what her calling was. She really  had a calling. And she was not at all about, it   s not that she didn   t have a  very healthy ego, I think she had a very healthy ego, but her world was  not the world of competition and fame and the kinds of things that the  profession sort of traffics in, or invites or requires in a way, and so it  really brought it down to basics. There were many, many things aside  from her history that were very telling and continue to be telling for me.  Her role in the town. The fact that whatever work was to be done   I  think they mentioned today, she was a minister during WWII, she taught  Sunday school, she did all of these things in the town because she was so  civic minded. Glenna really nailed that, I thought.  There were also things in the town that she did, for example one of the  farmers in the town, his son went off to the Peace Corps, and he was, I  believe, in West Africa, I   m not sure. He wrote and he said he was  coming home and it had been wonderful and he had a big surprise  because he was bringing a wife with him, a bride with him. And Angie  talked about this friend of hers and his wife coming over, full of  consternation, really wanting to welcome a happy marriage, but very  concerned about how the town would accept it. And they didn   t want  their son or his wife to feel in any way excluded. And Angie said,    It  was a Sunday night, and I knew Marshall, and I knew that everybody  wants to come to the party, and so I said we were going to throw a very,  very big welcome home party, and everybody would want to come  because nobody would want to be left out. And once they came they  12  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  would be welcoming the couple.    And it was so much part of how she  did everything, about inclusion and going for what people really want  and need, and what makes them feel coherent somehow. And she did  that over and over again, in so many ways, in very strategic ways.  And then, of course, when she was working with the tribes when the  Havasupai asked her to come and consult, what she could bring to that,  and she would do that very strategically and very humbly. You know,  it   s like just how people are with each other. Never presuming to go  beyond any lines, but always knowing what would actually make  something work. And she made her life work that way and that was  incredibly important. When she had a little money and she started  traveling, after she got royalties, her friends in East Africa, the families,  and the way, when there was trouble, I think it was in Uganda but it may  have been Kenya, and she wanted to send food and clothing, and she  found this priest in a neighboring country that would get stuff in in a  way that it would not harm the people that it was going to, and to make  it useful to them, and how she kept those things going. That took a lot of  real strategizing. Real thinking. But the things themselves were not  things that would make it into People Magazine.  I always thought that it was interesting how many international students  at OSU would spend weekends in Marshall.  Well that was another thing, the way she would do the Thanksgiving  thing. And she would mobilize the town in it, so people down in  Marshall had more connections with foreign families and foreign  students than your average town of 350 people.  Right. Definitely more than your average town of 350 in Oklahoma.  Yes. So the way she could do those, bring things together in very  normalizing ways that, whether it was Thanksgiving or a welcome home  party or whatever it was, it was how you really keep building  community, I guess.  That   s a gift, really, to be able to do that.  It also takes a kind of confidence to do a lot of the things she did. I  mean, she was really a leader, a different kind of a leader somehow. I  don   t know that she would   ve called herself that, but she could really  make things happen.  Can you tell me anything about projects you   ve taken on since Indians,  Outlaws, and Angie Debo?  13  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Well, I produced a film about miners in Donetsk, right at the end of  Perestroika. Donetsk is a city in the Ukraine that was created by Stalin  because it was an industrial city. These were very, very highly paid  workers in mines that were pretty well worked out by this time, not very  safe, and when the government came down, their union had been a  branch of the Communist Party. The workers really wanted to have their  own thing, and they were really trying to reorganize themselves in a  different way, so I produced a film about that  called Perestroika From  Below . And then I did an experimental film about Margaret Sanger, and  how Margaret Sanger used the press to make contraception a word that  the papers could use, among other things, and reproduction, and that still  is in distribution. Both of those are still in distribution many years later.  The most recent film that I worked on was about a parent organizing for  local public schools in inner cities, and that was released last year. I  consult on a lot of films, but mostly now rather than producing films I  run this media center  The Center for Media, Culture and History  at  NYU, and we are very interested in the social uses of media and how  people are using media to represent themselves and their issues. We   re  very interested in disability issues, indigenous people   s issues, that kind  of thing.  How long have you been in that capacity?  I   ve been there seventeen years. A long time.  A long time, that is. So do you feel like there has been a unifying theme  in the films you   ve made?  I   m always interested in how media can be a tool for people who are  trying to achieve some kind of social justice   a social issue  documentary is really what I   m most interested in. The difference  between what I was doing in 1988 and now is that documentary film is  no longer just a text or an artifact, but it really is something that has so  many platforms for distribution and so many opportunities to engage  different communities and to be available to them, that they   ve become a  resource rather than a text. That   s a huge difference, and I   ve written  quite a bit about that in terms of memoir films, in terms of social issue  documentary, for many years now. That really interests me a lot.  Well I think, especially as I think about Indians, Outlaws and Angie  Debo, one of the reasons that we were so interested in seeing it, I guess,  have a new life as a digital film, people aren   t interested in video  anymore, they want DVDs.  They don   t even make those  VHS  machines anymore.  14  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  And thinking about how complex Angie   s work is, if you   re a casual  reader, it   s not easy to get through, and yet what she had to say was so  important, and I think that our thought about making this available in a  digital format was the very best way for a new generation of  Oklahomans to know about her, because she seems so accessible in that  way.  I appreciate that, and I think that   s right. It would be nice if we could  chapter the film so people could go to specific places on the film. I don   t  know if you   re going to be able to do that at all, but for teaching it  makes it much, much easier.  Right. Well one of the things that we plan to do, because we do have  some fear of sending it to public schools, to the library, and then the  teachers don   t know about it, and then the teachers, like teachers  everywhere, have far more on their plate than what they can handle, so  we are creating some curriculum guides that are tied to the Oklahoma  teaching standards, so that there   s an easy     Could I see those? I   d be really interested in seeing those.  Well yes, when they   re done, we would be delighted to show them and to  get your feedback, but in Oklahoma, that   s really a key is to have  something that the teachers say,    If I show this film, we do this  worksheet, so we can accomplish this, this, and this standard that   s in  the PASS curriculum        Absolutely, that   s the only way to go, because teachers are just so  overwhelmed. And if you can plug it into the curriculum, then it really is  a double favor to them, I think. I guess there   s no way of involving the  public television station?  Well, that   s something that we have considered. I would really love to  show it a few times in Oklahoma on OETA as a way to reintroduce  people to the film and to let them know that it   s available at their public  library, at their tribal library, that their children will have access to it.  Something that some stations do, many public television stations, one of  their mainstays is the education piece. I don   t know if OETA is doing  that, but especially for high schools, I think, and maybe junior colleges,  to make that available, that the station might find it a useful resource.  Yeah. This is brand new territory for us. (Laughs)  Well, I   ve been working for the past few years on a public media  project, and I was just thinking about how stations have tried to build  15  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  local constituencies, and schools are one of the best ways to do that. It   s  kind of an association that public media has always had, and it   s kind of  trusted in the schools, and if it can be lined up with curriculum, then it   s  really great. Something, I don   t know if you   d want to look at it, but  WGBH in Boston has something called Teacher   s Domain, which is an  incredibly well populated site that they   ve been running for many years  now, and it may offer either some models or some thoughts about how  to do this.  One of the things that we were interested in is that most of the films  early on in the American Experience series came with a curriculum  guide that was folded in it, and I   ve actually seen those curriculum  guides for other films in the series. None of our Indians, Outlaws and  Angie Debo films have them, and we   ve asked other libraries in the state  that have the film to look inside and see if it   s there     They don   t have it?  They don   t have it either, and PBS didn   t even know what we were  talking about when we asked them for it.  Of course. Of course. (Laughter)  So I don   t know whether there just wasn   t one produced? It certainly is  an elusive thing.  I don   t have one either, and I don   t remember whether one was  produced, actually.  Well I thought maybe you would remember, and have I been and seen  them for some of the other films. I was in a school library recently where  the librarian showed me those and she said,    Why doesn   t this one have  it?    And the marketing materials for it said that the film had one, so I  don   t know where it is.  I can look at NYU   s copy and see     Twenty-two years later. (Laughter) Well, I feel like you gave me a really  good overview of how the film was produced and some of the questions  that I had planned to ask you, you had incorporated answers to in telling  me how the film came to be, but is there anything that you would want to  tell me that I didn   t already ask you about?  One of the interesting things in making the film was the response from  some of the Apache people, Muscogee. Many of the Indians that we  interviewed really got it about Angie, in a very interesting and very  16  Paustenbaugh  Abrash  direct way. And it sort of didn   t have any other overlay on it, and people  who were not, I don   t think, particularly happy to talk to a couple of  New Yorkers who flew in. Sunshine King was one of those people in  Muskogee, and that was one of those things that gave me a different  sense of the film, about   you know, academics talk about things, these  people were talking from experience, from a different experience, and  that, I think, gave the film a kind of heart beat. And seemed very aligned  with what was important to Angie, that she was their scribe, in a way,  but it was more than just recording their story. And she was interested in  how history worked in a certain way. I remember asking her about this  ethno-history thing. You know, what made her aware of the fact that  culture was a source of historical information. She really looked at me  like I was a little bit slow-witted. And she said,    Well you know, dear,  Herodotus did it.    And so she had this great breadth of historical  understanding that she brought to life in a very particular way that was  connecting today. I think she felt very much a part of that stream of  people who told the truth.  Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
