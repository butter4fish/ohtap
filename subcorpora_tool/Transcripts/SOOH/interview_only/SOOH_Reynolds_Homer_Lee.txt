 Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Today is March 2, 2012. My name is Lynne Simpson and I   m on the  faculty of the Oklahoma State University Library. I   m in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma on the campus of Langston University-Oklahoma City to  interview Homer Lee Reynolds, Sr., as part of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program   s Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history  project. Our topic today is Boley, Oklahoma. Could you tell me when  and where you were born?  I was born in Okemah, Oklahoma. We resided in Clayton Chapel  Community. So, that   s about five miles east of Boley, but I was born in  Okemah Hospital.  Could you talk a little about your youth and where you grew up?  We grew up on a forty-acre farm and ate real good. (Laughs) We killed  our own beef and pork and raised our own vegetables. My mom, she  canned about 400 quarts a year for the summer, and she raised twelve  children. I was number eleven, so I was called, I guess, the gambling  child or whatever the number eleven. (Laughs) But we were raised very  well, Christian background, very stern parents. It   s just a great family. A  lot of love. A lot of love.  Growing up on the farm, what were some of your chores?  Some of my chores were, I guess, the first part of the morning was  getting up and feeding the chickens and making sure that there were no  eggs left from the day before. So, we would have to stick our hands into  the box where the chicken nest was, and sometimes there were surprises  in the summer. Yes, like snakes or whatever. (Laughs) Yes, and then we  also had to milk a few cows in the morning for our butter and cream. So,  I grew up kind of, naturally, a farmer, very strong, all my brothers and  5  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  sisters. My sisters didn   t have to do all that, but we had to cut our own  wood. Those are some chores, feeding the cattle. We raised horses and  sold some beautiful horses. And we didn   t like to see them go, but there  was a guy from Texas that came up and bought our quarter horses. Yes,  some of them raced.  Do you still ride horses?  I still have three horses, yes.  And were you in 4-H or FFA?  Yes, ma   am, I was in 4-H and FFA. We went to Oklahoma State  University, I think, it was my freshman year. We spent the night for the  convention, me and a classmate, Anthony Wilcots. Cleveland Bell is  who took us up there and John Gonzalez. Those were Boley guys. They  were seniors so they took us under their wings.  Very good. Could you tell about your educational background, starting  with elementary school?  Yes, I started at the community school called Clayton Chapel. There was  a community school about two miles west of Clayton Chapel called  Chilesville. There was also a community school about three miles east  called IXL. I went to Clayton Chapel my first two years and then we  moved to   they closed Clayton Chapel. We moved to IXL Community  School, which was one through, I think, seventh or eighth. I think it was  eighth. Then from there, you went to Boley. So, Clayton Chapel,  Chilesville, IXL, we all went to Boley starting our freshman year. But  they closed IXL down about my fourth grade   fifth grade year. So, I  went to Boley my fifth grade. That   s where we met all the other  Boleyites. (Laughs) A lot of times, we didn   t know any of the students  except for kindergarten. Then I was able to reunite with some  kindergarten friends, like,    Hey, you know       So, we saw them and  that   s where I really started Boley, for fifth grade.  About how many were in each class, just an average size?  In my first school, we had three or four first-graders. In the second   my  auntie was the principal, Essie Williams. She was the principal of the  school, and Deanna Hayes was our teacher. She was like the fourth,  fifth, and sixth, and Deanna Hayes was the first through the fourth. So,  we only had two teachers, that I can remember, that handled all the  students. But they had us in sections. One big classroom. We had one  good cook and her name was Mrs. Bass. Mrs. Bass was our cook,  cooking the big biscuits and the peanut butter and syrup and all that. It  6  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  was really good. We ate really good. Then when you got into the IXL  community, it was more students. It was like thirteen in my class. And  then you went into Boley, it was more, like twenty-six to thirty. It ended  up, I think we graduated with a total of maybe sixteen or so, because  several left. Their families were leaving Boley, going to Oklahoma City.  We lost several students our freshman year in high school.  What year did you graduate?  1979.  Okay, so it was at that time that people were moving.  Yes.  Who were some of your favorite teachers, if that   s okay?  Oh, wow. Yes, that   s okay. Like I said, Mrs. Deanna Hayes was my first  teacher and then Mrs. Nash was my second teacher, I   d say third and  fourth grade. Then you had Mrs. Owens   I   m trying to think of her first  name. We didn   t call first names back in the day. (Laughs) Mrs. Owens  was my fifth and sixth grade. Then we had Mrs. Rutherford. That was  one. I think she was fifth before we went to fifth and sixth because they  split us up. Ivory Owens, that   s her name. But also, a teacher that stood  out in my high school was Mrs. Venters. She was Colleen Mixon  Venters. She was our sponsor. Great inspirational lady. Took good care  of us. Taught us how to work in the real world, apply for jobs. Took us  to OSU and OU to visit the schools. So, those are some   and I can   t  leave out Cousin Velma Ashley. (Laughs) She was the German teacher,  and she came in and sat in for Mrs. Venters as a sub, and she taught us  German. We had to cite German and German poetry.  How many foreign languages did you have at Boley High School?  We had German. That   s all I remember.  Who else have been among your role models and what do you admire  about them?  Well, my coach. I guess my first coach would have been Mr. Stanford.  He allowed me to be on the junior varsity. I was in the eighth grade and  you weren   t really allowed on junior varsity, but I was the only eighth-grader  that was allowed on the junior varsity. He told me that I would be  a great player some day. I had brothers that played very well and did  really good in school. Then Mr. Quinn was my freshman year coach, and  I played a lot of basketball my freshman year. Sometimes the sixth man  7  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  off the bench and wasn   t liked by all the players sometimes, but you  know, it   s just a freshman trying to make it. Then my sophomore year I  became captain of Boley High School for three years.  That was big. Yes, that was a big honor, the Boley Bears.  I had three queens. (Laughter)  The captain of the Boley Bears, that   s a big honor.  Big honor.  How did your family come to live in Boley?  We never moved to the Boley area. We were still in the Clayton Chapel  Community. So, we stayed there and the bus transported Clayton  Chapel, Chilesville, IXL. There was a bus for Rusk, a bus for Sand  Creek, a bus for the IXL area. They bussed us all.  How did your family come to live in Clayton Chapel, then?  Oh, from they call it    over across the river,    which was Cromwell. My  mother grew up in Cromwell, Oklahoma, the Stallworths. My dad came  from the Clearview area. But when they met in Boley, that   s when they  met, and I guess they were inseparable. (Laughs)  How many generations back is your family in that Okfuskee County  area?  Well, my dad and his parents, I looked in the genealogy, and they moved  in 1920. Let   s see, Daddy was born in 1918 so they moved in 1924,    23  or    24. He was three or four years old. They moved to Clearview,  Oklahoma from Paris, Texas. My mother   s parents were originally from  I think it was Alexander, Alabama. Of course, they moved to Cromwell.  That would be her childhood. She was born in 1918. I would say she  was born there. Yes.  Okay. How did your family make a living?  My father was a construction man and he worked with Tinker part of his  life. He did a lot of side jobs, but he also   we harvested peanuts. That  was real big back in the day. We had our own combiner. Well, actually,  we didn   t have a combine, that was the Roseburrs    combine. Mr. Johnny  Roseburr, he would allow all community farmers to use his combiner to  harvest. Sometimes we were out two weeks of school to combine our  crops to pay our notes for the whole year, because they were yearly  8  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  notes. How I know that is because I was kind of into the business part of  my mother   s life. So, yes, we combined peanuts and that was just a big  harvest time of the year. Everyone helped everybody.  Did you all make peanut butter, did you sell?  No, you sold sacks of peanuts by the gunny sacks, we called them. They  call them croker sacks, but they   re gunny sacks. We would just pile  them up, stack them up. And when we would have the truck to take them  to the peanut bins or whatever, that   s what we would do and then father  would receive X amount of dollars. We didn   t get to see that, but most  of the farmers would be able to pay their notes for the whole year. But  he was also a YGS  Youth Guidance Specialist  at Boley. My mother  never worked. She never worked. She did work, she had twelve children.  She cooked for a lot of us so she did a lot of work. (Laughter) That   s  how we made it.  Where would they take the peanuts?  One of the places, I believe, was Okemah. Okemah had a bin. I think  Prague had like a   where you would bring peanuts. They would just  distribute peanuts all over the world. So, a lot of your peanuts that was  probably sold in California or Mississippi came from Boley.  How long did he do that?  Well, we did it until I graduated. I was the last kind of farming son. My  little brother, he didn   t do much, but with me, he was under my wing.  So, probably    78,    79, from 1940s.  Did you raise your family in that area?  No. I met my wife   I say I met my wife at ten years old. I was cutting  yards. I was a hard little worker, but I was cutting yards and this long  pony-tailed girl would be looking at me, and her little brothers and  sisters, around the corner of their house. This was   I was cutting Cousin  Quetta Holloway   s, Ernest Holloway   s auntie   I was cutting her yard. I  would see this little girl, and I never met her because I was still in  another community school. So, when I came to Boley, I saw that girl and  I was like,    That   s the girl I saw around the house.    (Laughs) We had  that kind of connection. Then we had another little incident where I got a  whooping. I   m going to tell that. I got a whooping for kissing her on the  cheek in the sixth grade. Ms. Ivory Owens, I   ll tell you, whooped me on  the table in front of all the kids. (Laughs) But that ended up being my  wife, and we have two beautiful children. I   m the father of four, but we  have two. We go to Boley every Sunday for church so we raise them in  9  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Boley, but not in Boley. We live in Midwest City. They grew up in  Choctaw school district.  Why do you feel this commitment to keep returning to Boley every  Sunday?  Well, our church is the Non-Denominational Full Gospel Church of  Boley. Pastor Jones, Cleophus Jones, and Wanda Jones. We have been  there ever since it was built. I just find joy in serving God. He has kept  me married twenty-seven years, March 8. So, for a young man to say  that it   s a blessing, but it comes from God, because we used to be bad.  (Laughs)  What was your profession, and how did you choose it?  I did not want to do any more construction when I left Boley. I went to  Oklahoma State University. I said,    I will never do construction again,     but my dad raised a lot of children. I think God showed me that this can  be your bread and butter. So, it was like I didn   t want to, but the first job  I got out of Oklahoma State University was in hotel/restaurant at a Sky  Chef. So, I worked there and it was okay, but my brother had a better job  for me the next summer and I did that. I also sold books in Memphis and  Mississippi in 1981. So, I have a variety of career jobs, but they weren   t  really career jobs, they were just jobs. So, I got into the construction  field in 1981, professionally, after going to Rose State for two years and  playing basketball there. So, construction was   I was encouraged to  open my own business and that   s what I did in 1987, yes.  Did you graduate from OSU?  No, that   s an interesting subject. Oklahoma State, my dad passed in  November my freshman year. He dropped me off and said,    This is a big  place, how are you      we   re coming from Boley. He was like,    How are  you going to make it?    I told him,    Dad, I   ll make it. I   ll be fine.    So, I  think he gave me five or ten dollars and I was good. I had a scholarship  to Oklahoma State, academically, and my freshman year, it was okay,  but it was hard because I had to go back to Boley every weekend to take  care of Mom. There was still cattle, horses, everything. She said,    I can   t  do this. I can   t do it.    Then we lost a brother, Lenell Reynolds, on  January 5th, forty-five days later. It gets emotional. It was hard on my  mom, very hard. So, I was not at OSU on weekends, I was always in  Boley. The next year, they asked for my mom   s assets and my dad   s  death certificate, and I went to the president and he was like,    We can   t  afford you if she has this amount of money over here.    I said,    I   m  number eleven out of twelve. We promised to never ask her for any  funds. I just feel like   .    You all know. And that   s why I left Oklahoma  10  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  State in    81.  What was your major?  Hotel/Restaurant Administration.  What is your earliest memory of the Boley area?  I guess going to   the first time going to the rodeo. I didn   t get to go to a  rodeo until I was probably eleven or twelve, because that just was not  for my mother   s kids. Not the kids, now the grown-ups   when I say  grown-up, we   re talking sixteen, we   re talking dating age. It was dating  age at sixteen in our house, men and women. You know, Boley Rodeo  was the biggest thing ever, but you couldn   t get there. You   d just hear  about it. You was out in the country, but you just couldn   t get there.  Phenomenal. You   d hear all these things and finally, when we were able  to go to the rodeo   amazing. How that many people can be in that little  town and then Sunday, Monday, it   s like,    Okay, what happened to that  town?    So, a lot of people used to come there thinking,    Wow, this is a  black, big banging town     No, just for that weekend or homecoming or  something like that. (Laughs)  Do you and your wife still go to the Boley rodeo?  Yes. We   ve never missed unless I   m out of state. Yes, and the children,  they enjoy it.  What is your fondest memory of Boley?  I   d probably say basketball, going down to McCormick   s Caf  . He built  a concrete pad, put up two goals, full-court for boys. Yes, we had  Weleetka, Clearview, Wewoka, Seminole, New Lima, Okemah meet us  there. You want to play some ball, meet us there on Sunday afternoons.  (Laughs)  Do you still play basketball?  I still, little bit, but not much. I mean, I probably stopped playing  basketball about five years ago and got into racquetball and golf. But  yes, that was my fondest   winning the championship, the last  championship that was won was our year in    76. We had some great  players like Nathaniel Quinn, which was captain, Alfred Roseburr,  Forrest Lee, Junior, JC Callahan, Sonny Martin, Floyd Ramsey, Kenneth  Spratt, Elmer LuGrand, myself, Greg Johnson, Anthony Wilcots,  Eugene Jenkins, and Roy Tryon. That was about the team, right there. I  think Charles Coleman   yes, I think Charles Coleman might have been  11  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  on there also.  So that was the all-state winning     That was the last state championship ball that we brought to Boley.  Oh, okay.  Yes, and there   s probably four or five balls there, maybe six. Some  runner-ups and four championships.  How was the basketball team after that?  They went to the championship and played against Hammond and got  really cheated out of that. Duane Williams and Willie Reynolds, Junior  and Fred Holmes, there were several   what was his name? Larry  Spears, Jr. There was a great team then that came up to the state  tournament and just didn   t make it. Yes, politically.  Describe the house you lived in.  The first house we lived in was a small, I   d say, two-room because the  back room was the children   s room and the front room was my mother  and dad   s room. We   re talking the bedrooms, and then you had a living  room and dining room, kind of kitchen. It was just a small home with  two big concrete pillars on the porch. Then we built a house in 1968 and  brought that house, a three-bedroom with running water. At first, we  didn   t have running water. A lot of people in Boley did not have running  water. We drew our water from the well. How we was able to take baths  was in a tub, but that was the most clean   we were so clean. We  starched our jeans and our t-shirts and our Chuck Taylors, and we were  clean with a nice afro. (Laughs) We were clean. My momma, she made  sure we were clean, just clean kids.  Without running water, laundry day would have been     Laundry day was on the back porch with two   with a washer, and we   re  talking about the regurgitater washer. We had a ring that you   d slide the  little ring around and then we would dry through one rinse. Then you  slide it around and put the clothes through there and kind of rinse them  out again and then hang them up on the line. Fresh, the freshest smell,  cleanest you would ever   it   s nothing like that, no static. (Laughs) No  static from the dryer.  With twelve children, she had to do it all day, then, I guess.  12  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Well, not that, we did it on weekends. We did it on weekends, and it was  like staged. Darks, you all put your clothes in the dark area and put your  whites in the white. We knew how to wash clothes.  So all of the children, the boys and the girls?  Well, we took it out to the line. We   d help hang it, but the girls pretty  much washed, until the boys went away. Before I came, there was eight  children, probably. Then there was two or three leaving and then we  were coming. So, she had probably eight or so children there at one  time, versus the whole twelve.  What was your neighborhood like, and who were your neighbors?  Wow. (Laughs) We had a great community with neighbors. On the very  corner of Clayton Chapel was the Dixons. Then about a mile down the  road, not quite a mile, but Mrs. Haynes was on that same block. Then  you had the Hunts and you had the Reynolds. And I   m going to come  down that one street. You had Mr. and Mrs. Golden. They were the  oldest couple in the neighborhood, reached a hundred and something.  They didn   t have any grass on their lawn. There was no lawn. There was  dirt. They swept it clean. If you walked or stepped, they knew someone  had been in their yard. It was clean. (Laughs) Yes, so you couldn   t steal  or   it was clean. So, they had a dirt yard. No grass around anything  except for the pasture. Then you had the Piggies, the Williams, the  Bradfords, a big family, our cousins the Jones. I should say my aunt,  Eula Williams, she had some boys that were Williams also, but they  grew up on up the street. I should say the road because this was dirt road  area. No paving.  What did they do for a living?  Most of them worked out of Tulsa, worked construction. My dad and a  cousin, Red Piggie and Mr. Dixon, they all commuted together to  Drumright, and they were all construction workers. Ted Bradford, they  all were construction workers pretty much, and they farmed in the  evenings and weekends. Of course, they had boys to handle the  equipment, if you had a tractor. If you didn   t have a tractor, you had  mules.  Where were they from, originally?  Most of them came from the Cromwell area where they grew up and  kind of resided in that new community, kind of. You have   it   s a road  called the Georgia Line. You may have heard about that, but that   s  where a lot of people from Georgia got the forty acres in spots, spots,  13  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  spots, when they came for the Land Run. So, a lot of those people were  our cousins, older generations, but some of them I never met. My dad   s  uncles and aunties, they were in that area and then he was down the  street. So, they kind of branched off from the Georgia Line families.  So, your family was from Georgia?  Some of them was from Georgia, also. But like I said, that was not my  dad   s parents. My dad   s parents were from Paris, Texas.  What can you tell us about some of the different clubs and  organizations?  Now, you   re talking partying clubs or you   re talking clubs like FFA   ?  Both.  Okay, we had a VICA, which was a vocational, educational club in  Boley. You had the FHA, which was kind of like homemakers, and then  you had FFA. Another club we had was called a drama club, which was  opened by Lansing Lee. I should say founded, maybe, in Boley by  Lansing Lee. He was a drummer, instructor, and English teacher. So, it  was called the Black Cs. We went to Oklahoma State, Langston and  performed in Lawton, a lot of universities that he was able to get us in  and we performed art, plays, and drama. Beautiful.  Do you remember any of the plays that you did?  Yes, we had some plays where we went to like a rodeo ground and there  was like a little scene or a skit for a couple smooching or whatever. Then  you   d have another person making a poem about a love scene. He was  just creative. He was very creative. We had poems, love poems, kind of  like serious poems. We had a lot of poems, a lot of drama, a little street  stuff. Some street stuff where you had a lady that had a boyfriend and  they kind of like, he was maybe the player type. And soon as she left, he  would get his little book out and make a phone call and get another  lady   I mean, it was just the way the world was. That   s kind of how he  brought his plays.  Did you all get to help create?  Somewhat, but he wrote pretty much everything. We were   the only  input we had was,    Can I do this at this point?    He   d say,       Okay.    So, it  was just little stuff. Our input was very small, though. It had to stay  professional.  14  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  He   s a very good writer, Lansing Lee. Very good.  Right, very good. That   s why I say we enjoyed his class. He was very  creative. We even had debates in his English class at Boley. We never  knew anything about debates until he came to Boley.  How would you describe Boley, today?  Wow. It   s not a ghost town, but it is a town that needs guidance. It is a  town that needs   our churches are probably the largest organizations  there right now. Our churches are. We get together, we don   t bump  heads. They have minister allowance where they have planned all their  whole year without interfering with another church   s program. That   s  awesome. You don   t get that anywhere else, the minister allowance.  How does the city of Boley now compare to when you were in high  school and growing up?  Well, you had kids   you had Friday nights, which school is out. You   d  get your t-shirts, jeans, you dress up, and you   d have a hamburger at  Trulove   s or McCormick   s. Used to be Tomlin   s Grocery Store had  some of the best barbecue bologna there was in the world. (Laughs) So,  that   s kind of what you did. Or you had   Bien Kees had an ice cream  parlor and hamburgers. A lot of people may not talk about him, but he  had the department store that was in the town of Boley. He furnished  every kid with clothes. Brand new jeans, everything, leather, tennis  shoes, he had all the up-to-date suits, everything.  So, the Friday nights was a party kind of night. It wasn   t bad, but we  kind of hung out and made that circle. There   s two circles. You go down  to the end, make a circle, and you drive back up. You make a circle.  Now, everybody has seen you and you can park your car. (Laughter) But  then Saturday nights, you   d have a lot of people coming from different  cities and little towns to come to Boley because it was alive back then.  Even before my time, it was probably a little more lively, but it started  dying out a little bit. But most of your weekends was real busy. Then, of  course, Saturdays, daytime, you had chores and things to do. But  Saturday night, you were able to   as I got older, I was able to drive  myself to Boley and I wasn   t restricted anymore. (Laughs)  Who makes up the Boley community now?  I would say a few workers that work for the state correctional facility.  Just some of my in-laws and people that reside in Boley that doesn   t  have to work anymore, maybe retired. Like the Hicks there, they   ve  been there for a long time so they   ve resided in Boley. That   s kind of the  15  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Boley community. But on Sundays, you   ll see a lot of Boley people  coming from Tulsa, Oklahoma City, to church, and then we go to our  families    homes and eat lunch and go back to Oklahoma City, Tulsa,  Midwest City, Bristow. That   s kind of what Boley is.  What were the important major organizations in your town and how did  they contribute to the community?  Well, one of the major organizations was the school. That brought a lot  of money to the Boley High School. Our gym was always packed. There  was hardly seating room. But Mr. Shavers built our new gym, which I  didn   t get to play in it, but he was building it as I left, which is the gym  that they have now. Seats a lot more people, it   s a lot more comfortable.  Has a two-story balcony, then a one-level area. It has classrooms and  everything so it really was a promising thing when he built that. But  Lee   s Manufacturing was Lee   s Manufacturing before it became  Smokaroma. Smokaroma became Smokaroma through Maurice and  Forrest Lee, after their dad went on. Smokaroma was a big part of  employment. The Boley Correctional Facility for Boys, which is now a  prison, so those organizations were the larger organizations that really  helped out the Boley community. We also had the nursing home that  would house our mothers or fathers, but then they closed. Larry Spears  built a boarding home, which I think helped the community as far as  taxes, maybe. That   s really the only big business there is now.  Is the Larry Spears business?  Yes.  Okay. Do people still use the gym? How is the gym used in Boley, now?  They had a Homecoming that I didn   t get to make. I had drill, because  I   m in the military. I   ve been in the military for seventeen years in the  air national guard. I   m also a technician out there. I   ve been out there for  four years as a human resource specialist/information systems     At where?  At the Will Rogers Air National Guard Base. But the Homecoming was  on my drill weekend. Normally, they really love for me to be there  because I   m a big part of Boley.    Homer   s not going to be here?       No.        Man        But you guys got to keep going.    It was a full packed house.  That   s what I heard. So, that   s what they use it for, for tournaments or     we haven   t used it for a funeral, but I think a funeral would be proper if  they had the proper chairs and stuff set up. But it   s not used as much  because Okemah took over the Boley school system. I should say they  16  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  took over the   or they were granted access to the Boley school and the  kids. Now, some of them went to Paden, but Okemah is who was  awarded Boley.  Who were some of the town leaders, and how did they determine what  kind of community Boley would be?  In my day, Sam Wilcots was the mayor, and he got a lot of stars, or  through his committee. I don   t know exactly if he did it, but through his  committee, the Boley Chamber of Commerce, which Forrest Lee was  very involved, Maurice Lee. They got stars in Boley like Flip Wilson,  Vonetta McGee, Redd Foxx. I can   t think of his name from The Love  Boat     Tim Reid? Ted Lange   Yes. Jackee Harry. We used to bring celebrities in, which would really  bring the crowds to Boley. Their committee, the Chamber of Commerce  Committee or whoever set it up, they were big. Now, we   re still trying to  survive. The NAACP wanted to keep a chapter in Boley. We need fifty  members so we   re trying to get fifty members now, through Homer  Williams. He   s the president of the NAACP.  Do the fifty members have to live in Boley?  No.  How has the age of the leadership changed in Boley over the years?  Yes, it has changed probably quite a bit. The present mayor is JoAnn  Matthews. I say the judge, if there is any judging going on, will be  Henrietta Hicks. They   re a lot older, verses   now, not that they   re not  efficient at doing their jobs, but they   re a lot older. We don   t have a lot  of youth. They don   t have any teachers. You don   t have the school. So,  it   s unfortunate. But as far as the leaders, now, I would say the biggest  leadership down there would be the ministers.  Do the ministers reside in Boley?  Some, yes.  Could you tell me about some people who have connections to Boley, but  have moved away to make their name, and then as opposed to those who  have come back?  Well, like Ernest Holloway. I   ll give you an example. He   s taught in  17  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Boley, before I was even born, probably. So, he taught some of my older  brothers that are gone on. He left Boley and came back to help Boley,  and now he   s deceased, but we have people that are trying to step up to  his   can   t wear his shoes. Don   t even try. That   s one person that left,  was in Boley, and came back. There are some people that send funds to  Boley that support Boley. I wouldn   t know their names, but we have had  great support. Like if we had a meeting and we   re trying to raise money  just to present something or keep something in Boley. Like the school,  when it was there, we were having to raise funds just to pay different  things to keep the funding. Yes, and so we did that. You would see  monies coming from different areas and the next thing you know, they  had fifteen thousand, five thousand, whatever was needed. So, you have  a lot of Boley-ites all over this world that are doing good. So, they  support, I just   I couldn   t tell you any names.  What did people do for a living who lived in Boley as compared to now?  Well, some of them were farmers. There   s not any farmers in Boley that  I know of. There are ranchers in Boley, like the late Skip Richardson, he  just passed, he was a rancher. We organized the Boley Cattlemen  Association, and that   s an organization that we brought back to Boley,  which I   m the treasurer of and Skip was the vice-president and Lenny  Mitchell is the president. So, we organized that to Heifer, the Heifer  program, from Langston-Oklahoma State, has offered a grant with  Heifer  International . If you raise your heifers, if they give you heifers,  you raise them and give back to another community or to another group.  That was a part of Heifer or OFRA, the Oklahoma Farmers and  Ranchers Association. So, those are some of the things that are there  now, but we just don   t have a lot of meetings. But we have organized it.  It is still in function. But there are more ranchers than farmers and more  or less retirees than employees.  Could we come to one of those meetings?  Yes.  We could.  Yes.  Okay. What was the focal point of the town when you were growing up?  The focal point was education. I mean, all of our teachers were   if you  got in trouble, you knew what lick you were going to get. (Laughs) You  knew how many licks, and you might get those licks at home. So, our  parents agreed with that system. We also had devotion, which they took  18  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  that out of schools. That was kind of sad because we looked to have the     Pledge of Allegiance    to the flag, a little prayer, that   s what taught you  how to pray. We don   t have   kids can   t pray in public? They can   t pray  at the table? I mean     I have a question. There was an agreement between the   if you got in  trouble in school and they called your parents, the school knew how  many licks you were going to get when you got home?  Well, you didn   t know how many licks you were going to get at home.  You may not get a whooping when you got home. If they disagreed with  the teachers, you might have a visit from the parent. But if you were in  trouble and it was legit, at our house, you were probably going to get it  when you get home. And a lot of parents    homes. A lot of children   s  homes. You knew you were going to get it at home. If you threw a rock  and you hit someone, yes, you don   t do that at home.  Just a matter of time.  It   s a matter of time. You were going to report it when you get home, so.  Who would do the punishing, your mother or your father?  My father whooped the boys, my mother whooped all. (Laughs) She  didn   t care.  What did she use?  Oh, my god. (Laughs)  You may not want to answer.  Oh, it doesn   t matter. We used to have to get our own switch. If you  didn   t bring one lean enough or green enough, then she   ll go get it. But  my dad whooped with a belt, just on your back side. That was it. He  didn   t move around. He talked to you as you   it   s the worst whooping  you ever could have. One lick, he speaks to you, another lick, he would  tell you,    You   re not going to   ,    another lick. That was my dad. But  when he told you he was going to get you, he was going to get you. My  mother would forget because we had so many kids. We   d say,    She  forgot it.    Next thing you know, she says,    You know, I owe you a  whooping.    That was the shocking thing, you know, to get a whooping  from last week. (Laughs)  Oh, really?  19  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  My mother was a great, strong woman but she meant business. It was  nothing wrong with what she did, even in the bible.  How far in school had they gotten, your parents?  My mother went to college at Langston, I think a year or so. My dad, I  believe he went to the eighth grade. But as far as math and numbers, he  was the man.  Could you walk us through the town, what the town was like? You   ve  done that a little, but could you describe some of the businesses?  Yes. Well, if you came into Boley   well, before you got into Boley, you  would see the Smokaroma corporation on the south side of 62-Highway,  about a fourth of a mile from Main Street. When you got into Boley and  turned to go north, there was McCormick   s Caf  . A little east of him was  Ron   s, The End Zone. We called it    the party.    That was our club. The  End Zone, very classy back in the   very nice. And then go on up the  street a little ways was the boys    home. It ended up being the prison, but  it   s a little bit more east of Boley.  If you turn and go up Main Street, the first building you come to is the  Boley Town Hall on the left. And then on the right was the Boley Hyde  Park Mortuary. That was owned by Skip Richardson. A little bit further  up the street you had Wagon Wheel, which used to be a restaurant. I  don   t remember their names, but they ran that restaurant for a long time.  Very good food and we ate there a lot. Then you have the Gonzalez gas  station on the right, right by the post office, caddy corner to the post  office. On the other side of the street of the post office would be   well,  let me go back. You had the bank that used to be the Boley Bank and it  was closed. Of course, robbed by Pretty Boy Floyd and his gang, and  that never opened back up. Across from the post office is the hardware  store. It used to be owned by Mr. Meyers and now it   s owned by     what   s her name? She has her doctorate degree.  Shelton?  Shelton, yes, Mr. and Mrs. Shelton. You go on up the street, there was  Mrs. Span had a kind of a hat place for women, just hats. Beautiful  place, and you had a Laundromat across from her, which was owned by  the Lees. Then you had, of course, Zet   s Bar or Saloon. Then you had  Jeff   s Pool Hall. Jeff   s Pool Hall was for teenagers. That   s where we  kind of hung out, at Jeff   s Pool Hall. Then across from Jeff   s was Bien  Kees. Kees Department Store, which used to be an ice cream parlor,  hamburgers, and then he moved it to a department store. He has several  rooms upstairs. He used to keep a lot of boys that was kicked out of their  20  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  homes or whatever and kind of gave them a place to stay and go to  school, kept them in school. Especially athletes because they were just  mischievous. But he allowed them to have a room upstairs. Across from  him used to be a Wilson   s Grocery, and then the old Moore Grocery  Store became the Bank   s Grocery Store. This is in my day. So, Bank   s  ended up closing out, but there   s a lot of things.  Then you had Robbie May   s saloon or bar, called the Dew Drop Inn.  (Laughs) A lot of things went on there. Then across the street from her  was the old Hyde Park where Skip   s dad used to have, and mother, used  to have a funeral parlor right in that area. Down the street from her was  the Tomlin   s Grocery Store. These were all buildings that was up and  flourishing and booming. Across from him on the east side of the street,  there was a barber shop and a beauty salon right by each other. Mr.  Alexander, Marvin Alexander, owned that barber shop. I think Mrs.  Wiles had a beauty salon in my day.  Then going on down across from him was Trulove   s Hamburgers. The  best twenty-five cents you could buy. The greasiest hamburgers, but  they were onions and pickles and meat and bread and that   s it.  Mayonnaise or mustard. He had pie. Mrs. Trulove made the pies. There  was sweet potato pie and then you had Mrs. Oliver had like a thrift store.  Mrs. Leitha Oliver. So, you went in and could buy used shoes, used  jackets, used shirts, used everything. So, for people that didn   t have a lot  of money, she was able to help them out. Then across from her, which is  the Climax Lodge 116, which I   m a Mason, I   m a part of that lodge.  Pretty much after that was the phone booth and community. But that   s  Boley, except going to the school and the rodeo ground.  The Masonic Temple, do you have any memories of that?  Yes, it   s still in effect. We   ve redone the building. Like I said, I   m a  Mason at Climax Lodge 116, that   s the group in Boley. Vaughn Wilcots  is now the   he is now our leader, but it used to be Homer Williams and  Mr. LuGrand. So, that has changed. The younger group is kind of taking  over a little bit. But, yes, that was something that you really wanted to be  and you see the guys dressed in their black with white, with white gloves  and honoring their Masonic member that has been deceased. You just  thought that was awesome, the way they carried on in the funeral. So,  now I   m a part of that and we do funerals. We did   well, we were all at  President Holloway   s.  Who has taken over for the mortuary since   ?  Skip   s wife, we call him Skip, but his wife, I guess, has that. We don   t  know who would take over that business. Not right now. It may be a  21  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  little early. But Vaughn Wilcots was his assistant. There is a young man  that I think would like to. I don   t really remember his name, but I think  he   s a Murphy. I don   t know how that   s working out, yet.  Okay. Could you tell us about county fairs and other sporting events?  Yes. We didn   t have football, but we had baseball. We had volleyball.  We made it to the state in volleyball in 1976. (Laughs) Yes. We didn   t  have track like they had later, after I left Boley. But we did have  baseball, and Mr. Gamble was the baseball coach. He was also the Ag  teacher. He taught us welding. Mr. Pruitt was the carpentry teacher that  went to Langston and taught carpentry. But when he left Boley, we  didn   t have a carpentry teacher. Well, they did after Mr.   what   s his  name? I can   t think of his name because I wasn   t there, but I remember  it. I can   t think of his name.  But there were other county fairs, like when we would go to the  community Okfuskee County Fair to present   now, we raised corn, we  raised peanuts. You could bring a bunch of peanuts. A bunch is a group  of peanuts on a stalk. That   s a bunch, one plant. And if they were  judged, you could get first place, second place, third. And me and my  brother, we presented corn from the field. They pulled back the stalk.  So, we got blue ribbons some time at the county fair. This is with  canning, everything kids wanted to do back in the day. I don   t know if  that   s alive anymore or not.  What kinds of things did your mother can? You talked about that earlier.  Yes, she canned. My mother canned everything from greens, green  beans, peas, black-eyed peas, beans. We grew pinto beans on our farm.  Corn, she   d can corn. I mean, everything that you would think. Okra.  She even put a little vinegar in fish, and we had have salmon croquettes  and the bones dissolved. Yes, my mother was sharp. She was sharp in  that area. Peaches, apples, we had apricot trees, we had cherry, we had  walnuts, pecans. We had everything.  How had she learned how to do the canning?  I think from my auntie, Essie Williams, which was the home-ec teacher  from Boley. Yes, she would call her and say,    Get your Sure-Jell for  your jelly and this this and this.    So, I know a little bit about Sure-Jell  and that   s for your jellies and stuff. But we preserved apple butter. I  have some of my mom   s recipes. Cha-Cha, yes, good stuff with your  beans and cornbread.  Chow-Chows, yes. That   s it.  22  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Yes. (Laughs)  Did she have time for home demonstration clubs?  You   re talking about like, I would say like mission programs or  something like that or prayer missions, they had those kind of things.  My mom went to prayer band. There was a prayer band that was  originally founded by Teresia Hubbard. They had prayer band on  Tuesdays and every Tuesday and sometimes Saturdays. Sometimes they  would pray a lot more, but they really was dedicated to the prayer band.  So, when you say mission board or things like that, or women   s club, my  mother wasn   t into that because Boley wasn   t that kind of    But as far  as mission and prayer band or Sunday school, that   s the kind of things  they were in, as far as the women.  What community traditions are celebrated today, and how do the  celebrations compare to the way you celebrated them growing up?  There   s no comparison. We don   t do the community   like I said, Boley  is based around churches now, pretty much, except for Homecoming  communities. Now, they do have the Juneteenth where we come  together as a Boley group, and you have a lot of people coming from out  of town for the Juneteenth celebration. My father had a Juneteenth. He  was one of the original Juneteenth, but we had it at the picnic ground,  which was on an eighty-acre property up the street from our house. We  had picnic tables, you had benches that went from tree to tree, which  shaded your area. You had baseball from Mason, Okemah. They would  bring their baseball groups up and we   d have homemade ice cream,  when the Baby Ruths was real big. (Laughs) And when the chips were  five cents a bag, a nickel for pop. My mother sold these different things  just to make fundraisers for different community events. But we don   t  have that anymore. We do have a fish fry, and we do have a Boley  community   it   s in IXL, but it   s a musical in June, and it   s always  sponsored by the IXL community. They have built a beautiful  community center, which we   re all a part of. But they have that musical  to raise money for that. So, there is a difference versus old and back in  the day and right now.  How are those celebrations still important to the current community?  We look forward to going to Boley and having those community   and  one of the things we do as churches, we have events that we take our  children on in the summer and they look forward to like Frontier City.  So, that   s the difference versus having your little   we don   t have like  the little carnivals. Halloween carnivals, they do still have in Boley  23  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  where you got the big barrel of apples where you dip and get   you  know, those kind of things still go on, I heard. But I haven   t been  involved with that in a long time.  So, does your family still have property there?  Yes, we still have property.  You own that, still?  We still own that. We still have the place out at my mom    s   or I should  say where we were born and raised. We still keep it up.  During the week, no one lives there?  I do have a niece that lives there, now, with her little family and they  will go to Boley. But, yes, it   s being occupied.  Of all of your siblings, did any of them live there after they got through  high school?  My brother, Willie Reynolds, he moved back to Boley and was a part of  the Job Corps program there in Boley. He lived there and raised all of  his children there and grew up and graduated from Boley. My sister,  Suzie, taught at Boley for I don   t know how many years. When Boley  School closed, she had to move to Oklahoma City. She didn   t move  permanently, but she   s teaching in Oklahoma City to finish out her  career. Ella, my sister, Ella, moved back to Boley for a moment and  raised her kids there and then came back to Oklahoma City. Just not  enough employment and not enough income for a family. Maybe I   ll put  it like that. I think Debra, when she graduated, she moved back to Boley  and worked with the Boley Correctional Center for Boys. She   s a  physical education teacher and she worked for GM for years. Now, she   s  in Oklahoma City. But she moved back from Langston to Boley just to  teach a while. Of course, my brother, Lenell, who passed in January of     80, he was one of the police officers and an employee at the  correctional facility.  Could you describe the interactions with other towns like Okemah and  Paden?  Yes. Now, this is   I   m going to be honest because I   m not that kind of  person to sugarcoat anything, but there was times where   and I   m only  fifty. I say,    Only fifty,    but I was old enough to see the prejudice-ness  where we had to go. We didn   t understand it, and we were little. We  drove around the back   this is in Okemah. I   m not trying to put them on  24  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  blast, but I   m just saying, this is what it was. We went around the back  in the alley, and we got a bag with all of our hamburgers. Now, we knew  there were some good hamburgers coming from somewhere, we just  didn   t know where Momma was getting them from.    Momma, why we  can   t go in?    Those were the questions we asked.    We don   t need to go  in. We   re just going to get this to go.    That   s how she put it. When we  got back home then she explained it to us,    We   re not allowed to go into  the restaurant right now.    This is in 1966 or    67, so we went around  back. That was in my era. But now, it   s different. You   re welcome there  and they need your service. I remember when we played Okemah in  1976, I believe, that was the last time Boley played Okemah. They  wouldn   t play us anymore.  Why not?  Well, we beat them pretty good, and so we weren   t welcomed back.  Then, Prague, we couldn   t play them anymore. These were 2A. We were  class A and class B. We weren   t welcomed back. So, we were talking  about community issues, we had to go to Oklahoma City and play John  Marshall, Spencer, Douglass, Millwood, Capitol Hill, because our  locals, Meeker, Prague, Henryetta   I played against Troy Aikman in  what we call the pre-game before you   scrimmage. We couldn   t come  back down to Henryetta in 1978. (Laughs)  Okay, because you had beaten all of those 2A schools that badly?  Yes. Your smaller schools like Mason, Paden, Graham, they played us.  Taft, Tallahassee, Boynton, they played us. But not Prague, Okemah.  We couldn   t get a game with Choctaw, we couldn   t get a game   I mean,  you know. So, we had to go passed those schools and play the   we  played Tulsa-Washington, Booker T. So, we had to play schools like  that. We were getting beat because they were bigger schools. But when  it came down to the tournament time, we were ready for our class. We  done played these bigger schools.  Yes, because Booker T. is big.  Big. I played against     Is it 4A?  Back then it was 4A. It   s probably 6A, now.  It   s 5A or 6A, now.  Choctaw is 6A. Midwest City is 6A. So, those schools that we had to  25  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  play against, it   s because we couldn   t get games in our local area.  I had not heard that. Could you talk about the role of the boys    home  and what became the correctional facility?  Yes. We were taught when we were little that the boys    home was not  for us. Now, when I would see people from Oklahoma City, they  thought we were the boys    home. We played basketball at the gym at the  boys    home. That   s just who   they thought we were bad boys. (Laughs)  No, I   m from Boley High School, not the Boley School for Boys. That  was an all boys    school for bad boys or whoever got in trouble. Different  schools, Spencer, they would say,    Yeah, you all are bad boys from  Boley.       We   re from Boley High School     We had to express that a lot  because we were not the boys    home. Now, there was a couple players  that came from the boys    home that was allowed to play with us, but that  was it.  So, the boys    home was for boys that had little criminal records or  whatever and couldn   t stay or couldn   t be obedient to their moms or  dads. They were sent to the boys    home. There was one also in  Tecumseh, boys    and girls    home. So, at that point, they changed it  because it needed to be a correctional facility. So, the Department of  Human Services switched it to an outgoing, or should I say that was  your last stop. You have a Vo-Tech there, now. So, if you   re getting out  in a year or two, you were able to go get a Vo-Tech, go to the school for  heating and air, go to the Vo-Tech for this, janitorial, and get a job. So,  you   re on your way out. It   s not a maximum security. It may be  maximum security, but it   s not a maximum prison. It   s not like  McAlester.  How do you think that helped the community to have, even though it was  a boys    home, that they were learning a trade? Do you think that that  was important?  Well, my father worked there, my brothers worked there, and they did  everything they could do to help correct these boys. They could not  touch them, they could not hit them or spank them, or anything like that.  But they could help correct them. My dad, as a YGS, Youth Guidance  Specialist, he would bring his boys to watch me play. That was one of  their treats. They would be able to see, kind of, a little atmosphere with  girls, high school, they were all our ages, but he would sit them in a  corner and watch me play. So, my dad watched a lot of my games at the  Boley Training School, we call it.  What traditions or customs from your own family have you preserved  with your family?  26  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  The morals of a Christian background. My mother, she made us sing.  (Laughs) I was four years old when I started singing, publically, and my  older siblings were singing already. So, the last, latter group started  singing, also. So, when they found out the latter group could sing, every  church, we would have to sing.    There is some Reynolds kids here,    and  they would bring us up and we would have to sing. We hated it, but it  grew us up to where we are today. We are still singing. Our group is The  Harmonizers. It   s been The Harmonizers ever since I   ve known my  sisters and brothers, before I was even a Harmonizer. So, now, I   m one  of the lead singers in the harmonizing.  What voice do you sing?  I sing tenor, a little bass because we used to   normally, it was a  cappella, but now my brother, Walter, has a bass guitar and he plays for  us, now.  What church did you attend growing up?  The first church we attended was New Hope Baptist Church. Reverend  Miller Jackson was our pastor for years. He was the one who baptized  me at nine years old, in a pond with mud sticking between your feet.  (Laughs) That was the old way. It put you biblically, versus in the pool  or in the tub in our new churches, now. We went from there to Amos  Temple, which was in Boley because the community church, if it was  not funded enough to keep up, it would go down. That church that we  were   it was in our community, in Clayton Chapel Community, it   s no  longer there. They do have a New Hope Church, now, but it   s closer to  Boley, and it   s still run by Reverend Kidd, I believe.  So, we went to Amos Temple and our minister there was Reverend  Ruffin, and Reverend Ruffin was moved. The Methodist Church, they  would pull a preacher and send him to build up another church and send  this preacher over here that   s already developed. We was going,    Whoa   This is different.    So, we ended up having to build our own church. Not  our own church, but develop a church and get a name and all that. So,  Teresia Hubbard and Cleophus Jones and some of the, like Mr.  Amos   Stevenson, Reverend, Tollie Stevenson   s husband, was grouping  together and we was in a little refuge at one time. Little bitty room, had  church services there until we built funds, and they built the Non-  Denominational Full Gospel Church of Boley, which is probably the  most striving church. Not striving, but we may have the most members,  let   s put it like that.  How many members?  27  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  In our Sunday school, we may have thirty. For Boley, and some of them  don   t have a lot. They may not have that many, but yes, we may have  nineteen or twenty adults and twelve or fifteen children. Our church  service is about fifty or so, sixty. For Boley, it   s pretty packed. I mean,  it   s not packed, but     That   s a good number in a lot of places, not just Boley. Sixty people on a  Sunday morning is a good number. What stories have come to you about  your parents and grandparents that you try to transfer on to your  children?  Well, it   s like we have the religious background, but we also try to teach  them. And my children and my brothers and sisters have the same  background, so we   re all teaching the same thing, which is treating  everybody right and loving each other. And when we get together, it   s a  big get-together. With the Reynolds family, it   s a big get-together. You  could have four siblings and there may be twenty-five people there with  their kids, involved. If there is a reunion, we still have reunions, the  Stallsworth family reunion, the Reynolds family reunion, on Mother   s  and Dad   s side. So, we still have those. That keeps us kind of like  knowing our younger nieces and nephews and introducing them to their  great-aunties and great-uncles that are left.  What are some of your fondest childhood memories?  Fishing, probably. (Laughs) Probably fishing in the rock hole. (Laughs)  That   s a little place that if any of my sisters and brothers heard that, they  would know what the rock hole was. It was rocks all around this hole  that, probably, my brother, Walter, may have discovered. I don   t know.  But he was probably the first one to fish there that I know of. We fished  there. We would catch twenty, sometimes thirty fish. I mean, the rock  hole was just where fish either migrated there and settled, but it was a  rock hole that   boom. Those were fond memories. (Laughs)  Is it still there?  Yes, I can find it. It   s down probably, maybe one block from my mom   s  house, in the creek area. But that was one of the fondest memories. And  probably just the get-togethers at home, the Juneteenth thing with my  father with all the communities coming to that ever year. Playing with  kids from all communities. Those are probably my fondest memories.  Yes, Boley was the place. I went there in high school for Juneteenth.  Who were your childhood heroes and was there anyone local who had a  special impact on you?  28  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Well, you had   locals was just, I   ll just name a few names. My brother  Lenell Reynolds was the captain in 1963, basketball. I always wanted to  be like that. You had Johnny Roseburr, captain and former coach. He  was one of my coaches. Jerry Alexander. We   re talking top athletes at  Boley High School. So, yes, you wanted to be in those, you wanted to be  amongst them. So, by me being a three-time captain and one of the best  recognized athletes from Boley, maybe one of the highest jumpers from  Boley, that   s just something that   I mean, as far as icons from Boley.  But you had your Michael Jordans, you had your Larry Birds, you had  Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar, you had Cassius Clay. Which somebody would  say,    Who is Cassius Clay?    Well, he became Muhammad Ali. Lew  Alcindor became Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar. Those were people we looked  up to   I looked up to.  What kind of entertainment was there, and was it more community-based,  family-based, or did it change as you got older?  Yes, I   ll go back to the Clayton Chapel days. They called them socials.  A social was where you had ice cream, sodas, a dance. It was a social. I  watched my older brothers and sisters go to the socials, and it was just  fun to be at a social. It was no guns, no gangs, no violence at a social.  There may be a fight break out because,    Oh, that   s my girl,       No, it   s  not.    Well    But back then, the socials were   that was the hottest thing.  Then you had prom or you had your senior night or your banquets for  the sports banquet. Those were different, but when I was younger, it was  the socials. But as I got older, it was more or less sports banquets and  proms and dress-up stuff, dress up for things like that.  What did the name Clayton Chapel come from?  I have never researched that. I   ve never researched that, but Clayton  Chapel, Chilesville, Jack   there   s so many names back   Rusk, Sand  Creek. I don   t know. There is a history, but I don   t know where that is.  We know where the name Boley comes from, but then these other names  are coming up like IXL and Sand Creek. Who named them? I just  can   t     Rosenwald, I mean, there   s a lot of little bitty communities that made   I  mean, they were big schools. They were flourishing back in the day. But  then as they would close and people were moving closer to the town of  Boley, Boley used to be pretty big with the hospitals and theaters and  college and different things like that. But that was way before my time.  Football, we didn   t have football in my era.  29  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  What was the role of music, and what were your favorite songs growing  up?  We couldn   t listen to a lot of stuff unless Momma was not at home.  (Laughs) So, but we did love Elvis Presley and James Brown. Now, we  would rock them. And then at the socials, of course, there was not any  gospel played there. But other than that, we were pretty conservative  with music. But we knew, we knew like Diana Ross and BB King. My  daddy, that was probably one of his favorites, you   d hear him,    Just so  sad, Daddy. That   s so sad. They   re just talking sad music.    But it wasn   t  to them because they was talking about the reality of their time.  So, they   d listen to BB King, but you   d go listen to George Clinton at a  social. (Laughter) What were the special food traditions that your family  had, and how do you preserve them?  One of the things, we would be in the fields   and when I say in the  fields, we didn   t have a lot of Bermuda grass on our place at that time.  Our green pastures was green pastures, but it was beautiful. So, we  didn   t have a lot of Bermuda grass. We chopped our peanuts, we  chopped our corn. There was six or seven of us taking two rows at a  time. By the time you come up and down two or three, you   ve knocked  out a portion of the fields. But we would smell the beans, or the peach  cobbler before the beans, or the fried chicken. We knew what was going  on in at Momma   s. I mean we   (Sniffs)      That   s greens.       No it   s not.  That   s beans.    (Laughter) I mean, we could smell it. So, those traditions,  as far as the home cooked meals, the cornbread, beans or potatoes... But  Momma always had a dessert. Always had a dessert. Blueberry pies,  peach cobblers, apple cobblers, German chocolate, pound cakes. I  started cooking at ten so I know all about that.  So, you cooked peach cobbler and fried chicken?  I don   t cook the peach cobbler like Mom, but my pound cake went to a  lot of people at ten years old. My auntie, every time I see a pound of  butter and four eggs, I knew my auntie had sent it. My Aunt Cora, my  father   s, yes. Cora Mobley, my father   s sister, she would always have  me to do her pound cakes.  When was the last time you made one?  Oh, let me see. About three months ago. Yes, I cook a lot. My  background in cooking went from dining room management at Vo-Tech  in Shawnee. Mrs. Claytor was my teacher, she was from Hawaii. She  presented me in a lot of contests. So, I was student of the year. Yes,  student of the year at the vocational, in my senior year, and got a nice  30  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Finchum  Reynolds  plaque, being student of the year at Vo-Tech before I graduated. Then I  went to hotel/restaurant school in Stillwater and in that area, I learned  how to professionally cook, chef, different types of things. But I   m just a  cook, I love to cook. I love to cook. My wife loves me for that.  (Laughter)  Nice. Do you have any special family heirlooms or keepsakes?  Yes.  Could you tell us about them?  I have the belt that my dad whooped me with. I still have it and the  buckle. It   s a Franklin half, not a Kennedy half, it   s a 1958 Franklin half.  It   s a money belt. It has a zipper inside and that   s where he used to keep  hundred dollar bills. But my mother gave it to me and said,    You   re  going to need this for your kids.    I didn   t whoop them with that often,  but I did get my kids every now and then. That   s one thing. And then she  gave me a   I have a buck knife that was my dad   s. I still have it. I have  the   like I say, I have that. Then from my brother, Lenell, he made me a  silver dollar buckle that   s mounted into a buckle and I still have that. So,  there   s a few things that I have from way back.  I know we talked a lot about eating, but could you describe your typical  family dinner? Did you all always get to get together and sit down as a  family?  Yes. When we would eat lunch. Well, first of all, let   s start with  breakfast. Breakfast at Mom   s house was full. We stuffed our own  sausage, we smoked our own sausage, we cured our own hams, we cured  our own bacon, in the smokehouse. We had a smokehouse, and it was  hickory smoked. So, we raised our own meat and like that. But at  breakfast, rice, biscuits. I mean, the full breakfast. We all sat down to eat  because if you didn   t, it was gone. If you didn   t get in your place     (Laughs) Our table seated six, eight, at least eight. Eight to ten. So, our  breakfast was like that. Then when you came from the fields, my mother  would have lunch already going, and we would all sit down and eat at  one time. Then at dinner, or what we would call supper, we would all sit  down and eat at one time. I had the wing. If it was chicken, I had the  wings for years until I got to a leg. There   s ten pieces of chicken and that  was your piece. I love wings today.  Did she make biscuits or more cornbread?  Yes, my mother made homemade biscuits. And she even taught me how  to make the biscuits with powdered milk, flour, baking powder, salt and  31  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  just store it in a jar. You just take out a cup, take out a cup, put your  water, knead it. Yes, I know what I   m talking about. (Laughs) Knead it  out and biscuits was on. I mean, homemade biscuits. But she had her  way for bulk. She was so conservative and creative with cooking for a  big group. So, that   s where I got it from.  So, you still make biscuits at home?  I do, but they   re Hungry Jack. (Laughs)  At least they don   t come out of a can.  They do come out of a can. The Hungry Jack comes out of a can.  (Laughter)  Oh, oops. (Laughter) What world events had the most impact on you  growing up?  Wow. Probably the   and I was real little, but when Martin Luther King  died. But I did get into that, into what happened and why, when I grew  up just a little bit, because that was so hot back in the day. And it was  Abraham Lincoln, what he wanted, to free us and all the things that he  did. So, those were events that when we were growing up in Boley and  you had white towns on both sides, it was like,    Okay, how do we get  past this?    You couldn   t be caught   it wasn   t advised for you to be  caught in Okemah after dark, or Prague or Meeker. Of course, they  weren   t to be in Boley. That wasn   t a rule, maybe, but that was known.  Well, it had been a rule, probably.  It may have been a rule, but I   m just saying, that was    So, those kind of  things impacted me a little bit as far as our freedom, and now we can  breathe and have communication. For with my dad, we   re a mixed  family. His mother is half-white. We grew up not prejudiced because of  that. When he went to the Johnson side, totally different. Totally  different. Light skinned, fair hair or whatever. So, we had to understand  that   what was her name? Aunt Maggie Gray, we all thought she was a  white lady. She was not white. She was half-white, she just looked  white. So, we didn   t have that. But when you got treated like that, it was  different. So, the Martin Luther King, that era was probably the biggest  impact on me as a young man. Now, we have a black president, which is  great and that   s just whatever God ordered. That   s how his plan was.  Obama is in God   s plan or it would have never happened.  What do you see as the impact of integration on the town of Boley?  32  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  I think it was a good thing because we should be able to live everywhere  or anywhere without being afraid. There is whites living in Boley, you  know, they   re our friends. (Laughs) We remember the first white family  that moved that was Boley children, or came to Boley school, was a little  family that was north of Boley. We would pick them up. I was probably  a junior or a sophomore or junior in high school, so I kind of hovered  them little kids on the bus. They would all three or four sit in my seat  because I was always treating them, welcomed them. So, I don   t know  their names, but if they ever see this or hear this, they would probably  say,    That   s Homer Reynolds, that   s the one       You know, I used to sit  them, I   d sit them, all three, on my seat. But you know, we weren   t  raised like that. But integration in Boley is a good thing. It   s still a black  town and ran by blacks, but it   s okay. The Mennonites have been there  for years, since I was a child.  In your schooling, how did you learn about black history and Boley  history? Was it part of the curriculum?  Yes. Black history was taught by our band teacher. Then, of course, Carl  Owens took over the history program there. Boley history was   we  would like have moments that our teachers would just sit down and talk  about it. It wasn   t in a book. We never seen the books until later or  magazines or clippings. But yes, they would just sit down and talk about  Boley and how it used to be. The train track used to come through, the  cotton gins. I was like,    What? Cotton gins?    We had three big cotton  gins. I didn   t talk about cotton, but we used to pick cotton. I made my  first   I think my first cotton picking was twenty-seven cents that day.  (Laughs) That wasn   t much money, but a quarter could buy you and  your brother all kinds of candy. All kinds of everything. Twenty-seven  cents. Then the next day I worked a little harder. But I was probably  seven or eight years old pulling a gunny sack.  What is it about Boley that keeps people going back and keeps that  connection so alive?  I think the heritage of proud Boley-ites, as Holloway would call it, Dear  Boley. It wasn   t a bad place, it was a great place. The education was  good. I was able to compete with anyone in college, and I came from  Boley. They were like,    You came from the Training School for Boys?        No, I came from the Boley High School and graduated with honors,  there.    So, I was one of the salutatorians, had the highest average my  senior year, out of the whole school. I did. But I knew Anthony Wilcots  was a little smarter than me, and I switched that. Mrs. Kyra Holloway,  she   s the one that told me,    You know you   re the top on the honor roll?        Okay.    She said,    You know you   re the valedictorian.    I said,    No, I   m  not the valedictorian. Brother is the valedictorian.    She said,    Well,  33  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  Simpson  Reynolds  you   ll have to give it up.    Yes, and that   s a true story. But it ended up  being four salutatorians and one valedictorian   or three salutatorians,  yes.  What do you think is the most important thing that people need to know  about Boley?  I would say that if you   re an outsider and you know about Boley,  support Boley if you can. If you   re a Boley-ite and you hear about Boley  needing something, support. If it   s on a grant and we need numbers on  the computer, register. Things like that. It only takes   the world is  economically different right now, but it   s not electronically. So, the  electronic world can stretch out to more than   there was no cell phones  back in my day. There wasn   t even beepers. (Laughter) So, now that we  have the communication level that we are now, I   d say that you could  stretch out and send a message through the internet that,    I am a Boley-ite.  Yes, I support.     Oh, like with the Small Town thing?  Exactly, yes.  I voted that I was a Boley-ite.  Right. And if the Coke situation, where we could have got grants or  could have been granted, but there was so many other communities that  put more votes in than we did. So, that would be one thing that I would  say that if you are a Boley-ite, stretch out and listen. If you hear  something, don   t hesitate to vote or say hi or whatever. I don   t have  Facebook, but I know that it   s out there, the communication.  How would you like to be remembered?  I   m remembered in a lot of ways. (Laughs) It   s not always the best thing.  I say,    The old man has died,    because when I got saved, that   s how I  look at it. I   m not   I was a protector back in the day. I didn   t like  violence, but I would stop you from   if you were a bully, I didn   t like  bullies. I never jumped on anyone, but I didn   t like bullies to jump on  anyone, either. So, a lot of guys know me as being a player, maybe, back  in the day. A lot of ladies. I mean, I grew up loving girls, average boy  from Boley, big afro. (Laughs) And everywhere you went, you met girls.  And if you were nice, you were going to be attracting girls and that   s  what it was. It   s just something my brothers have a trend of,    Those are  Reynolds boys,    you know. (Laughs) So, yes, but being remembered,  one of the most sensitive people. I will be remembered as a caring,  loving father and husband, protecting of the family, and giving. I   ll give  34  Simpson  Reynolds  you anything. Yes.  Okay, well, thank you very much. We really appreciate the time you   ve  given to the oral history project.  Thank you.  -------  -------
