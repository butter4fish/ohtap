 Little Thunder  Redbird  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is January 20,  2011  and  I   m interviewing Robert Redbird for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project, which is sponsored by the  Oklahoma  Oral History Research  Program at OSU. We   re in a conference room at the Anadarko Public  Library. Robert, you   ve been active on the Oklahoma art scene for many  years with many honors and awards, and I appreciate you taking the  time to talk with me. Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I partly grew up as a child in Gotebo, Oklahoma, which is out in the  western part of Oklahoma. I grew up with my grandfather. My  grandfather and my grandmother raised me and brought me into this  world. Naturally I had a mother,  but  what I   m saying is, my  grandfather took over because I had epilepsy. I had seizures and my dad  did not like that. I had a very bad dad. He didn   t appreciate me. He  didn   t like me. He was ashamed of me, embarrassed of me. Back in  them days, if you had a son like that, people were ashamed of you. I was  just one of those boys that had a hard life growing up. But it was my  grandma, my dad   s mother, who took me as a child and began to raise  me until I was like sixteen years old. They raised me in the home at  Gotebo. And I tell you what, it was a very amazing thing that I had gone  through as a young boy growing up at Gotebo. Farm lifestyle. My  grandfather was a fantastic farmer. My dad   s mother was a white lady.  She was Caucasian. She was white and my grandfather was a Kiowa  Indian, but my grandmother   my dad   s mother was white and German.  I guess German and white   whatever   Caucasian. She lived right  across the street from my grandfather when he was a young man.  Back in those days, 165 acres was allotted to those who wanted to  homestead. And my grandfather got 165 acres and got a home. A four  square, four-room home. Porch on each side. And Grandma lived right  straight across the road where my great-grandpa lived, Herman  5  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Zacharias. They were German and white. And time went by, and my  great-grandfather came over to my grandfather and asked him,    What  are you going to do with all that land, Johnny?    He said,    I don   t know  what to do with it.    He said,    Why don   t you let me farm it?    Well,  Grandpa didn   t know there was a beautiful woman over there.  (Laughter) That was my grandma. So, Grandma helped Grandfather. She  helped Grandfather get involved in the farming life and he became a  fantastic farmer. And I grew up on that farm as a little boy. I had  seizures all the time. I almost died several times when I was a kid  because of my seizures.  They didn   t know much about  epilepsy then .  They didn   t know much on how to  handle  it, but Grandma always took  care of me and I came through all that. I grew up. I became a teenager.  When I was eight years old, my grandfather was a very famous man.  Monroe Tsatoke was his name.  Oh, so you had an artistic influence already?  Oh yeah. Then I had Vernon Lee Tonigah, my uncle. And then I had Lee  Tsatoke. And then I had another uncle, George Geionety. All of these  guys were very influential artists. My grandpa Monroe Tsatoke was one  of the members of the five famous Kiowa Indian Artists back in those  days. And it was interesting to me as a kid. I was eight years old.  Did you draw?  Oh, yeah. When I was eight years old, I told my grandfather, Monroe  Tsatoke, I told him,    Grandpa, I want to be famous just like you. I want  to be an artist like you.    He said,    Well here.    He gave me a pencil and a  paper and he said,    Get started.    Eight years old, I started dabbin     around and watching him, looking this way and looking that way. And  you know what? I began to pick it up. When I was sixteen years old, I  sold my first piece of artwork to a doctor in Carnegie, Oklahoma. I sold  it for ten dollars and I took that ten dollars and I gave it to my grandma,  and I said,    Go buy some groceries, Grandma.     These things I did back in those days were fun times. I used to ride  behind our wagon. Grandpa had a wagon, a buggy carriage that we went  to church every Sunday on. That   s kind of the lifestyle I had   a farm  life. It was a good life and I never lived with my mom and dad until  later, when I became old enough to take care of myself and be around  my own family. But I was already flourishing as an artist. When I was  sixteen years old, I began to flourish. I began to be recognized for my  artwork.  6  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Were you using watercolors?  I always just used watercolors. Grandpa bought me one of them cheap     that little bitty deal. That   s how I got started. It was just flat, those little  circles. You get your water, you rub it on there. That   s sort of how I did.  But I have to say that God had me in his eyes and in the palm of his  hand, because even though I had a hard time growing up with epilepsy,  seemed like the road of life was already laid out for me as an artist.  Because I went to school after school, college after college to learn how  to take care of myself, and if I get married, my wife. I went to college. I  went to school.  Where are some of the places you went to school?  Well, I went to the Santa Fe Art Institute in Santa Fe to help further my  education. I also, at one time, briefly, was the art director at Santa Fe.  But I couldn   t stay behind a desk. I decided I didn   t want that kind of  life, so I resigned and gave them a notice and I left. It was back in the  late    60s.  I did a lot of other things. I went to Okmulgee Tech, where I learned  skills that I wanted to exercise in my life such as welding. I can do  beautiful metal sculptures, I just don   t do them because of my belief. I   m  an ordained minister and I do not create any images. The Bible, God   s  word says,    Thou shall not create any images or any graven images, or  any statues or that sort of thing.    So even though I was leaning in that  direction, I never went that way because first of all, I am an ordained  minister. I am a preacher and I don   t go that way. I try to do things in a  manner in which He wants me to do. And I have so much to be thankful  for, and as the thing goes on. My life, I find out that it   s a wonderful life  and there   s a lot of opportunities.  My artwork has taken me all around the world. I   ve had so many  miraculous things happen in my life. I even met Prince Charles in Palm  Springs when the late Sonny Bono was the mayor. I designed that year   s  poster for the US International Open Polo Game tournament, which was  back in 1967. That poster went all over. I sold it right there and I did real  good. That night at the reception where VIPs go, I was their celebrity  guest artist for that big event. I got to shake the man   s hand. I was so  happy because I was moving. I was moving in the circle of life that was  so impressive. Seemed like I was just moving up. I won over all the  artists in America back in 1989 or    90. Back in those days, I had won  and whipped every artist in the country. I beat them. I got the best in the  show, and I just kept winning. But I   m kind of jumping the gun here.  7  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  When I left Mountain View or Gotebo, I went to school at Fort Sill  Indian School. That   s where my mom and dad put me. There was a lady  there, Mr. John Tay Moore was her husband   s name. Well, Mrs. Moore  had an Indian Art Club that she formed on the campus at Fort Sill Indian  School way back when I was just a teenager. All the artists that became  so famous after that were a part of that group.  Who were some of your classmates?  Some of those classmates were Doc Tate Nevaquaya. Doc was one of  them, and Oscar Howe was another one. There were so many of them.  Raymond Hicks was another one, and then myself. David Williams.  There were artists who became so famous, and I always wondered about  that when I was growing up. What was I going to do and all that? I don   t  worry about it no more, but back in those days I did because of my  seizures. My seizures hindered me a lot. I never had nothing to look  forward to, even though I painted and all that stuff, it wasn   t my main  stream in life.  My main stream in life was to raise a family. I wanted to be like  everybody else, but I couldn   t because nobody wanted me. I mean, the  ladies didn   t have anything to do with me, the women, because I had  seizures. I never had an opportunity like that and then one day, a miracle  happened. I met my wife. She took me as I was and she helped me and  nurtured me and encouraged me and stood by me to this day. We  celebrated our fifty-first anniversary. We   ve been together all my life.  She took a chance and she loved me and she took care of me and she  schooled me and helped me in my life. I   m still with her today. And  today, I   m still painting. What I   m trying to do right now is get ready for  the future. I still have a bright future. Everything is just coming up roses  for me. I have a magnificent story to tell. A brand new story, dealing in  oils. Nobody has ever seen my oil paintings.  So you   re doing oils?  I   m going to start a new adventure and this adventure is going to take  everybody with me down the road of a beautiful life in oils.  I want to pick that up again. First, I   d like to ask you when you first  started painting with the Indian Club there at Fort Sill, what was your  early style like?  Flat. Line work. That   s flat work. And I was good at it. Everybody was.  Doc Tate remained that way all his life. And he was awesome. The  flatwork   I want to say this, that the two-dimensional flatwork styles  back in those days existed, and it was good. But what do you do as time  8  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  goes by and all these things begin to become stagnant? You have to start  thinking,    What am I going to do in order to bring this artwork and keep  the Native American Indian art alive?     Was your subject matter, back then, also more historical, specifically  Kiowa?  I think my grandpa had a lot to say about that, my grandfather. Because  my grandfather was quite a historian. He said,    If you can do anything in  preserving our painting, our people, don   t you mess around. You do it  right.    So, he taught me everything that he knew about our culture,  history, stories, legends and all the things that I paint today. And then I  had another man, I give him a lot of credit. His name is William  Tenedah.  He is my wife   s grandfather , and it was through his eyes and  his life that I even learned more because he was a holy man, a medicine  man. And the stories that I got from him. He says,    Son, I   m not going  to leave you no material stuff. I   m not going to leave you no lands, cars  or houses or whatever but what I leave you is knowledge. And what I  give you is going to take care of you and the reason why I   m giving it to  you is so you can take care of my granddaughter, Joquita.    That   s my  wife, Shirley   s sister.  So I honored that and I honored that old man until the day he died. I  loved him. I took care of him. He used to live with us. I took care of that  old man, Mr. Tenedah. There are so many men in my life that I have to  say,    Hey, hold on now, these guys were the ones who stepped in my  life when I needed it.    I didn   t do this by myself. I had help along the  way. It was these gentlemen that came into my life, that helped groom  me and bring me forth in this art world business, that loved me. I used to  have a dad. My dad, his name was Bob McCabe. He was my dad, my  adopted dad.  Yes, and was he the first art dealer that you cultivated a relationship  with  too ?  Yeah, it was a funny story there. They had, in Oklahoma City during  that year   I forget what time, it was the early years   I was only twenty  years old. But there was a man sitting there at the Azalea Arts Festival in  the park down in Oklahoma City. And I walked by there, I and my wife.  I had paintings in my car. I wanted to go with the idea that I was going  to sell my paintings to somebody there because there was a lot of  vendors. My dad and Doris were sitting over there and I seen all those  paintings that he had.    Oh, that   s my man     I said. (Laughter) So, I went  over there and I asked him,    Do you all buy Indian artwork?    and he  said,    Yes, we buy Indian artwork.    He said,    Who are you?    I told him,     My name is Robert Redbird and I   m an artist.    He said,    Well Mr.  9  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Redbird, let me see what you got.     I ran all the way back to my car (Laughter), which was several blocks  away, and I got my paintings. I ran all the way back to that festival, and I  said,    Whew, here they are.    And he started looking at them and looking  at them. He said,    Say, these are just as good as what I got here. You  selling these?    I said,    Yes, sir.       What do you want for all of them?    I  said,    I don   t know. Whatever you feel like you want to give me for  them. If you want to buy them, I   ll sell them to you.    So he gave me  three hundred dollars.  Now, when you   re a young, twenty-year-old kid back in them days,  three hundred dollars was a lot of money. That was just a power boost in  my life.    Oh, I got to go home and paint.    He said,    You go home and  you paint me some more and you bring me some more artwork and don   t  stop until I tell you to.    As the years went by, I never heard him say,     Don   t bring me no more paintings.    He said,    Bring me more. Bring  me more.    And you know what? My dad, Bob, I loved him just like my  own. I loved him just like my own dad. He schooled me. He scolded me.  He stood me up and said,    Hey  Wake up  This is what you   ve got to  do.     And a lot of times my dad would get on to me. He   s the one that shaped  my life for the future. God blessed me with this man when this other  man, who was my dad, wouldn   t do nothing for me, this man did. And  you know what? That   s the thing I can honestly say that really helped  me in my life is to be loved by somebody. I   m not talking about make-believe.  I   m talking about real love. That would do what he done for me  and my family. He   s been there for all thirteen of my children. He   s been  there when they were all born. Every one. And they call him Uncle, but  really, he   s Grandpa, but these things that Bob has done in my life took  me all over the world.  Did you travel together?  I and Dad did everything. We went everywhere. We went all the way to  Germany. Dad was the kind of guy that really meant business. He didn   t  mess around. We went to almost every show there was in America. Dad  had a way of doing things and he didn   t mess around, like I said.  A lot of the shows in the West?  Oh yeah, we did one of the most popular ones there, the Peppertree. In  California. Desert place. But the best show that Dad ever did with me  was in Denver, Colorado. He held that big old painting and was dancing  all the way to the bank. (Laughter) It was the Colorado Indian Market.  10  Little Thunder  Redbird  Did you win an award on that one?  Oh yeah, I won the best in the show. I beat everybody in Alaska,  Canada, United States and Mexico that had artwork in that show. I won  the best of show and I got   what is that? The Grand Award? Big old  ribbon about that big. (Laughter) I can remember the guy   s eyes. It was  called The Glory of a Nation. I wanted to do something that was  powerful. So I did a painting that would stand for something of this  nation of ours. We have a beautiful nation and a beautiful country, and  this is a powerful country because of men who fought for us over there  and over there and over there. My own uncle died in Germany, he died  when he was bombed. My mother   s brother. My uncle Mac gave his life  to help us to keep people away from us like Hitler and all them people.  But it was a rough time for everybody back in those days in the    40s,  back in 1945 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. It was a rough time back  then, too. But I always try to do things and I always try with my talent,  not be selfish and keep it to myself. I never was that way.  All my life I   ve been a giver. Here and there, here and there because it   s  not mine to keep. So I give it whenever the cause is needed for me to  step in   well, look at this one. (Shows painting) Recently, years back,  the Twin Towers was bombed. Exploded and they came down. As a  preacher, I looked at that and I said,    This is not right. We have to do  something. We have to. We are a great nation.    Well, our president  stepped in and he said,    We   re going to declare war on these people and  this nation.    The prophet Samuel says   I   m throwing this in here  because it needs to be in here   the prophet Samuel told King Saul, he  said,    Hey, what are you doing with this man, your enemy? You fought  the battle and you won. What are you doing with the king down here?     The king was on his knees begging for mercy from King Saul. But the  prophet, Daniel, told him, he said,    The Lord says to spare nothing.     And what he meant by that, he says,    When you declare war on  somebody, you go and do it.    And he pulled the sword out of the waist  of King Saul and he slewed the enemy king, and he said,    Spare  nothing.     Today, we are trying to be   we let that nation get away with what they  did to our Twin Towers. To me, I don   t like that. I   m speaking openly  about that. You might cut it out, you may not want to hear it, but that   s  just from the artist   s standpoint. I feel like we should have done  something to that country that did that to our innocent people here at the  Twin Towers. A lot of innocent people died. For what? Because of their  way of believing? And I just feel like I   m really a part of that because I  painted two pictures and gave them to the City of New York at the  request, of   at that time, Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York City.  11  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  He came to me, I didn   t go to them. He came to me through a guy who  was my friend who was the superintendent of these schools down here,  Tom Cantrell. Tom came to my house one day and he says,    Robert,  I   ve got a job for you. A good friend of mine who is the mayor of New  York City wants to know if you can help. Do a special painting that will  glorify the nation and show that we are a powerful nation, and that we   re  not going to stand for this.    I said,    Well, what does he want?    He said,     This is what Mayor Rudy Giuliani wants.    He said,    I want a warrior.  An Indian warrior with a war bonnet holding a warrior   s lance and  directly behind him, I want this bald eagle and behind the bald eagle, I  want the Twin Towers in the clouds.    The Twin Towers in the clouds,  the bald eagle in the clouds and the man himself in the clouds, because  this is spiritual. This is our nation coming together and it   s a powerful  thing. So I said,    Wow, what a painting that would make      So I designed it. I painted it. We went to New York City, took it up there  when I got it done, and gave it to them. The Firefighters    Commissioner  out of New York City saw the painting.    Well, I   ve got to have one of  them for our firefighters. Would you do me one?    I said,    Sure, I   d be  happy to.    They didn   t know what it would have taken to put that all  together and put it down to where it would be awesome. But I did it for  him, also. But the only thing that I kind of frowned on was that the  Firefighters    Commissioner wanted this picture   his portrait down here  at one corner and then the emblem on that firefighter emblem on this  other side. So, it was kind of difficult.  You did that as part of the gift?  Yeah, it was a gift, too. So I helped the City of New York raise, I think  about  5,000 or  4,500 dollars off of that painting.  The prints were sold as a fundraiser?  Yeah. Everything was sold in Europe. Nothing was sold here and I  appreciate those people from Europe doing that for our nation.  When you start out as an artist, you   re more interested in the creative  part, and the business side is sometimes tricky. Did you get business tips  from other Indian artists periodically?  No. I got it from my dad, Bob McCabe. I got everything from Bob. Bob  was a man that went out and took those paintings from other artists, Doc  Tate   s and everybody else   s, including mine. And he would go with  another guy, his name was Henry Balink. He was a Swedish guy, lived  in Santa Fe. Had Balink Studios.  12  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  I recognize that name.  Henry was my first contact out west. Dad went to see him and presented  my work to him, and he wanted more artwork from me because he was  selling them like crazy. Dad   I loved him so much I made him a part of  my life that he would share in everything that I did. I gave him my work.  I didn   t sell him artwork. I gave him artwork. All my life, I have painted  magnificent paintings because I loved my dad so much. I said,    Dad,  take these. Sell them. You could use the money. I want to help you. You  helped me all these years become a famous artist. Now I want to help  you back.    And he was an old man, my dad. But I loved him so much  that I would just do anything for Bob McCabe. That   s the way I feel  about it.  I remember when airbrush became the popular medium for artists. You  could cover big areas with color, get kind of mist-like effects and  mystical  ones . Do you want to talk about your work with airbrush a  bit?  Sure. I want to take credit for that. (Laughter) The reason why I want to  take credit for it is because it was   you   ve got to look back at those  times when Indian artwork was beginning to grow stagnant. That flat,  two-dimensional style was fading. There came a period of time when  everything quieted down. You couldn   t hardly sell a flat, two-dimensional  Indian-style work back then. And it was very difficult to go  out and sell and make a living because times were moving on. That time  has passed. So, we got to do something else. What do we do? I took the  airbrush, okay? Nobody was using the airbrush. No one. The only one  that introduced me to the airbrush was my son, who was a very good  artist in his own right, Gary White Deer. Gary White Deer introduced  me. He said,    Dad,    he said,    I got something I want to show you.  Maybe you can use it.    Well, I already learned how to regulate air with a  brush because I used to be an auto body repair man back in Dallas,  Texas. I used to repair automobiles and I used to spray paint them.  What   s the difference between an airbrush? It works the same principle.  I said,    Well, I can do that.    At that time, all across this land, all across  the nation, you didn   t see Native American Indian artists using an  airbrush. So I said,    This is what I   m going to do like Grandpa told me  to do.    My grandpa said,    Do the right thing. Don   t mistreat it or abuse  it.    So, I took the airbrush and I was telling my wife one day, I said,     You know what I   m going to do? I   m going to use this airbrush so that  I can bring an object out of nowhere.    Boom and there it is. This is the  reason why I started using the airbrush, so I can emphasize more the  ceremonial spirituality of the thing. To show that, hey, this thing came  out from nowhere. Boom, there it is. It   s here.  13  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  So, the paintings that I do today   I used the airbrush to emphasize that. I  can   t deny it, I   m a preacher. So I want to show the spiritualism of  everything that I do. When I use these hands, I want to make sure that  they are telling the right story. And the only way I can do that is by  using the airbrush. The airbrush   I can paint an object coming into view  with the airbrush. That   s spiritual. Most of our artists throughout this  United States are highly spiritual people. Look at Merlin  Little  Thunder . Look at what he does. He   s one of the most awesome artists  that I know. Merlin Little Thunder. I   m not just saying it because you   re  sitting there. I   m saying it because I know in my heart what this man has  come to, and that   s the reason why I got to say, there are a lot of great  artists like Merlin that are out there. I never said I was the best, but I  think that I   m probably one of the most famous ones around, that   s all I  know. Look, I   m a National Hall of Famer   four times. National Halls  of Fame. And I honor that in my life. I   m the first Native American ever  inducted into the Motion Picture Hall of Fame.  How did you get into that?  Well, I used to live in Scottsdale, Arizona. I had contacts with actors in  the entertainment field and I come across a guy named Kevin Costner,  okay? He acted in Dances with Wolves. Now, there   s a lot of other  things there. There   s a lot of actors like John Wayne    he was a good  friend of mine. John Wayne, Slim Pickens, and Warren Oates   all these  guys were in the movies. Now, what I tried to do as an authority on  Indian life and culture was to tell them how to speak.  So you were a cultural consultant?  Yeah, that   s what it was. And here   s the thing. A lot of our Hollywood  Indians were white people. But when it came to real Indian people, I  wanted to put emphasis on that language barrier that they had. They  couldn   t speak real proper English, so there was a place in there that  stands out. If you ever watch the movie Dances With Wolves, look at this  guy when he says,    We come far, you and me.    Today, we would say,     Look how many years we   ve been married. We   ve been married for  fifty years.    But back in those days if you   ve been with somebody,   you   d say ,    We   ve come far, you and me.    That means, we   ve been  together a long time. So there   s a lot of other things I can talk about that  are real in the life of Indians, the history part of it. I always wondered  and I dreamed about visions that was told to me. And I used to say,    Boy  I wish I could do that.    Now I can.  I used to sit there  by  my grandfather and listen to the stories that he  told me about this owl. He tells me about animal stories, about the  14  Little Thunder  warrior and the wolf. These are the things I record in my paintings. I  paint real stuff. I don   t just put a wolf in there just to put a wolf in there.  I tell it like it is. I   m a historian artist. I got the historian artist award at  the Hollywood Indian Stars Awards in Beverly Hills when I was  inducted into the Motion Picture Hall of Fame that night. And I got the  Lifetime Achievement Award, the Humanitarian Award, Artist of the  Year Award, Historian Artist of the Year Award because why? I got  those awards from the state of California because I didn   t do it to get  recognition, I did it to help those handicapped kids.  For eight years I supported their summer program, the same way I did in  Scottsdale. For eight years, I supported these kids that Bob Tungland  had. I did a lot of fundraising so these kids could have a summer camp.  They were handicapped kids, crippled and all this. I asked him,    What  are you doing for these kids besides mostly dances once a month?    He  said,    Nothing, I can   t do anything.    I said,    Why don   t you take them  on field trips?    He said,    We don   t have the money.    That   s when I  started thinking,    Okay, if you ain   t got no money, let me help you.    He  said,    Why?    I said,    I   m an artist. I   m a very famous artist. You buy  my paintings.    I said,    These same paintings that you   re buying, I   ll  produce fifteen to twenty of them and we   ll have a show at the Borgada  in Scottsdale. All the money that I get from there I   ll give it to you for  these kids so they can have a summer program. They can go on tours,  trips or whatever.    He said,    You   ll do that?    and I said,    Sure, I   ll do  it.    And that   s how we got started. I think the first year we did  45,000.  That was a great start for that first year. The most I ever made for those  kids was  56,000 and you know what? People were so generous. I had  celebrities. I had Waylon Jennings. I   ve had Tanya Tucker. I   ve had  people in the entertainment business come down and help me. Governor  Fife Symington. I   ve had Governor Rose Mofford from Arizona   both  Arizona governors. I   ve had people of the staff for the corporation to  come and help me. That   s how we did it back in those days.  Now I   m kind of getting up in age. Now I   m kind of slowing down, but  everything   s coming up roses for me. Like I said, I had a heart attack  and zip, zip and here. But you know what? God is so good that he spared  me and brought me back. Now, everything   people are so happy. The  people who thought I was done for are so delighted that I   m back. And  they see good things coming here and they   re all behind me. Everybody  loves it. So, I just want to pass that on to you, to the people out there.  Hey, have hope. And have hope in what you put forth in your beliefs.  Believe that it will be done and it shall be done.  When you were in your twenties, there was this Kiowa cultural revival,  the Palmer brothers were putting together the veteran   s society that  eventually became the Black Leggings ceremonials. I wondered if you  15  Redbird  could talk about the influence of Native American church on your  artwork?  Sure. Let me enlighten you about these things because they   re real. It   s  all spiritual. A lot of people don   t look at it that way, but I do. And the  thing that I want to tell you is that the peyote ceremonials that are being  held to this very day are highly spiritual and do work. What God gave  our people back in that time   I   m going to tell you a story of how that  came about for the Kiowas. Back in the early 1700s, the Kiowa tribe  wasn   t in Oklahoma. They were from Montana. Back in those days, the  Kiowa, they had runners. And these runners would go here and there and  they would report back to the chief. These runners ran great distances.  One runner came south and he found this land we call Oklahoma from  Colorado. And he told the chief,    I have found this beautiful place. It   s  not cold. Our people won   t die in the winter time. There   s plenty of  food. Plenty of game. Plenty of everything. This is where we should go.     So they had a meeting, the chief and the sub-chief. They had a meeting.  The sub-chief said,    No, this is our land. This is our country. We   re  going to stay here.    But the chief said,    Yes, our people are dying  because they   re freezing to death. They   re dying. We need to go  somewhere else.    So the chief brought the Kiowas that wanted to come  with him. And they separated us   the tribe split. So, the Kiowas came  south. There was this one woman with an old man, her dad, who was in  that movement as they came southward. That old man started getting  sick. They got somewhere by Colorado Springs, Denver, in that area, as  they were journeying south. He said,    I don   t think I can go on any  longer, daughter.    She said,    But I will take you as far as I can, Dad.     She brought this man with  her  all the way. They wound up down here  by Midland, Texas, south.  Now, as the story goes, our legend tells us that this lady was dying. She  was left alone by the people. She  had  dropped back to take care of her  dad. As she was laying there dying, she heard a voice. She looked up  with dim eyes and she saw a white buffalo. It was spiritual and it began  to speak to her and it told her,    Why are you dying when there was so  much abundant life around you? Why are you laying there dying?    Well,  she didn   t know.    There   s nothing to eat here,     she said . He said,    Get  up. Follow me. I   ll show you.    And he took her and there was an herb  down there.    Get that.    He told her what to do and he cleaned it off and  he said,    Eat it. You eat that and eat as much as you can until you can   t  eat no more. You will have new strength and new life.     That herb that he gave her is being misused to this day by people who  don   t know what they   re doing and they   re disrespecting our ways by  doing it. It   s called peyote. The peyote button. They think that they can  16  get high on it, but it   s not made for that use. It   s made as a medicine for  our Indian people. When Grandpa was telling me about the story about  the many ways that you can prepare that herb  for  the condition of the  sick person   all these things I learned. I observed, I learned. I watched  him do it. So, this lady got up and she ate that herb and along with that,  while she was doing all that, this spiritual white buffalo, the God that we  serve today was, through this white buffalo, giving her songs. Peyote  songs, ceremonial songs. He said,    Take this medicine and give it to  your people.    And to this day, it   s still here. So, that   s what I wanted to  tell you about that.  So, from that time forth, it was a woman who held these meetings. That  lady. But when she died and got too old, she turned it over to her  brother. And the men began to use that and the men began to run the  meetings. There was no women, but even though a man was sitting in  there   all these men sitting in there, no women   when they beat that  drum and they   re singing,    boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,    you can  hear a woman singing with the man. There   s no woman in there, but you  can still hear that woman singing when they beat that drum. They   re  singing these sacred ceremonial songs. They   re for healing, and  everything is going so good. You see things, good things, not bad things.  Good things.  Sometimes Grandpa told me that he could see the things of the dark  forces that inhabited the sick person, leave that thing. They leave. He  said,    Sometimes I can actually see that.    I didn   t believe him, but I do  now. Let me tell you why I believe it. God gave these people something  and we   re using it. Now, Grandpa Cornbread had a medicine bag and he  called me into his bedroom one day.    Come here, son-in-law, I want to  show you something.    So, I went into his bedroom. This is how I know  that these things do exist and the power of our God Almighty, the  Creator, is with us, because when he opened that medicine bag, he said,     Tell me what you see. Look in there.    I couldn   t believe my eyes  because when I opened it up, that little bag was about that round, but  when I looked in that bag, there stood a little white spirit buffalo at the  bottom of that bag. He said,    That is my medicine. That is my power.  That   s what  he  gave me.     So, I   ve seen things in my life that we artists try our best to bring forth to  the people. It   s not just making money. That   s not what it   s all about.  That don   t have no meaning to me. Money. What means to me is what I  can give that   s going to help somebody. I   m not trying to get away from  the subject here, but I   m going to tell you what happened. This young  man called me from Los Angeles, California. He was on drugs, dope,  alcoholic and everything. His life was ruined, but he had sense   good  sense. He said,    I went to one of your shows down there in Anaheim.  17  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  They were showing some Indian artwork down there and I seen this  painting and it spoke to me. I looked at it and I couldn   t take my eyes  from it. It was talking to me.    He said,    Don   t you know what? I bought  that painting. It   s hanging in my living room to this day.    And he said,     Let me tell you something, I used to be that kind of a person, but when  I bought your painting   and it   s hanging in my house   I   m not that  kind of person no more. See, Jesus Christ delivered me. He came in my  life and I cleaned up.    That   s what I like to hear. That   s when I know  what I   m doing is the right thing, when people say,    Hey, look what I  bought. I bought a Redbird spiritual painting.     I don   t just paint any paintings. I like to do something for the people  when I paint. There   s a message in those paintings that   s meant just for  them. I try to declare that in every piece of artwork I do today. As a  preacher and ordained minister, I stand by that. I don   t like to just paint  for the money. I like to paint to glorify my Father in Heaven and say,     Hey, this belongs to the people.    And that   s the way I really am. I live  that way every day. I   m not trying to build myself up. I   m telling you  how I am. That   s the way it is.  I remember when the Southwestern style became popular in the mid-80s  and R.C. Gorman was at his peak, but you also had a Southwest phase.  Was Gorman any kind of influence?  No. No, nothing. I   m going to tell you a story. A lot of people always get  this wrong. They say,    Well, you   re doing stuff like Gorman.    No. One  time I lived in Albuquerque years ago when I was a young man.  In your twenties or your thirties?  It was like in my early thirties. But here   s what a lot of people don   t  understand. I get so mad when they make this statement,    Oh, you   re  copying R.C. Gorman.    I   ve got news for them. No, I don   t copy  nobody. When  Gorman  came into my art gallery and sat down and put  his alcohol down there and started watching me paint, he was a young  man. Nobody knew who R.C. Gorman was back then.  What gallery was it, Robert?  It was just my art studio in Santa Fe. I had a private residence/art studio.  And he found out where I was at and he used to come and visit me and  watch me paint. I   m not going to say that he took from me, but I   m  pretty sure he did something there, because I did the early blanket  figures way before he ever did them. A lot of people say,    Oh you   re  copying R.C. Gorman.    No, I did not copy R.C. Gorman. I don   t know  where he got his style, but I   m pretty sure where he got it. He got it from  18  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  me. But I never said nothing to him. I don   t claim that. I don   t know.  And artists often influence each other     But he just sat there and watched me paint all the time before he was  anybody. One time, after years passed, bam, R.C. Gorman here, R.C.  Gorman there. Who is R.C. Gorman? Bam, bam, bam  R.C. Gorman  everywhere. He became so famous. More famous than I am. He was all  over the place, but I got to hand it to him. He did it. By gosh, he done it  and I was so proud of him. He was one of my friends. Some things I  didn   t like, but it   s his life. He can do what he wants to do. But I really  did like old R.C. We did many shows together. We had the same agent  out of London, England. And Mr.  John  Collier used to take our  paintings and take us around the world.  These are the things that I remember. R.C. Gorman was a show man.  I   m not kidding you  Boy, that guy could charm the pants off a woman. I  mean just BAM, he could charm the heck out of you  And the women  would just go for it. (Laughter) R.C. Gorman was a lady-killer. I used to  say,    Why do you do that? Don   t do that. They   re not interested in you.  They   re interested in your paintings.    (Laughter) But God knows that I  love R.C. Gorman. He was alright. I miss him. I miss doing shows with  him and traveling all over this country and around the world with him.  R.C. Gorman was a real good man, in his own way. You   ve got to  understand him. I understand him. I learned how to understand that man,  understand where he   s coming from and what he   s trying to do.  Just like every artist in the country. Just like your husband, Merlin.  Merlin   s got something to say and he   s doing a very excellent job of it.  He is one of the most dynamic artists alive today, as far as I   m  concerned. I   m not just saying that because you   re his wife, I   m saying it  because this man has the talent and he is awesome  So, that   s the thing.  There   s a lot of people like that in this United States of America. I   m  just tooting my horn about everybody because that   s the way I feel.  Robert, you were painting at the time of Jerome Tiger and Woody  Crumbo and a lot of artists who   ve gone on. Do you have any stories  you   d like to share?  I have all kinds of stories. And they   re all, good too  (Laughter) I   ll tell  you a story about Woody Crumbo. He was a very dear friend of mine.  He was my elder, my senior, but I looked up to that man and I respected  him. Woody Crumbo told me one time, he said,    Robert, one of these  days you   re going to be a very famous artist.    I was a young man back  then, but he says,    I can see great things coming about.    He said,    I   m  going to tell you one thing. A word of advice.    I said,    What is that?     19  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  He said,    When you become famous, and you will, remember what I tell  you. Do not do any lithographs, reproductions.    I said,    Why?    He said,     Because that   s where I made my mistake. A lot of people, when you  become so famous and you start reproducing your work, you   re going to  have a very difficult time selling that original. Anywhere you go   I  don   t care.    He said,    I can   t hardly sell my originals anymore.    And he  was well up in the years, an elderly gentleman. He said,    That   s the  advice I   m going to give you. One day when you come into your own  and you   re a very famous man, don   t let nobody out here try to sucker  you into making those lithographs. Don   t.    That   s why I never did  lithographs.  But you did do prints.  Lithograph prints or whatever? Yes, I did finally, eventually, give in and  he was right. I believe that when you reproduce your work, it knocks the  sales off from your originals. A lot of people will buy a print for fifty or  seventy-five dollars before they   ll buy a painting for  1,100. So that   s  what I found out and he was right. I did just like he told me not to do and  I found out that   s right. When you become well known to the point  where your life really depends on your artwork and you move to an area  that is not art-conscious, then they expect you to give them artwork for  nothing. This is what I want to encourage all young artists   don   t sell  your soul. I did the wrong thing. I didn   t listen when I should have and  now that I   m a famous artist   I mean, I   m a Hall of Famer four times. I  don   t have to have  anyone  tell me I   m famous, but the thing is, I don   t  let that bother me, anymore. I used to really think that being famous was  something, but it really isn   t. It doesn   t have no effect or nothing on my  life. It   s just that I know where I   ve been. I   ve been there and now I   m  back.  You had a story about Jerome Tiger.  Jerome Tiger was a very dear, dear friend of mine. Went to college  together. We wound up at Okmulgee Tech, Okmulgee, Oklahoma.  Jerome   oh, I loved his work. We were real good friends. I   m not going  to say the best of friends, but we were buddies. We were friends. He  used to come to my apartment when I was going to college there and he  used to sit there and watch me paint. And I used to go to his house and I  used to sit there and watch him paint. (Laughter) Next thing I know, I  did them slender figures where the wind is flat blowing. Like Jerome  Tiger. (Laughter) He said,    What is this? That   s my painting     and I  said,    No, it isn   t. That   s mine. I painted it.    And we just laughed. And  he would paint like me.  So you did try to imitate  each other ?  20  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Yeah, we did imitate each other   s. We painted after each other. One day,  he went home. That   s the last time I seen him. You know, a lot of people  do crazy things they have no business doing. Because he wasn   t that  kind of man. Russian Roulette with a gun, boom. Ended my friend   s life.  But at least I can say I knew him as a person. I knew what he was all  about because I knew Jerome. I knew him. He was a friend. We used to  chum around and go everywhere together in Okmulgee. And that   s how  I know Jerome Tiger. I know him. I know his work. He was one of the  most famous Native American Indian artists of his time.  Thank you for sharing that.  Solomon McCombs. Solomon McCombs. Archie Blackowl, Black Bear  Bosin, Woody Crumbo. All of these guys, all gone now. Now I   m the  old guy. I was in a show at Red Earth one year and I walked in the doors  and that guy knew me,    Ladies and gentleman, the boss is in the house.     (Laughter) I didn   t know what it meant back then.    Robert Redbird.    I  guess he meant that I   m a senior now and I   m just an old man now. I  don   t know. I said,    Oh my. No artwork though. Just me.    I was looking  at the show, looking at everybody. In fact, Merlin was there. Anyway, it  was kind of a funny thing.  Acrylic and gouache is your preferred medium?  Well, in the beginning it was just regular tempera watercolor. The very  beginning. Then later on, when I decided to get away from the flat, two-dimensional  ceremonial peyote paintings   they   re priceless right now.  You can   t get one from me. And if you do, you   ve got something.  I wanted to talk about those  early pieces  because they   re so striking. I  saw a print of one. There was an image of the buffalo in the clouds, but  it was snowy. There was a lot of landscape. You made a choice to move  away from that because   ?  Because of the economy. You   ve got to remember now, Indian artists  had to live by their wit. If you were good, you might make it. But if you  were not good and you tried to make it, it would be very difficult. I  know because I thought I was good enough to make it. This is the way I  feel about it. When you decide to do something, do it  Whether it be  good or bad, do it anyway. Because once it   s done, it   s been completed.  A lot of people don   t understand where I come from, but I understand  where I   m coming from because I   ve been there before. There   s a time  when I used to be a farmer. I did a lot of farm work for farmers out there  on the land. I used to drive a tractor. I used to drive a combine. I used to  plant seed. I used to do everything   work the cattle. I was a farmer. Ten  21  Little Thunder  Redbird  dollars a day. Back in those times, when I was young, ten dollars a day  was a lot of money. Believe it or not, it was. Twenty-five cents, you  could buy a gallon of gas with it   You can   t do it now, but that   s where I come from. Those days when I  had to work and I got cheap pay. Now I look at it and say I would not  dare go out and work for ten dollars a day. But when your babies are  little    All my children are grown up now. They   ve all got families and  are all grown up. They   re grown and left the home. I had thirteen  children, forty-five grandchildren, ten great-grandchildren and I   m still  with the same woman. And you know what? God has really blessed me  in that kind of life. Today, I   m still blessed. Today I   m still painting for  the people out there. I   m doing the best I can to bring them something  wonderful. My goal in life is to go out of this life painting, but I   ve got a  surprise for the people out there. The rest of my life, this year, I made a  resolution that this year I   m going to go and feed the people out there  my oils.  It   s time before it   s too late. Before it   s too late, I want the world to see  what I can do in oils. They are awesome. I can paint your face and it   ll  look like you   re   I mean, it   s so real. So real. That   s what I can   t hardly  wait to do   So, what is your creative process like when you get an idea?  Let me show you. Let me show you. There is none. Seems like you  would say,    Well, how do you do that? How did you get that idea?    I  don   t have to get no ideas. I   m schooled as an old man in the ways of  our people that I know enough that I can sit down and do anything I  want to do. Because I   ve lived to a ripe old age where I can see things  that the youngsters don   t see and know things that the youngsters don   t  know that   s trying to be artists. Artists going to and fro, just painting  anything. I don   t paint that.  Your husband is one of those good artists. He   s one of those that does  not mess around with make-believe art. He   s not a faddist. That man  knows what he   s doing. That   s the way I am. I know what I   m doing and  I don   t have to just make believe art. I paint the real McCoy. These  young guys out there, you know, are painting, but they   re doing stuff  that has no business being in there. In a painting, I mean. And they   re  getting away with it because the people are so   they don   t know what  they   re doing when it comes to buying art, so they just buy whatever  they get.    Oh, I like that. That   ll look good in my living room.    Or,     That   ll look good in my bedroom or dining room.    So, they go in and  buy something that really don   t have any meaning. It   s just an Indian  with all kinds of wishy-washy stuff in there. I don   t like to paint like  22  Little Thunder  Redbird  that. I like to paint real good, wholesome, quality, historical stuff.  I did a painting recently about the Kiowa warrior and the red wolf. Now  that   s a story that is true to our people. To be able to paint stuff like that  and bring it about in a work of art that is so beautiful. You   ve got the  spiritual warrior who is supposed to help this Kiowa warrior who is  wounded and nurtures him back to health by submerging him in the  water. Later on, when that warrior becomes well and heals up, what  happens? The wolf is by his side and they become great cunning  warriors and hunters.  These  people went down in history   in the  Kiowa history.  See, these things that I paint are real things. I don   t make believe art. No,  I don   t. I don   t care for it. I don   t approve of it, but then a lot of people  are doing it. They just put a mark here   boom, a circle or something and  then they sign it. That   s not art, to me. That   s scribbling. I want to see  some real stuff. Joe Beeler is probably one of the greatest artists I know  or did know when he was alive. I used to sit there and I used to admire  these guys. Not just Indian artists, but white guys that were really good.  And I said,    Oh my God, I don   t know how you do that. I wish I could  paint like that.     I used to watch Joe Beeler and I used to know these guys when I was  young. They   re a great inspiration to me in my life. They   re the ones that  showed me if you want to do something, you do it right. Because when  they paint, everything   every little rock and detail and weed and tree  and leaf   I mean, they   re good. You ever seen cowboy artists? I mean,  they are really good, and Joe Beeler was one of the finest. Peter Hurd  was another one. All the great artists of that time, when I was a young  man coming into my own, I knew these guys. That   s why I   m here  today. That   s why I   m the man that I am today is because of people like  them.  Do you do a lot of sketching, Robert, to prepare, like your warrior with  the red wolf?  No. I do not sketch. Everything that I do, I paint. I don   t sketch my  subject matter. I want to paint a horse and rider, it   s here. (Gestures) I  don   t have to sketch. Too much time. My time is valuable as an artist. I  make a living by painting. So I had to do without this. Oh, let me see if I  want to do   NO. I don   t have time to do that because I   m a famous  artist, because people want something. They want it now. I ain   t got time  to sit there for hours, trying to sketch out a painting. I just take my brush  and paints and start painting. That   s what experience can do for you. If  you don   t have to sketch, your idea is here. (Gestures) Your picture is  here. All you got to do is say,    Okay. I   m going to do it.    And do it  See,  23  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  that   s the thing I don   t do. I don   t like to sketch. To answer your  question, no. I don   t sketch.  To pick up on your airbrush again, a lot of your iconic pieces have that  black outline, but when it   s airbrush it becomes dimensional. It makes a  shadow.  Yea, you don   t have that line marking down. The reason why I do that is  because everything that I try to do is spiritual. I   m not doing it to box it  in. I feel like a painting shouldn   t be boxed in. I feel like a painting or  subject matter should be loose and free because that   s way it is supposed  to be. I don   t feel like you should make a circle and then just put a line  around that circle to where it just   I don   t like that because I   m a  spiritual man and everything that I deal with in my life is spiritual. I  don   t go for that starkness, that directness and stuff in art. I don   t like  that because I don   t want to see a line drawn around your body. I want to  see haze and a glow. That   s what I want to see. I want to see the aura  around you. And when you use an airbrush and do it that way, then it  separates, anyway   it   s going to separate, anyway. It becomes  dimensional.  This is the part that a lot of people don   t understand, the artist and why  he   s painting this way. Maybe this will help shed a light on that because  of who I am and how I want to tell the story. And the art   what life is  all about, for not only me, but what I   m trying to portray. These are real  things. They   re not just make-believe. All the things that I witnessed in  my elderly age, well, I could go into that, but I don   t think right now is  the time to talk about stuff like that.  Let   s talk about your signature. You sign your paintings with the black  and white eagle feather. How did that happen?  Okay, let me tell you. I used to not use that, but an incident happened in  Tulsa, Oklahoma. There was a guy named Robert Redbird who was  painting pictures over there. There was another Robert Redbird.  What tribe was he?  Cherokee. I was very shocked. I went to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Billy  Jean Williams came to my house and he said,    There   s a guy in Tulsa,  Oklahoma. He   s a Cherokee Indian and he   s claiming and pretending to  be you.    I said,    You   ve got to be kidding.    He said,    No. And this man  is painting pictures that don   t even come close to you.    I said,    That   s  one of the reasons why, I guess, this guy in Santa Fe that carries my  artwork in his art gallery at La Posada and I almost got in a fight. We  almost got in a scrap because he said,    Robert, what is going on here?  24  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Look at your artwork. It   s lousy.    I said,    Sir, that   s not my painting. I  don   t paint like that. You ought to know better than that.    He said,    No,  that   s your painting. It   s got your name.    I said,    That may have my  name on it, but I did not paint that.       And we almost got in and went Fist  City. (Laughter) He later on admitted that the Robert Redbird that sold  that painting to his manager was not me. And then he later on  apologized to me. So I know that there   s another Robert Redbird  somewhere around Tulsa, Oklahoma area that is painting or trying to  paint like me. I just want people to know,    Look out for this guy.     That   s all.  My signature   the feather. Where it came from was because of that man  in Tulsa. I used to just sign Robert Redbird, but I said,    Well, I   m going  to register this and I   m going to add a feather and copyright it.    And  that   s exactly what I did, and to this day, I   ve never heard nothing. So  that   s how that came about.  That solved that problem. (Laughs)  Yeah, put an eagle feather in there.  Humor doesn   t seem to play a big role in your work. Even with your  decorative images, everything is serious. The subject matter is serious.  The figures are usually serious. Any thoughts about that?  The reason why I don   t make fun with my artwork is because it   s not  fun. It   s a serious business. If you want to be a cartoonist, then you can  be a cartoonist and then it   s fun. But when you have a story to tell and it  reflects on your ancestral background, your culture, your life as a Native  American and your beliefs and your culture   the ceremonials that we  have   you ain   t got no time to be a comedian. You want to do the right  thing.  That   s the reason why I am a serious artist. I don   t play around with my  art. It   s really special to me and that   s how I look at it, that   s the way I  feel. You will never see me do a cartoon character. I ain   t got time to  waste my time with that. See, it   s the same way when you   re a believer  in Jesus Christ. You ain   t got time to mess around with this wishy-washy,     I   m going to church Sunday, but next Sunday I   m not going.     You want to be lukewarm? No. You   ll be right there for Christ Jesus,  just like you are in anything that you do.  Just like you are about what you   re doing here. You   re about what  you   re doing and you do it good. That   s the thing that I try to emphasize.  Be a man of precision thinking. Do it right. Don   t mess around with this  wishy-washy stuff. I don   t have time for it. I don   t have time for it in my  25  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  life. I   m getting to be an old man and my life is too short to play around  with my talent. I won   t play with it. That   s the reason you noticed that.  In my work, everything I do is the serious business. I   m not taking the  fun or joy out of painting. It   s more fun to me to paint something that   s  real than it is to make believe. So I   d rather do that than do make believe  and fool the people out there. Fool them. They   re not stupid people out  there in this world. So I try to keep my paintings as accurate as I can and  to the point.  Your props in many of images, like pots or a peyote fan, they   re very  important. Before you start a painting, do you already know what prop  is going to go with that particular figure? Do they come to you together  as an image?  I don   t have to think about it. I know. I know what belongs in that  painting. That one particular piece of artwork,    Should I put a pot in  there?       No, you don   t need to put a pot in this one.       Should I put an  eagle feather fin or a macaw parrot feather fin?    I already know, up here,  what that painting looks like. It just hasn   t surfaced yet. The reason why  I know that is because the good Lord has given me that vision of what I  need to do when a person tells me,    I   d like to have this kind of  painting.    Well, you   ve got to put your thinking cap on right now and  say,    She wants this kind of painting or he wants this kind of painting.     You start putting it together and make sure it   s right. When you put it  together up here and they look at it,    Wow  That   s exactly what I  wanted.    You   re on the right track. This is what I like to hear. This is  what I like to see, the happiness in their faces saying,    Oh, I just love it.     These are the things that I like to do. I don   t like to mess around and just  paint any old thing and say,    Here, take it or leave it.    No.  I noticed contrasting designs like in a calico shirt, for example, and the  blanket. So it   s not just colors, but patterns or designs that combine  some of those contrasts.  Well, this is make believe. I don   t know if they make Indian shirts those  colors, using those patterns. (Laughter) But art is art. Like I always tell  people, I   m the artist. I have the right to exaggerate from time to time.  (Laughter) It may be a different kind of shirt that   s not supposed to be in  there, but it   s still my shirt and I designed it and created it.  I went to an art show down in Phoenix, Arizona one time and the guy  loved my shirt so much that I caught him   what he was doing. He took  my design and he began to make shirts that I designed off of my  artwork. I looked over there and I couldn   t believe what I was looking  at. I told my wife, I said,    Look, do you recognize anything over there?      Gasps  She went like that.    Oh my God, those are your shirts     I said,  26  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird     Yes, they are. That man is copying my work and he copied my shirts.    I  had flower designs, design squares, blocks, everything. And nobody  painted like that. Nobody. Nobody made shirts like that. Those were my  designs. The guy went as far as copying my designs that I put in my  paintings and had those designs put on his fabric and then he made shirts  out of it. I could not believe it  I told him,    Sir, you   re infringing on my  rights.       I am?    I said,    Yes, you are. Let me show you something.     So I went back to my booth and I come back with a painting. I said,     You see that painting you got that shirt right there?    He said,    Yeah.        Now look at this.    (Laughter) Oh, his eyes got big.    Oh my.    I said,     You are copying my design and you know what, I can sue the heck out  of you for doing that. That   s my right, that   s my design. Not yours. And  you   re making shirts that come off of my images, and you   re making  money off of it? Where   s my percentage? Where   s my money?     I said,    I don   t do that to you. I don   t go around making shirts and  copying you, do I?    He said,    No.    I said,    Well this is my business. I  have a right to make a living and this is how I make my living. And  those are my designs you   re using. Look at that one over there. Look at  that one. Look at how you made them. They   re made exactly like my  shirts.    He said,    Well, what can I say?     Do you think he stopped?  He stopped. He stopped. My attorney made sure that he stopped. I took  one of his business cards and hooked him up with my attorney. Scared  him off. I never did see no more shirts after that. Anywhere. I didn   t  mean to kill his business. I just didn   t like it because he was copying my  design. You know? And that   s not right. I don   t do that to anybody as an  artist. I   ve got my own style. I don   t need to copy anybody.  Looking back on your career, what   s one of the moments when you were  at a fork in the road and you decided to go a particular way?  I decided to do that, be an artist, when I was young. I was about in my  late twenties, maybe thirties then, early thirties. I was on that tractor out  there, driving that tractor, plowing that field. I was an artist and I told  my wife. She said,    What are you doing home so early?    I said,    I just  made a decision in my life to do something with my talent. Why do I  want to play around with my talent when I   m farming out there? I   m  wasting my time farming when my heart   s not really in it. So I set that  tractor aside, Mom. I   m going to paint full-time and you watch. Things  are going to start happening.    And I shoved that tractor and farming  aside and never did drive a tractor ever since.  27  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  I   ve been painting ever since. I said,    This time it   s going to be done  different.       What do you mean?       Well, all the other times I was  practicing, fooling around. But no more fooling around. No more  pretending. No more just goofing off.    I said,    This is going to be my  main stream in life. This is how I   m going to take care of you and my  kids. I   m putting all this other stuff   that wishy-washy stuff   aside  and I   m going for it. I   m going to become one of the best artists in  America. That   s my dream one day.    Today, it   s realized that I am what  I said I was going to become. Why? Because I didn   t mess around no  more. My days of messing around were over. I pinpointed that spot in  my life and said,    That   s where I want to be.    And that   s where I am  today.  If you had to choose one high point of your career,  one  honor or  experience, what would that be?  Well, there   s a lot of them. It   s hard to choose. I mean here I am, sitting  here as an old man answering your questions and looking back on all the  accounts of my life, which was so miraculous. I have no detail of one  place or one thought because it was a glorious trip. Everything that I did,  I was the limelight. I was up there in the light. I was a star. I did  everything. I was the Man. I used to wear gold jewelry and all that fancy  stuff. I was the Man. I even glowed when I walk. This lady took a  picture of me. She said,    Oh my god, look at this.    I said,    What is it?    I  was in Palm Springs, California and it   s hot down there. I had on all  white. I wore white shoes. I still wear white shoes. Wear white pants,  white shirt and turquoise jewelry with gold. I had gold everywhere and I  walked out in that sun and that lady said,    Oh my god, I   ve got to catch  this.    She was just a lady taking pictures around Palm Springs and she  took a picture of me. And I swear, I glowed in that sunlight. There was  an aura, a white aura around me and to me, I thought I looked pretty  good. (Laughter) I thought I looked handsome. (Laughs) But anyway,  that was one of the most amazing, outstanding things that ever happened  to me in my life is to see that. I   ve never seen that never since. So, you  know, I must be failing or something. (Laughter). Fading away   my old  age.  What about one of the low points in your career?  My lowest point in my life is when I had open heart surgery. I wouldn   t  wish that on anybody. I thought I was going to die and I did for a  moment. Dr. Randall   I praise the Lord for his life   brought me back  that I can paint some more. But that was the lowest part in my life, when  I died and I came back from that. The good part about it is what  happened after I died. Life goes on. You don   t just die and this body  dies, but you live on. That   s the part that I want to tell everybody. Life  28  goes on and it   s beautiful. But, the lowest point in my life is when I died  and they had to call my wife and tell her. To see her expression     (Emotional) Excuse me. To see my wife   s expression when the doctors  told her that I failed, still brings  tears  to my eyes because I think about  my wife all the time. I love her. She   s my bosom buddy, my friend,  everything.  That   s what I saw. Her. A lot of people may think I   m crazy, but I   m  not. I saw my wife   s reaction when he told her I died. And she wept and  I felt so bad being over there where I was, looking at my wife. I wanted  to hold her but I couldn   t. That   s the reason why I paint the way I paint.  This is the reason why God made me the way I am as an artist, as a  human, a person. It   s because I got a lot to say and a little bit time left to  do it.  That   s the reason I told Joquita, my wife, I said,    Jo, I ain   t got much  time left in my life. Not too many years left now. I   m up in age, but what  I got left now, I would like to surprise the world because my work is all  over the world.    I said,    I would like to surprise them by doing these  beautiful oils and go out of this life painting oil paintings.    The people  will see something they   ve never seen before in Robert Redbird art, but  they have to see it. Then, they   ll know that I   m on my last road, my last  mile in this life. I have to complete it. That   s what I   m going to do. I   m  going to start very soon to do that. I   m just waiting for the right moment.  That moment is not now. I   ll know when the time is for me to do that.  But yes, that was the hardest thing for me to face.  My subject matter will be the same thing. The only thing is, it   ll be more  realistic. It will be more alive than ever. That   s the part I can promise  you. Watercolors, they   re fixed in their place and it   s stagnant. They   re  beautiful, but with oils, you have a spirit that   s going to dwell in those  paintings that   s going to come alive at you. Water-colors are    start,  finish, bam, it   s done     Not with oils. Oils, you have the freedom to  capture that spirit of that person, how he lives, how he looks and what   s  in his eyes. To see that expression in their faces, real expression, real  people, not watercolor people. That   s a whole different story, to go to  the heart of that person and say,    Hey, let me do you a picture   let me  paint you.    You   re going to capture the soul of that person. You would  see that person. That   s the reason why. You   ll have to excuse me. I   ve  got tears in my eyes, but you know what? I just think about stuff.  I think about that road that I was on in my spirit. The road was from here  and it was going this way. And it was going up there. (Gestures) And at  the end of that road was the biggest, brightest light you could see and in  that light was the Creator. Jesus, also, was there. I was walking on that  road and that angel came to me when I had my open heart surgery. I  29  thought I died   they said I was gone for a while   I saw that. This I   m  sharing with you because it   s real stuff. The angel took me by the hand  and said,    Do you see that line going over there?    I said,    Yes ma   am.        Go get in that line.    I didn   t know why I was going to get in that line. I  was already over there on the other side. And I got over that line and this  tall, big gentleman   white guy   he was standing there. Had the most  beautiful face and smile on his face, and he looked at me and he went  like this. (Gestures open arms) And I said,    Are you Jesus?    He said,     No. I   m just a saint just like you are.    And he put his arm around me  and gave me the biggest hug. And I said,    What is this?    He said,    You  see them people? You see this line? We   re all going to meet Jesus up  there. That   s where we   re going.     That   s what I saw when I had my open heart surgery. That   s the reason  why I can   t live any other way. That   s why I have to live the way I live  now because I got something to live for. Before, I didn   t have anything  to live for, but now I have something to live for. It   s not only just the  vision that I had, it   s because I read my word of God every day. I feed  on it. A lot of people say,    You come into the restaurant, but you never  eat. You always just drink coffee in the mornings.    I said,    Yes, I do.  I   m just not eating that food that you   re eating. I   m eating this food that  God has given me and it   s the meat of the word of God.    I   m having  breakfast. I   m feeding on the word of God. While you eat that natural  food, I   m eating that spiritual food. And you know what? That   s the way  it is. That   s the way I am. I can   t help it.  I remember back a long time ago when I first got into this artwork that it  was just fun. It was just a trip that I was going on and have fun and when  you get famous, you wear fancy clothes and belts and everything.  Money in the bank and all that. It wasn   t that way at all. It was a serious  business that you have to go through. You can   t just push it aside and  say,    Well, I   m going to       A lot of guys do that for the money. They  do it to whet their appetite as an alcoholic. A lot of our Indian people  who become Native American artists find it very easy to dip into the  alcohol bucket. To spend their money on drugs, dope and all that stuff  and a lot of them are doing it. I   m not going to kid you. There   s a lot and  they   re so good.  I   ve seen the artist   I   m not going to mention this name. It was one of  the finest Southwestern artists out of New Mexico or Arizona. He was  good. I used to hang out with him down in Scottsdale years ago. He lost  his wife in an automobile accident. One time I was in a bar in the  nightclub in Albuquerque in my drinking days, when I was carousing  around. I was sitting there with my back and I was leaning on the bar  like that and somebody came and tapped me on the shoulder. Now, let  me tell you something, the man that I knew before that was a very  30  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  handsome young man and he was very famous. More famous than you  can shake your stick at. What I saw when I turned around   I said,    Do I  know you?    I didn   t know him. His face was ugly. Alcohol. I didn   t  recognize him. It was one of the most famous Indian artists in America  standing before me like that, asking me to buy him a beer     Well, thank you, Robert. That   s a good warning of what to avoid, for  young people coming up.  I couldn   t help it. Yeah, I couldn   t help it. I had to tell that story. But  he   s an artist. Just like I am. Very famous, too. Very famous.  Alright, we   re looking at one of your pictures. Can you tell us about this  one?  This one is an original. It   s the best watercolor paper. I like to use this  paper.  It   s  suitable for anything. You can frame it any way you want  to. You don   t have to worry about the painting deteriorating and all that  stuff. This warrior is a sacred, holy man warrior. He is more or less like  representing this warrior that was in battle that I was telling you about.  The red wolf.  That one there is depicting that in a symbolic manner. That   s what he is,  he   s a Kiowa holy man. You can see that earring in his ear. That right  there is a typical traditional Robert Redbird, blanket style. But it   s also  got some, like I said, real sacred stuff to it. Like the red wolves, the  legend.  I   m going to zero in on the red wolves a little bit because those are  wonderful designs.  How about  this painting?  This painting is called The Spirit of a Nation. It   s about a 32 x 40 inch.  It   s what I was referring to earlier when I was talking about Rudy  Giuliani in New York City. This is one of those pieces that would go  into that category of historical pieces. It just so happens that we find it  here in the gallery. I   m so thankful that we have it because it shows you  my blanket style. It shows you this technique that I have. I noticed that  throughout my experience as an artist, there   s nobody using this  technique anywhere in this country. I developed it and a lot of people  always ask me,    How did you do that?       Well, I   m going to tell you  how I do it, but I doubt that you   ll ever get really to the point where you  can do it like this.     What I did is, I got me a bowl of water and I got that aluminum foil and  I squashed a big gob of that up into a small ball. I had that basin there  with the paint, and I dipped it into the paint. And when you dip, it   s  31  Little Thunder  Redbird  Little Thunder  Redbird  crunched up so tight that it   s got all kinds of wrinkles and all kinds of  stuff in there. It   s hard to do. It   s very hard to use it, but it   s my  technique. I did it. I created it and designed it. This was done with a ball  of aluminum foil all crushed up. It   s dipped in the water and the water is  dripped off from that aluminum foil, and what   s left in there is put on  this on the flat surface. This is laid flat and then I put water on there.  That   s the technique that I devised.  That   s neat. I   m going to focus in on your signature a little bit. Okay, on  to the next one.  This is titled, The Corn Maiden. I got this idea living in Albuquerque  many years ago, to paint the ladies in their blankets with a kiva   backdrop . It   s more Southwest. I captured the Southwestern traditional  ways. The corn represents the harvest time, their going into the fields  and working. And this is the blessed water of life that they use. They  bless and they pray over this water, so that the crops will grow and this  is what that   s all about right there. The Southwest contemporary style.  The Corn Maiden of the Southwestern tribes. Typical Redbird style.  Thank you very much, Robert, for sharing that with us.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
