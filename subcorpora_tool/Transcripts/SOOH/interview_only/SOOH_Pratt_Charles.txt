 Little Thunder  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, March 4, 2011.  I   m in Gallup, New Mexico, at the home of Charles Pratt. Charlie,  you   re a Cheyenne-Arapaho tribal member. You   re an incredibly  versatile figure, a very important Indian sculptor. Can you tell us where  you were born and where you grew up?  I was born at Concho, Oklahoma. It   s a Cheyenne-Arapaho Indian  Agency, and I went to school there for six years, from third to the ninth  grade or the tenth grade. I forget now.  You   re a descendant of a famous trader named William Bent, who  founded Bent   s Fort. Can you tell me a little more about that, if it   s on  your mom or your dad   s side?  It   s on my mother   s side. My mother was Cheyenne and Sioux and  French and English, and my father was a full-blooded Arapaho.  Sometimes when you have both Cheyenne-Arapaho ancestry, one will  choose to be raised one way or the other. Did you have to choose?  (Laughs)  Yes, I claimed the Arapaho blood because there   s more of it, and I grew  up without knowing my father. He died at the age of forty-two. I was  seven years old.  That must have been hard for you. Is that when you went to live with  your grandfather, around that time?  Yes. My grandfather helped my mother raise her children.  So that was your mom   s father?  5  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Yes.  What do you remember about growing up with him?  That he kept us under control. There was four brothers. I was right in the  middle of four younger brothers and three older sisters. He kept us well-disciplined  and taught us how to make clay models.  Where did you get your clay?  He would get it from the river, river beds or river banks.  What were the kinds of things that you and he would make?  They related to farming and ranching and horses. We would build  corrals and barns and stock them with the horses and cattle, and we  would make wagons and make whole scenes with that.  I imagine you didn   t have a lot of extras for toys or anything, so that was  your entertainment.  Yes.  Did your grandfather notice that you had an unusual ability for  sculpting?  No, he didn   t give any attention to one. He just taught us how to form  them, and we took it from there.  He was glad that you were occupied. (Laughs) Did you do any wood  carving at a young age?  No, I don   t remember doing any wood carving.  When you were at Concho going to boarding school was there any art  instruction?  No, none. We had to work all the time. We were given assignments. We  got up early, and we started working right away. We worked in the  kitchen and the administration and clean-ups. Even had their own farms  that we worked on. I remember one of my jobs was to feed the hogs first  thing in the morning, early. I pulled a cart down to the stables and fed  the hogs. That   s where I got the idea for a turquoise corn sculpture.  I fed a can of corn in the slop bucket. Each slop bucket, I emptied a can  of corn in there. Later years when I was doing sculpture, I was running  6  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  my hand through some turquoise nuggets, and I thought,    Well, that  would be perfect for the corn,    so I made corn out of it.  It was like a sense memory?  Yes.  The focus in those days was on learning a trade, manual work, not much  opportunity for     Well, I first started out as a painter because I didn   t have the equipment  to do sculpture. That   s what I had in mind, but I started out as a painter.  By the time I finished high school, while I was in high school, I was  selling my paintings.  Ok, great. So you were painting flat style with Tempera  paints ?  Yes.  Who were you selling to?  Well, I remember there wasn   t too many places for you to go to sell  things. The only one that I knew was in Oklahoma City. I went in there,  and I was trying to show him my paintings. He finally looked at them,  and he said,    No, I can   t use any of these.    As I was going out the door,  I seen a Woody Crumbo silkscreen. I forget how much it was, but I  asked. I told him that I would trade him all the paintings I had (I  probably had about fourteen or fifteen small ones) for that, and he says,     All right.    That was just to get my foot in the door. (Laughs) Next time  I came in, he says,    Have you got any more of those?    I said,    Yes sir,  I   ve got some little paintings,    and that   s how I got started with him.  So you didn   t know Woody Crumbo   s art, did you? Were you familiar  with his art? Aside from that silkscreen, had you seen his work before?  Yes.  You kind of ended up with a valuable thing, too, and got your foot in the  door. (Laughs) Did you see Dick West   s art and Archie Blackowl   s quite  a bit, too, growing up?  Yes, yes.  Do you think they were influences on your painting when you started  out?  7  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Oh, yes. I tried to copy them all.  (Laughs) That   s how good artists learn. In public school, Indian kids  weren   t always treated on an equal basis with white kids. The public  school teachers in El Reno, did they recognize your talent at school?  Yes, yes. Well, I   m light-complected, for one thing. It   s been a plus and  a minus, both. When I was in school at Concho with all those boys, at  first it was hard because I was light-complected, and I was always  getting into fights. Then it was a plus when I was in public schools.  Because they treated you a little better because you weren   t so dark-complected?  Yes.  What kinds of encouragement did  teachers offer? Just told you you did  a good job?  They had competitions, and I won some of them and lost a few. I   m  seventy-three years old now, and I   m still competing against the younger  generation.  And still winning awards, too. (Laughs) One of your first jobs was at an  auto body repair shop. Is that right?  Yes.  I think you created one of your first artworks there, in sculpture. Can  you tell us what happened and where you were working? I think you  made a shield.  Yes, I made the Oklahoma state flag. I made the emblem off of that in  metal from car parts. I had it hanging on my wall, and somebody wanted  it. When I found out that people wanted those things, I started making  them.  And you used an acetylene torch at that point? Can you explain what it  is for people? It   s involved with welding, right? It   s a welder   s tool.  Yes, you can weld steel with it, and you can braze brass on metals,  different metals, with it.  It actually has a small flame, but it   s very intense heat.  Yes, you can get a jeweler   s torch or commercial industrial type torches.  8  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  How early would you say you knew you wanted to be an artist?  I knew when I was in high school.  When you were doing the painting?  Yes.  But that first shield, State of Oklahoma symbol, did that start triggering  more ideas? Was that kind of a turning point for you to get into  sculpture, or did you continue your painting for a while?  I continued the paintings because I couldn   t afford the equipment for the  metal.  Once you started selling those shields, did the sculpture begin to kind of  fund itself?  Yes, I was making all kinds of things with scrap metal out of the body  shops that they were throwing away. I was making things out of them.  When did you place your first sculpture in a gallery?  Gee, I don   t   I can   t remember.  Do you remember one of the first galleries you started dealing with?  I had an older man help me when I first got out of high school. I was  already selling a few paintings. His name was Woodrow Big Bow. I got  acquainted with him, and I would drive for him. He made the insignia  for the 45th Division of the Oklahoma Army, the thunderbird. He needed  me to help him drive to different cities, and he would sell my paintings  along while he was selling his.  Yes, because he was an artist, Woody Big Bow. So he sort of became the  way that you got acquainted with some different galleries or outlets?  Yes.  Did you do any early mall shows, Charlie, with your sculptures?  Yes, Shepherd Mall in Oklahoma City was the first mall show.  And who were the other artists that were showing at that time?  9  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  That Seminole man.  Kelly Haney?  No. It was   gosh, I can   t remember his name right off hand. He was an  older gentleman. He was at the shows all the time. He was always  dressed nice. He always had white shoes on.  Fred Beaver   Anybody else you can think of, off the top of your head?  A Davis. He was a painter. Kelly Haney was one of them. You  mentioned him. He was at the shows.  How much were you charging for your     All I could get. (Laughter) I don   t remember the prices.  What was the attitude of the public at the mall shows? Was there quite a  bit of interest?  No. I started full time in    69, so from the    60s until now, I   ve been doing  Native American art shows and galleries.  When did you meet Delores and start a family? Was that prior to 1969?  Yes, I think it was in    64, something like that.  Did Delores help with the business at all?  Oh, yes. She was   she had a good personality. She was always willing  to talk to everybody, and she kept me pretty straight.  Good representative when you were set up with a booth or whatever?  Yes.  You started your own foundry, didn   t you, Charlie?  Yes. I was taking my artwork to a foundry in Ruidoso, or I would send it  there on a bus to this foundry, and they would cast bronzes for me. I had  no idea. Well, I   d done a mall show with a bunch of other artists that  were not Native Americans, and I got acquainted with some of the  people that had bronzes. This one said he had a foundry in Ruidoso, and  he   d be glad to cast my stuff. So I   d send it to him, and he   d cast them.  One day, I went down there to pick some up. I drove down there, and I  10  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  wound up staying for two weeks. I told him I would work for free just so  I could learn the process. He says,    Yes, I   ll be glad to have you for  free.    (Laughter) He said he   d built all the equipment himself. He had a  book on how he built it all, so he gave me a copy of the book. It was just  small, individual pages. I took it, and I built my own foundry in  Oklahoma City and ran it for three years.  Wow  I was wondering because it   s expensive to cast, isn   t it?  Bronzes are expensive. That   s how come they   re so high. If you get  somebody to cast them, it costs quite a bit.  So when you were having the Ruidoso place cast for you, was it just you  and Delores kind of saving your money from the art and reinvesting it?  Yes.  When you built your own foundry, that must   ve been, even though you  built it from scratch, did you have to hustle, kind of? Did you get an  investor to help you?  Well, I ran it for three years, and found out that it   s not what I wanted.  (Laughter) Were you doing other people   s work, at that point?  Yes, yes. People started coming to me, and I couldn   t get any work  done.  Right. (Laughs) What were some of the first competitive shows?  The first one I remember was at Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa. I won a  prize for the Tall Cheyenne, and it was a piece of sculpture only that big.  (Gestures)  It was a miniature. Oh my goodness. And it was welded?  Welded, yes.  It must   ve had some beautiful detail that impressed them. (Laughs) Did  you ever enter the Philbrook Annual?  Yes. Yes, I won best of show there the first time I entered, with Corn.  With Corn, using your trademark turquoise. There were many more  painters than sculptors, probably, and there probably weren   t too many  Indian sculptors working in metal, were there, in Oklahoma?  11  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  No, the only one I knew of was Allan Houser, and I   ve had shows with  him in Chicago.  Wow. Was this in the    70s?  Yes.  And what was that like, because that was probably new for them in  Chicago? Did you have a good reception for the art?  Yes. It was called the Squash Blossom Gallery. It was in Highland Park.  It   s an upscale place.  Was it a two-man?  No, it was a three-man show.  You and Allen Houser and     And a jeweler from Phoenix, Preston Monongye.  I   d like to ask about Santa Fe Indian Market first. When did you do your  first Indian Market show?  I think it was in    72 or    73.  You were still living in Oklahoma City, right?  Yes.  It   s kind of a different market, a different atmosphere. What were your  thoughts when you did that show? Did you just think this might be a  good place to be selling art?  Yes, I had people buying my artwork that lived in Oklahoma, and they   d  go to Santa Fe to buy it. (Laughter) When they found out I lived right  there in Oklahoma, they   d say,    Oh, we didn   t even know it      (Laughter)  That   s the paradox of Santa Fe for a lot of Oklahoma artists. You had  that small winning sculpture at Gilcrease that you told me about. How  soon did you move into larger works, outdoor sculpture types of work?  Was it from the very beginning, or did you kind of find your way into  doing larger pieces?  12  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  I was always looking for somebody that wanted something big, and I  always found them.  Oh, okay. So you would do the larger piece first? It wasn   t like  commissions where somebody would say   .  Both commission and   I always do things that I like, and for some  reason, they sell.  Because they   re beautifully done. Do you have to think a little bit  differently when you   re doing a larger outdoor sculpture?  Oh, yes.  What are some of the things you have to consider?  The actual size, the placement, and the perspective.  So you   ll go check out the site.  Yes. You can do something large, and it   ll be out of proportion when  you   re standing on the ground looking at it, and you have to think of all  those kind of things.  You showed quite a bit overseas, too. Can you talk about some of the  highlights of some of the places that you showed your artwork and some  of the memories that stand out the most for you?  I had a one-man show in Wiesbaden, Germany, and the gallery took  good care of me. I   ve done a show in Rennes, France, at the Franco-  American Museum. I   ve done shows in Switzerland, Austria, and Italy.   I was in Venice and they were bringing our luggage off the boat. The  streets were filled with water and they were putting them on the dock.  One guy says in English,    Who   s from Oklahoma? Is he Indian? He  hollers to another guy in Italian, and this big tall guy runs over and hugs  me, lifts me right off the ground. I told him,    Put me down, or I   m going  to slap your ears.    Turns out, he   s half Indian and half Italian, and he   s  never met an Oklahoma Indian before. So I told the guy who spoke  English,    Well, tell him I   m not his daddy.      Did you get to look at any sculpture on your travels?  Oh, yes, I did. I wanted to see the marble quarries in Carrara  Italy . I  wanted to see those, and we drove up there. They was bringing things  down, solid pieces as big as a semi-trailer. As we were going up there, I  could see the river on the passenger side, and it was just white like milk,  13  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  from them cutting that stone up there, that white marble, and it going  down in the river.  Wow. I bet you were wishing you could bring some back. (Laughs)  Yes, I was going to buy some. That   s what I had in mind. They said,     We   re going to ship it to you.    They was telling me if I bought some,  they could ship it to me, and it would go all the way on water. It would  go in the Gulf of Mexico, and come up the Mississippi, and go to the  Arkansas River to Tulsa, and I could pick it up there, but I didn   t do it.  Oh my goodness. Would it have just been insanely expensive?  Yes. (Laughter)  When was the first time you did Gallup Inter-Tribal Ceremonial Art  Show?  In    69, I think it was.  From the very beginning?  Yes.  Did Woody let you know about that show?  I can   t remember how   oh, yes, I do. My mother used to bring me to  Gallup to visit and participate in the dancing part when we were young,  the powwow, so that   s how I got started. I seen all the artists that were  set up here, so I looked it up, after, and    69 was the first time I came.  So you did some straight dancing when you were little, or traditional?  War dancer.  When did you make the move from Oklahoma to New Mexico? What  prompted that move, and when did you make it?  It   s a career move because of the people buying my artwork that didn   t  even know me  in Oklahoma . I thought,    Well, if I   m living there, I can  do better than what I   m doing here.    So in    83, I think, I moved. I think  that   s when I moved to Santa Fe. I lived for twenty-three years or  twenty-two years there in Santa Fe.  And it   s kind of high cost of living, isn   t it? Kind of a tradeoff. Were you  in several galleries there?  14  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  No, just one.  Mainly, people came out to your studio to buy from you directly.  Yes.  When and how did you meet Bobbie?  I met her in Santa Fe.  At a show? (Laughs)  Yes. There were several of us having a show with Tom Woodard. She  came to that gallery, and that   s where I met her.  What does Bobbie take care of, in terms of the art business? What does  she help with?  The book work and advising and loading and unloading.  Yes. (Laughs) That   s a big job when you   re a sculptor. Did you ever get  family members to help, too?  No.  Pretty much, you did it yourself or with Bobbie. You did a sculpture for  the Murrah Building. Were you there when it was installed in Oklahoma  City?  Yes, yes.  But then, of course, there was the bombing of the Murrah Building.  There was three pieces that survived, and mine was one of them. All  they had to do was set it back up. It was ready to go. It was metal. They  found it in the rubble. They asked me what to clean it up with, and I told  them,    Just wash it off. Wash it off and re-wax it.    It   s in the permanent  collection. All of them are there, the ones that were destroyed, that they  had the artists rebuild them or build new ones. They got a collection in  the library at  University of Central Oklahoma  in Edmond.  You   ve been deeply involved with the American Indian Arts and Crafts  Association  IACA , and they named you Indian Artist of the Year two  years in a row in 2003 and 2004, and they also gave you their Lifetime  Achievement Award.  15  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  That was in    85 and    91 or    92. I forget, now.  What was that like to receive those awards from that prestigious  organization?  It was a great time. It was a great time.  Robert Tsosie, who   s become a well-known sculptor in his own right,  apprenticed with you. Can you tell me how that came about?  I had three helpers in Santa Fe, and he was working for me for six years.  I decided to move to Gallup. I can   t remember what year he quit, or I  told him he   s on his own, and he   s making a living out of it.  What prompted your move from Santa Fe to Gallup?  Santa Fe was changing, and it was getting so expensive to live there.  They diagnosed me with Parkinson   s, so I had to slow down a little bit.  We looked for a place all over the country, and we finally wound up  here.  And it   s a really nice place that you have your studio in, too. Your  brother, Harvey Pratt, is a well-known Indian painter. Have you ever  collaborated with Harvey on anything?  Where to go to dinner. (Laughter)  Has Harvey ever done any sculpture?  Oh, yes.  Has he ever sought your advice on it?  No, he don   t need my advice. He   s pretty well-rounded.  You won first place in sculpture at Red Earth in 2009 with a wood  sculpture, and we   re going to look at a sample of your wood sculpture  here at the end. Was that your first wood sculpture that you entered in a  competition?  Yes. I can   t remember what it was, now.  What drew you to wood after you   d worked in these other media?  Oh, I   m always looking for something new. I taught myself how to  silversmith since I   ve been in Santa Fe, and I   ve been selling jewelry.  16  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  It   s just another outlet.  Some of those small sculptures are almost like jewels when you combine  the metal and the gemstones. We   re going to talk a little bit about your  philosophies and practices of art. Even though you started out in metal,  you do bronzes. You   ve done stone sculptures, I understand it.  Yes.  Wood, and then dichroic glass?  That   s in the jewelry.  What factors influence what medium you choose to work in? Is it  because you have an image in your head and you know that it   s going to  work better in one medium than another?  I think it   s mostly color that makes me see something.  Okay. So it   s the color and the association with that image of what you  want to do. You do quite a bit of human figure subject matter, but  another important vein for you is subjects that relate to Indian beliefs,  like Corn Mother or Little People. I know you do a wide range of  animals. Do you think your subject matter has changed over the years?  No. It has mostly to do with nature.  How about moving from Oklahoma to New Mexico? Sometimes the  environment will change the way you look at your art. Do you think  that   s been much of a factor?  No. No, I don   t think it influenced me at all.  You   re down from three assistants, I guess, to one assistant now. Can  you explain how that works for you, what your assistant helps you with?  Well, now I   ve gotten older, and I   ve got Parkinson   s, I need some help  with the heavier things, or I need to rest. I   m glad that there   s somebody  there that I   m teaching while I   m at it.  In the beginning, did you sketch a lot, Charlie, when you were doing  your preliminary concepts? Is sketching very much a part of your  sculpture, or do you just work directly?  Oh, I sketch. I get some ideas. I get ideas at night, and that   s when I   ll  make some sketches so I don   t forget.  17  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  As soon as you wake up, you make your sketch.  Yes. And then some things I just start making right away. I already  know what needs to be done.  What role does story play in your work? Do you have stories for your  sculptures?  All of them, every one of them. Sometimes you can get them out of me,  and sometimes you can   t. (Laughter).  Does that just depend on whether you feel like sharing the story or not?  Yes. I had a blind man buy five pieces at one time. He couldn   t see  them, but after I got through talking to him and explaining them to him  and letting him feel of all of them, he bought five of them.  Oh, wow. What a neat experience. Looking back over your career, are  there any awards that you consider more important than other awards?  No, I don   t think so. They all came at the right time.  When do you think was a turning point in your career, an important  turning point?  I can   t remember what it would be.  How about something that was a high point in your career, that you look  back on as a real high point?  I guess it was when I won the Indian Arts and Crafts award the second  time. When somebody finally won it for the second time, I told them,     Welcome to my world     (Laughter)  Because I think there   s only two of you that have won it twice in a row.  Yes.   Paul Harvey   s secretary called me one time after he bought some of my  art. She said Harvey wanted to see me, wanted me to come to the house  next time I was in Phoenix. I had a dirty, beat up old car and I pulled up  in front of this large mansion, looked like a Roman Catholic church. I  knocked on the door and the butler came and said,    What do you want?  Well, go around back.    So I did, and knocked again, and he said,    Now  what do you want? I said,    I   m supposed to have lunch with Paul  18  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Harvey.       Then go to the front, go to the front.      What was one of the low points in your career?  Haven   t gotten there yet. (Laughter)  But you   ve faced some challenges with this Parkinson   s.  Yes, it   s slowed me down a little bit.  Is your creative routine pretty much     Oh, I still get all kinds of ideas, too many. (Laughter)  Seven days a week, right? Up every day, ready to go into the studio. Are  there any brand new media or formats that you   re thinking about  working on in the near future that you haven   t tried yet?  No, none right now.  What advice would you give to a young Indian sculptor that was just  starting out in the business?  When you   re in business for yourself, you   ve got to be a bookkeeper,  promotion, and new ideas all the time.  Sometimes artists don   t want to deal with that bookkeeping and  promotion.  Well, they   d better learn.  Yes, it   s a big part of it. Because of the use of precious gemstones and  such with your metal sculpture, because of the way you incorporate  them, did you ever have a piece at a competition where somebody  wondered where it belonged in terms of categories?  Yes.  When was that? Just some of the earlier shows?  I remember there was a judge that told me, he says,    I remember that we  explicitly said that there would be no kind of plastics.    And he says,     What do you do? You show up the next time with a plastic sculpture.     (Laughter) He said,    But we had to give it a prize.     Do you remember what show that was?  19  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  Pratt  Little Thunder  It was one of the IACA shows.  Was it fiberglass?  Yes, fiberglass.  Was it a horse, by chance?  Yes.  I think I remember one of those really nice fiberglass horses. Is there  anything that we   ve forgotten that you   d like to add before we take a  look at your sculptures?  No, I don   t think so.  Well, we   re going to switch focus. What I   ll have you do, Charlie, is talk  about the sculptures individually.  This is called Blue Corn, and the material is sheet bronze and bronze  tubing. It   s fabricated out of 50,000 sheet bronze and several different  sizes of tubing. The base is lava rock, and it comes from the middle of  the earth, and I start at the roots. This Native American corn can grow  anywhere. I start at the roots to show that that   s a way of life. It   s hard,  but this corn is a staple for the Native Americans. It goes on up, and it  comes to the fruit which sustains life. The top tassel is religion. They use  it in ceremonies, the corn pollen.  That   s great.  This is a cast bronze. It   s about nine inches tall, and it   s called Little  Feather. It   s a little female pony. She   s real ornery. (Laughter) Every  other week they had to have a giveaway and give her away because her  keepers don   t want her there no more. When they first see her, they think  she   s so pretty, but she   s ornery. She opens all the gates, knocks over the  outhouse, runs, breaks the fences down, chases people, so the next time  they have a giveaway, they give her away. (Laughter)  Can you explain, Charlie, about a giveaway?  It   s performed at gatherings to honor your friends or your relatives, and  you give them gifts and honor them.  And do you have a kind of series of her?

(Laughs) I thought so. I thought I recognized her. So is this just one of  her stances, or are they all different variations?  No, they   re all the same.  On the subject of horses, Charlie, did you ride horses growing up?  Yes, I used to ride horses for people that came to the giveaway.
