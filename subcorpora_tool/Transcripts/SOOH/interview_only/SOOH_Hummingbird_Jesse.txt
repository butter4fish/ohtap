 Little Thunder  Hummingbird  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Monday, April 7,  2014, and I   m interviewing Jesse Hummingbird for the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at the Wheeler  Taft Abbett Library in Tucson, Arizona, where Jesse met me. Jesse,  you   re a Cherokee tribal member who   s painted professionally for a  long time. You   ve always had a very distinct style, and in addition to  winning top awards at major art shows, a feature article in Native  Peoples magazine, numerous books, and being designated Indian Artist  of the Year by the Indian Arts and Crafts Association (IACA), you   ve  done a lot of fun commission work, so I look forward to hearing more  about that today. Thank you for meeting with me.  My pleasure.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, February 12, 1952. That   s  Lincoln   s birthday. I at least had that in common with someone famous.  I was born at the city hospital turns out, not the Indian Hospital. Why? I  don   t know. When I was a little bit less than a year old, (my dad, he   d  married my mom, he had five previous kids to support, and learned and  became a welder) we moved to the Deep South, South Carolina. He  worked on first reactors that they put in down at the Savannah A-bomb  plant, as we used to call it. Off and on through the years, Oklahoma, the  South, and eventually worked for TVA  Tennessee Valley Authority , so  we ended up in Nashville, Tennessee, where I went to junior high, high  school, and part of college. I have a southern background.  Through the years, maybe a year, half a year in Oklahoma during layoffs  and stuff like that, or an illness, my mother had to tend to family back  there, and it kind of separated our family. My brother Eddie and some of  5  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  his brothers, they grew up more in Oklahoma than I did and lived with  my Grandma there in Tahlequah. My Dad   s folks were all gone, so my  real connection to Oklahoma is through my mother   s family, the  Bracketts, and my grandma was a Batt. We had uncles and aunts that  lived out in Welling, Oklahoma. I know about Barren Fork and the  Illinois River, and I have a lot of fond memories from summers on my  Uncle Buzz   s farm.  Yeah, I was going to ask you about your relationship with your  grandparents on either side.  I only had the one grandparent, and that was my grandmother, Jane  Brackett. My grandmother Ragsdale on my dad   s side, she had passed  way before I was born, and his dad took him and his twin siblings to  Sequoyah to be taken care of there. At that time, it was kind of like a  boarding orphanage. Then his dad would take them out so they could  help on the farm and stuff in the summertime. Really, he was almost  brought up like an orphan. My grandma was the only one, although I  think of my Uncle Buzz as my grandfather figure. He kind of played the  more traditional Indian uncle. My mother   s brothers had their own  families and could care less about being Indians.  Were you around the language at all?  When I was small, my grandmother could read and write Cherokee, and  throughout the years she lost the ability to write it fluently. In the old  days, whenever I was a pre-teen, I remember her friends and a couple of  medicine people, and they would sit and converse in Cherokee. Os i yo,  do hi tsu  hello, how are you  is about all I can say, and a few words. It  really is a use-it-or-lose-it language, even though my Navajo friends say  theirs is the hardest language. (Laughter)  Did you have any artists in your immediate or extended family?  My dad, he did a little bit of bead work, and he drew a lot. Then as he  got older and worked more over time, he lost that ability. Everybody  else in my family, I thought, was so much smarter than me, that art was  the thing that could separate me from them. Being the dumb one, it  turned out the difference was they took books home, and they worked  harder at school. (Laughter)  So you   re spending a lot of your primary, elementary school years in  North Carolina or in Tennessee?  South Carolina.  6  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Yes, South Carolina, sorry.  There is a big difference. (Laughs)  Yes, there is a big difference. Were you often the only Native kid in your  classroom?  Well, about the only decent housing they had whenever we went down  there was government houses. They weren   t projects; they were  individual little houses. For one year, there was an Indian family, and  they had three boys: one about my age and the other two older. Every  now and then, they would say,    Okay, let   s play Cheyennes and  Cherokee.    (Laughter) Other than those folks, no. It was pre-   I got a  grandma that was a Cherokee.    It was pre-those days. If they would   ve  been, they wouldn   t have probably admitted it. We always were Indians  with my last name. If you saw my dad, you   d think he stepped off the  nickel. His profile and everything looked like that, so we were always  the Indians.  The school board actually met when we moved down there, (I wasn   t in  school) whether my brothers and sisters were going to go to the black  school or to the white school because it was the segregated South,  Apartheid, probably pretty much like South Africa. I mean, I grew up  with black and white water fountains and no integrated restaurants and  things like that. Luckily I was a cute kid, and so it was no big deal being  a cute little Indian boy. We had a visit from the Ku Klux Klan one time  at the house when I was young, over an incident on the school bus. My  mother overreacted, and turned out this kid   s dad was a Klan member.  He had a little cross, and they knocked on the door. Some threats were  made, but my mother didn   t take threats kindly.  Thank you for sharing that. What is your first memory of seeing Native  art?  Well, my dad was working on a vocational education degree, and he  went to Bacone  College . I kind of remember going to Agency Hill and  seeing the Five  Civilized  Tribes Museum. It was the good old stuff,  Tigers, and Crumbos, and Acee Blue Eagle. That stayed in my mind,  and whenever I got older and started painting, I was more of surrealist. (I  call myself a distortionist. Thought I   d be real creative.) I didn   t want to  do Indian art because I thought it was a dead end street. The good stuff  had already been done. It turned out one of my relatives was Cecil Dick  that lived there in Tahlequah. I would go and visit him whenever I got  into college age, and we spent a lot of good time together, have beers,  and smoke, and talk. The man was so well versed in art. Everybody  thinks,    Indian art, Indian art.    If you don   t know, Cecil was one of the  7  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  first non-Kiowas that went out to Dorothy Dunn   s studio in Santa Fe.  We   d talk Renaissance and everything else. He said,    Jesse, when you  going to do Indian art? Jesse, when you going to do Indian art?    I said,     I don   t know, Cecil,    because Cecil painted old school, too. He was  right. One day I was messing around, and inspiration hit. By then, there  was more contemporary stuff being done, late   60s going on early   70s,  that wasn   t in the old traditional style. Don   t get me wrong. I love old  traditional stuff. That   s my first memories, going up to Agency Hill. On  the campus of Bacone at that time, you could still see some of the  influences from there.  What about your first memory of making art?  It   s probably not until I was almost a teenager because my first  experiences that I put aside were horrible. People in my family made fun  of it, so I just didn   t share it with anybody. I kind of remember buying  one of those little long strips of watercolor, and that horrible brush, and  some pencils, and that   s probably around twelve, thirteen.  When you were around your other siblings, were they also  experimenting with art or not?  No, they all had a kind of ear for music instead. Either they were  greasers who didn   t care a thing about school, or they were very smart.  My older brother and my brother Eddie, they all studied science and  things like that. My one sister was good in math, and art might   ve  seemed like a waste of time to them.  Did you have any art experiences in the public schools at the elementary  or junior high level?  In junior high, I had an art class. I had a friend at the time, and we just  were a couple of goofs. They gave us a bunch of crayons. I mean, here  we are teenagers, and they gave us crayons and some paper. We started  doing monster pictures of each other, and the teacher actually came by  and encouraged me. That was the first encouragement I ever got. Her  name was Ms. Gilcrease, and I   ll always remember her for that. For an  hour a day in this horrible inner-city school in Nashville where people  were aging out in the seventh grade (they were going on eighteen, they  had to quit school) this was like an hour of heaven. (Laughs) My first  year, the principal came by and said,    What   s your name?    I said,     Jesse. Jesse Hummingbird.    He said,    How come you   re in the hall all  the time?    I said,    I   m a hall monitor.    He said,    No one   s hall monitor  for five periods, boy.    (Laughter)  8  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  How about your art experiences in high school?  That was another good experience. Actually, I had some of my work put  in competitions from other schools. I   m still going to an inner-city  school at this time, but the art supplies were better. We would compete  against the kids from Belmont area and stuff like that. They had oil  paints, and we had water colors and pastels. I think I won a couple  Honorable Mentions a couple years. You just kind of mounted it on a  piece of poster board, and it   d be shown at the local mall. They   d have a  little ribbon saying Honorable Mention. Those were good years. By then  I   d determined that I wasn   t going to be a bank president, or president of  anything, or chief or anything like that. I was going to be an artist. Why?  Because you could be odd, and it looked like an easy life at the time.  (Laughter)  When did you sell your first piece of art?  When did I sell my first piece of art? It might have been in Dallas. I was  doing Prismacolor drawings from the Dee Brown books and stuff like  that, real chiefs. I think I was selling them for fifteen to   they were all  under fifty dollars. It seemed like I sold a bunch of those then.  You were in your twenties then?  Yeah, I was still working full time.  I think the first school of higher education you went to was Watkins  Institute of Art and Design.  Well, now it   s a very   I just got some information from them this past  year. Now it   s a very prestigious school. At the time, it was downtown  Nashville, and it was a lot of genteel Southern women that were learning  to do still lifes. And at the time, it was an adult institution, but my  mother persuaded them to take this troubled kid in and give him  something to do on a Saturday. I started going there, and I think I went  two years, every Saturday, about fifteen, sixteen years old.  It sounds like your mom was supportive of your art.  Well, I was a pain in her butt forever, and so if she thought she could  encourage me, or if I was happy doing something and got out of her hair,  she was all for it.  So what prompted you to go on to Middle Tennessee State College?  I didn   t really want to go to college, but it was like,    Go be a teacher. Go  9  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  be a teacher.    Well, it lasted about nine to twelve weeks. I lost my  student deferments, so I automatically was eligible for the draft. That   s  how bad I wanted to get out of college. (Laughs)  So you went to Vietnam?  No. Lucky duck. I grew up in a trailer park in Nashville, and all these  guys had been to Vietnam once or twice Some of them that were  professional soldiers said,    Birdman, you don   t want to go to   Nam.  Birdman, you won   t live if you go to   Nam.    They said,    Wait and get  drafted.    Well, by 1970, which is whenever I hit eighteen, they went to  the lottery system. I had number 340 or 342, and nobody over fifteen  went. I   m one lucky duck. I   m proud of all my friends and family that  have been in the service, but I took it from my veterans in the  neighborhood that they knew what they was talking about.  How about University of Tennessee, because you took a couple of art  classes there?  Sandy   s got   art classes. I took all the art classes until they finally said,     This is an academic school, not an art school.    It was a nice school. It  was a branch of the University of Tennessee, nice instructors and  everything else. I really didn   t want to go to college, and I couldn   t  afford an art school. I finally was two classes from graduating, and  going to school at night, and working all day and everything. After   let  me see. How many years did it say? After four years, you kind of go,     Enough   s enough. What am I going to do with a degree?    Now I wish  I   d done it.  What kind of base do you feel like you got there for your professional  artist career?  Well, I learned the principles that I think all people, unless you   re just  savant, needs: design, 2D design, learned to sculpt a little bit. Learned  the fundamentals of oil painting and things like that, (of course, I   m not  an oil painter today) just a good, solid, basic art education. Being in  night school, I actually had one instructor in oil paints that had taught  Jamie Wyeth. He was a semi-professional artist, himself. He was a  professional drunk first, but that   s another story. Then had one Russian  immigrant, you know, whenever they let the first Jews out, who brought  a whole different perspective, that East European perspective on art. He  wasn   t one of these Russians I see in California that can copy old  masters. He was actually into Paul Klee type of stuff.  Chagall.  10  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Yeah, he didn   t buttonhook. I had friends that went to college full time  and got their BFA, and they painted exactly like their teachers, which is  not uncommon for art schools. At least going to night school, you never  had the same professor over and over that you fell into that trap. I didn   t  do printmaking. That was the only traditional art form I didn   t get into at  that time. I studied that later.  How would you describe your style and subject matter, then, right after  you got out of school?  Well, like I said, I was doing a pseudo-surrealism thing that I call  distortionist, like a Magritte type of thing, looking at mainstream art  magazines and things like that. Then, like I said, one day inspiration just  hit me, and I   ve been doing Indian art ever since. I started out doing pen  and ink, colored pencils, and then for the longest time now I   ve been  using acrylics.  How did you meet your wife, Sandy?  In Nashville, Tennessee I was still messing around with college a little  bit, but I decided I needed a vocation. I went to (what   s the name of it?)  Nashville Tech and studied graphic art. I learned the ins and outs of the  print business from binding to printmaking, collating to paste-up, and  design, stuff you don   t do today in the business. I took this job I got at  Peabody College, which is now part of Vanderbilt University, but at the  time it was a small private teachers college of Nashville. I got this job on  this federal grant money at this little college, and it turned out Sandy  was a road person for it. She went out and taught teachers seminars and  things like that. We finally started going to happy hour together. Don   t  do that if you   re young. We got to know each other, and eventually I  guess it was meant to be.  How did you first go about marketing your work?  I really didn   t know how when I became an Indian artist because it was  totally different. When I was a trying to become a regular artist, friends  of mine in Nashville, we would rent space and throw our own shows.  One time, The Tennessean did even give us an article on it, but we  barely sold anything. I still had to work for a living in those days. When  it came to Indian art, thank God, I was around a lot of nice people in  those days that kind of mentored me. Bill Rabbit was just hitting his  stride then, kind of took me under the wing. I don   t know. We probably  did too much drinking them days, but it seemed like you did a lot of  networking in bars. At least we convinced ourselves we did.  Between them old guys like him and some of the other folks, I just  11  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  started doing powwows. Next thing you know, you meet an art gallery  owner that someone has said,    You ought to look at this guy.       Oh,  yeah, he can do a show with us.    Then find out museums have  competitions. Today I do art markets. I do very little gallery business. I  got in the habit of being my own marketing person. Whenever I  introduce myself at a political thing or something, I say I   m a small  businessman because in my town everybody   s an artist.  So did your getting involved with Native art correspond to that period  when you were back in Oklahoma?  I started my Indian art full time when we left Dallas. We were only in  Dallas two years, and then we went to Tulsa. I got to look it up here real  quick. I don   t know when it was.  It was in the   80s.  Yeah, let me see. No, it was probably mid-  80s, yeah. Then I decided I   d  get on the powwow trail because that was about what my prices were. I  was kind of still trying to get my feet under me for doing Indian art, so I  was doing very traditional-looking things and trying to learn what my  contemporaries would be doing. I was on the powwow circuit probably  about two, two and a half years, even joined a club, the IICOT   Intertribal Indian Club of Tulsa  Club there in Tulsa. I used to be able to  drum and sing a little bit of Southern.  How did you figure out how to price your work when you started doing  the Native art circuit professionally?  I don   t know if I   ve even learned today. As old as I am, as long as I   ve  been doing it, I   m generally the cheapest guy at an art show. Some of  my friends really ask a lot of money for their work and get a lot of it, but  I kind of feel like everybody should be able to afford art, I guess. I do  have a print line, gicl  es, and my originals, but I   m pretty prolific. I   m  no Bill Rabbit, but I   m pretty prolific, so I don   t worry about pricing.  It   s probably by size. Living in Arizona is good because we have a year-round  art market close at hand, but we   ve been in a recession. I haven   t  raised my prices in probably eighteen months. I   ve got to, though. It  won   t be much, but I got to raise them.  What   s the best business tip you got from either another artist or maybe  a gallery owner or dealer?  Just to be upfront and honest with your buyer because if you have that  buyer, you should have a collector. A collector means they   re going to  buy more than one. Try to be as friendly as you can. People really want  12  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  you to be their friend, too. I mean, I see all types out there, but sitting  back, if you   re not selling your stuff, the guy next to you is selling.  They   re going to buy from the person that makes them happy or gives  them something to think about, that they know they can come back and  you   re going to be in business, and that price would be a good price  when they come back. That   s all I can say.  What was your first major award in Native painting, in Indian art?  I think it was at Agency Hill. I won the Graphics, I think. It was at that  time. I was doing pen and ink, and I think I won honorable mention  there once or twice before. This time I took a blue ribbon. It was a pen  and ink panel, about five little drawings matted out to be a long one.  Linda Greever who had the Art Market in Tulsa was always great about  letting artists come in. She   d work with you, or you could do it yourself.  You could do unusual things in those days. I did a good job matting it,  and I didn   t have to worry about the size because of Linda   s shop,  because she had that frame business, too. That was probably the first big  one I remember because now they have (well, they did then, too) the  Masters show. If I was going to live in Oklahoma, which at the time  looked like it was a possibility, then you might as well try to become a  Master there.  Then things started changing. All of a sudden people start asking to see  your Indian paper, and this is about the time I was leaving Oklahoma.  That certainly caused a big rift in the Indian community then because  we   d all been doing shows. I got my papers back in the   70s, and some  people   . Our Indian Cherokee community club had someone in the  other day, and there   s really nothing you can do for people whose folks  didn   t get on the Dawes Rolls. I had nothing to do with it, but for some  reason it caused such a rift. Like I said, I was moving out here at the  time. I   m glad I escaped from a lot of that.  Why did you decide to move to Arizona?  I always went where Sandy had work and she got a good job offer out  here. I don   t know. I   m one of those Okies that catches the wind and just  rolls along. Do you know that there   s two kinds of Okies? Ones that   ll  never leave Oklahoma, and the other one that wouldn   t mind getting on  a bus and trying someplace else. I   m that guy. (Laughter) I love  Oklahoma and my friends and family, but I love this desert and the  mountains.  Some artists have to experiment for a while before they find a style, but I  remember in the mid-  80s that you sort of had your style, I think, at that  point, when you were showing with Linda.  13  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Well, this lady came in from Indiana two winters ago and set up an  appointment, spent some time down in Bisbee at the house. Her husband  had collected almost fifty of my pieces, and it   s back when I was more a  traditional artist. I can see where I started changing then and moving  more into folk art style. From that point I went into this, I don   t know,  geometric movement thing, but I ran out of stories, and I felt I was in a  corner. Today I tell people to think of Peter Max meeting Grandma  Moses. (Laughter) Pop art is kind of where my head is, but I   m doing  this style because I want to tell stories. I want to start a Caddo story  when I get home, and I like to try to do complicated stories on one panel.  So far, the four or five I   ve done has been really a good way to go  commercially, but also intellectually satisfying. You sit in your studio,  and I do, day after day, even if I can only be in there an hour. I paint. I  paint. You get yourself going on these things, and sometimes you get in  a rut. You got to challenge yourself. I think at a certain age, too, (I   m in  my sixties now) you can   t be complacent just because you   ve been there,  done that, been there, done that because you find out when you get to  my age, the next important thing is the up-and-coming artist. An old  man   s got a stay on top of it. (Laughs)  Can you talk a little bit about the design elements in your work because  they seem to be a connective thread?  Well, people always said Aztec and Mayan, and I say,    Yeah, from the  Mounds.    Then at the same time, like I said, right now it   s just, you  know good design when you study art. No one   s that unique that you can  go out and create your own style, so don   t be afraid to borrow. Try to  camouflage it; try to make it your own. I think that   s been as successful  as it could. Now, my art, if you go online to my websites, you   ll see I cut  myself a very small piece of the Indian art pie. It   s not for everybody. I  have been lucky, and I have had my share of collectors.  What I like about your painting is that I think it has often a joyful  feeling. Are you conscious of working for that?  No. People say,    This will be great for a children   s room.    I think it   s a  backhanded compliment, but I think, yeah, that child still lives in all of  us unless you really had a horrible childhood. That   s all right with me. I  don   t want to put anybody down, but one reason I put off doing Indian  art, because it was always so sad, the end of the Trail or something like  that. In the beginning, I purposely didn   t want to do the melancholy. I  wanted to do the Indian humor side that all of us Indian folks know  about. Not enough, I don   t think, non-Indian folks know about. So, yeah,  I think I did it purposely, and there   s nothing wrong with it. A lot of my  14  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  work is romantic. People come up to   one time I was doing angels.  Someone said,    Indians don   t believe in angels.    I said,    What?      (Laughs) It   s like some people don   t think Indians believe in romance, I  think, too, holding hands, walking together and stuff. Come on, folks.  It   s the twenty-first century. (Laughter)  In 1996 you won the Indian Arts and Crafts Artist of the Year award.  What did that mean to you?  Well, like I said, Bill and Karen Rabbit were really strong mentors of  mine, and they talked me into going to   . IACA was a wholesale show.  At the time it was probably on its way down for the painters, but it was  still good. I got in there, and I got a handful of those ol    traders that  would support me and started wholesaling a lot of my stuff across the  country. That was when business was good. Bill had been Artist of the  Year.  This was when my style had changed again. I was really unsure, like my  heads were squares and stuff like that. I was really unsure of the style. I  did a romantic kind of American Gothic piece in my head, but my style,  and it won. They gave me fifteen hundred bucks, so I was pretty happy.  By the time I won, it didn   t mean what it used to mean. I am that guy,     You should   ve been here last year. You should   ve been at this show  last year.    I   m that guy that   s always the year behind, or two years  behind, but I was happy. Fifteen hundred bucks is fifteen hundred bucks,  I   m sorry. (Laughs)  You also around that time got a fellowship from SWAIA, the   Southwestern Association for Indian Arts  that works with Indian  Market, and you used it to study printmaking. Where did you study?  I lived in Cochise County, which is a southern-border county here in  Arizona. We have a good community college network down there, and  so for, like, fifty bucks a semester (and all supplies are given to you)  I went in and learned how to become an engraver, do monoprints. I did it  for a while, probably three years, but it just wasn   t for me because I  started out doing black and white. Monoprints, I guess it   s still hot, but it  was really hot back then. You sit there, and you paint up a plate. I  couldn   t get past my old brain,    Why don   t I go home and paint on a  piece of paper or canvas instead of doing all this other rigamarole stuff?     I fulfilled what I told SWAIA I was going to do. I know the ins and outs  of it, but I   d moved on. My nephew Travis Hummingbird got his MFA  from Tulsa University, and he   s a printmaker. I gave it to him, but so far  he hasn   t picked it up from my brother Eddie, and so we were looking.  There was a young Ryan Smith out there that was working with some  15  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Cherokee art education. He was supposed to pick it up and take it to  someplace where the students could use it, so I don   t know where my  press is. It   s in limbo. (Laughter.) If you   re interested, Eddie Morris in  Steely Hollow, if you need a printing press for students or something  like that, will be more than happy to donate it to you.  Speaking of Eddie, when he decided to get into sculpting professionally  on a full-time basis, did you guys have a few conversations, because you  had been doing the professional art thing for so long?  He was carving those wooden pieces he   s so well known for, and so he  had joined IACA. He was telling me about how he went one summer  and studied under Allan Houser, so it sounded like he was going to do it.  I kept thinking,    Well, geez, what   s he going on, a senior scholarship?     He   s not that much older than me, but he was probably reaching fifty by  then. I joke to him today about it. I think Eddie   s found his talent. He   s  been very successful at it and everything else. Like I said, he was one of  the smarties in the family because he went ahead and stayed at  something and got a retirement. He   s able to be more free, I think, in  some way than an old guy that has to make a living doing this.  You   ve done a lot commission art for posters. Are there challenges with  doing that kind of poster art?  Well, in the old days people would say,    Okay, we   re going to do that  piece for next year   s posters.    It seemed like the last eight to nine years,  they want to give you an idea, but the rule of thumb is, whenever I used  to get commission work when I started out, if someone wanted a darn  train and I don   t do trains, I wouldn   t try to do it. Now I say,    Okay, you  see my style. Now just tell me the elements you want in it. I   ll do a  drawing for you, and we   ll change the drawing. Then we   ll talk color.     That   s how the poster business seemed to have gone.  I just wound up doing a poster (well, it   s already done) for a show this  summer, small show up in Apache Country, and it was an old piece that  I already had. Overall, most people don   t do posters no more. I   m on the  advisory committee at a couple of shows, and if we   re going to do  anything at all, it   s going to be t-shirts. People just don   t want to spend  the money framing a darn poster no more, and it ain   t cheap, and  everybody wants a t-shirt.  You   ve done a number of illustrations for books. Can you talk a little bit  about the challenges of illustrating?  My wife and I have four or five activity books. She was probably the  most demanding person about illustrating for anybody. She wasn   t  16  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  horrible, you know, but just goes back to getting a good art education  and with my commercial art background, too. You learn these little  tricks doing thumbnails and seeing about the flow of it. That   s the  hardest part about being an illustrator is that it should all look like the  same person did it, and it should have a flow to it. That   s the hardest  thing in most people   s head, but it can be done. Like I said, you  storyboard it, thumbnail it, storyboard it, do a final drawing, and then  look at it one more time, making changes. Then paint the darn thing if  it   s going to be painted.  My two children   s books, this guy actually looked for a person to work  with for about six years, Gary did, Gary Robinson. Finally at this  museum show in LA, one of the ladies at the show said,    Have you  talked to Jesse Hummingbird?    He said,    No, should I?    She said,    Go  talk to Jesse Hummingbird.    We had a brief lunch, and I said,    Here   s  the way I work. The problem is, the reason I won   t work with many  people is because you already have an idea of what you want and you   re  not going to be flexible.    He says,    No, I don   t. Maybe I would have  done that six years ago, but I want these things done.    I said,    It   s not  that I don   t want your input. I want you to be happy, but let me run with  it.     It   s talking about our  Native American  Night Before Christmas. They  said in the Santa Fean paper that it was the 800th version of the Night  Before Christmas that has really been published. He talks about tipis,  and I   m thinking of putting satellite dishes on them and TVs inside of  them and things like that, and the daddy wearing bunny slippers. He  said,    Just draw it out, and we   ll go from there.    It was a really fun  project, and we had a publisher lined up. Don   t do nothing unless you  got a publisher lined up. That   s the first rule for me. It got washed away  in Katrina, so it took us another five years to find a publisher. Gary   s a  filmmaker, also. He did these DVD versions, and the Indian PBS version  up in Nebraska picked them up and distributed it for him. They were  shown on PBS channels at Christmastime, like, three years ago. We  were very fortunate about that. If you   re going to be a full-time artist, try  not to say no every time someone brings an idea to you. Try to be  flexible, but don   t use your own money. That   s the secret. You spend  thousands and get back dollars. Okay.  You did a solo show called Oklazona in 2009 at the Sharlot Hall  Museum in Prescott, Arizona. Can you describe your goals for that show  and its title?  Well, you can   t call someone an Okie unless you   ve been born there.  Otherwise it   s an insult. This part of the world in San Diego and the  beaches in California, they call us    zonies    as a put down. I wanted to  17  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  call it Okiezonies, but they wouldn   t let me do that. I know they   re head  archaeologist and stuff over there, really good, Sandy Lynch, and she  had an idea to get five contemporary artists, Indian artists, to do  something called Beyond the Rawhide Ceiling or something like that.  I was going to be first because she figured I could get my act together.  (Like I said, I   m prolific. We could theme it if we wanted to, and I said,     No, I don   t want to theme it.   ) Then this lady friend of mine, Judith  Durr, she does these real traditional still lifes with Indian blankets and  pots and moccasins and things like that; then a real well-known Hopi  artist that   s dead now, Paul Kabotie, was going to be either next to last  or last; and Baje Whitethorne who is a pretty well-known contemporary  Navajo painter.  We did lose Kabotie, but we pulled it off. We was hoping that we could  get a Ford Foundation or something, maybe travel it, but we couldn   t. It  was the beginning of the recession, but it was a successful show. We  could sell, which is unusual for most museums. I think I sold three or  four on opening, and I think I ended up selling all but one. I did a series  of Booger paintings if you Cherokees knows what boogers are. I was  one of the first ones to start doing them again, not to be blowing my own  horn. They are tough ones to sell, but I love doing my Boogers. I think I  still got the Booger that I put in that show.  What is your most important booth show these days?  Well for me, Indian Market   s not a good show for painters. I put Santa  Fe in the top five all the time. The Heard   s always been a good market  for me. It   s the consistency. Like I was supposed to have been on the  waiting list this year, but I got in. The not knowing of getting in some of  these other shows   . I do this small show up in the Denver area, the  Tesoro Foundation at Morrison, and it   s always in the top three shows.  Sharlot Hall is up and down like a roller coaster. I   m on their advisory  board, and we have a small group of Indian artists there, less than ninety.  The majority of us, we feel like it   s like a little homecoming when we   re  there that weekend. It generally monsoons one day. The adversity brings  us together, too. I do my last show in December up at Pueblo Grande,  and I   ve helped them out through the years on advisory   . I don   t know.  It   s one of those shows that   s never been a great selling show. I have a  buddy up there that works with somebody on the East Coast, and he   ll  bail me out if it   s a real slow show and gives me cash. I think I do  several shows just out of habit.  You don   t do a lot Oklahoma shows, though. Why is that?  Last time I drove to Oklahoma, it was right at fourteen hours to  18  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Oklahoma City, (Laughs) and not the prettiest drive in the world, either,  even though I try to make it pretty. Down here in the south, I got to take   Interstate  10 over to Las Cruces, go up to Ruidoso, and then I can  come across and come up underneath Amarillo. Once you hit that other  side of where Peter Hurd lived, there in San Patricio Valley, it   s pretty  ugly until you get up in Oklahoma again.  You painted an electric guitar for the Hard Rock Caf   Casino in  Catoosa. What did you enjoy about that?  Well, I have a buddy in Bisbee. He   s a guitar guy. He came over and  took it all apart for me so I could just really wail on the painting of it.  It   s the first thing and the last thing I ever did for the Nation, so I wanted  to play it safe. I called Anna Mitchell (at the time, she was still alive)  to make sure I was doing the right Eagle Dancers. I tried to do an old-school  Eagle Dancer on the front and back of it. Right whenever you go  into the Sweet Potato, Wild Potato, whatever it is, the buffet there, it   s  right in your vision whenever you go in, unless they moved it. It was a  challenge, and it was nice little payday. It had never been out of the box,  so that was cool. I had to sand it off and everything else, and some of the  other guys did some interesting things. It was probably one of the last  things that Bill Rabbit and I participated together with because I think  he   s got one in there.  I had done another instrument. I was up at the Tesoro Foundation in  Morrison, and this woman come up and said,    You   re Jesse  Hummingbird.    I said,    Yes ma   am.    She said,    I   m with the Children   s  Youth Orchestra here in town. For years we   ve been getting old violins,  and artists    hands for them to paint, and then we would auction them off  for a fundraiser.    I did that, but that fiddle probably hadn   t seen a good  day in a long time. It was in bad shape. I did this old myth that I created  called Buffalo Girl I came up  with  for all the strong women. I wanted  to reward them for influencing my life. I do this character, Buffalo Girl,  and she   s on the front. She   s always teasing this guy called Red Pony  Boy, and he   s on the back. (Laughter) It   s a sky thing. It   s very pop-arty.  They sold it, and I was first Indian artist to do that because I beat my  Navajo friend by a week. (Laughter)  What are the advantages or disadvantages of being a Cherokee artist in  Arizona?  Well, the amazing thing of it is, is that whenever I moved out here, I had  to get used to everybody out here conversing into their own language  and not being upset about it, but they really have treated me no different.  My Navajo friends, I   ve been around so long that they   ll say,     Y  '  t'    h,    and start talking to me. My friend, Evelyn will say,    Yata  19  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  what?    (Laughter) I never been treated as an outsider by my peers out  here.  I   ve seen a lot of these folks; it   s like if I stayed in Oklahoma. Kids grow  up, become adults, themself. One friend of mine is from Oklahoma, too.  He   s a Seminole and Yuchi or whatever it is. When his daughter was  small (this was before we all started getting our tents) I was  demonstrating. I was still drinking beer, and I was just sweating like a  pig. She went over to Randy and said,    Daddy, Daddy, you know your  friend?    He said,    What friend?       Your fat friend. He   s over there  melting. Can I take him a umbrella?    (Laughs) Now she   s pushing  thirty. (Laughter)  What project are you working on that you   re currently excited about?  I really have no outside projects at this time. I   m just finished up two  commission works, and I got two more I   ve got to get done. Right now,  I   m just working on inventory, and I   m working on this Caddo story  about Thunder Boy and Lightning. I got to see if I can get this drawing  done, that it makes sense to me, and then ask someone like my wife,    If  I tell you this story, can you see it in this painting?    Then from there, go  on. It   s really a long one, so I   m going to have to edit it down. Right  now, like I said, those are the challenges. If you   re in the studio every  day and you don   t have to worry about thinking of stuff, good for you,  but I really got to bend myself every now and then or I don   t enjoy it,  and I love what I do.  Let   s talk a little bit about your artistic process and techniques. Your  primary medium is acrylic on canvas. What other materials do you work  on? Do you work on Masonite sometimes?  I have, but I don   t, as a rule. I use Masonite for oversized projects. A  friend of mine for years has been painting on the non-slick side. It   s kind  of cool. You get this really nice texture, and the paint really works better  on it for me. As a rule, only for special projects like that. This lady  wanted me to paint a mural for a bathroom, and I talked her into,    Well,  if you move, you can take these with.    Two full solid sheets of  Masonite. I told her,    I   m a fat man. I can   t stand in your bathtub all day  and paint.     I was wondering if you had done any mural work.  That was this close. I always thought I wanted to try it. I had a friend,  when he was in good health he lived up in Washington State. There   s  some place in Idaho that the town   s full of murals. He was working on  one, and he said,    Come up. I   ll pay you.    I never did get a chance to do  20  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  it because it   s got a whole different thing going on, mops and brooms  and everything else. It sounded like it would be fun. I mean, hard work,  but fun.  You don   t ever work in oils at all, but do you work in pencil sometimes?  Yesterday I did a drawing. I finished a painting and the process of  varnishing it. I didn   t want to start on this Caddo piece until I can spend  about a whole day with it, so I did a quick pencil drawing yesterday. I  don   t draw as much as I think I want to do it because I really do keep  banker   s hours.  So you don   t really do preliminary sketching for your     Oh, no. I do cartoons as the old Renaissance artists. I grid my paper, and  about once every five years I go to the newspaper company and buy a  leftover roll of newspaper and get it to size. I hate working on a piece,  and you think you   re doing great. Then you get back from it, and the  person looks like they   re falling over. That   s the only reason I do my  preliminary because, I don   t know, it just goes back to that traditional  training I guess.  How have your colors changed over the years?  I have a piece in my dining room that when I was in Tulsa, either my  varnish had gotten frozen and thawed out, or   . The paint started  crawling, so I never did sell it. It   s more my traditional work. I just was  afraid that one of these days the paint would fall off of it. It never has. It  never has done any more than what it originally did. Two pieces I did for  myself kind of, they   re hanging in the hallway. I look at my work today,  and all I can say is that this part of Arizona must be like the south of  France because my palette is so much more brighter and intense. Instead  of south of France, this is southeast Arizona. I use liquid acrylics now  almost exclusively instead of tubes. Tubes aren   t as bright.  You mentioned that you did get a background in sculpture a little bit. Do  you ever experiment with sculpture?  No. No, it   s one of those deals I keep thinking,    I   m going to do it. I   m  going to do it.    It   s Eddie   s territory right now. More power to him  because it   s not an easy life. He   s suffering a little bit from carpal tunnel.  I helped him load up a couple of those three five-hundred-pound ones. It  has its attractions, good money and everything else, but, dang, that   s  working. (Laughter)  Can you talk about your approach to specifically Cherokee subject  21  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  matter when you do that? Is it a very big vein of your work?  It   s about 25 percent of my work. The piece, I guess, you   ll put on film  later is The Stomp Dance piece. I have favorite subjects. I love my Eagle  Dancers, just love them for me personally to do them. I love Stomp  Dance pieces. The last one that I was really thrilled about, I just sold a  Cherokee legend piece the other day, like one of those more complicated  ones I was telling you about. I don   t try to have too many Cherokee  pieces at once because people out here tend to know Southwest. It   s like  if I was to paint tipis. Right now, I   m always looking for good stories.  There   s a couple of Cherokee stories I just I haven   t figured out in my  head yet, the Rose and a couple of other things that I want to do and  probably get done this year before it   s over.  Well, you mentioned a couple of your favorite subjects to paint. We  might have covered that.  Right now it   s   I keep sketch books around, but I   m finding I   m using  them less and less, and have for the last three or four years. I tend to get  an idea where I   m finishing the last piece I did, unless it   s a story I got to  research on. I tend to do spontaneous things. I am laying off right now a  series I   ve been doing of old cars done Jesse Hummingbird style with  kind of contemporary Indians on a pseudo-Route 66. It   s been very  successful. I went to the Black Hills last year and did two motorcycles  pieces. Just sold the last one the other day, and that   ll probably be last  motorcycles I do for a while unless it   s commission. I   m letting my car  pieces rest right now and doing these, I hope, more Indian stories. I do a  lot of these music pieces. The things I like about working on music is  that I try to find some titles I like, so, boom, right there. If I don   t have  an image, then I go and find another one until I start getting these  images. It   s like shorthand; it   s an easy way to be creative. That   s been a  good series. A lot of those end up being romantical pieces.  Well, picking up the idea of story again, what do you think is so  important about story in painting?  I don   t know if it works in other   . I think minorities are expected to  have good stories. I think Indian folks especially are expected to have  good stories. I mean, look, we got storyteller competitions, so I think it  goes hand in hand with being Native.  What   s your process for coming up with titles?  Well, (Laughs) I did a Bill Rabbit the other day: I had two paintings in a  booth with the same title on it. (Laughter) You can see there is a  problem. Sandy says,    That   s a good paragraph. Now what are we going  22  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  to call it?    I think it   s my titles. Sandy is considered the CEO, the CFO,  and everything else in the marketing management, so we do have these  meetings, business meetings, and sometimes it is about titles. I don   t  know. It   s something that   s just horrible. (Laughter)  What kinds of research do you do? Say, you   re going to tackle a specific  story. What kinds of research do you do?  Well, I try to find old stories, something that   s in the public domain,  number one. Contemporary stories I won   t touch because the author  might get persnickety. I understand intellectual property; no problem  about that. I try to find the older ones, and I do research them that way. I  used to do a lot more research on different cultures    clothing, and then I  find myself now just doing my own generic style of clothing. We all  know what a ribbon shirt is, what this is, what that is. I   m not a historical  artist. I don   t worry and lose sleep over that. I don   t read Indian  materials that much. I got a whole library of them, and it   s something I  promised I   d do when I got older. There   s just not enough time.  Can you describe your creative process from the time that you, like, get  an idea?  Well, like I said, I used to keep drawing, and I still out of habit draw on  tablets. I like the spiral notebooks. It wouldn   t make any sense to  anybody else if they saw my drawings because they   re not really  drawings. They   re just pieces of lines and stuff. Then I would go back  and look at that six months later. Knock on wood, I   ve been blessed with  a great imagination. My work overall, unless it   s something that   s been  pestering me, is pretty spontaneity. It   s getting it down to a drawing, and  then seeing if I can put it to a size I want.  What is your creative routine? I think you   ve kind of talked about it. You  paint during the day as opposed to night.  Yeah, most of my friends that I know are night painters. Turns out it   s  because they had kids. They painted at night when the kids were asleep.  Me, I keep banker   s hours. I get up early. I got my room blacked out  because, if not, you get up so dang early out here with this sun. I get up,  I   m up and usually walking the dogs, Sandy and I, about seven, have  breakfast, and work out three days a week. Then get caught up on the  family chores the other days that I   m not doing that. Then in the studio  by eight thirty, nine o   clock and working until five, five thirty.  If you   re going to be a full-time artist, don   t fool yourself in thinking  that because no one   s there to say,    You got to clock in, do this, and do  that.    You got to make a schedule, and you got to get into that schedule  23  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  and stay with it because too many things can come up.    Oh, meet me  down at the caf  .    Well, you don   t get home until ten, eleven o   clock.  Then someone says,    Let   s go have a beer.    Well, you didn   t get nothing  done all day. You got to approach it as a business because you   re not  going to make it, unless you   re an Osage or a casino Indian. You got to  work. It   s work. It   s good work, but it is work. Nothing   s wrong with a  routine.  How about your signature? Sometimes it   s a little bit of an art, where  you place it and how you decide you want to handle it.  I try to put it all the time in the same place on the canvas, although I had  to put it sidewards a couple of times. It   s either a circle-c Hummingbird  or    JTH   . Those are the only signatures I got unless it   s a print. Then I  scribble my    Jesse T. Hummingbird    on it. My brother Ed said,    It looks  like you   re signing, (because they always called my dad JT) and I said,     I think I   m doing it subliminally to honor him.    It   s supposed to be  Jesse T. There was a movement there for a while in the   70s when I was  in Oklahoma of putting your Indian name and your fetish and everything  else. When we had a miniature show, one guy from Muskogee   s name  was almost the whole image by the time he got it all on there, (Laughter)  so keep it simple.  Looking back on your career so far, what   s been a pivotal moment when  you came to your fork in a road, and you went one way as opposed to  another?  I got into art because what I was doing making a living was going  through a change. Technology was changing it, and I kind of got myself  to a point that there was no turning back from being an artist. I always  thought,    I could go back to digging ditches,    but realistically, no, I  can   t, physically. I never tried to figure out what I   m doing, so I   ve  never really come to that fork in the road. I don   t know whether that   s a  good thing or a bad thing. That   s the only way I know how to answer  that, I think. (Laughs)  What would you say has been one of the high points of your career?  I think, looking back at it all, it   s the community, the community of  artists and not being too bullheaded to listen. I met some incredible  people. I got some incredible people that support me, I stay with  sometimes, and things like that, people I never would have met staying  in a print shop or something else like that. It   s truly been a blessing.  Sometimes you forget that when you drink or do other bad things. I   ve  seen several friends ruin their careers because of bad things.  24  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  It   s just really been a blessing. I think it   s all been good. There   s been  times when I haven   t sold a darn thing, and there   s been times whenever  I thought,    Why did I go there?    There   s been times when I wouldn   t  talk to a friend for a month because he told me to go do a show and I  shouldn   t have, but overall, it   s been the community all around. It   s just  been a blessing, like I said.  People shouldn   t do this unless they feel like they   re blessed. It   s not  given that you   re going to be wealthy or anything else. It   s like an artist  told me one time,    Be thankful if it gives you everything you need  because you   re always going to want something more, but be thankful if  it gives you what you need.    That   s how I   ve lived. I   ve not made a lot  of money doing it, but I made my share of living. Sandy   s had to do her  share, for sure, sometimes a little bit more than mine.  What has been one of the low points?  Well, you know, the lowest point is getting to be this old. It hurt when  we was young and we lost a friend. Now old age is getting a lot of us.  Bad things happened to them in Vietnam, or they got diabetes or  something. It   s seeing your contemporaries go by the way, I think.  That   s the low point. I had one friend, he   s a little bit younger than I am,  a Hopi artist, promising career. Had a stroke and lost that side of his  body. Someone said he   s painting again, but I haven   t seen him in a  while. I hope so. Those are the low and the crushing parts. Knock on  wood, not many of us road warriors have perished on the road, but I  worry about that all the time. I   m on death row out here on I-10 all the  time.  Is there anything else you   d like to add before we take a look at your  artwork?  Well, I certainly appreciate the opportunity to do this. I   ll always think  of myself as an Okie. Who knows. I might end up there one day again. I  hope I said something in there that maybe can influence someone to  make the right decision. You   re not always going to do the right thing,  but if you don   t learn from doing it wrong, then you   re in trouble. Like I  said, you got to be friendly, be honest, and be sincere in your artwork.  Even my goofy stuff, it has an honest sincerity about it. Thankfully,  people have bought it through the years and some of these collections  have ended up in some very prestigious museums, which I   m honored  about. Be sincere, honest, and enjoy. Be dedicated. Oh, and be humble.  Nothing worse than an Indian that ain   t humble.  Okay, we   re going to take a break and look at this artwork. Jesse would  you like to tell us about this painting, maybe the title and anything like  25  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  that?  It   s a Stomp Dance piece. The leaders are just starting out, and of  course, they   re going around the fire that   s never gone out since we were  given it. The smoke is turning into the Phoenix, and everybody says,     What   s with the spider?    Well, Grandma Spider, the little water  spider   s the one that brought us the fire to start the big fire. The Stomp  Dance is mainly religious. They sing prayers, and then it livens up a  little bit, and it   s done in different phases of the moon. The one I used to  go to was always the full moon. Like I said, I like doing Stomp Dance  pieces. The women   s got on their turtle shells, shakers, and everything  else, and I do some liberty to it. Old Cherokees say you ain   t supposed  to do it exactly right, anyway. So that   s that. I have to look on the back. I  never remember my titles. Grandmother Spider, Phoenix.  Okay, great. Jesse, can you tell us about this piece, which is one of your  older pieces, actually?  Well, it   s the oldest style. I   m still repeating the shapes, but the faces  have changed through the years. I call them Booger masks even though  they   re not a representation of a Booger mask. Why we call Booger  masks    Booger masks   , I don   t know because we are really saying  mask, mask. That   s the way I learned to say it. But it is a little Booger.  I   ve been doing these for thirty-something years now. At one point I  thought I   d do nothing but a whole booth of them, they were so popular.  The parrot feathers, they don   t always have parrot feathers on them, but  the parrot feathers come from people that come to my booth and say,     Oh, do you want parrot feathers?    So I know their names. Should be a  name on the back of this one. I always put on the back how I make them,  and what that parrot   s name is and everything else. Yes, that   s been a  nice little honey piece for me, I tell you. I was fortunate, whatever  reason I came up with it.  I love them, and that   s just a little bit of horse hair, looks like.  Yeah. Then the matting I get done in Farmington, New Mexico. A  person I ran across a long time ago got into the computer mat cutting  business. I send him designs, and he sends me back my mat, so I   ve been  real fortunate in that sense.  That   s great. Okay, can you tell us about this illustration?  Like I was saying in the interview earlier, that Gary gave me a lot of  freedom. I actually didn   t know what chokecherries were, and him and  Sandy got me up to speed on those. I   m showing my age on this one.  Whenever I was a kid, on TV on the Texaco hour, Milton Berle, they  26  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  Little Thunder  Hummingbird  always had these dancing legs. They had cigarettes or something on  them, and all you see is these ladies    legs. I kind of stole that, but there   s  CD players, and cats, and dogs. They   re on the floor of a tipi, you got to  remember. I had a lot of fun doing this one. It really was.  How about this illustration?  You can see the satellite dish, the Christmas lights. He   s run out; he  heard something. He   s got a spoon, but if you look at his night slippers,  they   re bunny slippers. Once again I got to have all kinds of fun with  this. My dad actually made us a tipi when we was in South Carolina.  Went and got some bamboo poles, and my mother sewed together all  these old jean legs. That   s my experience. Then I got a buddy called Tipi  Rex. Had all the shows out here for his tipi. Generally, Rex is the one  that puts it up. It certainly is interesting to watch one guy put up a tipi.  Oh my goodness.  Yes.  Well, thank you so much for your time today, Jesse.  Oh, no problem.  -------  -------
