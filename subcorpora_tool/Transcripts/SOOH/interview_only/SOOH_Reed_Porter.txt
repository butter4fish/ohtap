 Larson and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is September 3, 2009 and I   m at the Muskogee Public  Library in Muskogee, Oklahoma interviewing Mr. Porter Reed. This  interview is being conducted as part of the Muskogee African American  Heritage Oral History Project which is part of the Spotlighting  Oklahoma series. Thank you so much, Mr. Reed, for joining us today. I  was wondering if you could start out by telling us a little bit about when  and where you were born.  Well my name is Porter Reed. I was born in Windham, Texas in the  northeast part of Texas. My mother and father were sharecroppers. All  of her people, and my father   s people, had moved to Oklahoma. So our  family was the last family to leave Texas and come to Oklahoma. We  came to Oklahoma in 1927. We all, fortunately, lived in Taft, Oklahoma.  That   s where we relocated. We come on the Katy train. Got off at the  Katy Station right up here on Broadway  in Muskogee, Oklahoma .  Moved out to Taft that night. They  grandparents  picked us up and we  moved out to Taft that night. That was in 1927. That   s where all my  mother   s people were. Her brothers and sisters, every one of them was  out there at Taft. My grandfather had a big farm out there. And right  across, about a mile, from his house was a school they called Sugar  Creek. He lived about two miles west of Taft on a farm and about a mile  north of him was a school called Sugar Creek, on the highway. That was  my first school. I attended Sugar Creek School in 1927.  So that would have been when you were starting kindergarten?  We didn   t have kindergarten. We had just a school.  Okay, just school.  Just school out there. The principal was Scott and they had two teachers.  5  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  And so my daddy moved to Muskogee and started working in  Muskogee. He went to work in the convention hall in 1928, in a barber  shop cutting hair. A shave was a nickel and a hair cut was a dime. He  was making twenty-five cents on the dollar. So in    29 he brought us to  Muskogee. Moved the family to Muskogee. On Fremont   613 Fremont,  we moved to Muskogee. I attended Douglass Grade School in 1929 and  graduated from Douglass Grade School and went to Manual Training  High School in 1936.  I had two brothers and one sister. There were four of us, two brothers  and a sister. My oldest brother was Alonzo and my youngest brother was  Cornelius. My sister was named Ivy Jo. We all went to Manual Training  High School and we all graduated from Manual Training High School.  In 1942 I was inducted into the United States Army. I played football for  Manual Training High School in    39,    40,    41, and    42. We won the state  championship in 1940 and    41.  Who was the coach at that time?  W.W. Coxwell was the coach at Manual Training High school. We had a  championship team in    40 and    41. And out of that team, there   s not but  two of us left living. Dr. Harold Tollett, a former dentist, and myself. No  one else is living off that 1940 and 1941 football team. All the rest have  passed away. So after that I went into the United States Army in 1942,  went overseas. But in the meantime I started playing baseball in 1937.  So that was something you did in high school too?  Yes, I played in high school. I happened to be a pretty good baseball  player during that time. We   d play sandlot baseball on the Douglass  school ground in the old Athletic Park and I was with grown men  playing baseball. We had some real good negro baseball players here in  Muskogee. About ten of them went into the Negro League, out of  Muskogee. Our great star in Muskogee was Lafayette Dumas. We called  him Fate Dumas. He was really in a class with Satchel Paige. And we  had Henry Williams, our catcher, stayed on north Third Street. He was  originally in the class of Josh Gibson. Lloyd Bruce, the pitcher, and just  quite a few ball players here in Muskogee was real good. They played in  the Negro League.  I played baseball with and against Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, Roy  Campanella. I was in the same league they were in. I played with them  and against them. And when the Kansas City Monarchs would come to  Muskogee, I would play with them. When I got in the League I played  against them. Memphis Red Sox, Birmingham Black Barons,  Indianapolis Clowns, Philadelphia Stars, Newark Eagles, New York  6  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Black Yankees, New York Cubans, Atlanta Black Crackers. I played in  the Negro League and I played Detroit Wolves and everything.  When I was overseas in Saipan, in the forties      43,    44,    45, I was one  of the top ball players in Saipan. And I ran track. I was one of the top  ball players. I got home in 1946 and I went to Canada and played with  the Los Angeles Lincoln All-Stars. I played with the Detroit Wolves and  I played with the Newark Eagles, which they moved to Houston, Texas  with Larry Doby, Don Newcombe, Monte Irvin and all those ball players  that were on that ball club. I was on that ball club and I played with  them. They moved to Houston. I played with them in Houston, Texas  and everything. So I quit playing baseball in 1950. I didn   t quit, I just  got out of the Negro League in 1950 and came back to Muskogee. I  came back to Muskogee and I played with the semi pro team here in  Muskogee. Until my eyes went bad and everything I was a painter and a  roofer. I painted and roofed houses. I retired from work in 1986 on  account of my eye sight and everything. But I   m 87 years old, still got  my full head of hair, still walk, have my right mind. I   m a member of the  Roy Chapel African American Episcopal church. I   m a trustee, usher,  and adult Sunday school teacher. I enjoy church, enjoy all the people  around here. Now on North Second street   I   ll get back to the history of  Muskogee.  Can we go back to high school real quickly?  Yes, ma   am.  Just because I think we want to cover a few things there, if that   s okay.  Go right ahead.  When you were in high school and playing baseball, we know who your  football coach was, who was your baseball coach?  The same.  Same coach?  In my day, baseball wasn   t popular in high school. You could play with  the big boys.  So you were more playing, as you said, sort of the sandlot games?  Yeah, see the big thing in Muskogee was football. They did have a  baseball team, and I played with them but it wasn   t as popular as  football in high school.  7  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  What position did you play?  I was an outfielder, center field. And I had about a speed about ten flat if  I was in top condition. May get down to ten, every now and then I   d hit  nine-nine. But ten flat was my   around ten, I stayed around ten. But I  was a good baseball player for speed. Good outfielder. Knew the game  real well. If you knew the game real well back then, see it   s not like it is  now. Now they have minor leagues and they train you to come up. Well  we didn   t have that. If you were good enough to play on a team, you  played. Otherwise you didn   t play. You had to do something else. I  wasn   t a top home run hitter. I didn   t hit home runs like Josh Gibson and  all those big   Willard Brown and all those big home run hitters. Neil  Sutter, Dick See and Oscar Charleston. One of the greatest baseball  players that ever lived, black or white, was Oscar Charleston. A negro,  Oscar Charleston. And great men like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson,  Monte Irvin, Larry Doby, Willie Wells, Terris McDuffie, Felton Snow,   Frazier     Slow    Robinson, Dick See, Neil Sutter   just so many good  negro baseball players.  During that time, and when they took Jackie   in 1946 America National  League had a game and they played in St. Louis. The National League  played the American League. They had an all-star game and there was  about thirty-some-odd-thousand people there. And the negros played in  Chicago, Comiskey Park. East and West game, we called it. They had  55,000. And right here in Muskogee the Muskogee Reds played the  Muskogee Giants. Class C semi pro team in the Western Association,  they   d have 300 and 400 people at the game. And when the Kansas City  Monarchs come to town, the Memphis Red Sox, the Indianapolis  Clowns, the Baltimore Elite Giants, the Black Barons would come to  town, they   d have 2,000 and 3,000 people at the game.  Where did those games used to be held?  At Athletic Park where the Civic Center is now. That   s where they  played the football and the baseball. That spot right where the Civic  Center is.  And were there stands there or did people just come out?  It was a grand stand. It was a nice baseball park. Really, really nice and  everything. It   d seat around 4,000. Good baseball playing. Good  bleachers and everything.  What year was that starting to be really popular, do you remember?  After World War I, baseball was popular. After World War I up until  8  Jackie Robinson went into baseball, negroes dominated baseball. They  were the thing, then. And after the season was over with, they   d have an  all star team. Bob Feller would have one and they   d play against the  negroes and the negroes came out ahead. So this is one thing that people  knew. Jackie Robinson attended school at UCLA, went to school with  the white boys, graduated in    39. Well after negroes started making all  that money in baseball, Branch Rickey had an idea. See we weren   t  allowed to play baseball with whites. Negroes was segregated. Every  now and then they   d play against you but you could come in. So he  chose Jackie Robinson because he was educated and went to a white  school and played with the white boys.  Now Jackie wasn   t the best baseball player when he chose him. But he  did turn out to be. That   s cause of good scouts, they chose the right man  and everything worked out. But he had a lot of problems. He couldn   t  sleep in the hotel with the guys, they put black cats on the field, would  call you a nigger. But that   s all right. That   s life. See, there   s a lot of  things that people don   t understand. If you go to church, read your Bible,  read the history, people are going to be segregated. They   re going to be  in certain classes, they   re going to be called everything. See, even if  somebody called me a nigger it don   t make me no different because I  know better, it all pales away. But they crucified Christ. They killed  him. He was a good man  So I   m no better than anybody else.  When I played baseball against, I   d go down in Arkansas and play   my  name is Porter Reed. That   s my name. But I wasn   t Porter Reed when I  went to Arkansas. I was nigger. But it didn   t make no difference. I was  down there making good money. We made good money in Arkansas.  We had some hard times, some days we didn   t make nothing and some  days we made good money. But guys now days are making millions.  Millions and millions of dollars.  We left here one day on our way to Canada in rain and rain and rain and  rain all the way up there, and we liked to have starved to death. We ate  bologna and crackers. Sleeping on the bus. But life, it   s not rosy. A lot  of guys had a hard time. Some have a hard time now. Some have good  times and everything. But I want to tell you one thing that I don   t  believe. This case about the steroid, I don      t think a pill will make you hit  a home run. I don   t think a pill will, but if you don   t have good eyes and  everything.  Satchel Paige came along too soon. He was born too soon. He   d throw  about a ninety-nine miles per hour fastball. He could get up around 110  just like he wanted, he had good control. He could intentionally walk  somebody. That   s an insult to Satchel. You couldn   t not answer, not to  Satchel Paige. And all you had to do to Satchel Paige, instead of talking,  9  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  he would hit it. Now he was a wise man, money wise. He would hop  teams. He would follow the money. He made good money then, back  when other people weren   t making any, he was making good money out  of it because he knew what to do.  How were you guys paid when you were playing for the teams? Did you  have a salary?  When you   re in the Negro League, you get paid per game, but some  teams paid you every day.  So it depended how much they got, how many tickets they sold?  Yeah and they give you seven dollars a day, that   s for eating and  sleeping. A room wouldn   t cost you but a dollar, maybe two. And you  had five dollars to eat on three meals. Meals weren   t high either. You  could get a breakfast for thirty-five cents and dinner for fifty or forty-five  cents. That   s all. And back then, bread was two loaves for a nickel  and a bottle of milk was a dime for a quart. So things were different.  Everything   s high but I   m in good shape, still in good shape. Never  drank and never smoked. Go all over town walking. People see me  walking. That   s Porter Reed, you see me walking around here. I   m the  only   there   s one more fellow staying up in Clearview, Oklahoma. He  and I are the only former Negro League baseball players that   s living in  Oklahoma. All the rest of them passed away. There   s quite a few but  they all passed away. A guy named Eugene Golden lives in Clearview,  Oklahoma; he   s eighty-five. He was a pitcher. He played with the  Cleveland Buckeyes. A left handed pitcher, played for the Cleveland  Buckeyes. He is still in Clearview, Oklahoma. I visit him and we talk  every now and then. He played with Jackie Robinson and Lou Kesten  and Satchel Paige and all those fellows. He   s an old Negro League  baseball player. There   s very few of us left living. And they made a lot  of promises to us about pension and everything. He   s trying to get  around to it. But they did, when they took Jackie Robinson, he was  successful, that was the end of Negro Baseball League. They started  bringing them all in. Sifting us and just cut us out.  When did you start playing professionally?  I started in    37, but I was     So that was when you were still in high school? You were playing in the  summer?  Yeah, see when the Kansas City Monarchs and those teams come to  town, I was right up there bat boying, run out there and catch balls and  10  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  everything. Now the man who taught me how to play baseball, how to  catch a baseball, his name was Dick Bonner. Do you know Muriel  Saunders?  No.  She   s on the Board of Education here. Her father would stand on Sixth  Street and hit fly balls on Seventh Street. He was a big man, weighed  about 260, and if we caught a ball he   d give us a nickel. That   s how I  learned how to catch a ball. That was back in    34 and    35. Now in 1937,  this is really important. In 1937, 19th of June on the south end they were  having a big celebration, 18th-19th of June and it was during the election.  And they had free barbeque, free beer, free pop and everything. And the  young men, I would play with the young boys. We played first that  morning and the old men played that evening. Well, the old men went  out there   half of them were drunk. They were drinking that free  whiskey and free home brew and everything. Well, they were short one  player and they asked me to play with them. I did so good with the small  boys, I had my chest stuck out. And he went to my father. I stayed right  across the street from the park. My father told me to go play with them. I  said no. He said,    Would you       and I said no. And he pulled off his  belt. It was around 2,000 people there at this big picnic. Police was  there. All those people were there, on south Seventh Street and  Southside Boulevard. And I started running from my father. He was  thirty-seven years old. He was born in 1900. Instead of me going home I  went out across the baseball field. He caught me around second base, my  father did. I thought I could out run him.  You thought you could run.  My father caught me, got me down, put his foot on my neck. And I got  one of the worst whippings I ever got, in front of all those people and  my girlfriend. He told me,    Go out there and play ball.    And I   ve been  playing with the big boys ever since. And what made it so   it was a  guy   we were playing Tallahassee. And a guy name Ralph Gaines. A  big guy, Ralph Gaines. He hit a ball. A way long ball. If it had been in  any other park, it   d have been a home run. My way. And I took it like  Grant taking Richmond. It was easy for me. They   d had no trouble out  of me all that day but the point I   m trying to show you, you know when  you get what some people call sassy, he told me to go play and I said no  in front of all those people and that   s the worst thing I could have did in  my life. But otherwise, I could catch a baseball, I could run. I wasn   t a  home run hitter. I could bunt and get on base but I do have the record of  inside park home runs. I had thirteen of them. That   s inside the park  home runs, with my speed and everything. I could run and it doesn   t  sound real, but in high school, sandlot, United States Army, in the Negro  11  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  League, I never was thrown out stealing a base.  That   s impressive.  But the point was, I went up against Josh Gibson, this great negro  baseball player, he was the catcher. And I took off on him. He threw me  out ten feet, but the guy dropped the ball. That   s the only thing, so I  didn   t try that no more. He didn   t stand up, just sat on his hunches.  Plopped it over there.  Yeah, so baseball was good to me. I watch it every day now. I was  watching it before I came up here, I was watching baseball. I   m just  crazy about baseball.  What   s your favorite team?  St. Louis Cardinals and the Yankees. I just worry about them just like  Muskogee High School, OU in football, you know, whatever. It just  worries me to death about them, because I love sports.  What team did you start playing with when you were in high school?  I started with the Muskogee Cardinals.  And that was back in    37?  Yeah, in    37. Then I went to the United States Army and played the  United States Army. When I got out I played with the Detroit Wolves.  What year did you get out?  I got out in    46.  So you played with the Wolves?  Detroit Wolves, Lincoln All Stars, and the Newark Eagles, they moved  to Houston, so the Houston Eagles. I was there and played in Canada. I  finished in Canada.  What team were you playing for up there?  Well, whatever they   d take, like on the Sundays, I would go down in  Arkansas and play on the white team in Arkansas. Just different teams.  A team would pick you up, you know. Like see, when the Kansas City  Monarchs come here, if they were playing a different team, I would play  12  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  with the Kansas City Monarchs. They let me play with them because I  was living here, running a beer tavern then. I played with them. And if  the Red Sox came, I played with them. But I did play with Memphis Red  Sox and Newark Eagles. Newark Eagles was in the Negro League. I was  in the League with the Houston Eagles. When the other teams in the  League come here I would play with them.  Now were the Muskogee Cardinals     It was a good team. But almost all the guys off the Muskogee Cardinals  went to the Negro League. We had a pitcher named Lloyd Bruce and Joe  Sparks, and Dan Thomas, Henry Williams,    Fate    Dumas, Reggie  Givens, Jess Bradley, Travis Taylor, Elbert Alexander.  What was the first name?  Elbert. He   s still living around here. He   s a plumber. And let me see, I  can   t think of Davis    first name. His name was Davis. And W.G. Parker,  he   s still living. He   s ninety-five. He was a school teacher. One of the  best baseball players around this part of the country, W.G. Parker.  In fact, I think he   s on our list to interview.  W.G. Parker? He   s a good baseball player.  So those were all folks with the Muskogee Cardinals. Now when you  played with them, was that where you   d get paid by the day based on     Yeah, get paid by the game. Some days we   d make ten dollars or fifteen  dollars, some days we didn   t make nothing. Just according to how it   d  turn out. When we went to Arkansas and different places we made good  money, down in Fort Smith and Fayetteville. They paid good. Now I   ll  tell you, it   s a funny thing about that baseball. White folks love to see  negro baseball players. Now when we played here in Muskogee, football  or baseball, white folks occupied the grand stands. They got their seats  first.  But they   d all come out for the games?  They would turn out real good. You understand the point I   m trying to  get over. They supported it. They loved to see us; the same about  football. You notice now in baseball, negroes is a dying species. They   re  not fooling with it, now. Hank Aaron and Willie Mays and them guys  are going around trying to get negroes back in baseball. They play it in  the south, but not up in this part of the country. When I was a little boy  on Douglass school ground, you couldn   t get there for a baseball game.  13  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  They don   t do it no more. That   s where all the money is. They like  football and basketball. Now we dominate football and basketball but  that   s a short life. You can play baseball fifteen to twenty years. Football  you could get hurt tomorrow and not play no more. Get a knee knocked  out, a shoulder.  You could be gone by the time you get out of high school.  That   s right. Get blown out and not even make it.  So you ended up playing baseball all through high school probably  mostly during the summer or on weekends too.  Yeah, they didn   t stop you from playing with the Muskogee Cardinals.  They   d just go ahead and play, wasn   t nothing said about it. Now, it   s  against the rules. Then there wasn   t nothing said about it.  I think you mentioned earlier that you graduated from high school once  you came back from the Army?  See, my class was in 1941. But I went to the Army in    42. My high  school finished playing in    42. I was in the service, I got out in    46. I  went and played baseball for two or three years and then in    49 I went  that fall and got my     You had mentioned that your dad had a barber shop.  Yeah, on south Second Street.  Do you want to talk a little bit about that and the neighborhood too,  what the different businesses were there?  See, now on South Second Street in the 300 block, there were three beer  taverns, a funeral home, a hat shop, two cleaners, about three cafes, and  two barber shops. My daddy operated King   s Barber Shop there. He was  in the Convention Hall in Simmons Barber Shop and he moved to  King   s Barber Shop on Second Street. Shave was a nickel and a haircut  was a dime. He got twenty-five cents on the dollar. He had to make a  dollar before he made a quarter. We   d leave home in the morning going  to school, walking to school, come by and get a nickel or dime from him  for our lunch money. Beans were a nickel and a bun was a penny. He  gave us six cents sometimes. Sometimes he gave us a dime. Sometimes  he didn   t have nothing. A lot of times we went to school, didn   t have  nothing to eat. But after we started playing football, playing sports, the  coach saw that we did have a little something to eat. Because things was  bad then. You   d get two loaves of bread for a nickel. Eggs a nickel a  14  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  dozen.  So what did the coach do? Did he bring food for practices?  No, he didn   t. He just told me to go to the cafeteria and tell them to feed  me.  So they tried to take care of you?  Now, there was quite a few prominent families in the school when I was  going, the Simmons, the Tolletts, the Twines. And those boys, we were  all friends and they saw that you had something to eat. You understand  what I   m trying to say?  Yeah.  Good friends that played football together. You   d get a bun for a penny.  Great big bun for a penny. Well this man will put a spoon of beans in  there and it   s a bean burger. A lot of times I went to school and didn   t  have nothing to eat, and didn   t have anything at home. Come home in  the evening, we still didn   t have nothing. Maybe Mama would boil some  potatoes or bring us some from work. And God took care of us. He   s a  good God, he took care of us. But now, on Second Street   negro  history   now in this town they had about seven lawyers and about six  doctors, three clothing stores, six barber shops, taverns everywhere.  Muskogee was a good place. When World War II started, there was  work at Camp Gruber. Up until the late    50s Muskogee was really  booming, I mean really. Everybody made money and everything.  Everybody was doing real good.  So during the war years it picked up some?  Oh yeah, because they had about 40,000 people out there at Camp  Gruber.  All of a sudden.  They brought their families in. People living and jobs and everything.  They had full passenger trains coming north and south here.  Oh yeah, I heard this was one of the dinner stops on the train?  Yeah, on Broadway and the Katy tracks, they had a real big train station.  Had the Blue Bonnet, the Texas Special, and the Katy Flower and the  Katy. We had two going south and two going north that was passenger  trains. Then they had the Frisco and the Midland Valley. The Frisco  15  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  would go to Okmulgee, Midland Valley would go all the way up to  Tulsa. It was blowin   , Muskogee, it really was good for a while.  What kind of restaurants did they have if people got off the train in  Muskogee?  Oh yeah, they   d get off the train and come right through that Court  Street. And there were four black cafes about two blocks from the train  station. A drugstore.  So that   s where everybody would go?  Yeah, everybody would go, and at night taverns and everything. You  couldn   t get up and down the street at night, everything was really     So much going on.  Yeah, a lot going on.  A lot of music and clubs.  Oh yeah, music and juke boxes and we had three or four dance halls and  everything.  What were some of the dance halls that     You know where the little caf   is on Main and Denison right there? It   s  the caf   down there. By Caesars    or whatever it is there, upstairs was a  dance hall. That was Deluxe Hall. That   s where the negros had their  dances, right up there. And in this town, I don   t know if you   ve heard of  Count Basie.  Oh yeah.  Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, they all came here. Right down on South  Second Street they had the Grand Hall. Had the Grand Hall and Little  Richard has been here.  Ella Fitzgerald?  Ella Fitzgerald has been here and Ike and Tina Turner. They got their  start here, Ike and Tina Turner.  I didn   t know that.  For fifty cents, they got their start. They   d come here about five or six  16  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  times a year. Ike and Tina Turner, Little Richard, Count Basie, Duke  Ellington, everything was just     Sounds like the place was really hopping.  Oh yeah, I tell you, switching over to the white folks and York Street,  that was night club row. They had about fifteen night clubs on York  Street. I mean they really jumped over there.  Did people go back and forth between the two sets of night clubs?  Hopping between them all night long.  But I mean, did you get folks from that side of town coming over to  Second Street and coming over to night clubs?  Negroes would come from Tulsa and Tullahassee and Fort Gibson and  McAlester. People come from all out of town, Tulsa, and we had big  dances and everything here.  But you didn   t have folks from the white community coming over from  the night clubs?  No, no, no.  There wasn   t anybody coming back and forth?  There was a time   you know where Main Street is? Negroes couldn   t go  east unless you were working over there. You couldn   t go east. And  don   t be caught over there at night. But this is true, Tulsa now, not then,  now, Tulsa and Muskogee are the most prejudice towns in Oklahoma.  Tulsa is open and Muskogee is sneaky. You can go downtown and go to  the jail house now, eighty-five percent of the inmates are black, from  fifteen to twenty-five. And you know what the county attorney is doing  to them? Sending them all to the penitentiary. See we got a lost  generation in there now, from eighteen to twenty-five. All in the  penitentiary. They built a new penitentiary and everything. I can   t  understand it now. They   re getting into this dope.  What do you think happened to that?  Listen. Ain   t no black man can get dope into Muskogee to amount to  anything. How are we going to go to Mexico and get dope, or go to  California and get it? You got me. If they catch you with two cigarettes  you go to jail and get six months but the big boys will go free. They go  free. But that   s all right. Time   s going to bring on changes. It brings on  17  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  changes.  I feel sorry for the young blacks, but not all of them. Those that are not  working and trying to make that easy money. There   s big money in  dope, it   s not going to be easy money. You get yourself in trouble  instead of going to school, going to church. Church houses, you don   t  find no young men in church now days. Blacks, I   m talking about. They  don   t go to church. You got to put God first. You know, it   s he that  made you, not we ourselves. Some people you can   t tell nothing. But  this dope is just out of hand. It   s out of hand with the young blacks. But  I don   t think locking them up is solving the problem. That   s not solving  the problem. Get the root of it and cut it out.  When do you think the first changes started happening? Because I know  you had mentioned during World War II things really started hopping in  Muskogee and that went for a while. It sounds like the Second Avenue  area was the place to be.  Well I   ll tell you what they did. This is what happened to us. We asked  for integration and we got it. The government passed it. The first thing  they did in Muskogee, they tore out all the black schools, eliminated all  the black schools. Now see, when we had Manual Training High School  up there, had all those teachers, we turned out doctors, lawyers. There   s  no black doctors turned out in this town anymore because they don   t  have time for them in school. We had doctors and lawyers. I was in the  twelfth grade and I still got whippings in school because I was a bad  boy. You touch one now, you   ve got to answer. I got a whipping in  school because I was a bad boy. But see, we asked for the wrong thing.  We didn   t need integration. We should have asked for equal  opportunities, not I want to be with you. Not that. Equal opportunities.  That would have solved a lot of problems. But they tore down all the  black schools.  So those were the ones that were in the neighborhoods, too.  Yeah, they tore them down. They tore down Douglass, Wheatley,  Dunbar, Langston.  But those were all in the neighborhoods?  Yeah, neighborhood schools. Douglass was on the south end, out in the  Reece Addition was Langston, out in the west side was Wheatley, and  Dunbar was right there.  So how far did the kids have to go then?  18  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  They could walk to school. I walked from the south end to Manual, and  there wasn   t no buses, I walked every day. I did it for four years.  But I mean when they tore down those schools, how far were the kids  from their schools then?  Oh they had to bus them all over town. They needed buses then because  it wasn   t walking distance. They bused them all over town, that   s  everywhere. And you   re not having good students now. In order to have  a good student, he has to want to be himself. When I was going to  school, teachers kept you after school, whipped you and made you get to  work and everything. But they don   t do it no more. They don   t touch  kids no more. They don   t get whippings at home.  Do you think part of that   s because there aren   t schools in the  neighborhoods where people know the kids?  Well neighborhood schools would be good, but you have got to have  good parents. The parents are the main thing. You   ve got to have good  parents. If you don   t get this stuff at home how are you going to get it at  school? Now, I   ve got my kid and I turn it over to you. That   s taking the  responsibility off of me. Get up and I go to work and leave you there,  you haven   t had no breakfast and you get to school the best way you  can. Then come to you, and you have to put up with me all day. That   s  not right. It   s really not right. But life goes on. Time brings on changes.  You can   t have the cake and eat it too.  How do you think some of those changes affected the neighborhoods in  Muskogee?  Well the neighborhood is pretty shot in Muskogee. I   ll tell you why the  neighborhood is pretty shot. After this integration started, blacks are  everywhere.  So there   s no neighborhood really?  So that neighborhood stuff is out. Good neighborhoods are out now.  You   ve got to lock your doors. See, we didn   t have a lock on our door.  You have to lock your doors. People will rob you and break in on you,  drive by shooting and all this. It   s really bad. That   s everywhere. Not  just here, that   s everywhere. Tulsa is bad, woo  You haven   t seen  nothing, in Tulsa it is bad.  So speaking of neighborhoods, why don   t you tell me a little bit about  where you grew up in town?  19  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  I grew up in a neighborhood on the south end down here. A good  neighborhood, all the kids had us a park down there and we played and  everything. We could sleep out in the yard at night and sleep on the  porch.  You said that was down on Freemont?  No, down on south Seventh Street.  Who were your neighbors?  Well on south Seventh Street, two doors from me was a preacher,  Reverend Gaywood, and all the other people were church members. You  know, it was just a good neighborhood. There were three churches  within a block of me. Beebe  Memorial , Seventh Day Adventist and  Rayfield. And a whole new church, there was five churches. We   d go to  church, Mom would make us go to church and go to Sunday school. It  was just good. Life was just better then.  Did your family go to church when you were growing up?  Oh yeah, my daddy was a deacon, my mama, yeah   we all went to  church. I was the only black sheep in the family. I was the only one who  got in trouble. The rest was good. I got a good sister and a good brother.  Which church did you go to growing up?  Rayfield. But I   m going to the Methodist now. Ward Chapel, that   s  where I go, I teach Sunday school, an adult Sunday school class.  When you were growing up at Rayfield, who were some of the church  members? Did you have teachers?  Yeah we had good school teachers there. We had good members but  they all passed away. We had a good thing because we had about three  teachers going to church down there and then we had good businessmen  going down there so the environment was real good.  And they all lived in the neighborhood there.  Yeah, and see then, a neighbor could whip you. You had to mind  everybody then. In my neighborhood down there, we   d very seldom see  a policeman because one lived down there, Mr. Green, he lived down  there and didn   t have to arrest nobody, nothing like that. No break-ins  and stuff like that. You didn   t hear nothing about that kind of stuff. And  there   s another thing about it too. There wasn   t no such thing as girls  20  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  coming up pregnant. You know like mothers then you hear about there  being no father. That didn   t happen when I come up. We had a lady at  Manual Training High School named Nellie Weaver Green. Them girls,  you   d better not come two words from them. Every now and then a girl  would come up pregnant. Every now and then it was kept quiet and  everything.  With your church when you were growing up, what kind of activities did  you have or what kind of community activities were there besides  baseball?  Well at our church, you had BYPU and Starlight Band and bible study  and prayer meeting. There was a lot for kids to do. Church would always  go different places, you know taking kids. They had a youth choir. They  had something for you to do at church. Church was good, real good.  BYPU is that Baptist Youth   ? What did the P and the U stand for?  It was Baptist Young People   s Union. And then they had Starlight Band.  And then they had a Sunday school and everything, and a youth choir.  A lot of things to keep you busy.  And then you really didn   t have you a girlfriend unless she was at  church and everybody would go to church. Every now and then  something is going to happen and you   d hear about strays, people living  out there, things like that, some bad things happen. But that   s life.  Getting back to your dad   s business, you talked about his being a barber  and working at King   s Barber Shop. How long did he do that?  He wasn   t quite seventy-two when he passed. My daddy cut hair from  1929 to 1972. He was a good barber, too.  So King   s Barbershop was still around in 1972?  Yes, when he passed. That   s when they closed down. They closed down  after he passed in 1972. That   s when urban renewal took over and they  tore his ten Second Street down and he moved there close to Seventh  Street and he died before he got a chance to open that barbershop.  So a lot of the neighborhood business went away.  See back then, on every other block there was a neighborhood grocery  store.  21  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Did some of that stay down on Seventh?  Yeah.  Now they got rid of everything on Seventh?  Well those people just died out. See we had Maxey Grocery on Seventh  Street, Proutt Grocery on Seventh Street and Schoats on Seventh Street.  Then we had Elka   s on Boulevard, that   s about two blocks away. Then  we had Sharp   s, then we had Buchanan   s, and Gentry and Vaughn   s.  Those people just died out and the young people just didn   t take over,  just didn   t run them.  Just had bigger stores other places.  There   s one place south on Fourth and Boulevard, Buchanan Grocery.  That building is closed right now. He passed and his two boys, one of  them   s in the penitentiary, the other one   s on at a...  So most of those businesses started going away maybe in the early    70s?  Yeah, all the groceries, they started   well these Homeland, Safeways,  the big chains just knocked them out.  And they started coming in about the same time?  At one time in Muskogee on Main Street was a chain grocery store,  Safeway, Piggly Wiggly, Humpty Dumpty, Ma and Pa Redneck Store  right up on Main Street. People would go up and shop on a Saturday and  everything. You know, there ain   t nothing open now. People got along  with neighbors. People came here from down at Summit and out at Fort  Gibson and Taft and Tullahassee, shopping and buying     Make a day of it, yeah. Who were some of the community leaders that  you remember?  Well then on the south end down there A.C. Schoats was a big  politician. A.C. Schoats and Emery Jennings.  A.C. Schoats, would that be Albert Schoats?  No, that wouldn   t be Albert Schoats.  No relation?  That was a different Schoats. This man would be in his nineties now. On  22  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  the south end Ms. Edwina Harel, she was a big politician down there,  community leader. One of our top leaders in this town was Jake  Simmons, you ever heard of him? Jake Simmons and Grainger and the  Twines, leaders like that. Great leaders in this town. We had some big  men in this town. And doctors, we had about six doctors. Dr.  Montgomery, Dr. McFall, Dr. McElroy, Dr. Taylor, Dr. French and Dr.  Smith, two Dr. Smiths.  That   s what everybody says, two Dr. Smiths.  And Tollets. I   ll tell you, this town was really going at one time.  Were there any black families in town that got money through part of the  oil boom?  Yes, look here. Mr. Simmons went to Midland, Texas and Longview and  the people had oil down in Texas. And the white folks messed with their  land   he moved them all here. There were two ladies here that were real  rich. Simmons was one of the biggest oil men in this town. He was until  he passed. I   ll tell you what happened. Right after World War II, Exxon,  Phillips Petroleum and Shell and all of them had all this oil over in  Africa over there. And them people was killing all them people over  there. And so the Edmonsons, one was governor and was up in Congress  and he said,    We know a man back in our home town that could help  you out over there in Africa.    They chose Jake Simmons. He went to  Africa and straightened out all those oil companies. Paid him big money.  And each one of them that comes in Uganda gives him a dollar on every  oil well over there. It was about two million, he come back a millionaire,  Simmons did. He had Simmons Royalty   he had about three royalties,  but they all just died out. They just started dying. When his old man died  that was a big blow to Muskogee. His son has died now. Just didn   t keep  up at all. But he still has property out there around Haskell. I don   t know  who got it, but that was his property all up there. Now we lost a good  person last year. You didn   t know Carol Henry did you?  No.  She was a real estate lady, young lady and we lost her. We lose good  people, all of them die out on us. And then the Dr. Twines died out, the  Simmons, great leaders, the Graingers, the Ragsdales and all that.  Do you see any of that middle generation coming along these years?  They don   t pay it no mind. It   s not even on their mind. They want new  cars and you don   t catch anybody in big homes and everything. You  don   t catch big families no more. You know people who have eight or  23  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  nine kids, you don   t catch that. I mean people     Yeah. You just don   t have that.  Ain   t got time. And I   ll tell you another thing. If a lady now has a baby  and she marries, or is not married, it sets her back five or six years,  regardless of how good you   re doing. It sets you back. Time goes so fast  and it just    At my home I   ve got a granddaughter. She got a baby that   s  ten months old. The little baby is just now beginning to try to walk and  everything and takes a lot to take care of.  The black Baptist churches in town are Rayfield Baptist Church, Mount  Calvary, Antioch, Jerusalem, Mount Zion, Macedonia, Central Baptist  Church, Beebe, Ward Chapel, those Methodist churches and a Methodist  church in Bethel. And St. Mark, Dean   s Chapel, Seventh Day Adventist  Church.  Have all those been around since you were a youngster?  Yes, they are all old churches. Some of them are older than I am. All of  them are not new churches, just past ones. I   m naming the old churches.  All them I named are old churches.  Are there some that are known for particular things?  Well Rayfield Baptist Church, this building has added on classrooms  and a daycare center for the community. And they have a nutrition  program down there. It   s really going on big down there. Mount  Calvary   s planning on building a new church, and Dean   s Chapel is  planning on building a new church. So these churches are working real  hard and working in the community real hard and trying to get these  people to come to the Lord and they   re trying to spread the gospel. The  pastors are really working hard in this town. Reverend Noble is one of  the top men in this town. He   s one of the top pastors. Reverend Noble is  a top man and W.T. Brown. Reverend  Larry  Smith at that Macedonia  is one of the top teachers in the town, top black teachers in town. And  then we have Mr.  Don  Dumas at Dean   s Chapel, he   s a real good  minister and everything. They   ve got good people in there working with  the young people, concerned about them and everything. And  Reverend  Ralph  Boyattia out there at Jerusalem, he   s working with kids. And  Ragsdale, he   s a city councilman and he   s out there at Mt. Zion, he   s  working with the kids and working with the city and working with the  people and everything, the community. You   ve got to have a good  strong church and you know what they say, the truth will set you free.  Most all the churches have to do is open, they don   t have nothing against  24  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  anybody. They try to help you, really help you. Take my church, Ward  Chapel, most all our members are dying and we have quite a few sick,  but we   re still hanging on. We have a good pastor, W. T. Brown.  There   s very few working in that church, but there   s still people working  in the church trying to help. We have a youth program started, Brother  Cotton is working with the youth program. So we are doing pretty good.  Churches are doing pretty good. They will stand, with or without you,  the church is going to go on, with or without you. And you know what  the old people say on the streets, that one monkey don   t stop no show.  So that   s the way to go.  It   s been a long time since I   ve heard that.  The church is going to go on, with or without you. Some people have  attitude and drop out of church and sin and try to make up their mind  when I   m going to change. You can change now, not do what you going  to do, you might not be here tomorrow. I understand quite a bit about it,  I know right from wrong, and so I   ve got one idea about my life, I know  he   s not through with me yet. I know there   s something for me to do.  But I love the churches and we have some good churches. Good black  churches. They   re doing good work. Doing good work for the people.  Well maybe we can go back now and talk a little bit about some of the  family traditions that you   ve had. When you were growing up, were  there celebrations or particular holidays that you remember?  Well, see, this Emancipation Proclamation on 19th of June used to be a  big   it   s kind of fading away up in this part of the country, but it   s still  celebrated in the south as a day the negro slaves was free. Up this way, it  used to be big in Muskogee, but like I said, the young people coming on,  they don   t know about the history. This  oral history project  is a good  thing. People should know history. This talk won   t be a bit of good if it   s  not in writing. Read about it. If you don   t read it, it don   t do a bit of  good. A lot of things young people need to hear and know about, but  they don   t. With big families, people used to have picnics and go out,  the whole family. Hay rides and families get together and have a big  barbecue and big Fourth of July at homes and everything, but families  don   t do that no more. They just don   t do that. You know, the people tell  you, well we   re having dinner over at our house today and families go  over to Grandma   s house and eat and go to Mama   s house and eat.  Then that fast food come in. McDonald   s come in, and that knocked all  that stuff out. But there   s a few of them still preparing dinners and  everybody sits down at the table. There   s a few of them. You can   t  stamp out everything. You can   t do that. Every now and then you find  something, old traits and traditions going on. There      s a few families still  25  Larson  Reed  held together around the table. There   s still some good mothers and  good fathers in this town and in this world. Still some good ones. But  remember this: God is still in control. He   s still got the last say-so. The  devil, he   s pretty rough, but God is still in control and these family  traditions, now you take big families that have died out in this town.  We   ve lost some good families and everything, but there   s a lot of  jealous people too, you know. Don   t like to hear the name of the  Simmons, the Graingers, and the Twines. But there were some real  important people in Muskogee during that time, some real important  people in Muskogee that would speak up and do things. You   ve got to  speak up for things. They would step forward and try to protect you and  everything. You need protection. You know, you need protection from  the police. They can get the wrong attitude sometime, people give them  wrong information. They be on the wrong track. And we have people  step forward: NAACP and all the churches and the preachers step  forward and do things for you and speak up for you. We need that. It   s  kind of getting away from it. But if we would just learn instead of  building new penitentiaries and build some rehab houses and try to help  people. You need that, but I don   t know what   s going to happen.  Looking back, what world or national events do you think have  significantly influenced your life?  Well, see the thing that kind of saved me, I lost a lot of valuable time  trying to run beer taverns and selling whiskey and stuff like that. But  I   ve come to realize, if I was going to church, your name is in the paper  doing this and doing that, you have kids growing up.    I saw your  daddy   s name in the papers, so and so and so.    You get to thinking, this  is a better   it   s slow, but it   s a better life than that. It   s a better life than  that. I   ve changed a whole lot in my life. I   ve changed a whole lot by  doing different things in my life. But you   ve got to get away from the  worldly things, you just have to let them go. You know, it   s fast money  and it   s easy money and everything like that. It doesn   t do any good.  Say you take every time you look up, here   s a boy, they stop him. Stop  him on the highway. He   s got dope, he   s got a gun, he   s got a car,  money, he loses everything. He goes to the pen. That someone   s life is  gone away, ten or fifteen or five years, two years whatever it is. The  same with this drunk driving. We need some good teachers and good  education, good preachers. You know, a lot of preachers say things just  to satisfy you, but you got to tell the truth. Tell it like it is. I don   t know  about Muskogee, about this mayor  John Tyler Hammons  and  everything. I don   t know about that, how that   s going to come out. But  we have got to get away from this worrying about the mule going blind.  You have to just try to do for yourself in the community and other  people. A lot of people don   t like to tell them right and chastise them  26  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  and everything.  What is it about Muskogee? Is it family that   s kept you in Muskogee over  the years?  Well, family is the main thing, but it   s a funny thing about it. I always  did love Muskogee. I would go off and play baseball and be gone and  I   d be glad to get back to Muskogee. There   s just something about it,  and I   ve had some good opportunities at other places but it wasn   t just  like Muskogee. Have you been around the farm and worked a horse or a  mule? After you get through working him, feed him, and turn him loose  in the pasture how he just started running free, just like this. Well that   s  the way Muskogee is. In Muskogee you   re free and it   s different. You  don   t have to look over your shoulder and look around and everything.  I   m telling you, it   s a whole lot different in Muskogee than Kansas City  and Tulsa and certain places where you have to look over your shoulder.  So, looking back, would you have done everything the same way?  No, I would have improved my life. I   d be like the prodigal son. I   ve had  my chances to be real wealthy and everything but I didn   t take  advantage of it. You know, when you live from day to day, that   s bad.  Putting all the eggs in one basket and all, now that   s bad. But I   ve had  my chances to be. So I   m not complaining. I   m not complaining.  Well what do you want people to remember most about you?  Well I want the people to remember    I have a good past in baseball,  but that doesn   t count. I want them to look at me now. What are you  doing now? I   m going to church, I   m teaching Sunday school, I still can  walk and get around. You know, I   m still healthy. I   m a veteran, I served  my country. I don   t want praise. I don   t want it down here, I want it up  yonder. That   s where I want my praise.  Speaking of praise, from what I understand, they had a big celebration  for you a few years back here in Muskogee.  Yeah, they had two.  You want to tell us a little bit about those?  Well I was honored at the Civic Center when me and McBride, who was  in the Negro League Baseball, we were honored and we got a plaque  from the city sent up from the mayor. And then I was honored at the  football stadium one night, they had me out to the football stadium at  half time and I was honored there.  27  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Was that about the same time?  No, different years, I had two. And then I   ve been to Houston three  times speaking on Negro League Baseball. Been down to Houston, been  to Kansas City and I   ve been to Guthrie. I go to Guthrie every year and  speak on Negro League   it   s a lot to do, and with my eye sight, I can   t  do like I want to. I would go forth and do a lot more things. See I know  all the Negro League Baseball players that   s living, and all the activities.  I can sit down and talk about all of them. Willie Wells and Josh Gibson  and Dick See and Buck Leonard and Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson  and Campanella. I can talk all about them and give a history of those  guys, but with my eyesight, I don   t drive. And I can   t get to different  places to speak like they want me to. I can   t get out and direct and help  young people, you know demonstrate this, demonstrate that. That   s what  they want, somebody to be able to demonstrate to young people. If I  could see, I   d get a good job with baseball. There   s still good jobs in  baseball for older people. Instructors and good ideas and so on, so on, so  on. You know, you can tell the guys different things to help them in  baseball and everything, that   s realistic. It   s wide open in sports, but  with my eyesight I   m just thankful to be able to get around.  Well are there any final thoughts you have on Muskogee, things that we  didn   t talk about that you want to touch on?  Well, I would just like to talk about the Manual Training High School,  all the good teachers they had up there when they turned out lawyers,  doctors, school teachers. When they integrated, the teachers don   t have  time to have patience and sit down and help them to be this and help  them to be that. Almost any student right now, black student can be a  doctor if he wants to be one. He not   s going to get too much help. Ninety  percent of the time he   s got to do it himself. Got to step forward, but just  like a man be out there walking. You   ve got to help him along walking.  They don   t have patience with him. See, when I was going to Manual, I  got a whipping in the twelfth grade, all through school. They   d keep you  after school, make you get your lesson, do this and do that. You have got  to put that nail into that student and drive it in to him, and tell him this  and that, be patient with him and help that student. You   ve got to help  him.  You ever watch Sanford and Son? Sanford would say,    I got it and a lot  of them haven   t got it.    You got to tell them. See, we had a football  coach and he was a good football player, but he   d tell you if you weren   t  doing good. He   d say,    Son, them pair of shoes you got on, you don   t  need to be here on the football team. Why don   t you go get in the band?     Because everybody hasn   t got it.    Why you got those shoes on, who  gave them to you?       A nice guy gave them to me.       Well you don   t  28  need them. Give me them shoes, and we   ll give them to somebody. Why  don   t you get in the band?    And see, a lot of them are out there on  account of their families and things like that. His daddy   s a doctor, his  daddy   s a lawyer. But you always got to use the best. You don   t fool  nobody, just got to use them.  I was on a lot of baseball teams and got cut loose. I got cut loose. Now I  was on the baseball team and I knew that I was one of the top baseball  players on there. I knew that. But I was always the married one on the  team that had children. And this manager was thinking. I   d gotten letters  from my wife, we need money for this and I   d go to him and he   d give  me money to send home. And he knew we was going up north to Canada  and there was going to be some bad days and we needed money, and he  let me go. He didn   t let me go because I wasn   t a good baseball player,  he let me because of the conditions. I didn   t know it right then. It really  hurt me, because I knew I was a good baseball player. But he told  somebody else and it got around to me. That   s the reason why he let me  go. And I got a chance before that season was over to play against the  team. It really hurt. I tell you, different things happened to me and that  really hurt. But that   s life.  I went to Birmingham one time with some guys. One guy was a super  baseball player, he died a young man, twenty-one. He and I and another  guy went down there and I was sixteen or seventeen. Got off the bus and  the man, he sent for two. I kept coming and he said,    Who is this fellow  here?    They said,    Well we brought him down here, he   s a good ball  player, going to be.    He said,    I didn      t send for him.    A man named Jim  Taylor. A good baseball man. He   s one of them guys that, I need to be in  school not   he said,    Son, how old are you?    And I told him. He said,     Do you still go to school?    And I said,    Yes sir.       A bus ticket costs  seventeen dollars, you take this      he gave me twenty dollars      You  take this and you go on back home.    And the guy told him,    You  said          I didn   t say that. I   m the manager here, you go on back home.     I went to crying. He said,    The boy is just trying to talk to you. He   s just  good as we are.       I said go on back.     Then finally they came here and played Muskogee. I played with the  other team that played against them. I   ve seen him two or three times  and he   d see me and start laughing.    What   s wrong?    He told me why  he did that, because I should have been staying in school. I didn   t have  any business being out there with those men. He said men, they drink  and chase women and stay up all night. It wasn   t no place for me. He  was just looking out for my welfare. You don   t fool with the wrong  women and drinking whiskey and them guys staying up late at night and  I   d have trouble with them. He said,    I sure can   t be babysitting or  nothing like that.    He talked to me for about two hours. He and I turned  29  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  Reed  Larson  out to be good friends. People look out for you sometime.  Yeah. Well thank you so much. Is there anything else you wanted to say?  I appreciate you coming around.  Well we appreciate you.  You go to church? You know after the preacher gets through preaching,  what he says? The door is open. You want to join, come on down  No, I  do this all the time. See I go to Houston and Guthrie and Oklahoma City  and Kansas City and one time as far as Portland and speak. One time in  Houston I was on TV a whole hour. A whole hour. The man at the TV  station is saying,    I don   t understand you.    And I said,    What   s the  matter?    He said,    I   ve been running this station for twenty years and  the longest people stay on my station is fifteen minutes and then we  hurry up trying to get them off. And you   ve been on here an hour.     People were just asking questions and so on and so on and so on. Had a  good time and everything. I was on then and I was on radio a long time.  I talked and answered a lot of questions. I   ve still got my hair. At my  age, most everybody   s bald. But I still got my hair.  That   s impressive.  Just one thing, my eyesight. That really gets me down. But otherwise, I  appreciate coming. So thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
