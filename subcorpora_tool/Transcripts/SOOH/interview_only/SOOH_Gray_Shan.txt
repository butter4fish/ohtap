 Little Thunder  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, May 22   2013 , and I   m interviewing Shan Gray as part of the Oklahoma Native  Artists Project for the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We   re at Shan   s home in Edmond,  Oklahoma. Shan, you   re an artist from a family of artists. Your public  sculptures can be seen throughout central Oklahoma, from Edmond to  Norman to Guthrie. Your subject matter is as often non-Native as it is  Native, but your pride in your Osage identity shows up clearly in your  work. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Certainly.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and I grew up in Bartlesville.  Great place, especially the    50s.  What did your mother and father do for a living?  My mother was a stay-at-home mom, looked after us. My dad worked  for Phillips Petroleum. I think that was about the time I was born, he  went to work at Phillips. He was a police lieutenant in Bartlesville after  the war and worked his way up. You need to stop me sometimes because  I ramble on and one thought leads to another. He was convinced by  some execs at Phillips to run for police chief. He knew if he lost, he   d  lose his job. He lost. That   s how he went to work for Phillips. The execs  that wanted him to run against the chief of police got him on at the  Research Center, and he worked there for, gosh, twenty-eight, twenty-nine  years.  Wow. Now, you have two brothers and a sister, (is that right) all of  whom are artists?  5  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  I   m the mistake of the family. Greg, the oldest, is eleven years older than  me, and then Clancy   s about eight, and my sister   s seven.  So you   re the youngest.  Yes.  Were you close to your grandparents on either side?  My grandparents were deceased on my dad   s side. He   s full-blood  Osage. I always found it interesting: my grandfather was orphaned  during the Indian wars in the 1860s, and my dad was the last child of  Clarence Gray Sr. His mother died giving birth to him in the    20s. From  about 1860 to when I was born in 1956, that   s three generations. That  means a lot to me, the historical aspect that we   re a very young country  and a young state. When you   re young, time seems so long, and it   s  really not long at all.  What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Two? Three? Very early.  What was it?  It was a horse, a horse and rider.  A painting?  I vaguely remember a buffalo. I don   t know if it was a  Jerome  Tiger or  not.  In your home or elsewhere?  You know, I don   t know.  How about your first memory of doing art?  My first memory, good question. I love crime shows, Law and Order,  and they always ask,    Where were you on May 7, 2005?    Well, I ate  lunch two hours ago, and not only can I not tell you where I ate, I can   t  tell you what I ate. You   re asking me questions I   .  That   s okay. (Laughter)  I guess I was four years old. My mom kept it. Clancy and Gail were  6  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  given art lessons, and Jack Grace noticed that I was doodling and told  my mom I could stay because I was a quiet kid and I liked to draw. I  remember doing a dinosaur. I think I was, like, three or something,  pretty young.  This was private art lessons that your siblings were getting, and he  noticed that you could draw, too, and let you stay.  It was a summer thing.  So did you continue to work under him? Did he continue to give you  little assignments or     Yes, and he moved. I don   t recall why, but I only went for two or three  years. I think it was during the summer when sports was going on, and  there was a conflict there. It made a huge impression on me.  Were you and your siblings competitive in terms of art?  No, there was too much time. They were quite a bit older than I was. I  know they were always coming to me to do things for them like school  assignments.    Hey, would you draw this?    I   d go,    Sure.    (Laughter) I  didn   t think anything of it, but I must have done a thousand wildcats  over a ten-year period. That was College High Wildcats.  How about your other art experiences in elementary school or middle  school?  Well, a valuable lesson that I learned, it was third grade, and there were  two artists in the class: myself and a fellow named Kim. For  Thanksgiving, they had Kim do the pilgrim, and I was to do the Indian.  We had crayons. I did my Indian in buckskins, and I wanted to catch the  silver wet buckskins. Of course, crayons clash real bad, so you have  brown and silver. The third grade teacher chastised me for clashing  those crayons, and I didn   t pick up another pencil or crayon until seventh  grade.  Even then, I knew what I was doing. That sounds pretty pretentious of  me, but, you know, she didn   t understand what I was trying to do. It  taught me to be very careful what I say to young artists because of the  effect it had on me. In seventh grade, my brother Clancy, who   s always  been a big influence in my life goes,    It   s an easy A. Take art class.    So  I did.  I remember in ninth grade, there was a science contest for a poster, and I  did this picture of Einstein and  E mc2 . I remember all week, I was just  7  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  nervous about that competition. I won, but I never did another  competition after that because, one, who were they to judge me? What  are their qualifications as artists? If they are, (now, this is terrible) I  thought,    I want it to be worth something.     What got me over the hump, I have some kids that I instruct. I always  wanted to be a homicide detective or a movie director. I   d like to direct  films, storytelling, if you will, or a sculptor. Those were my three main  goals since I was little. I ended up going back to art to sculpting because  it just seemed like something I wanted to do, that I felt driven to do,  though I tried the others and I probably would   ve been successful at that.  I attribute that to my mom and dad. They just gave us a lot of confidence  that you work hard enough and you know your business, then, given the  opportunity, you   ll be ready to take advantage of it. I find that to be a  truism, that, just prepare, and when opportunity knocks, you   ll be ready.  Though, I wasn   t ready when the art world     Side note. I forgot the right term you use. I lived in Denver and Chicago  and Dallas and LA, just trying to get a feel of the country and other  people, and I recall I decided I wanted to go to Kansas City Art Institute.  I worked real hard on an art portfolio. Our apartment got broken into.  They stole the stereo, the TV, and my art portfolio.  Oh my gosh   So I never tried to get into the   there was too much work in that.  How old were you?  Twenty-two, twenty-three, so that kind of pushed me into other  directions. It was after a really bad automobile accident. I, to this day,  don   t know where Gary saw my work. I had broke my back. I had a  fractured skull. I could no longer do the regular manual jobs in the oil  field. At the time, I was working out in the oil field. He said,    Do you  want a job? I have a small ad agency. Would you like to go to work for  us as an illustrator?    I said,    Well, yes, but how do you know what my  work is?    He goes,    Oh, I   ve seen it. You   re really good.    I said,     Okay.    That   s how I got back into art. If that hadn   t happened   .  Actually, I   d been working for a film production company. This  would   ve been 1980. They were going to do a film that required a lot of  young Indian kids riding horses. They asked,    Do you ride?    I said,     Yes,    and they said,    Can you instruct children on how to ride?    I said,     Well, certainly.    To myself, I was saying,    Man, I need to get back  there and start riding.    (Laughter) It   s not something like swimming.  8  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  My dad was killed in an automobile accident. I was supposed to go back  that Saturday, back to LA. That   s one thing I really liked that I learned  by living in other parts of the country. When I moved out to Los  Angeles, I had work the second day I was there. I got off the plane, met  a friend who   d been out there a couple years. If you had a good work  ethic and had the ability to communicate, work was plentiful. To this  day, I   m amazed how quickly   .  I was there three days, and someone asked me to interview with CBS for  the mailroom. I got hired that day. That afternoon, I got hired on a  production company as a gaffer, which is lighting personnel. I just love  that business because it   s a very people-oriented business, though, at the  time, I was not mature enough to   I just figured there   d always be work  there, and I ran with a pretty wild crowd.  When I came back that following summer to learn how to teach kids  how to ride, my dad had been killed in that accident. I was supposed to  leave that Saturday; he was killed on Friday. It kind of discombobulated  all my timing. Something inside said,    Don   t go back,    and I never went  back. Part of me wishes I would   ve gone back, but I   m certainly happy  with the life I have now, so I guess things happen for the best.  So this was post-college. Is that right? This was after college?  Yes. I   d gone to OSU. They had some great people in the art world, but  art   s such a subjective business, anyway. I always lean to your more  classical type of work: realism, super realism. The reason you don   t see  a lot of it is, one, it   s very difficult to do, two, it   s difficult to do well.  Most people don   t want to pay for that. Art in Oklahoma, it   s not the  mecca for art. When I first started sculpting, my work in Georgia,  Atlanta, Florida, they recognized me there. Here has an attitude of,     Well, if you   re successful, why are you an artist in Oklahoma?     It was the people that actually brought me back to Oklahoma. Every-body  was just laid back, friendly. I   ll never forget, in LA (I forgot the  name of the highway) it took forty-five minutes to go three miles. I had a  motorcycle. (Laughs) I remember when I first got there, Linda   I came  in, I looked in the mirror, and I had a great tan. I took my goggles off,  and she goes,    What were you doing today?    I said,    I was out riding.     She goes,    This was a stage-three smog alert  You   re not supposed to be  out there.    It wasn   t a tan. It was smog that had discolored me.  (Laughter)  You did tell me a little funny story about Marty Avrett and your, I guess,  first encounter with art classes at OSU. I wonder if you   d mind  9  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  repeating that real quickly.  Not at all. I had picked OSU. There again, people were very important to  me. OSU was just a friendly place. My sister had gone to school there,  so I was familiar with the campus. I was familiar with the night life back  then, and I thought,    Well, I   ll take night classes, and that   ll keep me out  of trouble.    I see this art class, figure drawing, so I go there. This very  nice-looking, naked girl walks up to me. I   m, inside, going,    Wow, this  is college. This is great     I   m there probably, oh, two or three weeks,  and the instructor comes up and says,    Shan, how old are you?    I tell  him I   m seventeen. I think I may have just turned eighteen. He goes,     This is a graduate course. You   re not supposed to be in here. This  won   t count, but since your illustrations are better than anyone here at  the moment, you can stay if you wish.     But you did go on to OCU after OSU?  I went to CSU, I think is what it was called.  CSU in Colorado?  Central State  University .  Okay, Central State.  I don   t know what they call it now here. UCO  University of Central  Oklahoma ?  I think that   s it now, but it was Central State.  My brother Clancy was going there, and he goes,    You ought to try it.     He knew a lot of the instructors. I did. I enjoyed it.  Declared an art major?  Yes. However, I   ve always marched to a different drummer. I love  history. I know this doesn   t go on very well, but I never felt like a piece  of paper was going to do it for me. I   ve had many discussions with  friends that owned companies that go,    Well, I wouldn   t hire someone  that didn   t have a college degree.    Well, I can think of more millionaires  without college degrees than with college degrees.  Did you finish at Central State?  No, I did not. I never graduated. There were times when I   d go to the  class and not show up for the final, knowing full well there would come  10  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  a time when I had to pay for those classes.  Then you did eventually, I guess, after some oilfield work     Oh, that   s what I was going to tell. That   s what I was going to say.  Realistic work, classical work was literally pounded out of every   at the  time. There were some good illustrators there, but by and far I noticed  that you were abstract or modern. That   s what they   d push you toward.  Then it dawned on me, the really good ones could draw well and could  draw classical figures.  I had an argument, not an argument really, a heated discussion. He said,     The ability to draw was no longer necessary in art.    I said,    If you had  two students, and one drew exceptionally well, conveyed a still life  exactly as it was, like a photograph, and then you had another fellow that  struggled and could barely interpret what he was seeing to a piece of  paper, and you took those two different artists and turned them loose on  an abstract piece of work, the one that draws like a photograph said,     This is exactly what I wanted to convey,    I   ll believe him. The one who  couldn   t draw and sits there and goes,    This is what I envisioned,    no, I  don   t buy it. You couldn   t even draw what was in front of you.    To me,  that   s pretty logical. I did notice there were a lot of instructors that had a  difficult time because art   s a really tough market.  So was working for the advertising agency one of the first art jobs that  you got?  Oh, we grew. I ended up leaving as the   I was the art director. There  was just he and his wife and myself. We won three or four big  campaigns. When I left because I got married in    85, my wife said,    Do  you want to sculpt?    I said    Yes.    She goes,    Go for it.    She had a job at  the time that covered us. It   s funny, but when I left I think there were six  artists. The company had gone from three to fourteen people, so we did  real well.  You did. And had you been doing sculpture on the side while you were  working for the company?  Not really. I dabbled but nothing finished, nothing I thought was worthy  of casting. That was another thing. Being a commercial artist, learning  that trade, prepared me for being self-employed and being a sculptor  because I would never finish anything. It was never good enough. It was  incomplete. Well, in advertisement, they   ll give you an assignment at  noon, and you have to turn it in at four whether you like it or not. It  forced me to complete things and meet deadlines, and that was  invaluable later on.  11  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  So you felt like you had the tools. You were ready to try that.  Yes.  Did you start off in galleries, or did you enter competitions? How did  you go about     As I told in that earlier story, I refused to enter any competitions. If  you   re going to enter the public domain in art, you   ve got to enter, but I  rationalized it.    Well, they   re paying good money, so I will swallow my  pride and let so and so judge me. So be it.    I   m trying to remember how  I landed my first commission. It worked out well.  I do remember. I had gone to work in a marble shop to learn how to  work with stone, not realizing they   re two whole different avenues like  airplanes and cars: both transportation, but neither one match. The  fellow who owned the marble shop goes   I was ordering this two-foot-by-  two-foot white Carrara stone, and he asked me what I was doing. It  was really expensive. I want to say it was like five or six grand. It  weighed an unbelievable amount. He goes,    What are you going to do  with this? A big door stop?    I told him. He said,    Why don   t you come  watch how the shop works and how we fabricate things, and this will  give you an idea of how things are done.    So I kind of did a back door  into stonework.  Was that in Oklahoma?  Yes, it was. Young Brothers. Fabulous place. Harvey passed away quite  a few years ago, but his parents are the ones that helped me in the very  beginning. He probably didn   t realize how much help he was. But I  digress.  It was at that point, I was still doing the commercial work when Mike  Wigley, who owned a gallery up on North May, said,    Hey, Shan,  there   s a lady who   s a really fine sculptress who needs some help, some  manual help. Her name is Shirley Thomson-Smith. Would you give her  a hand?    I said,    Sure.    I went and helped Shirley, and she kind of gave  me the inside dope on how things operate and work, the economics of it.  She works mostly in stone?  Bronze. Her work looks a lot like stone because of the patina she  chooses, and a lot of people think it   s stone, but really that   s a patina.  She has a couple pieces in stone, I believe, but by and far they   re mainly  bronzes. There are some ceramics. Shirley is a wonderful person,  12  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  wonderful.  So that was like an apprenticeship.  It was. It was. I have one thing to my credit. I   m pretty mechanically-oriented.  I   m one of those Renaissance guys when it comes to   I want  to know why something works the way it does. I   ve never been afraid of  saws or lasers or anything like that. I   ll never forget. She called, and she  was practically in tears. She had been commissioned to do this clay  piece. She refused to use an armature, and her pieces were solid clay.  Well, that   s okay. You can get away with that when pieces are small. I  kid you not, this piece was about three and a half feet high. It weighed  about four hundred pounds. It was so heavy, it crushed the pallet it was  on. It was so heavy, it embedded itself into her shag carpet, so where the  nails would grab, you couldn   t pull it. You couldn   t move it. It was  breaking in two.  I always laugh because that was   I learned very early there   s a reason  why you use armatures, and it also gives you the ability to go outside  your central plane. If you have a cantilever design, you have to have the  ability to hold that up in the air. About that time, I   d done a piece. I  thought,    Well, I   ll do this.    I felt moved to do this angel, and it was  done in kind of a Renaissance fashion.  John Free, who owns the foundry in Pawhuska, Sr.   John Jr.  and I are the same age, and we became very good friends. He kind of  took me under his wing, gave me the ins and outs on how things were  done and explained why some artists fail. Of all the mediums, sculpting  is the most expensive because of the material, and you can get in trouble  real quick. If you order all your bronzes at once, you can save probably  off the top, 25 percent of your overall cost. I took a gamble on the angel,  and it sold out within a year.  How many in the edition?  There were only eleven in the edition, but it was a real expensive piece.  It was about a  7,500 piece, and that   s twenty-five years ago. There  again, I also learned from Mike   he liked me. Wigley said,    Bring your  piece, and I   m going to put you next to this Jackson.    It was a Land Run.  Excuse me. It was a cattle drive not a Land Run. It was nearly  350,000  for this small bronze.  And this is in a gallery?  In a gallery. It was a higher-end gallery. It was probably the high-end  gallery at the time. Mike has since moved to Santa Fe. He just has a  13  wonderful sense of presentation. He took this angel. Remember I told  you it was  7,500? Well, he put  25,000 on it, stuck it next to that  Jackson, and said,    Watch.    I did. This couple came in, and the man and  woman went back and forth about it. They both liked the angel. He liked  it a lot, or he liked the price. She liked the Jackson, but we think she  liked it because of the price so she could say,    Yes, that   s  350,000.     You could tell he really liked my piece when it came to writing that  check because they bought the big one. They didn   t buy my piece.  It taught me a lesson about where you put your work is very important.  At that point, you learn real quick if you   re a newcomer in the gallery  market, you   re at the whim and fancy of the gallery owner. If he wants  50 percent, 60 percent, okay, you have to weigh it. You   ll probably get  more for your piece because he   s not going to put some low-range price  on it. He   s going to put a high-range price on it, but you   ll still make less  overall.  As Mike has taught me, they   re taking the best gamble because once you  become established and people seek out your work, they   re behind the  eight ball at that point. You can go to another gallery if you want, or  worse still, (I won   t mention names) back-door the gallery, which means  for you uninitiated out there, it   s where you tell a client who has come to  your house,    Go over to this gallery and look at that work, and I can get  that work for you.     I promised myself I would never do that. Apparently a lot of artists do  because they don   t understand that this guy   s lighting bill may be five  grand a month. The air conditioning, lighting chews a lot of electricity  up. I think that was the saddest thing is the conflict that arose from  galleries and the artists. The artist likes to think that the world moves  behind them.  I taught this one little girl. I knew she had a lot of talent. She was a great  painter. She went to Savannah  College of Art and Design . When she  got back, she called and told me this man had approached her. Normally,  she got about  8,500 for her murals. He was offering her nearly eighteen  grand for her mural, and he would cover all the supplies. He was just  buying it outright.  She did it. She was ecstatic. She gets the front of the Chicago Tribune  for the mural for the new Chicago Library of which they paid, I want to  say,  38,000 for the mural. It upset her that he had made more than she  made, and I had to explain to her,    One, you   re unknown. This was a  huge break for you. I can   t tell you how many painters out there would  give their eye teeth to say,    My piece is hanging at the Chicago  Library.       To me that   s just kind of a no-brainer, but you know artists.  14  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  They all march to a different drummer.  And it   s probably not easy for sculptors to wholesale to galleries. You  haven   t done that much.  No. For some reason, I got hooked up to doing commission work, which  was great for me. I didn   t have to worry about going to different  galleries. I   d gone the gallery route and realized there were too many  personalities that I didn   t care to work with. They were fair enough.  They were all right, but it just wasn   t something   . John Free Sr. said,     Shan, avoid working with committees. Always answer to one person.     That was the best advice I got because everybody has an idea.  I   ll never forget. We were already in metal for the Shannon Miller   sculpture  when one of the committee people came up to me with a  drawing they had done of what they thought it should look like. I wanted  to be diplomatic, and I said,    The reason I didn   t use that design,     because I   d thought of it,    was if you make it big, are you going to be  able to see her face?       Well, no. Oh, okay.    What amazed me was we  were already in metal. The main money had already been transferred,  but they were ready to change in midstream the horse we were on.  What do you think was your first breakthrough commission?  Probably Shannon Miller because it was the most visible.  Can you explain who commissioned that?  That was interesting. Blair Buswell was being proposed by part of the  committee. He   s from Utah. I don   t want to go there. It gets real  political, though I had a really good team here in Edmond. They had  rules that we all had to follow. There were probably seven or eight  people that had applied to do the commission. I know Blair; he   s a great  guy. I was the only one to do a maquette, and that was what they asked  for. He shows up and goes,    Well, if you want me to do her jumping  over a globe, I   ll do that,    pointing at my design  He   s going,    If you  want me to do that, I   ll do that     (Laughter) It   s pretty funny, if you  think about it.  We   ll look at it at the end of the tape, but you   ve got a very iconic  gymnastic pose there.  It was so much fun. It   s one particular pose that she does in competition.  It was off the balance beam. She was here. I   ll never forget. She was in  the kitchen. We didn   t live here at the time. It was the other kitchen. She  literally kicks the back of her head. She goes,    Well, Shan, as I come  15  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  down and land on that foot, my back foot comes and touches my  ponytail.    Artistically, it doesn   t look good. It closes up, and it doesn   t  look right. It looks awkward. I   d already done all this work, and, of  course, the armature allows me   so I go ahead and mutilate the work  and bend it so she can see what it looks like the way she wanted. She  goes,    Oh, you   re right. That doesn   t look right.    I said,    That   s why  I          Oh, okay.     So she got to come out and see it, the maquette.  Yes.  Did you work from photographs or actual poses?  I took lots of photographs of her. She posed. I guess she came three or  four times for a couple of hours each time. She   s such a little bitty thing.  It was just an honor.  For some reason, I gravitated toward sport-medium people. I guess it   s  because I played sports. It kind of enabled me to understand certain  things that some artists wouldn   t understand. I have really been blessed  to be around some really unique individuals that are really fun.  Warren Spahn   s my favorite by far just because he and I both smoked,  and he   d always go,    Shan, go find us a place to smoke.    Greg Spahn  told me this story, that toward the end of his life, they (this is that Mayo  Clinic) called Greg and said,    We   ve lost your father.    Probably the  wrong term to use to the guy. They meant they physically lost him, that  he had had disappeared. He was down in the loading dock, smoking  cigarettes with the workers. (Laughter) Had his IV with him, and he  was   .  He was a baseball player?  He was the world   s greatest left-handed pitcher, Major League Baseball.  I was interested in the question   you also did Muscogee Creek baseball  player Allie Reynolds. I was thinking, here you have to do a bust of  someone who is so very athletic. You   re not doing a full figure. What   s  the challenge in that, doing a bust of an athlete?  That   s probably one of my best pieces, the Allie Reynolds. The little  nuances   if the sculpture looks like it   s about to speak or breathe,  you   ve done your job. That   s really hard to do, to get that final look out  of metal because that   s all it is, is metal, one monochrome tone. I don   t  know if you   ve looked at Allie Reynolds.  16  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Just photographs.  Since this is what it is, and I   ll be talking to other art students, you know  if a piece is good or bad. I can promise you, most of my work is  mediocre at best, in my opinion. That   s just because, one, you   ve got to  weigh things timeframe-wise. If you   ve only got four weeks to do three  characters and they   re life-size, you   re going to lose   .  A friend taught me the rule of three is you can have things cheap, you  can have them fast, or you can have great quality, but you can   t have all  three. You can have two of them, but you can   t have three of them. That  really is true. If you want quality, you   re going to give up either time or  the financial end of it. That has proved to be the case, over and over  again.  But back to Allie Reynolds, he and Dr.  Nazih  Zuhdi. I did the bust of  Zuhdi, and that really looks like Dr. Zuhdi, and Dr. Zuhdi said so. He  and I became friends, and he really liked my work. I really felt like I  caught him. Oh, I was about to say, his wife said so, too, and that   s who  you have to please: the spouse. The spouse knows the figure better than  anyone. They look at that person more than anyone. If you get the  spouse on board, you   re home safe. More often than not, it   s a female  that you   re pleasing. (Laughter)  You were one of the Oklahoma Centennial artists. Perhaps those  sculptures were done in connection with that. I don   t know.  Which ones?  Was the Spalding?  No, the Atlanta Braves commissioned me to do that. It originally was  done for Atlanta.  You were one of the Oklahoma Centennial artists. I wonder if you can  tell us what that involved.  Well, I don   t know why they liked my work so much, but I was very  excited because they picked me on quite a few projects. I was told that I  had more projects out than anyone.  Was it six? That   s what I read. I don   t know if that   s correct or not.  That   s probably right. I think they grandfathered in one of the pieces that  had been done before the official   and said it was. But no, as I  17  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  mentioned earlier, it   s great being able to work with the individuals that  have been honored because they all have great work ethics. Even the  Miss Americas    work ethic was probably greater than Warren   s work  ethic. It   s a lot of work being Miss America. That job I   ll look back on  with a certain amount of pride, a certain amount of angst. I signed on  knowing I only had three months to do three figures. These are Miss  Americas   The ones from Oklahoma.  And, duh, Shan. Do you think Miss America knows what she looks like  or not? They   re going to be extremely particular. However, the design I  submitted, because of the time, was three robed   like the women at the  well. It   s kind of a classical, where they   re in robes because I was told it  was the face they were really concerned with. Well, after the first week,  in no uncertain terms, I was going to do it in their winning gowns. One  had maybe two thousand little pearls on the dress. I think it was Susan   Powell . I thought the piece turned out very, very well for the time  given to execute it.  Did that go in the City of Edmond?  Oklahoma City University. There again, not only do you meet these  people, you also meet the institutions. To think more New York  Rockettes came out of Oklahoma City University than any other place in  the country is pretty amazing. Of course, Oklahoma has had, what, six  now, Miss Americas.  Can you name the three, real quickly?  Jane Jayroe, Susan Powell, oh my gosh. Shantel Smith. I can   t believe  I   m drawing a blank.  We can add that in. (Laughter)  Thank you.  What was another public   part of the point of the Centennial artists was  these public works kinds of projects, right?  James Garner. James Garner was really   .  Oh, I bet that was fun.  He   s just as you think he is. He   s just as easygoing and amiable as can  be. Funny side story to that, his wife did not go to all the events that  18  Little Thunder  Gray  were planned. When I first saw her, I thought,    Wow, a trophy wife.     Turns out, she   s actually eight years older than he is. My sister goes,     Get the name of her plastic surgeon,    because she looked like she was  forty years old, a young, young forty. (Laughter) She looked great.  Beautiful woman. Surely, that   s a compliment, isn   t it? I was thinking he  was seventy-eight. That put her at eighty-six.  They had events planned from seven thirty in the morning all the way  until ten at night. That would tax anybody, so I could see why she didn   t  come to every event. He was great. He kept close ties with three or four  individuals in Norman to this day. Just a down-to-earth fellow, really a  super guy. It   s been really advantageous to my daughter who   s got to  meet all these people and see they put on one shoe at a time. There  again, work ethic always comes through, what people are willing to do  to achieve their goals.  Then there   s Billy Vessels. The original   there again, I   m not making  excuses. What happened was, I was the first artist picked to do one of  the Heisman winners. We did it to a certain scale: one and a quarter size.  It got outside the control of whoever was in charge with the overall  design of the game plan, so the second one they put up was colossal size.  It was fifteen feet tall. You had Mutt and Jeff there, and wherever they  got it cast, the casting, well, it suffered because of the size.  There again, that rule of three. You want it fast? Money? Quality? They  ended up having to redo Billy Vessels to get it bigger. Well, their budget  had already been spent on the other four. It was just a real nightmare. I  wish I wouldn   t have gone there. The first one turned out great. The  second one was out of my hands, and we had to get it up in just a record  short amount of time. I was real disappointed in the final quality of that  piece. There again   .  I can see as an artist how frustrating that would be because you feel like,  as you say, it   s out of your control.  You don   t get to do the weld. You don   t get to do   you can if you have  the time. The piece I   m probably happiest with in Norman with James  Garner is the  Cleveland County  Veterans Memorial. That turned out  really well. That was a short design notice. They asked me, and I had,  like, two days to come up with a design. It just hit on all cylinders. Each  side of the five-sided obelisk   you know, obelisks are supposed to be  four sided, but there are five services: Coast Guard, Army, Marines,  Navy and Air Force. They all wanted to be represented. Of course,  there   s an eagle that   s either descending with a flag in its claws, its  talons, or it   s taking off with the flag in the talons. Everybody seems to  enjoy that piece. They   re happy with it.  19  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  I look forward to seeing that. Your most publicized project has  undoubtedly been The American, and that   s still in the works. I wonder  if you can talk about it because it   s a very monumental piece. What  inspired you to want to do it?  I always wanted to do a very large piece, but it   I think good sculpture  tells a story. I don   t care if it   s modern. It evokes some kind of emotion.  I always wondered why there was nothing that saluted or honored my  Native American heritage. The older I got, I realized there were so many  things involved. I was approached a week before they announced they  were going to do a competition for the Capitol dome. I thought they had  already picked the artist, but I was assured it was going to be a straight  race and everybody was   .  I kind of felt that this idea about the young eagle on a young brave,  because of my love of history, I understood we   re a young country.  These things that we think were a long time ago were not long ago at all.  The ideals evoked by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, they just  haven   t improved on that. If we follow it to the letter, we   re going to be  okay. When they announced that Senator  Enoch Kelly  Haney had won  the competition, one of my benefactors called me and said,    You know,  Shan, the Daily Oklahoman ran a competition of the six sculptures and  asked the people what they thought.     I think I ended up with 52 percent of the vote. Senator Haney had 21  percent of the vote, and the remaining 37 percent was divided among the  other four artists. For me to garnish 52 percent of the vote was fantastic.  He said,    That   s the sculpture you need to make big.    At the time, it was  only sixty feet tall. We were doing it for a small museum up northeast.  Northeast United States or Oklahoma?  Oklahoma. We ended up raising it to a little over 113 feet when a fellow  here said,    Look, it   s thirteen million. I   ll give you ten. You raise the  three.    I raised three million in a week, and I thought,    Wow, this is  easy.    (Laughter) He goes,    You know what? We need an elevator in it.     An elevator won   t fit in a 113-foot   . Eleven stories seems like a height,  but it really isn   t. It had to go up to 156 feet to the top of his head to fit a  small elevator. Well, they   re all small.  This is one of the investors?  Yes. At the time, they were midway through the Indian Cultural Center  down on the river. They were afraid it would   this was going to be a  gift to them. It was paid for. It was in great shape. They thought it would  20  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  confuse their attempts to raise money to finish that project. Blake Wade,  head of the Centennial Commission, felt it was a good enough idea and  strong enough piece that he recommended it to Mayor  Bill  LaFortune  in Tulsa. Mayor LaFortune jumped on it.  During that timeframe   bear in mind, all this fell in my lap just almost  immediately. Like I said, I raised that three million in the first week. I  thought, well this isn   t any big thing. We were coming in at thirty  million just to do a fifteen-story body, human being. Top of his head to  the bottom of his feet was 156 feet, and then add   that was 217 feet to  the tip of the eagle.  This elevator goes up this leg and goes into a mezzanine, and then  there   s an observation area right here. There   s a double-helix stairwell  that goes up into the head, so you can actually look out through the head.  Am I going into too much detail?  No, no.  The cost was greatly influenced by   at the time, bronze was, oh gosh, I  want to say it was  1.40 because it   s copper. They were using so much  copper and strategic metal in China eight years ago that any copper-based  product went from, I want to say it was  1.17 up to  5.70 within  just a fourteen-month period. That really made it hard to calculate the  exact cost. During this timeframe, I   m still doing other projects. I   d  learned through my love of history, Gutzon Borglum and Mt. Rushmore,  he said,    Don   t take government money. Don   t do it. Go to the private  sector.    Same with   why am I having a hard time remembering the  Statue of Liberty   s sculptor? Garbaldi? No, that   s not right.  Frederic  Auguste Bartholdi   Garibaldi, I think that might be right.  It   ll probably come to me here in a moment. I bring that up because  when I had to present to a particular government official, he goes,     You   re doing this because you want to be famous.    There were, like,  thirty people in the room, maybe fifty. I said,    I   ll bet a thousand dollars  right now there   s nobody in this room that can name me who did the  Statue of Liberty and Mt. Rushmore,    and there wasn   t one person. He  looked at his fellow government guys and nodded,    Okay, you   re right.     (Laughter)  That   s really interesting because the average layperson is not going to  be thinking in terms of, you get this quote, it will cost this much and  eight years later the material prices have totally changed. Where are  you now with the project?  21  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  This isn   t going to be published for a while, right     Right.     because we made an agreement. We   ll be good. This will all be  behind us. We made an agreement when we put together our private  placement memorandum, which is a contractual agreement with the  investors. The SEC requires us to not do any kind of interview with the  press. If we mention that we are raising funds or we have all our funds  together, anything to do with money is called unintentional solicitation  of funds and they pull our contract.  I think we should just skip all the financial discussion.  Now I can tell you, though, because it   s going to be over with. Once  Sand Springs passed that bond issue   we always had our core group.  We needed to know that a third of the investment money came from  wherever it was going to sit because it had to have somebody speak up  for it in all the political wranglings. Once Sand Springs passed their  bond issue and got their money and we had our land, we   re done. We   re  ready to go. I   m hoping to announce this summer, but I   m not in a big  hurry because, see, I   m not done yet. I   ve still got other fish to fry and  get out of the way before that   s done. There   s no reason this can   t be the  world-class piece it   s supposed to be.  Oh, it   s a gorgeous piece.  Somebody once made the comment,    Why don   t you just scan a live  human being and have them do it that way?    Well, they don   t get it.  They don   t get it.  If I do it right, it should look like I scanned a live human being and looks  like I directly took it from them.  That just reinforces the fact that when you   re an artist, you have to wear  this business hat, but I think especially in your work with large scale  monumental sculpture projects, etc. How do you handle that? How do  you put on that hat?  Some people say I have the patience of Job because I   ve had to be very  patient during the process. I knew, I believe, it was twenty-eight years  they worked on Mt. Rushmore and twenty-seven years for the Statue of  Liberty. We   re just on year nine. I have it on good authority that four  years from now, we   ll be done. It   ll be up. We   ll have cut that time in  22  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  half.  That   s really exciting.  I do know now why these monuments are not thrown up all over the  country, because there   s a lot of work involved.  Does Melanie or your daughter play a particular role in your art  business?  Melanie, my wife, is the one, the gatekeeper, keeps me in line, makes  sure that I don   t get overextended and makes sure all the i   s are dotted  and t   s crossed. I   m a handshake kind of guy, which in this day and age  you really can   t afford to do it that way. People mean well, but  sometimes their mouths write checks that can   t be cashed. (Laughter)  I   d like to talk a bit about your philosophies and techniques. Before you  get to the modeling stage for a sculpture, you do a number of sketches?  In the beginning, I did. As I got older, I did them in my head. I know  that sounds somewhat   but I do. Good sculpture is 360 degrees. You  should be able to be entertained from any angle. Dealing with the human  form is real interesting because we almost generally gravitate to the  front, but the entire piece is something that requires attention. You   re  only as good as the small squalding, or the sum of the details.  Lighting is the key to anything in sculpture. You   re dealing with a static  material. You   re dealing with a metal. You   re trying to breathe life into  that metal and make it like it   s ready to move, and if you accomplish  that, you   ve done your job. There are many ways to attain that, but each  piece kind of dictates what method you can approach it with. As I said in  the earlier thing about two artists and if you can draw photographically,  that helps because it means you understand lighting.  The eyes, which are the window to the soul, are very important.  Sometimes it   s just a suggestion of a dash of light that reflects that gives  you the personality of a piece. I   ve always enjoyed the challenge of your  classical kind of work because it doesn   t take a discriminating eye to  know if it   s good or bad. That either looks like the person, or it doesn   t  look like the person.  I   ll tell you a secret. I did a job for a fellow once that he made me get rid  of his two double chins and fix his broken nose and fix his lazy eye and  put hair back on his head to where it didn   t look like him. He was  thrilled with it and loved it. I didn   t sign it, but he was happy, and I was  happy. I laugh at that. Because of his recommendation or referrals, I   ve  23  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  gotten more work. I   ve been told I was a little bit too nice because I let  people dictate how they want something, but then again I   m just a hired  gun when it comes to commission work. If they want it that way, that   s  their business. I will make it look good, but it   s something that, as I said  earlier, people know if it looks good or it doesn   t.  You sort of had to, I guess, figure out armature on your own.  Going back to the Shannon Miller, that   s an extreme cantilever design  where you have all this weight hanging from the back position. All I  could see was ten drunk fraternity guys jumping up and down on her,  making her bounce off, and it crashing down and killing someone. I was  given a name of a fellow named Luis Santizo. He   s an engineer with  Benham  Companies . This is going back twenty years. I knocked on his  door, and I said,    Hey, I   m so and so. Would you give me a hand?    Then  he figured out the diameter of steel I needed, along with the type of steel  I needed.  That steel that runs up her leg into the base is rated over two hundred  thousand pounds, psi. That is like a six-hundred-dollar piece of steel that  will hold a phenomenal amount of weight. If somebody did get up there  and jump on her, (and I hope nobody does that) it   s guaranteed to  withstand the test of time. Turns out, he was eventually promoted to the  head engineer at Benham, and Benham is a huge engineering firm. He is  the lead engineer. He   s retired now, but he came back for The American.  Oh, great   He   s wonderful. There   s a couple of side stories that are hilarious. It   s  amazing how there   s no coincidences. Things happen for a reason.  Stuart Webb, who   s still with the company full-time and is a younger  fellow, he   s kind of like the lead project manager on it. We just have a  wonderful team, and that was another thing that helped establish the  project. Our attorneys were McAfee and Taft. I don   t know much about  attorneys until I started this project and realized they   re the largest firm  in the region. They have, like, four hundred attorneys. They liked the  idea well enough to do the preliminary work and get paid on the back  end.  People go,    Well, you haven   t done that. What   d you do in nine years?     According to Benham and our financial people, we   ve spent nearly four  million dollars. My wife really does love me because we spent our 401k  for the project. We went to the wall on it. I can look back and say,    We  bet it all to get it done.    There were times where I would   ve said,    It   s  not worth it,    because I was lied to a bunch. It just really bothered me  that people would behave that way. Why do that? There was no point in  24  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  doing that. I thought,    If it wasn   t that I got my friends involved in this  project, I would   ve walked away,    but I   d already got them involved     You had a team.     and people were relying on it. I persevered and followed through.  There was never any question we wouldn   t finish it. It was always going  to happen. It was just,    Win.    It   s funny. Being a half-breed, I   ve seen it  all, racism on both sides of the card. I won   t mention an individual   s  name, but a very strong influence in Tulsa said,    We don   t want a  blanking Indian representing the city.    I had to laugh to myself. First of  all, who are    we   , (Laughs) and fortunately, you don   t have the say. You  don   t have the say whether or not. I was told certain things were said and  done to hope that I went away, and that didn   t happen. That told me the  project was meant to be. Now it   s my job to make it perfect. You know,  perfection   s hard to nail down. I don   t know anybody that   s done it yet,  but you can get close.  What is your creative process once you get an idea?  I have the attention span of a gnat. I do understand what it takes to get  focused and stay on task until you   ve got it done, but then I have to  move on. This piece was unusual for the fact that it was originally  designed to be two hundred feet up but only twenty-five feet tall. This  leg, bent, looking straight on at it looks awkward. When you hold it up  and look at it from a distance, it looks right, and people don   t see that.  There   s some angles on him that just don   t look right, but if you put him  on the roof, he looks right, which sounds kind of weird but   . (Laughs)  And he   s going to be on a hill.  He   ll be on a hill, but he   s so big. He   s twenty-one stories, so we don   t  have to worry about making his head bigger. We just need to make him  as perfectly   . There again, what   s pleasing to me may not be pleasing  to someone else. My dad looked like the Indian on the nickel, and that   s  kind of how I envision him, though that is not the 150 faces that have  been sent to me in the mail to use.    This is the perfect Native  American.    I did this preliminary. Somebody thought it was Chief Gray  because my dad and my cousin, Bud   s boy, look a lot alike. They go,     You   re going to make it look like Chief Gray?    I mean, they were upset  about that. (Laughter)    No. I assure you, that   s not Chief Gray.     That was another thing that kind of hurt the project early on, and I   m not  ashamed to say this. I have a story for you. I had three or four chiefs  telling me they were behind the project and loved the project and when  I   m ready to go, they   re ready to help, but once it ended up in Osage  25  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  County (I   m an Osage artist, and the Osages still may be involved  somewhat) they just said they couldn   t sell it politically, that they  couldn   t justify giving money to an Osage project. I said,    But it isn   t.  That   s why it   s a non-tribal   .     Indian image.  I go back to the story my dad told me once about Osages. He said there  were these three buckets, and they have crabs in them, but the one  bucket   s full of Osage crabs. Have you heard this?  I   ve heard a version. (Laughs)  The fishermen come back in the morning. Two buckets are empty, but  the Osage bucket is still full. The one fisherman asks the older one,     Why is it these other crabs get out, and this center bucket stays full?     He said,    Well, those are Osage crabs. When one starts to crawl out, the  others pull him back down.    (Laughter)  How about your creative routine? Do you work at night or in the  morning? What   s your routine?  Oh my gosh. Normally I   d work late at night and into the wee hours  because of being a one-man operation. Shirley and I used to talk about  this. Answering the phone during the day to conduct business is very  difficult, but that   s when the business world works, so you   re always  having to entertain that. The thing I miss most, (and I enjoy having  young artists around) you kind of feed off the energy, and you don   t  have that when you work solitary. When I worked at the ad agency,  there were six other artists there. I had to tell myself,    Go to art  exhibitions. Go to galleries. Get charged up.    Otherwise, you   re just left  to your own devices, and it can be very tedious.  You renew yourself that way. Looking back over your career, what was  a fork-in-the-road moment when you could   ve gone one way but chose to  go another? You might have mentioned it already.  I mentioned the part about wanting to be a homicide detective and a film  director. That part about the accident, that was a big fork in the road  because I love sports, as I indicated earlier. I don   t know if I indicated it  or not. We talked about it. I could no longer do the physical things for a  couple of years, and that was tough, but I could use my left hand, so  drawing was easy.  What would you say has been one of the high points of your career?  26  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  I think the individuals I meet and what a small world it is, such a small  world. I still have a hard time with politicians. I think it   s the faces they  wear that kind of make things different.  What has been one of the low points of your career so far?  Did I mention the politicians, the different faces they wear? (Laughter)  I   m not sure there are any low points other than the part about being told  one thing and that person had no concept at all what they were saying.  Or they knew, and they just didn   t care. How can I gripe? I get to do  things that other people dream about doing. In fact, the other day I was  at a motorcycle shop a buddy of mine owns. I thought,    Man, it would  be fun just to work on bikes all day.    After about fifteen minutes of  thinking that, I went,    What am I talking about? I get to sculpt and just  sculpt  I can make a motorcycle if I want.     Is there anything we   ve forgotten to talk about or that you   d like to add  before we take a look at The American and Shannon?  As I told you earlier, I hate boring people so I don   t feel comfortable  going into   . I didn   t realize what a big thing this monument meant to  so many thousands of people. We still get letters from people that want  to know the status and is there anything they can do to help. They want  it done. That   s another thing that   s given me a lot of energy to go ahead  and see the race through and, therefore, another reason why it needs to  be perfect, because it will be around a long, long time. That didn   t  answer your question, though, did it?  It did. That   s so neat to hear people are responding that way. Okay,  we   re looking at The American from another angle, here. We could see  it in the background earlier. You were explaining to me the number of  pieces that it   s going to have to be cast in.  There   s over 3,600 four-and-a-half-foot-by-four-and-a-half-foot bronze  plates. There   s a special software that allows us to mill each plate to  one-thousandth of an inch accuracy. The scanning process wasn   t even  available to do this nine years ago when we started. Roger and Allen  down in Norman were doing the same software (and there   s a word they  use for when you write software) that they   re doing in London for this  600-foot Buddha they   re doing in India. They   re having to go to London  to have their software done. Roger and Allen were ahead of the curve a  year prior to that.  That   s incredible.  We had some wonderful people involved in the project.  27  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Little Thunder  Gray  Okay, we   ve got Shannon in view. I love that look of concentration on  her face.  Thanks.  Anything you want to add? You can see the measurements that you   ve  written on there.  Yes, everything had to be up to scale. Interesting enough, it was the first  large-scale monument I did, and it was also the very last of the old  techniques, done with plaster, chicken wire, foam block, the old white  foam for filler. You   ll hear me use other terms about foam, and it   s a  completely different method where they have these huge DuPont-made  foam blocks that the milling machine will come in and   . You could  actually carve them with hand, or the milling machine can come in and  scan your smaller maquette and come in and give you a rough-out. It  saves you a huge amount in clay.  Wow. That   s really interesting.  It really is. There again, economics. For my young students, I   ll tell  them,    I didn   t think math was that important, or English.    One, you  have to be able to communicate your ideas. If you are going to ask  someone for  100,000 for a project, you   ve got to be able to  communicate, and usually it   s in a written form that you have to do that.  That   s why you want to learn English. Then you want to go to the math  part because you better figure out how much the project   s going to cost.  There are too many artists    skulls and skeletons out there. There   s one  big piece here in Oklahoma that they didn   t do their math and they got  behind the eight ball on it. That   s a classic example of an artist going,     This cost this much, and that cost that much, and I   ll just multiply it by  ten     Then realizing,    Well, I left out that part. I should   ve multiplied it  by twenty.    (Laughter)  Right. Well, thank you very much for your time today, Shan.  Well, I hope I don   t bore anybody. It   s interesting. I like doing it. At the  same time, I don   t. I really don   t. It   s kind of weird. It   s a love-hate  thing, but the positives far outweigh the negatives.  -------  -------
