 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, November  8, 2012, and I   m interviewing Kickapoo bead artist Judy Coser for the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at  Judy   s home in Mounds, Oklahoma. Judy, you   ve won a number of  awards in beadwork and cultural items, and your works are in the  permanent collection of several Oklahoma museums, including  Philbrook and Gilcrease. You also make traditional clothing and have  taught workshops in a number of areas. Thank you for taking the time to  speak with me.  It   s a pleasure.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, and I grew up in and around Shawnee.  What did your dad do for a living?  He was a leather craftsman.  As I remember, your grandparents on both sides were gone when you  were growing up, but you learned a lot about Kickapoo ways. Besides  your dad, were there any other extended family members important to  you growing up?  My great-uncle and his wife. My great-grandmother. We had an older  cousin, my dad   s niece, and that   s about it.  Did you grow up speaking your language?  5  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  No.  But you were exposed to your dad   s leather work?  Yes.  How did that impact you as a child?  Well, he was gone a lot because he had to go where the work was. When  we lived in Shawnee for the first four years of my life, he didn   t really  do much work at home. It was after, when we moved to the country near  McCloud, he had all his tools, and he had a huge granite rock that he did  his stamping on. It was there that I noticed that he could sit for the  longest time and work.  You know, you   re a kid going in and out of the house, and you just don   t  even think about things like that. It was later that I realized that while he  was working on his stuff, he would sing. He would sing to himself, and I  think that   s where I got that. It   s not that I sing to myself when I   m  working. (Laughter) It   s just that you can do a lot of thinking when  you   re working with your hands.  Did you have any family members around you who beaded growing up?  No.  What about, like, art classes at school? Did you get to take any art  classes when you were in elementary or junior high?  Well, not that kind of art classes. I mean, they let us draw, and I always  enjoyed that. It wasn   t until I got into college that I was able to take  drawing classes.  Let   s see, you went to college where?  St. Gregory   s  University , one semester at OCU  Oklahoma City  University , and I graduated from OU.  What was your reaction when you got to take those first art classes?  I liked it.  Was it drawing or drawing and painting?  It was charcoal. That   s all I remember. It was charcoal, and I just really  enjoyed it.  6  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  When did you start becoming interested in beadwork?  When I was about twelve years old my great-aunt gave me a loom, and I  slowly started acquiring beads and learned different techniques. We used  to go to this  Religious Society of  Friends church, and every summer  they would send us to this camp up there in northeast Oklahoma. There  was a lady up there. She taught us how to make beaded medallions.  Well, I was watching the others do it, and I listened to her. These other  girls that were in that little group were having a hard time, so I just  explained to them what they were supposed to be doing. I wasn   t  actually doing the beading. I just explained to them. They looked at me  really odd, wondering how come I knew when I wasn   t working on  anything.  Anyway, that was my first experience with that. Over the years, I   ve just  looked at things and wondered how they were made. A lot of people say  that they can   t learn techniques from books. Well, I can, (Laughter)  which is kind of unusual. I don   t know. It   s just always come natural to  me.  I was wondering, did you do a couple of pieces on your loom, too, as  you got the beads that you needed?  Yes, I liked that in the beginning, but after so many years I got burned  out with that. So I don   t hardly do any loom work now.  A lot of young women will get into making earrings for extra money or  things like that. They   ll do that for a while, and then they won   t really  bead after that. What prompted you to continue your beadwork?  Well, we lived out in the country, and for the longest time our only  means of transportation was to go to school by school bus. Then we  went to this Friends church  the Kickapoo Friends Center, a mission run  by the Religious Society of Friends , like I said, and they would come  pick us up on Sunday. So that was another way to go someplace. Unless  my great-uncle came for us, we didn   t go anywhere. We lived in a  crowded house, and other than school and going to church once a week,  there really wasn   t a whole lot to do. It kind of gave me something to do.  It wasn   t until I was in junior high that the people that were at the church  changed, and they got a couple in there. They were interested in  everything about the tribe or the people that were from the tribe that  would go to that church. They started buying beadwork, and they were  interested in my stuff, so it gave me a little spending money.  7  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Right.  Not that I had any place to go spend it  (Laughter)  I think dancing   s been important to you for a long time. Were you also  starting to powwow dance a little bit in your teens?  Yes, I think I got my love of dancing from my great-grandmother. She  was dancing for years and years and years. I think that if she hadn   t  fallen and broken her hip when she did, she probably would   ve danced  until the day she died.  And also, you   re a jingle dress dancer. Did you dance competitively for  a while?  Yes. (Laughter)  Did you make your own clothing and your beadwork and stuff?  Yes, yes. Everything.  I was kind of wondering if when people saw your beadwork, your  clothing, if that spurred requests for,    Could you do something for me?  Could you make me a dress?     Well, I was very selective in who I made dresses for. For one thing, the  material for all of it was very expensive, so, like I said, I was very  selective in whoever I made dresses for. As far as the things like the  moccasins and the leggings, you know, that was even more expensive,  and I just didn   t want to do that.  Of course, the sewing part requires a sewing machine. When did you  first get access to a sewing machine?  Before or after I got married? (Laughter)  I guess before you got married.  There was an old treadle sewing machine that we had.  At the house?  Yes, my great-grandmother had one, and we had one, so that   s where I  learned how to sew. Then we were required   I think when I was a  freshman in high school, we were required to take home ec, and I was  introduced to an electric sewing machine. I didn   t like it as much as I did  8  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  that little treadle. (Laughter)  Why not?  I don   t know. It just seemed like you had more control.  I don   t know if you ever set up at powwows and sell beadwork. I don   t  know if you did that, as well. Did you do a little bit of that?  I think I was, like, a freshman in high school, and there was a group of  other, I guess, bead craftsman and people that did arts and crafts from  the Native population in Shawnee. We got involved with them, and they  put on a craft show. That was a lot of fun. I don   t remember if I sold  anything or not, but it was fun. Gosh, that was a long time ago   (Laughter)  What was fun about it?  Just seeing what everybody else was doing.  Being around people and showing your work. There weren   t any little  Indian stores or gift shops in town that you would occasionally sell to?  No.  You did go to Northeastern State  University  then for a while, didn   t  you?  Well, after I got out of OU, I got into a graduate program there, but I  didn   t like it.  Talk to me a little bit about being at OU. You had taken some art  classes, I guess, previously. Did you take any more at OU?  I took a life drawing class.  And what was your major?  Political science. (Laughter)  What didn   t you like about the NSU program?  I just didn   t like being over in that area.  When and where did you meet George, your husband, George Coser?  9  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Well, it was, I want to say about 19   it was in the    70s. There used to be  this powwow in Shawnee. My parents, especially my dad, he never  let  us  stay after the powwow was over because of the things that went on.  My cousins, they lived in Shawnee, but they camped out at that  powwow. Anyway, she got her mother to ask my dad if I could spend  the night with her. He said okay, and I was shocked. (Laughter)  We were walking around after the powwow, and she had run into some  people that she knew, and so she was talking and visiting with them. I   m  standing there and didn   t really know anybody, so I   m just standing  there and watching everything that was going on. Pretty soon, I saw this  guy making a beeline for her. He just stood out because   I know people  wore hats, but he had this big straw hat on, cowboy hat.  Anyway, he went over to her, and then pretty soon she was really  laughing, and he just kept   I guess he was teasing her. Then after a  while, he moved on. She came over to where I was, and I asked her,     Who was that guy?    She said,    Oh, that was George Coser. He   s  always after me.    (Laughter)  What was weird was there   s a state park in Illinois called Kickapoo State  Park, and they were having some kind of celebration. I think this is 19     I want to say    72 or    73. Anyway, I was part of a group that went up  there for that, and George was one of the singers. I had no idea.  Saw him again. (Laughs)  No, I didn   t even know he was there  It wasn   t until after we were  married we were talking about things we   d done. He told me, and I had  no idea he   d been there.  Had he spotted you, though?  I doubt it. (Laughter) I was still in high school, and I guess he was in  college.  When you two got together seriously and got married, when did that  happen?  In 1989.  Had you undertaken a really large beading project prior to that?  No.  So what was your first really major piece?  10  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Fully-beaded leggings, a belt and hair ties and a barrette for myself.  Everything was based on a pair of moccasins that had been made for me.  Were there any special challenges in doing that?  Accumulating the beads because I had no idea how much it was going to  take for the background. I just knew that   s what I wanted to do was have  everything based on those moccasins, and I did it.  How long did it take?  I want to say about a year.  I bet they were beautiful. When did you begin entering your bead art in  competitive shows?  I want to say 1994.  What was one of the first shows that you entered?  Red Earth.  Can you describe a little bit what that was like to enter your first  competitive show and what you entered?  Well, I told George that was what I wanted to do, and he supported me,  so that   s what I did. As far as entering work competitively, I hadn   t  really thought about it. I had some beaded moccasin flaps for a pair of  Kickapoo moccasins. I didn   t have the actual moccasin that they go on,  but I entered the flaps, and I got second place.  They have a little prize money with that, too. What was interesting about  that show for you, that first show?  It was something I hadn   t tried.  As you began entering other shows, who were some of the bead artists  whose work stood out for you?  Well, I went back the next year and entered, and I won first place, I  think two items or something. I   m one of these people where I set a goal  for myself, and when I reach that goal, I don   t have to do that anymore.  Then I can move on to something else. Well, I did that. I accomplished  what I set out for myself, so I stopped entering competitions after that.  11  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  You   d won second and first. Were there a lot of beadwork entries at that  time?  I don   t remember.  I   m thinking there weren   t as many as now. What do you think is the  difference between bead art and bead craft, or is there a difference?  Well, it just depends on what kind of item you   re talking about. I mean, I  like to do traditional things, things that people might use in ceremonies,  people that want to wear their traditional regalia. I   m not just talking  about for powwows. I think I stopped doing arts and crafts a long time  ago.  Because you and George were both active on the powwow scene, you  traveled out of state quite a bit. Were there places out of state that you  took your bead art to sell?  No. Never, never, never. We went up to Wisconsin several times, and  when I   m up there, all I want to do is dance.  Are you watching beadwork patterns and styles up there, too?  Yes.  I think you told me once that the Kickapoo and the Ho-Chunk were  closely related.  We   re all Great Lakes people, kind of from that area.  So what are some of the other rewards of going up north like that?  The forest, the trees. To me, it   s almost like going home.  One of your early major works that I remember was the otterskin bag  that   s currently owned by Philbrook. Can you talk about that bag, how  you got the initial idea to do that?  My great-grandfather was a full-blood Sac and Fox. From what I  understand, he was in the Midewiwin Society. He was, like, the tenth  level, and that   s really important. To me, it was just to honor him.  Can you explain just a bit about the Midewiwin Society?  No, all I know is that it died out in the    30s.  12  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  What kinds of research did you do for the bag?  I looked at other bags, and I saw a design that I wanted to try. I didn   t  realize how difficult it was until I started working on it, but I challenged  myself, and I got it done. There were some people that saw it, and they  thought I did it on a loom. There   s no way you can get that design on a  loom. Every line of that beadwork, you had to do it row by row, and  beads had to match up for that design. And I did it.  It   s an amazing piece of work. When you say that you did some research,  was it, like, book research, or did you travel anyplace, too, or go to  museums?  A lot of book research.  Okay. What about bandolier bags? When did you become interested in  trying one of those?  For my tribe or for George   s?  I guess your first   let   s talk about your first one first.  Okay. Well, George is Muscogee, and they wear bandolier bags, but  theirs are different from the Great Lakes area. I was told somebody was  interested in that, and, anyway, I researched designs and figured out how  they were made. It   s not like there   s patterns out there for you to follow  or anything, so that   s what I did. I figured out what designs I wanted,  and I gathered the material. It   s expensive. I mean, the wool alone was  like seventy-five dollars a yard.  It   s trade cloth we   re talking about?  Yes, yes. And so, I did it. Of course, I didn   t know how it was going to  turn out because I had never sewn on wool before, but it turned out  pretty good.  It   s a beautiful bag, too. Can you talk about a few of the differences (and  maybe this will bring up your second bag) between Great Lakes-style  and Muscogee-style bags?  They bead their designs, but they don   t fill in the background. Great  Lakes style, you bead your design, but you fill in the background.  There   s beadwork on the strap on both of them, but the background is  not filled in for the Muscogees. It   s kind of like the actual pocket that  you can put things in, it   s a lot bigger. The Muscogee, they have, I guess  you   d call them tassels. The Great Lakes, a lot of times theirs are loom  13  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  beaded. I think you just have to see so you could see the difference.  It seems to me that you weren   t seeing a lot of bandolier bags outside of  museums when you started doing them, and you do see, not a whole  bunch, but you see bead workers doing a number of bags these days.  Had you seen any in competitions, or had you seen any bead workers  working on bags before you did that first one?  No, not before I did the first one. They   re mostly things like you might  see in a museum or in books about beadwork or bead art. That   s where I  got my ideas. I know a long time ago those designs had meaning. While  I wouldn   t want to go and do somebody else   s tribal work, I felt like,     I   m married to George, and so I can do this.    That   s why I did it.  When people saw George   s bag, there was a positive reaction, wasn   t  there?  Oh, he   s never had the bag. The reason why I did that was to honor his  tribe because I   m married to him. Gilcrease was interested in it, and so  he took it over there because he   s my agent. He showed them and talked  to them and everything, and they bought it.  Yes, I meant to say when other Muscogee Creeks saw that bag, they  responded positively to seeing a bandolier bag that was Muscogee style.  When did you make your first pair of moccasins?  What kind? (Laughter)  Kickapoo moccasins. Go ahead and talk about that.  It had to be in the early    90s because they use smoked, brain-tanned deer  hide, and those are hard to come by. I think I had used some of my prize  money to buy some hide, and so made my own pair. But I did, I had a  pair that one of my cousins had made. She was a really older lady. She  was famous for her work, or for her moccasins anyway, among the tribe.  I had a pair of hers, and what I ended up doing was, since she wasn   t  around to show me, I took it apart, and I figured it out. That   s how I  learned to make my own moccasins.  And then you learned how to make Creek-style moccasins, too?  It   s not much difference. (Laughter)  I remember you gave a workshop, didn   t you?  No.  14  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Oh, you didn   t. Okay.  But a few years ago, Glenpool schools, one of their Native Creek classes  wanted   the teacher asked me if I could teach her kids. I went over  there, and I tried. I   m not a teacher. That   s all I can say is I   m not a  teacher. You know, either they got it, or they didn   t. From some of the  ones that I saw, they didn   t get it. (Laughter)  Of the commissions you   ve had, what posed the greatest challenge?  I find it very inhibiting. I don   t like having a deadline, and I don   t like  having to   something very, very specific, it   s just   I don   t know. It  kind of zaps my creativity. I knew a lot of times,    I   ve got to get this  done,    and it   s just really hard sometimes.  But I do remember times when you   ve had both clothing and beadwork  that you were working on simultaneously for somebody. Would you  switch off quite a bit to help yourself get through that?  Yes, breaks the monotony.  Yes, time-consuming work. What   s one of the most exciting places  you   ve traveled, either maybe as part of research for your art or just as  part of a cultural kind of exchange?  We went to Chicago on our way to Wisconsin once, and I got to stop in  the  Field  Museum there and see a lot of incredible things. We stopped  in Milwaukee and got to go to a museum there and got to go see a lot of  incredible things.  Wow, and a lot of woodland, probably. What was the thing that was  most moving for you there?  In Chicago there was a, they called it dried squash, but it was pumpkin,  field pumpkin. I saw that, and it just about made me cry. My dad used to  do that, and dried pumpkin is a way to   this is before refrigerators or  whatever. When you dry it, that thing can last for years and years. It was  really obvious to me that even though it was under glass, there   s no  telling how old that thing was. Anyway, we   re still doing that.  I think you and George made a trip to Germany. Can you talk about that  a little?  That was a long flight  (Laughter) Oh, I don   t think I   ll ever want to do  that again. We stayed with a nice couple, and I enjoyed myself around  15  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  them and everything. It was really kind of eye-opening to me.  Probably should explain how you ended up going.  Well, it was to Tulsa   s Sister City, Celle, Germany. They had something  going on. Originally started out they wanted a dance troupe of fifteen.  Well, it eventually just dwindled down to George and I. There was the  SARS scare, and just a lot of stuff that was going on. So, anyway, we  went, and part of the thing that we did, we went to a kindergarten. We  went to, like, a grade school and talked to the kindergarten kids and did  a little exhibition for them, and we got them to dance. Then we went to  the grade school and just answered questions. Then for part of Tulsa   s  thing, I guess every day a different sister city would be showcased, so  when it was Tulsa   s turn, we were part of the exhibition. He took a hand  drum, and he sang, and I danced. (Laughter)  That   s a neat experience. I know beaded collars have been around for a  long time, but it seems to me that when you started doing beaded collars,  they were some of the first collars that I saw at art galleries. So, again, I  think you   re always ahead of the curve with some of these things. Can  you talk a little bit about the collars and what you try to do with yours to  make them stand out a little bit?  I incorporated a design in there. That   s hard. And I came up with my  own way of how   I kind of figured out how that design is going to  come out and everything. That   s really, really intensive concentration,  and I don   t think I will ever want to do that design again. (Laughter)  How many did you end up making in all?  Two or three.  I know the Indian education program in Glenpool has also called on you  for different cultural workshops. One of the ones that you did was to  show them how to dry pumpkin, so could you talk about that experience  a bit?  Well, the Creeks used pumpkins. When I told Christie  NASA sponsor-  Indian Education    she called over here one time, and she wanted to  know what I was doing. I was telling her, and she was really interested.  Then she wanted to know if I could come do that for her class.  Usually what we do when those field pumpkins are ready   it used to be  you could do that in October, and she was calling me maybe a week or  two before Thanksgiving. Sometimes it   s hard to find those things, or  sometimes they   re overripe. Anyway, I went over there, and I tried to  16  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  show her, but     And she went and got the pumpkins, I guess?  Yes. To me, it   s one of these things where it   s actually a quiet activity. I  mean, you can   t have a lot of people around there talking. You can   t  have a lot of distractions and everything because you   re working with  knives. You have to concentrate on making your pumpkin rings, and  they go in a certain order, and just a whole lot of things. When we did it  at the school, oh man, that was something else. (Laughs)  But nobody lost a finger or anything, it turned out.  No, but I got several cuts on my hands. (Laughter)  You and George were selected as Native Elders of the Year by AARP     Yes, AARP.     here in Oklahoma in 2012. Can you tell us a little bit about that  experience?  Well, this friend of mine, when I had talked to her, she told me that she  was going to nominate us. I went,    Okay.    A little bit later she called,  and she was asking about different dates and some of the things that we  had done. I tried to fill her in and everything, and then I forgot about it  because we had different things that were going on.  Then he got a call back in September, and he thought that they were  joking. He didn   t know they were serious. They told us when they  wanted us   they had a banquet at the Cowboy Hall of Fame, and they  told us when they wanted us to be up there and everything because we  had been selected. It never dawned on me that I would be selected  because I don   t think of myself as an elder because I   m not sixty yet.  (Laughter) Plus, I feel like there   s probably a lot more people more  worthy than me. (Laughs) But anyway, we went, and it was different.  And wore your traditional clothing.  Yes.  We   re going to see some of that and the pumpkin at the end of the  interview. You were also extras in at least one movie. Has it been more  than one? (Laughter)  Well, it started out for that. Charlie Soap is making this movie about the  17  Little Thunder  Coser  Bell  Oklahoma  community, and it   s called The Cherokee Word for  Water. There   s a powwow scene in there. This friend of mine called me  up and wanted to know if I had something that her cousin could wear,  and I told her,    Sure,    because I thought,    Well, now this is another  thing that I can add to my list, that my work was in a movie.     That friend of mine had given me a Crow dress because she   s Crow and  Cherokee, and I kind of changed it around. There were some other  things that I wanted to do to it, but it   I guess her cousin was probably  about as tall as or taller than me. I sent my stuff down there, and I  thought that was it. I was happy that I could say my work was in a  movie.  She called back, and she said that she wanted to know if I wanted to be  in it, George and I. I told her,    Well, I hadn   t thought about it.    I told  her, I said,    I don   t really have anything to wear because your cousin has  everything that   s mine.    I found something, and then we got in, and  something happened with the car. I called up this other friend of mine  and asked her,    Hey, do you want to be in a movie?    (Laughter) She  said she hadn   t thought about it, but she wasn   t working at the time, so  she said,    Okay.    So I told her, and we rode down with her, and so then  we went. The thing was, they said it was a closed set and her name  wasn   t on the list, but we got her in anyway.  They did the powwow scene, and I never realized how long it takes to do  stuff like that. It   s in October, and down there in Tahlequah, when the  sun goes down, it does get cold in the evening. She wore an outfit that I  had given her. All I know is that Charlie was there, and I didn   t realize  that he still had this beadwork that I had made. Somebody had asked me  back in the    80s if I could fix a belt, a harness, a headband   I think that  was all. They were specific colors and specific designs, so I came up  with something. I don   t remember how much I got paid, but I did it all.  The guy that plays Charlie in the movie is wearing his outfit.  I was really kind of shocked. I said,    Whoa, it still looks good      (Laughter) Either that or he really took care of it. During one of the, like,  small breaks, I got up, and I went over there. I touched Charlie on the  arm, and I told him, I said,    I made your beadwork.    He turned around,  and he looked at me, and he was surprised. He said,    Really?    I said,     Yes.    I told him who the lady was that had asked me to do all that work  and everything. He said,    Well, you know, it was so weird. I would get  pieces in the mail every so often.    I told him,    Yes, I did most of it.     They were presents from her.  Yes.  18  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  She ordered them for him.  Yes.  Wow  (Laughs)  In addition to the work that my friend   s cousin has on, if she   s in there,  then my work will be in the movie because it   s Charlie   s.  Right. I understand they   re going to preview that pretty soon.  Yes, I think it   s November 29.  At the Circle Cinema?  No, Jazz Hall of Fame.  Jazz Hall of Fame. Bead art never seems to command the money it  deserves for the time that goes into it. Do you see that situation  improving?  In this economy? (Laughter) No.  I know both you and George have made important contributions to the  Native society. George has been a drug and alcohol counselor for many  years, but since he   s retired it   s tough at times, I imagine. What carries  you through?  The fact that I have tremendous patience. (Laughter) I don   t know. I  think as you get older you think,    Is this really something that we want,  or is it something that we think we need?    I   ve found that it   s pretty easy  to live simply.  I   d like to talk a little about your artistic techniques and process. You   ve  mentioned that after a while you just weren   t interested in loom work, so  you really didn   t do too much of that. On the different bandolier bags,  were you using an embossed stitch, or what kind of stitch were you  using?  I guess they call it an appliqu   stitch. Some people can use one needle  and do fine. I use two.  Oh, okay. It was interesting, you said that when you got your prize  money you went and got supplies. I think that   s artists    favorite thing.  When you get to go shopping for beads, what do you look for?  19  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Well, I guess you should be aware that about five years ago I had a  stroke. I can   t bead the way that I used to. There   s some things that I can  do, and what   s weird is I   ve found that I can do weaving really good.  Anyway, the days of me actually doing appliqu   work, I think that   s  pretty much over. I   ve tried, and I   ve tried, and I   ve tried, and it just  doesn   t come out the way that I want it to. I   m moving into a different  direction now. Now, there   s some weaving techniques that I really want  to try. It   s just that other things keep coming up and coming up and  coming up, so it   s kind of hard to get around to that.  Like sashes? You   re talking about weaving, or talking about looms?  No, there   s certain techniques you can do with beads.  Oh, okay. That   ll be great. I look forward to seeing what you do. Have  you worked with antique beads a lot on earlier works?  Yes, except that I don   t really like them because they   re not uniform.  When you did have commissions that were real specific about designs  and colors, how did you put your imprint on those so that you could still  know it was your work?  Well, the way that I see anything that I make, it starts up here, and it  comes out here. (Gestures) The thoughts that go through my mind when  I   m working on something are things that   the way that I feel when I   m  going through that, it   s mine all the way up until the end. When it   s  finished, it   s not mine anymore. If it pleases whoever I made it for,  that   s good. To me, that   s the most important part is the final product. I  can be pleased with it, but it   s for who it   s for. If they   re pleased with it,  okay, I did my job.  Do you ever sketch out your designs?  Once in a while.  If it   s particularly complicated. How about on the bag, the otterskin  bag?  I think there was a picture in a book, and that   s where I got the idea  from. I just went by the picture.  Do you think your colors, your palette, changed much over the years?  I don   t use as many graduated colors anymore. I like to see   it   s kind of  20  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  like a challenge to see what   s going to go good together and everything.  You sort of talked about your creative process a little. I wonder if there   s  anything you can add to that. Like when you get an idea for a piece, do  you ever write ideas down?  It wouldn   t do any good. (Laughter)  What happens after you get the idea?  Gather the materials, figure out how big or whatever, and just sit down  and do it.  Do you like working to music or anything, television or     I like it when it   s quiet.  What   s your creative routine? Do you try to work at night or during the  day, or just when you feel like it, or a few hours each day? What   s the  routine?  Any time after three o   clock, three o   clock in the afternoon. That   s when  I   m most   I   m not a morning person.  Looking back on your career so far, what   s been one of the high points?  Finishing that Great Lakes bandolier bag.  Yes. What did you do? Sometimes your adrenaline is still flowing. Did  you and George just enjoy the moment for an evening or something?  How did you feel when you finished it? Such a long process  (Laughter)  I told him, I said,    It   s like giving birth.    Of course, it took a little over a  year, but I got it done. It   s just that something that big, it kind of took on  a life of its own. If I wasn   t in the proper mood, it would let me know  because all kinds of mistakes would happen, and I   d get frustrated, so  I   d just put it down, and then I   d have to come back to it later.  You had to do some tearing out sometimes.  Yes.  Wow. What   s been one of the low points of your career so far?  That bag hasn   t sold     21  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  The one that we   re going to see today.     but that   s okay.  And you know what its value is. You know what price you   ve put on it,  and you won   t let it go for less than it   s worth.  Well, you can   t get it at Wal-Mart, and if everybody could make them,  then why don   t I see more of them?  What would you tell a young Native person who   s interested in earning  their living with beadwork, bead art?  Just be prepared. Things won   t always sell. You can follow the trends or  you can   I don   t know. I always felt kind of weird if I try to do some  other tribe without their permission. Now, this friend of mine, she   s  Cherokee, and she   s Crow. She asked me to do her beadwork, and so I  did. But the thing was I had her permission. I fixed her some Crow  moccasins, Crow leggings, just things that went along with her outfits to  wear at powwows.  As far as me actually wanting to do anymore Crow designs after that, I  wouldn   t do it because that   s not who I am. It   s just   I don   t know. I  think what I   m seeing now is a lot of people, they like to follow these  trends. I   m not into that. I just want to do what I want to do.  Is there anything else you   d like to add or talk about before we look at  your work?  Just that it   s   I can   t bead like I used to. It   s kind of hard when you   as  I   m getting older, I guess it   s arthritis setting in and my eyesight. Plus,  it   s hard to sit for a long time. (Laughter)  But you   re thinking about doing some weaving, bead weaving, so we   ll  look forward to that. All right, can you talk to us about your clothes  here?  This is an appliqu   design skirt. My great-grandmother, she always wore  a black shirt with her outfits, and so this is a black shirt. Then we have  the silver buttons on there, a bone and glass-bead necklace. This is kind  of a combination of Kickapoo and Sac and Fox because that   s who I am.  Beautiful. All right, how about this bandolier bag?  This was done on red trade wool. Most of them are done on red and  black, but this is red. This is all cut beads except for a few sections of  22  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  Little Thunder  Coser  white heart glass beads. The designs come from the Great Lakes.  And there are the tassels.  Those are loom-woven tassels.  It   s just exquisite, beautiful, flat, straight work. Okay, how about this?  Okay, this is a man   s shirt. This was an old piece of beadwork. I think  this was from some of the things that my great-grandmother had, and I  took it apart, and I restored it. This is how the piece would go on the  shirt, and this was for ceremonial purposes.  It   s a really beautiful design. Judy, thank you for your time today.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
