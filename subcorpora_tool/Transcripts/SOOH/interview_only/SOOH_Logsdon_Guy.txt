 Larson, and I   m here today with Dr. Guy Logsdon.  It   s January 25, 2013, and we   re here in his home in Tulsa. I   d like to  start with a few general biographical questions if that   s okay with you?  Okay.  Could you tell me a little about your family and where you were raised?  If you   ve got two hours. I am Guy William Logsdon. I was the fifth of  five children born to my mother and father. I had three older sisters, one  older brother. He was two years older, so the three oldest in the family  were girls, and then two boys. My daddy was from Texas and born north  of Sulphur Springs in a little community. I don   t think it was even a  community, an area where they had a few families. He was born in 1893  and was playing the fiddle by the time he was six years old. He was one  of twelve children born to my grandparents.  My grandfather on his side, on my daddy   s side, was born, oddly  enough, in 1845 in Indiana. In 1850, they moved to Texas. I grew up  knowing that my grandfather, who obviously I never knew, fought for  Texas during the Civil War and was wounded and apparently became  addicted to morphine or whatever it is that they used for painkiller in  those days. Then he went back to Indiana and got a degree at Indiana  University and went back to Texas to teach school. There, he met my  grandmother.  We knew her as Grandma. She   s the only grandparent I ever knew. She  was seventy-five years old when I was born, so    Grandma    is  appropriate. She was born 1861 in Texas. I think she was one of his  students. My mother has done a lot of genealogical work and has written  all of this down, but I have not gone through and memorized all of it yet.  Daddy was one of twelve children born to them. They buried seven of  5  Larson  Logsdon  Larson  Logsdon  their twelve children. None in childbirth, I might add.  In fact, I didn   t know this until many years later, and the way I learned it  is not worth taking the time. I did learn during the initial Land Run of  1889, they loaded up their wagon, children, and headed to make the  Land Run, but at Ardmore, their son (maybe a year old, I don   t know)  died. They stopped and buried him there in Ardmore and then went back  to Texas. That   s sort of the family background.  So your dad almost became an Oklahoman earlier.  Yes, but farmer, schoolteacher, you name it. Grandma used to get a  Texas Confederate Widow   s check, probably five dollars. I don   t know,  but I always wish that I had one of those, not for the money but for the  family history. Anyway, that   s a little. My daddy, 1893, came to  Oklahoma in 1912. He was nineteen years old. Said if he stayed in that  part of Texas he   d have to marry a cousin, and he did not want to marry  a cousin. This is going to jump ahead just a little bit, but when he left  coming up here, some of the relatives gave him a hard time, said,     You   re going to go up and marry one of those Indian squaws,    which in  those days, intermarriage of Indian and white was on the same level as  black and white intermarriage. Not trying to sound biased or anything,  I   m just talking about it.  When he married my mother many years later, he took her back to  Texas. He said,    Don   t you dare tell anyone you   re part Indian.     (Laughs) She used to tell that story. Anyway, came here in 1912. Did a  number of things. He was quite a musician and entertainer and used to  do some of the minstrel shows that traveled down around Texas. Used to  participate in some of those. I don   t know if he was drafted in this (I  never learned) or if he volunteered for World War I in Ada. I should say,  he came on to Ada, Oklahoma, where two brothers and a sister and then  another sister came up. So there were five of his family, five surviving,  and I knew them.  Do you know why Oklahoma, particularly?  No. I   ve always wondered why and have never been told, never learned  any reason. I think part of it, my grandma   s maiden name was Chapman,  1861. She used to say that Johnny Appleseed was a relative. She also  one day told me that Cynthia Ann Parker, the mother of Quanah Parker  was a Texas relative. I don   t know because I never traced it, but that was  her statement. Anyway, there was sort of an outlaw type who became a  deputy sheriff around the Ada area named Jonathan Chapman. No, not  Jonathan. I forget his first name. Andy Chapman, something like that.  I   m not so sure, but what maybe some of the Chapman family or some  6  of her relatives might have wound up in Indian territory because it was a  little more lax than some areas. (Laughs) I don   t know, but anyway, they  wound up here. That was before 1912.  One of his brothers, my uncle, was here by statehood in Ada. My  mother   well, I   ll finish about my daddy. He could dance and make  Fred Astaire look like an amateur. He was a tremendous entertainer. He  wasn   t tall. He was probably five seven, something like that. I don   t  think my old grandma, who had twelve children, was even five feet tall.  She was very small and never weighed a hundred pounds. He gave up  the entertainment in Ada. I shouldn   t say that. He did continue to fiddle  and do some entertaining. Sold life insurance once. My uncle was a life  insurance salesman, his older brother. I forget where they were. I think  Cromwell, somewhere over in that area. He used to tell the story that  they didn   t know what you were, if you were a thief or what. One night,  I think it was a bullet came up through the floor of the little place where  they were staying, so he resigned from the life. (Laughs)  There are all sorts of stories like that. I won   t get into all of them. My  mother was born in 1903 in the community that became known as  Yeager, Yeager, Oklahoma. Her mother died giving birth to her. Her  father was Thomas Marcellus. He was born in, I think, Georgia. Married  a woman, and she at some point said that she hated him and wished she  didn   t have his name. His name at that point was Mothershed. I think  there were a number of Mothersheds in the Cherokee Nation. He said,     I   ll change that.    He went to Texas and changed his name to his  mother   s maiden name, Marcellus.  I don   t know how he met my mother. My old grandma was a student of  my grandfather. There was about sixteen years difference in age,  something like that. How he met my grandmother, I don   t know. She  was from Wewoka, living there. Her name was Cherry. My mother grew  up in the Creek Nation among Creeks. I think she went to a number of  the programs growing up and all. In turn, I think when she saw the men  take a drink or two and then go out and throw up, that they   d been  drinking alcohol, not realizing it was a purgative to get rid of the sins.  That, she learned many years later. She decided she was not Creek. She  was, indeed, Cherokee. Her father was Cherokee, and he did refuse to  sign the  Dawes  Rolls.  I think that her mother had a little Creek heritage in her background  because the name Cherry in Wewoka may not have been Creek, but it  might have been Seminole. It was not Cherokee. Anyway, when my  daddy took my mother back to Texas (she used to tell this story) to meet  the cousins who said,    You   re going to Indian territory and marry a  squaw,    he said,    Don   t you dare tell anyone you   re part Indian.    He  7  didn   t want to   you didn   t have to tell. My mother, obviously, was of  American Indian heritage, and she was proud of it, very proud.  At the same time, one of the things that we know today and take for  granted   my old daddy, I guess in Ada, was going to East Central. At  that time, you could get your teaching certificate. I know that one time,  he had a furniture store. He and my mother had this furniture store when  I was born. People, not often, but I   d be somewhere   I was never an  employee or worked at the furniture store like my brother two years  older than I was. They   d say,    Is Professor Logsdon here?    I thought,        Professor Logsdon   ? What is this?    One day I found out that while he  was at East Central   this is after World War I because he was in the  service but got malaria and was in Florida but didn   t go overseas. That  was the season of killing, right and left, people dying constantly. He had  it but survived and may have been killed if he   d gone overseas. Who  knows?  Anyway, he was at East Central, and the president called him in. My  daddy had kind of a reputation in those days of being pretty tough. You  didn   t mess with him, even though he was small compared to many. The  president of East Central called him in and said,    We need a man to go  over to this school.    It was a school somewhere near Allen.    They   ve  had a lot of trouble, and we can   t keep a teacher there. We   ll give you  your teaching certificate if you   ll go over and take care of it.    Each  teacher in those days (it wasn   t just those that continued on) would  spend a week or a month with different families because they had no  place to live. This one family where he was staying, the wife and  children slept on the floor, and he had to sleep in bed with the husband  because they only had one bed and one room, you know. He said this  man kept a box of oranges under his bed and would reach under and take  some.    Want some, Professor?    He said,    I learned not to eat raisins.     (Laughter)  One of his stories was, one afternoon a man with a couple of sons came  in and said,    You kept my son in after school, and if you ever do that  again, I   m going to come up and beat the hell out of you.    My daddy  said he reached down his pocket, pulled out his knife and said,    Why  wait? Let   s do it now.    The man rode off, and never had any more  trouble in that community. That was my daddy. He knew how to play  the game. Mother, there in the Yeager area, (Yeager, for those who don   t  know, was about six miles northeast of Holdenville) she was bitten by a  rabid dog. I don   t know what age, maybe eight, ten, somewhere in there.  They finally found a doctor who had used his own dogs and animals and  things and had come up with a serum. They took her by train. I used to  think it was Fort Smith, but it may have been Oklahoma City. I don   t  8  know. I do have the story that she wrote out for me. Each day after she  was brought home   she didn   t like doctors. I know that much. She  would not let us have shots growing up. I had a  tetanus  shot once  because I had jumped off on a rusty rake and they were,    Well, who  knows. You   ve got to have the lockjaw.     Apparently eighteen shots, a long needle, in the stomach as a child, and  she never liked doctors from that point on. She had to go to a few. In  fact, before she died, I made her. I took her. Anyway, she said she got  home, and each afternoon after school and sometimes during school they  would walk the grade levels from the school. This was not a big school,  so I   m not talking big groups but down maybe a quarter of a mile from  where they lived. They would stand at the window, and each one waved  goodbye. When you grow up, as a child,    Bye, bye, it   s been nice  knowing you,    it was traumatic.  She became very religious. By that, I   m not saying evangelical or  anything like that but very spiritual is a better word. Her father, John  Marcellus, was a banker in Holdenville, and Yeager was a little  community on the railroad line. You get in and out on the railroad or by  horse or wagon, whatever. He died in 19   when he died, she was three.  He died in 1912, I think was the year. She grew up, basically, with no  mother and no father. He had remarried, and she had two step-sisters,  but her stories were somewhat like growing up with a stereotypical  stepmother. Mama Hagan we called her. Her father went to Texas to, I  think it was Sherman, Kidd-Key College. At that time, it was a private  school, Kidd-Key College, and, I think, for girls. She was nine, I think,  when he did this. He paid her tuition, paid everything to take care of her  education after the upper level at Yeager. I think that shows that he was  a pretty decent man.  She had no middle name. In fact, she had no name. Her mother   s name  was Mattie, so my mother became Little Mattie and became Mattie. At  Kidd-Key, the girls had to have a middle name, so he thought,    Okay,  Theresa.    He liked the name, so my mother became Mattie Theresa  Marcellus. I have never photographed it, but there is a building in  Holdenville, if my memory serves me. I don   t know if it   d be Main  Street, Broadway, or what, but it goes out north of town. It   s a duplex  building, yellow brick, and on the top, one side says    Chapman    and the  other side    Marcellus.    Well, that had to have been my grandfather.  What I like to think is that Chapman would be the wealthy Chapman oil  man because that   s where he got his start down there, in the Holdenville  area, but I   ve never gone back to prove it. I hope someday I   ll be able to  show that we should be getting part of that inheritance. That   s just part  of my sickness. (Laughter)  9  Larson  Logsdon  Anyway, that   s her background. She wound up teaching school in  Pottawatomie County, and I guess somewhere in there at East Central,  somewhere in there, she and my daddy met and then married. He, in  turn, with another brother   Uncle Claude was the oldest, Uncle  Clifford, the next, and then my daddy, Guy. We had Aunt Dolly who  was older than my daddy, and Aunt Lula who was younger than my  daddy. Those were the five Texas family members in Ada. Never fully  examined it, somehow he and my uncle Clifford put in a furniture store  in Ada. Eventually, down on Main Street, it was Logsdon Brothers  Furniture.  My uncle Clifford was an alcoholic. After World War II, it became  necessary for my daddy to buy him out. He said,    You either buy me out  or I   m buying you out.    Daddy bought him out, and it became just  Logsdon Furniture. The furniture business was his business. One of my  favorite stories after he died, which was 1957, I think   it was December  28. He died on our wedding anniversary. A man told me afterward, he  said,    You know, your daddy would go up to Chicago.    Every year  during the winter there was a big furniture festival program in Chicago,  and daddy would go up there every year. He said,    Last time I saw him  up there      when he told this, I was sure my daddy probably had had a  drink or two because he did drink privately. Alcohol was never allowed  in our house. I don   t even think rubbing alcohol.  Was that because of your mom   s experiences when she was younger,  what she thought she saw?  Alcohol was, in those days, evil. I guess it still is (Laughs) because I   m  an alcoholic, also. But anyway, this man said,    There was a man selling  coffee tables, nice looking, but no one was stopping by. I saw your  daddy stop and say,    How   s it going?    This man said,    I   m not doing  very well.    Your daddy said,    Wait a minute. I   ll sell something for you.     He jumped up on that table and started dancing, and said when it was all  over, the man had sold everything that he came representing.    My daddy  was a salesman. A tremendous salesman, entertainer, you name it.  Mother was a scholar. She studied. She had her master   s degree in  business at East Central almost completed. Had her thesis. At our house,  there was an attic that was upstairs. She had put her thesis on the  staircase, and one day my three older sisters said quietly they were going  to clean all of that. They threw her thesis away, which she didn   t know  for a while. She almost had a master   s in business. Again, she was not  the musician. My daddy was, and entertainer. I grew up with a musical  family because everyone in the family played. I was the youngest of five  and considered to be the dumbest, and there are a number of reasons.  One of them, traditionally, European folklore, if you go back and read it,  10  Larson  Logsdon  Larson  Logsdon  Larson  the youngest is always the dumbest, but the youngest always grows up  and outsmarts the others. I   m not going to brag, but    (Laughs)  I was dumb and untalented, and I wanted music so bad. Up the road, up  a hill from us was a music teacher that my sisters went to. My sister still  alive in Ada, four years older than I, is a musical genius. I mean, totally.  In college, majoring in music, they learned that she couldn   t read music.  Everything she knew came from her head. If they hummed it, she   d fill it  out. She was an accompanist for the high school choir. She may have  been able to read enough to get by. I remember the story. I remember  her coming home, and she had the old 78 set of Gershwin   s in Paris.  What is the     Oh, An American in     American in Paris, yes. They had wanted her to play that. She didn   t  know it, and she couldn   t read the music. She bought the album, 78, and  listened to it two or three times and then sat down and played it. She   s  still that kind. Music was our life to a great extent. We had music in the  family almost every night. If we didn   t have it as a family, someone was  in practice in something.  Who played what?  When it wound up, our oldest sister, Betty, who was seven years older  than I, played the piano a little, but she wasn   t that involved in it. She  married, maybe twenty years old, something. Jean, six years older than I,  (she   s still alive in Ada) played the fiddle, or should say, violin. She  played it because she had the training. She also played the fiddle because  she had a tremendous ear for it and knew a lot of the tunes my old daddy  played. My brother Bobby played the piano. Bobby was a musical  genius. By the time she came back to Oklahoma after teaching in  Wyoming and California with her husband, (he was also a teacher) she  could play nine different instruments.  They had a Chickasaw music program. I won   t say choir or whatever.  She was the piano for that after getting back to Ada. She played piano  with them. Not that we   re Chickasaw, but we   re proud of our Indian  heritage. My mother was extremely proud of it. John, my brother two  years older than I, played the mandolin. Being the youngest, when I was  seven I wanted to learn to play the piano, and they wouldn   t let me take  lessons. I could tell stories about that, but I won   t. In turn, the dumbest  in any musical group always played the bass. Did you know that?  I could assume so. (Laughter)  11  Logsdon  That   s a tradition, which is not true, but at the same time it was a  musical tradition and belief, so I played the bass. Frankly, I was pretty  good. Didn   t have any lessons. Played by ear. I did know when my sister  played, I could follow her left hand and see what to do. When I was  thirteen, we were sort of The Logsdon Family, only four. Our oldest  sister really wasn   t in it but three others in Ada. I know one of them had  learned to play or at least became excellent, one of the men in the  group   we became the Western Seven. I   m thirteen years old. He  learned or perfected while in prison. People forget that many Oklahoma  musicians in the early days, the country-western, (I won   t say bluegrass  because that wasn   t even in) they perfected a little in prison. I won   t go  into much more than that.  We had a guitarist, another fiddle player with my sister, I played the  stand-up bass, (we didn   t even know what an electric bass was in those  days) piano, and another guitar. I don   t think we had a steel. We were  the Western Seven. Thirteen years old, I stood up and watched. I could  see more stuff going on. (Laughs) Again, this is a favorite dance hall  story. We played every Saturday night for dance out at the American  Legion Hut on North Broadway in Ada. No booths or anything, just  tables. In those days, bootleg, not moonshine necessarily, some  moonshine but mostly bootleg, was kept in the trunk of a car. Take a  break, and everyone would go rushing to get to the booze in the trunk of  the car. That   s when fights broke out.  Hank Thompson told me   Oklahoma was still prohibition. The rest of  the nation wasn   t, but we were. They said when they booked a dance in  Oklahoma, they figured they were booking a fight, not a dance. Jim  Halsey, Jim told me that independently a few years later. Jim and  Manisa are good friends of ours. To book a dance in the late   40s,   50s,  you were booking a fight. One night, I   m up standing up bass, thirteen. I  might have just turned fourteen. This man falls. He   s on the floor. A  woman stands up, takes her shoe off, and hit him about five or six times  on the head. I   m watching. She put her shoe on, went to the women   s  room, and he got up, shook a little, got up, sat down. She came back,  looked at him, took her shoe off, hit him in the head three more times,  put her shoe on, and they got up and danced. (Laughs)  I am not smart enough to make that up. That   s just Oklahoma dance hall  times. I can tell other stories other friends have told me. About a year  later, we broke up. My sisters were going to college, doing different  things. I had wanted to learn music. They wouldn   t. My brother had a  guitar. He played mandolin, and he was sort of the one who inherited.  I   ll put it that way. He was six four. I was short. Anyway, he had a  guitar. Everyone was in school or gone, and I was a sophomore in high  school, I guess. I may have been a freshman. I don   t remember. I would  12  Larson  go home, and instead of doing my homework, because I didn   t give a  hang about my grades (I didn   t care what I made, which was kind of  sick, then) I taught myself to play the guitar.  The first song I learned was one that Hank Thompson had that was very  popular in those days. (Singing)    I am a roving gambler. I   ve gambled  all around. Whene   er I meet with a deck of cards, I lay my money  down.    That   s the song I learned. I don   t know all of it now. I was not  allowed to sing, either, growing up. In Sunday School, my brother and  his friends would make fun of me if I sang any. They were older and all,  but I didn   t do a whole lot publicly. I listened to, another bad habit in  those days   every day at noon, Johnnie Lee Wills, not Bob Wills,  Johnnie Lee Wills had his radio show over KVOO. I would rush home  during the lunch hour. This is when you had an hour and fifteen minutes.  You didn   t have cafeterias and all, although you could take your sack  lunch. I   d go home. We lived about a mile. I   d make the quick way.  Going by automobile, it was further, but I   d listen to that show. I learned     Milk Cow Blues.     As a junior in high school, four seniors and I organized and called  ourselves the Diamond D Boys. A fiddle, guitar, piano, drums, and bass  fiddle. The piano person was a Seminole Indian. I could tell stories  about him for a long time. Very talented, tremendous athlete, you name  it. Tony Wise was his name. We were practicing one day, going to do a  program for the high school group we used to have. I forget what we  called it, program day where different ones give programs. We were  going to do the program. I said,    Do you all mind if I   can I sing a  song?       Well, yes        Well, let   s practice.    So in the key of G, I had  learned it, listening to Johnnie Lee Wills. (Singing)    Well, I woke up  this morning, looked out the door. Could see my milk cow going. I could  tell by the way she lowed,    and on and on.  I got applause. Junior in high school, getting applause when I had never  received much of anything except criticism. I haven   t been worth a  damn since then. (Laughter) If you   re that age and you get applause, it  turns your life around. From then on, I continued to learn on my own  and married when I was a sophomore in college. Phyllis was a freshman.  She turned eighteen in November 17, 1953. I was nineteen. I didn   t turn  twenty until May of the following year. I was about a year and a half  older, and we got married. My parents were glad to see me get married  and get away. (Laughter) Anyway, from that point, I sang in a choir, and  high school singing became a part of my life. I loved it, and I still love it.  I don   t do much anymore, but I love it.  You mentioned your dad being a musician. What kind of songs did you  learn from him?  13  Logsdon  Larson  Logsdon  Well, growing up, he didn   t sing the songs. He was an instrumentalist,  fiddle. I can say that in 1982 was Oklahoma   s seventy-fifth anniversary.  Every year in Washington, the Smithsonian has their annual American  Folklife Festival, and they usually have a state and a country, bring them  in and have a week up there to show different folk traditional activities.  Well, I had become acquainted. I had gone to school in the two summers  at Indiana University, which was the folklore school of the nation at that  time and, in a way, of the world. I had twenty-two hours of graduate  folklore and knew some of the people.  I made contact and said,    Could Oklahoma       We worked it where  Oklahoma   Jack Kahn was alive in Oklahoma City. He was a major  banker, but he also had grown up in Ada, and he knew who my folks  were and all. Contacted him, and yes, they would underwrite it. I put the  music part together. I had an American Indian gospel, and I mean old  time, not current.  Shape note? Shape note singers?  They were a mixture. Looking back, Seminole and   well, I   ll say  basically yes because they came from down around Wewoka and in that  area, so Seminole would have been it. Anyway, I had them and Johnnie  Lee Wills and all his boys, and they said,    No, we don   t want anyone  who plays amplified instruments. We   re just playing.    I said,    Well, I   m  sorry, then. Oklahoma will not come.       Well, okay, we   ll let them,    and  they put in a dance floor. I   m proud to say, since 1982, electric  instruments and a dance floor has been there every year since because  they still do it. Went through different ones, all sorts of things musically.  Without saying who it was, I sent a recording of the Logsdon family,  and that included our second daughter who became a fiddle player,  Cindy, who is married to Baxter Black. She   s a tremendous fiddle  player, great musician. We were there. They invited that family, not  knowing it was mine. You asked about the songs. Well, there was a  song, one of the first ones I remember playing, called    Hargrave   s  March,    a tune my daddy had.    Hargrave   s March.    Ralph Rinzler was  head of the folklore division at the Smithsonian at that time. He had  come here, and took him different places. He interviewed different folks,  double checking, making sure some of the things was correct. In fact, he  and I went out and interviewed a moonshiner outside of Vinita. Didn   t  invite him but spent a couple hours and a few dollars with him.  The Logsdon family is playing. We were playing    Hargrave   s March,    a  fiddle tune. My sister and my brother and one on the piano. I was  playing guitar by then. He said,    That   s    Faded Love    you   re playing.     14  Larson     No it isn   t. It   s    Hargrave   s March   .    He said,    Listen to it. You   re  playing    Faded Love.       We got to listening, and sure enough. We   d  never paid that much attention to it. It basically was the melody of     Faded Love.    Well,    Faded Love    was introduced basically by Bob  Wills and them, but it was an old tune that came from northeast Texas as  a part of his heritage. No lyrics. Now he gets credit for the lyrics, but  Billy Jack, the youngest brother   there were four brothers and a bunch  of sisters in the Wills family.  Billy Jack wrote the lyrics to    Faded Love,    about 1951,    52. The  melody had become very popular. Billy Jack   s wife was divorcing him,  all sorts of problems. He was an alcoholic, also. He wrote those lyrics.  Then they put them in, and it became a hit everywhere. In turn, Billy  Jack told me, he said,    Bob, I   ll give you two thousand dollars, and we   ll  put dad   s name on it and my name. If anything goes wrong with us, dad  will       If you check, there   s no John Wills on it. It   s just Bob Wills.  Billy Jack sold it to them for two thousand dollars, but there were no  lyrics. That   s the kind of tune my daddy was playing.  We played it here in Tulsa many, many years ago. Curly Lewis, the  great fiddle player, was there. I told the story about    Faded Love,    and  afterwards Curly said,    I grew up learning that song as    Jealous Lover.        Same melody. So there are a lot of tunes in the music world that did not  come from the one given credit. Old traditional songs. That   s my  background. That   s how I became interested in Woody Guthrie. Phyllis  is from Okemah. When I was in college, before we married and even  afterwards, I ran across a John A. Lomax book and read it and saw that,  basically, the music I had grown up learning and hearing was called folk  music.  When we were married, not long, someone said,    Oh, you like folk?    I  said,    Yes.       Have you ever heard of our native son, Woody Guthrie?     Not many would talk about Woody. I said,    No,    but I tried to learn  more because I remembered the schoolteacher in Ada who had the  greatest influence on me. You cannot believe. He was Chickasaw Indian,  never married, and had five master   s degrees, qualified to teach  anything, and that includes home-ec for girls. His name was Arthur  Harrison, known as Art Harrison. I recalled he occasionally mentioned a  student he had had who was a writer named Guthrie. Many, many years  later, I had a 1929 Okemah High School annual given to me called The  Panther. That   s after I   d been working on Woody and all. I opened it up,  and there was Art Harrison. My teacher was Woody Guthrie   s teacher. I  say that   s one reason Woody was brilliant. He had a great teacher. Art  Harrison, that   s another story entirely.  I   ll ask you about it later. (Laughter)  15  Logsdon  That   s how I became interested in Woody. Again, there   s too much to go  into other than wound up reading Bound for Glory in California back in  1956. I read Bound for Glory not in Okemah or Oklahoma. You couldn   t  find a copy. Woody was basically blacklisted. His book was considered  to be ugly and communist, you name it. Out of desperation because I  couldn   t find a job in Ada or Oklahoma at that time, our sister, the piano  playing sister, and her husband were teaching out in California, so I  went out and got a job teaching in Norwalk, California, suburb of LA. I  went to the public library while I was out there, found a copy of Bound  for Glory, checked it out, read it, and became a Woody Guthrie devotee.  I still think he   s one of the greatest writers, not just this nation but the  world has ever had.  Continued, gave a program. Principal of the school said,    Would you  give a program?    I think it was a rotary club, Kiwanis Club, maybe, a  noonday show. I go down; I do three or four songs. I had found in the  school collection a Woody Guthrie CD, well yes, CD, ten inch. Checked  it out, played it, and I learned    This Land is Your Land.    I   d been  receiving applause. I said,    Here   s a song that an Oklahoman wrote  named Woody Guthrie.    I sang    This Land is Your Land    when it  wasn   t even popular. I didn   t get one applaud because Woody was a  communist. No one mentioned even knowing him. Hell, it didn   t bother  me. I knew I wasn   t well-liked either. (Laughs)  That encouraged me to do more. We continued, and through the years I  wound up meeting his second wife, Marjorie, who was the mother of  Arlo and the lady who took care of him. Even though they were  divorced, she took care of him during their Huntington   s disease. She  would come to Oklahoma, and I would pick her up at the airport in  Tulsa, take her out around the state where she would meet with families  that had Huntington   s. That was a disease that no one wanted you to  know because they were considered to be insane, crazy. It was known as  the    closet disease    because if a family member had it and company  came, they   d hide them. It had other names, but    closet disease     basically was it.  I took her around many places in the state. In turn, met Arlo, different  ones, Harold Leventhal, the administrator of the estate. Anyway, they  come around and say,    We   re going to do the movie Bound for Glory.     They sent a man. I think it was 1972. They sent a potential script writer.  I took him around the state and all. He went back and said,    Oklahoma  is not a place to film dust storms. We   ll have to do it in California.    I  loved that. I took him around to different places, and all they saw was  green grass and crops and hills and all this. They filmed it, the Dust  Bowl part, outside of Sacramento. That   s where the filming took place.  16  Larson  Logsdon  It was there that   well, prior to the filming, I   ll go back and say, I got a  phone call. They had been checking different ones to play the role of  Woody Guthrie. By then, we knew Mary Jo, Woody   s sister who was  living in Seminole at that time. She   s now ninety years old, living in  Shawnee in an assisted living home. Tremendous lady, great sense of  humor, very optimistic. Tremendous person. Became acquainted with  her. We gave a program together in Okemah is how we got acquainted. I  think five people showed up for it. You didn   t get much of a crowd  when you did Woody Guthrie. Phyllis and I were singing Woody  Guthrie things in Okemah when it was not popular, because I didn   t give  a damn. Anyway, they chose, I want to say Dale Carnegie, but that   s not  it. (Laughter) I   ve learned that it   s David Carradine. What did you say  his name was?  David Carradine.  David Carradine, okay. (Laughter) His father was John Carradine, the  actor. I think there were three brothers, all with different mothers.  Anyway, David was chosen. I can say that it was a strange choice  because Woody Guthrie was about five feet, seven or eight inches tall.  David Carradine was over six feet tall, but he could play the guitar a  little, so they chose him. Ann called and said,    Could we send David  Carradine back to Tulsa, and you show him around Oklahoma? He  needs to learn how Oklahomans talk.    (Laughs)    Sure.    So he came  back, but I wasn   t home at the time when Phyllis got a phone call from  the Columbia Movie Studios. I believe it was Columbia; I   m pretty sure  it was. They said,    David Carradine is coming, and if you have any  questions, call this number.    It was a number different from my number.  In a little while, we got another phone call.    Here is another number.    A  few hours later, she got a phone call,    Now, if you really have trouble,  call this.    She had three phone calls, so we knew that trouble might be  ahead. He brought his thirteen-year-old daughter with him. Our youngest  daughter at that time took care of him. Didn   t take care of him, but   she  was our number three, not our youngest. She was a teenager. She was a  few years older, but not that much older. She took care of the daughter  and stayed with her and learned many things that were shockers that  thirteen-year-old children are not supposed to know or do or have done.  I started driving David around. One night, (I forget where we were) he  said,    I don   t use dope anymore. I don   t use drugs.    He told me a few  stories that I cannot repeat. One was a wife, an early wife. Anyway, he  said,    I don   t use dope or drugs anymore. I just smoke marijuana.    I  thought,    Uh-oh.    Sure enough, my secretary at that time had not been  with me very long, and I guarantee you, when this was all over I started  17  to fire her. She knew, so she quit before I could fire her. (Laughs) She  knew where we were going. She   d call people and tell them. Everywhere  we went, to go eat or anything, there   d be someone in a parking lot  giving David marijuana. I think that   s what they were giving him. Every  time I saw a police car or a highway patrol car, I broke out in a cold  sweat. I thought,    If I get pulled over for anything, I   m in trouble,     because I   m not interested, wasn   t, and am still not interested in  marijuana or any of that stuff.  We go along and hear many different stories, and went to eat in this  Mexican restaurant that isn   t in town anymore.    Are there any women?     I said,    I   m sorry. I can get cigarettes for you, I can do a lot of things,  but I cannot find you a woman.    So he gives me an hour talk about his  experiences, and (again, I can   t repeat) what I should do if I ever wanted  to   how to approach   . I said,    No, David, that   s       Anyway, that was  just one.  Took him up to Kansas. Winfield, I think, is where the bluegrass and the  guitar factory   . He had invested. The guitar maker up there had gone  broke, was in trouble. David had put money in it and saved it. He wanted  to go up and get his guitar they had made for him, so I drove him up and  sure enough. I thought,    Man, I hope I don   t get pulled over.    Anyway,  everyone is happy to see him and glad. We   re going through all that. I   m  just killing time. I saw him take a handful of marijuana and crumble it  into that guitar, and I thought,    Uh-oh.    I thought,    Well, not anything I  can do about it.    We head back, and he said,    I   ve got to get my guitar.     We get his guitar and head back to Tulsa, and everything   s fine. No  questions asked,  didn   t get  pulled over, but there was a person here in  Tulsa. I won   t say what occupation or anything, but we did go over to  his house. This was in a pretty nice area of Tulsa. He had a big  marijuana patch behind the fence. David had found a friend. (Laughs)  It goes on and on. Finally, time for him and his daughter to go. Phyllis     family always had a family gathering up at  Lake  Tenkiller, the lodge at  Tenkiller each summer, each August. It was falling that weekend, so  I   take David and his daughter up. By then, his daughter loved the family  and Oklahoma. In fact, she cried. She did not want to leave Tenkiller.  She was in tears, wanted to stay when we came back. We didn   t spend  the night there. We took him up Saturday afternoon and came back  Saturday night. In turn, sitting there in the lodge there at Tenkiller,  eating supper, (or dinner, I guess we   d say) the little young boy came in  and   what was his, Oriental,  Kwai Chang Caine  Kung-Fu. The little  boy says,    There   s Kung-Fu     David,    Ah, goddamn, son-of-a        cussing. (Laughs) So we heard some stories that I won   t repeat.  Everything worked out. Everything was fine. Took him back. Was late  18  in Tulsa, and there was a man and a girl who had set up an apartment.  They had an apartment, and he was to go up and spend some time with  them. I took him by. He goes up, and I went back later. He took his  guitar with him and went back and he said,    I don   t know what  happened, but I wanted some marijuana, and I knew there was some in  my guitar, but it was empty.    I didn   t tell him that when I left Winfield  just walking around, I saw the guitar going down the belt to be cleaned. I  saw the man doing the cleaning put the vacuum in and clean the inside  of the guitar out. (Laughs) I knew there was no marijuana in the guitar. I  didn   t tell him.  Got him to the airport that morning. That was Saturday night or Sunday  morning. Got him to the airport, and his daughter. They told me,    Don   t  let him out of your sight until he is on the plane.    So we   re out there,  and people saw him, and some knew who he was. He said,    Well, thank  you, Guy,    and reached over and kissed me. (Laughs) I said,    Oh, Lord  have mercy,    being seen in public, being kissed by David Carradine. I  survived, but it was rather embarrassing. I can say, they flew us out to  watch some of the filming out in Sacramento. I learned that by the time  he got to California after leaving Tulsa, he had been picked up or he had  picked up a girl or she picked him up. Anyway, they were still together  out in California.  Out there, I learned a lot of things. I think I told you the story about the  cinematographer and his experience getting started here in Tulsa, which  I will not repeat on camera. (Laughs) We were out there and met Woody  Guthrie   s second or first wife. We had met her at different gatherings  we   d attended through the years. She had their second daughter with her.  They had two daughters and a son out in Texas. The first daughter had  already died of Huntington   s. This daughter was dying. I   ve got a photo  of her with Harold Leventhal, and she was going through the early  symptoms of Huntington   s, which was very sad. We knew what it was  and didn   t say anything. She later died from Huntington   s the same way.  The son had been killed in a car-train wreck. His first children were  gone, Woody   s first. I won   t get started in the others because Cathy, the  first daughter who was Arlo   s older sister, had died from burns. It   s a  long story.  Marjorie and Woody had been living together, and Marjory was  pregnant. She was married to another man. Woody was still married to  his first wife, and yet they were living together in New York City. They  both eventually got divorces and were married so that Cathy would have  a legitimate name. Woody was singing for a Union meeting over in New  Jersey, I think it was, one night. Marjorie was there with Cathy, and this  was in the Brooklyn or the Coney Island area. Second floor apartment, I  think it was. She had to go across the street to the grocery store to get  19  some things. Cathy was four years old. Said,    Now, stay.    Told some  neighbors she was leaving, had the door unlocked and open. Crossed the  street and hadn   t been out of the house a minute when a spark from a  wartime radio caught Cathy   s dress on fire.  A young man upstairs heard her yelling, and he ran down to help, but it  was basically too late. The door had been closed and the smoke was in  the room, so she died from burns and smoke, inhaling it. They got her to  the hospital when Marjorie came back across the street when she saw  and went in. Got Cathy to the emergency room very quickly and left a  note on the door telling Woody when he came in from his singing  engagement to go to the hospital. Cathy died the next day. She did die.  Woody wrote a letter to Mary Jo, his sister, and one to his father.  They   re in this book that Mary Jo and I put together. Very moving. The  end of it is,    Tell all our family and friends,    Don   t cry. There is no  reason to cry over something that can   t be done. Cathy was happy the  day she died.        Cathy was the New York daughter. His older sister started with   I have  to think about it. She died from burns. In turn, they thought that  Woody   s mother, Nora, had become angry. They all, in those days in  Okemah, thought they were insane, crazy. The word    insanity    wasn   t  even part of it. Crazy. They thought that in a fit of craziness, she had  thrown burning coal oil on the daughter. I   ve got to think. I know it, but  anyway, I   ll get it in a minute. I want to say Caroline, but that   s not it. It  might have been Caroline. I   ve got to look because I   m getting too much  stirred up there in the brain right now.  Anyway, later his father was burned seriously. They thought then that  Nora had thrown burning coal oil on him. Woody in Bound for Glory  explained all of it differently. I prefer Woody   s explanations, not the  local interpretation. Bound for Glory had references to both. I think his  story about his sister dying   he was about six years old. She said,     Woodly, come in.    She called him Woodly. He goes into this very  moving story. Said the teacher came in, and this conversation   have you  read it? It   s a great, I think, brilliant emotional depiction out of Woody   s  imagination. Most of it is true, but Bound for Glory was a novel, an  autobiographical novel. It was not an autobiography. Still, many  consider it to be an autobiography.  Many years ago, I was at the Library of Congress. I was going through  some of Alan Lomax   s material that mentioned Woody, and I found this  letter that Woody had written after Bound for Glory was published. He  said,    Alan, have you read my novel?    Woody called it his novel. He  never referred to it as an autobiography, but some of it is so true that you  know it   s autobiography in many ways, but then there is an exaggeration  20  Larson  Logsdon  to ease some things. The scene between his sister and the teacher said  his sister was lying there and said to the teacher,    Do you think I   ll  pass?    She said,    Yes, you   ll pass,    and took her fingers and closed the  eyes. I want to say Caroline, but that   anyway.  You mentioned with Bound for Glory that one of the reasons David  Carradine had come out was to see some of the places, I think to meet  some of the people and to learn a little bit about the vernacular or the  dialect, I guess?  They wanted for him to learn how people talked. There are many  Oklahomans who don   t understand that we do have our own dialect. We  used to. We don   t now. I took him to meet Mary Jo. He spent time with  Mary Jo. We were there. I took him to the London House. In fact, they  are trying to raise money to rebuild the London House. The Guthrie  family only lived in the London House a short time. I   ve seen the house  where Woody was born. The house in which Woody was born burned  not long after his birth. As Woody said later, fire haunted him.  His last times of sanity or of being totally   as the early stages of  Huntington   s came in, he had his third wife, or third girlfriend at the  time, but they later married. It was in Mexico. They had a Mexican  marriage. I read a letter that she wrote to Woody   s father saying,    We  never did get married,    but I don   t know if that was after. Woody was  fixing breakfast one morning in Florida. These are early Huntington   s  days. His girlfriend was pregnant, and they were living in an abandoned  bus. He went out to fix breakfast and threw his gasoline on to start the  fire because he was making   they didn   t have any gas or anything. They  had to cook their own, outside. There were coals burning underneath. It  inflated, came up, and burned his arm severely. Basically, he could  never play the guitar again. Anyway, it burned him. He was burned, his  father, his sister died from burns, the house in which he was born  burned, and then his daughter died from burns, so Woody felt like fire  haunted him.  David Carradine met Mary Jo and different ones around. There is a  photo. I know I have a copy of it. I think it   s been printed. Some people  knew David was in town down in Okemah. He   s standing in the  window. The London House was lower, and the floor   it was on an  embankment. The upper floor, I guess you   d call it, was even with the  back part of the house, and the lower was out front. I   ve got a drawing of  it down there, and I have photos somewhere I   ve taken of it. Anyway,  it   s this photo of David standing in the back of the London House with  young people gathered around, and his photo was taken. They knew in  Okemah that David Carradine was there.  21  Larson  Logsdon  Interesting thing, in Okemah, I believe 1976 was the year,    77,    76, that  Bound for Glory was filmed. Again, the first script writer, Millard  Lampell was his name. He had been in the almanacs and all. He and  Woody did not get along, necessarily, but he was still going to write the  script. They flew him in before they even knew David was going to be  there. I took Millard Lampell, took him around. Took him to the London  House and different places. In the lower level of the London House, he  wrote,    Finally made it, Woody.    Something like that. I have a slide I  took of that, but I can   t lay my hands on it immediately. I went back and  took it. I wished when I found out they had torn the house down   I  knew it was falling apart, but I thought they were going to keep it up. I  say    they   . The owner, Earl Walker, owned the house. In turn, he let it  go. I was going to cut that piece of  writing  but didn   t, so it   s been  destroyed along with many, many other statements to Woody.  Carradine and Okemah got along fine. There was no problem. They  didn   t even know Millard Lampell was there. I   m trying to think of the  year. Marjorie, Harold Leventhal, Arlo, his wife, and their son, about six  months, eight months old, first child, they all came to Okemah trying to  make Okemah like Woody better and to work out a purchase of the  London House. Earl was not interested. In turn, the banker down there,  not the old bank but the new banker who came in from Bristow whose  parents owned banks in Bristow, sent him down, I think, to get rid of it.  He came out against Woody, and you talk about people running away.  We were able to meet and eat. This is Harold, Marjorie, Arlo, his wife,  child, Phyllis, and I, and a couple of our daughters were with us. We all  met in the lobby of the abandoned (I won   t say totally abandoned) hotel.  We ate, and afterwards she got kicked out for letting us eat there. So  there are a lot of things.  How did you originally get tied into the production of Bound for Glory?  Well, I was the only one in Oklahoma who would talk about Woody,  just about. There were two or three others, I guess. I had been on library  trips. I would go by the Woody Guthrie office up on Fifty-Seventh  Street, just off Broadway. Harold Leventhal and Marjorie Guthrie had a  office together at that time. They later moved down to the twelfth floor,  and now they   re over at Mount Kisco  NY . Harold   s dead, and  Marjorie, but the archives are over at Mount Kisco. The archives were  there. I became acquainted with the people in New York City. I was up.  They had a meeting (I forget how it was) to do a little Woody gathering  item. It was a gathering of people who liked and respected Woody,  basically in the New York area, but they had invited me up.  I knew a bunch of them. That pretty much was it. I was the only  Oklahoman who would stick his neck out. I say that not in self-  22  Larson  Logsdon  Larson  Logsdon  Larson  glorification because I didn   t look at it in that way. I did it because I had  great respect for Woody Guthrie, and I thought the state should respect  him also. I had numerous phone calls, some accusing me. You   d be  amazed at the hatred that some of the anti-communist   . I look back and  think they were fascist. I think they all liked Adolf Hitler. That   s not  true, but it   s easy to think it when you look at the damage and  destruction that the anti-communists did, mostly for political purposes,  not for social or economic reasons, but for political.  I better be quiet about some of this, hadn   t I? (Laughs) They   ll go after  me again  Woody was a tremendous writer. I felt there was nothing  wrong with becoming acquainted with the people. I forget the name of  the poet in New York City, was homosexual, a very famous poet. I   d  have to think twice about his name. Anyway, he was at that meeting, the  Woody meeting I was at. It turns out that he, Arlo, his wife, and I were  in a taxicab together. I think Jane was there. It may have just been Arlo,  this man, and I in the cab. A lot of stuff back and forth. Apparently there  was something written about me being at this meeting alone with all  these others, naming them.  TU had a professor who did not like communists, period, but the student  body hired this poet to come in and give a program. He wanted a guitar  backing, so they called and asked if I would. I met with him, and we  worked it out. On the stage, he and Guy Logsdon would do this. This  faculty member and his wife were good friends, longtime friends. I  looked out, and there they were on the front row. (Laughs) He said,     Well, we knew you were in it, so we thought maybe it wouldn   t be too  bad.    Lord have mercy, I have gone through all sorts of things with  Woody, and I   m happy that I have. It   s been quite a learning experience.  What did you think of the movie when it came out?  The movie, it   s all right. It was a good movie. Accuracy and all, I didn   t  like Carradine because I knew Woody was small and a different  personality entirely from Carradine, but Carradine did a good job of  playing Woody. I told everyone,    Yes, it   s all right.    I do. I still have  copies. In fact, I have a copy of the script. I can   t knock the movie.  Haskell Wexler, the cinematographer, got an Oscar for it. I think there  was another Oscar given to someone. I forget which.  For the music.  The music, okay, that   s right.  Which is appropriate.  23  Logsdon  Larson  Logsdon  (Laughter) Yes. Anyway, some of the scenes just weren   t Oklahoma  scenes. (Laughs) I   ll put it that way. You cannot do anything perfectly,  period. It   s a good movie, I like it, but at the same time, I know too  much about too much and too many, and I have to sit and think and  remember some of those things. It does have an effect on you. I think  Phyllis is the same way because she went through a lot of this with me.  It   s an excellent movie. Carradine did a good job. I can   t knock it that  way. Arlo does not like the movie, I can guarantee you. I   ve visited with  him, and he does not like the movie because he sees his father through  different eyes. I guess in a way, I do, too. I had my own vision, my own  concepts, and not those of a filmmaker, but it   s a very good movie. I  think people should see it. For one thing, it explains a lot of things going  on during Woody   s time that haunted him.  Do you want to stop here for today?  Well, whatever. If you   ve got any questions     -------  -------
