 Little Thunder  Akers  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Saturday, September 9,  and I   m interviewing Norman Akers as part of the Oklahoma Native  Artists Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Norman   s home, just  outside of Lawrence. You   re a well-known painter and print maker, a  recipient of the prestigious Jean Mitchell Painters and Sculptors Grant,  and a professor of painting at the University of Kansas. Thank you for  taking the time to talk with me.  You   re welcome, Julie.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Well, I was actually born in Fairfax, Oklahoma, so I was raised in Osage  County. I spent pretty much all my youth there. I did go to high school at  Skiatook for a while, which is not too far from Tulsa. However, it  seemed like my life was so connected to Fairfax that every weekend, I  went back to Fairfax. It was sort of an odd growing up, in a way,  (Laughter) but Fairfax is my home, and it   s an important place for me. I  may be jumping a little bit ahead, but I know I have always had this  strong connection to home and still try to maintain close ties with family  and community there.  How about your folks?  Well, I   m mixed-blood. My father is Osage. My mother is Anglo. My  father was typical of most Osages from that time period. He grew up in  Oklahoma. He went to boarding school and that whole experience. My  mother, she had lived both in Oklahoma, around Tulsa, Fairfax, Pawnee,  that kind of area. That   s where her folks were from. They got married  after she finished up her high school in Fairfax. That was pretty much it.  She   s still living in Oklahoma. She worked for the Osage County at the  5  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  courthouse for a number of years and also the assessor   s office.  How about your grandparents? Were they around at all, either side?  I spent quite a bit of time with my grandparents on my mother   s side. In  one way, I felt like probably a good part of my youth was spent around  them because she was busy working and everything. My grandmother on  my father   s side, she died quite young, and so I never knew her, but I  knew my great-grandmother on my father   s side. The early part of my  life, there was a very strong connection with her.  What was her name?  Her name was Eva, Eva Little Star. She went by Star, shortened the  name. She was very instrumental in my life for the time that I knew her  because I felt like, somewhere, that connection gave me a stronger  connection to home, in a sense. I felt like I really did spend a lot of my  growing up with my grandparents, which I think changed how I looked  at people.  In what way?  I don   t know. I guess I was used to being around older people, for one.  Also, there was something about a work ethic. My grandfather was not  the type of person to sit around, and so I literally did grow up every  weekend   every weekend there was some sort of project that we  worked on, whether I was spending time just fiddling with his tools or  being what I would call a tool monkey. That was just part of growing up.  (Laughter)  I really haven   t talked much about him, so this is kind of the first time in  an interview I   m reminiscing, I guess, about my relationship with him  because he was a real quiet man. Didn   t have a whole lot to say. If  something bothered him, he   d let you know. The best way I can describe  it, he was very inquisitive. He was always fascinated with things, how  things worked, and I think somehow, growing up and being around him,  that sort of made me think that way.  I told someone a funny story a while back. It was like when microwave  ovens came out. I can remember him taking me to the furniture store so I  could watch them cook a hotdog in a microwave oven. (Laughter) I  think that was his excuse for getting out of the house. (Laughter) I still  remember that crazy experience of going to the furniture store in Fairfax  and watching them cook hotdogs and hamburgers in a microwave oven.  (Laughter) Yes, it   s funny. I start to think back on it and I realize,     Wow, that   s        6  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  A sense of curiosity     It   s a curiosity, but we think of microwaves as being commonplace  today. (Laughter)  Are you Osage and Pawnee?  I   m actually Osage. That   s always been sort of complicated, I think, as  many people know in Native country. My grandfather was Osage. He  wasn   t Pawnee, but my last name, Akers, is connected to a Pawnee man.  I knew him when I was young. I have memories of him, as well. I   ve got  family over in Hominy, as well. In fact, I   m related to Anita Fields.  Uncle Richard, her dad, was my father   s uncle, so it   s kind of a  connection among Osage artists.  That kind of sorts a little bit of that out because I   ve read into that quite  a bit in the past. Likewise, I know that my father, when he was young,  after he lost his mother, there were a lot of things going on that he was  raised over in Pawnee for a while. It was just that time, and it was how  people were then.  What is your first memory of seeing art?  There was a lady named Helen Bear who lived in Fairfax, and her  grandsons and I were really close friends. Her daughter, Alice Couch,  was a close friend of my mother   s, so we had that connection. What I  remember about Helen Bear   s house was it was sort of salon style. She  had photographs, old photographs, those old, round, oval photographs of  her parents and great-grandparents or whatever, relatives    pictures. But  she had a collection of paintings from people like Fred Beaver and   Acee  Blue Eagle and that whole Bacone school. Apparently, when she  was younger, she must   ve either known or she had collected these  artists.  Whenever I would go over to play, I always felt like I would spend a  moment looking at all the paintings and things in her house. That was  probably the first time that I could really think about, like, seeing  paintings because I didn   t grow up going to museums. Museums were  something that we just didn   t do for the most part.  However, somehow I had a very strong interest in drawing and sculpting  clay. My parents and grandparents were very supportive of that because  I   m pretty sure when I was involved in things like that I wasn   t  bothering them. (Laughter) I kind of joke about it because usually when  I engage in some sort of project, I   m very obsessive. I remembered as a  7  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  kid I was extremely obsessive about if I was going to sculpt something  or make something. I would spend hours on it, and the same thing with  drawing.  So are we talking Play-Doh or clay?  Play-Doh, clay, just old modeling clay and things like that. Some of my  very earliest memories were building little towns underneath this apricot  tree that we had next to the house. It would flood the place. (Laughter) I  would literally take the mud and start pushing it and carving and making  all sorts of little buildings and things. Growing up, I was very  imaginative and very involved, that notion of, as I said, just making.  It   s funny because some of my earliest memories, too, I can remember  the postage stamps. I would always tear the postage stamps off the  letters that came to the house. It used to be like all you would get were  images of George Washington, that same postage stamp. When the  commemorative stamps started coming out, I would find a letter that  would come, and it would have this little   I would tear it off, and I  would actually glue it to the floorboards of the house. I can remember  laying down on the floor and looking at these little postage stamps.  Just enjoying the visual effect.  Enjoying the images on there. Then, it dawned on me: I was creating my  own little museum. It was a little gallery, just tiny little pictures, in a  sense. This was long before, as I said, I went to museums but for some  reason was just really inquisitive, liked to make things. I don   t think I  was really a good student.  I was going to ask about art experiences once you got into   let   s start  with elementary school.  Yes, because when I was in elementary school and grade school, I  wasn   t a good student for the most part. I think there were a number of  issues I was dealing with. One was glasses. I found out, actually, I  couldn   t see, which set me back a year. Somehow, making art was one  thing that I excelled at, and most of my instructors recognized that.  They did?  Yes, for some reason I was just, again, real fortunate that people picked  up on it. I think in my whole experience in grade school and junior high  and high school, I can think of only maybe a couple times where I had  an instructor that really tried to push that down, who wasn   t receptive to  it, but just about everybody was engaged in. Also, I was extremely shy  8  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  and backwards. It may not appear that way now, but I was very quiet.  That took a long time for me to get over.  What   s one of your more outstanding memories of an interaction with a  teacher or a project that you finished that you were happy about?  I did a number of projects. There was a doctor in Skiatook, (his name  was Dr. Wolf) and he had just built a new clinic. I remember I did, like,  two or three murals for him.  In high school?  Yes, in high school.  Wow   This was during my senior year. He paid me appropriately for them. I  can   t even remember what it was. Actually, I never got the money. The  deal was is that he would put it toward my first year of college, so that  helped me go to the Kansas City Art Institute, which was a wise thing.  Let   s face it. An eighteen-year-old getting a lot of money? Mm-hmm.  (Laughs) I remember he had a big grand opening and everything. They  had a reception and like an awards ceremony, and it was the first time  that I   d ever kind of dealt with this.  For you?  For the whole, the clinic and everything and being the, I guess you could  call it, the guest artist. It was a marvelous experience. Also, at the same  time, the high school counselor had invited Brummett Echohawk to  come to speak to me, talk to me. I showed my portfolio to Brummett,  and we got to visiting. He knew my grandfather from my Pawnee  connection. It was real interesting. What struck me about my meeting  with Brummett was that he was   I respect the fact that he was generous  with his time, and he provided some wise advice.  What did he say?  He actually gave me a real critique. He didn   t say,    Oh, this is nice. This  is really good. Good, you   re on your way to being an artist.    (Laughter)  That   s not what I got. I got,    You need to think about this. You need to  do this. This is kind of working, but you still have a long ways to go.     (Laughter) I mean, that was good.  He asked me,    Where are you going?    I said,    Well, I   m looking at the  Institute of American Indian Arts  IAIA , or I   m looking at maybe one  9  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  of the state schools.    He said,    Well, if you can go to an art institute, you  need to do that because there   s no sense in doing a two-year degree. If  you can find you a good school and you can afford it, do that.    So that  kind of directed me to the Kansas City Art Institute because I   d thought  about Chicago. Growing up in Fairfax, that wasn   t going to work. I  mean, Kansas City was big enough, and it was close enough to home  because I was still having this attachment issue, too. It was like 250  miles was tolerable, but not 700. (Laughs)  Right. You didn   t really know anybody in Kansas City, but it was closer.  It was close. It was close and     Had a good reputation.     had a good reputation. My folks, they took his advice, and that was, as  I say, it made a difference in my life. Eventually, I did go back to IAIA,  which we can chat about.  Before entering the KC Art Institute, what was your style and subject  matter?  Probably just like about any other adolescent from that mid-   70s:  record album art. I wanted to do record covers, cartoons. I drew  airplanes instead of hot rods for some reason. (Laughter) Never had a  fascination with cars. I did a lot of copies, too, of other artists    work. I  copied a lot of Allan Houser. I copied a lot of     We   re talking painting?  Painting, yes, like Fred Beaver. Things that I could find photographs in  magazines and things. I copied those. I had an art instructor, and I don   t  know whatever happened to him. His name was Bob Wade. He was  actually kind of I think a basketball coach/art instructor. This was when I  was in Skiatook. He was giving me a lot of these things.  He gave me a book on  George  Catlin, and I remember I copied I don   t  know how many of those Catlin paintings. (Laughter) It was kind of  interesting because I always enjoyed doing it. I remember growing up  making these pictures of Straight Dancers and Roman soldiers because I  liked that crested, you know. So there was this weird multicultural thing  going on, even as a youth. (Laughter)  You already had that mix going.  I think like with all young people, you kind of rebel. It seemed like it  10  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  was sort of being pushed. My father was like,    This is what you need to  paint.    And then,    No.    Of course, what he considered art was that  Oklahoma style but also  Frederic  Remington and  Charles Marion   Russell. It was that whole Western, let   s face it, Cowboy Hall of Fame  kind of aesthetic in a sense. I have funny stories about that, too, because  he would sort of dangle the carrot. He   d say,    Yes, I   ll give you some  money to go to school on, but you got to make me a painting.     (Laughter) So I   ve done my fair share of buffalo hunts. (Laughter) In  retrospect, I look back, and they were fun.  You were still practicing.  Yes, I was practicing my skills, but that was the kind of work that I was  doing before I went to the Art Institute. I will tell you a funny story real  quick just because it   s on my mind, here, one of those incidences where  my father was saying,    Yes, I   ll give you some money to go to school  on, but you   ve got to paint a picture of a headdress on a rock.     He kind of got impatient with me because it took a while. Finally, I said,     I   ve got it.    He said,    Where   s it at?    I pulled out this tea towel, handed  it to him, and he just kind of looked bewildered. (Laughter) I finally  looked and said,    You know, it took me a long time to find the right kind  of rock to paint that headdress on.    He just looked and said,    We really  do think differently, don   t we?    (Laughter) He wanted, of course, as you  can imagine, a regular painting. I went out on the prairie and spent all  this time wandering around trying to find the right kind of rock to do this  painting on, which was kind of funny.  But kind of getting back on track here, my first year at the Art Institute  was, I really   I had no idea. I was completely lost. I went into a  foundations program and was introduced to all sorts of new ways of  making art, new ways of thinking. It really shook and kind of  destabilized my notion of what art was. I found that I think that  experience was extremely good. I can remember calling home and  saying,    I have no idea what I   m doing. I just hope I   m doing the right  thing.    (Laughter)  Are you about nineteen?  I was eighteen. What I remembered about it was it was extremely  rigorous, and having a work ethic was never an issue with me. That  came from growing up. I just knew that if I had to be there all day to do  it, then I did it. I remember my first art history class. I mean, I really did  look at people like Picasso and Monet, the Impressionists. I just thought  that was kind of strange painting. I didn   t understand why it was good or  anything. What I found was that I went to the library like once a week  11  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  and checked out books. I wasn   t really reading them. I was just looking  at images, and I kept looking at images. I just wanted to know,    What  makes this good?    Actually, that habit still kind of stays with me.  I   ve found over the years I   ve managed to purchase a lot of books, but  even though I   m here at KU now, I still go to the library fairly regularly,  go through and grab books so I can look at images. It   s a little dated  now, with the Internet and that accessibility to information, but for some  reason, I enjoy just being in the library and being able to physically hold  a book and thumb through it. There   s something, as I said, very tangible  about having a book in your hand, that that   s important.  Your take-away from the Kansas City Art Institute, would you describe it  as basically foundational? What did you take away from that?  I think when I left the Art Institute, I realized I had actually achieved my  objective. I had a good understanding of what art was. One thing I   ll say  is I dropped out for one year and worked in a factory and went over to  Europe and looked at paintings. I had some help from my father. When I  was over in Europe, I realized,    Oh, yes. This is what I want to do the  rest of my life, is make paintings.     What a great education that was   It was incredible. I don   t think my parents thought I was going to do it  because I went by myself and spent a little over two months roaming  around to museums and cities. As I said, it was a good experience. When  I left the Art Institute, I felt like I was making competent paintings. I had  a good basis in art history.  Were you embarked on this path of non-realism?  Yes, I was. I mean, my goal was to try to go from realism to abstraction  but to understand what abstraction was. Of course, good abstraction,  from my perspective, is still based in some sort of realism. It has its  roots to something real, whether it   s emotional or physical. What I found  was that was what was happening with my painting. More and more as it  was beginning to abstract, in a sense, I was still seeing a connection back  to something real. Of course, I think that echoes my life in many ways  because, I mean, as an artist I   ve moved away from Oklahoma and  moved away from that little community that I grew up, grown and  expanded an awful lot. And yes, my ideas can be a little different at  times, but the thing about them is that they still make this connection  back to place.  So, you are painting with oils and acrylics, basically?  12  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  I was primarily doing oil painting. I had just gotten introduced to  printmaking when I was at the Art Institute, did some intaglio classes  and did a little lithography class. It was mainly painting.  Then you decide to get a Certificate of Museum Studies, is that correct,  at the Institute  of American Indian Arts ?  Yes.  Is there a time lapse between your BFA and   .  Actually, no, not very much. I think it was within a year that I went out  to Santa Fe. Bear in mind, Wendy Ponca was at the Art Institute when I  was there. Wendy and I are related, so of course I knew Carl, her dad.  Carl went out to Santa Fe to teach at that time. He was in Norman.    I  need some help moving. Do you want to come along?    I said,    Sure.     Didn   t have anything else to do. (Laughter) Somehow, after I was out  there, he kind of coerced me into going to school. Actually, it was good  because the minute I landed in Santa Fe I was like,    Oh, this is a very  interesting place. I   d like to figure out how to stay.     So, you weren   t so much interested in museum studies, per se.  No. I went and did museum studies because I already had a studio  degree. I have to admit, I was sort of worried about,    Well, how do you  make a living as an artist?    This type of experience can translate into a  job. I have to say that as a student, I was only at IAIA for probably  maybe a year because, one, I just went in and did the certificate. There  was no messing around. It was done. They were on a block system at the  time, and I think I actually did it in the three blocks. I took printmaking  courses there at the time because I had just got enough of a taste of it at  Kansas City.  One of the things   I   m going to go back to my high school experience.  One of the things I remember this fellow, Bob Wade, did, he gave me a  book or a magazine that had a whole series of prints that were made at  IAIA. They were artists like Kevin Red Star and Earl Biss, T. C.  Cannon, (they   re kind of like the big guys in my eyes) and other people.  I remember I was fascinated with those images, so that was the other  thing that kind of drew me back to the printmaking. I have to say, I think  IAIA   I don   t know if people focus on it that much, but I think IAIA  has had a very strong and rich history in printmaking.  In that specific area.  13  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  In that specific area. There   s been so many artists that came out of the  school and have produced really incredible prints.  And you were mentioning that Seymour Tubis wasn   t there anymore.  No, he wasn   t there.  What was the instruction situation?  The instruction situation was, (and I probably am going to be a little  critical with this) it was pretty loose at the time. I   m not going to name  any names or anything, but I   ll just say I felt like we were fending for  ourselves, in a way. The time that I was working at IAIA in the  printmaking studio, there was Michael McCabe, Bobbi Emerson  Kitsman, Joe Maktima. There were a few others as well, but I think of  those three, primarily. We kind of had free reign of the studio. We had  the keys, and so we were printing until like one and two o   clock in the  morning, almost every night. I can remember it was like in a semester  we   d pump out six or seven editions.  And you were marketing them in town?  Oh, yes, (Laughter) of course. I mean, I immediately realized I can take  the work to the IAIA Museum. Chuck Dailey was the director there, and  they had a little space where they sold student work. Of course, the  minute we   d edition a print, you   d pull one out and get it shrunk-wrapped  or matted and take it to the museum and wait. (Laughter) Did  an awful lot of that. I think IAIA was an incredible place, is an  incredible place, because it expanded my world view, particularly of  Native America because, as I say, growing up in Oklahoma, it was very  limited in my understanding. When I was at IAIA, I was connected with  other people from the Southwest, Navajo people, Pueblo people, people  from up north, so that, I think, was just extremely exciting.  Another thing, too, that happened, (and this kind of came out of my  experience at the Art Institute in Kansas City) I realized everything that I  was focusing on was very Western. It was looking at the history of  Renaissance painting, contemporary American art, European art. My  objective to become like an abstract expressionist was very Eurocentric  in its direction, and IAIA kind of changed that. It was interesting  because probably the one person I connected with at IAIA was Barbara  Emerson Kitsman because she was a landscape painter. Both of us  painted landscapes. We would get together, travel, and paint around  Santa Fe, and things like that...  14  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Oh, that   s cool. Do plein air?     and do plein air painting. It was kind of funny because I think some of  the other students at IAIA looked at it like,    Why are you doing that?     (Laughter) I said,    Well, because I like to be outside, like to paint  landscapes.    In a strange way, I didn   t totally fit in IAIA. I think I was  dealing with other things besides dealing with the Market in Santa Fe. I  wasn   t trying to make images that were simply about going into the  Santa Fe Market, although I think the longer that I stayed there, the more  I started doing that because I was there in Santa Fe for probably about  four years the first time. The whole time I was in New Mexico from,  like,    82 to    88, I was kind of bouncing back and forth between  Oklahoma and Santa Fe.  When you started moving that direction, was it just out of necessity, or  was it that the influence was so pervasive     It was definitely the influence. I mean, let   s face it. Adobe houses  fascinated me. We were talking a little bit earlier about the first time you  had seen some of the work. I was doing these serigraphs because what I  loved about the houses was that they were brown, they were pink, and  they were earth colors, but they were skin colors. They had this very  organic feel, and they reminded me of people, and they had a  personality. I did. I started off with a series of serigraphs called Some  Houses Remind You of People. I was strongly influenced by the  Southwest and participated at Indian Market for about, I think, three,  maybe four years.  During the    80s?  During the    80s, I think, the last time I did it. It might   ve been three  years because 1988 was the last year that I did that. During that whole  time I was doing Market, I was really geared towards marketing work,  selling work, and so I was really making a product.  You had to support yourself, too. You were out of school.  That was basically it. Yes, I think the last year that I did it, the last  couple years I did it, I was starting to realize that was not where I  wanted to be.  Then you ended up having yet another layer. They   re wonderful layers  of these experiences. You went to the University of Illinois at  Champagne? What drew you over there?  Actually, there was three of us who were recruited to University of  15  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Illinois. It was Marcus Amerman, Charlene Teters, and myself.  That   s a great trio.  Yes, it was. Marcus didn   t stay very long. He was gone before the first  semester. He realized that that was not his path. Charlene and I were in  the painting program there. I think for both of us it was an eye-opening  experience. I don   t know if you   re familiar with Charlene   s work and  her activism and Chief Illiniwek and that. I know when she was there,  she was able to really route that whole issue, the frustration with what  was going on in the community and the school, and turn it into an art  form. She was very vocal and outward. For myself, I stayed in the studio  for the most part.  Charlene would tease me. She   d say,    Come out. Let   s go out.     (Laughter) I went out a few times with her. I   d just go and say,    This is  way too public for me.    I   ve never thought of myself as an activist. It  was so funny. About a year later I was making these paintings, and I was  still saying,    I   m not an activist.    I was looking at this big painting I was  doing, and the title of the painting was called Collision of Heavenly  Structures. I kind of went,    Oh. Yes, I am. I just don   t realize it.     (Laughter)  Certainly making a political statement.  Well, I think that   s the case. If you   ve grown up as a Native person,  politics has been a part of your life if you have to deal with the agency. I  still think about when people would come to the school, and they would  have these assemblies, and they   d want you to raise your hand if you  were Native. I was,    Well, why are they doing that?    Of course, it was  to get money for the school, or other things. You just realize that it   s an  inseparable part of your life, basically.  When you graduated from University of Illinois, what skills, in terms of  painting, do you think you   d added?  One of the things, I think my painting effectively changed. Again, it got  more personal. It was one of the first times I started feeling like I was  really actually dealing with much more cultural information, a notion  about identity and place. For some reason in Illinois, it kind of  manifested there. There was just something about really being away  from home or being disconnected from people that I knew, so all of a  sudden those issues became more important to me.  It kind of came out of this   I remember one of the professors basically  said,    Your culture is dead. Why are you even dealing with it?    He said  16  Little Thunder  Akers  that early on, and that was a challenge to make sure that he was wrong. I  think Charlene and I, both, we were dealing with that and making sure  that he was aware that,    No, it   s alive, and it   s vibrant, and we   re dealing  with issues. We   re people.    That   s what kind of happened. So I found  my work. I was exploring these notions of identity.  It was also probably the first time that I really started engaging in  research and utilizing research to support my painting, spending a lot of  time going into the archives. I   ve got this strong connection with  libraries, anyway. (Laughter) I was doing a lot of reading, looking at old  Smithsonian journals, looking at  Francis  La Flesche   s writings on the  Osage, and what else I could find. I was making these kind of large-scale,  mythological paintings. They were a conglomerate of all sorts of  ideas, mythologies, and things. In a way, it was kind of creating these  mythic worlds. That   s all I can really say. Somewhere within them, I  was in there.  I felt like the paintings were really much more about that feeling of  being disconnected, that somehow psychologically that was something I  was dealing with because Illinois, I spent five years there. I taught there  two years after that, and I   m grateful. I   m thankful for that experience  because it moved my life forward, but I have to admit I did not enjoy it.  I remember calling one of my cousins up one time at home and said,     I   m ready to go home.       You   re not welcome.    (Laughter) He said,     Stay where you   re at. Stay where you   re at. Do not come back home.     The other thing I was going to say was teaching. It was the first time I   d  been in a classroom, and I was teaching a wide range of courses. The  chair of the painting department made sure that I taught, maybe, one or  two courses a semester, so I actually got a lot of experience in the  classroom when I was there. It started off awkward. I have to admit, I  never thought I would be in the role of a teacher, but somehow that   s  just been how my life has unfolded.  Has it enriched your art, do you think, in any way?  Yes. When you   re working with young people, it   s about an exchange of  information. I don   t think of myself as all-knowing, and I would never  want to think that way. To me, a healthy relationship is about a dialogue.  It   s about exchanging information and coming up with solutions and  finding new directions, something that moves that student forward.  What also happens is, as an instructor, that dialogue and that  engagement moves you forward. To me, that   s what I like about  teaching, that when it   s going good, everybody   s becoming enriched.  That was probably the one major thing that I really got out of being in  17  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Illinois.  Also, I think that shift in the work, that I started dealing more so with the  notion of self and identity and place. Landscapes have been a part of my  life and been a part of my work for a long time. Those plein air  paintings, I felt like they were documents of my aimless wandering  around in New Mexico, (Laughter) but finally what happens is that place  became something real, and it was a place embedded with identity and  culture, history.  You mentioned in an interview in 2000 that you   d been painting in  Oklahoma again at that point and feeling kind of isolated. I just wanted  to follow up on that.  I actually like isolation. After my stint at the University of Illinois, I  went back to Fairfax and got me a studio above the police station, which  was actually a good place for me to be. (Laughter) I painted. I just  continued to make work. Part of it was, I thought,    Well, I don   t need an  arts community. I can just paint here.    Part of it was also economics. I  didn   t have a job, so it was easy to go home, cheap studio space, so I did  a lot of painting.  Something happened that I think was really important. I was nominated  for the Joan Mitchell award fellowship  Painters and Sculptors Grant .  Joan Mitchell   s out of New York City. I remember I was in Fairfax. I  got this letter from them, opened it up, and it said,    Submit six slides.     That   s all they wanted was images of your work. Did that, put it in the  mail, sent it back to them. A few months later, I got a letter back from  them saying that I won this fellowship.  That   s fantastic.  Something happened, too, and that was that I realized that home fed me  in a good way, that I could make art anywhere and I could make work  back in Oklahoma. You didn   t need the art world, (for some reason, I  don   t know how to describe it) that there was enough there in that  community for me to make my work. Right at the same time that that  happened, someone called me up and wanted to know if I was interested  in teaching out in New Mexico at IAIA. So that was like a very  important, probably, six months of my life because not only did I get the  Joan Mitchell but also went out to Santa Fe and started teaching at IAIA.  And making some more prints, too?  And making more prints. Being a painter, (I have this discussion with  my colleagues here) painting is a very solitary activity, and you have to  18  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  be in that mindset. It   s different from printmaking, or it   s different from,  say, glass blowing or ceramics where you   re in a shop working, where  you depend on other people to assist with the work. That   s probably one  of the reasons I want to be a painter and a printmaker. I like being able  to go back and forth. I don   t think a whole lot of collaborating that  much, but the printmaker that I   m working with in the last few years in  Santa Fe, we collaborate.  To me, I get to go out three to four times a year for about a week and  just stay engaged in making prints. It   s just the most incredible  collaboration because he   ll look and say,    You can   t do that.    I   ll say,     Why can   t I?       Oh, so it does work.    (Laughter) Sometimes,    Yes, yes,  you   re right.    (Laughter) We talk. It   s like banter about ideas and things.  I worked with this fellow named Mitchell Marty who has a press out in  Santa Fe, outside of town. It   s just been an incredible working  relationship in the sense that   he   s just starting to publish some  lithographs. When we work on the lithographs, it   s not me coming in  with an idea, but I like to present three or four images and we talk about  it.  I go,    Which one are you interested in working on?    As a printer, there   s  a creative element, too. That   s a part of that process, so we have this  long dialogue about it. Then say,    Well, okay. This one. Let   s work on  this one. What are the possibilities?    I think the last set of plates that we  started, we said,    Well, let   s try to keep it to no more than five plates.     We ended up doing seven plates. I think we had close to   it hasn   t been  proofed yet, but we were looking, and,    This is going to have almost  fifteen colors in it.    (Laughs)  Wow  I   d like to talk a little bit about your creative process here in a  minute, but I   d like to ask, in terms of a group show or solo show that  was particularly significant to you, what comes to mind?  Well, I think the Who Stole the Tee Pee? show was a big show to be in.  You want to explain some of the artists and the premise?  To me, it was like a show that sort of encompassed all the important  Native artists who were working at that time period. You had Bob  Haozous, Jaune Quick-To-See Smith. I mean, there was countless others  that I could name. There were artists from Canada, as well. As I said, to  me, I thought it was a really, really great show. I think in terms of  smaller shows, there was a show a number of years ago that Louis  Ballard Jr. and I did up in Chicago, and it was called Pathology of  Symbols.  19  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  It was a show that was done in a very nice location in Chicago. Never  got any press or anything, but it was a show, I think, that really kind of  clarified the direction of the work because Louis and I would sit around  and joke and talk about disturbance, like how there was this disturbance  that exists in our culture and how our culture has been disturbed and  became the catalyst for making images that we were making. So playing  with that. I felt like that was also kind of a summation of all that work  that was done when I was in graduate school, as well.  And Who Stole the Tee Pee?, that traveled, right?  That traveled from     With NMAI  National Museum of the American Indian      Yes, in New York City, and then it went to the IAIA Museum, which is  now the   what is it? It   s got a new name. It   s still the IAIA Museum to  me. (Laughter)  And you did an all-Osage show. Did you enjoy that?  Oh, yes.  In 2006, I guess. Did you go out for that?  No, I actually didn   t. I didn   t. I was trying to remember. This was down  in Norman?  Yes.  That was one of those, I was teaching, and I couldn   t get down at the  time. I was trying to think of some other shows.  It is neat that you guys are so few in number, but you     I think we   re tied together, like Anita  Fields  and Yatika  Starr Fields .  We visit at the dances and that, and Anita and I visit quite a bit as it is.  It   s good.  In terms of your creative process a bit more, you still prefer painting in  oils on canvas when you   re painting?  Primarily oils. I   ve never liked acrylics. Acrylics feel plastic to me, and  there   s something about the oil paint that it   s malleable. You can scrape  it away. It takes a while for it to dry. You can build with it, in a sense. I  20  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  like the notion of an additive and reductive painting process. To me,  painting is not just about adding paint, but it   s also removing and  scraping away and uncovering and revealing.  Like editing, you might come back to your canvas and decide you want  to get rid of some portion or rebalance it.  Exactly, yes, and oil paint, I don   t know, just the feel. I   m pretty much a  dedicated oil painter. When I was teaching at IAIA, because of health  and safety issues, we only taught acrylic painting. I remember when I  left IAIA, I kind of jokingly told the dean, I said,    Yes, I get to teach oil  painting now,    because they all knew. (Laughter) I kept on telling them I  said,    Yes, I   m teaching this, but I really do not like acrylics.    Oil paints  and then printmaking, I mean, primarily, serigraphs and monoprints. I  did a fair amount of intaglio, but monoprints are probably where I   m  focusing more.  Stone lithos are something you   ve also mentioned.  I have worked with stone litho in the past. I don   t think it   s my favorite.  I   m doing lithos now, but basically I   m just doing the imagery. The  printer at the shop is actually doing all the printing. There   s something  about lithography that   as I said, this is kind of new for me now. I   ve  always kind of struggled with the notion of editions. I like single pieces,  so the monoprints have always allowed me to create a smaller original of  what I would call   I wouldn   t use the word unique, but singular works.  When I got into doing monoprints   this has been something that   s been  going on for the last ten years. I did a whole suite of prints back in like  2001, 2002, and I laid off for a while. I think it was about five years ago  I started doing monoprints again. Part of it was I wasn   t really thinking  of them being finished pieces. I was thinking of them as a means of  generating ideas, so the first few suites of prints that I did, they were  very rough. It was just simply about getting ideas down on paper for the  most part.  Then something happened when I was in the shop. I started realizing,     Wait a second. I can take these further,    and I got much more engaged  in the making of them, cutting out stencils, started doing gum Arabic  transfers, reduction printing. All of a sudden, what I found is that I had  much more control over the image. The one thing I didn   t like (and this  is kind of ironic, me being a painter) is I actually didn   t like the  painterliness of monoprints.  When I found that I had more control over the image, I started  embracing it. I found now I   m probably doing more printmaking than  21  Little Thunder  Akers  I   m doing painting right now, but I   m transitioning out of that. Also, the  monoprints that I   ve been doing, they   ve led me to the lithographs  because the printer I was working with was going,    Why don   t you just  do the lithos, because, essentially, that   s what you   re trying to recreate in  your monoprints?    That   s kind of what I   m working on now.  Because of this non-realism, you probably don   t do sketches. Are you  sort of attacking the canvas, playing with paint?  It varies. My approach to painting really kind of depends on what I   m  trying to communicate in the end. I rarely plan things out. When I say     plan things out,    I   m not doing a whole series of preparatory drawings  and then all of a sudden trying to recreate that drawing on a canvas. I  may do a quick sketch of an idea and then sit back and determine,    What  process do I need to approach this to realize that idea?    Sometimes I am  very painterly, and it   s about moving the paint around until I see an  image and then go with that.  I like that relationship between conscious and unconscious image-making.  There   s something that occurs when those two are working  together that creates a fresh kind of work. To me, it also leads to  discovery. A painting is about developing a dialogue. I have a dialogue  with a piece. I   m not copying a piece. And in that dialogue, hopefully  some new conversation, a new direction, a new tangent will occur that  allows me to grow and find something new in the work. I approached  painting that way for a long time.  I think painting is shifting for me now a bit more because when I first  started off, I was doing plein air paintings. I was working from  observation. As I   ve grown as an artist, I deal with more resource  materials. One of the things, (and I say this to my students) when you  understand how to work from perception and looking at nature, looking  at an object, analyzing it, and interpreting it in paint, it informs your  work in a way that when you are working from resource material, you   re  going to have a better grasp of it. If you   ve never had that experience,  you   re not going to know how to translate it because you   re going from  2D to 2D, and that can be problematic.  As I said, the work that I   m doing now, I   m using primarily resource  materials, so it   s a different type of process. There   s a little bit more  planning in it. I don   t know if you can see the painting behind me. I had  to break down and, again, use the grid because I needed to translate that  visual information on a canvas in a somewhat accurate way because a lot  of the iconography that I   m working with today is maps. We assume or  associate that maps are going to have the correct information, so that   s  forcing me to be a little bit more rigorous about how I   m trying to  22  Little Thunder  Akers  communicate information. I have to be a little more specific in a way.  I want to talk a bit about your iconography and your use of symbols, but  let   s just start with maps because, of course, it   s an important tool for a  lot of Native artists in terms of communicating information about  different things post-colonial, a perspective on maps that   s different for  Native people than for non-Indians. Do you want to talk about how you  might use maps differently?  For me, I think maps were about identifying with place and  understanding the boundaries and borders that were being set. Of course,  that   s a whole colonial thing going on. I was fascinated   when you look  at the state map of Oklahoma, the one that   s published by the  Department of Tourism or whatever, it says    Osage County,    but you  look at the Rand McNally map, and it says,    Osage Indian Reservation.     Of course, that   s a whole other issue now, after the court case, but I was  fascinated with that, about how maps name place. The other thing that  occurred to me is that Osage lands extended well up into Kansas, into  Missouri, so the notion of place when I look at a map, it   s very restricted  for me.  I had talked to my colleagues here at KU. I made a comment when I first  came out as a visiting artist. I was driving through the tallgrass prairie  just west of Emporia. Growing up in Fairfax, Osage County, that   s the  southern tip of the tallgrass prairie and Flint Hills. I said,    This is home  to me.    So when I look at the maps that are given to me, I realize they  only show a certain perspective on place.  I tell this story because when I drive home I go down 99. I will turn west  from Sedan. I hop on this little dirt road, and I drive home. I start up in  Kansas, around Hewins. There   s no sign that says,    Leaving Kansas,  entering Oklahoma.    None. I cross, maybe, a paved road, 60, and I can  take another dirt road, and I could end up at my mother   s house. It   s  marvelous because there   s nothing that says I   ve left and I   ve entered a  place.  Maps, to me, they are about colonialism. They   re about defining and  clarifying place, claiming. In my prints, I like to distort maps, and I like  to move the borders around and shift things and make it confusing so  that when someone looks at it, they   re wondering,    Why is Omaha,  Nebraska, next to some little community in Central America?     Something that   s been happening with a lot of my work is about dealing  with and has dealt with personal iconography, personal symbolism. It   s  been very connected to the notion of identity and place and expressed in  a very, as I said, personal way. I   ve found that maps have allowed me to  broaden my conversation.  23  Little Thunder  Akers  A lot of the maps that I   m working with now are of the Americas. We   re  looking at North America, South America, Central America. I think in  the United States when we say    America,    we have a tendency just to  think of us, borders and boundaries. When you look at indigenous  people, as I said, our homes, our memories, and our understanding of  place extends beyond those boundaries that have been prescribed to us,  and the worst thing that could happen is we could agree to live in that.  I mean, let   s face it. The reality is, yes, you have to, in a sense, but it  doesn   t mean you can   t have that understanding of one place to another.  To me, when you move those boundaries around, it   s about  acknowledging that indigenous people have actually have lived all over  the Americas. What   s called a reservation, where we   re put on a  reservation or whatever trust lands we have, that   s just a small portion of  what we had.  Someone told me one time, they said,    How can you have a sacred  place? How can you have a connection?    This was a young man out in  New Mexico. I understood what he was saying. I said,    Well, you know,  we have that, too. We weren   t totally dislocated from our lands.    That   s  why I came to KU, because to be connected or close to Missouri, to be  connected to Kansas, that   s still our homeland, or it was our homeland.  We still have a memory of that place, a blood memory, that ties us to the  landscape. It   s the tallgrass prairie. I chat with my sister, and she   ll say  the same thing. One of the most beautiful places on this earth is that area  west of Pawhuska, going to Pawhuska, to Fairfax or Gray Horse. That   s  it. There   s nothing any better.  I   ve read what you   ve said about your particular mix of symbols and  iconography, and Shanna Heap of Birds wrote about it a bit. You   re  using some things that symbolize different elements of Osage stories or  culture, and you   re using other Western symbols, mixing them all. Is one  of your goals to sort of bring people into your personal iconography, or  is it to let the viewers free associate?  It   s kind of a mix of both. To me, as an artist, I particularly enjoy  creating narratives. Exploring narrative is a part of the painting, and  that   s a part of why I use this iconography. I want the viewer to engage  in the work, but I don   t necessarily want them to see the world exactly  how I see it, that somewhere, when they   re looking at a painting, they   ll  find something that they can connect with on a personal note.  I do want the paintings to inform and enlighten the viewer. It   s kind of  like political art. I struggle with political art that screams at the viewer. I  like political art that   s much more subversive, that somehow engages the  24  Little Thunder  viewer in looking and all of a sudden shifts their thinking without them  knowing it. So, painting, to me, is very much, it   s storytelling. I explore  a lot of iconography, and my iconography comes from a number of  different sources. That   s, I think, just my makeup.  I think that   s a makeup of young people today. I   m looking at Osage.  I   m looking at Western. I   m looking at whatever influences me at that  time. I think about being a part of I   n-Lon-Schka. There   s things that  you hear in there and you   ve heard growing up, and they influence and  they inform how you   re willing to move forward in life.  Then there   s things that you read, like La Flesche. Being an academic  and being in college, I realize that I   m intrigued with past writings. I  think with everything that you get, there   s something suspect about that.  Now, there are people who will praise or condemn, and that   s just  natural. That   s part of it. I try to utilize what I can to make rich  paintings.  I   m definitely not an authority. I would be the first person to say,    I  don   t know anything.    I know what   s been given to me in the sense that  I try to utilize that to make my work. It   s complicated because I think  being an artist when you   re dealing with certain types of knowledge,  things happen. There   s always that notion of things being misinterpreted.  I had mentioned that to you, I think, a little bit earlier, not in this  particular interview. You do deal with that.  I realize a lot of times as a painter, I self-censor myself because there   s  one side of me that   s just simply an artist, and it   s about personal  exploration and expression. There   s another side where you have a  commitment to a community. If you have any sort of awareness to your  obligations to that community, then you become extremely aware of  what   s being said and what you   re trying to communicate.  There   s times where you pull back simply because that information  doesn   t need to be known by someone else. That   s actually what makes  you and your people a unique group. This is a struggle as an artist  because I   m constantly getting questioned about iconography. Some  people, I   m quite willing to share, and other times I   m just very quiet. A  lot of times what happens is someone simply invents something, which  is absolutely the most terrifying kind of experience, and it ends up in  press or something. (Laughter) I think all of those things happen when  I   m thinking about making work. I definitely do not want to offend  anybody from home, but I also want to be an artist, and I want to express  myself in a way that I can.  One of the things I love about your Western symbols, like the lunchbox  25  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  in the top one, is I think they really give a real whimsical quality.  They are.  I wondered if you ever aimed at whimsy in some of these because that  comes through pretty strong with me.  I don   t think about it. It   s funny. I rarely think of myself as being a  humorous person. It just doesn   t seem like my nature, but I do find,  given the chance to kid and joke, yes. I   m around people at home that  constantly, constantly, constantly are always teasing. I do think that  work can   t be serious. I mean, there   s a serious element, but it can   t all  be that. There has to be a plaything.  If you   re not having fun making it, then there   s a problem. Some of the  things that I put in, they may be very serious in my connection to them,  but they may come off as being playful. I don   t feel necessarily  obligated to have to explain that because there   s parts of a work that, as I  said, are simply yours. It doesn   t have to be explained, and that   s it.  There was an elderly lady at home one time. She was looking at some of  my paintings. She is like the age of my grandmother who I never knew,  and I   ve always had a connection to her. I always enjoyed visiting with  her, having a cup of coffee at the caf   or whatever. I remember one time  she looked at the painting, and she said,    I know what you   re painting  about.    These were these large-scale, abstract paintings. I walked away,  and I felt so good because I realized that something was making a  connection. Yes, it just was really good.  That was the best compliment.  That was. No one   s ever   I mean, that   s the best compliment I   ve ever  had about my work, and it simply came from someone from home who  just took a quick look, saw the lunchbox, saw a few other symbols in  there that I was looking at, and kind of went     Can you tell me about your creative process (we   ll keep it to painting)  from the time you get an idea?  Ideally, if things are working for me, I have uninterrupted time in the  studio, but that   s not the reality of being a teacher. (Laughter) I like to  paint. I really have a preference to paint every day and to work four or  five hours a day because, to me, there   s something about that  engagement. I can be obsessive, and I need that to really make a work.  When I   m shifting and I   m breaking and I   m having to get away and it   s  a week or a few days before I can get to the studio or whatever, then it  26  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  becomes problematic, that I always feel like my ideas are changing.  Something new is beginning to enter the picture, in a way, and I find it  much harder to make paintings.  So, ideally, you start one project and see it through.  I   ll try to. I   ve got to the point now where I start to get four or five  paintings in the studio, then I begin to have problems because I start to  slow down because I   m having trouble shifting from one to another. I  think that   s why I like printmaking, is because I   m in the shop and I  know I   ve got a set time to make it happen. Paintings, they   ve ranged  anywhere from the large-scale works   sometimes they   ll happen in a  month. Sometimes it takes a year and a half for them to really be  realized.  In that case, you   re leaving them for chunks of time and coming back.  Yes, so I   ll leave. The piece behind me is one of those. I took it to the  stage that I needed to take it, but now I   m stuck. I   m trying to figure out,     What am I going to do next?    because I really didn   t plan it out  completely. I just simply went,    I   ve got this great idea.    (Laughter) I  found this nice Google Earth image of this old village site in Kansas, so  I simply transferred it to this large-scale painting. I   m doing research.  I   m reading, like  William  Cutler   s History of  the State of  Kansas,  which he wrote in the 1880s. I   m reading accounts of this area, and I   m  trying to find,    Okay, what kind of iconography can I integrate into this  painting that is not just about the past but it   s also about the present?     The iconography that I work with, and one reason why I   m fascinated  with using symbols, is that they don   t function as stop signs. They don   t  simply mean one thing. They have multiple meanings and that the  symbol or the image can convey thought that transcends time. It   s both  about the past, it   s about the present, ideally something that   s  connecting, that   s going to allow you to move forward with your life. I  think about that a lot when I   m painting because the last thing I want to  do is to simply just recreate the past. That   s not what it   s about.  We   re going to have to take a look at that unfinished one, too, here in  minute. Looking back over your career so far, what   s been one of the  high points? You might have mentioned it.  I think the high point is the fact that I   m still able to do it. (Laughter) I  mean, I can   t really think of anything. I   ve been very fortunate, and  there   s been a lot of things. I did the print project with the National  Museum of the American Indian and the Art in Embassies Program.  That was, I think, 2006. They did a little reception for us at the Blair  House. I got to meet Laura Bush, the First Lady. It was fun. It was one  27  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  of those nice   you know what I mean. It was nice.  The embassy exhibit traveled, also, internationally?  It   s traveled, and it   s going to different venues, consulates and that, all  over the world. I don   t know if it was the reception as much as simply  being a part of the project. That   s turned into   there   s been a lot of  interesting things happen out of that. I had a friend who emailed me a  while back, a few years ago, and he said,    I happened to see one of your  prints in a consulate in Germany. I was getting my visa renewed.    He  was living overseas at the time, so it reconnected with someone. I think  it   s just the fact that I   m still able to do it. That   s the main thing. I don   t  get real excited about   it   s another thing.  How about one of the low points?  Oh, boy. As an artist, I think you put a lot of emotion, you put a lot of  belief, you put a lot of yourself into your work. When I finished up the  work when I was in Illinois, I was real discouraged. There was  something about painting about dislocation that really bothered me. I  looked at all that work   this actually might be my high point. (Laughs) I  looked at all that work, and I didn   t believe in it anymore. It was five  years    worth of work. Then I started making paintings about home in a  different light. Do you see what I   m saying?  Wow, yes, it was a big fork in the road.  It was the shift. Part of it was about losing faith, in a sense, as an artist.  I   ve always felt fortunate, extremely fortunate.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about before we do look at some  of your artwork?  I feel like we   ve talked about quite a bit. (Laughter) No, I think   no,  I   m fine.  Okay. We   ll take a look at some of these paintings and prints. We   re  looking at the painting that I know is in progress. It   s not completed, but  do you want to talk a little bit about it?  Sure. One of the things that happened when I moved to Kansas, I started  thinking about the Osage people, our history to Kansas, the fact that it  was our former homelands. I started doing some research, looking for  old village sites and trying to find whatever information I could. I was  looking at an old history book, Cutler   s History of  the State of  Kansas,  which was written in the late 1870s-   80s, I think. I may have to clarify  28  that to be sure. I was reading these physical descriptions of places where  we lived. The book itself was broke up into, like, original inhabitants  and then settlers. I thought it provided a very interesting historical  perspective on place.  But as I was doing that, I started thinking about,    Where are these  sites?    and began to research them, looking at whatever materials I  could that gave me an idea as to where these old village sites might be.  So this is one of those. I   ve got a few more that I   m working on, too. As  I said, it is an unfinished painting, but what struck me about it was that I  would take these road trips down to southeast Kansas. I know good and  well that the minute I get in the truck to go down that it   s not going to be  what I think it   s going to be. (Laughter)  There   s something about engaging in the road trip, the memory, and all  of that. You go through these emotions, this excitement,    Oh, boy. I   m  going to reconnect with a place in history.    You drive down, and you  find out,    Oh, it   s a gravel quarry. It   s a plowed field.    And you know  that, but there   s something about making that kind of pilgrimage, that  kind of connection.  I   ve been looking at a lot of different sources, and I   ve identified about  six places that I   m trying to create these paintings from. I   m utilizing  Google Earth technology, maps to discover these places. I think about  that. That   s interesting that now, today, that   s how I   m finding place. It   s  not by car. It   s not by horseback. It   s not by walking, whatever, when  you think of the history of going and leaving a place. So this is one of  those particular pieces.  It   s interesting that I   m finding more and more because I   m dealing with  maps that the computer is becoming like a sketchbook for me. It kind of  came out of an experience one time where I happened to just discover  Google. I really focused in, and I found my house at Gray Horse. I  thought,    Wow, this is interesting. They actually have an image of the  house at Gray Horse that I have.    I thought about this, and I went,     Well, wait a second,    and I kept it at the same scale. I thought,    Can I  move it, step by step? Can I find Roan Horse   s Camp?    which is where  my family comes from.  So I started moving it, like one little bit at a time, at a bit, at a bit. I  would follow this dirt road, then I found this creek. Lo and behold, I  found myself at Roan Horse   s Camp. I thought,    This is interesting. This  is like a new way of navigating space.    And then it dawned on me, too,  that there was no way I could do that unless I had an intimate knowledge  of the landscape of place.  29  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  It   s still the base.  It   s still the base. It   s still the base for doing that, so the paintings that  I   m working on now are trying to utilize more Google imagery and  thinking about how technology plays a role, and how we interpret place,  our own home, as well, because I think there   s a lot of scary things that  are connected with technology, too, and how to utilize it to define home.  Would you like to talk about this print?  Yes, these are a couple of prints that were done in the last year. This one  piece is called Arrival. The other piece is called Pale Bird. As I said,  these are examples of my monoprints, and what you see is quite a bit of  layering in them. I   m working with a gummer to transfer, and then  reduction printing, and naturally utilizing stencils that I   m inking up as a  third technique that I   m working with.  What this does, it allows me to create a stronger composition. It also  allows me to emphasize a sense of depth or that layering. What I like  about the printmaking process in monoprints, in traditional monoprints,  when you pull the image off the first print, you have residue of ink left  over. A lot of times artists can reprint a second sheet, and that   s called  the ghost. It   s a term. They   ll just say that   s the ghost image. I like that  notion of a ghost image because it reflects something about past or  residue from the past. So the printmaking process, to me, it   s a process  that goes back and forth in time. You deal with the past, you deal with  the present, and that layering is what really excites me about this.  I think early on in the interview I talked a little bit about that at certain  times current events affect me and my work. I have to admit that notion  of immigration, the idea of who   s an illegal alien, who   s Native, those  are terms that I   m a little bit at odds with, critically, with what   s been  happening in Arizona and this whole notion of creating a fence because  you realize there were indigenous people that did cross the border into  Texas, into Arizona, California, going back and forth.  In a way, that   s why I   m playing with some of these maps in my work.  That   s why I   m expanding the dialogue to include the Americas and not  just Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, and also realizing that  immigration and that moving across borders is driven by economy.  Everybody wants a better life. It doesn   t matter who you are. We all  want a better life. I   ve kind of been playing with this in a very tongue-in-cheek  way because I   ve got Alexander Hamilton, Grant, and  Washington. They   re sort of floating in these flying saucers like they   re  aliens waiting to cross the border. Of course, they   re also being  welcomed. (Laughter)  30  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  What I find within the print, the print   s all based on stereotypes. They   re  all stereotypes of Anglo people, historical figures, and Indians, too,  because we see this particular image. It   s the typical image that we see,  and that particular image was actually appropriated out of a dictionary. It  was the illustration for the word    tom-tom,    which I was going,    I   ve  never heard a Native person call a drum a tom-tom.    It   s a very playful  kind of image.  The darker print next to it is from, probably, the last series of works. I  started realizing with notions of immigration and everything that there  very much so is a dark side to this whole colonialism. I   m playing and  poking fun with it, and somehow the work started shifting to a darker  pallet. It may be a little bit difficult to see in there, but I   m actually using  ship plans. You may not see it very well in this. Of course, the imagery  is changed to a conquistador.  The birds, to me, have always functioned as a symbol on a number of  different levels, the notion of migration, that birds migrate from one  place to another. Also, we migrate. Also freedom. As a kid I can  remember back at home watching birds, and what fascinated me about  birds was they can navigate a space I could only imagine. There was a  top, a bottom, and all the way around, whereas we   re stuck with gravity.  So this is a couple of the prints.  And you   ve got a woodpecker, a crow     Water birds in there. If you look     That looks like a chain.     there is a chain. The image is actually inside a cathedral if you look at  it, too, so there   s all these different layers that are occurring. I find as an  artist, as I said, I really struggle at times because sometimes my work  will say something or it   ll be very critical of a certain institution, and yet  I find as a person I don   t necessarily completely feel that way. It   s a  struggle that I   ve always kind of dealt with in work. I don   t know if  that   s making sense, but     Yes, sure it does.  It   s for iconography because you realize part of the history   it   s a part  of the history of how you got to who you are. These are a couple of  pieces. I   ve been appropriating a lot of imagery lately. One of the  images I found was this image   actually, I first found the image in, I  think,  Robert  Berkhofer   s book, The White Man   s Indian. It was of a  31  Little Thunder  Akers  Little Thunder  Akers  German or an Austrian wood cut that was done in somewhere like 1506,  1503. I looked at the image and thought,    Wow  This is supposed to be  one of the first real representations of indigenous people of the  Americas.    As I was looking at the print, it was obvious that they were  nothing more than Europeans dressed up as Indians. Full beards, the  poses were very European. They weren   t indigenous. I just found it   s  really intriguing.  At the same time, I kept on thinking,    What   s the most important  element in this piece?    Obviously, first of all, it   s a misrepresentation of  indigenous people. Then it dawned on me it was actually the two ships  on the horizon because that signifies the moment when the world  changed. So that   s something I   m still kind of playing with in my art a  bit more. I always describe it as, that   s the moment indigenous people  discovered the Europeans.  These are wonderful. Is there anything else you   d like to add?  I feel like I   m kind of talked out. I enjoyed the interview quite a bit, an  awful lot.  I appreciate your taking time for me today.  Oh, thank you.  -------  -------
