 Little Thunder  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, April 5,  2012   and I   m interviewing Peggy Tiger as part of the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project for the Oklahoma Oral History Program at Oklahoma State  University. Peggy, you   re the matriarch of a very important art family  for Oklahoma, beginning with your husband Jerome   s famous  contributions to Native art and now being carried on by your children  and grandchildren. Thank you for agreeing to talk with me today.  You   re very welcome.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, right here where we are now in  Muskogee. I grew up in Muskogee and Eufaula.  Did you have grandparents in both places?  No, my family was in Eufaula, but my mother lived in Muskogee,  worked at the hospital there in town. She was a nurse. That   s why we  lived there, but I did finish high school in Eufaula.  That was my next question, what your mother did for a living. That was  probably fairly unusual for her to be a nurse at that time.  Well, my parents were divorced, and, therefore, she needed to earn her  living.  Did you have any brothers or sisters?  I had a brother, but my brother died before I was born.  You   re Cherokee on your mom   s side?  5  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Yes, on my mom   s side.  Did you have a good relationship with your grandparents?  Oh, absolutely, a good relationship with my grandmother. My  grandfather had died earlier. He was a judge in Eufaula, and he was a  fine old Southern man that came from Alabama, married my  grandmother. That   s where the Cherokee blood comes from, was my  grandmother.  What kinds of things did they expose you to, your grandparents?  Well, my grandmother was just an absolute delight. My favorite thing in  the world was sitting and talking to my grandmother when I was a child.  Did she tell you any stories?  Oh, absolutely. Her mother was a fine medicine woman. She was one of  the rare people in those day and times   we   re talking about the early  part of the nineteenth century. She didn   t lose a child. They would send  them when they were sick to the medicine woman in Porum, Oklahoma,  and she would cure them every time.  So all of her children had survived.  Absolutely.  Amazing. What was your first exposure to art that you remember, seeing  a piece of art?  Well, I didn   t know anything. I was interested in horses and didn   t know  anything in the world about art until I met my husband-to-be, Jerome  Tiger. He was just all art.  Sometimes my friends who are Cherokee have said,    We want our kids  to marry Cherokee.    (Laughter) I don   t know if that was your mom or  grandma   s attitude?  They were very pleased I married a full-blood Indian boy. That worked  very well, except the only fault he had was he was not Cherokee. He was  Creek, but better than nothing. (Laughter)  So the first time you stopped and paid attention to art and started  thinking about it was through Jerome?  6  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Yes.  Did you two go to art shows together before you got married?  No, but if he could get a hold of something to draw with, he was  constantly sketching without even knowing what he was doing. It just  happened. That   s how he was.  It came automatically. Did he sketch you?  Oh, yes. Anything that was around him, he sketched.  During those times, did you just kind of sit with him and let him do his  sketching? Did you read, hang out?  I   ve always been an addicted reader my entire life. I was very fortunate.  Some of the best books that I   ve ever read, I read when I was in, like,  third grade because my mother was a very wise woman, and she would  make sure that I had all these terrific books that are still my favorites.  Huckleberry Finn, that   s the best book ever written by an American. I  don   t like Mark Twain because his attitude towards Indian people is  hideous, but I still have to read his books because the man was the best  writer that   s ever come out of the United States of America, I   m  convinced.  In grade school, junior high, up until high school, did you, yourself, get  exposed to any drawing or painting?  No.  Never interested?  I never had any talent whatsoever. I mean, there is talent, and then  there   s me. (Laughter) That   s both ends of the spectrum.  Did you do pretty well in school, though, academically?  Yes. Books are my thing, not art.  When you and Jerome got married, you stayed at home as a homemaker,  sort of, started out.  Yes.  I know my husband was a pretty good businessman when it came to  7  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  marketing his paintings before he met me, but once we met, he wanted  me to take over that. (Laughter) How did it play out with you and  Jerome?  Actually, I wanted to work, but Jerome said he thought it would be a  much better idea for me to go to school, so I did that. I was attending  college   my youngest child was only two weeks old when Jerome died,  so I wasn   t in school right then, but most of our marriage I was going to  school, not full time but going to school.  Was that a hard balancing act?  Not really. I always liked school.  He would take care of the kids and do his artwork?  Yes. He could do his artwork no matter what else he was doing. I   ve  never seen anything like it. (Laughter) He   d be talking to someone, and  he   d be sketching with one hand. When he   d sign the back of a check,  (sometimes I   d sign them) the buyer would be very, very disappointed  and totally horrified because if Jerome signed his name, he   d do an  exquisite painting on the back of the check right under his signature.  (Laughter) Those were checks that were put away.  (Laughs) That   s amazing.  He was quite an amazing character.  For me to be able to get up sometimes when my husband   s been working  and see something that he   s finished, it   s sort of like Christmas.  I mean  It   s just totally awesome, huh?  Do you remember any particular moments when you just saw something  he   d been working on?  Well, he did formulate a whole new way of doing Native American art,  and that was just awesome to see him doing things when there was not  anything in that style in the world because he was inventing it. It was  just really very exciting.  In fact, some of the Native images that he was creating were the first  with those themes that you had been exposed to.  Yes. I never knew anyone so talented. He thought it was the most  amazing and delightful thing in the world that he could make a living  8  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  without working, he thought, but he painted all the time. To anyone, you  would think it was   goodness, the man worked and worked and worked,  but not to him.  When you went to some of the first shows that he had, did he have shows  with Nettie Wheeler?  Oh, Nettie Wheeler just absolutely adored him. She worked with him  constantly. There couldn   t have been anyone better than Nettie Wheeler.  Amazing woman. That was her life, Native American art. To find  someone like Jerome, she was ecstatic.  So, it was all his choices, what he put in  a show  and how he priced his  work, working with Nettie?  Oh, absolutely. That   s how it had to be. He   d give things away. He  wasn   t interested in money. He wasn   t interested in a lot of things that  people would ordinarily be interested in. He had a good time. He liked to  go out and run around with his brothers and so on, but he could paint for  three days and three nights without sleep. He could just go into   well,  you wouldn   t call it a trance. Goodness knows he had to be very wide  awake to do what he did. There was like two very opposite sides of him.  Do you remember one of the first shows that you attended with Jerome  when he was showing his work?  That was at a department store here in Muskogee, Calvin   s Department  Store to be exact.  What was that like for you?  Well, it was just quite thrilling. I was very proud of him.  Were you a little nervous, too?  No, I was too young to have enough sense to even be nervous.  (Laughter) I was only eighteen when I married.  But, also, as an artist   s wife, you always have quite a bit riding on the  success of a show.  Yes, but it all just came so easy. I just thought that was a natural thing.  So even though you didn   t have a lot of extra money, the paintings were  pretty much paying for the basics.  9  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Yes, we did pretty well, all things considered, because he was good  enough that everything he painted, it immediately sold. We did pretty  well because he was so fast. He didn   t hurry. It wasn   t hurrying to him,  but it was just his natural way of painting. He could do one thing after  another. Like I say, on the back of his checks, there   d be a signature and  a intricate drawing.  (Laughs) Oh my goodness, yes, you   d want to frame it and not deposit it.  Do you think that you and the children   two kids, right?  I had three kids, and Chris died. He was murdered.  You and the three children, after Jerome passed away, what were some  of your sources of strength during that period?  Well, to take care of my children and support them. Then, my cousin  Molly Babcock   she   s an attorney in California now, but I grew up with  her. She also lived in Eufaula with her family. Molly and I formed the  Jerome Tiger Art Company to sell prints of Jerome   s work.  What year was that?  Probably about    69. Jerome died in    67. The first place we went was to  Dallas, Texas. Molly would go in and say,    Now, this is the artist   s  widow,     me  standing there like a goon. She would say,    And these are  his beautiful prints.    Well, no one would buy a thing in the world.  One man, I never will forget, he said,    You two ladies are fighting a big  battle with a sharp stick.    We went back to our hotel room, and I said,     Molly, they   re not going to believe that two women can do something  like this, sell art. They   re not going to buy one thing. We   re going to  have to change our whole philosophy. You   re going to have to go in  there as the saleswoman, and I   m going to have to stay at home and  answer the phone and answer questions when people call.     The owner of the company was M. A. Babcock. We didn   t say this is  Molly Ann Babcock, believe me. We didn   t have to lie to one person  because, naturally, they assumed a man was running the company. After  that, it was phenomenal. We sold all over. Absolutely amazing. That  same varmint in Dallas, Texas, that had said,    You   re fighting a big  battle with a sharp stick,    we refused to sell to, and he was furious   Good for you  (Laughs)  We couldn   t even say what we were really doing, though. They thought  we were a very modern kind of company to have that main salesman out  10  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  there, a woman, and to have a woman as knowledgeable as I was about  Jerome Tiger (oddly enough, huh?) on the phone. This went on and on  and on until we decided we could come out of the shadows. That   s when  Molly and I wrote that book, The Life and Art of Jerome Tiger, and it  was the best seller OU Press Publishing Company ever had.  Wow. To this date it set the sales record?  I don   t know what now.  Or, at least, at that time?  At that time, yes, absolutely.  It   s a wonderful book.  It took a long time before we could dare come out of the shadows. That  was just absolutely horrendous what women could not do in those days.  You just could not.  When Jerome passed away, Molly came out for the services.  Oh, yes.  Had he left many unfinished paintings?  No, Jerome was a    sell everything he painted immediately    upon sale.  There was a long waiting list of people to see what he painted. He  created a prolific number of paintings, much more than you would  possibly in your wildest thoughts think that someone could do in that  length of time. He was that fast.  Maybe a piece a day?  Yes, and sometimes totally intricate, creating a whole new style of  Indian art. It wasn   t too shabby.  When you had begun to digest what the situation was, do you think  Jerome was conscious at any point of,    This will provide for my family if  I   m not around   ? Do you think he ever thought about that?  I wouldn   t know. I don   t know.  When did you make that mental decision that people loved his art and  they were going to be asking for his art?  11  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Well, people did not realize just how much of that art there was. That   s  why my cousin and I got together and decided we   re going to have to do  something about that because the man created much more art than  anyone in their wildest thoughts would think possible.  Yet, there were lots of people who still wanted and still loved his work?  Oh, yes, once it was available, there was people all over the United  States, once they were convinced that there were men running this  company. (Laughter) They just had a very knowledgeable person that  would answer the phone, and they had a very knowledgeable person that  was coming to the galleries and bringing the art.  You don   t remember if it was Molly   s idea or yours?  It was my idea. Oh, you mean to start the company?  To start the company.  Well, it started because this guy (his name was Ted Pearsall) came to  Muskogee, and he wanted to handle Jerome   s art. Instead of doing that,  Molly and I got together and we did it, but we almost blew the whole  thing by saying who we really were.  So he approached you first. Had he been a collector of Jerome   s, or he  just had seen his work     He   d seen his work.     and he knew there was something unique there. Who put the money  into the company originally to help you get started printing?  We didn   t have any money, but there was a guy named Bob Lengacher  in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There was Tulsa Litho over there, and they were  one of the best printers in the United States. They were so in love with  Jerome   s art, as someone that was as intelligent as Bob Lengacher would  be.  Did he collect Jerome, too?  Oh, yes, absolutely, so he didn   t charge us one thing until we could pay.  He just would do the prints, and he was the only one that could do those  intricate colors that I was aware of at that time. I   m talking about  nationwide.  Would he have you come up and look at the proofs?  12  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Oh, absolutely.  Did he print from his own paintings, to start with, or how did you gather  the pieces?  We gathered the pieces from different collectors because I would have  knowledge of who the collectors were. They were perfectly willing to do  that because they   d receive money for it, for one thing. Another thing,  they were good people and willing to help.  Oh, so you gave them a small percentage that you earned from the  prints.  Yes.  You created the list of people that had the pieces that you thought would  be good for printing, and then took them to Tulsa Litho?  Yes  How many prints did they produce the first year?  I think we just did like three, but we   d sell out. Then they   d go up in  value, so it was an excellent investment for people.  How did you decide how many to do at a time?  Ordinarily, we   d do fifteen hundred, but then there   d be smaller editions.  Was that a decision you made?  Yes. It was amazing to people. They didn   t realize how prolific he was.  How could they?  That really expanded the audience for Jerome   s work.  Oh, absolutely. The man was twenty-six and one month and thirteen  days old when he died. My goodness, think of what he did  It was like a  person who   d lived a long lifetime, and it was pretty quick at that.  Anybody that can do an intricate little sketch on the back of a check     (Laughs) Where were some of the places that you or that Molly  traveled?  Molly traveled. After that fiasco in Dallas, Texas, I did not travel  13  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  anymore. I said,    We   re not going to do it this way. It   s not going to  work at all.    They thought we were so modern and feminist because I  was the one answering the phone. Here   s one woman that knew  something, and there was Molly out there. Our main salesperson was a  woman. They always thought M. A. Babcock was a man.  As long as it was owned by a man     They assumed. We never lied once. They absolutely knew M. A.  Babcock was a man.  Did they ever ask to speak to M. A. Babcock?  No, because I was good on that phone.  They didn   t need any more information. You were able to fill the orders.  Yes, I was able to fill the orders, tell them about the artist, tell them  about the art.  How long did it take to pay back the original printing investment?  About a year. Those prints sold tremendously well as soon as they had it  in their heads there weren   t a couple women running the show. It was  that bad in those days. Amazing  It   s not like that, thank God, now.  What were some of the places Molly went that were particularly good  sales?  All over. Molly was quite a talker. Like I said, she   s a lawyer, and she  could outtalk a Philadelphia lawyer. (Laughter) No one could have been  better than her. I could not, being myself, do it.  She continued to work as a lawyer?  No, she wasn   t a lawyer yet.  So that was her living, too. It was both your livings.  Yes, both our livings. Her mother was here helping with my children.  That woman was awesome.  Okay, because when you   re running a business out of your house, it   s  hard to take care of the kids, so Molly   s mom would help you.  Absolutely.  14  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Was your mom still around?  My mother died two years after Jerome. She just couldn   t believe how  he could make money. She just thought that was the most amazing thing  that ever occurred.  With artwork?  Yes, with art.  She didn   t have any misgivings about you marrying an artist?  She was horrified at first, and then she was just like,    Praise God      (Laughter) I think that   s what killed her, when Jerome died. She adored  him. She really did.  So you   re running the printing company, you   re selling prints, you   re  continuing to print each year. When did you get this place? Is this a  family place, or did you buy it?  I built this house, not personally, but had it built.  You had it built with money from the art business. It   s a beautiful place.  Well, thank you. Been here almost fifty years.  When did you decide to open the gallery?  Actually, we opened that gallery because then we went into the making  t-shirt business. I never used one of Jerome   s paintings on a t-shirt, and I  never will. We used Johnny Tiger, his brother   s, the guy that   s on that  end of the house. That went over big. We were one of J. C. Penney   s  top-ten suppliers. We were that good.  Wow. You were selling to department stores     Oh, yes, we were selling nationwide.     and different Indian stores and gift shops.  Yes, all kinds of places. I found out I was kind of good at business  because I had excellent products, no thanks to me.  You believed in them because they were good.  15  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Oh, absolutely. They were good. That   s one thing about me, I do know  good from not so good. (Laughter) I was lucky in some ways and  horribly unlucky in others. Some guy that   s only twenty-six years old  and dies, and my son was only twenty-two. It   s just ridiculous.  Murdered. And Dana has Parkinson   s, and Lisa has Parkinson   s, and  Lisa has AIDS. Isn   t that just all so nice?  Dana has often spoken about you as being the main reason that she  found her painting voice.  Bless her heart. Dana is a pet. She really is.  I wanted to talk about the fact that here you have this thriving print  business, and your brother-in-law is an artist, but you   re also seeing  that your children have these amazing artistic gifts.  Oh yes.  Can you talk about when you first started realizing that Dana and Chris  and Lisa, I guess, also drew and painted?  Lisa was a very talented artist, but she just didn   t want to do it. She was  too in awe of her father   s art, so she backed away from it. They were  always quite talented, and my grandchildren are so talented. It   s a  miracle because they sure didn   t get one speck of talent from me.  (Laughter) There   s no one less talented than me.  Well, other kinds of talent.  Well, I know how to read.  Was that part of the reason for starting the gallery? You could have just  stayed in the print business.  Yes. Well, too, I adopted three children, so I had awesome  responsibilities, always. I needed to make money, and I would do it with  things I was particularly interested in. I didn   t want to do something that  didn   t mean anything to me. I never have.  When did you adopt the three children?  Oh, years ago when my children were young. One was a little blind  child, and one was a full-blood Indian boy. Another was the little blind  child   s brother, actual brother. I don   t think I have the right, though,  since they   re not here, to say anything, to really talk about them. There   s  been as many as fifteen people living in this house. I just take in kids,  16  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  not adopting, but     Also foster-parenting a little bit?  Just somehow they   d come, and their parents would give them  permission, and here they were. I mean, that Eddie Chuculate, he   s an  absolutely terrific writer. Won all kinds of awards, been to Harvard.  He   s no dummy. That guy, he   s the only one out of all the people   my  favorite thing was to recommend books to people. He   s the only one that  listened to one word I said. He   d actually read what I   d tell him to read.  (Laughter) Out of all those kids, the only one was Eddie. Now, isn   t that  something?  He spent a couple years here?  Yes, years and years here. He liked it here.  His family was close by?  Yes, but they   d somehow let people come here.  It was a good gathering place.  Kind of a three-ring circus, I guess. (Laughter)  Dana and Lisa and Chris    friends?  Oh, yes. Lord help us, yes.  But these kids who came weren   t necessarily their friends. They were  often just     It was their friends, but then they   d come to live, just move on in. I  must   ve been completely insane. Now it   s only two people living in this  house: myself and my brother-in-law, Johnny. He lives way down here,  and I live way down there, or just the opposite. (Laughter)  You and Jerome got married first, but I understand you had a close  friend who married Johnny?  Absolutely. Carolyn, that one I was talking about. Her ancestors went to  my ancestors    wedding in 1900.  That   s how far back your friendship goes.  Go back to the 1800s.  17  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  When did Carolyn meet Johnny?  She met Johnny because I was with Jerome. Naturally, she   d meet him.  He   d be around, too. Then eventually, they married.  When you started the gallery here in Muskogee, what was your  thought     It wasn   t a gallery then. It was a t-shirt manufacturing company. Like I  say, it won national honors. They were all hand-screened, not sitting  there, drawing them onto t-shirts. They were made with a machine but  not an automatic machine. Someone would have to be right there and do  each one. We had a lot of employees. It was a big old, hardworking     How many employees did you have?  Sometimes fifteen. To me, that   s a lot.  Did any of the kids work or Johnny work at the t-shirts?  Johnny did every one of the designs. I made up my mind, I was never  going to take one of Jerome   s paintings and put it on a t-shirt. He would  have to have been here to say,    Do that.    I wouldn   t have done it on my  own by any means, so he did all the shirts. I could show you some. He  did some beautiful shirts.  Yes, I   ve seen some. They are nice.  I   ll even give you a shirt, if you like.  Oh, thank you. When did you decide to go into the art business? I think  you started out showing some of Dana   s and Chris    work, right, and  perhaps Lisa   s?  Yes, it was just naturally what happened because once Tony and I were  living in the same house, he   d work with them. When there was an art  show, he   d get   you can   t imagine how many friends my children had.  (Laughter) Before an art show it would just be ludicrous. There   d be  people lined up, everyone painting, all these kids. (Laughter)  All their friends?  Yes, absolutely.  And Johnny said that he would take both, the kids and their entries, to  18  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  make sure they entered shows.  Yes. He   d mat them all for them and take them on out to wherever or  mail them out to where they needed to go. It was a very artistic house  and one un-artistic person: me.  But behind the scenes, you   re creating the environment in which this can  happen.  Yes, I totally was that for what they were doing or attempting to do.  Did you work at the gallery once it was open?  Around the clock.  Okay, so you did run the gallery.  Oh, absolutely. That was quite something.  It was different for you because you were used to working here at home.  It was different, but it was   we had huge orders, like from one  company, hundreds of shirts ordered, so we really worked hard. I  worked very long hours there, but it was okay because my children were  there, too. They worked there, also.  Did you pay them?  Oh, yes. Are you kidding? You know what kids are like.  (Laughs) Yes. So you   d pay them per hour or per day? That was their  extra money?  Per hour. It was pretty good salary, actually, I thought. They were good  workers.  How about Dana   s originals and Chris    originals? They were starting to  put paintings in the gallery, too, weren   t they?  Oh, absolutely.  Did you have some shows?  Yes. Sometimes we had shows that were so big that you couldn   t get all  the people in at the same time. They   d have to wait to come in. You   ve  seen that gallery. It   s pretty big.  19  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Yes. Do you remember the first show, when you were showing Dana and  Chris    work?  No, not any one show in particular. I just remember that it was quite  successful. I   ve been very fortunate in some ways and as unfortunate as  anyone I   ve ever seen or heard tell of around here in others, not like  those poor victims of the Holocaust, goodness knows, but pretty bad. I  thought surely it would kill me when Chris was murdered. That   s the  worst.  I can   t imagine.  He was such a beautiful person. When he was in high school, he was  really quite a star on the football team. Every year, freshman,  sophomore, junior, senior, they would vote for whatever girl he was  going to take to the prom. I remember one year, I think his junior year, it  was awful  All these girls were coming here, sneaking in the house. The  door was always unlocked because there was too many people lived  here. It was just nuts  All these girls sneaking up there. It wasn   t ever  that he was taking his own girlfriend, just whoever he picked. They were  just up and down the stairs all night  (Laughter) Chris was a beautiful  young man and delightful. Every year, we   d start going through this big  thing right before selecting the homecoming queen. Chris was one of the  prettiest boys I   ve ever seen. He was just absolutely beautiful and so  kind, so good.  I know he liked boxing. He had many interests Jerome had.  Oh, yes. He was a Golden Glove champion like his uncle and like his  father. As far as Johnny was concerned, they wanted to turn him pro,  and he said,    No way     He never lost but one fight, ever, Johnny ever  did. He was amazing as far as his physical capabilities when he was  young. Jerome wasn   t too shabby either. Like I say, Johnny, when they  wanted to get him to turn pro, he said,    No way      Well, you kind of have to make a choice between your art     He didn   t want to get his pretty face beat up like he would in that level.  Around here in Oklahoma in Golden Gloves, he wouldn   t.  Can you talk about the book process a little bit and when you decided,  again, who suggested it or if you both decided, you and Molly, at the  same time? How did you know?  We just knew then that we could come out of the woodwork and say  20  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  who we were and write a book because it was a done deal. It was very  popular art, and it didn   t matter that there were two women. We wanted  to get that in, for goodness sake.  And it was 1985 or something? Maybe 1990.  I can   t even remember. It was good to be able to do that.  Say who you were. (Laughs)  Say who we were, say that    two women were actually doing this, ha, ha,  ha     Because then, no one objected. Isn   t that awful, to have a world like  that? That   s exactly how it was, though.  But with the book, too, it must be hard to     That book was harder to write than   I swear, I don   t know if I   d ever  started that project if I   d known how much     How did you do it?  Just had to keep after it. After we   d gone so far, I had to keep going. I  owed it to Jerome, certainly. He was so talented, and then people could  see a broad spectrum of his work.  Did you try to work, write every day a little bit, some of your memories?  Oh, not a little bit. We wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote.  Did Molly come out here and stay?  Yes. Like I say, her mother was just a super woman. You can ask  Johnny Tiger. That   s his favorite person on earth is Aunt Lorraine. She  was his teacher when he was in the sixth grade. That is the hardest  working woman that ever lived on this earth, as far as any I   ve seen. She  was just ridiculous in her ability to constantly work. Just loved it . . . .  she   d get you started, and she   d work, and she   d make everyone else  work.  How long did Molly come out and stay to work on the book with you?  Years. She wasn   t here all the time.  She wasn   t here all the time. She   d come for a week or two.  No, she   d come every day. She had a home in Muskogee.  21  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  She   d come every day for a period of three or four months?  Three or four years. No, more like about two years. It was a lot harder  than we thought it was going to be.  Would you just do free writing? How did you     We had a guy here that worked for us that was one of the smartest  people that ever came down the pike. I remember one time I was talking  to someone on the phone, and there was a kid standing next to me  batting on a basketball. It would go,    boing, boing.    I was saying,    Well,  we   re doing really good because Danny is here and he works so fast.     They thought that he was going on the typewriter, but it was this  basketball,    boing, boing.    (Laughter)  So you were generating the material. You were free writing, and then  this person that you hired was typing up?  Yes, he was an old friend from high school.  Molly was acting as editor, or was she writing, too?  No, actually, I ended up writing all of that book except that chapter on  John being born.  It   s a beautifully-written book, so you did a wonderful job.  Thank you. It sure wasn   t something that was done professionally, or I  would   ve certainly finished it a lot sooner than that, I   d think. I mean,  two years, that   s long.  That   s not long for a book, actually.  I guess that   s true.  Was it hard, though, to remember some things?  No. It was hard as far as heartbreaking but not hard to remember. It  would be now. That was awhile back.  OU Press published the book, and they took care of distributing it and  everything     Yes.  22  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger     but you sold it out of the gallery, probably, as well.  Oh, yes. We sold it to our clients. We had a limited edition, leather  bound edition, too. It was five hundred dollars a book. I always needed  as much money as I could get because, like I said, there was all kinds of  children that lived here. Lord knows they didn   t pay rent. (Laughter)  They were all good kids, though.  The limited edition books, the leather bound ones, you only published a  certain amount of them?  Five hundred.  How quickly did they sell?  Pretty fast. They   re gone.  But you continued to sell the book through the gallery?  Well, there   s not any more books, really. We sold out. Unless OU Press  goes ahead and does another edition, that   s it.  Well, they should, probably.  That   s the first big book like that they ever did, big art book like that.  Now they have expanded, and they   re liable to do anything, but they  didn   t then.  That   s a good point that they were really sort of taking a chance on that  book.  Yes, they were.  Did you meet with the publishers, you and Molly, a couple of times?  Oh, Lord, yes. Oh, yes. More than a couple of times. There were times  when we were trying to make deadlines that we were camped up there at  OU Press Publishing Company.  Oh, wow, you had to stay in Norman for a couple of days?  I had those kids, and I   d have to get back. I remember sometimes I  thought,    I   m going to kill somebody on this road, or myself, also,    to  drive back, you know. It was pretty tough, but Aunt Lorraine was always  there.  23  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Were they immediately receptive when you proposed the idea for the  book?  Yes, they were quite receptive because we were doing quite well by  then. We could show them how many prints we   d sold, so they would  assume that they could sell books.  And Jerome   s reputation had just continued to rise. You started taking  classes, when you and Jerome first got married, at Bacone, and you  eventually changed schools and began taking classes at Northeastern. Is  that right?  That was after Jerome   s death that I went to Northeastern. I went to  Bacone some more. I took as many hours as I could take at Bacone, but I  didn   t graduate from there. I just took as many hours as I was allowed  there. Then I went to Northeastern and graduated and received my BA at  Northeastern State University. Well, it was Northeastern State College in  those days.  In what field?  American studies.  Was this also while you were working the prints?  No, it was a little after.  Then you went to work for Cherokee Nation?  I went to work at the Cherokee Nation in 2004, and it was a job from  heaven.  What was your job?  Well, I had to read, then write about what I read. It was just too much to  bear almost. (Laughter)  Was it connected with Cherokee history?  Oh, absolutely. I had to go and dig in the archives. You can imagine how  that distressed me. (Laughter)  And then they were going to use the research for     For various things, and I   d get to write about them. I   d get to do our  monthly report for different divisions, what they   d done for the month. I  24  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  love to write. That wasn   t difficult writing. It was interesting writing.  Everything I did there   if I had to, as a wealthy woman, which I   ve  never been, I would have paid them to let me do that kind of work. It  was that delightful to me. It just broke my heart after that car wreck. I  was in the hospital for six months and almost died, but it was awful to  lose that job.  And then to have to come back, working your way back physically to  being more active again.  I   m never going to be very active. I was in perfect physical condition  because I used to jog every day, twelve miles. You talk about in good  shape, I was.  You used to jog out here in the country?  Yes, over there, there   s a circle where I   d jog and then sometimes the  park in town. I was in perfect shape. You can imagine. I can   t even walk  without a walker now, and I used to go twelve miles a day. I   m not  lying   When you and Jerome were together, that was something you shared,  too, I guess, was love of athletics. Did you love athletics in high school?  Oh, yes, absolutely. I was never good at athletics like to hit something  with a paddle, like play tennis. Not good at that, but I was always very  fast. I learned by talking to doctors. Somehow I learned that I was  amazing in that I never got hurt and I could go that far, as far as running  and jogging.  When did you take that up seriously, the long jogging?  It wasn   t anything really serious. Well, actually, I did win medals and  stuff.  Tell me about that.  By the time I was entering things, naturally I was going to win because  of my age. I was up there high enough to where there weren   t many  people in my division, so I did well.  Were you in the Tulsa Run, ever?  Yes, any place where there was running.  You started in your late thirties?  25  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Oh, later, but when I was a child, I ran constantly. I was a tomboy, and I  ran with a group of boys, and we ran from morning until night. That   s  when kids used to be turned out for the day. I don   t care how strict or  care where their parents was, that   s what happened in those days. That   s  a long time ago. I think I built up something I could call on later, in  those days, because I ran with this little gang of boys and we ran all day.  Then, when we were having a great crisis in the Cherokee Nation, I ran  with the chief of the Marshall Service over there. You cannot imagine  what a horrible fiasco that was. I was gone off those steps, and if  someone hadn   t caught me, at the Cherokee Nation    It was just an  absolute horror show for quite some time, but then our people got in.  Then I ended up going to work there, and, like I say, it was a job straight  from heaven. Imagine, giving me pay to read.  And you still read a lot.  All the time, if I   m not sitting here talking. The next book I   ll read will  be this little darling.  Yes, you mentioned that. This is called Elizabeth   s Women, and you  admire Queen Elizabeth.  More than anyone in all of history.  Why?  Because in a time when it was totally a man   s world, she kicked ass   (Laughter) The woman, although she adored men, she could not have  sex with anyone her whole entire life. In my own mind   this is one of  those questions from history that people argue continuously: Did  Elizabeth die a virgin? I think she did. How could she do otherwise?  It was too dangerous if she wanted to keep her     Yes, and the woman could speak everything from Russian on around the  corner. All those years, she was so intelligent that she kept people from  attacking England because they thought they   d get it an easier way.  They   d marry Elizabeth. Everyone came courting, except guess what?  Surprise. (Laughter) I mean, that   s awesome, isn   t it?  It is awesome. You   ve kind of talked about some of the low points, but  I   m wondering, what have been some of the high points of your life so  far?  26  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Well, it was a delight to be married to Jerome Tiger. He was fun, and my  whole life had gone so right. It was like this horror that she   d married  this Jerome Tiger.    How is he ever even going to support her?    That   s  when women usually didn   t work. Wow  It was awesome  Made darn  good money, just absolutely totally talented. My life was an absolute  delight.  And willing to do part of the work and watch the kids, and he wanted  you to be able to develop your talents.  Oh, yes, absolutely, insisted I go to school. That was very nice because I  liked school. (Laughter)  I can   t really think of anybody whose life has revolved, has been   as you  say, you, yourself, don   t do art, but your life has revolved around art  and artists. What is it about art, do you think, that we just really need?  It   s just because I got to know Jerome Tiger, and he was just like artist  personified. I do have enough sense to totally appreciate greatness and  feel it   s comprehensible to me. His favorite artist was Michelangelo, and  he   s always been mine, too. The funniest thing is, when they redid that  Sistine Chapel ceiling, they finally found something that could be used  to see what   s really up there because they certainly couldn   t wash  anything off it. That same color was one that Jerome invented over here  in the United States that Michelangelo used  God as my witness, you  look at both.  What color was it?  It   s a lime green. Now, how about that, huh?  Wow, that is something.  That came about when they finally found something that could clean it  without hurting it at all, after Jerome was dead. But lime green. That   s  the kind of green you never     You must   ve both discovered Michelangelo together, then, from when  Jerome got interested.  Somehow Jerome managed to discover Michelangelo. He never knew  that he used that lime green. It certainly took him away. He was  absolutely his favorite. Mine, too. My own, too. I just get cold chills  thinking about what he did, like that David and that Piet  . Good Lord.  Jerome   s sculptures, you got to see, as well.  27  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Little Thunder  Tiger  Oh, yes. He was a heck of a sculptor. The worst thing he did, though,  was he did three, and then he decided it would be fun to use them for  target practice because he had to work with something to make sure he  could hold the clay together. He knew how to do it somehow. He did not  want to do this whole big sculpture and have it crumble because he was  making some kind of little mistake. Anyhow, the oddest thing, though, is  that lime green that he and Michelangelo used, and Jerome didn   t know  that he used that.  That   s pretty amazing. Well, is there anything else you   d like to share, or  anything we haven   t talked about?  No, I think you   re very interesting to talk to. Of course, I   m doing all the  talking, but I   m sure if you were doing the talking, you   d be quite  interesting, yourself.  Well, I   ve really enjoyed it. Thank you, Peggy.  Yes, you   re very welcome.  -------  -------
