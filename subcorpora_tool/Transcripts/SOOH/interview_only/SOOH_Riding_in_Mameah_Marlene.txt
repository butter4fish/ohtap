 Little Thunder This is Julie Pearson Little-Thunder. Today is Wednesday, October 28,  2015. I   m interviewing Marlene Riding in Mameah for the Oklahoma  Native Artist Project at the Oklahoma State University Oral History  Research Program. We are out in Marlene   s home in Pawnee. Marlene,  you are Pawnee, you   re one of the first Native women in Oklahoma to  make German silver jewelry. Your art has been worn by champion  powwow dancers from all over. You also do finger weaving. You   ve  shown at the Southern Plains Indian Museum and were the Honored  One at the Red Earth Indian Arts Festival in 2007. Thank you for taking  the time to talk with me. Where were you born and where did you grow  up?  Mameah I was born on the home place, which is located south of Yale, next to  the Cimarron River, so I always say I was born on the Cimarron River.  Little Thunder What did your mother and father do for a living?  Mameah My father was a farmer and my mother was a housewife.  Little Thunder Brothers or sisters?  Mameah I had three brothers and two sisters.  Little Thunder Where did you fall in the sequence? Where did you come in?  Mameah I was the baby.  Little Thunder How about your grandparents on either side of the family? What was  your relationship with them?  5  Mameah I didn   t know my grandfather on my father   s side, I didn   t know my  grandmother either, but I knew my great-grandmother on my father   s  side. On my mother   s side, my grandmother and my grandfather was  actually my step-grandfather, but I didn   t know that until I was thirty  years old. When he died, they told me he wasn   t my grandfather and I  didn   t know that. They were the only ones that I knew growing up that I  had   grandparents.  Little Thunder Were you around the language a lot growing up?  Mameah Yes, because my grandparents, they know how to talk Pawnee, but I  wasn   t around them enough. They lived up here and we lived down  around Yale. I would only see them on the weekends because we would  come up here every weekend. Visit one   stay with one family one  weekend, the next we   d go to the other one, stay with them. But I was  never around them enough to understand or know the language. My  father and my mother used to use the language to keep secrets from us,  so we just never did learn. They never taught us. We knew some words,     sit down,    and    get up,    and    behave.    Mostly,    behave      things like  that.  Little Thunder Right. Did you have any extended family members who were involved in  the arts?  Mameah I can   t remember any. Do you remember any?  Donna Do you claim Caesar?  Mameah Oh.  Little Thunder This is Donna speaking. That   s okay.  Mameah Julius Caesar, he was my father   s nephew. He was a fantastic  silversmith. He called it a metalsmith.  Little Thunder Right, so did you see some of that work as a young girl?  Mameah Oh yeah. He was always around and he was really friendly. He was  always giving things away that he   d made. He was always giving my  mother earrings, so she had some of this work.  Little Thunder Neat. What is your first memory of seeing Native art?  Mameah My first memory   I imagine it was out at Chilocco, when I went to  school up there, because that   s the only time I was around art that I  could remember. Going in school   drawing pictures and all like that,  6  but up there you got to see Indian art and so many things that I didn   t  know anything about, you know, other tribes. I was in arts and crafts  and that   s where I started. I started drawing. The teacher knew that I  had the talent to draw. Our teacher was   what   s her name? I can   t think  of her name now, but she was from out west. I don   t think she was  Navajo, she was something else, but she was a teacher up there and she  did weaving on the boards. Not the loom, it was just a board. She taught  me that. The rag rug weaving, we did those. She noticed I had an  aptitude for that, so she started me on the loom.  I used to weave afghans and table cloths, napkins, and the school would  sell them. They would have them there for sale for people that came in.  That   s where I learned to do weaving. And then when Mrs. Wapp came,  she taught me to finger weave. That   s where I got my start. She  encouraged me to paint and I did. I think it was the dean, the president  of Bacone College. He came up one year and he went through the arts  and crafts department, and he noticed what I had been doing on my  artwork, so he got my name and address from Mrs. Wapp. She told me  that he was real interested in me going to school down there. They  wrote me a letter, so I showed it to my father, and he always  encouraged my artwork. He was the one that was always behind me.  That   s why he sent me to Bacone.  Little Thunder Now when did you go to Chilocco and how old were you when you went  to Chilocco?  Mameah I went to Chilocco I think it was in    47 to    49. Then I went to Bacone  for one year. Then I started again, but then I quit.  Little Thunder What was it like at Bacone when you got to that program?  Mameah That   s why I went, was for the Indian art. Dick West was the teacher. I  was just fascinated by all the Indian art. When I got there   in the class  he made us all sit around and told us to draw something for him. I drew  a war dancer. He walked around, he looked at everybody and he pointed  to me and he said,    You, upstairs.    So I went upstairs and then he came  up and he showed me how to transfer   he wanted me to do what I was  doing and to correct all the mistakes in it. Showed me how to correct  the mistakes and to transfer it on to paper. So that was the start.  Little Thunder And I as I understand, he sent you upstairs because you were doing  Indian art and he saw the talent. The other students were just doing  some regular, some kind of regular   regular assignments.  Mameah Yeah, because I was mostly Indian, everything was Indian to me.  7  Little Thunder I think I also read that you wanted to take jewelry making when you got  to Bacone.  Mameah I did. When I found out they had that program, I wanted to take it, but  they wouldn   t let me because they didn   t let women do it.  Little Thunder Do you remember who was teaching the jewelry making class?  Mameah Dick West. But he said it wasn   t part of the program and that the school  didn   t want women taking that course, so I didn   t get to take it. But I  fooled him. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Yes, you did. Anyway, you got encouragement from him for painting I  guess, so is that what you continued to do at Bacone?  Mameah Yes. That was what I did. I don   t know, he just really took an interest in  me because he thought I had the talent to do it. Acee Blue Eagle lived in  Muskogee, and he would come out to the school. When he heard I was  Pawnee   well, he knew my parents. He had met them and then he   d  heard that a Pawnee was going to school out there, so he came out. First  thing he told me,    I know your parents.    Anyway, he helped me, both  of them. Dick West took art from Acee Blue Eagle. That was his  teacher. It   s kind of funny. I learned from both of them. Acee was  always bringing books out for me to read, to look at, and to copy. He  would make me draw things that was in the books that pertained to  Pawnee. That way he said I   d have a record of everything. Then I   d  have to write down everything. He was a big help to me. Then they  wanted me to enter that art contest at Philbrook that year. Well, I didn   t  know what to paint, so Acee brought a book out and it was about  Pawnees. He said,    Read this book and take a picture out of this book.  Paint it, draw it.    I didn   t know what I was doing, so I latched onto this  Morning Star ceremony that they had in there. I had one little part there  that I drew. It was actually just a dance. I finished it.  They   re tell me how to paint any everything, and mixing paint. How to  use lines   they didn   t shade at all. It was flat, but there was a way you  put shade, using different colors, blending them. They taught me that.  They entered it into Philbrook and it won First Place in the Plains  Division. I was the youngest one to ever win there in all of the  divisions. I think I was seventeen   I was sixteen when I painted it. I  was seventeen when I entered it because my birthday was in March. I  think it   s in April was when that contest was. Anyway, after I won I  told my father about it and he wanted to know what I painted. I told him  and he got mad. He told me that that Morning Star ceremony was not  part of the Pawnee, it was Skidi. He said,    Don   t you ever paint  anything about the Morning Star ceremony again.    If you want to know  8  about Pawnees,    he said,    You talk to me about it and I   ll tell you. You  want to know our ceremonies? The ones past and dances, you just tell  me and I   ll tell you, I   ll show you.    So I did after that. This painting  over here is one that he wanted me to draw, The Doctor Dance. I did  that in two weeks. I should have taken a lot longer than that, but I was  in a hurry, so it   s not actually up to my standards. I mean it looks     Little Thunder It   s beautiful, though. A lot of figures in there.  Mameah Yeah, Indian art in itself was not pretty. I mean, the faces were  ferocious. They weren   t good looking people that they painted. I don   t  know, the figures were a little different than what you would do  nowadays. What I do now is a whole lot different, but Indian art was  just flat. So you had to go with what you had, what you could. This one,  I entered it at Philbrook. I didn   t win anything, but they wanted it to go  on a tour. It was gone for a year or two and I   d forgotten all about it.  Then one day they delivered it to the house. I didn   t know what it was  until I opened it.  Little Thunder You were back in Pawnee at that point?  Mameah No, I was living in Skiatook  Oklahoma .  Little Thunder You were at Skiatook, okay.  Mameah I was married and living in Skiatook when I did this. I just went home  so that he would be there to tell me what to do and to okay it.  Little Thunder Did you meet your husband at Bacone?  Mameah No.  Little Thunder Okay, how did you get from Bacone to Skiatook?  Mameah I met my husband. Got married   they lived in Skiatook so I went to  Skiatook.  Little Thunder Were you thinking at that point you wanted to continue painting?  Mameah I wanted to, but then again, I didn   t. I mean, I didn   t have much interest  in painting at that time. He was trying to farm. He actually was a city     grew up in the city. Never had farmed or anything. He was a veteran,  and his mother had some land out there that he wanted that had house.  He wanted to live there and try to farm. Being a farm girl, it was right  down my alley. So I helped him. My dad gave us a tractor. We lived  there until his father died. When his father died, we moved into town to  9  take care of his mother, to stay with her. I didn   t do any artwork. I just  did little pieces. When people found out that I could draw, they   d want  me to do a painting of something for a certain thing, so I would do that.  Then I got into ceramics and then I did the little lamps of Indians, you  know? It was a decanter, really, and it was real goofy-looking decanter.  I kind of shaved it off, took things off that I didn   t like, and painted  them and made lamps out of them. I used to sell those. Then somebody  wanted me to start painting plates just to hang on walls, so I did plates  with a straight dancer and a buckskin dress, they were in pairs. That was  about all the artwork that I did.  Little Thunder Did you sell those to individuals or did you sell to the store over there?  Mameah No, I sold them to people who ordered them. They would call me or  come by the house and want me to do different things. Draw something  for them, or like that painting over there that went on the cover of a  powwow book. I had another one out, but I never did get that back.  Another powwow book.  Little Thunder How did you get involved with Supernaw   s?  Mameah I met my husband at a stomp dance and that was it. That was the  beginning.  Little Thunder (Laughter) You were captured. Then you went to work for the Supernaw  Indian Store, right?  Mameah It was after my husband died.  Little Thunder Okay.  Mameah Kugee wanted   actually hired me to draw patterns, so that he could  make the object.  Little Thunder For jewelry?  Mameah Yes.  Little Thunder Okay, for his jewelry.  Mameah I would draw like the earrings, then he would cut them out and make  them. I didn   t like that too well, but I started doing it myself and he  found out that I could work with metal.  Little Thunder You were watching. Is that how you learned? From watching him  work?  10  Mameah Yes, and then after I started working   well, he showed me how to use  different stamps or tools that you use. Just basic information on how to  do metalwork. After I learned that, I just took off from there. Like these  hair ties, here it   s actually based on a beaded hair tie. Pam Chibitty had  a lot of beads missing out of her hair tie, so she wanted me to replace  the beads because  Supernaw   s  did a lot of beadwork, too. When I was  replacing the beads I thought,    Why can   t I make a hair tie out of  these?    So that   s how that started.  Little Thunder Okay.  Mameah I just made my own patterns. I worked there four years for him and then  I met my second husband. He was actually my cousin   s nephew by  marriage. She was married to his uncle. When I married him that made  her   no, that made me her aunt   no, her my aunt. She was my aunt.  That   s how it was, and we were cousins. That was so crazy. But after I  married Ace, well, he was disabled. He had rheumatoid arthritis real  bad. And I continued   by that time, I was working on my own.  Little Thunder Jewelry.  Mameah He wanted to help me and he tried, but he couldn   t cut out metal, or he  just didn   t have it. Some people can do it, some can   t, but he could  finish. He did the polishing and all that to finish whatever I made, and  that really helped me. I didn   t have to do all the hard work.  Little Thunder It   s real time-consuming, isn   t it?  Mameah Yeah.  Little Thunder Were you selling mainly at powwows at that point?  Mameah Yeah, and then we were invited to different   what are they? What do  you call them? Conferences? And those big gatherings like that. Then to  tap powwows, so we would travel to sell. We traveled all over the  United States doing that, and that was a lot of fun.  Little Thunder Where was the most   what was one of your most exciting travel  adventures? Maybe out-of-state travel?  Mameah Gosh, I can   t remember.  Little Thunder Or just a place that you enjoyed going to that was out of state?  11  Mameah Going to Connecticut and seeing that river. I can   t remember the name  of it. To me, that was the biggest river I   d ever seen and we crossed it  going into White Plains, New York. We were both afraid to go into  New York City, you know, all the traffic and everything. So we  bypassed that and went around to White Plains, then cut across to go to  Connecticut. I think that was the best trip because I   d never been up  there and I   d always read about different things. That river, to me, was  the most exciting. It was so big compared to the rivers that I   d seen     and being born on a river   next to the river.  Little Thunder So in terms of when you were first starting to show your work, you  started off right away with German silver. Is that right?  Mameah Yes.  Little Thunder Do you want to explain the difference between German silver and some  of the other metals? Regular silver?  Mameah The difference? German silver is actually a nickel-silver. I don   t know  why they call it German silver outside of   when they first started  bringing it over, it came from Germany. They brought things that were  made for uniforms, the buttons, and gorgets, and all of those. It  fascinated the Indians and they wanted it. So they got to trading. They  found out   the white people found out that the Indians wanted that, that  was a good trade product. They would take all the silver that they got  from England and carry it with them and the Indians would trade for it.  It worked its way down to the Plains. When they found out that they  could get the German silver, then they started making it. Sterling, it was  too expensive, and it   s too fine. It wouldn   t last very long. Where this  German silver would last forever when you wear it. But with sterling, it  wears. It   ll wear out.  Little Thunder You explained that some of the Navajo jewelers that you would show  around had an attitude toward German silver.  Mameah Oh, they didn   t like German silver. They would say things about     laugh about German silver. They   ll come by our table and look at it and  make a face, say something about it. Like it was degrading. I didn   t like  it. Because they did that, I avoided them. That   s why I never went to the  Indian Market was because the way that they had treated the German  silver and talked about it. I just figured they didn   t want it there, so I  never tried to go and I was invited to go there. I just wouldn   t do it  because of that. The one thing   I   m a traditionalist. I stuck with it  because I   m a Plains tribe and Southern Plains is all I do. I think sterling  and turquoise should be   that belongs to them. That   s their type of  work. I respect it and I always wish that they could respect the Plains.  12  Little do they know that they took a lot of our Plains    patterns because  the conchos actually came from the Plains and different other articles.  They were Plains   what we wore   and they would copy them. I think  they   re well known for copying, anyway.  Little Thunder You mentioned that you mostly sold to dancers. I was wondering   it   s a  different kind of satisfaction maybe than selling to people who aren   t  dancers. Can you talk about that a bit?  Mameah It didn   t matter. If you wanted to wear what I made, that was good. I   ve  had people come by and say that they inherited stuff and they were very  proud of it. Whoever wanted to buy what I made, it was good, I was  glad. But I actually made objects for dancers. A lot of times, these little  ones would come up, and they would be beginning dancing and I knew  their parents didn   t have a lot of money to dress them, so I would give  them little things to help them along. And they would be real happy,  these little kids. Just a pair of earrings, something like that, or  armbands. That   s what I made and to me it was usable. I see it now, to  this day. I see people wearing them, the articles that I made. They   re  still using them. Just like Julius Caesar   s work. Anybody that has his  work should be very proud of it because he made it and it   s been  handed down all these years. That   s what my husband used to say. He  said,    This is going to last forever. Long after you   re gone, your  jewelry   s going to be around, it   s going to be used and that   s good.     Little Thunder What do you think distinguished your work from maybe other people  that made things in German silver? What made your work a little bit  different, your German silver work, from maybe another worker that  was working in German silver?  Mameah What made it different? There   s one thing, I made my own patterns. I  never copied because I could draw and make my own patterns. I   ve  seen a lot of my patterns being used by other people.  Little Thunder (Laughter) After you came up with them.  Mameah But that   s to be expected.  Little Thunder Did you enter any competitions with your jewelry?  Mameah Yes.  Little Thunder What   s an important award that you got early on? One that you   re  proud of?  13  Mameah Probably Red Earth. I   ve won there several times. Then the Honored  One  at Red Earth . That was the biggest one.  Little Thunder That is really special. What was that like when you found out about  that?  Mameah When they called me, they asked me if I was sitting down (Laughter). I  was working and I told them,    Yes, I   m sitting down.    She said,     You   re picked to be the Honored One.    It didn   t quite   I thought she  was kidding. I thought somebody was joking. I just laughed. She said,     No, no, it   s real. You really are.    I said,    You   re kidding?       No.    Then  it dawned on me, it really was and I just couldn   t believe it. Me?  (Laughs) I knew I was old enough   not like  your husband , Merlin   Little Thunder . But yeah, it was quite an honor to know that they did  pick me, to know that they enjoyed my artwork that much.  Little Thunder And you rode in the parade right? Were you in the parade?  Mameah No, I was on a walker then and I couldn   t get around too good. Then it  started raining, so I got out of it. (Laughter)  Little Thunder How did you figure out how to price your work?  Mameah Actually, my work was underpriced according to everybody. They said  I was cheap because they would say,    Oh, so-and-so   s got this and  they   re that much higher.    I never tried to put a big price on anything  because I was selling to the Indians, and I knew they didn   t have a  whole lot of money. I tried to keep it down to where people could afford  it.  Little Thunder What was one of your favorite things to make?  Mameah Favorite thing? I don   t know that I     Little Thunder Or maybe a difficult thing to make?  Mameah Okay, the difficult one is what I was thinking. The gorgets, they were  kind of fascinating to make. They were big and you had to figure out all  your stamping, how to get it in, what pattern, how you could get your  pattern worked in. It was kind of mindboggling at times, but I managed.  Little Thunder They really show.  Mameah Yeah, and what is his name? He   s a collector. I always called him Dr.  Bill. Bill Wiggins?  14  Little Thunder Bill Wiggins, is it? Bill Wiggins?  Mameah Yeah, he   s got this scrapbook full of everything he   s collected through  the years. He   s got like four full pages of my artwork in there of things  that he   s bought from me. I was surprised when he showed it to me that  he had that many things. I knew he was collecting, but I didn   t know he  was collecting that much. I know as soon as he come in, he   d come to  the table and pick out the best thing I had, the newest thing, and he   d  buy it.  Little Thunder I was going to ask you, what were some of the pieces that you won on?  Was a gorget one of them?  Mameah One was a cross. It was a large cross to be worn by a man dancer. It was  cutout, a lot of cutout. On the four sides, there was cutout water birds  were cut out on each end. I forgot what was in the middle, but that one  was, I think, to me, the best thing I made.  Little Thunder That was at Red Earth, wasn   t it?  Mameah Yes.  Little Thunder I think I remember that piece. Beautiful. You had a show at Southern  Plains Indian Museum as well. Do you remember the year  approximately?  Mameah Two thousand and 2001.  Little Thunder What was that like?  Mameah Actually it was   I wanted to go, but my husband was in the hospital at  that time. I was staying up to Oklahoma City with him and I didn   t want  to go, but he talked me into going. He said,    You have to go, you have  to be there.    So I went reluctantly. It was good, but I was so worried  about him that I couldn   t enjoy it, really. I wanted him there with me.  But I was so glad when my niece and her mother showed up.  Remember that?  Donna At Red Earth?  Mameah No, at Southern Plains, Anadarko.  Donna Yeah, I remember that.  Mameah Then we all went to the hospital, afterwards. They stopped by to see  him. Friends of mine had wired flowers. So they boxed them up and we  15  took them up there to him. But it was a good show. A lot of people  came, a lot of people bought. They said that that was the most  productive show they   ve had.  Little Thunder Is that right? The best sales show? Yes, he sounds like he was such a  good supporter of your work.  Mameah Yeah.  Little Thunder Was he the sales person at the booth, too?  Mameah He was. I used to say I was production and he was sales, but you had to  know him to know that he could sell. I seen a woman, she was standing  way back, all hunched up, just real shy. He kept telling her,    Come to  the table and look at what we   ve got.    He kept talking to her and finally  she came to the table. I mean he talked to her and talked to her, and it  just seemed like she blossomed. She started laughing, she straightened  up. I could see the difference just with him talking to her like he did.  Little Thunder So you saw how that young woman just blossomed?  Mameah Yes, it was really something to see. That   s the kind of person he was.  He   d make friends with anybody, talk to anybody. I don   t know,  everybody liked him. He was just a person like that. You couldn   t  dislike him.  Little Thunder How would you describe some of the changes at the Red Earth Indian  Arts Festival over the years?  Mameah How the changes were at Red Earth during the years? It started falling  off. The dancers, people quit coming because you had to pay to get in  and all they did was contests. They couldn   t dance, so the people didn   t  come. It was just people that wanted to buy. I don   t know, that cut the  parade down. It wasn   t as good as it used to be. They didn   t have as  good of advertising. It wasn   t advertised like it had been. Things just  start changing. People start dropping out. You might say some of the  ones that could make a good show somewhere else. They wouldn   t  come back to Red Earth, but all us locals were always there.  Little Thunder How about just in general on the Native art scene, what were some of  the changes from the    70s through the    80s? Because you were already  selling in the    70s and traveling quite a bit.  Mameah Seventies to the    80s? Shoot, that was some of the good years.  Little Thunder There probably weren   t a lot people doing your work.  16  Mameah Oh, you mean my type of work? Well, there was Bruce  Caesar . I think  we were the only two that did German silver. The rest were all sterling  and turquoise. It was just loaded with people from Arizona and New  Mexico. They had all that turquoise and all that stuff.  Little Thunder They were coming out this way and hitting a lot of the shows.  Mameah More and more.  Little Thunder Right. How about changes in the Native art scene from the    80s to the     90s? Just the whole art scene in general?  Mameah It was basically like the others, except it did start falling off. I don   t  know. There was so many good years, I can   t place the actual dates. As  far as I was concerned, they were good years, but there was   you could  tell a difference in the people. There wasn   t as big of crowds as there  used to be. Like I said, the dance part kept falling off.  Little Thunder And that was a lot of your audience.  Mameah Yeah.  Little Thunder Some of your audience there.  Mameah But we didn   t suffer for it because we sold just as much. It was funny  because this woman came by and she looked at everything, and she  said,    Is this sterling?       No, it   s German silver or nickel-silver.       Oh.     So she put it down and wandered off. Then before the show was over  she came back and she bought three, four articles. She said,    They   re  selling them like this over there, they   re not as good,    she said,    but  they want a big price for them.    I said,    Well, that   s sterling, you pay  more.    She said,    I don   t care, yours is better looking,    she said.    I   ll  buy this. It   s cheaper.    So we sold.  Little Thunder (Laughs) You helped start a Pawnee Artists Association?  Mameah Yeah, we had so many Pawnee artists, that there was a banker and  Brummett Echohawk, who was an outstanding artist and Cecil Stern,  he   s Pawnee, business man, and Everett Berry was a banker. They were  all friends. They   re the ones that were backing it. They got it started. It  was one of them   s idea and they just run with it. They had a meeting  and invited everybody to go out, to come out. We went out to it, a lot  of us went to it. That   s how it started. Then we   d have meetings out at  the Roundhouse and several times the Roundhouse was closed, so we   d  have the meetings outside the Roundhouse. But then we formed and  17  people started joining. The purpose of the Pawnee Arts was to get all  artists and we were going to teach the younger ones. We weren   t getting  paid for it or anything. We all had certain things we were going to  teach. Brummett came in and he taught charcoal and he was going to  teach acting, give acting lessons. I don   t think anybody got into oils.  Then I was down for jewelry making and yarn work. Somebody else  made ribbon work, shawls, just different things that they made that they  could teach the younger ones or anyone that wanted to learn. That   s  how the Pawnee Arts formed. We did really good, it   s surprising, but  we had good backers.  Little Thunder So you had several workshops. Did you do a metal workshop? Did you  do a workshop in jewelry making? Did you give one through the  Pawnee Artists Association? Did you do the workshop in jewelry that  you had talked about?  Mameah Oh yeah.  Little Thunder Was that your first workshop that you   d ever done?  Mameah Yeah.  Little Thunder How did it go?  Mameah It went good. What did you learn? You learned moccasin making,  wasn   t it?  Donna Yeah, we did some moccasin making and ribbon work. I think Buddy  Lone Chief, didn   t he teach something, too? Drawing?  Mameah Yeah, he did sketching.  Donna Drawing, you know Buddy   Charles?  Little Thunder Yes.  Donna I knew you did if you were from Tulsa. Oh, this is Donna. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Did you have a mixture of adults and younger people in your class?  Mameah Yes, anybody. Anyone that wanted to learn.  Little Thunder That   s wonderful.  Mameah We had a program from   art association of Oklahoma City   what was  the name of that?  18  Donna Oklahoma Arts Council?  Mameah Yeah, and they had this grant and we applied for it and it went through.  It concerned a master artist and they would teach one person. So I was a  master artist and we had Willy Beard was the one that I was to teach. I  mean he picked it up in nothing flat. He was really good. It didn   t take  long, but he was like that. He was really gifted, but he was an alcoholic,  so you couldn   t depend on him. But all during the time that he was  doing this, he was steady because he was interested in it.  Little Thunder I remember that grant.  Mameah He did, he did everything that he was supposed to do. When it was over,  he could do real good work. He had a talent. We did that, but that was  the only time   the Pawnee Arts just kind of   after that, I quit. I was the  president for about three terms   he was president then last time, then  he just got off and didn   t come back. So I had to take over because I  was vice. I stayed with it that year, but that was the last year. The next  year, I didn   t want to have that responsibility. Then the woman that got  in there, she was brainless as far as artwork, so I quit the organization  because of her.  Little Thunder Is it still around today?  Mameah No.  Little Thunder Okay.  Mameah It lasted about two or three years later and then it just faded away.  Little Thunder Right. Now you have taught   is it finger-weaving? Is that what you  taught most recently? Or weaving a couple years ago?  Mameah No, I taught that with a class     Little Thunder That was at the Pawnee Artists     Mameah    with the Pawnee Arts and I   ve been trying to teach my nieces, but  they haven   t caught on yet.  Donna We   ve got to try again here. Mine was way too loose. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Let   s talk about your technique just a little bit more. When you order  your German silver to work with, how does it come? What form does it  come in? Sheets?  19  Mameah You can order up to thirty-six inches by twelve, I just have them cut it  into twelve by twelves. I can handle it better.  Little Thunder They   re sheets of twelve by twelve?  Mameah Unless it was armbands and I would specify the length and the width.  They would cut it that way I didn   t have to saw it.  Little Thunder Can you take us through the process? Of, let   s say making an armband.  Mameah Like I just said, I had the iron bands cut because I didn   t want to use a  saw.  Little Thunder Oh, you had the width and the length cut already. Okay.  Mameah Because it   s kind of hard to saw.  Little Thunder So take us through some earrings, maybe. Making a pair of earrings,  just talking us through how you would make a pair of earrings.  Mameah First, draw your pattern and transfer it onto the metal. I used to scratch  it in because with a carving or anything else it would smear and you   d  lose your pattern. After I transferred the pattern, I would scratch it on,  then saw it with a jeweler   s saw, and cut it out. Then you file it, the  rough edges, get it straight, bevel it, and then you would stamp it. After  you stamped it, if you want it curved, you would curve it. You   d put it  on a round piece of metal and pound it to where it would curve.  Otherwise, you could lay it flat like an earring. Oh, you would hammer  it. Now I used to hammer the back of mine, a lot of them didn   t, but I  would hammer mine because when I stamped, I stamped deep. It wasn   t  just on the surface. I was heavy-handed, I guess. Then I would turn it  over and hammer it on the back. A lot of them didn   t like that because  they said it marred the surface. After you buff it, it takes any marks out  or anything, it takes the scratches out. Then you buff it and that   s it.  Little Thunder Did you ever use stones in combination? What did you like in terms of  stone?  Mameah It would be black onyx. I worked mostly in black onyx.  Little Thunder Yeah, that looks good with the   we   ll look at a piece here. (Laughter)  Mameah Or red   what is it? Carmelite?  Carnelian?  I forgot the name of the  stones now, it   s been so long. But it   d would be a red stone, it wouldn   t  20  be onyx. I mean it wouldn   t be   now I forgot the name of that. What   s  that, the red one?  Donna Oh, coral?  Mameah It wouldn   t be coral, it would be more of a stone, not from the  Southwest.  Little Thunder What is your creative process from the time you get an idea for a piece  of jewelry?  Mameah How long would it take?  Little Thunder How does it work? Do you get an idea and then draw it in a notebook?  What is your creative process?  Mameah Yeah, I would draw it in a notebook. I   ve got notebooks around here  with all patterns drawn out. I would be drawing up here late at night, if I  was watching TV and then I   d go back there and transfer it, get it all  straightened out the way I wanted it. Then I would work on it. So it was  always just hit and miss.  Little Thunder Did you like to work better at night?  Mameah Yes, I would work until like two or three o   clock in the morning. My  husband would let me sleep in and he   d buff in the mornings. I  wouldn   t even hear him. I   d be sound asleep. He   d take whatever I   d  made and he   d buff it, finish it all up so that all it needed was to be  carded. We worked good together like that and we were always ready  for another show. We went to one   we had to go once a month because  we   d sell out and then we   d have to restock. It would take us the rest of  the month to do that until the next show.  Little Thunder How many pieces would you try to have, typically?  Mameah Gosh, I don   t know. Like about six sets of those long earrings     Little Thunder Wow.  Mameah    and six hands and broaches   about three pair of them. Couple of  armbands, roach spreaders. Just a variety of everything, but the earrings  is what we do the most of and we painted a lot of circles like she   s got.  Do you have the circles on?  Donna Yeah.  21  Little Thunder Oh great.  Mameah They were different sizes, and they were long. She had some of the  longer ones there.  Donna Oh the   I showed her these. These? Or the other ones?  Mameah Circles.  Donna They   re in my bag.  Little Thunder We   ll look at those in a minute, we   ll pause.  Mameah I sold a lot of those. They were more inexpensive than the Water Birds.  Those were more expensive because they were harder to make. There  were more pieces to them.  Little Thunder In terms of designs, did you sometimes do specifically Pawnee designs?  I know you sometimes     Mameah All the designs were Pawnee designs because I made them. They were  my creation. They weren   t traditional because I don   t know of any  specific designs or patterns that they had. I   ve seen earrings that were  made by men, but they were pretty plain and they were small, about two  pieces. Some had fringes on them, and that   s the one thing I couldn   t  do, was fringes. I couldn   t cut them that small. So I had to give up  fringes. Took too long. All the patterns I made were just a lot of birds,  and circles, and sometimes the moon with a water bird. I did a lot of  peyote work. Sunbursts, I did a lot of those. And the large sunbursts  with the water bird hanging. Just different ways of doing things.  Little Thunder Combining different   yeah.  Mameah Yeah, anything that come to mind and it always ended up good. It  always turned out good. To me, when I think about something,    I  wonder how this would be?    I   d have pieces laying back there and I   d  just start fooling around with them and I   d make a pattern. Something  would come up. A lot of times that was how I got my patterns.  Little Thunder Looking back over your career, what was kind of a fork-in-the-road  moment when you decided to go this one way as opposed to   for  example, keeping on painting or     Mameah Like when I was doing and decided to do something else?  Little Thunder Yeah, when you really took this path.  22  Mameah It was when I was working for Kugee. I worked for Kugee for four  years and I wasn   t getting any credit. I wanted to have my own stamp  on the back, I wanted RI on there  Riding in . I asked him why not and  he said,    Well, Supernaw   s on there.    I said,    That   s not what I want. I  want RI, my stamp.       We can   t do that.    They left it Supernaw, they  wouldn   t change it. I really didn   t like that. So there was a rift starting  and he was getting tired of my work, I guess. And vice versa. Anyway,  that   s when I met Ace. We were going to get married, and I was ready  to quit. One day he came in there and he just told me he was going to  terminate me. I was      Okay.    Because we weren   t working too good  together. But I noticed when I went in that day   I knew this was  coming. When I went in that day I had   I used to keep all my patterns.  He had a copier, a big copier. Whenever I made them, I   d go in there  and I   d go in there and copy it, so I   d have different patterns and I could  draw from that if I wanted to make something like it I could look at that  and do it. That   s the reason why I copied those. The night before, I  don   t know why I did it, but I took all my good patterns, I took them  home with me and I don   t know why. That next morning was when he  said I was terminated. He had to let me go, things weren   t working  out   He had a store in Tulsa, and he had one in Skiatook, and one in  Anadarko, and he had to close one. So he was going to close the one in  Tulsa. Anyway, I noticed that morning all my patterns were gone. All  the folders were gone. I knew right then, something   s going to happen  today, so he told me that, which is okay because I wanted to quit  anyway. We ended good, friends, former nephew-in-law.  Little Thunder But that   s when you launched into your own work full-time.  Mameah Yeah, that   s when Ace and I got married. I had been working at home  doing little things, but that   s what got him mad because he found out I  was working. He thought I was doing it during his hours and I was  doing it at home. I had my own tools because I bought them from him  at the store. I bought what little tools that I needed, which wasn   t very  much. I was just making earrings and I was making those hair ties.  Anyway, I got married, so that   s the way it started, making the jewelry.  Little Thunder What would you say has been one of the high points in your career?  Mameah The high points? I guess when I won out to Philbrook was one of them.  That painting there, it went on tour. You know I was I telling you? Then  it took Grand Prize and what was the other   First Place and Grand  Prize at Anadarko one year. Somewhere else it took an award, and I  can   t remember where. So it   s been around.  Little Thunder What   s been one of the low points of your career?  23  Mameah It was when my husband died, when Ace died because I just quit  everything then. I didn   t want to do anything. I can   t remember high  points.  Donna The  Red Earth  Honored One. How about Southern Plains when they  featured you? You weren   t feeling     Mameah At first, when they were going to show my work, yeah, but when it  came time, it just wasn   t there.  Little Thunder Is there anything else you would like to talk about before we look at  some of your work?  Mameah No, I can   t      Little Thunder You made a lot of good friends on the circuit, I think. You   ve probably  made a lot of friends, artist friends, on the circuit.  Mameah Oh yes, oh and we traveled all over and we met a lot of people. Ace  made a slew of friends. (Laughter) Yeah, I really enjoyed that, going  around. Then, I don   t know, it   s kind of sad in a way because every year  you   d go back somebody would be gone. They had died during the  year. You missed them. I really don   t know how many is left because  I   m eighty-two now, so I don   t know how many is lasted.  Little Thunder I know you   re hoping to get back in your studio soon.  Mameah I hope so, soon as I can get back there. We have a great plan   I mean,  Donna has great plans. (Laughter).  Donna I do. I want to go to Cherokee Arts Festival.  Little Thunder Do the Cherokee Art Festival again.  Donna Yeah, for another one.  Little Thunder All right, we   re going to pause a minute and look at some of your work.  Okay, so we   re looking at your painting, The Doctor Dance, that you  won Grand Award on at Anadarko Indian Fair. Is there anything else  you   d like to tell us about it?  Mameah It   s a     Little Thunder It   s beautiful and complex.  24  Mameah It   s an old Pawnee ritual, ceremony, called The Doctor Dance. They  had different dancers, different doctors, and they took their medicine  from animals, so they would dance like this animal, whichever one that  they were doctors of. Then the animals helped them. The ones in the  painting are the white horse and the black horse. The ones in the  background are the ones that   s going to perform. They   ll sing their  songs and the one in the middle is the blanket, that   s the altar part. The  people, they sit in the back. The women sit in the back, the men sit in  the front. That   s just kind of a childish version of what a mud lodge  would look like to sit inside. Because actually they   re bigger than that,  this is just kind of a half. You have the fireplace in the center.  Little Thunder Really neat.  Mameah It   s really fascinating how they   re constructed. Because this goes back,  mud lodges, back years and years. They had to make this all themselves  and how they figured it all out and what they did, but they made them. I  guess you can see now where they   re washed away through the years.  There was two down here, going to Cushing, on the side of the road.  Dad used to show me, and you could see the ground. He   d say those  were mud lodges. There was two of them. Now, it   s washed away more  and you can   t hardly see them now.  Little Thunder Okay, go on. Marlene, you want to tell us more about this painting?  25  Mameah It was painted for the cover of a Quapaw powwow book. I forgot which  year. It   s just a two-step. It   s a flat, two-dimensional, or that   s the  traditional Indian artwork, which they don   t do anymore.   A granddaughter joins the group.   Little Thunder Okay, and these were the hair ties you were telling us about, initially  inspired when you were asked to repair some beaded hair ties. They   re  just beautiful. You can tell they just hang beautifully, must hang  26  beautifully. And these belong to your niece, Donna? I   m getting the  pattern.  Mameah Does  your mom  have a pair and Emma?  Donna Yes.  Little Thunder That almost looks a little floral.  Mameah See what you missed out on by not dancing?  Granddaughter I sure did, I didn   t let my hair grow. I could have pretended, though.  Little Thunder So now we   re looking at one of Marlene   s necklaces. Water bird design,  beautiful. Stone in there. Any special memories associated with this,  Donna?  Donna I think this is one of the Christmas presents I got to pick out.  Little Thunder Wow.  Donna Is that where that one was?  Mameah Probably.  Donna If I was good during the year, I   d get to pick out a gift and I   d get to  pick out my own gift. She   d always ask me every year, she does ask me  what I want for Christmas, and usually it   s some of her work. I   ve been  27  trying to save all of it. I don   t have all of it, but I   d like to have at least  one of everything she makes. That   s why she   s got to get back in there.  Mameah You got most of it.  Donna I got most   yeah.  Mameah One of each.  Little Thunder Almost one of each. That   s beautiful.  Mameah But she doesn   t have her daughter   s half.  Donna Yeah, which is a sore spot. (Laughter)  Mameah I just said I use this pattern quite a bit, the Water Bird. When I got to  draw a design, I can draw the design and put it on top of the other one  and it   s exactly the same. Not only the Water Bird, but different  patterns that I   ve done for so long all these years. They   re just  automatic.  Little Thunder Your hands remember, exactly.  Mameah Friend of mine wanted a pair of earrings, hand earrings for his wife. So  he ordered them and I told him I   ve never made hand earrings. I thought  it was kind of funny. He said,    No, just make them.       Okay.    I said,     You want them up or down?    He said,    Up.    I made him little  earrings, sent them to him, and then someone had seen them while I was  making them and they wanted a pair. So I made another pair, and it just  caught on.  Little Thunder Just caught on, yeah.  Mameah Then I started making the bigger hands, and then that really caught on.  A lot of the Osages wanted those. The women wear three hands and  some of them wanted work with the three hands.  Donna Do you want to try that, something like that?  Little Thunder Yes, that looks wonderful. We   re going to take a look at these visually.  Here we   re looking at the hand designs. I love the texturing pattern  work, too.  28  Donna The black ones, that   s pretty.  Little Thunder Two more different earrings.  Little Thunder We   re looking at another one of your hands, but it   s not in German  silver.  29  Mameah It   s in brass. I forgot to mention I worked in brass, too. It   s a little  harder to work with. It doesn   t cut as well as the German silver, but all  in all it works up about the same.  Little Thunder And it   s a neat look, yeah. Thank you very much for your time today.  Mameah You   re welcome.  -------  -------
