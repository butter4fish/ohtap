 Wilson  All right, today is February 10, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and  I   m with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma  State University Library. Today I   m in Stillwater, Oklahoma, at the  Stillwater Public Library where I will be interviewing Karl Oltmanns for  the Stillwater History Series of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History  Project. Thank you for joining me today.  It   s great to be here.  To start out with, would you mind telling me when and where you were  born?  I was born in Cherokee Township, county of Payne, in Stillwater,  Oklahoma, which is now under Lake Blackwell. Part of the farm is, and  part of it is not. It was on the Coyle Road. If you go to Coyle Road and  turn north, there   s a gate, a green gate. If you walk down through there,  you   ll find the foundation of the house. I was born at the farm there. My  great-uncle was one of the early doctors here, and he delivered me.  How neat   That   s how come he put all these things where I was born at. The birth  certificate said that. I didn   t know until I declared for top secret in the  Army, so it was kind of interesting to find out I knew something that I  didn   t know, really. (Laughs)  Yes  And what   s your birth date?  Eleventh of October, 1929.  Were you the first child?  5  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Number three.  Okay. Were there many more after you?  Two more. We had a big family.  How long had your parents been on that property?  They moved there in 1928. They moved from a little town near Hobart,  which is Gotebo, Oklahoma. I think the reason for moving, they had a  terrible drought. Dad had one bale of cotton on eighty acres that year. He  decided,    This is it,    so he left, and he moved up here.  How did they get to the Gotebo area?  My grandfather came from Germany. It was northern Germany, real flat,  and they moved to Iowa, and it was hill country. He took out, I guess,  like Marco Polo, just decided to go on an expedition, and he found the  land that he thought was great. It had green grass, everything he wanted,  flat, just right, but he didn   t know it didn   t rain but very seldom. He saw  it when the grass was green. So he packed up the family, and they  moved down to Gotebo, actually to the little town just out of town there.  It was a very nice little town, or was at that time.  I wonder how he knew about that town.  I just don   t know. I think about that many times. How did they go out  and be gone two or three weeks? The wife knew nothing. He was going  out to look for land. That was it. (Laughter) That   s what he found.  That   s quite a stretch from Iowa.  Yes it is.  Did he speak German when he came here?  Yes, he spoke German. I can speak some. I got along very well with  German until I got to Germany. (Laughter) I was buying this watch I  have here. It   s an Omega, and I could save some money on it. The lady  says,    Why don   t we speak English. We can understand each other  better.    (Laughter) That   s the kind of German I talk. It was kind of  mixed. I mixed it up a little bit. When I started to school, I could speak  more German than English. World War II came along, and you   d figure  in the    30s we   re already having trouble with Hitler and the group, so  then they started checking us out, west of town, and we did away with  the German newspaper and all then.  6  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Do you know if there were many other German speakers around  Gotebo?  Yes, there were. There were a lot of Mennonite people down there that  could speak German. One of the reasons that my father took the  opportunity to leave there, my uncle lived up here. He   s married to my  father   s sister. She was from there, so she wanted to go home, and my  mother wanted to come up here. That was one of the reasons, too.  So how did your parents meet?  Through the university. My mother was up here. She was, I think about  1918, on the swim team at the university up here. All of my father   s  sisters went through school here. Then, belonging to the Lutheran  church, you just meet. My mother met my father, and my father   s sister  met my mother   s brother. They had a double marriage, got married the  same day, (Laughs) so I have double relatives here. That   s how they  met, through the school here, really.  So they were married in Stillwater?  They were married here, yes.  At the Salem Lutheran?  Salem, at that time, I don   t know whether it was in town. It may have  not been. Yes, it was in town. It was already here, yes. You know where  the jail annex is? That   s where the old church originally was. That was  where I was baptized and confirmed, in that church.  Where was your mother from originally?  Here, right here.  Oh, she was born and raised in Stillwater?  Yes, oh, yes. She taught school at a little old school out west of town  where I started school. It was district thirteen, and I think it was Elm  Grove, but we called it Hard Scrabble because there were two district  thirteens in Payne County. That was a tough one. We went to school  with a lot of different students. A lot of the parents of those students  were moonshiners. There were three families that didn   t dabble in that.  My parents were one of them.  Did your family consume any alcohol?  7  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Grandfather made wine all the time, but you didn   t touch his. It was  back in the closet, the double closet in a little house. The one I can  remember, it was on Western Street. They had a little farm down there.  There was a closet that one door went this way, and then you went over  and zigzagged that way. Well, he kept the wine in there, so we stayed  out of that. The whole family did. (Laughs)  How did your mother   s parents get to the Stillwater area?  My mother   s parents came over here by way of the, actually, it was the  US government. They were looking for farmers, and at that time, the  communists were working to take over Russia. They took the Bibles  away from them. That was the first thing. They had a chance to come  over here, their way paid. There were a whole group of them came over.  My grandfather ended up in Kansas for a few years, worked on the  railroad. Then his sister made the land run, and she got this farm out  here. His sister didn   t want it, so that   s how he got the land out west of  town. That was known as the Marena neighborhood, is what it was,  really. You   ve heard of Marena? It   s on the weather map.  (Laughs) Really?  Yes. If you go out here to Hackelman Road and go about three miles  south, there used to be the little town of Marena there. That   s where they  got all their mail and everything, out of Marena, at that time. When I  was growing up, we got it at Route Three. If you could go straight west  on  Highway  51 where it curves, goes back south, if you go straight  through there, that went through the lake. You went around, and the  schoolhouse where I went to school was right in the middle of where  Hackelman Road and Nineteenth Street intersect. That   s where I went to  school at. It was very interesting.  Wow. Well, did you hear any stories about their journey over?  They would not talk much about that. I have a second cousin, Mother   s  first cousin, would   ve been great to interview. He   s passed on since, but  he came over here at eighteen years of age. He knew all about what  happened in Russia. Now, I did hear from him. His brother went back to  Russia by way of the US government to show them how to set up hog  farms, the communist government. He got to the border. He had a  camera and a pocket knife. They took that away from him and kept it.  He was there a year, and he reported back. He had some pictures he did  get back. The old church over there had been filled up with hay. They  weren   t using it anymore. If you want to see the old church that was out  here that my grandfather built west of town where the cemetery is, that   s  8  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  almost a replica of it. It   s at the Salem Lutheran Church. I have a picture  of it, and one of the old pews is there. We still maintain the cemetery.  It   s a beautiful place.  Do you know what year they came over?  It was in 1889 or somewhere in there. I don   t know exactly, but, you  know, they wouldn   t talk much about over there. Marlene   s dad  wouldn   t talk about it at all. That   s my wife that is deceased. All he said  one day, he said,    I   m an American citizen.    That was zapped. That was  it. You couldn   t get any more out of him.  Do you know what port they came through?  Grandmother and Grandfather came through Baltimore. Marlene   s  parents came through Ellis Island. They came over later, and the reason  they came to Baltimore is they were well-screened to start with, and then  they had to have a sponsor here. I think one of the Bieberdorfs, which is  a prominent name in the history of the church, was living here at the  time. Mother was a Bieberdorf, so that   s how you track that down.  (Laughter) But they had to have a sponsor. I know Marlene   s dad missed  a train or went through Morrison and ended up in Pawnee because he  didn   t know English from German or Russian and he went there. They  picked him up over there. Marlene   s mother was here a little earlier, and  they lived out west of Stillwater. My mother and her mother went to  church school together. (Laughter) It   s a funny deal, that.  Well, was the draw to Stillwater just the fact that there were other  people already here?  There were some here. That   s what I say   I think their name was  Bieberdorf, was already here.  I wonder what brought them to this location.  The same things: offered land. Oklahoma, if you think, was just being  settled. They were looking for people that knew how to raise wheat, and  they brought a lot of that red wheat seed with them to start it out, hard  wheat, hard winter wheat. That was one of the things. They wanted  farmers that knew how to raise wheat. That was the reason they came  over there. One of the reasons that part of them ended up in the Ukraine  is it had to be drained, and there were some engineers in the family.  They knew how to drain that land. It   s interesting. I wish I would   ve  asked Grandmother and Grandfather more questions. When World War  II started and we sided with Russia, Grandmother cried like a baby. She  said,    That   s bad. You don   t side with them.     9  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Yes.  She saw her sister laying at the train depot, when part of them went to  Siberia. They killed her.  Really?  They got out of there fast. Grandmother and Grandfather traded my  mother   s oldest brother. Gave him to a Jewish family when they left  Russia. They met late at night and got the baby back across the border.  They thought she   d come back because they caught them escaping.  So they sent the baby with the Jewish family.  They gave my uncle Rudolf to a Jewish family, and there was an  agreement, signed agreement, somewhere.    We   ll get the baby back to  you,    and they did.  That was just because the situation was so precarious?  Oh, it was. It was bad. To hear them tell it, it was really bad. One of  Grandmother   s brothers came over here, and he thought he learned to  speak English, and he learned to speak French in Canada before he got  here. He got upset, and he went back. They sent him to Siberia, and he  died over there. They caught him and sent him back. That was it.  But while they were living in Russia, they all maintained their German  heritage?  Absolutely, yes. They maintained it. They built the church there and  everything. The little town of Annette, Russia, is what it was, which is  Ukraine today. It was interesting to go to Grandmother and  Grandfather   s and listen to some of their ways they did things and how  they could survive with practically nothing. My parents could do the  same thing. It was hard times. Actually, World War II was tough.  Oh, I bet. Do you remember any particular stories they would share  about their time in Russia or     No, not anything particularly. This first cousin of Mother   s shared about  as much as anything about how strict they were. I know they always  made the remark that the Bolsheviks stole their horses. They got robbed  several times in Russia. They were ready to get out of there. My great-uncle  Paul, who was one of the early doctors in Stillwater, the one that  delivered me when I was out west of town, he used the excuse   he was  10  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  in the Russian Army. He had to do some research for his wife   s health in  Germany, and he went AWOL. He came right straight to the States. He  settled in a little town out here, Loyal, Oklahoma. If you go out there,  there   s a Friedemann Street. He was a mayor, he was a doctor, and he  was postmaster of that town. Real interesting. Then he came up here to  practice medicine. The Presbyterian church, you know where it   s  located? It   s just across the street, on Fifth Street, there   s a little red  house. That   s where he practiced medicine. That was his office.  And what was his full name?  Paul Friedemann.  And he was your great-uncle.  My great-uncle.  Do you know how many generations back your family was when they  lived in Germany?  I can trace mine back. I   m an eighth cousin of Johann Sebastian Bach   s  wife. (Laughter) I know that. That   s quite a ways back. We traced it  back to Bach.  That is. How long was your family living in Russia after Germany?  I don   t know. Catherine the Great is the one that brought them over there  to Russia. She promised them that land if they   d farm it. She gave them  the land. Then, when the communists took over, that changed real fast  then. In fact, I have relatives live there yet. Their name is Bergstrasser,  their last name. Part of them used to live here in Stillwater.  Did you hear any stories from the sister that settled the land in  Stillwater?  No, I didn   t really know her. That was before my time. After my  grandparents came over, he moved his parents over. They lived with him  out west of town, built another house for them. They lived in that house.  I remember that house very plain because it was just a shell when I was  growing up there. Didn   t tear it down. It was made, actually, as a chick  house for raising little chicks. That   s what they used it for.  So after your parents married, they moved to Gotebo for a little while?  Yes, they moved immediately. My oldest brother and my sister were  born in Gotebo, so they lived there from 1921, it   d be, to 1928, I   d say.  11  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Okay. What years did your mother attend OSU, or Oklahoma A M?  Actually, what it was, it was a prep school she attended, kind of like  Northern Oklahoma  College  is today. What it was, she got her  teacher   s certificate. You had to take a test and all. She taught school  then. She taught school out at Hard Scrabble for a number of years out  there.  What high school did she graduate?  Actually didn   t. We didn   t even have a high   in 1937, when we moved  from there, they didn   t even have bus transportation. My brother came  into town and lived with my grandmother to start to high school here,  and then he finished at Glencoe.  So your brother helped start the high school in Stillwater?  No, no, he did his freshman year here. He started high school here.  Okay, okay.  Did his freshman year and then moved to Glencoe.  So how many years did your mother have to attend the prep school to  get her teaching certificate?  I think it was two years, a two-year course. It was OSU, but it was a prep  school, more or less. She blended in with the   she made the swim team.  (Laughs)  That   s pretty neat   I wish I could find a picture of that. It looked like she was wearing  bloomers sitting on a bench there with the swim team. (Laughter)  Do you know where the swimming pool was?  Yes, it   s where the School of Architecture is today. You know, they built  two sides of that building? The center part was where the swimming  pool was in there.  What year did you say she was on the swim team?  That was in 1918, I believe it was. My uncle went to school here, and he  ended up being a lawyer for Westinghouse. I still have the rocking chair  12  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  that he made while he was taking, I guess you   d call it kind of like vo-tech,  there at the university. They used to teach that, woodworking. He  was taking woodworking. I have the original rocking chair yet.  Did he go to OU for law school?  No, no, no. He went to Nebraska someplace to law school there. He was  a lawyer for Westinghouse. Then my other uncle was principal of where  this high school is right here for a number of years.  The Stillwater Public Library now?  Yes. My cousin was one of the teachers here.  What was your uncle the principal   s name?  G. C. Friedemann. Gus Friedemann taught   oh, what do they call that  where the students go out and go to certain   I had one that was kind of,  taught her bookkeeping. What do they call that?  Apprenticeship?  Yes, kind of an apprenticeship. They   d send them out, you know. After  their junior year, they   d go out and work in someplace. Like I had the  dealership here in town. They   d work at that.  Neat.  Then another one, my uncle Karl sold real estate here in Stillwater.  Karl Friedemann?  Yes, Karl Friedemann.  What were your parents    names?  George, and her name was Marie.  Her maiden name was Friedemann?  Her name was Friedemann, yes.  Were your grandparents in Gotebo farmers, as well?  Yes, they were.  13  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Primarily wheat?  Wheat and alfalfa and cattle. They raised a lot of cattle down there. He  had about a hundred head of Hereford cattle.  And your grandparents here were wheat farmers?  They farmed cotton, wheat, just whatever. That land would hardly draw.  It   d hardly raise mice, as sorry as some of that land was. They had 240  acres of it, this kind of red land. If you   ll go out to Lake Blackwell  where the cabins are today, the rock from those cabins came off the old  family farm.  Neat. Well, growing up, what was your home like, where you were born?  It was very close. As a family, we were real close. We ate together, we  slept in the same house together, and we all went to church together. We  were close knit.  Did your grandparents live     They lived on Western Street at that time.  So was that very far? That was a little ways.  No, Western is just a little ways out here.  But a few miles from where your home was?  Oh, yes, yes. When we would come to town, we would stop at Sixth and  Western, and they would let us out, and we   d walk down through a  muddy road over to grandparents    while they went to town and did their  shopping. Then we had to meet them at a certain time there that they  would come by and pick us up. Later on, when we grew a little older, we  got to go into town and meet them at Katz Department Store. That round  bench, that   s where we   d meet. (Laughter)  Did your family always have a car?  Yes, they did.  Do you remember what kind?  Yes. The first one I remember very plain was a 1928 Whippet. Then  they got a 1931 Whippet, and then a    33 Dodge,    37 Plymouth, and then  he ended up with a Studebaker. My father was having a lot of health  14  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  problems, and during that interim time I bought a pickup for him and  furnished it at the farm. I went to work at a Dodge dealership in 1948  here. Ended up and bought it.  What were some of your chores growing up out there?  Getting kindling in and chips of wood to make the fire in the morning,  milking the cows, feeding the chickens, feeding the hogs. We had our  chores. They were set out for us. If you didn   t have that kindling in and  my father got up and it wasn   t there, you got up, too. You lit the lantern,  and you went out and got kindling. (Laughter) That was it, so we made  sure we had kindling in.  I bet. What are some meals that your mother would prepare?  You know, we butchered our own hogs and our own beef so we would  have just the meals we have today, really. One of the things we thought  was really a good meal, she bought halibut fish. You could buy those  here in town, and we   d have those. We had a lot of rabbits. Killed a lot  of rabbits.  Where in town would you buy the halibut fish?  At Cooksey   s.  Cooksey   s?  Cooksey   s Grocery.  On the corner of Main and Ninth?  Main and Ninth, that   s it.  What else would you buy at the grocery store?  Twenty-five pounds of flour. We had to have a lot of flour. She bought  just staples, no canned food. Mother would count   every year, she  always figured out how many quarts of beans she had to can, how many  quarts of tomato juice. We had tomato juice. She   d can a hundred,  hundred-fifty quarts of that. How many peas   we didn   t have good luck  with peas. They   ll spoil if you don   t have a pressure cooker. We didn   t  have that. They used what they called a hot water steaming type seal.  Meat, there was nothing left but the squeal of a hog. I mean, the brains,  everything. When we butchered, you did everything. We took the  casings, the entrails of the hog, cleaned and scraped, cleaned and  scraped. That   s where you put the sausage in. Ground it up with a hand  15  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  grinder and ground all that. The bacon we cured out in the smokehouse.  The hams we would cure. Beef, when we a butchered beef, you had to  can every bit of it because you didn   t have a refrigerator. We canned all  of that, so we didn   t butcher many cattle or calves, mainly hogs.  Would you eat chicken very often?  Oh, we   d eat a lot of chicken. (Laughs) When they   d get quail-size,  you   d already start butchering them. Daddy always got the breast. I got  the back of the back. My brother got the front of the back. My sister got  a thigh and a leg, and my brother got a thigh and a leg. Mother, she   d get  the gizzard and the liver, probably. That   s how we divided it. (Laughs)  Then when the preacher would come over, we had a little FHB on food,     Family, hold back    because the preacher is being well-fed. (Laughter)  Was there ever dessert?  Oh, the main good dessert, she canned a lot of peaches and pears. We  had a big peach orchard and pears. She canned those, and we had those  for dessert. Another thing we raised were sweet potatoes. We could store  those. You can bury those in straw and keep them through the winter, so  we buried those.  Outside?  Outside, yes. Just dig a big pit and line it with straw and put the sweet  potatoes in. You dig in there and get your sweet potatoes out of there.  Turnips, we ate a lot of turnips. Mother canned turnips. Oh, beets. Beets  is one thing we canned, too.  Did you have a cellar?  Yes, we had a cellar. Actually, we had a basement on the farm out there.  We never did have a cellar. We always had a basement. That   s where we  kept our stuff.  Did you have a cream separator?  Yes, it was down in the basement.  Did you sell your cream in town?  Sold the cream in town. Cream and egg money bought the staples, is  what it would do. My brother used to take that sweet cream and he   d     Mother always baked bread. He   d hold that bread like that on top, and  he   d get every corner and then soak it and put sugar on it. (Laughter)  16  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Oh, my goodness. (Laughter)  He still does that today. He   s eighty-nine years old, and he still holds  food that way. (Laughs) He graduated from OSU in engineering,  industrial engineering.  Okay. Does he still live around here?  Yes, he lives in Oklahoma City.  Well, how often would you come into town?  We tried to make it once a week, and it was a day deal because if you  went downtown at that time, anyone went down there. You   d meet all  your old buddies, farmers, you know. Mother would meet all of her  friends. They   d visit. Cooksey Corner was a popular place. I   ll never  forget watching that. We never did do it as a family, but you   d see  people   they would have the apples out there on display in bushel  baskets. They   d be eating apples out there while he was trying to sell  that stuff. (Laughs) We took the cream and eggs, usually, to Cooksey   s.  They graded the cream by the butterfat. They had a spinner that would  spin that, and they could tell how much butterfat was in it.  We liked Jerseys and no Holsteins. They didn   t have much cream.  Jerseys were the main cattle that produced a lot of cream. Then our  Malta cow is a roan cow we raised. They were real nice. They would  produce good cream, too. The cream, there were three different kinds of  separators. DeLaval made one that the cream came out on the bottom. I  don   t know why. No, on the top. It came out on the top. The Iowa  Separator we had, it came out on the bottom. Then they had one that had  a side glass, and you just drained it down. Another thing we did with  that cream, take the whey from that and make cheese out of it, good  cottage cheese. That was one of the treats we always had, too. Mother  would make big pancakes and then make a cheese roll out of it, sweeten  it up. That was one of our little good desserts. But, see, you couldn   t  store any of that, so you had to make it right there, and you   d eat it that  day. She baked some good cakes. That was all done on woodstove.  A wood-burning stove?  A wood-burning stove, you bet. We had a wood-burning stove, and it  had a water reservoir on one end, and we took our baths in the kitchen. I  mean, you had the hot water, you had everything there, so we   d take a  bath in the kitchen.  17  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Was that once a week?  Yes, once a week is about right. (Laughter) I was usually number three  in the tub, so you figure how the water got at the last. (Laughs) But we  believed in good sanitation. Didn   t have any plumbing. Had to haul all  the water in. I want to take my granddaughter. She wants to go out there.  The cistern is still there. Show her where I was born at.  That   s neat. And you had an outhouse?  Yes. Well, we got modern at the last. We had a three-holer, not just a  two-holer. First was one, then two, and then it got up to three. (Laughter)  We built a house at Glencoe without any electrical tools. My two  brothers and my father and myself built that house.  When was that?  In 1938 we built a new house out there. We finished it in    38. Started in     37. We hauled all the dirt out, with a  3.95 wheelbarrow, from that  basement.  Well, why did they build the new house?  Oh, the old one, you could look through it in the wintertime and see the  north wind coming in. It was that bad. It was terrible. We built that  house right beside the old house, so when we had to move, we didn   t go  any further from here to the wall to move our stuff over. That   s how  close we built it. That old house   you know how come we had to move.  Did I ever tell you why we moved from out there? The Resettlement  Administration built Lake Blackwell, and they bought all this land  around it. Our farm was the last one on the west side that was included  in that. We located that farm in Glencoe, and they bought the farm for  us. That   s all we really got out of that. They promised us that we   d have  use of that lake for life, to fish in and all that. Now look what   s  happened to it. The university has it. You can   t even get in there.  (Laughs)  Do you know Carl Blackwell and why the lake was named after him?  He was up here at the university. He was the one that spearheaded that  thing. I know that. He shoved it real hard. I always say he built it for one  purpose: that was to move the moonshiners out, to drown them out and  get rid of them. But they took good land to do it. They took all that  Stillwater Creek bottom. I have the farms below it, below the dam. It  was some of the best land there is. They took it, though.  18  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  And they used the rock, you said, that was on that property?  Yes, there was rock. You dig out about two feet down, and there were  two ledges of rocks. They didn   t need much trimming to make those  cabins with. They had those rock trimmers, and they   d trim them up.  They hauled those out in 1935 Ford trucks. I remember that very well.  My brother and I, I think we got maybe a nickel a week to open and  close the gates for the two trucks that hauled the rock out of there.  So what year was it that everyone had to move?  We had to be out of there by 1937. We moved in    37, moved to Glencoe.  I was born out there. My brother was born out there, and then my  youngest sister was born at Glencoe. She   s still living. She lives down in  Texas. She graduated from OSU up here.  What was her degree?  I think it was education. She never used it. She married an officer in the  Air Force. She never used her degree.  So since you moved to Glencoe, did you go to school in Glencoe?  Yes, I went to school there. I left there the third grade. I finished third  grade out here west of town. Then moved there, and that school had the  high school and grade schools all in one building. The grade schools are  downstairs, and the high school was upstairs. They just tore down that  building two years ago.  In Glencoe?  Yes. One of the reasons they picked that town over the 101 Ranch,  which they had a chance for some good land up there, for one reason,  the grandparents lived here and Mother didn   t want to leave. Secondly,  we had a full school up there, where we didn   t have any bus service out  here. Coyle would come within two miles. Stillwater didn   t run a bus out  there in that area. We could have bought land south of there, but who  wants it? That was one of the reasons. We were three quarters of a mile  from school and we could walk to school. That made it real handy.  Was Glencoe a thriving town?  It was a thriving town at the time, yes. It had two hardware stores, two  grocery stores, and had a real good bank. It was a thriving town. I drove  a school bus there when I was in high school, too.  19  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Really?  And was a janitor.  While you were in high school?  Yes. World War II was here, and they couldn   t get any help, so I did  that. Made a little money.  Well, you were a child during the 1930s, but did you realize there was a  Depression?  Oh, absolutely, absolutely. It was dry. In 1935, when the big dust storm  hit that Sunday, I remember Dad   my brother and I were getting  tadpoles out of a little waterhole, and he hollered,    Get in the house  Get  in the house     The horses had already came in. They put them up. That  big black cloud came in. I remember that so plain. We lit the lamps, it  was that dark. We used kerosene lamps, and they had to light those.  How long did it last?  The dust storms went actually from    35 to    38,    39. When we were out  there, Mother ripped up old clothes and stuff, put them in the window  sills to collect the dust and keep it from coming in. I remember that dust  storm very well.  How long do you think it was dark on that Sunday?  It stayed pretty dark for a long time. I remember that. You could see it  coming in. We weren   t actually in the dust area, but it just rolled in from  the western part of the state. If you go to Cushing today on  Highway   18, and before you get to the river you see those mounds? That was all  bare. That   s what the dust storms of the    30s blew. They made mounds.  You get out west of Hennessey, where the golf course is there, all those  mounds were from the dust storm. You get over the river and all of those  were. That didn   t start grassing over until a number of years later. We  would go to Gotebo, and we   d go out west, and they   d have to clear the  road. You couldn   t get through. It was covered up with sand. It was that  bad.  Could you see to drive, generally?  Oh, yes, didn   t have any trouble there. It just made mounds of dust and  dirt, just keep blowing up. When we bought that farm at Glencoe, when  my parents bought it, it was just washed all to pieces because they  farmed it and never did any conservation. It was rutted up. The topsoil  20  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  was gone. There was nothing left.  Were your parents still farming at that point?  Yes. I operated an F-20 tractor when I was eleven years old. That tooth  isn   t mine. I hooked it on the steering wheel when I was scalding a hog  and broke the tooth out. I didn   t have it put in until about four or five  years ago. I had a gold tooth, and, oh, that looked terrible. Took it out,  and they put the tooth in there.  So was the F-20 the first tractor you remember?  That was the first tractor we had, yes. Now, my father left his big  tractors when he left from Gotebo. He had two big Wallace tractors. One  of them would pull six plows, and the other one eight plows. They were  monsters. You couldn   t move them, at that time. My uncle made stock  tanks out of the back wheels. That   s kind of interesting.  Well, did you know that your family   did you have less money during  the 1930s?  We were fortunate, in a way. In a way, we weren   t. You   ve probably  heard of the WPA  Works Progress Administration , public works. Most  of those people out there were on public works. We didn   t qualify. There  was three families did not because we were making enough money. My  father was also an engineer for the Soil Conservation Service, so he had  part-time work there. Then, when they built Blackwell, he was the head  timekeeper on that, so he had a job.  All those kids got clothes furnished. They got nice corduroy clothes. We  didn   t have that. We wore overalls. For dinner, the teacher was the cook.  Little two-burner kerosene stove, and they usually had beans and  cornbread. They had cocoa. We could not partake of the beans and  cornbread. We weren   t supposed to have the cocoa. We were supposed  to have our own stuff, but she would bring us out the coal bin and bring  us drinks there while the three families would eat. Fried eggs, which an  egg wouldn   t spoil, you know. Put it in a Karo  Syrup  can, punch holes  in it. That was the way we packed lunch. We went to school with that.  So when you were going to school, all the other kids    parents were  working for the WPA?  Most of them were. Most of them were out there working.  Their lunches were paid for because of that.  21  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  They were paid for, that   s right. They furnished them lunches. You talk  about inequities    (Laughter)  Do you know what some of the WPA projects in the area were that they  were working on?  Lake Blackwell was built totally by WPA, public works project, under  the Resettlement Administration. The armory here in town was built 100  percent by it, and all those armories. You see these rock armories  around? They were built, and if you see a bridge that looks like it has a  rock banister, that was built by them. They put the sewer system in at  Glencoe, all hand-dug, every bit of it. WPA, public works did that. My  father was lucky in a way. We had to watch the money real close, but we  never were on public assistance. Never did have to get on.  And was the Soil Conservation Service doing much work around here,  just Lake Carl Blackwell?  The Soil Conservation was building terraces on those farms to keep  them from blowing away. They were also planting cedar trees in western  Oklahoma, cedar trees and honey locusts. Now they   re a pest tree, but  they started that. They did that for wind breaks. The big machinery out  there, I think Blackwell was a triple-C,  Civilian  Conservation Corps.  That was a young man   s deal. Maybe you   ve heard of it, where people  could go join that. A lot of them ended up joining the Army in World  War II. In fact, we had a hired hand. Daddy could make more money  and keep a hired hand that lived at the house. He was on the Death  March at Corregidor. Won   t ever know what happened to him.  Really?  He was in the CCC camp down at Fort Sill, and when the war started,  they turned them into the military right away. That was their military  base. Mount Scott, if you   ve been up Mount Scott, that was CCC camp,  and WPA built that in conjunction. That little town below there where  that swimming pool wall is, that   s WPA work. They did all that. If you  go to Pawnee, there   s a big armory. All the armories were built. Perry  armory, Noble County. Each county had an armory. This one was down  on Ninth Street. That was the armory. The one at Pawnee, as you go out  on  Highway  64, the one in Perry is just south of the hospital. Those are  the three I know of real well, and they   re all built alike. This really chills  me when our president mentions shovel-ready jobs. He doesn   t even  know what a shovel is. This was shovel-ready when they were digging.     We   ve got to stake that. You start digging.    That   s what they did. They  put that sewer line in at Glencoe without any backhoes or anything. It  was all hand-dug.  22  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Has that sewer line been redone since then, or is it still there?  No, it   s still there. I have a little problem with it. The sewer is above my  farm. They have big lagoons, but those lagoons leak sometimes. I own a  farm up there. The old family farm, where I grew up in the older days, I  still have it.  Well, what else would you do whenever you came to town? Was it  always on a Saturday?  It was usually on a Saturday. Oh, we went to a movie. We went to a  Western, probably a double feature, at the Mecca Theater.  Were westerns your favorite?  Oh, it was then. I tell you what. We always figured we fed the rats and  mice from popcorn. Get a nickel   s worth of popcorn, you go to a movie  for a dime. That was a pretty good deal.  Do you remember the first movie you ever saw?  I don   t remember. Probably like Tom Mix or something like that. It was  all shoot   em up and kill   em, you know. (Laughter)  Would your parents go to a movie, or would they just talk to their  friends?  They   d talk to their friends. Now, my parents did one thing that a lot of  parents didn   t do. I think we attended every musical concert they had at  OSU. We would do that. They   d have them a lot on Sunday afternoons,  like the glee choir or something would be singing. My brother sang in it,  and my sister sang in it. We would attend all those. When they   d have  these, like they have down east of here, you know the summer deal?  They used to have them up there at Old Central, east of Old Central.  On the lawn?  On the lawn. We   d sit out there on the lawn and watch that. We always  made sure we went to those. All of us, the whole family, sang in the  choir. My mother, my sister, my brother, and myself also sang at a lot of  funerals around here, quartets.  Did your parents play any musical instruments?  Mother was a very good musician. She taught piano. She would play the  23  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  piano, and we   d do the singing. A lot of our evenings were spent at  home just around the piano.  Did you always have a piano?  Oh, yes. Mother had that piano when she was in college up here. She   s a  good pianist. When she was ninety-four years old, the Sunday before she  broke her hip out here at Westhaven  Nursing Home , she played hymns  for the group that was out there. She was hard of hearing, and she was  blind. I   d say,    Mother, play this.    She   d go with her hands like that  (Gestures) on the piano keys. She   d find them. She   d find them, and  pretty soon she   d start playing it. I   d hum in her ear how it went, how  the song went. She   d pick it up.  That   s incredible.  Blind and did that. Have to help her to the piano. I don   t know whether  you know Gerald Bradshaw or not here in town. Gerald   s father was  there every Sunday morning listening to that. (Laughter)  That   s neat. Is there anything else you would do around town? What  about other forms of entertainment?  I   ll tell you. When we went down to the grandparents   , there were the  Yoakums that lived south of there and the Leiningers. There were two  boys there in that deal. We would roam that creek. If you   ve been to  where the little schoolhouse is out there     Pleasant Valley?     Pleasant Valley, you know where you turn west and there   s a lake as  you cross? That   s old Leininger Lake. We   d go skinny dipping. We   d  walk over there and go swimming. That was a little pond at that time,  but we did that. That   s the way we spent the days. We went up there. We  knew Phillip would be home, and Joe Yoakum would be there. Away we  went. Parents didn   t worry about us along the creek there. They figured  we were safe.  Did you ever go to Crystal Plunge?  Yes. I   ll tell you how we got into that, getting in cheap. You   d go down  to Perkins Road. You know where Sight and Sound is and all that, or  used to be? You could walk across there and get in the back gate. We  used to do that. In fact, I owned that land until I decided not to stay in  the dealership up here.  24  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  So where exactly was Crystal Plunge?  Crystal Plunge was behind Stillwater Mill, on the south side of  Stillwater Mill, back a bit. You drove down like where those trucks  drive toward the mill. You drove in behind there, and that   s where  Crystal Plunge was.  Was it up against Stillwater Creek, there?  Yes, it was right close to Stillwater Creek. We used to go to Yost Lake,  too.  How would you get there?  We   d see how many we could get in the car and how many we could get  in the trunk, and we   d take off and go to Yost Lake. They got wise to  that, and they   d raise the trunk. One of the things we   d do at Yost Lake,  though, when we lived up in Glencoe, we   d ride the horses over there.  They had a stable on the southwest side of that property. Put our horses  in there. We   d spend two nights there, and we got in free because we  cleaned up the yard. We slept in the pavilion. Do you remember the  pavilion when it was on the lake? There used to be one out on the lake.  You   d hear that water thrashing underneath you. Sleep there on the  floor.  Wow. Were many people living out there, or did they have the cabins out  there then?  Yes, they had cabins there at the time. The Westmorelands ran that, and  they were the ones that knew to check the trunk. (Laughter)  So there was normally a charge?  Oh, yes, they charged so much per head, of people they could see. That  was too many to have in the trunk, so we   d have to pay if you didn   t get  by with it.  Do you remember how much it cost per head?  Probably about a quarter, less than that. Maybe a dime. It wasn   t much.  Would the train come through there?  Yes. I was a mule skinner on the railroad once, too. When they had to  widen that dam, it was when they closed during Christmas vacation for  the school. A fellow was looking for someone to help with an old slip  25  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  and two mules. My brother and I hired on two-for-one. He held the slip,  or I would, and we   d haul the dirt up there. The kids laugh about it, tell  them I was a mule skinner on the railroad. (Laughter)  But that just lasted for a week or two?  That lasted a couple of weeks. That was it, but it paid a little money. Got  over there at four o   clock in the morning. Take the old car, the old  Plymouth. Didn   t have antifreeze then, so you   d put warm water in it  and go over there and drain it. Then you add warm water, fill it up with  water, drive home, and drain it out again. That was it.  What else would you do at Yost Lake?  Oh, they had a good swimming pool there. They had a big slide and  everything. They had boats. We   d row all over the place. Just had a good  time. That was it.  Would you bring a picnic?  No, no, no. They fed us because we cleaned up the place. They had a  little snack bar, so they fed us. The Westmorelands were neighbors of  my parents, so we got by in pretty good shape that way.  Then back to Crystal Plunge, what would you do at Crystal Plunge?  Swim all afternoon until we were washed out, like when you see your  hands are shriveled up and everything. (Laughs) Did you know you  could rent bathing suits? Yes. (Laughter) We didn   t know who all wore  them, but we   d rent them. We   d have to rent a bathing suit because we  didn   t take it with us. The bathing suit had a big safety pin with a  number on it so you   d know the suit you turned in.  Wow, they had men   s and women   s?  Men   s and women   s, yes.  What about Ripley Bluffs? Did you ever go out there?  No, I never did go to Ripley Bluffs. Have you been out there?  No, I haven   t.  I know where it   s at, but I never did go there. We used to play Ripley in  basketball. That was one of the rivals.  26  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  From Glencoe?  Yes, and Perkins was the other one.  So you played basketball in high school?  Yes.  Did you play any other sports?  No, just basketball. I had to be the janitor. I was also drove that school  bus to ballgames.  How old were you when you started driving the school bus?  About fourteen. (Laughter) It had single wheels on it, and one night I ran  off the side, and I thought things were going to upset. Had to crank it. It  was during World War II. You couldn   t get buses. Had a    36 model  International, and I rolled it over. I upset that bus.  With people on it?  Yes. There was only three on there, and the darn guys kicked out the  windows. They didn   t need to kick it out, but they did it just to see how  much damage they could do to it. (Laughter)  Wow.  One of them works for the gas company, or retired. Dean Carrier was  one of them. You darn guys, kicking    (Laughter)  So how did you get that gig of driving the school bus?  Well, I was a good tractor driver and could drive the car real well and  they decided to   you could get a special permit to drive that bus. There  were two girls who liked to smoke. They wanted to smoke, and they   d  bum. I smoked a little Bull Durham, and they   d want it. I got upset with  them one evening. I went out and cut some grapevines, and I said,    Try  those.    They laugh about it. Mary Ruth Dean still laughs about those  grapevines. (Laughter)  So would that be on the bus?  Yes, they   d be on the bus. If they wanted to smoke   they   d be the last  ones off. They wanted to bum a cigarette, so I stopped and got some  grapevines.    Try those.    (Laughter)  27  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  What was the bus? What kind of vehicle?  It was a    36 International. Instead of having rows of seats like they have  today, it had benches on the side. That was the first one, and the other  one was a    40 model Ford. Both of them, the starters didn   t work. You  had to crank them.  Were there several routes in Glencoe, or was it just one?  They had four bus routes. Believe me, they didn   t have any roads worth  a hoot at that time.  In Glencoe?  Oh, the bus routes were terrible. What they would do, if you got off the  bus route by two o   clock (mind you, you   re in the mud from seven thirty  until two getting in) they counted it as a day. Most generally, you   re  there an hour, and you went back home is what it was. (Laughter)  Wow.  You couldn   t depend on the students to help you get one out of the ditch.  They   d push it in. (Laughter) You   d have to get a farmer to pull you out  with a tractor. Bobby Grote lives here in town, (he   s from Glencoe) and  he said,    I remember when that bus upset. I remember when you went  by and all of a sudden, heard a bunch of crunching there and kicking,  and those guys were breaking windows out.    (Laughs) So his dad pulled  it out, straightened it up, put it on its wheels. We started it up and went  on.  So would the windows be repaired?  They never were repaired. We junked that one. That was junk, anyway,  that bus was. See, the schools today, we have it so much different than  what we had there. The school board would buy a new bus. They   d buy  just the wheels, the running gears. My father was on the school board for  about sixteen years. We would take it down to Hugo, Oklahoma, sitting  on a crate and have a body put on it and then drive it home.  Why Hugo?  Industrial Body Company was down there. They made those. The rest of  them were out of state, see, but that was the only one we could get put  on. Industrial Body Company. That same company exists today, by  International, and they   re made in Tulsa.  28  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Really?  Yes. That   s what the schools are using here right now. Those were  dangerous buses back then. That bus that I rolled over had slick tires in  front, oversized tires to start with, and it   d just go like that down the  road. You just had trouble steering. I got in a deep rut, and when I got  out, I over-steered and went off the side, put it on its side.  How many people were in your class?  Graduated from high school? Twelve of us. Big bunch.  (Laughs) What else do you remember about school in Glencoe?  Oh, I had a Model T Ford, stripped down, and gave twelve dollars and  fifty cents for it. Got it running good, and I remember taking it to play  hooky one day. The whole class did because Phyllis Shell had a birthday  and we were going to celebrate it out at a pond out there. So we all went  out and rode on that old Model T and went out there.  Your whole class?(Laughs)  Yes, the class. (Laughter) We were sitting on the sides. They were  stacked everywhere on that old Model T. We went out there, and the  superintendent promised that he was going to give us all spankings. So  the next day I went in there, and all the boys did, with overalls and  packed them with magazines. (Laughs)  Did that work?  Yes. Pow  Pow  We   d go,    Ooh     and jump forward. They   d put your  hands down like that, and be in the gymnasium. Mr. Clark just gave up  after about three of us. (Laughter) He was through with that. That wasn   t  going to work.  So did you get many spankings in school?  That   s the only one I ever got is senior year  Senior year.  What were your favorite subjects in school?  History. Straight A in history and English, both, on that.  Who was your teacher?  29  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Andy Murphy. Do you remember Andy Murphy? Taught here in  Stillwater schools for years. He was before your time, that   s right. Mrs.  McFarlane was the English teacher. I was short one book report to  graduate from high school, and she said,    Don   t you know of any of  them?    I said,    Well, I know Luther   s Catechism from one end to the  other.    I had it memorized. That was my book report. That worked. It  was a book.  When did the town of Glencoe start slowing down a bit?  Oh, really started after they put the turnpike in. The banker did not want  a turnoff there. He said it brings scum in town. I said,    Look, Clarence,  there   s already a lot of trash in this town. You can   t put any more in it.     It started dying down. The school is active. You ought to see the school  up there. It   s nice. In fact, Stillwater played them just recently. The  school is big up there, but that   s all that   s there right now: school, two  service stations. No grocery stores. They   re gone.  That really makes an impact on a town.  They actually had three good grocery stations. You heard of Mac   s Body  Shop here in town? His parents grew up there, too. His parents owned  that grocery store.  Really?  Yes.  What were their names?  McCubbin. McCubbins that had the body shop, so that   s part of the  family.  What was the grocery store called?  One was McCubbins Grocery Store, the other was Shell   s, and the other  one was Sawyer   s. They put in a locker plant. Boy, that was great. We  could freeze our meat, then. That helped a lot. Then we could butcher  beef.  Was there an ice plant?  No ice plant, no.  What about in Stillwater? Did you ever have need for ice? Did your  grandparents have ice?  30  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Down here where the   let   s see. The parking lot just west of the B and  C  Business Products , Midwest Creamery was there, and they had an  ice plant. Then right behind the jail, between the jail and that  lumberyard, there was another plant. It was Payne County Creamery.  They had an ice plant. One of the things we would do (that was our  Sunday dessert) was go and get a twenty-five  pound  chunk of ice, put  it on the back of that old Dodge, wrap it up, go home and bring Molly in,  which was the cow. I could ride her in. She knew good and well she   d  get special feed. Milk Molly, and then we   d freeze ice cream. That was a  good treat, and we did that all as a family. My parents, actually, we  raised two other kids from Glencoe. The father was alcoholics in both  cases, and they just lived out there. We had them out there most of the  time.  Would you come into Stillwater to go to church?  Yes, we always came to Stillwater. We were not considered too good of  residents of that community because the church was here. Everything  was here. They had a Methodist, a Baptist, and a Christian church, and  we didn   t go there. But, see, you figure out that was a get-together, also,  because my grandmother and grandfather were here. The Rinks were  here when Mother knew them. They   d all get together for church. Right  across from the church where the parking lot is, the senior citizens now,  you know where they eat? They call that a home ec building. If we   d  have a big festival, the school just let us use it. We didn   t have to rent it.  They just let us use it. They had a kitchen and everything there. We were  right across the street from it. That church didn   t even have an enclosed  restroom when I first went there. It had a little outhouse in an alley. That  was it.  When did your home get indoor plumbing?  After I left. I graduated from high school in 1948. I took a job the day  after that at Hull Motor Company, the Dodge dealership here. I was  going to go to college, but I kept getting raises. The military took me for  a year, and then they took me for two more. One of the brothers died, the  Hall brothers. They called me from Fort Sill wanting to know if I   ll be a  pallbearer for the funeral. I went up there as a pallbearer. They made an  offer when I got out of the service, on profit sharing. I started in    57, and  I bought everything out in    78.  And what was that called before?  Hull Motor Company, then it was Paul L. Burch Dodge. You  probably   would you remember that? That was like    70s, early    70s.  31  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  No.  Okay. Then I bought it, and it was Oltmanns Motors. I bought the  buildings and everything. The reason I sold it was Kevin called me.  Kevin wanted to talk to me one day. I was on him pretty heavy down at  the shop. He had worked down there and helped detail cars. He   d visit  with the mechanics, and I said,    Leave them alone. They need to work.        Well, they want to visit.       They   re politicking is all they   re doing.      Kay  was working in the office after school. They wanted to talk to me.  I said,    Oh, now what? They   re mad at me.    They said,    We have both  decided we   re going to go to medical school. We don   t want anything to  do with the dealership.    And they did. I paid their way through. They  came through debt free, so I felt real good about that. In    92, I sold it  out.  And that was located     At 113 East Ninth. If you   ll go down on Lewis Street, you see a little old  building with, I think, four awnings on it. Fellow builds furniture in  there. That   s where my body shop was. I still have that half block down  in there yet, but a fellow builds furniture in that building.  The white building?  The little white building, yes. He builds Japanese furniture.  Yes, Morgan Robinson.  Morgan. Morgan has just paid his rent here yesterday or something like  that. (Laughs) I know Morgan real well. I knew the family. She used to  rent that big building and have a Christmas store there every year.  Oh, really?  Yes, Morgan   s mother used to do that. Morgan, they got a new baby.  I heard that.  You know what they named it?  No.  Chisel. (Laughter) Now, wait, he explained that. That was kind of  interesting. There   s a Japanese word that is almost like it. It sounds like  that   s what they say. It   s a Japanese name, but he said in American, just  32  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  say Chisel.  (Laughter) That   s neat, him being a woodworker. So did you attend  Oklahoma A M at all?  Nope. I took some business courses, and I was real fortunate at Chrysler.  I was even on their advisory council to save Dodge trucks. I served  about ten years on the advisory council for them. Lee Iacocca is a good  friend of mine.  Some of your siblings went to Oklahoma A M?  They went to OSU, all of them, the two of them. I   ve got two  grandchildren up here now. One   s in engineering, and the other one is in  the School of Business. Got two granddaughters in high school. Got one  grandson in junior high. Michael   s in computer engineering. He thinks  he   s going to get rich.  How did your World War II time with the military come about?  I was in the naval reserve unit down here, and I   d served almost a year  of active duty, and the ship was going to go to Korea. It was going to be  for two years. It   d be over a year and then another year, about. They  said,    You   ve got a choice. You can go back to your unit here in  Stillwater.    I decided to go back. Commander  J. Andrew  Holly, he was  in the School of Business, I think up here, or the School of Education.  He was the commander. He said,    Where are you going to serve that  other year?    I said,    I   m not going to serve it.    He said,    I guarantee  you, you will.    I said,    No, death and taxes are the only guarantee.     I went down to the National Guard unit here, and I talked to James  Longan. He said,    What   s your MOS  Military Occupational  Specialty ?    which would be my job. I said,    Radar operator.       There   s  a flyer right there. They need radar operators at Fort Sill.    So he called  the Fourth Army at the time, and I was gone to the Army. That was it.  The shore patrol came after me, and they couldn   t find me. I served two  more years there, so that gave me almost nine years. I   d been with Fort  Polk a few times. I   d been around. They knew it, and the 45th was going  to Fort Polk. They said,    You want to go to Fort Polk?    Lawrence Roy  was a good friend of mine at the time. I said,    Might as well,    so I went  there, and I got to thinking,    I   m going to finish that out.    I put in  twenty-seven years all total. It   s a pretty good retirement, and they took  care of all my wife   s hospital bills.  And that started in the    50s.  33  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  That started in the    50s. I went in the service, went on active duty, in     55, the thirty-first of January, and got out in    57, out of the Army. The  Navy, I messed around with them for a long time. They threatened to  send me on active duty. I messed around with them until    54, and then I  went to Fort Hood, Texas, with the 45th. Then I went on active duty  right after that. It was good to me. I had a good tour.  How did the community change during World War II back when you  were still in school?  Well, right after World War II, all those GIs came back. You know  where the hospital is now? That was a village of cardboard. The whole  thing was, all it was. They started tearing those down, started building  new houses. Actually, in the northeast part of town, they built a lot of GI  houses. Leonard Herron came here, and Leonard Herron   s family today  still own the largest lumber mills in southeastern Oklahoma. He shipped  the lumber up here and started building houses. You go down on Miller  Street, all those houses down there, those were built during that time.  The Lutheran Church, where it is now, you jumped off a road into dirt  roads from there on out. You didn   t have any roads there.  North?  North. The road actually went   it was a boulevard going down Duck  Street with a nice center deal in there. Then it dropped off there, and  you   d go on a dirt road. That was the only road you had out that way. Of  course, they built Vet Village, which were little shacks at that time out  there. Built all those up. That was right after World War II. All these  south of the hospital clear on down to the creek was all military camps.  That was all military at the time. They used those old shacks. In fact, a  friend of mine, he and his wife lived in there after World War II and  went to school on a GI bill. They were just pasteboard shacks is all they  were, cardboard or something, black-looking shacks. I could live in a  one-room shack here at that time. My wife, Marlene, never wanted to  show the grandkids where we moved to when we came back and  couldn   t find housing. Had one big room, had a bathroom, and had a  kitchen. That was it.  You couldn   t find housing. I finally bought a house on Miller Street,  nice house, there. That house was built right after World War II, also.  Oh, I   ve seen the town grow. It is growing. Where the shopping center is  at McElroy and Perkins Road, Mr. Basler was postmaster at the time. He  said,    Well, you   ve got that farm in Glencoe.    I bought it and owed the  money to my mother. He said,    Why don   t you buy that? I   ll finance all  of it.    A hundred and sixty. Look what it   d have been worth today  I  didn   t want to go in debt that deep, you know. (Laughter) Then on  34  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Perkins Road and Hall of Fame, that place down there. Fellow wanted to  trade it, twenty acres. He wanted to trade that for a car. Perkins Road  wasn   t even open, see? Just trails. Then I bought that down where Sight  and Sound, from the mill down south. I was going to build a dealership  there, then the bust came on in the    80s, and I didn   t want to do that.  What happened to Crystal Plunge?  The Stillwater Mill bought it. They filled it in. They park all their trucks  back there.  Did you ever go to the Rock Castle?  Oh, absolutely. That was neat. Do you remember that?  No, I don   t. I   ve just heard about it.  It was real nice. It was neat. Good place.  Where was it located?  The Rock Castle was located where the Moose Lodge is today, right in  that area.  And they had a little pond.  Stream, yes, they had a little stream down there. It was cute. It was a  nice place. When I had that Model T, we used to drive it from Glencoe  down there. It didn   t have lights on it. We   d park it there in the park.  We figured if the sheriff got us for something, (we didn   t have a title) I   d  just give it to him and walk home. That was how I was going to get out  of that, (Laughs) just give him the     That was your plan? (Laughs)  That was my plan. (Laughter)  What about Lake Carl Blackwell? When did that start becoming a place  to hang out?  In the    40s.  Would you ever go out there?  Oh, yes. Yes. We used to have our family reunions out there, and my  uncles would go fishing and catch a lot of fish out there. It was real nice.  35  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Were there places to eat?  Yes, they had picnic tables and everything out there. Around where  those cabins are, they had a nice area in there.  I   ve heard later about a restaurant-type place?  They had a beautiful restaurant, a fish restaurant, a catfish restaurant. I  don   t know why it closed. The university took all of it over. It wasn   t  making what they wanted. The sailing club had to have a building or  something there, but it was a nice restaurant.  Are there any other towns in the area that you would go to for  entertainment or for any reason?  I met my wife. She was from Perry.  Okay. How did you meet her?  I met her through the church. I was president of what we called a District  Luther League that covered everything from Tulsa to Darrouzett, Texas,  and Oklahoma City. I was president of it, and that   s where I met her.  Then we started having our league meetings together here in Stillwater  because they didn   t have enough there and we didn   t have enough here,  so we started meeting together.  What year did you meet her?  I met her in    52, I guess it was. Married her in    54.  And she was a member of     Zion Lutheran at Perry.  That was kind of the brother church or sister church of the Stillwater     Yes, it was. It absolutely was. The pastor served both churches. A. J.  Duis, he served both of them at the time.  A. J. what?  Duis was his name, D-U-I-S.  So had she grown up in Perry, then, your wife?  36  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Yes, she grew up on a farm out northeast of Perry.  Her parents had migrated from     Yes, they migrated here. In fact, we wondered whether we weren   t  related at one time because her mother was related to one side of the  family that mine was. My mother was related to the other side.    Wait  just a minute, here,    you know. (Laughter) Got to comparing notes.     We   d better watch, here.     Well, were there many Germans from Russia in the Perry area?  Oh, yes, it was large there, yes. There was a bunch of them in there.  They had a church out southeast of Perry, off on a dirt road. They   ve got  a beautiful cemetery out there. It was a larger church than the Stillwater  church.  Does it still exist?  The church is there, but it   s on a highway now. That   s on Highway 64.  Well, when did Salem get moved to this new building?  Where we are now?  Yes, in Stillwater.  In 1957 we moved to the church where it is now, present location.  Which is on Duck and Elm?  Duck and Elm, yes.  Was there a big fundraising drive or something to establish that?  Oh, yes. I   m on the fundraising drive right now to get a good parking lot  put in there.  Oh, on the south side?  On the south and east side. We own everything clear on down to the  other street, see. There   s a good place to park. The college uses that a  lot, and we could rent that if we had some real good concrete there and  had it marked. I said it could make the payoff because those kids park  eighty cars in there at football games and they get twenty dollars a car.  Those kids go on trips all over. They   ve got a lot of money in the bank. I  37  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  said,    They better start paying for the parking lot, put some money back  in it.    Then it would be making more money, see.  Has that congregation changed much over the years?  Yes, it   s changed a lot. There   s a lot of Swedish and, well, English  people, in other words, that aren   t from that part of the country. There   s  quite a few Swedish people there right now. Danish, I think there   s two  people originated from Denmark that are there, which the Lutheran  church is the key church in those countries. There   s a lot of people that  are right from here, you know, that joined the church. We have Johnsons  and Sandvolds. Those names are not English, you know. (Laughs) But  no, we have quite a number.  When you were growing up, were the sermons given in German?  They were given in German until 1945.  Really?  Pastor Martin Luther Schrader said,    We   re going to start English  services.    He mentioned the Sunday. He said,    Those that want to come  to German service will have to be there at three o   clock,    and did that  cause an uproar  (Laughter)  I bet.  We were having one Sunday in German and one Sunday in English.  That wasn   t going to work, you know. He said,    We   ll have German  services at three in the afternoon.    Pretty well-attended, and then it got  to be less and less and less because those people could understand  English. We have German service once a year there.  Christmas?  Yes. I can follow it. I can   t read it, but I know where they are. I just take  the sermon as it   s printed and know where he   s at in it all the way.  Do they sing any German songs, still?  Yes, yes.  Just at this service or regularly?  No, just at this service. They sing mostly Christmas carols. They were  all sang in German then. It kind of brings back memories.  38  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Did you speak German when you were a child, then?  I spoke it, yes, but you forget it. These new people at the university, the  vice president would he be, or what do they call him?  The provost?  The provost. His wife is from Germany, from Heidelberg. I visited with  her, and she said,    You know, you forget it pretty fast.    She   d bought a  new Honda and she had her head turned round. What I mean by that, she  couldn   t understand why the seatbelt light didn   t come on on the right  side when you sit on the seat. I finally figured it out. I said,    Now look  Karin, I   m eighty-two years old. I   m zwei und achtzig which would be  two and eight. In English it   s eight and two. So you   re thinking  backwards.    She started laughing and said,    You know, that   s right.  That   s the way I was thinking about it.    (Laughter)  Another difference I   ve noticed with German books, when they   re in a  bookshelf, they   re the opposite direction. The title goes the other  direction.  I   m having my great-grandparents    Bible redone, and we   re going to use  it at the next German service.  Neat. Wow. Where are you getting it redone?  I   m having it rebound right here in town. Sherry Helt can do it. She  looked at it and said,    The pages are real good. I can rebind that.    That   s  what I wanted her to do. That   s the one they brought from Russia, the  Bible, so we   ll read out of that one.  So it   s German script. Does it have much handwriting in it, throughout?  There   s quite a few notes in there. I told her,    Don   t throw the notes  away in there    because there   s notes in there that are real interesting. It  was my great-grandfather   s is whose it was.  Wow, that   s neat.  You want to know how I found that? It was kind of dumb. Marlene put  in a bookcase, had things in the bookcase. Kevin said,    What   s that book  that looks so old?    Pulled it out, and that was the Bible. She was using it  to prop the clock up with.  Oh, what a find   39  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  That was the idea. He said,    Let   s don   t get rid of that. Let   s get it  rebound if we can.    Sherry is going to do it. She   s working on it. She   s  an airline hostess or stewardess, so she doesn   t have a lot of time, but  she   s good at that.  Well, tell me about your children. You had two children.  Two children, yes. They both live in town. One lives at Nottingham, and  one is building a new house in Boulder Creek. The one in Boulder Creek  has two girls and a boy. She   s the one that   s a speech and language  pathologist. Kevin is internal medicine at the Warren Clinic. He came  here in 1990, so he   s been there quite a long while. They check on me  every day. (Laughter) It   s kind of funny.  Did they both graduate from Stillwater High School?  Both graduated Stillwater High School, both graduated from OSU, and  both graduated from OU. Their blood is still orange. Only thing, he  won   t buy basketball tickets up here. He   s kind of witty sometimes.  They said,    Well, you   re going to miss those seats. You may never have  those.    He said,    Well, you worry about selling seats. I   ll worry about  the tickets. Besides, did you ever buy a car before you tried it out?  We   ve got Ford as a new coach.    He said,    I don   t know whether he   s  worth anything or not.    (Laughter) It   s kind of funny the way he ended  the conversation with them. But now they   re about giving seats away  sometimes to get people to go.  Yes. Some games are exciting. (Laughs)  Oh, yes. Now that the football team has kind of turned around.  What are some businesses that you remember supporting as you were  growing up? Where would you buy your clothes?  I   d buy them at Katz or Bates Brothers, those two places. I have some  Zorba coat hangers. I had coffee with Jack yesterday morning. Jack is  still around, Jack Zorba.  Where was Zorba   s?  Zorba   s was down just about three doors south of Stillwater National  Bank, in that area. J. C. Penney, didn   t get much at Penney   s. Katz was  the popular place to buy clothes, and I bought my shoes there. In fact,  when Katz sold out, I   ve still got two of the nicest shirts that fit me from  Katz. Right now, it   s hard to find a shirt that   s seventeen and a half in  40  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  the neck that   ll fit me. I found this one the other day at a bargain in a  western store, but you just don   t find clothes that are built to fit  somebody with a heavy neck. I can button that up. I even tried Belk   s.  Theirs are cut awful short, their clothes.  Well, did you know any of the Katzes personally?  Oh, yes, I knew Jake real well. Jake Katz    daughter, Helen, and my  mother went to school together. She lived here in the country club for  quite a long while. What Jake did, he came from Germany, and he sent  them to the Lutheran Church School out here west of town.  Where was that?  That   s out where the cemetery is. It   s the one I told you, you went up to  Vassor Road, turn, and then you went back east.  Does the building exist out there anymore?  No, the building doesn   t exist, just the cemetery. I can show you where  the building was. That   s why I asked if you wanted to go for a driving  tour. I   d show you some of these places. (Laughter)  Yes, I do.  Like Yates    store. That   s where central was, by Camp Redlands. That   s  where the telephone offices operated out of.  For this whole area?  For that area out there. The farmers put up their own phone lines and  maintained them. They had a central (they plugged in the numbers) at  that Yates    store out there. That was the central. You   ve been to  Redlands? You see some forms of some old buildings before you get in.  That   s where that store was there.  Okay. What about pharmacies in town?  I still use Tiger or Central. I have for years and years. They   re home  owned. I don   t want to use Wal-Mart, even though that   s been part of  my living is Wal-Mart stock, but still. (Laughter) I use Tiger, and it was  Central Drug at the time. The reason I was so attached to those, they  were at Katz, and they bought their cars from me. Earl Fisher bought his  cars and trucks from me. So why wouldn   t you trade with them? We  always looked to trade with people who traded with us. That was the  way I told Marlene.    You go here and go there. Bates, they were good  41  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  customers, so you use them.    Zorba bought a car. I remember that.    Go  trade with them.     That   s something that changes a community, when big box stores come  in.  That changes, right there. It changed it a lot. See, all the car dealers were  downtown (did you know that?) at one time.  Oh, yes.  Buick was just a block this side of Cooksey   s and across the alley. The  Oldsmobile dealer was down where the Walgreen   s store is now,  Walgreen   s Drug. Owen Thomas was downtown, and Simpson Pontiac  was down at Sixth and Washington. They were all right here, see. We  had a good association down at   Forrest Barnett was straight this way  where   what do they call that when they blow glass and all that?  Oh, the Multi Arts.  Multi Arts, that   s where Forrest Barnett, the Nash dealer, was. His  slogan, (they had the first reclining seats)    Call me for rest.    (Laughter)  My slogan was,    If you try one, you   ll buy one,    on Dodge. (Laughs)  That   s good. Did you ever attend any events or have any reason to go to  the schools, the high school or the junior high, that   s now     Down here is a basement. You know that. In here we used to have  square dance classes down here.  Square dance classes in the basement of the high school?  Of this school right here, yes. We had square dance lessons down there.  I tried to square dance, but I wasn   t that good.  Did you ever go to dances in any of the dance halls in town, the Cat   s  Hall or Peck   s Lodge?  No, but I went to Bohemian Hall at Perry. That   s north of Perry.  Marlene and I used to go out there. All of her family had played in the  band, (they still do) the Voices, up by Morrison. They still have their  band. In fact, if I go out to Ingalls tomorrow night, her cousin would be  playing piano, and she   s ninety years old.  Where at Ingalls?  42  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  At the old schoolhouse in Ingalls. They start at five thirty, and they quit  at eight. You stand up, sing    God Bless America,    and you   re on your  way home. That   s it. (Laughter) I used to go to dances in the armory.  Okay.  Had a lot of dances there.  Were those public dances, or was it a certain group of people?  The National Guard would hold those. Conway Twitty started out here  in Stillwater. Did you know that?  I don   t think so.  Conway was here. He was one of our favorites we   d like to have come  here.  Wow. So did he start out at the armory?  He was at the armory. He would come down there. I bet he only got  maybe two hundred dollars a night or something, but he would come up  here. Kind of interesting. Johnny Cash, Southern Club for twenty five  dollars a week down at Lawton.  Wow.  That   s where I first saw Johnny, when I was in the service.  How was he?  He was good. He was good. He was trying to get started at the time. He  did real well in his time, didn   t he?  Yes. Have you heard many other musicians that have come through  town, or comedians?  No, not really. Oh, Bob Hope, do you remember when Bob Hope came  to town? Do you remember that?  I don   t remember when he came to town.  Bob came to town, and he was at the Gallagher Iba. I attended his big  program that night. I thought that was good. Most generally, we went to  Bohemian Hall to dance. That was it because it was all family.  43  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Were you very interested in OSU sports, athletics?  I kind of got burned out. The reason why, I furnished them cars for  years. When I sold out, they wanted a thousand dollars to park my motor  home, plus another two-thousand-dollar donation, plus belong to the  POSSE Club, plus buy tickets. I said,    No way.    I wouldn   t do that  anymore. It was all a money deal. They let me park my motor home.  When the games were on, the kids had a place to come over and shoot  the breeze and all that. They changed completely when I sold out. I went  to a lot of games, though. I always had free tickets because I furnished  cars. We went to a lot of football games and a lot of basketball games  here.  Who would you furnish the cars for?  To the athletic department. My seat in Gallagher Iba was right by Henry  Iba. Got to sit over there. Pat Hofler was just buried yesterday. Pat  would bring the stats over to Henry, and he   d bring me a copy of them.  (Laughter) I got to travel with the team.  Really?  I went to Iowa, went to Kansas, went to Missouri, yes. Traveled on an  airplane with them. I usually took Kevin along. That was a good out for  him.  I bet. How young were you when you started attending sporting events  with the university?  I didn   t really get into them until I was    70s.  Okay, so as a child, you didn   t really     No, no, no. Oh, I went up there when we had bleachers at the football  games, yes. At halftime you got in free. They wouldn   t take any money  after that. Just let you walk in. That was a long time back. They just had  those old bleachers like the high school had at one time. A fellow by the  name of Ed Johndrow was quarterback for Missouri. He was a good one.  He   s a friend of mine. He said,    When they built this up this way like the  stadium is today, there was a fear I   d slide into the wall if I ran with the  ball,    especially when it was wet because it is so close compared to what  he was used to playing at. He said,    This is a hard one to play in.    He  worked for Chrysler when I had the dealership. He was telling me all  about that.  What about local eating establishments?  44  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Skeen   s. His last place was where Cooksey   s is today, where the  grocery    They had a big cafeteria there. Smith   s Caf   was another  good place. Our Jaycees met there. Then the Chicken House. You ever  hear of the Chicken House?  I   ve heard of it.  Well, we   d eat there.  Where was that?  That was where the mattress store is, catty-corner from where the old  theater is. It was in that area.  Okay, where House of Flowers was?  Yes, House of Flowers, in that area. Katherine Lucas ran that. Taylor   s  was another one that we   d hang around a lot of times. Mom   s, when it  was down here at Tenth and Main.  Okay.  It was down there. We hung out there, a bunch of kids, just kind of hang  out and go down there and eat.  So was it the same establishment that   s further south on main?  Yes. I went to Pawnee a lot. We went to Pawnee from Glencoe, and they  had the Coffee Cup there. That old boy, I sold him a car later on. He  said,    You know, I   ll tell you one thing about it. You never spent any  money there, but you all didn   t tear anything up, either.    (Laughter)  We   d spend a dime, wait for the late show. Then after the late show,  we   d go out east of Pawnee where  Highway  18 Ys off. There   s a  picnic bench there, and we   d visit until one or two o   clock in the  morning.  What was the theater in Pawnee called?  I don   t recall what it was. It was just around from the Coffee Cup, there,  so we   d walk around there to go to the movie.  Did you ever eat at Click   s in Pawnee?  Oh, yes, I still eat there. I was there just on a fundraiser a week ago on  Monday night. They had a fundraiser for that fellow that got killed on  45  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  the motorcycle. He was also a firefighter, volunteer firefighter, and she   s  here in the hospital, recovering from that accident. They had a big  fundraiser.  That   s been around quite a while?  Yes, it   s been around. That used to be the old Chrysler dealership.  Oh, really? That building?  Cook Motor Company was in there. I was showing this friend of mine. I  said,    That   s where they drove the car. There   s the showroom, and when  you went down the hallway that was where you drove your cars in to  have them serviced.    Kind of interesting.  What about pizza? When   s the first time you tried pizza?  When they had the pizza place out west of town where Braum   s is now.  Do you remember what that was called?  I don   t remember it right now. It didn   t stay there too long. That was the  first time they started making pizzas commercially that way. Now, the  one up on the campus     Hideaway?     Hideaway, he grew up there in that area. I   ve known him for all my  life. He grew up, actually, on Hester Street.  Richard Dermer?  Richard. His sister is something else. (Laughs) Her cat died. She had that  cat stuffed and put on that piano up there. I remember that so plainly,  that darn cat. (Laughter) She   s something else.  What about Eskimo Joe   s? It   s not quite as old.  I eat there every once in a while. See, I was on the city commission  when Stan Clark was building that up there. You know where that  parking lot is behind there? He put that in. He said,    I didn   t know you  had to have a city permit.    (Laughter) I told the commissioner,    He   s  dumb like a fox.    He knew good and well, but he already had it built. He  couldn   t have it taken out, then, see. He wanted to know what he had to  do to bring it up to city standards. My nephew had the  Mason Jar on  Washington Street  They all started out together. Three of them started  46  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  out in that. He went down and had the Mason Jar. Did you ever hear of  that?  No.  They would have tight blouse parties there and all that. (Laughs) Oh,  gosh.  So it was a bar?  It was a bar. It was the Mason Jar. That was the name of it. Ed  Eskridge   s son-in-law was in on that. There was three of them in on that  whole deal. Shoot, we laugh about that today.  What do you think about how Stillwater has changed over the years?  Well, it   s becoming a big city is what it   s really become. That   s it. It   s  spread out. It   s urban sprawl. I went off the city commission, and I still  say if I was younger I would push for refurbing downtown areas  completely. In other words, where the old houses were, take that whole  block and condemn it or something and put it back for sale for nice  housing. That   s one of the reasons I   m keeping that lot down there,  because that old furniture store is down there, and someday they think  they   re going to build apartments up there. I don   t know. If they do, I   d  have parking for them.  What years were you on the city commission?  From 1976 to 1980, which was four years. I finished out a full term.  Then I was six years on the planning commission, right after I got off  that.  What is it about this area that has kept you here throughout your life?  Okay, my father always said   now, you think about something. You see  real estate just go up and then go down to nothing? Real estate never  goes down to nothing. It   ll level off, and then it   ll go up another tier and  then stay. This is the highest real estate market there is in the state, right  here. Another reason is we had good schools, and I figured that I wanted  to send my children to school and get them educated. Of course, you  have a tie in the church real deep, and I own land adjoining the city  limits, two hundred and forty acres out here that Kevin says,    Don   t you  ever sell. I want that.    I said,    I   m not going to develop it. You do  something with it.    So I just kind of stayed around here. Kept the  Glencoe farm, and it   s in the city limits up there now.  47  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  So is that land still being farmed?  None of Glencoe is being farmed. If you go on the turnpike where it Ys  off, you know where the Y goes, you look over to the south. There   s one  farm that has no cedar trees on it. That   s my farm. I don   t have any cedar  trees on it. It   s bare pasture. That   s it.  Did there used to be cedar trees?  You bet. I cut them all out, all but about five acres that I couldn   t get to.  I don   t know. I may never get it done. It   s been a good farm. It makes its  way. The farm out west of town was my grandfather   s old farm. The  reason the church got to Stillwater is on account of that farm. A fellow  divorced his wife, and he split it up three ways. He gave the church  eighty acres. The deal was for that eighty acres here out west of town by  the cemetery. In order to keep that eighty acres, they had to build a  church in town or within the city limits, boundaries, of Stillwater and  have an English-speaking pastor. They couldn   t build it on Stillwater  Creek, (it   d flood) so Granddad bought the farm. Now I have it. That   s  why I said Granddad built the church here in town, the first one.  That   s an important factor.  My uncle had it for years, and then my aunt was getting way up in years,  and I said,    Aunt Ann, you need to get somebody to take care of your  books on that farm.    I was doing it and didn   t know how else    She  said,    I   d like to sell it if somebody in the family would buy it,    so I  bought it the next morning. That was it.  Wow, that   s neat.  Kept it up. The Glencoe farm is one of the family farms, so I kept it.  Then we   ve got a farm at Perry, just little out of Perry. I   ve got it yet, so  I don   t have a reason to leave, really. (Laughs) And Marlene   s family all  lives up there, so they still consider me part of the family at family  reunions. Kind of nice to visit with them and do those things. Just enjoy  it.  Well, is there anything we haven   t talked about today that we should  cover at this point?  No. You   ve kind of separated why I stayed here, separated how I got in  business and what I think of Stillwater, which I think is a good viable  town. It   ll stay good.  What do you do today?  48  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  I drive cars for Barry Sanders. People say,    What do you do?    I said,    I  deliver Miss Daisy, and I go to the bank and go to the post office. That   s  it.    Joe Marcum works with me on it, so we kind of trade out.  Sounds like a pretty good gig.  It   s a pretty good gig. It really is. It   s only a mile and a quarter from the  house, mile and a half. Drive down the hill, I   m there.  And you get to visit with a lot of people.  Oh, yes, sure do. I visit with some people that are third generation, that  I   ve known, to buy cars, that I sold to first and second. You saw the  paper about the Point Four Program     Yes.     that the university had that went to Ethiopia? I sold to Luther Brannon  when he came back. He wrote me a letter,    Have a car for me.    The  Bennetts traded with me down there. I knew them all. You kind of get  tied to Stillwater. Like Swim   s, Leslie Swim and that family. The  Drummonds. I   ve been to their ranch and had some big parties. When  you know them all, they eventually drift into Stillwater. You just stay.  (Laughs)  Yes, some great relationships.  Jonathan   s mother grew up here. She had a big ranch. Her father had a  ranch northeast of Stillwater. Jonathan has that now. It was her dad that  tied me in with the big donation to buy that Century 21. We built that  from donations up at the university, the one that   s got all the stove pipes  on it?  Yes.  I got a donation, put in that, but they never did put Marlene   s name on  that. She never found that out.  But your name   s on it?  Yes, my name   s on it. My name   s also on the water plant out here, too.  Got it built in my time. I never went in that after I first saw that. I said,     Marlene, see that? It   s supposed to be both of our names on that.     That   s what I say. The university doesn   t care much. I made a donation  to a scholarship for OSU down at Okmulgee. That   s somewhere. No one  49  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  Wilson  Oltmanns  has any records of it.  Oh my goodness.  Just fades away. Kind of like if you do any business with the city or with  anyone today, make it legal. It was on a handshake that we gave money  and bought parking lots here in town with that two-story lot. I had  interest in that, and now I can   t park there. I got the minutes out the  other night. I have a copy in the car of where they told me I would have  a place. Just trying to put it under the rug. I don   t lose anything giving it  to the university. It went for a good purpose. All of it did.  Well, when history is written, what would you like for it to say about  you?  (Laughs) I   d like for it to say more than it did Uncle Doc, (he   s never  been mentioned in this) of the contributions I   ve made to Stillwater. I  think I made a lot of contributions. I educated two children that are back  here, and they live here. I figure what I did on city commission   I hold  a record for one thing: I sued the IRS and won it. I was on that  community action board, and I was on there just by name, really. I was  listed as being the treasurer. That gal never paid the withholding, the  FICA taxes, and they had me tied up for  125,000. I sued them, and they  said you couldn   t. I said,    I have already.    They said,    They don   t find a  record.    I said,    It   s in Tulsa, eastern district.       You can   t do that.    I  said,    Don   t tell me I can or can   t. They   ve accepted it.    That   s where  we had the trial. It cost me over twenty thousand dollars in attorney fees.  But the reason I wanted to get it done, why I sued them, they tied up  every piece of property I owned here in this county, the state of  Oklahoma, or anywhere in the United States that I owned property. They  put a lien on it, so I thought, well, wasn   t going to do that. You don   t do  that to me. That judge looked at that attorney and said,    Why do the  taxpayers pay your money?    First, he said,    Where   d you graduate  from?    Said,    Boston College.       Sonny, why did they ever send you  here to try something that wouldn   t work? I   m through. We   re through  for the day. This is over with.    Never did go to trial. I wanted to get it to  trial here in Payne County is what I wanted to do. They wouldn   t do  that. I figured they would in Oklahoma City. I knew this judge over  there, which helped me a lot. I wouldn   t want to go down as being the  drunken Main Streeter or nothing because I never was.  (Laughs) You don   t have to worry about that.  Okay. (Laughs)  50  Wilson  Oltmanns  Well, thank you for visiting with me.  Well, I enjoyed visiting with you. Now I   ve got to go back out there and  go to work because Joe Marcum isn   t there yet.  -------  -------
