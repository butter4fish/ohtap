 Finchum  Murnan  Today is October 12, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re doing an oral history  project centered around Cooperative Extension. Today I   m in  Pawhuska, Oklahoma, to talk with Harold Murnan. He was in  Cooperative Extension for thirty years, from 1951 to 1981. Thank you  for having me today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s have you tell us where you were born and we   ll talk about your  childhood. Then we   ll work our way forward.  Okay, glad to have you, Tanya. Actually, I was born in Noble,  Oklahoma, out there on a farm. At that time, we were born right out in  the country. Anyway, at Noble, I attended a little country school there at  Canada, just south of Noble, and attended high school at Noble.  Following that, I went into service in the Navy in WWII. After that, I  went back to Oklahoma State University, and eventually back into  Extension.  Well, let   s back up a little bit. Did you grow up on a farm?  Oh, yes.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  There were seven of us children, five boys and two sisters.  What were some of your chores?  We milked quite a bunch of cows. We had hogs, sheep, horses, and  mules. We did everything. We had no tractor or anything back there  5  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  when I was just a youngster. You did everything on the farm. You did it  all.  Did you have to kill a few chickens?  Definitely killed a few chickens.  Did you have a method?  We twisted their neck off, I suppose. (Laughs)  Everyone does it a little different. What year did you graduate high  school?     43.  And were you in 4-H?  I was never in 4-H. I was in FFA all through high school. We had no 4-  H in our grade school.  Did the county agent come out to your farm?  Oh, rarely, if ever. I don   t ever remember him coming out there.  When you were in high school, did you think about being an Extension  agent?  When I was in high school, primarily, I was thinking about the war I was  going to go into. After I got into college is when I began to look at both  vo ag teaching and Extension, and decided I would rather go with  Extension, which is a broader field.  What year did you enter Oklahoma A M?  In January 1, 1947. I would   ve entered earlier, but I couldn   t get a room.  I couldn   t find a place to live. We had to wait until the midterm before  we got a little trailer to live in out in Vet Village.  Did they have the GI Bill then?  That was the GI Bill that I was on.  And then you graduated four years later?  No, I graduated exactly three years later in January 1950.  6  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Carried a heavy load, or took some summer courses?  Both. Went to summer school a couple of summers, and went to one  August intersession. That was enough. (Laughter) It comes pretty fast to  you in August.  So, once you got to campus, where did you live?  Well, I lived out at Vet Village. At that time, there was a bunch of trailer  houses in the Village, out back north of the horse barns. That   s where we  lived for the three years we were there.  What was that like?  Well, it was wonderful. We had a place to live. (Laughs) And when  you   d been living in a tent, hey, that   s a step up, because we lived in the  tents or on ships when we were in the Navy. So, we had no complaints  about it.  Not even in the winter?  Everyone else was in the same boat, so you really didn   t complain.  There wasn   t a whole lot of need to complain because all of your  neighbors were doing exactly what you were doing.  Did you have to work some, too?  I didn   t work during the time I was in college, no. My wife did. She  worked at the Bell Telephone office. So, between us, that   s the way we  made it through.  Did you meet her there, or before you got there?  Oh, no. We went to high school together, and then were married right  after I got out of the service.  Things just came speeding along, I guess. Once you were at Oklahoma  A M, what did you major in?  Animal husbandry is what I got my BS  Bachelors of Science  degree in.  Then in Rural Adult Education, I believe, is what the master   s was in.  When did you get that?  I completed that in, I believe, it was    63.  7  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  It was OSU at that point.  Yes. The first degree was at A M, and the second one was at OSU.  And then your first job out of college?  I taught a veteran   s class at Salina, Oklahoma, for the first year and four  or five months. I had applied for Extension when I got out of college,  but there just wasn   t a whole lot available. But then later, when I went  back in, I knew of an opening in Mayes County. I went in to apply for it,  and they said no, they wanted me to go to Pawnee County. I went by  Pawnee and went into Pawnee County.  And that was your first county?  That was my first county.  What was your title at that point?  4-H agent.  Do you remember your first home visit?  No, I don   t remember my first home visit. (Laughs) I remember my first  agent to work with was Mr. A. R. Garlington, a wonderful man. In my  opinion, one of the smartest men that I   ve ever known.  He kind of showed you the ropes?  He showed me a whole bunch of ropes. He was a wonderful fellow, and  a wonderful guy to work with. Wonderful. Just a brilliant man. He really  was.  Where was your office at that time?  We were in the basement of the courthouse.  Was there just one office for that county?  For the county? Yes, we had the agent. There were two men. When I  went there, there were two women. There was a home economist and the  assistant home economist. But by the time I left, they were down to just  the three of us: the agent, me, and the home economist.  And when was that, when you left?  8  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  I left there in    55.  To come here?  No. Gosh, no.  Okay, let   s have you take us through your career.  I left there and went to Muskogee, where I worked in kind of a rural  development program, where you work individually with twenty to  twenty-five farmers. You work real close with them, doing farm  planning with them, income tax, all the way through. That was a real  good program for those individuals, at that time.  That was at the time when they were making the farmers eligible for  social security for the first time. They didn   t understand that for those  two years,    55 and    56, they needed to jump their income as much as  they could. That means you   ve got to pay income tax on it. And if  you   ve spent a lifetime reporting your income, keeping it down so you  don   t pay income tax    But on that, they had to understand that they   ve  got to pay income tax on it. You   re setting the level that you   re going to  draw income for the rest of your life. I could see where I could really  help, and I did help.  In fact, one fellow   and I can   t think of his name now   I helped him.  He sold everything that he could sell that second year, and got his  income up. Then we took his books into the social security office and  applied for his social security. The lady that ran the social security  office, I knew her, I was in church with her, and she kept telling me to  be quiet, let him do the talking. I said,    I figure his books, I know his  books, and I   m not going to let him give you a wrong answer.    So, she  finally just gave up and when we got through, she told him how much  he   d get for the first six months (which, the first six months was back  pay) and then how much he   d get every month for the rest of his life. As  we were walking back to the courthouse, he said,    Harold, was that all  legal?    (Laughs)Which it was, but he just couldn   t believe that he was  going to get that kind of social security payment. So, that program was  really good. I enjoyed doing the work for that bunch. They were  thankful.  You did that for about two years?  No, did that for about four years. And then I went on to Wilburton in     59, as county agent, agriculture agent. It was a completely different  situation. Latimer County is an extremely poor county. It   s forestry. You  9  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  go from agriculture and livestock to forestry and livestock, for the most  part. There is very little farming done there, in Latimer County. So,  you   re dealing with a different set of people, and it   s open range. So, it  was sure enough different. Then after being there, I left in    63, in  December of    63, and that   s when I moved in here to Osage County.  And this is the biggest county in the state, I understand?  It is by far the biggest county in the state.  Did it have just the one office, then?  No, at that time we had three offices. There was one office here, and  then there was one 4-H agent,  Guy Beard  was located at Hominy.   Steve Dowel  was the 4-H agent over at Fairfax. After about one or two  years, they cut it down to just the one 4-H agent, and then they closed  the other two offices down.  And where was your office located?  The first office I had here was in the courthouse, but they ran out of  room, as most courts do, and the commissioner said,    We   ve got to  move you out,    which they did. They still furnished us an office, but  they moved us out of our office and moved us downtown, where the  office is still in the same building. But they   ve moved it since I was out,  and it   s now up on the second floor.  So, from Noble County to Osage County   that   s a little bit of a  difference.  No, not Noble County.  Where you grew up?  Noble.  Oh, different county.  That   s Cleveland County.  Cleveland is around where OU is, right?  That   s right.  Okay. Get my places right. Noble County and then Noble the town.  10  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Noble the town is in Cleveland County.  And that   s still a ways from there, then, to here.  Oh, it   s quite a ways.  For each one of these jobs changes, did you choose to do it for a pay  raise, or just a different challenge?  Well, that   s about the only way you got a pay raise was to move. We did  get small raises, occasionally. We usually got a raise that was more or  less in line with what they were having to pay new agents way back  there. There weren   t a whole lot of raises, but yes, there was usually a  raise if they asked you to take on more responsibilities.  As a young agent, did you have trouble getting people to trust you, or  work with you, or ask you questions, or that sort of thing?  No, not really. Of course, when I was a young agent, I was working 4-H.  In the first place, when you   ve been in the military and you   re a little bit  older than most of the   not at that time. Practically everyone in  Extension, at the time I went in, had been in the military, an awful lot of  the fellows. Either that, or they were sure enough older agents, like Mr.  Garlington. I never had that feeling. They usually appreciated the fact  that you were willing to help.  Osage has a large Indian population. Did you have to do any specific  work with them?  They   re just people. I had lots of tours. Our business here, in Osage  County, is beef cattle. We had lots of tours here from other states that  came through. I know one year, we were at a rancher   s place, and he had  been talking to this group for an hour. One of the fellows asked me,     Are we going to see any Indians on this tour?    I said,    The fellow  you   re at right now, Bill Barnett, is Osage Indian himself. You   re talking  to one.    He said,    Oh     He just couldn   t believe it. But no, the Indian  ranchers and so forth, they were just ranchers. There   s no particular  difference.  Describe a typical day for you, once you got to this county, if there was  a typical day.  This county, as I said, is a beef cattle county. At the time I come in here,  beef performance testing was a big thing. There were lots of the ranches  that did weighing, where I went out with portable scales and weighed  their calves and graded them for them, and scored them, which was a  11  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  grade. I did that an awful lot here, in this county. More so than any other  county I had been in. There was always some in the other counties, but  nothing like there was here in this county.  The other thing that was drastically different in this county is the cattle  tours. There are lots and lots of tours from other states. Even Oklahoma  State University was always calling up,    We   ve got a group here from  somewhere. We   d like for you to pick them up and line them up a tour.     So, lots of tours. Of course, you were also with the local individuals. The  beef cattle business is the main industry for sure, here in Osage County.  Still is?  It still is.  During the time that you were here, did it change much?  The beef cattle business did change, yes. We had the Charlets, the  Simmentals, and all of the other imported breeds that came in and  became more and more of a factor. At the time I came here, practically  everyone had Hereford cattle with a few outstanding Angus, like  Barnetts and Kobes and a few others, but for the most part it was  Herefords. By the time I left, cross breeding had become much more of a  factor. Also, there were getting to be more and more steer operations and  less and less cow/calf operations. So, there was change, continually.  Did you have a routine where you would meet all the farmers at a caf    for breakfast or anything like that?  Well, in this county it would   ve taken a big caf  . You couldn   t do much  of that. You did do similar to that, at all the cattlemen   s conventions, and  the cattlemen   s convention in this county was big. It had been set up  way back in the days of Fred Ahrberg and A.A. Sewell. My predecessors  had set this up. My case was just a simple follow up and to keep doing  what they   d been doing.  That was an unusual program, in that they invited in the feedlots from up  in Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota and anywhere else. Anyone  that had a feedlot would come in here on the cattle tour. That   s what  they had their cattle tour for, was to show the different feedlot operators  what was for market. That was the way they marketed. There were lots  and lots of cattle sales during that cattlemen   s convention, a lot of  speakers, and it was a lot of program. It was a tremendous program and  still is to this day. But there   s probably not as much marketing actually  done during the time as there was way back there.  12  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Did the means of transportation for the cattle change very much?  That change took place following WWII. In WWII, the Chapman-  Barnard Ranch   which is now a big part of the Wildlife Nature  Conservancy   they claimed they had more cattle shipped in and out  than any other point in the United States because the Texas cattle steers  were shipped up here and put on that ranch. Then, they were gathered  back in the fall and sent on to feedlots in Kansas City, and you name it,  different feedlots everywhere. Well, of course, after WWII, we did  completely away with the railroad. Right after I came in here, they   d  gone to truckers. So, the truckers have taken over and wiped out the  railroads. At one time, there were a lot of railroads across Osage County,  here. Big pens would be built along the railroads with scales and such,  where they could ship out and sell their cattle on rail.  That   s a big change.  Yes, it is. Big change from what it is now.  And I   m sure the price of cattle, too, has changed.  Well, the price of cattle goes up and down, regardless. That   s based on  numbers and a lot of other factors. We couldn   t do much about that.  There wasn   t much we could do about the price. (Laughs) You just have  to make the best of what you have.  Were you in charge of arranging the county fair?  Yes. The county fair and the Junior Livestock Show are still pretty big  events, especially this Junior Livestock Show. We were the only county  in the state that had no FFA clubs. This is strictly a 4-H county, and was,  but now there is 4-H and FFA at Skiatook and also, even here at  Pawhuska, though it   s not a big one. But the 4-H Junior Livestock Show  was a tremendous event. We used to sell fifty steers, seventy-five hogs,  and about fifty lambs at every Junior Livestock Show in the spring,  which was big. The people from all over the county, including Tulsa and  Ponca City, did support their clubs. This county is unique, in that part of  Tulsa sits in Osage County. Ponca City   s just across the river from  Osage County, and even Bartlesville butts right up next to it. So, those  places did come through and help support the youngsters from their area.  So, it was a big event and still is to this day.  So, that   s in the spring, and then the county fair is in the fall?  Yes, the fair is in the fall.  13  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Has the fair changed much?  Yes. I was just out there. I think the main thing that has changed is  that   and I haven   t talked to them   but I   ve got a feeling their 4-H  numbers could possibly be suffering a little bit from what they were  back there. Used to, we had a lot of rural schools. The rural schools have  just about gone out. There   s one over by Ponca City, used to be one at  Ponca City, and one over close to Bartlesville, and one or two down  around Sand Springs, Prue, and Osage. I think most of those have just  about gone under. There are a lot fewer schools to have the 4-H club  program.  In the sixties and seventies they were alive and well?  Yes. We had lots of them in big numbers.  Did you work very much with the home demonstration agent?  Well, sure. You always worked with the home agent. Violet Keen was  the one that was here most of the time, practically all of the time that I  was here. Violet was a real congenial gal to work with. Her husband was  also the superintendent of schools down at Barnsdall, and was a 4-H  leader himself. So, they were real nice folks.  In a year   s time, do you have any idea how many miles you might   ve put  on your car?  Well, back then I could   ve told you. That   s been too many years back.  I   d have no idea now.  Quite a few, though, I would think.  Quite a few, yes. This is a big county. You go lots and lots of miles.  Traded your truck every two or three years?  Yes, about like that.  Or did the county supply you with one?  No, no, no. The county never supplied us with anything. Not with pick-ups,  anyway. Not with cars. No transportation. You furnished your own.  But you went somewhere almost every day?  Oh, occasionally you might be in the office, some kind of bookwork or  14  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  something that you had to do, but yes, for the most part, you were out  somewhere going all the time.  Speaking of book work, did you have to do the old narratives? Was that  before or after?  Yes, we did. We always had to make that annual report.  Was it just numbers, or you actually had to have some text to go along  with it?  Oh, you had to report everything. I don   t know. It was a pain that I don   t  think anyone loved to do, but we had to do it. So, we did it.  And those were kept at the county level, or did they go on to the state?  No, no, no. Those all went into the state office. So if there   s any record,  if they   re kept, they   re kept there.  Would they have also gone on to the federal, or did it stop at the state?  I have no idea. After I put them in the mail to the state office, what they  did with them I never followed up.  So, the state office was OSU, or was it in Oklahoma City?  No, it   s Oklahoma State University, in Stillwater.  At some point, the county directors were sent out in the regions, too,  right? Or is it the other way around? When J.C. Evans came, he made  some changes as to organization     Well, at the time I went in, there were four districts. And then when J.C.  came in, it could   ve been him that we split to five districts. We had a  central district, and then the east, and the other four. But we did have the  central district. Osage County was part of the central district, in fact.  And you would have to go to campus some for refreshing or learning  things?  Every year, you went into the Stillwater office. You went into Stillwater  for an annual conference. That was an annual thing, and you could have  district meetings, yes. Every district had meetings at different places.  And were you involved at the national level?  15  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Very little. I never held any national offices or anything like that.  Did it all to keep up with this big county, huh?  Yes. (Laughs)  What was your favorite part of the job?  I don   t know, just working with people. I liked people, and I liked  working with people.  Well, then, the flip side of that, the least favorite?  Making reports. (Laughter) That I know. Yes.  Do you remember the hiring process that you went through when you  were first hired?  Yes, I do. As I said, I went in, I was teaching veterans over at Salina.  The Mayes County job opened, and I went in. But before that, I   d even  contacted them. At any rate, when I was hired, I went over there asking  them for that job. I wanted to apply for it. They said,    It   s filled, but  would you go back by Pawnee County and visit with Mr. Garlington?    I  went back and visited with Mr. Garlington, and as I said, it was the best  move that I ever made in my life because he was a brilliant man.  Did you have to go through several interviews, like with the  commissioners and all of that? Or just with him?  I think all I did when I was hired was just go visit with Mr. Garlington.  And he may have taken me up to the county commissioners, but that was  just a formality. I don   t remember one of them ever asking a question,  because if Mr. Garlington said,    Okay, hire him,    he called back and  talked to them, and I was hired before I got back home to Salina.  Before you even discussed it with the spouse?  I had the spouse with me. I wouldn   t ever do anything without the  spouse. (Laughter)  Okay, just checking. And did she work? When she moved to the different  counties, would she work?  She worked every day because we had four kids. (Laughs)  Okay. I was just trying to see if she had a job that would balance with  16  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  your job, time-wise and all that.  No, she didn   t have a job until after we got here, and the kids were all in  school and everything. Then she was the tag agent. She worked first for  a monument dealer here, and then later was the tag agent. She was the  tag agent for several years.  With your long hours you need someone to hold down the fort.  She just accepted the fact that that I was going to have a lot of night  meetings. I always had them. I mean, that was just part of the job.  What are a couple of the characteristics of a good county agent?  Well, someone that   s willing to work, willing to listen to people. You   re  going to have to continue to study. You   ve got to like people and be  willing to go at night.  Have a good sense of humor?  That doesn   t hurt. That doesn   t hurt. Sure doesn   t.  Any regrets for having chosen this path?  You mean regrets from being in Extension? No way. I don   t have any at  all. I enjoyed my years in Extension. Following my years in Extension,  you   ll see I ended up being County Commissioner for four years. After  that second year, I told them, I said,    You get somebody else. I don   t  want this job anymore,    because I enjoyed working for Extension where  you never told people no. You might say,    I don   t know, but I   ll find  out,    and you had Oklahoma State University backing you up. When  you   re a County Commissioner, you have to tell people,    No,    just  simply because it   s against the law. I don   t care how many others have  done it before. They had sent someone to the pen. That was the reason I  went in there in the first place. So, that was the one thing I enjoyed about  Extension. You said,    I don   t know.    And you don   t want to tell  somebody you do if you don   t, for crying out loud  But you always tried  to help them. Other jobs, it just has to be    no    sometimes, because you  can   t help them.  Would you have phone calls at night with questions?  Still have phone calls at night. After twenty years, I still get calls from  people that  have questions .  What are a few examples of the questions?  17  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Well, mainly for the past ten or fifteen years, especially, it   s,    What kind  of insecticide do I use on    I   ve got bug problems,    in gardens, in  pecans. Especially in pecans. They still call me about pecans.    When do  I spray? What do I spray with?    I tell them they need to go to their  Extension agent, because the insecticides have changed. I say,    Now, I   ll  tell you what I   m going to use, but if you go on down there, they might  tell you something different.    They don   t usually. They just call back  every year. I still get calls wanting me to come and graft their pecan  trees. I still do it.  That leads us to the next question. In tools of the trade, if you   re  grafting, what would you need?  Well, I   ve got a little kit out there that you   ve got to have a saw, and a  knife, and you   ve got to have your sealer that you   re going to seal with,  and rubber bands, string. There are a whole bunch of things. You   ve got  to have graft wood. That   s the main thing. You   ve got to cut your graft  wood. Back there in the last part of February is when I cut mine, and  store it, and have it on hand.  So, when you drive across the county, you can say,    This is my tree.     Yes, I could. (Laughter) There are a lot of them out there. There are a lot  of people, and that   s what I always told them,    I don   t go graft trees. I   ll  go teach you how.    Some of them, if they   ve just got one tree, they   ve  got you hooked. They   ll say,    Yes, I want to know how.    But if they   ve  just got one tree, you   re grafting it whether they are going    But a lot of  them do. Lots of them go on and do their own grafting, which is what I  want them to do.  Do they share some of their nuts later?  I   ve always had pecans trees in my yard, and     So, you don   t need them.  They would, yes. I   ve had one out here that I help him take care of his  trees, and the way I helped him take care of them, I bought the  insecticide, and we did share his pecan crop.  How do you keep up-to-date with these things? Do you call your county  agent?  I do. I definitely do. I go down and I have friends that call me about  stuff. I can   t get them to go down there, so I   ll go down for them and get  18  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  different stuff on their handle, fungicides on grapes, and I know the  insecticides. Fungicides and insecticides on all of these plants you have  to stay up on because, you know, I can   t help it. They   re going to still  call me. So, I do try to stay up on those. Not for a lot of people, but for a  few of my friends, at least.  Have you been asked a question or two that   s kind of crazy? You know,  where did they ever come up with a question like that?  You get lots of crazy questions, but they   re not crazy to the individuals  that are asking them. So, you   ve got to be careful. You don   t make fun  of them for asking such a stupid thing, and you try to give them a  consoling answer.  You mentioned you had children. Were they involved with 4-H?  I didn   t let any of my children get too involved with 4-H, because I  didn   t think that was fair to the other youngsters. I never let them have  any livestock. I   d let one or two of them take part in judging teams  because they   d have to go through a contest and score just like the other  kids. I did let them have bees, because none of the other kids in the  county had bees. So, we did have bees that the kids helped me take care  of, but that   s about it. I encouraged some of them to take part in Boy  Scouts and what have you, but very little activity on their part.  Had they wanted to, though? Or were they happy doing what you   re  doing?  By being active in sports like all of them were, they were pretty well  content. I just explained to them, I said,    There   s no way that I can let  you have a sheep or a pig or a steer, because if you didn   t win, they   d  say    Look there, he can   t even do his own,    and if you do win, then  they   ll say,    He   s spending all his time taking care of his own.       So, it   s  a no-win proposition as far as I was concerned, trying to let your own  kids be too active. So, other than some on judging teams, especially if I  couldn   t get a whole bunch of other kids out, I would let them come out  and help me out.  Did you have a farm then, or were you in this house?  I   ve lived in this house for   it will soon be forty-seven years.  So, if they   d had livestock, you would   ve had to have it somewhere     That   s right. I would   ve had to have made arrangements. Well, they  weren   t going to have. I knew they weren   t going to have. If we were  19  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  going to have a livestock project, then I would   ve had to have changed  houses.  Were the bees here?  No. The bees were out in the country.  You mentioned something about judging grass?  Native grass.  Native grass. Tell us a little bit about that.  Well, mainly it consists of the youngsters learning to identify  grasses .  When I was in Pawnee County, when I first started in Extension, I  collected I think something like seventy-five or eighty plants. I had them  on the wall in the Extension office. Those kids, I worked with them, and  they could identify those plants. And that   s what you have to learn to do.  But the thing about it is they have to learn to identify them in the winter.  So, you   re identifying grass and stuff, not when it   s green and growing,  but from the seed head, type of seed heads, and so forth. But that   s a big  thing for any kid in pasture and range and judging, is to know the weeds.  Not just the good grasses, but you   ve got to know the invader-type  grasses, the weeds, and so forth, that is going to encroach if you over-graze.  So, you learn the condition of the pasture.  You must have been a good teacher, one of your teams won national.  The team at Pawnee won the first National Pasture and Range Judging  Team. And then I had a team or two here from Osage County and the 4-  H agents weren   t teaching it. I said,    Well, okay. Since I haven   t taught  it, I   ll go ahead and teach some of the kids.    And I did teach some of the  kids here. I think our team here came in second in National. They didn   t  win it because I didn   t have enough time to spend with them to work  with them like I did at Pawnee.  Would they have to go somewhere to compete?  The national contest is always at Oklahoma City.  Not too far, then.  No. No, no we were fortunate here.  When you went into Extension county agents, their position, were held in  high prestige in the county?  20  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  In so far as agriculture was concerned, yes, I think so. I always felt like  it was.  And do you think that has changed some?  Not that I know of. I think everyone still looks favorably on Extension  because we   re not just one individual there. That   s the thing that you  have to get across to people. You represent Oklahoma State University,  and if you don   t know the answer to it, there   s somebody there that does,  and they   re a telephone call away. Of course, now, they   re a computer  away. Which has come on after I left, the big push on computers. I   m  surprised when I go down there and tell them what I want, and gosh,  they get on that computer and they   ve got a Sear   s and Roebuck  catalogue for you in just a little bit. (Laughs) No, the information they  can put out.  So, in your day, it was flipping through fact sheets or     Yes, we had fact sheets. I   ve gone in to get those fact sheets, and I found  out, no, you get a whole lot more now than just the fact sheet. They put  out good information, and still do.  Do you have a couple of highlights? Memorable moments that really  stick out?  Oh, I can   t think of anything just in particular. Every county that you go  into   as my son and I were at Wilburton, and when they were calling to  ask me to come up here and check on Osage County, we happened to be  out that night. He was the one that took the telephone call from  Stillwater. Anyway, he told them, he said,    Well, I know what that is.  They   re going to want him to move.    He said,    Every time we get a call  like that, they want him to move.    Well, that wasn   t so, but he guessed it  right that time. But the younger three, they didn   t want to move. He said,     It won   t make any difference. You   ll find new friends wherever you  go.    And that   s the thing about Extension, that I   ve never went into a  county that I didn   t find wonderful friends. The people that you meet  and work with, I think, are just outstanding.  You build a good network that sticks with you.  Yes. You sure do.  Some good friendships formed.  Lots of deep, deep friendships.  21  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  So if they don   t call on you, asking you to move, you weren   t looking to  move, necessarily?  I wouldn   t say that I wasn   t. When I had the opportunity to come back to  Osage County   which I   d started in Pawnee County, and I   d worked  with the two agents up here real close. This was the biggest livestock  county in the world, and that   s what my degree was in. That was quite  an honor, and I jumped at that, yes.  So, it was your goal, if you had one, to end up back here?  I hadn   t thought about it in terms of that. Any time you   ve got a chance  to move into one of the real good counties, and Osage County was one  of the good counties. I was later asked to leave here and go back to  Muskogee County, and I said,    No. I   d prefer not to.     So, they let you say no?  They did. They did let me say no. They didn   t tell me they were going to  fire me if I didn   t go. (Laughs) But I said no. Muskogee County is a  wonderful county, and it   s a nice town to live in. But it   s not the beef  cattle county that Osage County is.  Well, thirty years, you would   ve still been young at that time.  At the time they asked me that, yes. I probably still had about ten years  left in Extension.  Have any of your 4-H students gone on to be county agents themselves?  Yes. Mr. Sharp, Ronald Joe Sharp, did go into Extension. Maybe some  others, I   m not for sure just how many. But I was only in 4-H there for  that one five year stretch when I first started, never in for a lot of years.  But there   s been some.  You were talking about highlights. I know one time I worked with a  fellow when I was doing the farm management work in Muskogee. He  told me, he said,    I want you to come out and go over my plan.    I spent  two days going over his farm plan. He couldn   t expand. He had no land  to expand, and he needed to get bigger, and he said,    Well, that   s what I  thought.    He said,    I can   t expand,    because of ranches around him. He  said,    I   m going to sell out.    Two days later he sold out, and went with  Sears as a manager of a big store for them. So, sometimes you work  yourself right out of a job. (Laughs) No, it helped him answer a problem  that he wanted answered.  22  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  So, listening is important.  Yes.  When you would have someone new come into a position in this county,  did you have a certain way you would train them or initiate them?  No. You might take them up to meet the county commissioners. That  would be kind of a courtesy thing in this county, because they would  kind of expect it. No, you   re just going to know that any agent that  comes in has a farm background, and he knows what   s going on out on  the farm. Most of them have been 4-H club kids, so they know kind of  what they   re expected to do when they go out to meet with those 4-H  clubs. No, just try to make them feel comfortable, and let them know  that you   re there to help them, if they do need help.  Can you say the same thing about specialists that come in?  I always got along real good with my specialists. We had a whole lot  fewer specialists way back there than what they do now. But there were  people like Eddie Whitehead. Anything dealing with gardening and  horticulture, he took care of all of it. When he retired, it was kind of  funny. They hired three doctors to take his place. They hired one to take  care of gardens, one to take care of pecans, and one to take care of just  regular garden stuff. When you don   t have the answer to something, you  appreciate that specialist and the fact that they   ll help you dig up the  right answer.  I had one in particular in mind. He told me to ask you that question  because you were real nice with him, he said, when he was a greenhorn.  Ladd.  Ladd Hudgins?  Yes.  Ladd was a real good young man. Yes, I remember Ladd when he came  here. He was doing income tax and starting the computers with the folks,  and he kept after me. He really wanted three or so at each county, but he  wanted me to invite six. I said,    Ladd, if I invite six, and they all agree  to go, are you going to take them?    Well, he said,    They just won   t all  go.    I said,    Ladd, that   s not what I said. If I invite six, and they all want  to go, are you going to take them?    He finally said yes, he would. I  invited six, and all of them went, too. I knew the people well enough that  I invited six, and they represented the whole county. He was surprised  23  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  that they all went, but they did. They took his program and really  appreciated the work Ladd did. Ladd was a real nice guy.  He said to say hello.  Well good. I enjoyed working with Ladd.  I   ve got various people telling me stories about you.  Oh  Sorry about that. (Laughs)  Did you have any other mentors besides the one that you mentioned  when you first started in Pawnee County?  I enjoyed working with Bill Cook when I went to Muskogee County.  Bill was a whole lot more into civic things and so forth, but you had to  be in Muskogee. Following Bill, when he left there, Bill Parham came  in. Bill was another wonderful guy. Both of them were real good agents  to work with and just wonderful people, and so were the women agents.  Cleo Stiles Bryan was in Muskogee for a little while. Does that name  ring a bell?  That rings a little bit of a bell, yes.  She wasn   t there for a long time, I don   t think, but for a little while.  But I knew of her. She wasn   t there for a long time while I was there.  Did you have to do radio and newspaper articles, that type of thing?  Sure, you had to. But that was no challenge at all compared to doing the  TV.  You had to do TV?  We had Channel 8 at that time. It was out of Muskogee. We had a  weekly program on Saturday mornings. At the time I went there, Bill  Cook would have me on, say, once a month or something. In other  words, he   d say,    It   s your program. You take it this week.    But then I  was there when he left and Bill Parham got there. So, there was about a  month there that I had that TV program every week for thirty minutes.  We did agriculture, we did the weather, we did the whole ball of wax.  Live?  24  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Yes.  You had to rehearse a little bit, then, huh? (Laughs)  No, there was no such thing as rehearsal. (Laughter) You just turned the  TV on, and that was it.  Did you do that same thing here in this county?  No.  Just Muskogee?  No, no TV. That   s the only one where we had a TV program. But we did  it there.  Had to get up early to do it?  Oh, it doesn   t seem like it was early. Eight thirty, nine o   clock,  something like that on Saturday morning.  Was the county fair a little bit different there than it was here?  In Muskogee, you not only had a county fair, you had a state fair there.  It was a big deal. It was quite a fair.  Lots of chickens?  Well, no. There were not a lot of chickens. There were chickens, now.  Every one of the state fairs has chickens. There were the exhibits that  came in from the southeastern part of the state. Every county brought  their exhibits in to Muskogee. You had the three fairs, Muskogee, Tulsa,  and Oklahoma City.  It doesn   t any more, though, does it?  I don   t know. I don   t know whether it does or not.  I know Tulsa does.  Well yes, Tulsa and Oklahoma City. I don   t hear much of Muskogee  anymore. But at that time, it was. Then, they also had a big junior  livestock show, too.  So, you worked in four different counties?  25  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Yes.  Pawnee, Latimer     Pawnee, Muskogee, Latimer, and Osage.  And can you touch on some of the major differences in those four  counties? You mentioned earlier income, or economics was a little  different.  Yes. Pawnee County was a lot of crop land. It was a more diversified  type of agriculture. Muskogee was a fair sized city so, you   ve got a lot  more city problems and so forth, gardens, and lawns. The part I was on,  it didn   t affect it because I was working strictly with individual farmers.  It was a diversified-type farming. The ones I was working with had quite  a bit of farmland, and had several grade-A dairies that I worked with.  When you went to Latimer County, it was a forest. There was a lot of  scenery, hard to make a living out of it sometimes. But open range for  cattle, everybody   s cattle. There was a lot of them that ran out together  there because that was still open range country at that time.  Osage County is different, vastly different than all the others, because  you had less farmland. Although there is a lot of farmland up and down  the county, over in the bend section, there   s real good farmland, and up  and down the rivers there   s farmland. But for the most part, it   s  grassland and beef cattle business is your industry here. That and oil.  So, you could almost narrow how much of the area you needed to keep  up on. I mean, you didn   t have to remember all those things, just mostly  cattle and grass, and then call if you had others. And here your office  was in the courthouse, you said.  The office was in the courthouse until they ran out of room, and then  they moved us downtown to the   I don   t know what they call that old  building, but it was a county owned building.  Over the course of those thirty years, did your job change that much  from start to finish? I mean, I know you were 4-H to county director.  The agriculture changed in each one of the different counties that I was  in. The people are the main thing that you   re working with. I never did  feel like there was much change there.  Teaching.  People are people, and they have problems. They ask, and they   re going  26  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  Murnan  Finchum  to get in touch with you, and want an answer from you. So, it   s a matter  of trying to find answers to their problems.  Is there anything else you want to add before we close out?  Not a thing.  Not a thing?  Tickled to death to have you here.  I think the county and the state was lucky to have you.  Well, I don   t know about that. I was lucky to have Osage County. I was  lucky to be in Extension because I met some wonderful, wonderful  people.  Well, thank you very much for letting me chat with you today.  Well, I   m glad to have you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
