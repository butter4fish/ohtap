 Simpson  Patterson  Today is April 23, 2011. My name is Lynne Simpson and I   m on the  faculty of the Oklahoma State University Library. I   m in Tulsa,  Oklahoma, to interview Mrs. Violet Alford Patterson as part of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program   s Spotlighting Oklahoma  Oral History Project and our topic today is Boley, Oklahoma. Thank you  for inviting me into your home today.  Oh, you   re welcome  Glad to have you.  Well, I have a few questions to ask and the first one would be when and  where were you born?  I was born in rural Clearview, Oklahoma, Okfuskee County, on January  23, 1927.  Would you talk a little bit about your youth and where you grew up?  I grew up in a small community called Little Hill. There were  approximately five to six families in this little community. I went to  elementary school at Little Hill and went there until I was an advanced  eighth grader. At that time we moved to Weleetka, Oklahoma.  Would you describe your family? How many siblings you have and your  extended family there in Okfuskee County?  My mother and father were the parents of fourteen children. I had two  older brothers, in addition to the fourteen making sixteen, that I did not  grow up with. The thirteen of us lived in Little Hill where we all went to  grade school. From time to time, my parents moved about, but lived in  Okfuskee County. I was the twelfth child of my parents, so I was far  down the line. But nonetheless, I remember very vividly when we were  all at home. It was a bit crowded at times but we had fun. We often say  5  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  that we fought for entertainment and that was a part of our growing up.  We would help our mother in the flower yard and she always had  beautiful flowers. We would help her in the garden and we ate  everything that we could get our hands on because being out in the  country, you kind of learned to take advantage of all of the edibles. Our  favorites were tomatoes and okra, collard greens, turnip greens. All of  them made us grow up fast and in fairly good health.  Would you share a little about your educational background and talk  about your college experiences?  Oh, yes. How many do you want me to share?  All that you would like to share.  All right  (Laughs) I went to high school in Clearview, Oklahoma. I just  must share this   at that time, we would ride on a bus from Weleetka to  Clearview. They often laughed about us passing three high schools to go  back to our high school. Now that I think of how short we are on  gasoline, I can see why. I left Clearview High School and attended  Langston University. I was there from 1946 to 1950. We had active, at  that time, about four sororities and four fraternities and we all looked  forward to the times when each of those groups would give their spring  dances. That was a lot of fun. In addition to the frats and sororities, we  had some clubs and they were very, very active. The young women who  did not go through sororities because of maybe grades or whatever, they  joined these clubs and they were very, very viable clubs. They would  have projects that they would do each year and would make them a fun  time.  Great.  I finished at Langston in 1950. I did not finish my master   s degree,  because of marriage and a different job, until 1967, at Oklahoma State  University.  What was your major?  My major was business education and later, I kind of changed it to  business and vocational education.  Who have been your role models and what about them do you admire?  I had role models as far back as grade school. I remember my first role  model in grade school was a lady by the name of Lou Ethel Foshee and I  often think of the things that she introduced us to. She was from Boley,  6  Simpson  Patterson  Oklahoma. She taught us how to take care of our linens, our table linens,  and I remember so vividly that she taught me how to fold a napkin. That  was just a wonderful occasion. My goodness  Is there a certain way that  you fold these napkins? But nonetheless, she had four or five children of  her own and she would drive from her home to the school every day and  I admired her doing that with those children.  In high school, Nannie K. Bethel was the music teacher and I would try  to sing and I wanted to learn to play the piano and she was very helpful.  She was not there but three years, but they were three wonderful years  because we were exposed to operas and plays with a lot of musical  history. She is still living and living in her own home in Lawton,  Oklahoma. Her name is now Nannie Kay Bethel Presley.  In college, my role model was Almeda Combs Parker, a Clearview-ite.  She saw me through my four years. My first year at Langston, we were  all out in the hall the fall of my sophomore year and we were out  visiting, hadn   t seen each other for three months. She walked up to me  and she said,    Alford, do you want a job?    I said,    Oh, yes, yes, I   d love  a job     She said,    Go and talk to Mr. Hebert and tell him I sent you.     That was the beginning of my work experience. By the time I finished as  a senior at Langston, I was making more than it took for my expenses,  thanks to her. She was really a role model. When we went through  Alpha Kappa Alpha, she took us to our first regional conference and of  course, you couldn   t tell any of us that we had not arrived. We were  ready because we had gone to this regional conference. That was the  beginning of my participation with the regional.  Thank you. What was your profession, how did you choose it, and what  types of jobs have you had over the years?  I   ve always stayed in the business area. My first job was at the State  Training School for Negro Boys in Boley, Oklahoma. I started as a  general clerk and I would take shorthand occasionally. I helped to keep  the books and wrote letters. About two years into my employment at  Boley, being a political type of institution, the superintendents changed  and with their change, I changed to chief clerk. I had to do the payroll,  do the budget, process all of the claims, supervise the general clerk who  was in the office with me, and I stayed at that position for ten years. As  it would happen, they added business education to the State Training  School High School and I was able to teach typing. Being a social  studies secondary major, I taught civics, United States history, and I did  that for three years.  I left there in 1967 and I went to Tulsa. I worked as a clerk for North  American Aviation and took shorthand, kept up with the employees     7  Simpson  Patterson  records and other office jobs still in my business capacity. Being on this  job for approximately two years, a friend of mine called me and she said,     Violet, we   re going to add vocational business at Booker T.  Washington High School. Would you be interested in teaching it?    I  said,    By all means     She said,    I thought that would fit your  personality.    (Laughs) She told me what would be involved and how I  would have to go out and meet people and get jobs for these students. To  me that was a challenge and of course, we know how the racial lines  kept students from working for certain companies and I endeavored to  visit those companies and talk with them. Many I was able to change.  They hired our students. I stayed on that job until retiring in 1986. It was  fun. (Laughter)  What is your earliest memory of Boley?  Oh my, gosh  Being a resident of Okfuskee County, we were in all of  the educational meets that were sponsored. So, I started going to Boley  early on. I really could not say whether I was ten, twelve, or whatever.  But there was a vivacious county superintendent for blacks. Her name  was Octavia Douglas. She and others started what they called an  educational meet and at this educational meet, the various grade schools  would send representatives to take tests. Math   all of those subjects that  were being offered   geography, social studies, whatever, and they  would compete on a local level. The schools that were present, everyone  would be pulling to win first place.  In addition to the tests, there were oratorical contests. I remember very  well my sister, Wessylyne, was a tiny, little girl. She was probably eight  years old, maybe more. She learned the poem that one of the larger girls  practiced every evening. She learned it by just sitting there and listening  to her. It started a trend in the county of having young people do what  the eighth graders normally did. And she won   she was good. She  remembered    The Creation.    I shall never forget it.  In addition to the tests and the oratorical contests, they had what was  called Field and Track Day. And there again, all of the elementary  schools in the county would compete. They would broad jump, long  jump, they had sack races   oh, I can   t remember all of the activities, but  it was a fun time because all of the schools would prepare. They would  prepare their students. If some were small, they might bring two or three  contestants, but they were into that activity, whatever it was. It did  something for the schools that was just   it was remarkable the way they  competed against each other and were learning at the same time. So, I  remember that so vividly. I couldn   t wait  Some of the students would  say,    Are you wearing new shoes? Are you wearing a new dress?    That  was a dress up time for us. So, we looked forward to it.  8  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Could you describe your fondest memory of Boley?  I had many fond memories. Do you want one when I was a little girl or a  young lady or working at the State Training School for Boys?  Let   s do all three.  Do all three?  Yes.  All right. I remember going to Boley for a contest. I don   t recall whether  I was taking a math test or spelling. We competed in all those. One of  the young ladies came up to me. She was just a little kid, I imagine nine  or ten years old. She asked me,    What is your name?    She was such a  warm person, I will never forget that. She had some friends. She took  me out on the school grounds and said,    This is my friend,    and she told  me their names and it was just such a warm thing that she did. I shall  never forget that.  In high school, I think the singing activities that we participated in I  remember vividly and most vividly, I remember going to the fairs. They  had fairs there in the fall and that was a big time. We would get on the  Ferris wheel. We did not ride Ferris wheels every day, so that was a  remarkable thing. I remember riding that Ferris wheel and enjoyed it.  So, I looked forward to going to the fairs when my parents would take  me.  Oh, I really wonder what I would like to share first. The people in Boley  were remarkable. I recall that just as soon as I accepted the job in Boley,  I discovered I was pregnant. I had married that spring and I was  pregnant. One of the ladies came and said,    Are you making little feet?     It took me aback, but she was such a darling thing. During the entire  pregnancy, she kept up with my progress, how many pounds I had  gained. It was just a delightful relationship.  I cannot leave Velma Dolphin Ashley out. She was superintendent of  schools at Boley. If I did not enjoy what I had eaten on the campus, I felt  welcome to walk in her kitchen and ask her what she had for supper and  did she have any left? (Laughs) She would proceed to fix my plate and  she would set the plate in front of me and then she would go and get a  big glass of milk and say,    Drink your milk.    I shall never forget that. I  can go on and on with experiences that were warm. My pastor and his  wife were Emily   s first babysitters. I just thought that was so nice of  him. He said,    Oh, my wife will keep your baby. Don   t worry about that.  9  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Go and get your baby and bring her up here,    and they took care of her.  What was your neighborhood like? Did you know your neighbors?  In the rural areas, as I said, there were six, no more than seven families  that were in that neighborhood. I knew all of them and they knew me by  name. It wasn   t    that little girl,    it was Violet. One of the things that I  remember is the neighborhood was mixed and there wasn   t a lot of racial  tension. We all got along very well except maybe a few incidents that  occurred, but normally, they were very, very easy to live with. It was  nothing for my mother to say,    Go to Mrs. Cooper   s and get some milk,     and there was no pay. You just go and you tell her your mother wanted  milk.  Which town are you talking about?  I   m talking about Little Hill now. Now, in Weleetka, when we moved  there, the neighbors all knew each other. Most of us belonged to what  was known as Pilgrims Baptist Church. It   s where I grew up and they  were kind to you. My first experience at a Baptist convention was  because of a pastor and his wife coming from Oklahoma City, picking us  up in Weleetka, driving us back to Oklahoma City so we could attend  the National Congress of Christian Education. I shall never forget that  experience. So, it was warm and of course, when I moved to Boley,  everybody knew everybody and looked out for everybody. One of the  things that I missed when I lived there that I experienced going into  town when I was younger, was the Masonic Lodge. It burned and I  missed that building.  What was the home like that you lived in, in Boley?  I lived in a two-bedroom house, a frame house. The lady who let my  husband and I rent her house worked for the post office. She was the  postmaster   s wife. And the house was neat. She had really taken care of  it and we had one big room that reminds me now of what we called the  den. In that room we had a dining room table and our sofas were in  there. It was just a comfortable little house and we enjoyed it.  Do you remember what your neighbors did for a living and were they all  residents of Boley from childhood?  Most of them. Most of them had grown up. Some had come to Boley to  work at the State Training School and stayed on. I recall that the people  who lived to the right of us, big family, and the mother stayed in the  home, but the father went out and did odd jobs. They had kind of a  scuffle, hard time because there weren   t any jobs in Boley Proper  10  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  besides the training school. If you didn   t work there, at the high school,  or at the grade school   those were the only jobs. Of the shops that were  downtown, usually the owners ran the shops and had no need for  additional help. Sometimes, I remember that he would drive to Okemah.  He would get jobs there and I guess, probably, eight or ten children, but  they made a living for those children and that, generally, was the pattern.  What can you tell me about Cooperative Extension agents and  homemaker clubs, home demonstration educators, 4-H, and how they  impacted life in Boley, Oklahoma?  Not having lived in Boley until I was an adult, they called them home  demonstration clubs and they would meet in various homes. They might  quilt. If you   ve ever seen a quilting frame, they occupy a whole room  and whoever entertained for that particular time, would have to have that  quilt in their home until that quilt was finished. Many quilts were made  and given to people who needed them and they would very often do this.  They also would can during the time of the season for your garden. They  would have canning projects. They would have sewing projects. But this  had kind of ceased at the time that I worked there because of the time.  Many people were leaving Boley and the people just were not in a large  number available for the clubs.  How would you describe Boley now, compared to when you lived in it  before?  Well, Boley is   it doesn   t have the things to offer that it had when I was  there. I recall that there were three places that you could go and order  food, sit down, eat it, and enjoy it. If that   s available now, I   m sure it   s  not over one place where you could order food. The gentlemen who ran  Trulove   s Hamburgers   and I remember him when I used go to the fairs  in Boley. He still lives, but he does not run his shop. I   m eighty-four so,  you can imagine how old he is, but he does encourage people to come to  his home now and he will prepare hamburgers for them to enjoy.  What were some of the major organizations in the town and how did  they contribute to the community?  For one organization were the members of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.  We did not have a chapter in Boley because we went to Okmulgee for  chapter meetings, but very often the AKA   s who were in town, would  sponsor scholarships for young ladies. If a young lady needed money or  a particular thing to participate in some activity, we saw that they got it.  The same thing was true of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. There were quite  a few members there and they would take care of the needs of the young  men. The Ladies Industrial Club was also very helpful. I was never a  11  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  member, but I saw their works and at one time, they had young ladies  that they helped to go to college and would see that they had what they  needed for attending school.  How do you mean,    What they needed?     Money, clothing, maybe a ride to the campus after a holiday. They  would take care of those things.  That   s very cool. Who were some of the town leaders and how did this  group of people determine the kind of community that it was going to  be?  I would say that the town leaders were, at the time I moved there, there  were two doctors; a medical doctor and a dentist. Very often, they would  support various causes. Say, if a family was in need of, maybe, food for  their children, clothing, health needs, they would lead projects. Dr.  Sanders was the medical doctor and he also worked at the State Training  School so, I got to see him very often. It was just a trend that you helped  your neighbors. Another leader, the superintendent of schools, Mr.  Ashley, was superintendent following Mrs. Ashley   s tenure. He had  worked for years as a demonstration agent and knew the families in and  around Boley and knew where he could get help. When things were  presented, he would go to work on it.  The faculty itself, the Boley faculty and this was the elementary and the  secondary faculty, they would take on projects and help families who  were in need. I remember my husband taught there and he and Mrs.  Ashley were co-sponsors of a class. It was nothing for him to say,     We   re going to help this family,    and they would give them financial  help. So, it was a situation where people looked after each other and did  it without complaining. (Laughs)  What was the focal point of the town? Was it sports? Was it  organizations?  Gee, we loved our Boley Bears. Anytime the basketball team was  playing in or out of town, the people went to the school to support them.  Of course, Boley was always interested in their young people attending  college. Our sorority would make sure that the young ladies who stated  that they had a desire to go to school, in some way or another we would  help them to reach that goal. It has been known as a town where the  youngsters went to college. And they didn   t just go. They stayed,  became professionals, and really, really lived up to that reputation.  Do you feel that the children in the town always had a tendency to move  12  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  away to find their fortune?  Well, it was a matter of moving away to be gainfully employed. It  wasn   t that they looked forward to becoming of age so they could leave.  But, if they wanted to raise families and take care of their families and  get in a position to buy homes, they had to leave Boley to find  employment.  Could you walk us through the town and talk about some of the stores or  the Masonic Temple, the bank, and describe those architecturally?  Coming into Boley when I first went there to work, there was a building  and I don   t recall the name of the building. The reason it stays so very  vivid with me is one of my classmates at Langston, who was from  Boley, came back to open a nightclub-type business. I recall that when I  first went to Boley, I didn   t have a car. One night, the bus was very, very  late. I said,    Oh my  How will I get to the campus?    because everything  kind of shuts down when it   s around ten or eleven o   clock and it was  that time when I arrived on the bus.  I looked up and I saw that Bernice   s business was open. I went to the  business and she was sitting outside and she said,    Why are you out this  time of night?    I said,    I   m here to ask you to take me to the campus.     She said,    Were you on that bus?    and I said,    Yes.    She got up, got in  her car, and took me to the campus. That was the spirit that I  experienced. I said,    What do I owe you for leaving your business and  having to get someone else to look out while you were gone?    She said,     You owe me nothing.    She   s deceased now, but I recall that happened.  How far was Boley from the campus?  About a mile, about a mile. It would have been a nice black walk  because it was dark. I mean, pitch dark and I would have had to walk  back up the highway and to the campus. She made sure that I got there  and that I got there safely. Coming in now is Hyde Park Mortuary. A  nice, brick building and still in business. Mr. K.X. Richardson was the  director when I first went to Boley, but his son is the director now. One  business that has been there for a long time, and you just look forward to  it, is Young   s Filling Station. At one time, you could get your car oiled,  you could have tires changed. They were really in business during the  time her husband lived.  On the opposite side of the street was the bank and at one time, a very  impressive building. Of course, that is where the notoriety begun where  Major  H.C.  McCormick was able to stop a bank robbery. Not  altogether stop it, but the main robber, he was able to keep from taking  13  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  all of what Boley had to offer. Going up the street was the hardware  store. At the time I was there, it was known as Meyer   s Hardware Store.  You could go in that store and find anything that you wanted from a  hardware store. There were even times when she stocked small furniture,  saws, hoes, spades, all kinds of stuff, nuts and wrenches and screws,  they had it. You could always stop there and not have to go to Okemah  or to Paden to try to get it. It was right there in that store.  Also in that block, was Tieal   s Ladies Wear and during the Christmas  holidays and the Easter holidays, she would get in a new stock of hats.  Of course, the ladies would go and try on the hats. That was just one of  the main features that I liked about Boley when I first moved there. I  would go there and buy hats. They   ve always been my weakness. Going  up the street on the same side, in the next block was Kees   K-E-E-S. He  would have women   s clothing, men   s clothing, and often you would see  nice looking dresses or suits hanging in his showcase. In addition to that,  he had things such as candy, cookies. Any kind of fruit that you might  want, you could get it at Kees. You could just satisfy most of your  wishes, at the time I started working, in Boley.  What community traditions are celebrated today, as compared to the  ones that were celebrated when you lived there?  One that goes on that is still the largest celebration in Boley, started  while I lived there   the rodeo. It is held during Memorial weekend and  it is something to see how the people who lived in Boley and were  reared in Boley will come back and support that activity. I believe my  nephew told me the other day that there   s someone that they   re  expecting from New York. He   s expected for the rodeo and they will  come and spend the weekend and attend the rodeo.  In addition to that, when I first went there, Boley had a band and we  would go to Bristow every year. They would participate in the Christmas  parade and it was something that we looked forward to because the  Boley band was going and we were there to support them. Anytime there  was a special celebration, the students in the band would don their suits,  get their horns, and with their bandmaster, line the streets of Boley and  participate. Everyone loved the band.  Why do you think the rodeo has remained so important to the  community?  I guess, first of all, we Oklahomans just enjoy rodeos. (Laughs) I know  the same thing is true for Clearview. We know that it is a sport that we  can all get into and we know what   s going on and it   s a fun time. You  can spend your whole evening talking to people, visiting with them, and  14  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  plus, it is a fundraiser, when it   s not raining. (Laughs) It is really a  fundraiser because your customers will fill that arena if the weather is  good and of course, the town prospers because they can use that money  to fund projects that they   ve neglected to do. So, it is financial and it   s  social.  Could you describe the interactions between Boley and the neighboring  towns?  Kind of limited on that because most of the activities that we  participated in we would go to Prague and take part in their parades, but  that was the only relationship we had, same thing with Okemah. When  community events were held, people were invited from the neighboring  towns. They would come and participate and seemingly, would invite  the Boley authorities to do the same thing, but it was just a spasmodic  thing. It wasn   t anything that was ongoing, so there, I would say I   m  limited.  Okay. Could you talk about the role of the boys    home and later the  correctional facility there, in Boley?  Well, for years, the State Training School for Negro Boys, as it was  known, employed the people of Boley and worked with the people of  Boley, and Boley people worked with the school. I remember when I  first went there, the head cook lived in Boley and a couple of her  assistants lived in Boley. On the farm, a lot of the people who aided the  farm superintendent, who was from Boley, at that time, and many of his  helpers   they were from Boley. So, it was been a financial help in  keeping Boley employing people and they could live on at Boley.  What did Boley mean to the black towns in Oklahoma and what  activities were centered there?  Boley was known somewhat as a role model for a black town. They  knew that Boley had an excellent high school. The students were well  educated there and the other towns wanted to have those same offerings.  Many activities were held there. For instance, the field and track meets  were held there because of the facility known as the State Training  School for Negro Boys. They had a lot of space and they had a beautiful  gym and a tennis court and these facilities were already there. So, this is  why the track meets were held in Boley. The educational meets were  held there because of the many classrooms. In addition to the classrooms  on the senior high school side, there was a two-story grade school at the  same time in Boley and they had access to that as well. So, that   s why  the activities were held there.  15  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  What traditions or customs have you made an effort to preserve and why  are those traditions so important to you?  I like the tradition of maintaining friendships and the only way to  maintain this friendship is to stay in touch with the person. I like  meeting people and after I meet them, I want to keep up with them. So, I  think that that   s an excellent way to lay foundations for your generation  and the generations to follow.  What kind of entertainment was there in Boley and was it more family-based  or community-based?  The type of entertainment, as we mentioned, they had the facilities at the  school, they had the band and students would often learn to play various  instruments. That was gratifying for them, during the time that they  weren   t in school. Many of them kept their instruments and they were  able to play during the weekends and whatever. I would say that it was  pretty much community-based. At one time, there were   I can think of  about four grade schools that were in and around Boley. Many times  when they had their activities, they had them at Boley, where they would  have enough room to do the things that they wanted to do.  What types of music were popular over the years?  Gee, I guess about that time it was boogie-woogie. (Laughs) I remember  very well that Hazel Scott was popular and then we went onto the   I   m  getting old and my mind is kind of slow, but help me out here, the group  of people, of men, five men?  Oh, The Temptations?  The Temptations. I couldn   t think of Temptations. They were very  popular and if you went to the dances that   we had dances at that time,  the adults and the young children. We had dances. I remember very well  that we had one at the gymnasium on the campus at State Training  School and for those dances we would have a disc jockey. They would  play the music and we would invite people from Wewoka and Bristow  and Clearview and all of the little towns. Vernon   I remember some  people used to come up from Vernon. We made our own entertainment  and we had our records there and someone to spin them and we had a  good time.  I have a question for you about special food traditions that are held by  your family. How far back can you trace some of those foods?  Back to my mother. In fact, my husband says that he has never tasted an  16  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Finchum  Patterson  Simpson  apple pie like my mother used to cook, me not included, just my mother.  He says she could cook the best apple pie. Of course, she could do fried  pies that would make you slap someone just to get a piece. (Laughs) In  addition to that, I think she could cook the best green beans and fresh  potatoes. It was delightful. In addition to that, she liked making coconut  cake and usually, three tiers was her speed. As large as the family was,  by the time we each got a piece it was gone. So, she would always make  the three tiered cakes. I can go on. Sorghum, molasses cookies, they  were good. They were good.  And where was your mother from?  My mother was from Mississippi, Jackson County, Mississippi.  What family heirlooms or keepsakes do you have and what is their  history?  I have my mother   s rocking chair in my bedroom right now. In addition  to that, I have two flower pots that she loved. I say    pot   , I should   ve  said,    vase.    They were very decorative. My sister, Ione, sent them to  her from Detroit and she loved it. She loved them and I still have them.  Quilts   do you have any? Did they mean anything or are they just  quilts?  My mother usually used a pattern.  Oh, she did? Okay, okay.  Yes, she used the nine patch, the Little Dutch Girl. Did you ever see the  Little Dutch Girl?  Probably.  Some kind of star. I can see the quilt but I can   t think of   ? Wes would  probably remember   some kind of star. I don   t recall. It has just been a  long time that I   ve thought about that. I mentioned the nine patch.  Was there a movie theater in Boley? Do you remember there being one?  I don   t know if they ever had one there. I don   t recall any discussion  about a movie theater. They might have had one. I can remember when  we went to the movies in Weleetka and sat up in The Coup. Do you  remember that?  I just know that Weleetka was the white town and Clearview was the  17  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  black town. And that   s what they called it,    The Coup?     That   s what we called it.  What brought your parents to Oklahoma?  My parents    parents came to the territory because they were looking for  a better way of life. They had been told that there was land available.  There was water and a lot of acreage that could be cultivated. So, they  came here for that reason    to better their family   s status.  Could you talk to us a little more about the quilting tradition that your  mother had?  Yes, I remember so vividly. We would come home from school one day  and the quilting materials would be in the living room and that meant  we   it was a small room   and we would have to go around that quilt  and even though we knew that those quilts were going to keep us nice  and warm, we were always fearful that it would go on for the rest of the  winter. But she made beautiful quilts. It was nothing for us to, maybe,  tear a dress so it couldn   t be darned, so we could wear it again. And she  would say,    Don   t throw that dress away.    She would get that dress and  cut out the pieces that she needed. After she finished with the quilt, we  would stand and I would say,    There   s my dress. Wes, there   s your  dress, Ernestine, there   s your dress.    (Laughter) Because she would use  those pieces that she had cut out in that quilt and she especially did that  with the nine patch.  What world events had the most impact on you when you were growing  up and did any of them personally affect your family?  World events? I can tell you the first thing that I remember about world  events and that was during the years before the First World War, when  Mussolini and Hitler were just destroying cities and countries. When  they went into Africa and so many people   s lives were lost and I  wondered,    Why do you have to have wars?    knowing that I had some  brothers who would probably have to serve if it ever affected us. Of  course, the people were saying,    Well, we   re going to be drawn into it,  too,    and we were. So, that is the first world event that had an impact. I  loved President Roosevelt. I thought he was a wonderful president and  tried to keep up with everything that he did. He was always involved in  world events. He instituted the fireside chat and I would try to listen to  each fireside chat. There, I became conscious of the world.  Was your family impacted by that war?  18  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Yes. (Laughs) This isn   t funny, but it does have a funny ending. Romeo,  my brother who is just two years older that I, put his age up so he could  go to the army. We weren   t in war at that time. He was inducted and he  was at Fort Sill in training when the war was declared December 7,  1941. He said that he cried himself to sleep every night. He was only  sixteen, but he put his age up so he could go. So, that had an impact on  me.  What do you see as the impact of segregation or integration on the town  of Boley?  Well, it seems as though in just talking to the people there and listening  to them discuss various things, they felt like they had been left out on a  lot of issues. When grants were made to cities to improve this and  improve on the other thing, they felt that they were not equally  considered. They felt that was one of the things that kept them from  advancing.  How did you learn about the Tulsa race riot and did you learn about it  in school or is it something that you learned about at home?  I   ve heard about the race riot from about any angle you can come up  with, just any angle. If you say,    Did you read about it? Did someone  tell you about it? Did you talk to anyone who was actively involved?     All of those, I would say,    Yes, yes.    (Laughter) I recall that we had  some cousins that were living here at the time. You   ve heard us talk  about Uncle Fate   his two daughters were living here at the time. Later  on, when they moved to Detroit, the discussion came up and I asked  someone, I said,    Well, why did they leave Tulsa?    They said,    The race  riot     So, I proceeded to talk to them about the race riot next time I saw  them. They were just so mortified, horrified, just anything you can think  of. They couldn   t wait to get out of this town.  What was taught about Boley history, where you went to school or even  at the schools where you taught?  Boley was a part of negro history just like you might talk about the life  of Marian Anderson or you might talk about   I   m trying to think, my  mind fails me   the dancer who helped Shirley Temple. They called him  Bojangles. It was just like they were mentioned in history, so was Boley.  Of course, many of the things that they talked about, some I had  witnessed, some I had not. But I do remember when there was a robbery  in Boley. My mother had gone to Okemah to do some shopping and she  said that she came down the street and there was a white man stretched   Gestures laid out flat  and of course, the lawman   one was at the foot,  one was at the head. They put him on display and she just happened to  19  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  have been there and got to see him. They kept him on display until that  evening.  So, was that one of Pretty Boy Floyd   s gang members or someone else?  I don   t think they were conspirators. I don   t think, but I don   t know.  This was Birdwell. Birdwell was his name. The black man who was  killed with Birdwell, his name was Glass. His family was from  Shawnee. They were both just there like,    Here they are.    My mother  came back and I think it kind of upset her for about two or three days.  She was just jittery.  What was the town   s reaction to the assassinations of Martin Luther  King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy and did the churches do anything  special?  During both of those I was here in Tulsa and it was such a shock for us  to hear about John F. Kennedy. I never shall forget I was working at  North American Aviation and they were talking about it on the radio and  whatever, and we all stopped work to hear what was going on. But the  thing that I remember most about that wasn   t what they said on the TV  and radio, it was what one of my white coworkers said. A man came in  the office and said,    Well, they just took John Kennedy to the hospital.  He   s been shot,    and the lady turned around and said,    Good. Is he  dead?    I should never forget that, never in my life. That she viewed it  that way. After she realized what she   d said and some of the others said,     You need to apologize.    She finally got around to apologizing, but that  was the worst part of it.  When Martin Luther King was killed, we were just stunned. We just  didn   t expect that and knew, too, the kind of activities that he  participated in that this could happen, but didn   t think it would. We now  have a Martin Luther King Day and there   s a big parade and it seems to  get bigger and bigger. I think they had bands from about four high  schools, grade schools, elementary kids marched. It   s just a really, really  wonderful way of remembering him and of course, the program follows  the parade. It keeps it on your mind, what he stood for.  What is it about Boley that keeps people there or keeps the connection  alive with Boley for those people who move to other places?  I think it is human for us to say,    Oh, it will probably come back again.  We will go back to those days.    Others, they just don   t want to leave  because of the memories of years gone by, so they stay there.  What do you think is the most important thing that people should know  20  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  Simpson  Patterson  about Boley?  That it is a town that has existed because of cooperation, dedication. One  of the things that we kind of forget is that a lot people came to Boley to  get rich. Someone had told them,    Go to that black town, it   s going to  rise up and you   re going to be rich.    As you read the history and you  look at some of the things that people did, you can   t help but wonder.  Then, like our people, they were just simply looking for a more  comfortable place to live. You get all of that together and you have a  town. (Laughs) Some of them say,    Well, I   ve lived here all this time.  I   m not going to leave,    and they don   t.  How would you like to be remembered?  I would like to be remembered as a person who was always concerned  about the other person, my fellow man. It is a part of me to want to give  back, help where you can, and just enjoy being a human being by  watching other human beings be happy.  Thank you very much, Mrs. Patterson, for you participation.  I appreciate it.  -------  -------
