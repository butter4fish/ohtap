 Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, May 11,  2012. I   m in Oklahoma City in the home of Deborah and Carl  Rubenstein. Carl, you   re an MD, a heart specialist. You play a mean  Indian flute. (Laughter) And Deborah, you   ve had a full life as a  homemaker; you guys travel a lot; you have a daughter in Italy; you   ve  been a big part of this collecting process; and you   ve both been involved  since the 1970s collecting Native art. Thank you for taking the time to  speak with me.  Glad to do it.  Yes, we   re happy to.  Let   s start with you, Carl. Where were you born, and where did you  grow up?  I was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and that   s where I grew up.  What did your mother and father do for a living?  My father was a CPA. My mother worked for my dad as a secretary.  That   s a pretty good summation. (Laughter)  Did you have much artwork in your home, growing up?  We did, not Native American art but a variety of forms of artwork, not  in any major sense. I had an interesting cousin, my dad   s cousin, who  really was a collector of some very interesting art and knew a lot of  artists in the New York area. We had a lot of exposure to art but not as  collectors.  No one in the family was especially artistic, but there was that interest?  5  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  My mother was musically artistic and actually did some painting, but  other than that, I   d say no, unless you count photography. I had an uncle  who was a professional photographer and a very good one.  You saw his work at an early age.  Yes.  Were you interested in drawing or painting, growing up?  (Laughs) Since I have absolutely no talent along those lines, I guess the  answer really is no. (Laughter)  You didn   t have really any chance to be around Native culture too much,  growing up?  Yes and no, I mean, certainly not the way we have here, but a lot of  Native American history in our area. The Lenni Lenape Indians were a  strong part of the history of the Perth Amboy area, and there were  murals in the high school, as I recall, portraying the life of the Lenni  Lenape.  So in your public school education you got some exposure.  Yes.  Great. Deb, how about you? Where were you born, and where did you  grow up?  I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I grew up there. My family   s  in the furniture business. My mother   s father started the business, and  my father continued it. After my father died, my mother continued it.  That   s what they did.  Did you have very much artwork in your home?  Yes, we did. It was not Native American art, but a lot of American  artists. Nobody  in the family  was artistic, per se, but  we  always  appreciated art.  Were these reproductions, or there were some originals?  Yes, they were originals. My parents had a great appreciation for beauty,  so they enjoyed the artwork. And we went to Cherokee  North Carolina   when we were young.  6  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  As a family road trip?  As a family, we went out West. We went to Santa Fe, and Mother and  Daddy collected small pieces from Lucy Lewis. My sister and I kept  saying,    Why didn   t we get something large?    when they were out there.  (Laughter) We did always have some Native American art, but not  hanging. It was more pottery. I guess it was all pottery, baskets.  They were collecting in the    40s, your parents were.  Yes, and the    60s, probably    50s and    60s, yes.  Did you have any extended family who were artistically inclined?  No.  How about your own interest in drawing or painting?  Oh, I always wanted to. I always wanted to be a pianist, but I didn   t have  any ability. (Laughter)  Carl, back to you. In junior high, high school, did you take any art  classes?  The art classes in the schools were part of the curriculum. There were  regular art classes, of which I was not one of the stellar performers,  (Laughter) but not really history of art or exposure to fine art. It was  mostly an attempt to get kids to be able to draw and create things, and  that was pretty limited for me. (Laughter)  How about when you got into college? I don   t know if you had an  interest in medicine yet, but did you have any art history background?  My interest in medicine really began when I was in grade school. That  continued on through, but that   s not what I pursued in college. Yes, I  took courses in art and art history while I was in college, with both  European art and American art.  When and how did you first meet Deborah?  Well, we met at the beginning of my internship  at Duke Medical  School  through one of Debby   s cousins who had given her name to one  of my roommates. He had never looked her up. When he left at the end  of medical school to head back east, we traded some names, and I called  Debby. (Laughter)  7  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  You guys were too busy to have a social life  (Laughter) Where were you  interning?  At Duke University in Durham.  Deborah, do you remember your first date with Carl?  I do. I do. His roommate was not going back east. He was going up  north because we were east. (Laughter) North Carolina is east, versus  Oklahoma.  I   ve been here so long, I forget that. (Laughter)  Yes, he came over to our house, and we went to the Velvet Cloak, which  was a restaurant and dance club in Raleigh. We had a really good time.  Do you remember if you went to any art exhibits? Was that part of your  dating life? Did you take in art together?  I   d have to say, during the dating phase, it really couldn   t have been  because time off for me meant one evening a week and one afternoon  and evening on the weekend. That was it.  He was on the rest of the time, constantly, and I was in college. We met  in August, and I went back to school in September for my senior year. I  was busy, and he was busy, so the answer is no. (Laughter)  You got married when you finished college. Was your first full-time job  in Oklahoma? Is that where you went first?  At that point, I did a research fellowship at Duke, and then went into the  Navy for two years, and back to Duke for residency in internal medicine,  then a fellowship in cardiology. And then we came out to Oklahoma.  (Laughs)  What year are we talking about?  We moved here in 1972. I was asked to come out and join the cardiology  faculty and the Medical Research Foundation. We thought we would  spend four or five years and head back east. (Laughter)  When did you attend your first Native art show here in Oklahoma?  Let   s see. I   m not sure when we attended our first Native art show. I  remember our first purchase here in Oklahoma was probably the  8  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein   Edward  Curtis photograph.  That was from the Pickard Gallery, and we did that right after we got  here. They were Curtis photogravure, and they had all kinds of the  photographs exhibited that time at the gallery. We just were floored by  them, so we bought   did we just buy the one, the photogravure?  We bought that one, initially, yes. That was one of the onion skin prints  from one of the original folios. It was one that we just fell in love with.  Had you collected some Native art before? What was your first piece  you collected together?  When we went to Myrtle Beach, which we do every summer, they have  an antique show that   s really nice. They had some wonderful pots, (that  was before we moved out here) and we bought several. They were  wonderful pots. They were forty dollars. We wanted three of them, but  we could only afford two. We   ve regretted that third one ever since   (Laughter) It was a wonderful black pot with a bear claw on it. We  didn   t get that one, and we really have thought about it forever. You  never forget those that you missed. Every year, even after we moved  here, we would go to that antique show. We bought stuff as long as they  had it.  Were these coming from the Carolinas, or were they coming from the  Southwest?  I think originally they were from the Southwest. I know they were, but  they had ended up in homes in the East and then in the estates. It was  very disappointing for us when they stopped having that sale because we  bought wonderful things.  By that time, we were out here and going back to the show and hoping  that we would find something really fantastic that they didn   t realize was  really fantastic. That never happened. (Laughter)  You did attend some Native art shows that were at the predecessor of the  Oklahoma Art Museum, at that point, the Oklahoma Art Center. Do you  remember the first time you went to that show?  I remember going to the gallery there. I don   t remember the first show  there.  Well, it would   ve been at the gallery. Imogene Mugg had that gallery.  Remember, one of the first pieces we bought was a Doc Tate Nevaquaya  piece. We went there a lot.  9  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  What drew you to that first piece?  Oh, we just loved it. It was color and very simple. It was very simple.  Do you remember the subject matter?  I think it was a peyote  ceremony .  Did Imogene spend time with you talking about the piece?  I   m sure she did. That was a long time ago. It was the early    70s. We  bought rugs from her, and I can   t remember what other pieces,  particularly.  I don   t know that we picked up any pottery from her or not. I don   t think  so. I think it was the painting and rug, a couple of rugs, and maybe some  jewelry but not much.  So far, you hadn   t met any Native artists at shows, in person?  No.  Do you remember the first show you went to where artists were present?  Probably at Doris     Littrell  at the Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery.  How did you discover that gallery?  Through Mimi.  Our friend, Mimi Smith, who knew Doris told us about it and maybe  brought us there for that matter. That really started things. That made a  big difference.  When you knew that place was there, you would go when you felt like it?  When we felt like it, but also whenever we got word from Doris that she  was having a show. Doris made the difference. Right off the bat, I think  we felt we were learning from her, and we enjoyed knowing her. That  created part of the attraction. Every time we went, we learned more  about the art and the artists. That is where we met the artists, and that  was another part of the appeal of what she did.  You met Doc Tate there, I   m guessing.  10  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Actually, I think we met him once before that at the state fair. He was  playing the Native American flute, which intrigued me. I talked with  him but actually bought my first flute from him at Doris    when we met  him again, subsequently. I remember that. I remember the first time we  saw him, heard him, and being so enamored of the Native American  flute.  Did you go to the fair for several years? Did you buy artwork at the fair,  too?  I don   t think we bought artwork at the fair.  But we did go. We went every year for a long, long, long time.  I don   t think of the state fair as being a focal point for artwork. That may  be unfair, but     They did sell a bit there, and even Doris had, at one point, some  paintings there. I think that was before you moved out here.  Yes, and nothing like what Red Earth was, for example, or what we saw  at a few of the powwows that we attended.  We also used to go, before Doris   , to Andy Anderson   s. Do you  remember that one? It was over near Classen.  Classen Circle.  I don   t remember buying anything.  It was a gallery?  It was a gallery, yes, and I   m trying to remember. We must have bought  something from him, but that was before we knew about Doris   .  His was a more eclectic place that had all sorts of antiques and artwork, I  think.  At what point were you conscious of the fact that you were becoming  collectors? (Laughs)  I don   t think you   re conscious of it. You just go and see things that you  love and can   t stand not bringing it home with you. (Laughter) I think  that   s the essence of a collector: people that really fall in love and want  something. Then it just continues. Then you end up being a collector. I  don   t think you start with that in mind, that you want to be a collector.  11  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  We only have things that we fall in love with.  Did you always fall in love with the same piece together? Did it ever  happen that you liked a piece that Carl didn   t like, and vice versa?  I really don   t think so.  Rarely.  We may have had different degrees of being enamored about a given  piece, but I don   t think we ever had a conflict over a given piece. We  really share a lot of taste maybe because, partially, I respect Debby   s  taste so much. (Laughter) Maybe it shaped mine.  Well, that   s a blessing that you   re both on the same wavelength. Is  collecting primarily an emotional experience? Is it partly an intellectual  experience?  A little bit of both. I think maybe more emotional than intellectual. I  don   t think we really thought of ourselves as collectors. I   m not sure we  really think of ourselves as collectors at this point, in the sense that we  don   t try to take a systematic approach to collecting a given type of work  or a specific artist and saying,    We have to accumulate as much as we  can of this.    We really have, by and large, gone on the basis of things  that sort of tug at our heartstrings. We   ve thought of ourselves as  accumulators more than collectors. (Laughter)  Exactly.  Did you notice any pattern to things that would attract you? Was there a  certain type of image, or did you just find yourself going back to certain  artists over and over? Were there any themes?  I think maybe the answer is in both areas. I think we   ve tended to really  enjoy things that have interesting people, interesting faces, interesting  stories, more so than things like landscapes, for example. Yes, we   ve  had an attachment to the works of specific artists, partially because they  had characteristics that we enjoyed and probably, partially, because we  got to know some of them. That makes a difference. I think that does  have an influence. If you enjoy the work of an individual and you get to  know that individual, it becomes even more enjoyable.  Going back to the first Indian flute you purchased from Doc, can you  describe your experience a little bit, how you chose the flute?  Actually, I think he had that flute with him at the gallery at Doris   . It  12  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  was one that he had made. I don   t remember the details of how it  occurred, but I admired it and asked if he made any that he would sell.  He said,    Well, I   ll sell you this one.    (Laughs) So that was the very first  one that I bought, which I still obviously have.  And you came home and practiced.  Began practicing and playing, mostly by ear, trying to pick up some of  the songs and the melodies that I heard him play, and others, but then  also adapting it to music that I   m familiar with. Particularly, as I   ve  collected more flutes over the years, which have different characteristics  as instruments, being able to use them for different kinds of music has  been really fun and interesting.  How many have you collected?  I think I probably have about twenty-five, twenty-six, something like  that.  And music, as well? Do you collect CDs of Native music?  Yes, and have made use of  the flutes  in a variety of settings including  in our worship services at our temple, which has really been very  enjoyable and interesting. I think people have really responded to it  because it   s a very beautiful, haunting sound that can be compatible with  Jewish liturgical music, just as it can be with folk songs or a variety of  things, in addition to the traditional Native American music.  There   s such a strong spiritual content a lot of times in Native art. I  know your Jewish faith is very important to you. I   m wondering if you  could talk about that, if you felt there were certain correspondences or if  you appreciated that aspect of it?  It   s something I   ve thought about over time because it   s interesting that,  maybe disproportionately, we   ve known a number of people who also  are Jewish who   ve had an interest in Native American art, and I   ve  wondered why. There are some spiritual feelings that I think are a part of  it, some of it, the respect for the spirituality of things in nature and the  respect for human beings, which you see portrayed very effectively. I   m  not sure I can put my finger on it beyond that.  I think it is part of the feeling, part of the attraction that makes us so  drawn to a lot of Native American art. Not all Native American art, but I  think many of the pieces have some sort of feeling, whether it   s for the  individual or for the setting or for the background story that become an  important part of it.  13  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  Did you want to add anything to that Deb?  I think he covered that beautifully.  You both joined the Oklahoma Indian Art Club. Can you tell us a little  about the club, Deborah, approximately when you got involved and what  its purpose was?  I can   t remember when we got involved, but it was probably ten years  ago, so that would have been in the    90s. It   s held at people   s homes,  and we have speakers. It   s also held on Friday nights, therefore (we go  to Temple) we don   t go very often. When we do go, we enjoy it. It   s  always a learning experience. If we feel like we can get away from  Temple and go, then we do try, but it   s probably twice a year that we get  to go. We enjoy it.  I think we learn both from the speakers and from the other people that  are part of the club because they have varied interests in different  components of Native American art. Some of them are very  knowledgeable. I think we really have enjoyed that.  They bring articles to show-and-tell, and people can tell what they know  about the things that other people bring. They have books they give  away. Marshall Gettys always brings books, and they have a raffle. If  you win, you get some educational information. It   s a lot of fun.  What have you taken for show-and-tell? Have you ever taken anything?  We haven   t gone enough to   I don   t think we   ve taken anything, have  we?  We probably have, but I really don   t remember. You   re right, our  attendance has been sparse enough that that   s not a significant part of  memories. (Laughter)  How did you find out about the collectors club?  Was it from Mimi?  No, I think it was from Peter Carl.  That seems to be another aspect of collecting or when you   re involved in  this art world is the network of relationships, not just with the artists but  then you start getting to meet other collectors. How has that changed the  process for you or enriched the process for you?  14  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  Peter Carl is probably a good example of someone we   ve gotten to know  because of mutual interests. His interest in pottery, in particular, is so  intense and so much in depth that we   ve learned a lot from Peter. We   ve  purchased things from him, as well. He   s helped us really enjoy learning  more about the pottery artists and about the pottery, itself, some  wonderful, wonderful pieces.  How have your tastes in collecting changed over the years, do you think,  from when you first began to collect Oklahoma Native art to today?  I don   t think, as far as paintings, our tastes have changed that much.  We   ve been able to afford more as time went on, and we   ve gotten to  know artists a whole lot better. That is a big influence. As far as pottery,  tastes, I think, have to fit your pocketbook a lot of times, (Laughter) so  when your children are older and you   re not expending as much in that  direction, you get to put a little bit more into the size of your pots.  Our interest in pottery, pretty substantially has been older pieces of  work, not as much contemporary or more modernistic forms of Native  American pottery. I think we really have and continue to really  appreciate older pieces of work, not just because they   re older but,  whether it   s shape or color or simplicity or a feeling that they create, it   s  something that   s a little bit different.  We do have a lot of contemporary artists, not modern design per se.  Contemporary potters.  Living contemporary potters. Judy Tafoya, we met at Red Earth,  probably through Peter. Who else have we met?  When you   ve been out to the Heard Museum     I don   t know that I   ve met so many besides Judy. We haven   t had the  privilege of meeting a lot of the potters. The few we have met have been  at Red Earth.  And the Cherokee potter.  Oh, Jane Osti.  Jane Osti.  I was wondering about Oklahoma potters.  15  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  We probably have met more and gotten to know more painters than we  have potters, and yet a large part of what we   ve collected over time  really has been pottery.  Besides the pots we brought here that we had gotten at the antique show,  Carl had a meeting in Scottsdale, and one of the first pieces we bought  was a Helen Shupla melon pot, which we just adored. We didn   t know  anything about Helen Shupla. We just bought it. The funny part of that  story was six months later, my sister went out to Scottsdale, and she  bought a Helen Shupla pot, and we had not communicated. (Laughter)  Hers was bigger, but it was the same black melon pot, just a different  size. We were just astounded when she told me. I said,    Hmm, we  bought one, too. How interesting.     That is funny. How does your artwork live in your home? Do you rotate  things around? Let   s talk about wall art and pots. Do you change things  up periodically? Do you sort of find a place, and that   s where they stay?  How do you decide where you put things? (Laughter)  If you left it to me, I would put it someplace and it would stay there.  Periodically, I come home, and I say,    Debby, what did you move?     (Laughter) We like to have the things that we enjoy out where we can  enjoy them. We try not to store them away or hide them away. We don   t  buy things with a specific place in mind to put them. We buy them  because we enjoy them and then find a place where we can enjoy seeing  them.  That   s primarily when we move things. When something new comes  into the house, you   ve got to find the right place for it, so everything  starts to be moved. That   s more pottery. Most of the artwork, the  paintings, have their spot, and they don   t move. Then it   s just a matter of  finding a ledge somewhere that the next piece can live on. (Laughter)  Are you pretty much in charge of that, Deborah, finding the right spot?  I do accept that as my  job , with Carl   s help. (Laughter)  And he orients himself by where the artwork ends up. (Laughter) How  many paintings do you think you own?  I know we have maybe thirteen by Merlin Little Thunder, at least.  (Laughter)  It   s probably fifteen, now.  Okay, somewhere in that area. Robert Taylor, we have several, some big  16  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  oils by him.  Probably five of his.  Bob Annesley seems to be another.  He was one of the first we met at Doris   . Then we bought  Stephen   Mopope and Doc Tate Nevaquaya, so a lot of Oklahoma art.  I think we have quite a few of Doc Tate   s scattered around the house.  Doc and Merlin and Robert Taylor are probably the ones of whom we  have the largest groupings.  Have you ever traded up, as they call it, where you took a piece that you  decided you could live without because you wanted a more expensive  piece?  No, never. (Laughter)  Once you fall in love, that   s it.  Yes. With these, it hasn   t changed. Our feelings about the paintings  haven   t changed if we bought it in the    70s or whatever, as long as they  were original and by an artist. The only things we   ve changed, we did  have some prints when we were younger, which we liked, but we have  moved those in favor of originals.  Have you gotten to take any to your office, Carl? Do you have art in  your office?  As a matter of fact, yes. (Laughter) Some of the paintings and some of  the photographs, the Curtis photographs, which I have carefully labeled  on the back, saying,    These belong to       (Laughter) Rugs, as well.  We   ve been able to enjoy having them in the office, also.  That was sort of a trademark of Doris    gallery, that combination of  pottery, rugs, paintings. Did you notice that right away?  Yes. Two of the rugs that I had originally in my old office before I  joined this larger group which we now have here, we bought through  Doris.  You have chairs in your office that we bought from Doris. I love the  furniture and the combination of it. It makes it homey. I think it   s a  wonderful way to display everything.  17  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  Have you collected any of the newer thirty-something artists, any  younger artists?  I don   t think so, yet. Do you?  No.  I don   t think so. There   s some that we were interested in, but we  haven   t.  I think that   s right. As we   ve seen their work, we   ve looked at them and  said,    Gee, that   s really interesting.    We enjoy them, but we haven   t said  we want to collect them or bring them into our home as much as the  artists who we have now.  We don   t have room. We   re out of room. (Laughter)  I think we   ve really enjoyed some of the younger artists and some of the  more contemporary Native American art. I guess we   ve got a few things  that would fall in that category, like Ben Harjo   s things, but that   s not  been our primary focus.  What do your children think about your collecting? Are they interested  in Native art, as well?  They think it   s wonderful, but are they as interested? Not now. Whether  they ever will want it themselves   I mean, I   m sure there are pieces that  each of them would want, but we find that our children are not collectors  or accumulators. (Laughter) The next generation doesn   t seem to be the  same. Maybe it   s lack of funds or they   re so busy     It   s not something they   ve developed yet, and I   m not sure they   d  develop the same interest. At some point, if they said,    Gee, I   d love to  have this particular piece in our home,    we would be glad to let them  have it. It will happen when we shuffle off this mortal coil. (Laughs)  We   ve thought about it. I don   t know which things they will want and  which they won   t.  I chuckled when you asked that initially because this last year when our  daughter, Anna, was here, they walked in, our grandchildren, our  youngest grandchild walked in and looked at her daddy and said,    They  really are obsessed with Native American things, aren   t they?     (Laughter) That was Leah.  Oh, that   s funny  Maybe the grandkids     18  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  I   m hoping.  And sometimes collectors do think about museums as being a place  where they   ll send paintings, as you probably know. You made a trip to  Arkansas to see Bill Wiggins  collection at the Sequoyah Institute ? Can  you talk about that a little, how you first met Bill and what it was like to  view that selection?  Bill was another person we met at Doris    gallery, saw him a number of  times there, and finally got to know him. The more we heard about his  incredible collection, the more we thought,    Well, gee, we really need to  see this.    He   s a delightful host. Last year, we went out there and spent a  weekend seeing the collection that he   s given to the university and  visiting in his home, as well. Now, there is a collector  There isn   t an  inch of wall space that isn   t covered with paintings, and I think he   s got  things stashed under the beds, in the closets    (Laughter)  Not everything   s on display.  No.  He really has, in some respects, taken a more methodical approach to his  areas of interest, which have been the central part of the country and  Canada, Alaska. It   s a huge. As you know, it   s a huge collection, and he  knows something about every single piece.  They do a lot of research about it. I was just overwhelmed by his  Northwest and Alaskan sculptures. My word, they are just fabulous  I  really enjoy Northwest, too. Remember the first piece   we were at the  antique show at Myrtle Beach. We saw a basket, and it was a very small  basket with the whales along the bottom. We didn   t know anything  about it, and we wouldn   t buy it until we went to the library and we  researched it. Then we raced back and bought that little basket.  (Laughter) That was our very first piece of Northwest. We started  learning about it, and it   s a fascinating area. The art is fantastic. We love  that. We want to go up and travel sometime. We haven   t done that.  We   ve enjoyed picking up some basketry, as well. Marshall Gettys  keeps telling us that the mistake we make in looking at pottery instead of  baskets is,    You can drop a basket, and it doesn   t break.    (Laughter)  There are some good basket makers here in Oklahoma. Given adequate  space and resources, what parts of your collection would you want to  deepen or broaden? It sounds like maybe Northwest coast art?  We would like to keep adding the things that we love. I don   t know that  19  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  we   d say there was one area that we wanted to deepen. Do you?  That in itself assumes, again, a more methodical approach to saying,     We want to expand a collection.    I think we would continue to look for  things from the artists who we have enjoyed. If we had significantly  more space, we   d probably expand beyond that. I think the same thing is  true of the pottery. I don   t think our tastes would change if we had more  space. We would just find more of the things that we already enjoy.  What advice would you give another Native-art collector who is just  starting to collect?  Buy what you love, but read and try to educate yourself about the artists  and the history.  Yes, I think that   s right. I would say don   t approach it as an investment  or creating a collection, but look at the things that stir something in the  way of an emotional response and then try to learn about them. That   s  what makes it really fun for us.  Did you ever get any advice from another collector or gallery owner  about Native art that stands out?  Peter has always given us lots of good information. Mimi Smith, she has  beautiful things. We love going to see what she has, and she comes to  look, and we share. (Laughs) She   s very knowledgeable.  In terms of a philosophy of approach, if that   s so, it   s something that has  developed subliminally by spending a lot of time with people like Doris  and Peter and Mimi and others from whom we   ve learned but not  someone trying to give us a philosophy of how to approach the art or the  artist.  I guess you   ve mentioned the generational   artists are concerned, too,  about this interest in Native art and how to sustain it. Why is it  important to collect Native art?  It helps the artist.  I mean, that   s a fairly generalized question.    Why is it important to  collect any art?    or,    What defines Native American art?    which is very  difficult, has gotten to be a more and more difficult question over time.  Yes, it   s important to support the artists, but in a sense, that   s a spinoff  from the fact that you really enjoy what they   re producing. If you are  collecting certain artists or certain categories, the fact that it encourages  that artist then means that he or she may be able to display more for  20  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  other people to recognize what they   re doing, which kind of spreads the  enjoyment and spreads their ability to survive as artists, which helps.  Is there anything you   d like to add or anything we   ve left out before we  take a look at a few of your favorite pieces?  It   s just been a pleasure through the years of being associated with Doris  and the Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery and still visiting her and sharing in  her open houses that she has. That has just been a wonderful thing for  us, and she   s a wonderful person.  All right, we   ll take a look at some of your pieces. We   re looking at one  of your pots. What would you like to tell us about this piece?  This is a pot that was done by Judy Tafoya, who is not from Oklahoma  but someone we   ve met in Oklahoma at Red Earth, year after year. This  is not one of the first of the pots that we   ve bought from her, but may be  the one that we think may be one of her best, one that we   ve really  enjoyed. It   s a good example of something you look at and say,    I love  that because of the shape, because of the polish, because of the  coloration.     The size.  Yes, but the shape makes the difference.  Oh, yes. It   s just a beautiful piece.  It   s probably one of her best in terms of the polishing, also, which is a  real art in itself as we   ve come to appreciate. We   ve got a lot of pots that  are small, but being able to create something that   s large, we   ve come to  understand, is a difficult thing in itself.  This is a piece by Merlin Little Thunder. We looked at this for a long  time at Doris    gallery. We finally were able to purchase it, and then no  sooner had we done that, they decided to make a poster of it for the  Jacobson House in Norman. I don   t remember. What was the show they  did the poster for?  I don   t remember, either. It was a Jacobson House show.  It   s a good example of something we were talking about before. If it  were only the landscape, it probably would not have interested us  anywhere near as much, but there are people, and there   s a story, which  is so typical of things that Merlin does. There   s an interesting story  involved. There   s humor that comes through.  21  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  D. Rubenstein  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  C. Rubenstein  Little Thunder  A big part of the story is in the title, isn   t it? What is it? The Day     Queen Anne Got Ditched at        Hog Creek. (Laughs) The Day Queen Anne Got Ditched at Hog  Creek.  It   s a wonderful piece.  Would you like to tell us about this one?  This is one of the very first paintings that we bought. We got this at the  Oklahoma Art Center. It   s a Doc Tate Nevaquaya. This is with the  peyote ceremony.  A really interesting early piece of Doc   s, probably from the     We bought it in the early    70s, so I don   t know exactly when it was  done, but close to that.  Yes, about that time. Probably the coloration, partially the fact that it  also involves an interest in what was happening in the story behind it  and learning something about Native American spirituality that probably  intrigued us. I think the coloration is a strong part of what was attractive  in that.  Nice composition, too. This last painting, is it an oil?  Yes.  Can you tell us about this one?  This is a painting by Gary Yazzie, a friend who lived here in Oklahoma  for quite a few years and has very strong ties to Oklahoma but whose  strongest ties, artistically, are to the land in which he grew up and the  Navajo people. When he paints things that come from that background,  we think he does probably his best work. He does focus a lot on people  and on horses and a feeling, a very peaceful feeling, that I think is  common to the things that he paints and even more so when he has spent  more time at home in New Mexico. That   s where his roots are, and I  think that influences his paintings in the most useful way for him.  Right. That   s a really nice piece of Gary   s. Well, thank you so much for  taking time to speak with me today.  22  D. Rubenstein  Well, we   ve enjoyed it. We   d love to put all our pieces out here.  (Laughter)  -------  -------
