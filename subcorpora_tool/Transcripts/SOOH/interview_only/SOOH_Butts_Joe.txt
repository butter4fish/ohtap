 Myers and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is April 20, 2012. I   m in Tulsa, Oklahoma, meeting at the  home of Joe Butts. I   ll be interviewing Joe today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Thank you for meeting here with me today.  You   re welcome.  Joe, would you tell me a little bit about your family and your childhood,  what it was like growing up here in Oklahoma?  I was born March 23, 1930 in Tulsa, Oklahoma at St. Johns Hospital. I  have a twin sister named Kaye. I graduated from Marquette High School  in Tulsa, went to the University of Tulsa, and graduated in 1955.  So it was you and your sister. Do you have any other siblings?  No, we   re the only children of Maurice and Cecilia.  What was school like for you, here? You said Marquette is where you  attended?  Right. It was a Catholic school. I started there in the first grade and  ended up in the twelfth grade, graduating from there.  What year did you graduate from there?  1948.  Did you participate in any sports or anything out there?  No.  5  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Any clubs or activities?  No.  No, just getting through school. (Laughs)  Right.  So you graduated in 1948.  I was eighteen years old.  At that point, did you join the marines, then? Or did you take a job prior  to that?  I joined the marine corps reserves.  Was that a unit here in Tulsa?  Right. It was the Twentieth Infantry Division.  Twentieth Infantry of the marine reserves here in Tulsa. Okay, so 1948,  it had only been a few years since the end of World War II.  Right.  What were your impressions at that time of what the societal climate  was towards war, towards the military in general? Let me rephrase that,  I guess. I know there was a big draw down of troops after World War II,  right?  Right.  So civilians in general, were they eager to move on past World War II?  Get on with the business of everyday life?  That   s right.  So, what prompted you, then, to join the marines at eighteen?  Oh, I   ve always admired the marine corps, especially the young men. A  friend of mine joined and he more or less talked me into it. Also, to  collect money from our drill days for the old slop shoot, our bar.  For the what, now?  6  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Slop shoot, that   s what the marines referred to as bars.  Oh, for the bar. Money for the bar. Gotcha. (Laughter) So you joined up.  You said you   d always wanted to join the marines. Who was your friend  that talked you in? Do you recall his name?  He dated my sister. (Laughter) No, I can   t remember     Don   t remember his name, okay. So the two of you joined. Where did  you go to boot camp at?  I didn   t.  Can you explain that for me?  I had three summers in summer camp. In the marine corps, that qualified  you for active duty.  Okay. Where did you take your summer camps at?  Sent me to Camp Pendleton.  Out in San Diego?  Camp Pendleton, San Diego.  So what kind of things would you do during summer camp?  We did our close order drills. We went to the firing range. Basically,  that   s about it.  So close order drill, firing range. Three summers of that, which would  have been about six weeks total?  Right.  And then once a month, you   re going to drill dates.  Right.  So all that combined totaled up to boot camp. The unit you were in was  the Twentieth, was an infantry unit. What was your job, specifically, in  that unit?  Over at the machine gun squad.  7  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Machine gun squad, okay. Were you an assistant gunner, were you an  ammo bearer?  Ammo bearer.  Can you tell us a little about that, as far as being an ammo bearer?  There was a lot of muscle  needed to  horse around the ammunition,  carrying it in canisters. We usually carried one in each hand.  How heavy were those canisters of ammo?  I don   t remember. Probably twenty, thirty pounds.  So they were probably around 500 rounds per canister, a thousand  rounds per canister?  It wasn   t 500.  Maybe 250.  Probably so.  Set up on belts, all ready?  Right, right.  What kind of machine gun was that?  Thirty caliber, air cooled.  Thirty caliber, air cooled. So, it was tripod mounted?  Right.  We   ll go back a little bit. Can you tell me a little about your life during  World War II? What was that like?  We lived close to Swan Lake. We didn   t have a car. The city bus  stopped about two houses from our house, so we rode the bus  downtown, shopping. The YMCA was downtown. Every now and then,  an aunt or uncle, we   d go with them to Mohawk Park for a picnic.  So pretty lean times during World War II?  8  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  No, not really. Mom   s family was here in Tulsa. We were close to the  Boston Avenue Church. And the sisters, which there was five, in the  summertime, would gather at the homestead after going to the farmer   s  market and picking up varied vegetables. As a group, they   d work  canning and putting up vegetables for winter. My grandfather had a  house repair business. Usually, that consisted of re-roofing. He took a  liking to me and kind of moved me toward carpentry.  Okay. So you joined the marines, the reserve unit here in Tulsa, the  Twentieth. Do you recall your first days in service? What were those like  with the marines?  Joining the reserves or active duty?  With the reserves first. How was that? How were your first days in  there?  It was fun. They taught us how to march, right and left. Then the  summer camps were, again, a lot of fun.  How about your first days in service with the regular marines?  Oh, that was confusing. I can remember getting on the train and heading  for Camp Pendleton and all the parents out along the railroad site as we  loaded up. It was kind of like the whole family was there. Everybody  was up real high and anxious to get moving.  Sure. Do you remember what date that was, roughly, that you got  activated?  Yes, it was July.  July of 1950?  Yes, right.  Okay. So you   re shipping out on trains. Where were you heading out  from? Here in town? Here in Tulsa?  Here in Tulsa, yes.  So the train left here from Tulsa. Where did it head to? Went down to  Oklahoma City and straight out west or just head straight out west from  Tulsa, here?  I think we went to Oklahoma City. I   m not sure. I think we did and  9  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  headed due west.  So you headed out west to Pendleton.  Right.  You   d been there three times before. So it wasn   t a new experience to get  to Pendleton, but...  No, we went to Tent Camp Two. I was trying to remember the other day,  of where the other location  was . Tent Camp Two, that was a big one.  That was the one that was headed for Korea. That   s where we did our  drawing of various  combat  gear.  So Tent Camp Two at Pendleton, you drew  combat  gear. How long  were you at Pendleton before you got on the ships and headed out?  Two weeks, if I remember correctly.  Two weeks. How was your ship ride over? How was that?  Fine, I didn   t get seasick. (Laughter) Saw other people get it. Heading  for Japan, it was quite a ride.  Did you hit any rough seas or anything like that?  We ran into a hurricane at Kobe, Japan, where we landed. That was  interesting.  I   ll bet. So did you have to stay on the ship when you were there   ?  We stayed on the ship until the hurricane passed and then spent two  weeks or ten days. We made the invasion the 15th of September.  That was at Inchon?  Yes.  So the fifteenth, you spent two weeks at Kobe. Any training that went on  on the ship as you were heading over?  Any what?  Training, any kind of follow-up on training?  Yes, we reviewed various procedures and weapons.  10  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Firing off the ship at targets?  One crew was firing off the ships, I remember, but our group     Never did?  No.  So you hit Kobe, make it through the hurricane there, and then you head  out for Inchon two weeks later. How was that? How was the landing at  Inchon and the contact, there?  Well, they woke us up, seems to me, between three thirty or four. We  started preparing to go over the sides and got all of our gear squared  away. It was quite a ride going to the seawall. I understood later on that  we landed on the wrong beach. We were supposed to land on Red  Beach, but we ended up landing on Blue Beach. By the time we got to  shore, it was around three or four o   clock in the afternoon. So, it was  from three o   clock that morning till three o   clock that afternoon that we  landed.  What kind of boats were you in for the landing?  Landing crafts.  Okay, so you were in the landing craft for twelve hours, roughly.  About eight hours.  Heading from the ship into Inchon.  Yes. We took some incoming fire going in, small arm fire. We went up  the seawall on the ladders that we   d built and dug in that night, there.  So you actually built the ladders that you used to climb the seawalls?  Yes. I don   t remember us building them. All I know is we     You just had them with you in the landing craft?  Right.  Then you dug in there at the seawall that night?  No, we went in a little ways. I  paired  up with a foxhole buddy. I don   t  11  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  know where he came from. He wasn   t in our outfit, but I ended up with  him in my foxhole. (Laughs)  Do you remember his name?  I have no idea what his name was. All I know is he was a black person,  very friendly, and we covered each other   s back.  He wasn   t part of the unit?  No. That   s the surprising thing. I   ve often wondered about him.  So when you got to Pendleton, with your reserve unit, you guys were  mixed in with regulars, there?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The Fifth and Seventh Marines were basically  seasoned troopers, a lot of them from the Second World War. Is that  right?  Yes.  I think that   s right. That   s the way it was. I was attached to Charlie  Company.  Is there anything you learned, prior to heading out or once you got there  to Inchon, from those seasoned guys that helped you out?  We were always looking up to them. Most of them were reservists and  they put some seasonal troopers with us to fill in, to guide us.  But nothing really kind of pops out that you would have picked up from  those guys, those seasoned marines, those World War II veterans?  Well, yes, our squad leader   I had his name on the tip of my tongue, but  I can   t remember right now.  That   s okay. What would you have learned from him? What stands out  from that squad leader?  He was very concerned about us. He gave us direct commands, good  commands. If something happened he didn   t like, he pretty well chewed  you out.  He let you know about it. (Laughs)  Yes.  12  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Okay. What kind of resistance did you meet there at Inchon? How long  were you there?  We were only in that area for a day or day and a half, and we moved  over to Yongdung-po, which is the airbase for Inchon. They had a big  brewery there, if I remember correctly.  A big brewery? (Laughter)  Yes. I didn   t participate and the fellows in my squad didn   t. I think we  were in a different area. But we heard all the stories.  I see. So that was kind of the staging area to head out to Seoul?  Yes. We could take that road on down, which the Seventh Marines  landed with their artillery, their 105s, 155s to cover us going in.  So you moved into Seoul. That was, what, about a week later?  No, I would say it was maybe two or three days.  Two or three days, all into Seoul.  Yes. Captain Barrow was, I think, the Baker Company CO. He was a  fine gentlemen, good tactician. We worked our way from the outskirts of  Seoul to the train station. There in the waiting rooms, we saw quite a  few dead women and their children. Looked like they   d been shoved in  there and concussion grenades had been used.  That was by the North Koreans had done that?  Yes, that   d be the North Koreans. We took it and brought a couple tanks  and jumped off from the train station, heading toward downtown and the  palace. We spent, I believe, a day. We didn   t dig in, that I know of.  Again, I   m thinking we made it to the outskirts of Seoul. Stayed there, I  think, three or four days. They brought in trucks, instead of going  through downtown Seoul to go back to Inchon to board ships to go to  Wonsan, North Korea. I   m getting ahead of myself.  How was the fighting in Seoul?  I think they were a little concerned about it because the marine corps had  never established itself as far as I know, as a house to house, city to city,  type of unit. We were set up for the tropics or island general fighting.  We took some casualties there, some real fine people. One of the boys,  13  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Howard Collins, he     Howard Collins was one of the guys that was hit there outside of Seoul,  on the outskirts?  He was at Yongdung-po.  Yongdung-po. He was from the Tulsa unit     Right. Right.  What was his rank?  PFC  Private First Class , I think.  PFC. Can you tell me a little bit about Howard?  Very likable person. Seemed to be very sincere, just one of these All-  American guys. You liked being around him.  Now you said he was a Golden Gloves boxer?  Yes.  Here in town?  Yes.  Traveled the southwest doing that, or   ?  I don   t know how much he traveled. He went to Rogers High School.  Basically, he was a local boy. He fought regionally, I think.  He was killed in an area where you were trying to cross a small bridge,  is that right?  Yes.  And he took gunfire there?  Right.  What happened after that? Was he evacuated out then at that time?  I don   t know. Our squad was back about maybe fifty yards from where  he got hit, or twenty-five yards. I remember somebody saying,    Howard  14  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  got hit. Howard   s been shot.    We took other casualties, but I didn   t  know who they were.  No one you knew directly. So after that     It seems to me, coming back, after we took Yongdung-po, we dug in  there in a warehouse. We were there a couple days, three or four days.  Anything interesting happen there?  Yes. (Laughs) I had a South Korean   I thought was a South Korean, I  don   t know   but I needed a haircut. Somehow, we negotiated it. How, I  don   t remember, but I got a haircut. I was told later on, they said I was  lucky I didn   t get my throat slit. (Laughter)  Oh, no kidding?  Yes  (Laughs) So, we had to watch the natives. We didn   t know who  was on whose side or what.  So you got a haircut from one of the locals.  Yes. As long as they said,    You all,    we were all right. We knew they  were from the south. (Laughs)  Oh, no kidding?  So, if they didn   t say,    You all        Then they   d be from the North.  That   s right. That was a running joke over there. So, from there, we  moved up through Seoul to the university. Did we cover that?  Say that again, the university?  Yes.  No, we haven   t yet talked about the university.  We ended up in the outskirts of Seoul and dug in there for three or four  days. The university and the museum were quite an elaborate layout. Of  course, it got pilfered by the natives. Our next operation was to board  ships at Inchon and go to Wonsan  , Korea .  That was right to Wonsan?  15  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Yes.  So how was that trip and once you reached Wonsan?  We spent I think it was a week aboard an LST. That   s a Japanese.  Evidently, we   d borrowed it or rented it from the Japanese. It was in bad  shape, but it carried the troops. (Laughter) We went back and forth over  the thirty-eighth parallel line waiting for some tactical command, which  we finally got. We landed at Wonsan at the old submarine harbor,  whatever they called it, that the Japanese built during the Second World  War to hide their subs and protect their subs. Coming in, we were hell  bent on   we were going to tear up the place. Not a shot was fired     Oh, at Wonsan? Not a shot.  North Koreans had gone.  So they had bugged out, all the North Koreans. From what I understand,  they had to clear the harbor first there at Wonsan for mines around the  harbor.  That   s right.  You guys were floating off shore for a week or so? Week and a half?  I think that   s what it was.  Once you got in to Wonsan, pick up there, what happened from that  point? You   re offloading from the boats, where do you go from there?  We dug in and stayed there for, I guess, maybe a couple days. We  headed north of Wonsan right along the coastline. Just a beautiful area,  white sand and blue water. I can   t remember the town they sent us to,  but it was a rail head. Somebody said that the mountains around us, they  called it Diamond Mountain.  Why   d they call it Diamond Mountain?  Because the Diamond Mountain boys were controlling it. (Laughter) We  pulled back out and got on another rail head, and the army came in and  took over our position. That   s when we moved on up toward the  Chosin     Toward the Chosin Reservoir. You proceeded from where at?  16  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  From the town of Hung-ni, which was a rail head, the First Marine  Regiment, dug in there. Meanwhile, the Fifth and Seventh Marines had  advanced to Koto-ri.  Where did you guys move to first once you were heading towards  Chosin?  Where   d we head first? Well, we left Hungnam   I think that   s right. We  left Hungnam on the railroad in boxcars north to Chinhung-ni. That   s  where the marines dug in, First Marine Regiment.  That   s at Hung-ni?  Yes. Then on up to Koto-ri and then we ran a supply  depot .  So Koto-ri is the southernmost point of the reservoir, right?  Right.  Did you guys linger there at Koto-ri for any period of time?  We were there for about   I want to say a week. Supplies came in to  Chinhung-ni, and then we loaded up trucks. A lot of us were put on the  trucks as guards and ran up by rail up to Koto-ri. The Able and Baker  Companies were the two main companies. Charlie was in reserve.  So Charlie Company was in reserve at that time?  Able and Baker ran the ridgeline and also the supply lines. Charlie  Company was attached to   was set up in reserve. Of course, we zeroed  in all our weapons. On the twenty-seventh, I think it was, November is  when the Chinese     Started to attack?  Yes.  So where were you at on the twenty-seventh? Were you already up at  Yudam-ni at that time? Just so people know, Yudam-ni is on the west  side of the reservoir.  Yes. I never made it to Yudam-ni. I never made it there.  Where   s the farthest forward that you made it?  Hagaru.  17  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Hagaru. So you were at Hagaru on the 27th of November?  I can   t tell you. I can   t tell you. All I know   I remember the trucks  going out of Koto-ri.  So where were you at on that first night of the attacks? How was that  first night?  Well, it woke me up. (Laughs)  Woke you up. You were asleep at that time?   We were on 50  watch, 50  watch . Twenty-seventh, wasn   t that  close to Halloween? I think we were kidding each other around the  bonfire late in the evening. It was about Halloween.  So Thanksgiving would have been a few days earlier.  Yes. Thanksgiving, I cooked home cooked turkeys. Then we kicked off  by the road. There was a road towards Koto-ri. All I know is we drew  fire going up to that road. Snowing, you couldn   t see ten feet in front of  you. We could hear the Chinese talking.  They were that close?  Yes. They got closer, later on. (Laughs)  I   m sure. So you were asleep when they     I wasn   t asleep.  I was on 100  watch.   Not that night, but on the initial attacks that they put on, you got woken  up, right?  Yes.  I   ve heard and I   ve read accounts of them, the Chinese, blowing whistles  and bugles, things like that. Is that what woke you up?  I only heard that once. I heard the same thing you did. I was told that I  would be hearing it soon. We had been at Chinhung-ni long enough to     our foxholes were about three foot deep. The reason for that is we had a  mountain in front of us and it elevated going up. The Chinese were  using   that   s when they brought in the horses.  We  got hit on the right  flank in Koto-ri. We didn   t get to see them. We could hear them, though.  18  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  They said the Mongolian ponies were coming and the Chinese were  riding them in  but I didn   t see them .  You said that was on the right flank? Would that be your Able Company  or Baker Company?   Baker Company.  They were on the east. Anyway, the twenty-seventh,  twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth, when we kicked off to open up the  road   I   m sure the day is in here, that I   ve lost. We spent three or four  days, I guess, there at Chinhung-ni before we went up.  Can you tell me a little about the unit you were with there, rather than  the dates and times or anything like that, just more about the unit, the  guys you knew there?  We were tied in with the eighty-one millimeter mortar. While we were  tied up, they took a different spot. The road would cut into the mountain  and come back out. The army sent up quad .50  caliber  machine guns  and dual twenty millimeter, which was aircraft support. They brought  their own diesel, ran their motors all night long, and from the heat off  the motors got warmed up, and pulled back.  And sometimes there were  warming tents, for fifteen minute warm-up stays.   Where was that at?  That was about a quarter of a mile or a mile north of Chinhung-ni. Then  word came that we were pulling out. Charlie Company was detailed up  to the east side of the reservoir. Able and Baker, Charlie Company was  holding right in that dentation area. It   s hard to explain. Various units  started passing. These trucks  were  loaded with  dead  marines, like  corn ears would be thrown on top of each other.  These were the dead and wounded being evacuated out?  Right. One helping the other. The Chinese, of course, were getting in  front of us as we were moving south. They   d ambush us and we   d send a  squad up or a platoon up. Well, we didn   t have platoons. They were  squads   to clear the road. They brought us down to Chinhung-ni, down  to Sudong. I   m lost in there. I   ve got a blank for some reason.  That   s okay.  I can see it in my mind, but I can   t     Were there many casualties in your unit when you were up there?  19  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Not in our unit. We didn   t have any. We had light casualties, but  casualties were frozen feet.  Frozen feet, cold hands     My hands are still cold. I can   t stand cold weather.  Can you tell me about a couple of your most memorable experiences  there or just one?  The famous one I have is standing next to the quad .50 and the British  marines came around. As they came around the curve, they were pretty  well shot up. They had a lot of casualties. There weren   t too many of  them. Somebody in the rank, as they passed somebody in the rank, in  our ranks, said,    How about some cocoa, fellows?    Deep down, in the  midst of these young men, you could hear,    Cocoa  Why, not even the  officers had cocoa     That has stuck with me ever since. (Laughter)  That   s was with the British troops? (Laughs)  The British marines. (Laughter)  Were you awarded any medals or citations?   Yes.  I got the usual Korean  medals . I didn   t pay attention to them.  That   s part of our job. A lot more should have had it than me.  So the key push was to get the Chinese back across the Yalu?  Yes, and they darn near made it. Koto-ri, I guess, was one hell hole.  What was the food like when you were there?  I knew you   d get around to that. (Laughter) We had C-rations, and  they   re a gourmet   s delight. (Laughter) Especially when the temperature  was forty to sixty below. We   d have to cut out both ends of our C-ration  can and eat the soup or the hamburger patties or beanie weenies like a  popsicle, push-up popsicle. Believe me, there wasn   t anything more  delightful.  What was your favorite meal out of the C-rations?  We   d fight for beanie weenies. (Laughter) Or fruit cocktail, that was a  delicacy. Did a lot of trading back and forth on that. Amazing what you  can get with a can of fruit.  20  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  So did you have plenty of supplies while you were there?  Well     I know that     Go ahead.  I know with that draw down of the military after World War II, the  drawn down military supplies, usually go away, so     Well, our cigarettes, we were all smokers. Cigarettes came in a  container, an aluminum foil-type wrap. They were rations from the  Second World War. Lucky Strikes was our favorite. Only problem is,  they were so old that when you open the package, if you weren   t careful,  they would crumble. They were so old and dried out.  Do you have any accounts or any memories of firsthand contact with the  North Koreans or Chinese that you   d like to talk about?  Not really. The thing that was sad is that particularly, the Chinese, they  were so young, those boys. The clothes, they didn   t have for protection.  It wasn   t unusual to see them just frozen.  They weren   t equipped for the weather.  They weren   t equipped for it. But the Chinese did one hell-of-a-job  tactical, but they just couldn   t take the desire the marines had. Our  leggings, particularly the North Koreans, they knew the Americans     leggings and their camouflaged helmet covers. They wanted to be  captured by the  marines because of good treatment as a prisoner, food  and clothes .  Oh, no kidding?  Yes, they respected the marine corps.  Was there something special you did for good luck? Anything you  carried for good luck?  No.  No?  No. (Laughter) Oh, I take that back. My mom sent me a finger rosary. It  probably got me through.  21  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Yes. You got that while you were there in Korea?  Yes.  What did you think of your officers or your fellow marines?  I thought they were great. Very congenial. No class division.  Everybody just threw in when they had to.  Oh, yes.  Did you keep a personal diary?  I started to. It started out with three pages. I ran across it the other day,  and it doesn   t make sense. (Laughter)  Just a few lines here and there of your experience?  No     Just things scratched down, huh? Doesn   t make any sense at all.  Yes. One other thing that comes to mind that was a lot of fun was when  we were aboard the LSTs going back and forth across the thirty-eighth  parallel, our gunner on the rockets was an ex-cook. He knew that I liked  to bake. So, we got aboard ship, and we found out we had a hell-of-a-lot  of flour and some other goodies so I made apple popovers.  Oh, okay.  We fried apples, yes. The crew all thought it was great, all the guys  aboard. (Laughter) The only thing I forgot to tell them, this one fellow  came up and told me, said,    Joe, did a hell-of-a-job, but were those little  raisins in there?    I said,    Yeah.    They were weevils. (Laughter) So, the  whole ship had weevils. (Laughter) I was a young kid, had a good life.  So what did you do after the war?  Aboard ship, we had to put in for our duty posts. I put in for McAlester.  Oh, to the ammo plant?  Me and ten thousand others  (Laughter) Me, being a PFC, not quite  turning to a corporal, I didn   t get it. But lo and behold, I got the dream.  22  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Oh, yes?  Of DI  Drill Instructor  at Paris Island.  Oh, you got to be a DI at Paris Island?  And I   d never been through DI school.  No kidding?  Boy, I thought that was great,    Now, I can be a real marine. I   ll have  everything, then.     How long were you a drill instructor there at Paris Island?  Well, let   s see. We got there in September, October     That   d been    51?  Yes. So, Captain Barrow was CO of our recruit battalion on Paris Island.  I played runner a couple days for Barrow and Captain Ray, who was the  CO of Charlie Company. Barrow was just one of these real nice guys  and sharp as hell. Hell, I hadn   t been at Paris Island a week or ten days  when I got a call to go to see him. I thought,    What in the world did I  do?    (Laughter) I went over there and he said,    Butts, I see you   re a  college boy.    I said,    Yes, sir.    He says,    Do you want to go to OS?    I  said,    No, sir.    He said,    What do you want to do?    I said,    Go back to  college and get my degree.    He says,    Can you be ready in ten days?  I   m releasing you.     I   ll be.  So, I came back here and joined the   well, I joined the AROTC at the  University of Tulsa. The main reason I did, when I was in Korea I got  two draft notices sent to the house and Dad mailed them to me.  (Laughter) I didn   t have enough time in to avoid any other conflict so I  couldn   t get out, but I could transfer. So, I transferred to the AROTC at  the University of Tulsa and went to summer camp. Was in it for thirty  days at Phoenix Luke Air Force Base. Me and a fraternity brother, I got  Honorary Cadet from the University of Tulsa. They sent me on a special  project to Luke Air Force Base where they were showing a big air force  bombardment by aerial craft. I can   t think of the fraternity brother   s  name, but he says,    Do you really want to go to this show?    I said,     No,    so we went to the slop shoot and drank beer all afternoon.  (Laughter) I had that article and I told my boys, I said,    I was an  23  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  Butts  Myers  honorary cadet from the University of Tulsa.       No, Dad.    I said,    Yes, I  set up the drill team for them.    We drilled one afternoon during the  ballgame.  I   ll be.  So, anyways, I wish I would have gone to boot camp because that   s     especially if you go to a museum now and see what it was like.  How do you think that Chosin, your experiences there and your  experience in the marines during the Korean War, how has that affected  your life?  It taught me a lot about being myself and being honest and set your  goals and follow through. That really helped me through my life.  Coming from just a sister and no brothers, it made a big difference in my  success. I was lucky, believe me.  Is there anything you wanted to cover that we haven   t already covered  here today?  No, I think we pretty well hit it. I   m missing some areas that I   m not  sure of.  Maybe we can revisit that in the future, if you   d like.  Yes, might want to re-correct that.  All right. Well, I want to thank you for taking the time to meet with me  today. It   s been a pleasure.  It   s been enjoyable.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
