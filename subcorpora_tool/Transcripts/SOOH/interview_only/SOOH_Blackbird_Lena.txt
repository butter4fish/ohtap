 Little Thunder  Blackbird  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, January 25,  2013, and I   m interviewing Lena Blackbird as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Ms.  Blackbird   s home in Tahlequah. Lena, you   ve been making Cherokee  baskets for many years and specializing, I think, in double-walled  baskets?  Yes.  You   ve also been an exhibitor with the Tsalagi Village at the museum   Cherokee Heritage Center , and your baskets have been featured in  several books. You   ve taught a lot of people how to do this. Thank you  for taking the time to talk with me today. Where were you born, and  where did you grow up?  I just grew up around here in Cherokee County, in Rocky Ford.  What did your folks do for a living?  Really, no jobs, but I guess you would just call them farmers or laborers  or something like that, just making it.  Right. Did you have your grandparents on both sides?  No, I really didn   t know, on my dad   s side, my grandparent. I didn   t  really know him. He was gone. He had gotten separated from the family  a long time ago, a long time ago, so we really didn   t know him.  My mother   s side, he was around, but we didn   t really stay close touch  with him either. He lived around Welling, Oklahoma, and sometimes  he   d come to visit, but that was about all the real grandparent.  5  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  What are your earliest memories of seeing artwork, even sewing or  painting or baskets?  Well, I   ve been sewing since   I guess I really started sewing when we  would go to church and help our mother sew at the church on  Wednesdays.  Was it quilting or     Yes, quilting. We would get quilt tops, my mother, from whoever  wanted to have their quilt there quilted, and we would make a little  money for that church, for missions work. That   s where I learned how to  sew.  Did you like it? What did you like about it?  When I was little, I guess, I thought I was really made to do it. I   d rather  been out and be playing somewhere. (Laughter) My parents were pretty  strict. They wanted us to learn things.  Probably, it taught you patience. You were working with your hands,  doing fine work.  Yes, using a needle and a thimble, we would sew those quilts. Put them  on frames, and we would sit around the quilt and sew. Women would be  laughing and talking and talking about things and having fun, too.  Yes, good visiting time. Did you like to draw, or were there any other  kinds of     No, that   s one thing I never did. Never got interested in drawing or  anything like that. Didn   t seem too interesting to me.  Where did you go to school?  We went to this little place at Rocky Ford. It   s still standing there, but  it   s about half gone. It was a brick house, and it   s about half gone. That   s  where I went until I finished in the eighth grade.  What was it like for you going to school?  There wasn   t very many kids going at that time because we had to walk.  There were no buses or anything to catch right by the door. In winter  time, we   d have to walk. We   d have to bundle up if we had enough  clothes, bundle up and go to school. Sometimes there were just about  6  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  four students come, and we were kind of pleased when there was just a  few of us there that we got a treat. We got an apple or a orange.  (Laughter)  You grew up with Cherokee as your first language.  Yes.  Was school an adjustment? Was it hard to adjust to     To the school? You mean when I first started?  Yes, in English.  I guess it was. I guess I really didn   t want to go. (Laughs) I think my  mother made me go. Sometimes later, I really didn   t like to go because I  would be crying sometimes, not wanting to go, but she made me. She  made me go. At least I got that far. (Laughter)  She   s a good writer.  Oh, and you like to write, Lisa says?  I like to write. I like to read. I used to like to read poems, and I   ve got a  few that I   ve written. But my hands now are shaky, and I can   t hardly  write good anymore, so I just don   t do much.  Did you do any artwork in school that you remember or make anything,  any crafts, in school?  I don   t remember. Making little special things, like specific things. Just  doodling, I guess. (Laughter)  Little art projects?  Yes.  Did you like those?  Yes. I guess. That   s what we were told to do at that time, so you did it.  So what happened after you finished school?  I think I started   I tried to go to Oaks High School, but I didn   t finish  even the first year. I just went that far. That   s as far as I went in school.  7  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  What were the reasons that you     I guess we had to do a lot of things to help the family and do housework  and just doing things to help because we lived on a farm, and we had to  do a lot of things. Going to school was not part of what I liked to do.  (Laughter)  Were you the oldest?  No. There was eight of us in the family. I was the sixth one, I think.  Oh, okay, so you were needed to help around home. When did you learn  basketmaking?  Some people say they learned it from their grandmother or their mother  or that they   ve been doing them for a long, long time, but for me, I  didn   t start that far back. I started working at the Village, at the Heritage  Center, and the other ladies, they taught me then. That   s when I got  interested in the basketmaking, among the other things that we did in the  Village.  That   s really interesting. Was it in the    80s when you started working at  the Village?  I think it was. I think it was in the   80s. I think I started working there in     86 or something around there. Almost immediately after that, I learned  how to make baskets.  What was it like working in the Village?  It made you think. It made you think about how Indians and how people  lived, how they lived back then, most of all how they could have made  it. Didn   t have any store-bought things, or didn   t go to the store to buy  this and that. A lot of things came from the woods, and greens and stuff  like that that they would gather to eat, and the fruit. When we were  growing up, it was a lot better by then, but that   s what I used to think  about. I used to think about how they lived back then, long time ago.  I guess everybody is doing some kind of activity in the Village, right?  You had to have a chore to do, but you were attracted to the  basketmaking.  Yes. They had food they made out of hickory nuts from the woods, and  they made soup out of it. I was the one that demonstrated how to make  it, but I don   t know how, now. (Laughter)  8  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Uh-oh. All that practice     I   ve about forgotten how to make it now.  She told me how.  Yes, that was the demonstration I did when tourists came by, to show  them how it was done. What all they had to eat and where they got it and  stuff like that.  So when you asked some of the ladies over there to teach you to make  baskets, were you doing that in the course of the demonstration? Did  you get to be by them, or did you do that afterwards?  The tourists was kind of like in between. The tourists would go by, and  there   d be a little while before another tourist came by. A group came  by, and in between that   s what we did. We made baskets.  Did you take to it right away?  Pretty much, but it took a little while. I think my first basket looked like  a cone. (Laughter) I couldn   t shape it, I mean, make it flat, flat the way it  starts out, until later when I learned how to do it.  What material were you working with at the Village when you were  learning how to make baskets?  We used mostly the commercial reed being to practice on, to learn on,  and then if we could get the natural reed, well, we might get it from  somebody that would get it for us. I didn   t go out and get it myself too  much. I just used to get it from someone that did, that liked to do that.  So when did you think,    I really have the hang of this. I want to see if I  can sell these or show these   ? How many years was it?  What was the question?  How many years before you started trying to sell your baskets?  Oh, almost immediately they would start selling. That   s what I  remember about them. I guess they liked them. (Laughs)  Did you start off with certain designs? What designs did you start off  with?  We started with the plain, without no color in them. When we were  9  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  learning how to do it, we just mostly used the plain without using color  in it until later when we got a little better, we started using color on  them.  They were open baskets, double-walled?  Yes, they were double-wall baskets. They were open mostly at the  beginning, but later you learned how to make the lid, to put the lid on the  top, and then make a little knob on top where you could pick it up, pick  up the lid and open it.  Were there a lot of basket makers at the time that you were learning or  just a few?  There were several, but not a whole lot were there at that time. I know  my sister-in-law was there. She had been doing it for quite a while. The  other ladies   Nadine was there, and she would help me with it. There  was another older lady, Diane   I forget her last name. I   m sorry. She  was older than us, and she had been doing that for a long time.  So tell us about the first time you won an award for your baskets.  Somebody encouraged me to enter the basket that I had made, and I took  it to the Art Under the Oaks in Muskogee. It was a honeysuckle basket  with a lid and had, I think, little decorations, acorns on it or something  like that. I was surprised. I was happy.  Somebody else entered at the same time, and we were all outside when  they were calling our names what we had won. When they got to the  basketry, they called somebody else   s name, and I thought,    Uh-oh.    I  got disappointed, and somebody next to me said,    Oh no, they didn   t  even call your name.    The next name they called, they said,    The best of  the show is Lena Blackbird,    so I came alive again. (Laughter) I had  won the Best of Show award.  Oh, the Best of Show award. Wow, that   s very impressive.  That was the first time I had entered a basket.  So it had little acorns on top. Was it plain-colored? Did it have any  designs on it, too?  I think we were using color, started using color then. We used a lot of  the commercial color, but we used a lot of the other natural color like     I   m getting blank. (Laughs)  10  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Bloodroot.  Bloodroot that grows out in the woods, and     Walnut?  Yes, walnut. We mostly used walnut and bloodroot at that time.  So that would give you some reds and purples or browns?  The bloodroot was mostly orange, kind of an orange color, not really red  but orange. The walnut is kind of light black-brown, or sometimes it  would get darker if you used more walnuts in it. You can also use the  hulls in it to make color.  Was that your first time going to the Art Under the Oaks show?  Yes, I think that was the first time I started going to that show, so I kept  going. (Laughter)  Right, that was a good start. What were some other shows that you liked  to do?  Let   s see. The shows where I won something?  Yes or that you would show your work at?  Mostly every year, we went to the Heritage Center. At the beginning,  mostly every year I would win First Place, which made me happy.  (Laughter)  Oh, wow   I thought,    They like my work. They like my baskets.     Yes, was that during Cherokee Holidays when the Heritage Center had  their show, or was it the Trail of Tears show?  The Trail of Tears.  Okay. When you were winning each year at the Trail of Tears show, too,  that was when that was really a big national show. They got entries from  all over the country during that time. Now, your sister makes baskets,  too, right?  Yes, she does.  11  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Did she learn about the same time as you, or     I think probably about the same time, maybe a little later when she  started entering her baskets.  Did she learn from you, or did she     Yes. (Laughter) But she   d say it   s different.  What was it like? Did you ever compete against each other in shows?  Did you ever have work in the same show?  Yes. I hate to talk about my sister. (Laughs)  That   s fine. I understand. I   ve interviewed other artists who were  siblings, but you did compete in some of the same shows?  Yes.  Who were some basket makers that you admired during that time? You  were winning a lot of shows, but were there a couple of people whose  work you really thought was also good?  At that time, there weren   t that many basket makers like they are now.  There   s a lot of basket makers nowadays. I guess the one that I would  look up to that helped me the most would be my sister-in-law because  she was making baskets way before I was and she was good.  Did you ever get a chance to go to Cherokee, North Carolina?  Yes, we   ve been there. Had the privilege of going back to the homeland.  Did you go with your family, your husband and kids?  No, the first time we went, the Village got together and raised some  money, and we went. We got to go.  That   s wonderful. What was that like?  It was just like, get to thinking that that was their home. Their home.  Now I   m going to cry. You would just think that   s where you came  from, your ancestors came from, and you were standing on the soil  where the ancestors lived. It was wonderful.  Did you get to talk to any basket makers over there?  12  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Yes, I did. I talked to some basket makers, but they used a lot of the flat  reed instead of the kind that we use over here. In the old days, they  would make their own flat reed from the trees out in the woods, in the  old days way before my time. They were pretty, but I think these made  from honeysuckle and commercial reed are prettier to me. (Laughter)  And they used different kinds of splits, didn   t they? Do you have to have  a frame for that honeysuckle? I don   t know what you call it, but the  structure that the honeysuckle goes around, do you use a different kind  of material for that?  You mean before you use to making baskets with it?  Yes, for something to hold up because the honeysuckle is so flexible.  Oh, no, we didn   t use anything. Like I said, to make it like a pattern, like  going round and round with it, we just used our imagination and our  own hands. That reed, when you gather it, it has to be boiled for maybe  about three hours to get it soft enough to get it one by one, to strip it  with your hands and get them clean.  Oh, for the reed.  Yes, for the reed.  You mentioned you only made a few of the reed baskets? Is that right?  Yes, but (what did I say?) buckbrush. They call it buckbrush. It   s a lot  tougher than the honeysuckle. I guess that   s why there weren   t so many  buckbrushes.  So it   s harder to work with, in a way.  It   s harder to work with, and the reed is bigger and tougher. It   s a  tougher reed.  Did you enter the couple of buckbrush baskets that you made? Did you  enter those in shows?  I don   t think I ever entered one, but people liked them because they were  different     Because they were different.  13  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird     so they bought them. I sold them.  Oh, I see, okay. Did you have to charge a little more because it was  tough to work with?  Yes, you have to charge a little more for the natural reed that you use,  that you go out and gather yourself. You have to fix it up, and there   s a  lot of work to it. Some people don   t realize how much work there is to it,  but there is. There is a lot of work to it.  Right. I know that you won, like in 2005 you won in the contemporary  basket category. You had a piece called Indian Summer, I read. I  wonder if you could explain that basket to us, first of all, what it looked  like.  Let   s see. I remember we finished a basket and was going to enter it. I  thought they preferred for it to have a title, but nowadays they enter  them, and some of them don   t have no titles to them. I guess it mattered  more then than it does now.  Oh, that   s interesting. So you would title quite a few of your baskets  because that was what people did.  Yes. Then we would think and think what we could call it.  Did you help each other with ideas?  Yes. (Laughter)  I noticed you   ll say,    We went to a show.    Did you travel with other  basket makers quite a bit, then, the other women who were selling?  Well, we didn   t go to far, maybe like we went to Tulsa quite a bit, them  shows over there.  Oh, okay, at galleries or at the fairgrounds, or     Craft shows is what we would call it.  Tulsa Indian Arts Festival, was that going on?  Yes.  Would you have a booth together, or did you have your own booth?  Like the rest of the other basket makers? No. Each one of us would have  14  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  our own booths.  But Tulsa was a good market for your baskets?  Yes.  How would you describe the difference between a traditional basket and  a contemporary basket?  How could you tell? The natural reed, when it   s stripped, it   s got little-bitty     it   s not smooth all the way around like this commercial reed is.  It   s got little-bitty, I would just say bumps, I guess, on the honeysuckle  after it   s cleaned up and     Roots.     roots sticking   you can let them stick out to make sure they know it   s  natural. We used to cut all them roots off before, but then we started  leaving them on because they look more natural. They could tell it was a  natural reed while this was just smooth all the way around, didn   t have  nothing on them, just commercial.  Were you one of the first who kind of started putting acorns on top of  your baskets?  I just thought a little decoration from the woods would look different or  better or something. I started using acorns.  And it caught on. Everybody liked the idea.  Everybody caught on with it. (Laughter)  What was your either most favorite or maybe the thing you didn   t like  about shows when you were doing shows? What did you enjoy or what  didn   t you enjoy?  It seemed like it was enjoyable to meet people, different people, and talk  to people and how they would admire your work. That made you feel  good. (Laughs) I don   t know about what I didn   t like. I just liked to go. I  always liked to go them and enjoyed myself.  Did your family come to shows with you, the kids and     Yes, sometimes. Sometimes we did. For a while, I went by myself. I set  up by myself, and mostly my sister, my sister-in-law or brother would be  sitting next to me with their own crafts and stuff. Then later on, Lisa  15  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  started getting interested in it, so she went with me and started going  with me. When I got crippled, she   s the one that usually takes me around  everywhere.  Did you give any workshops in making baskets?  No. I didn   t go to very many places where I demonstrated, but I went to  a couple of places I know where they asked you if you could go into this  place and demonstrate making baskets. I know I been to maybe two or  three, not very many.  Where were they?  Where? I think     Broken Arrow?  Broken Arrow was one, yes. Stilwell, somewhere in Stilwell. I don   t  know just what it was. I   m forgetful, and I can   t remember the other  places.  Is there a type of basket that you wanted to learn how to make that you  never got around to because you were busy selling your other ones?  Was there ever a kind of basket that you never got around to making?  No, I guess I never thought about that. Just doing what I had to work  with and did that.  When you were doing a basket for a show, for a competition, what did  you focus on?  You have to really make it smooth and as nice as you could. (Laughs)  To make it as nice as you could. Sometimes some reed would be bigger  than the other smaller reed, and you would try to match the sizes of it to  make it smooth-looking. It would make it look better than just using any  kind.  That was with the natural reed.  You would pick out the same sizes or try to pick out the same sizes to  use. When you was entering something, you had to do that.  Right. So did you sell quite a bit out of   well, it   s probably hard to sell  out of the home. Probably hard for people to come out here, so mostly at  shows, I guess.  16  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  No, not too much at home. Usually, what we had, we   d take to shops or  wait until a show was going on.  Cherokee Nation gift shop and some of the other gift shops. Who has one  of your baskets that you   re most proud they have your basket?  I wish I could remember the names that went overseas.  Oh, how fun.  I think Wilma Mankiller had several. I think she had some vases that I  had woven over. She had some clay beads that I had made out of clay,  like this one right here. This is clay. I know Bobbie Gail   s got some.  Former Chief  Chad  Smith   s wife.  Yes, I was proud of that.  Museums.  Several museums.  Yes. When somebody would come along and buy a basket, it would go  to some museum. One went to somewhere in Texas, somewhere in a  museum back there.  Did you have one go to the Smithsonian, National Museum of the  American Indian?  I don   t think so, not there.  When did you start to get the idea for weaving over vases?  Just later on after I started making baskets. I thought they looked pretty,  and you could put water in it and put real flowers on it if they wanted to  use it for a vase for flowers. People liked them. They bought them, and I  used to sell them. One about that size, I   ve sold some for about a  hundred and fifty dollars. I thought that was good. (Laughs)  Yes. With your woven baskets, were you happy if they were used for  something, too, or did you think of them just mainly as a work of art to  set on the table?  No, I didn   t mind, if they knew who it came from. I didn   t mind how  they used it. (Laughter)  17  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  So when Lisa started learning to make baskets, how did you handle  that?  I was proud. I was proud that somebody got interested in it and was  going to carry on when I couldn   t.  She already knew about shows.  Yes. I   m proud of her. She   s getting better than I am. (Laughs)  Are there any grandkids that are interested, too?  Yes, Lisa   s girls, they know how to weave, but they just haven   t gotten  into it that much. My other daughter can. She knows how to weave, but  she   s...too busy. (Laughter)  It takes time, doesn   t it?  Yes, it takes time. They know how.  How long would it take you to finish a basket?  For me, it takes longer, but I   ll talk about Lisa. She can finish one in a  day. She starts one on one day, and she finishes the next day. For me, it  takes longer than that.  So when you were showing, did you only work on one basket at a time,  or would you work on several at a time?  Just one. I would just use the reed that I had and show them how it was  done. If it was a small one, we could finish it in a little while, but if it  was a bigger one, it would take longer than that. We usually just started  with the small ones when we were demonstrating.  Right. So talking a little bit more, I guess, about your process, how did  you get your ideas for baskets? Would you sometimes kind of wake up in  the morning, and you might have an idea, or you   d be outside walking  around, and you   d get an idea? How did you get your ideas?  Usually when you   re in bed, I think, that   s mostly when you would think  about how you could make it look different or better or what kind of  decorations you could put on there, be thinking about that. The hardest  part was thinking up the title. (Laughter)  Right, right. So did you write things down when you were laying in bed,  or did you just keep it in your head?  18  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  No, I didn   t write it down. I just kept it in my head.  Then the next day, you   d go to work. Did you prefer working during the  day, or did you like to kind of work later in the evening?  I worked during the day because there was nothing much else I could do.  When I could work longer and when my hands were better, I used to  work until way in the night sometimes.  If you had a show coming up.  Yes, if I had a show coming up, I   d work extra hard. (Laughter)  How many baskets   I know it depends on size, but how many would you  try to have at a show?  We would try to have about a tableful of baskets, sometimes more than  that. Now we don   t do so many.  I know you mentioned that a lot of times, even with the buckbrush or the  honeysuckle, you might buy the natural materials, but a few times you  got them yourself. I   m wondering if it   s gotten kind of harder as the  weather is changing and things are changing in the land. Is it kind of  getting harder to get those natural materials?  It   s getting scarcer, I think. Wouldn   t you, Lisa?  Yes.  You just have to find a place or see a place where there might be some,  and then you would go out there. If it   s on somebody   s land, you have to  get their permission, if it was all right to go out and get it.  How did you sign your baskets     Sign?     or did you not? Was there any way of   like a potter can put their  name on the bottom of a pot.  No, I don   t remember signing them, but once in a while somebody  would ask if I could sign my name at the bottom or somewhere, and we  just used ink pen or something like that. (Laughs)  Did you like doing that, or did you feel like     19  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Oh, I didn   t think nothing of it. I just did it. It was all right.  She had pictures taken with them.  You were happy to do it for them. The fine work was your signature,  wasn   t it? (Laughs) That   s really nice work. Looking back over the time  that you   ve made baskets when you were making and selling, was there  kind of a fork in the road where you thought to yourself,    Well, maybe I  shouldn   t really spend my time making these   ? Was there ever a fork in  the road for you, or did you always just know,    I like making baskets  and I   m going to do it   ?  That   s what I would say. I just like doing it. I like doing it. Of course,  there   s other things, the usual things to be doing, and I   d do that, but as  much as I could, I was making baskets. (Laughs) I just liked to.  Did you have any low points when you were making baskets and selling  baskets, and you got discouraged?  You would get a little discouraged whenever you went to a show and  there wasn   t too much business, not very many people buying or  interested. Just a little. It didn   t bother too much.  The next one would be better. You were planning on that. How about  another high point? Going back to Cherokee, North Carolina, was a  high point in a way, and it was a moving experience. Was there another  high point in your career, another moment that stands out that you  really had special     Yes, we met some older elders there that was good to talk to, and  they   ve been making baskets for a long time. It was good visiting with  them because they talked Cherokee, but they sounded a little different  than the way we sound. Had to pay pretty close attention to what they  were saying before you understood them. It   s a little different. It sounds  a little different than the way we talk. It was just good going back.  And you went twice, right? Once with the Village? Did you go twice?  Yes, the first time is when we raised that money to go, and all of the  Village workers went. The next time we just went on our own. We went,  I think, three more times after that. Every year in September, we would  go. That   s when they would have their celebration up there, just all  different things going on. That   s when we would go, in October, and it  was just enjoyable to be there. The mountains, I love the mountains.  20  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  So that became an annual thing for a while. Is there anything we   ve  forgotten to talk about that you   d like to add before we look at your  baskets?  I don   t know. I   ll probably be saying that. I   ll be saying    I wished I had  told her this. I wished I had told her that,    later on. (Laughs) But I can   t  think of anything right now. Seems like everything is pretty much  covered.  Covered, okay. We haven   t talked about your designation as a Living   National  Treasure by Cherokee Nation. How did you first find out?  There was a fellow worker in that Village. He was the canoe maker in  the Village, and he only had one arm. Something happened to him when  he was younger. He told me that,    I   m going to nominate you for the  National Treasures.    It started from him. He went and gave them my  name, and now it   s   . When I got it, that was in    96, I think.  In    96. Was the program very old? Had it been in existence very long?  Not too long, not very long. I heard from somebody that Wilma  Mankiller had thought up the idea. I   d heard it, but I don   t really know  for sure if that was who.  So when you were given that award, was there a dinner? How did they  celebrate that?  They would announce it, when it was going to be, and a lot of people  would come to it.  A banquet.  Yes, a banquet.  And then the museum probably has at least a couple of your baskets,  right, Cherokee National Museum?  I think so. I don   t know how many places have my baskets, but I know  they   re here and there. I don   t know just where they are.  Right. They   ve gone all over the world, like you said.  She got her award with Tommy Lee Jones. He got an award at the same  time. They were together at this banquet.  Oh, that   s neat. All right, well, we   re going to take a look at your basket  21  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  a little more closely, which is here on the couch and just beautiful. Lena,  you want to tell us about this basket? It   s the one that you   ve kept, I  guess, here. Is it yours? Is it one that you kept all these years, or     No. This isn   t mine. (Laughs)  Okay, this is one of Lisa   s.  No, she made it. She give it to me as a gift.  Oh, okay. That   s how you kept it. You gave it away   And when we get interviewed, we use that because I don   t have any in  my house. (Laughter)  Well, it   s beautiful. In the dyes that you talked about, is there some  walnut there and some bloodroot?  I think that brown is walnut, and the orange is bloodroot.  Can you talk a little bit about the top of the basket?  We made that knob where it would be easier to pick up the lid if they  wanted to look inside to see what it looks like, or if they wanted to store  something in it, they can do that. You can make some lids that don   t  have those knobs on there, too, but they would be harder to pick up.  They would be flat.  Yes, that   s a beautiful top or knob because I   ve seen them where they   re  hard to pick up. It   s just big enough and the shape and everything. Is  this one of the ones where you were thinking about it one night, the  design sort of came to you?  I guess. I don   t remember. (Laughter) The idea of putting those acorns  and decorating that little bit came to me later, and just started doing that.  I would make little-bitty corns out of this smaller reed, and then I would  decorate the basket knob and put the little corns around it, too.  Oh, how delicate. Did you dye some of the   did it have color in the corn,  or was it just the natural color?  Mostly yellow and the dark, almost like purple. It looked like  strawberries on there, but they were corn. They called it some kind of  corn. I forgot what they were called. Almost round berries.  Talk about the acorns a bit. You polish them, don   t you? I mean, they   re  22  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Lisa Blackbird  Blackbird  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Lisa Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  Little Thunder  Blackbird  real shiny. They   re prettier than the ones I pick up.  What do I with them? I think just a wet cloth or something like that. Just  cleaning them real good.  It   s just beautiful. Lisa, you mentioned there was a way that Lena sort of  signed her baskets in a sense.  Yes. People would want the signature, so the only way we knew of was  to have a picture with her and the basket, proving that she   s the one that  made the basket. The colors on this basket is what she called Cherokee  colors.  That   s nice to know, that particular combination. I don   t know if we   ve  really talked about even maybe a design that was kind of your favorite  design, or did it just change from basket to basket?  Your chain.  I don   t remember.  At the top, the chain. That   s yours.  The design on the basket?  Not the lid. The basket.  Okay, I see it. The one on the top there. That   s one of your mom   s  trademark designs. That   s just really neat. All right, well thank you so  much for your time today.  Well, thank you for coming. I hope I   I have trouble talking. I don   t  really know how to talk. (Laughs)  Oh, no, you were just great.  Glad to see you.  -------  -------
