 Finchum  Lee  Today is September 3, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library. We   re doing an interview for the  Muskogee African American Heritage Oral History Project, part of our  Spotlighting Oklahoma series. Today we   re in the Muskogee Public  Library and we   ll be talking with Lansing Lee. Thank you for coming  today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your youth, beginning  with where you were born.  Well, I was born here in Muskogee, Oklahoma. I was actually born at  home, which was the norm around that time. Midwives were the  preference in most black homes.  In what year?  1953. January fifteenth. A very good day. (Laughter)  Probably cold, I would think.  It was cold, but it was a good day.  Do you have brothers and sisters?  Sure. I had one older brother and three sisters.  Where did you fall?  I was the middle child.  5  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  And what did each of your parents do for a living?  My father worked in factories at that time and my mother was a  domestic worker.  And then your grandparents on each side?  Well my grandparents on my father   s side owned a small grocery store. I  don   t really know a lot about my grandparents on my mother   s side.  Were they born and raised here in Muskogee too or did they come from  other places?  They came from other places. My father actually came from Missouri  and his whole family moved down here amidst mixed stories of what   s  going on in Missouri. My mother   s parents, I think, were basically here.  They lived in a place right outside of Muskogee called Sanders Chapel, a  small community that is still there. I guess there are not that many  people, as you can tell. Most of the small communities, they all migrate  to the city for work, especially after the economy changed and there  wasn   t a basic farm community anymore.  Which elementary school did you go to here in Muskogee?  Douglas Elementary School. One of the best. Grades one through six.  And then?  And then I went to Sadler Junior High School, seventh through ninth.  Spent two years at Manual Training High School and then became part  of the first integrated class in Muskogee in 1970-   71.  You graduated in        71.  Your elementary school was one of the best?  It was one of the best. My fifth grade teacher was teaching diagramming  compound, complex sentences at the time and had us in great debates  about whether a prepositional phrase was used as an adjective clause or  an adverb clause. So by the time I got to junior high school, you know,  the kids from Douglas that were in my grade, and we integrated with all  the other grade schools from black grade schools, it was shocking to us  that they didn   t already know this stuff. We just had some great teachers  at Douglas.  6  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  And how close was it to your home? Close enough to walk?  Less than a couple of blocks. It was good. That time was good there.  Did your teachers interact with your parents very much?  Yes, well of course you   re talking about back in the sixties and so  integration was not a popular idea at the time. There was a separate but  equal concept. So our teachers lived in our neighborhoods. Our  preachers lived in our neighborhoods. Most of the successful black  businessmen lived in our neighborhoods. There was no such thing as  living on the other side of town. I guess that was not even thought about  at that time. It was a good inter-mix of poor and, I guess, middle class  and so called    upper-class    blacks in the same neighborhood.  In high school did you have a favorite teacher?  One of them was Dr. James Christian, who was the high school biology  and chemistry teacher, but it wasn   t necessarily because of his teaching.  I mean he was a tough teacher, and I always enjoyed that because I like  competition, but he did things outside of the classroom that helped mold  us into a different type of person. He was a sponsor of something called  the    High-Y.    The High-Y taught things like political formats, how to  structure a bill, how to understand parliamentary procedure and use it in  our meetings. We took trips. In fact, the first trip I had ever taken out of  the state, he was the sponsor. We went on a trip with the High-Y to  Galveston, Corpus Christi, Houston, got a chance to see SeaWorld, the  Gulf of Mexico; real exciting. So basically one of the things that helped  out was that he showed us how to organize ourselves to do fundraising  to make that trip possible and then to reward ourselves for the efforts  that were done by being able to orchestrate a trip of this nature with  about sixty kids.  Fifteen, sixteen year olds or around there?  Yes. And of course, there were parents who volunteered to go on the trip  with us and some of the other teachers who worked with us. So we saw  our teachers, not only during the day at school, but for activities on  weekends, activities after school when we were having our meetings that  were part of the community structure. It was kind of a different world  than it is today.  And your neighborhood today, how does it compare to back then?  I live in a more affluent neighborhood now. We have a bigger house. We  have a nice manicured lawn. Those types of things. But I really don   t  7  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  know my next door neighbor on the other side or anybody from the real  community other than to wave at them as we   re coming and going. The  neighborhoods back then, you knew everybody and they knew you. One  of the things that was popular about the neighborhood was that if we got  in trouble at school, at church, in the park, our parents were going to  know about it before we got home. Neighbors had not only the green  light to take care of the situation, but they basically exercised it. So if  there was an adult in the community and there was a fight in the park,  that adult woman could come over and whip both of the kids, and we  couldn   t really say anything about it. We couldn   t talk back to her  because we already knew she was going to be calling our parents before  we got there. It was one of those things that kind of kept things in check.  It   s not that way now. There seems to be a different situation, basically,  because we   ve got more parents who are not that much older than the  children they   re raising and so there   s a lot less respect in the  neighborhoods and because we don   t really know each other like we did  before. There seems to be a tendency to not want someone else to  discipline our children.  Is there a neighborhood school within walking distance of your current  house?  My current house now? Oh, no. The nearest school from me is  Muskogee High School and it   s a couple of miles away. The  neighborhood structure is a lot different.  Has downtown changed much?  Oh yeah.  How has it changed?  Well, when I was a grade schooler, I can remember (we didn   t have a  car at the time) walking to town with my mother and seeing the little  water fountains that said,    white    and    colored.    Going to a laundry mat  and seeing a sign that says,    Whites Only Beyond This Point.    Not  being able to go into some stores at all or being very careful to be in one  section of the store only. You know, it   s a lot different now. Some say  there   s more freedom now. There   s more freedom to interact with other  people. More freedom to get around and go buy whatever you want from  whoever you want. Of course, that   s an economic difference more so  than a racial difference. The tension back then was high, but it was one  of those where this is the way it is, you stay in your place, they stay in  theirs and there   s no friction. Now there   s more of a covert type of deal.  Racism still exists here. It just doesn   t have the signs and all of the  grandeur that it had in the 1960s.  8  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Was it just with whites or Indians too?  Well, and this might sound strange, but from my perspective and the  perspective that my parents had, anybody that wasn   t black was white.  They seemed to get along, they seemed to have a lot of ease with one  another. It just was blacks that they were not comfortable with.  So are you married?  Yes, I am.  Children?  Four children.  Are they grown?  All of them now.  Do they live here in Muskogee?  Only my youngest son. He just graduated from high school last year and  he has an internship with OG E and so he   s working out at their power  plant and taking online courses for electrical engineering. He   ll be here  for at least a couple more years while he   s still in that process. My oldest  daughter works as a bank manager for Bank of America in Chesapeake,  Virginia. Her sister, which were about a year later, works for Corps of  Engineers. Right now she   s in Afghanistan. She   s a contractor for  housing and inventory. She   s not in the military. She   s a civilian  contractor working through Corps of Engineers. And my oldest son is in  Omaha, Nebraska.  Very much scattered then.  Very much so. He doesn   t have any anticipation of coming back to  Muskogee, other than to visit.  That was my next question.  And if I leave, he probably won   t even remember Muskogee.  Is your wife from here as well?  Oh yeah. Yes, she   s a lifelong Muskogeean. She left to go to Texas to  teach at Garland Public Schools for awhile, but is now teaching, and has  been teaching for the last five or six years, at Cherokee Elementary  9  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  School here in Muskogee. She loves first grade. More power to her. I  was a secondary education teacher. I don   t know how the elementary  schools are able to teach a child to read and to go through all those. I   d  much rather get them at the age where they   re already reasoning and  putting together their own thoughts and can do things with a lot less  attention.  While we   re on that topic, tell us how you got to college.  (Laughs) Well by the time I reached the twelfth grade I was pretty much  fed up with the high school system. I thought it was perfunctory. I felt  that it was just wasting my time, keeping me off the job market and I  decided I wasn   t going. Just as soon as I graduated I   d be able to get a  job and start my own life independently. Well, I came home one evening  from school and, to my surprise, I had my high school principal, my fifth  grade teacher, my seventh grade teacher, counselor, and my pastor at my  house. Basically when I came in, at seventeen years old, they had me  back down in grade school again, telling me what I would and would not  do and that I did not have the right not to go to college. I was obligated  to do so. They basically decided amongst them that my fifth grade  teacher, Mrs. Hattie Schoats, was going to take me to Langston  University and go ahead and make me enroll.  So the next week she did as she said. She took me to Langston, walking  me through the enrollment process like I was still in the fifth grade. I  was a little angry, but I had better sense than to argue with an adult and  low and behold I thank them every day of my life for that one exchange  of ideas they gave me at that time because college changed the direction  in what I was going to be able to do. I didn   t really have an  understanding of college before that time. I was the first in my family to  go and it was an exciting experience that really prepared me for the  world ahead.  And they chose Langston.  Well at that time, even though integration had taken place and a lot of  black students were going to OU, OSU, Langston was still the school of  preference for black teachers. Most of my teachers had graduated from  Langston and so it was their Alma Mater. They felt strongly about it and  felt that I should go, too. And so I went. I was very successful at  Langston. During my first two weeks, I was president of several  organizations and was able to exert quite a bit of influence starting my  freshman year. So it was very positive. It gave me a new lease and a new  energy in the educational system itself.  What was your major?  10  Lee  Finchum  Lee  I started out majoring in business, but because I was a poet and was  starting to do a lot of presentations, I was convinced to become an  English major and really enjoyed it to the point of where by the time I  was a junior, I had decided that I would teach English for the rest of my  natural life. It was exciting. It was a way to really hone my ideas and be  able to express them and that experience has helped me with everything  I   ve done since then. When I first started teaching English, my first  contract was  9,600 a year. I could have pumped gas and done that.  Here in Muskogee?  No, it was in Boley, Oklahoma. It   s a small black town of about 500  people. On the rodeo days, it swells to about 10,000 people. It was a real  experience for me. In fact, it gave me some major lessons about people  and how we can really have differences of opinion. In that small black  town   because I had gone to a black college and we were during the  period of the James Brown   s    I   m Black and I   m Proud    and the    right  on    types of situations where there was a lot of pride in being black, I go  to a small black town to teach English. I thought we would all have unity  here and everybody was pushing to give the best possible education for  blacks because we were in a situation where it was unique. At my first  teacher   s meeting, the superintendent says,    If you can teach these kids  in Chilesville just to sit up and be quiet, you   ve done a great job.    Now  Chilesville was a little bitty town outside of Boley. Real small. But they  were treating them like they were second class citizens. This was strange  to me and it was almost akin to saying,    Nothing good can come out of  Nazareth.     I went to the superintendent and said,    How can you make a statement  like that? You don   t know these kids. You don   t know which one of  them is going to be the powerhouse, the next lawyer or doctor in here.  To say something like that is just uncalled for.    But that was his opinion  and he ran his school like he was running his household. The only  opinion that mattered was his. So I wanted to prove him wrong. I went  into my class with the attitude of    Listen, I don   t know any of you here.  This is my first year. I don   t have any relatives here. So let   s get one  thing understood. Everybody has a chance to make an A. The person  who will stop that is you. Now, I   m not going to listen to what the other  teachers have to say about you. I   m going to let you make the  impression for yourself. But we   re going to start off from day one  realizing that you   ve got a chance here.    It was probably one of the best  years of my life.  The thing that excited me most was when I could look into a kid   s eyes  and they say    I got it.    Because English is repetitious. Once you learn  the concept that one time, it   s with you for the rest of your life. If you  11  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  learn a noun is a name, person, place or thing in the third grade, it   s the  same thing when you   re a college senior. You may learn more of the  definition, person, place or thing can be some quality or ideal, but that  concept stays with you and you will be able to get past all the other  things. You don   t have to relearn new techniques. It   s not like science  where new theories come about because of new information. It lays the  foundation for the ways that you will deal with the world. I like that. I  like the idea of explaining to my students,    If you can master the  language, you will master the land. Be good at both writing and  speaking skills. It   ll take you a long way.     What grade was this?  Ninth through twelfth.  You taught all?  Oh yeah, ninth through twelfth, plus speech and drama.  Did most of them get As then?  No. There were quite a few that got them, but you know it   s a classroom.  We basically knew that everybody would not be on the same level, but  those that were very low, such a confidence came over them that brought  their grade levels up. To show that just a change in your attitude toward  them would make a difference, I challenged the other English teachers  for a contest among my students and theirs to showcase what we were  doing and we seemed to be very successful. But again, some teachers, I  guess, have the idea that,    I put out the information. If you got it, fine. If  you didn   t, it   s not my fault. It   s yours. You should have gotten it.    But I  don   t feel like you   ve taught anything unless the student receives it,  unless they understand it. Unless they walk out there with a different  sense of confidence and understanding about what they have to deal with  than before they came. So  it was a  good learning experience.  Was that some of the philosophy that Manual Training had?  Oh yeah. Yes. You know, the opportunity for success or failure lies  within your own hands and don   t let anybody else determine what your  future   s going to be. You can do it.  So how long did you stay there?  I stayed there for about six years. Fortunately, when I first came I took  the position of a retiring teacher who was writing their Title I and Title  VII grants and so my expectation was to do those same things. I didn   t  12  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  know anything about grant writing at that time, so I struggled. I read  everything I could to be at least competitive and I started getting better  and better with our grants, getting more money. My competitors from  around this area started getting less. So I came to Muskogee for an  interview that I took because Dr. Christian was the secondary education  director at that time and I had had several calls from Muskogee to come  and interview and I just wasn   t interested. I liked what I was doing in  this small town. When Dr. Christian called I said,    Okay.    They doubled  my salary to come and do the grants at the education center here.  You gave up teaching then?  I gave up teaching. Yes, because I didn   t have to teach. I monitored the  grants and became the director of grant programs.  How long did you do that? Or are you still doing that?  Well, no, I did it for about three years and was real successful at it  except I felt they kind of corrupted some of the moneys of the grants. So  I went back to school. I went back to OSU and then I went to work for  public housing. I didn   t think I would ever go back in education at the  time. I definitely wasn   t going to write grants because I felt like I was  getting money for people to misuse. And so I worked for public housing  for about five years and wound up helping to write some grants for  public housing because once they find out that you know something  about it, you kind of get pushed in that position. I worked for the state   s  Arts Council for a couple of years. Then I basically decided that I  wanted a business of my own and I was determined to do it. What I did  was while I was working for public housing, I saw an ad in the paper for  the Army Reserves that would allow me to get a  2500 bonus. They  couldn   t fire me from my job while I was in training for this, they would  have to give me my job back and I would only have to work one  weekend out of the month and two weeks out of the year for summer  camp. I said,    I can use this money to start my own business.     And so I went and took the training and when I came back I opened up  an income tax service. I took the H R Block tax course. There was  something called the Consumer Report   s Tax Course, National  Federated Tax Course   I was trying to get all of those certificates so  people would say,    Hey, this guy really knows what he   s doing.    I had  about fifteen customers that year and not all of them paid me. Some of  those customers the next year came back and wanted to do the same  thing that I did the first year and said,    As soon as I get my refund  check, I   ll bring you money.    So that was a hard lesson to learn. To  make up for the money that I was missing, I started taking a lot of  training courses with the military; personnel management, personnel  13  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  actions, personnel records. As I got more courses in, the commander  from the unit that I was in at that time was influential in having me work  full time for the unit as a Unit Administrator. So as Unit Administrator, I  did facility management, physical security, payroll, personnel records  and I worked for them for about sixteen years. I got my knee hurt in  Desert Storm, playing basketball (laughs), and so I had to leave them.  Basically while I was in the process of transitioning from the military, a  friend of mine came by with a grant from the city of Muskogee and said,     Hey, I got a contract to do this for  5,000. It   s a Championship Cities  Renewal grant. If they don   t get the renewal, they   re going to lose out on  a quite a bit of money, but I don   t know how to write a grant.    So we got  together and put together about a 400 page grant in about a week. A lot  of overtime and we got the  5,000. So I said,    Well, I work here all  month, I take in about  2,800. Worked on this a week and I got about   5,000? I   m quitting     (Laughs) So I went into grant writing and haven   t  looked back. Haven   t looked back at all.  I   ve enjoyed what I   ve been able to do with the grant writing here  because I can see some of the fruits of my labor. You know, when I look  at the Senior Citizen Nutrition Program in Taft or in Muskogee the  Martin Luther King Center, I had a direct hand in that. The new police  cars at the Muskogee Police or the Muskogee County Sherriff   s office  that drive around, I had a direct hand in that, in making these things  happen. The Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization grants  that I brought in people to deal with the support for those individuals, I  have a direct hand in making some things happen and it was important to  me. So I love what I do now, even though I still do income taxes. I work  as a reference librarian part time. I still do the grants for a lot of small  cities and towns and law enforcement agencies and some nonprofits and  I   m director of the Martin Luther King Center. So it   s multitasking.  When do you sleep?  (Laughs) Everything can be done. You just have to manage your time.  I   ve enjoyed it and I   ve basically been satisfied with the idea of knowing  that it   s possible to do anything if you   re really going to set your mind to  it. When people say,    I can   t find a job,    I say,    Well, that seems almost  impossible to me that you can   t find a job when I can do so many of  these things so something   s wrong here. Either you   re not really trying  to find a job or you   re looking in the wrong places.    So I guess my  philosophy is,    When you can   t find one, create one.    Anything is  possible, especially when you   re in an information age where you have a  computer and the internet.  And your philosophy originally started with parents or grandparents or  14  Lee  Finchum  Lee  teachers?  I guess it was a conglomerate of all these things hitting me at one time  and then reading philosophy, so many different philosophies, and  melting and merging all these things. I wrote a poem that basically  spelled out my philosophy of life and I usually use a lot of poetry in  situations. It   s called    Some of Us Know.    If you   ve got a quick second,  I   d like to do it because it does sum up the things for me.  Please do.  It says:  Some of us know  that everything in life  is on a dual plane.  There   s sunshine and rain,  joy and pain,  hot and cold,  black and white,  wrong and right.  And some of us know  how to control the flow  of the pendulum swing  and can adjust our lives  through accommodating  either side of what the future brings.  Some of us know  and some of us don   t know.  Some of us know that love and hate  are different degrees  of the same measuring stick  and that friends can become enemies  in a single flick of an eye.  Those of us who know, know,  why it has nothing to do  with predestined fate.  A change in attitude directly relates  to positive power set in motion  by forces some will never understand.  And there are those I am told  who never take control  15  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  of the powers in the whirlwind of chance.  But there   s no such thing as chance.  Only time and circumstance  and here one we hold.  Some of us know  and some of us don   t know.  Some of us know how to read the signs  and determine the differences in mankind.  Well it   s easy to distinguish  the separation lines  between the rich and the poor,  the haves and have nots,  the actors and the watchers,  the beggars and the takers,  the poets and the fakers.  Some of us know  and some of us don   t know.  And those of us who know  have come to understand  that everything that happens  in the lifetime of a man  is a direct result of his own ideas.  Poverty or luxury, excellent health or misery,  power, success, happiness, fame,  loneliness, or hopelessness  are all from the same source.  Superficial issues of age, sex, or race  will never determine a lifestyle at stake,  the power of your thoughts  determine your fate.  Some of us know and  some of us don   t know.  Don   t know.  Don   t know.     Excellent.  It   s how I feel. There   s very little that separates me. It   s not the color of  your skin or your age or the side of town that you were brought up in.  It   s the way we think.  When did you write that?  16  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Oh, twenty years ago.  Have you changed it any or has it been the same for the most part?  It   s always been the same and one of the things that happened to me  when I was really young was that my memory skills were always good. I  can pull a poem back from thirty years ago or ten days ago, depends on  the situation. It   s only written down so other people can see it, but for  me it   s coming back with the same feelings I had when I wrote it.  Did your parents do much reading and that sort of thing?  Everybody on my father   s side looks like they were a poet. My older  brother, in fact he was fifteen years older than me so he was gone by the  time I was done with grade school. He was apparently doing poetry in  the Army, hadn   t learn anything about it. I started doing poetry in the  second grade because I wanted to win a cake for a Halloween program  that my second grade teacher had. The person that wrote the best poem  would get the cake. I wanted it, so I did it. But when he finally got back  home (he didn   t stay with us, he had his own place) he saw a marquee  on the civic center   s sign that said    Poetry Tonight.    So he went down to  find out who was doing the poetry and it was me. (Laughter) And so  when he told me he did poetry, I was just shocked. I sat down and  listened to him and I was just overwhelmed.  I had an aunt that was ninety-six years old and my daughter, my second  daughter who went to Afghanistan, she writes poetry too. So we were  going to visit the ninety-six year old, we were bragging about how well  we do it, and we sat down and listened to her and we just got blown  away. She came up with this poem that she had written about faith and it  was awe inspiring. I guess it was something we all did, but nobody in  the family really talked about it as some big deal, it was just something  you do. It   s expressing your thoughts. It   s an outlet, you know.  Creativity. Do you do music, too?  Well, when I first went to Langston, I used to play the piano, sing, do  poetry, act. I received several awards for acting when I was in high  school and in college, but I couldn   t play the piano as well as most of the  people that were there. They were really good. But my personality was  strong, so most of the time they would let me play when they should  have been doing it and this occurred to me,    Hey, we want the best show  we   ve got. You can play this piano better than I can. You need to be  right here.    So I became more of an orchestrator that put programs  together.  17  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  I was a part of a thing called the Langston Show my second semester at  Langston and began a deal where we had poetry, drama, music and  dance, and it gave me a chance to just really see a lot. We recruited for  Langston for about six months. We basically went to eight or nine states  around Oklahoma, junior colleges and high schools, doing performances  and basically gaining student   s interest in Langston, getting them to fill  out applications for Langston and those types of things. A fun deal and  another good learning experience while I was there.  And you said you went to OSU for awhile?  Yes. I was disgusted with grant writing here at the education center  because some things had happened, how some money seemed to just get  filtered into places that weren   t the grants that I wrote. And so I went  back to OSU and was going to work on my master   s and was doing  pretty well until they called me for a job at public housing that gave me  so much more money and I said,    Oh, I can do this at night.    I enjoyed  public housing for some time and learned some new skills there. I guess  everything that I   ve done culminated into what I do today.  The King Center is no fluke. It   s a situation that gives me a chance to  give back to the community. It gives me a chance to write grants that  have some significance. I just got a grant for a Personal Financial  Literacy program at the King Center that   s being run by one of my good  friends who shares my philosophy about what we need in this  community. We have too many people who are basically walking around  with no checking account, a messed up checking account for one reason  or another. When they get their checks, they go to some check cashing  place which charges them. They spend their money right out of their  pocket and then their money goes so fast, they don   t know what  happened to it. At the end of the month, they   re broke and trying to find  other resources again. We need to break this cycle. We need to help  people have a much better understanding of money management, of  being able to control their finances, being able to forecast and save,  number one. So I feel very strongly about that.  I   m getting ready to put together another grant for some life skills  programs for fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. I wrote the grant for the  Senior Nutrition Program where we feed, for free, seniors who are sixty-plus,  two times a week right now. We plan to move it up to at least five  times a week within the next year. It   s little things like that that make so  much more of a difference.  And those types of things weren   t needed back in your youth so much as  they are now?  18  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Well they may have been needed, we just didn   t recognize it and some  things may have been happening and because of my youth and my  immaturity, I didn   t realize it. As I   m getting older I see a whole lot of  things differently than what I did when I was a youth. In fact, the way I  raised my son, I thought that I was going to be so much different than  my mother. I won   t be the disciplinarian she was. (Laughs) But I see  myself with my mother   s words coming out of my mouth when I talk to  him, whenever we have discussions about who his friends should be and  shouldn   t be, what he needs to do with his income and how to prepare  for life itself and it seems like she   s talking through me. So I don   t  know. It   s a new world as I   ve gotten older.  You   re still teaching.  Yeah.  Just in a different venue.  And I do some tutoring even now. I   ve got two young ladies who are  working on their master   s who are having a problem with basic  composition. I teach English grammar to them so they can prepare for  the GMAT and other basic courses, which is exciting, too.  Something that Muskogee High is not doing much     They   re doing the best they can. Everything cannot be done within the  school. If the community bears some responsibility for what happens    I  do think that it   s probably tougher in the classroom with a lot of  disruptions. I get the option of,    Hey, if you   re offering a disruption  here, I don   t have to do this and you don   t have to be here. We can close  this down right now. But if you   re going to be here, then we   re dealing  with this on a different level. There are no disciplinary problems in  here.    So you want it or you don   t.  What do you see for Muskogee in say the next ten to twenty years?  Well, actually I   m optimistic. Muskogee did something I never thought  would happen. We had a situation where we had a race for the mayor  and the more experienced candidate, an older man that I really liked as  an individual, was beaten three to one by a nineteen-year-old. So we  have a nineteen-year-old mayor. But the nineteen-year-old mayor is  insightful, creative, and very intelligent with a demeanor that I probably  would not have had at nineteen years old. That demeanor is one where  he can listen to the criticism, smile it off and still work his plan.  (Laughs) I probably would have been upset by all the controversy that  goes along with that because politics is really not a good game. But I see  19  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  Lee  Finchum  the city changing, looking for something new, looking for new  leadership and new ways to be better.  I   m excited about the future of Muskogee. A lot of money is beginning  to flow through. The educational system, according to the papers here  lately, received a lot of new moneys for alternative educational  approaches, for incentives for students, incentives for teachers. It seems  like it   s a new day. Ten years from now, we may be trying to get the  capital of Oklahoma from Oklahoma City. (Laughter) Changes from  time to time. Take it from Guthrie and get it to Oklahoma City. We can  become the hub of Oklahoma with the right leadership.  Anything is possible.  Anything is possible and anything is negotiable.  Well before we sign off, I would like for you to share again the story  about the baseball you would go watch.  Well, like I say, in our communities when I was younger, we had more  of a shared relationship, more of a sense of a community than we do  today. There wasn   t a whole lot of entertainment. Three channels on the  television, if that. So they would have these Saturday or Sunday baseball  games and the little park that was right down from the house was right  across the street from a baseball field where the Negro League would  play. When there was a game scheduled, parents and all the kids, we  would take our blankets down to the park and just lay the blankets on the  ground. My mother would always have lemonade or sandwiches and  stuff and we sat on those blankets and watched the game. I had some of  the greatest times of my life. It was a sharing time. A time where we  could yell for the team and everybody seemed to be friends. It was just  friends and family, a time where we didn   t have to lock our doors or be  fearful in our neighborhoods. It was much calmer, much more peaceful,  a much more beautiful time. Now we can   t go back, but we can bring  some of that stuff that used to be good in our communities today. I   d  love to see that.  Well with you behind the wheel, maybe we   ll get there.  Well with a lot of help, it   s my wish. But there   s got to be people   a  strong commitment from us all to say that we want to live better. We  want to enhance the quality of our lives. We can do it in our own  communities, but somebody   s got to start talking about it. Somebody   s  got to start saying,    Let   s do it.    I   d like to be a part of that process.  Sounds like you   d be very good at it.  20  Lee  Finchum  Thank you.  Thank you for your time and thank you for helping with all this, too. We  couldn   t have done it without you.  -------  -------
