 Finchum  Hale  Today is October 25, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library. I   m here in Stillwater, Oklahoma to  visit with Lou Hale regarding her creation of the Henry Bellmon bust  that was part of the dedication for the Henry Bellmon Research Building  on the OSU Campus. Thank you for having me today.  Welcome. I   m delighted to talk about the Bellmon piece.  Let   s start by learning a little bit about you. Can you tell us where you  were born and a little bit about your childhood?  Certainly. I   m a native Oklahoman. I have gone to school and lived in  various parts of the state, with a short sojourn in Texas during the high  school years. I   ve been sculpting since the early    60s, when I first  explored it in a casual setting among friends who were also artists and  found it to be fascinating. But it was a very busy time in my life, and I  was not able to pursue it. I did two or three pieces in water clay, which  then can be dried and fired and it becomes a permanent piece. It   s a  relatively inexpensive way to begin. However, I didn   t get back to it,  then, until the    80s, when my life had changed enough and settled  enough that I could add that to my things I enjoyed doing.  As I pursued it, I was living in Norman at that time, I became more  interested in portraiture than in figurative pieces or animal studies or  certainly, abstract things. I was always fascinated with portraiture, which  is a whole discussion in itself, in that there certainly are those who feel  that it   s a technical skill and not necessarily an artistic pursuit, but I  argue that it can be. It certainly can be. You only have to look at the  great portraits of the past to realize that they aren   t cherished because of  their high technical skill. They move people.  The Bellmon piece was not done in water clay, because I knew from the  5  beginning that it was going to be cast in bronze. That   s a very  complicated and expensive and time consuming process. The end  product of which I cannot do in my own studio. I do the modeling of the  piece. That is, moving clay around. (Laughs) Since Mr. Bellmon was no  longer on this earth, obviously, I sculpted the portrait posthumously  from as many reference photos as I could gather. Some from the OSU  archives, some from the state history center, some from the family. Ann  Hargis was very helpful in gathering some of the personal photos from  the family, the daughters, perhaps the grandsons.  So I had a great number to draw on, some of which are shown here  (gestures behind her) on a montage of Xeroxed photographs showing  Bellmon at different ages. The first thing I had to do after I got the  material was decide at which age to portray Henry Louis Bellmon. He  certainly was a young vigorous mayor   No  Governor  Governor of the  state of Oklahoma. (Laughs) Again, a second time, he was elected  governor later, two separate terms. I believe, the first Republican  governor in the state of Oklahoma. Many crossed party lines to elect him  because he was known for working with both factions very effectively in  a time that was quite unlike the present time, I think.  I decided that I would show Mr. Bellmon at the height of his powers, but  still a young man; and checked with those who had discussed the project  with me. And they felt like it was the artist   s prerogative as long as the  family was in agreement. We do remember Mr. Bellmon in his older  years when he was suffering from many of the concerns of poor health,  but that wasn   t what I wanted to show. So what I created is a  compilation of all those images and came up with   this (gestures to clay  bust) is the original clay for the portrait, which is now in bronze.  It   s reusable clay. It   s what we call plastilina or oil clay. It   s rather like  the clay you may have used when it was raining or too cold and your  teacher said,    We can   t go out on the playground today. Here is some  modeling clay.    The plasticity comes from the oil or paraffin or wax that  tiny bits of clay are suspended in. It will never be a final piece because if  you were to put this in the window sill where the sunlight would get on  it, it   d melt into a puddle. It also can be very stiff when the studio is  cold. And there are different hardnesses of this kind of clay. Every  sculptor finds one or two that they feel most comfortable with and  prefers to sculpt in that particular product.  Do I make it? No, I don   t. I don   t dig my own clay even when I   m  working in water-based clay, because I want 100 percent surety that a  piece will fire properly and something from the ditch likely would not.  Most commercial modeling clays are a mix of several ingredients. So  this does not get fired, but it does go to the foundry, the bronze casting  6  foundry. That is an art casting foundry as opposed to an industrial  casting foundry. There are more of those about than the ones that cast  memorials and statues. There are two, three in the state of Oklahoma, all  specializing in slightly different work. The piece of Mr. Bellmon was  cast at the Bronze Horse in Pawhuska, which is owned   that is, the  foundry is owned by the Free family, the John Free family. They have  provided these kinds of services successfully for decades. It   s interesting  to tour that facility.  This (gestures to clay bust) is now available to be melted down and  reused on my next project, most of the shoulders and the front of the  suit. The piece, a full shoulder bust is what we call it, has been melted  already, heated and in the process of being reused. But, so far, I have not  been comfortable with the idea of putting Mr. Bellmon   s head in the pot  to melt. (Laughter) I will, but I haven   t, let   s just leave it that way.  I gathered the photos, read a good deal about Mr. Bellmon to get a feel  for what he was like as a person. Had input from people that knew Mr.  Bellmon, some commentary. But in the final decision, I had to decide  myself what age? Where would the gaze be directed? Would it be a  perfectly formal bust, where the eyes of the piece are gazing directly at  the viewer, or would his head be slightly turned? Would he be reflective,  with his head down a little? Or would he be contemplating his record  with the head up?  I wasn   t comfortable with those. He had very heavy brows, a very heavy  brow bone, and that   s seen in a number of the photographs. When his  face is in repose, he almost looks angry. His brows are very expressive  so I had to be careful not to model a piece that made him look  forbidding. Not knowing what the final arrangement for the lighting  would be, knowing they were going to light it, but that can make a huge  difference whether it   s kind or otherwise. As it turns out, the lighting is  grand and enhances my work. (Laughs) I certainly didn   t want the  heavy, typical Bellmon brow to mar the fact that, apparently, Mr.  Bellmon was a peacemaker, firm, able to talk to farmers and kings,  heads of countries. My final resolution has just the beginning of a smile,  what I call the Mona Lisa smile. The gaze is directed slightly toward the  front doors of the building where the most viewers will enter. Not  markedly, but it seemed to work in the clay, and I   m very pleased with it  in the bronze.  What has led up to my doing a piece like this? My entire life, of course   I was interested in arts and crafts as a girl, and my parents were quite  supportive. I can remember having big jars of poster paints and big  brushes and pads of newsprint and getting out on the driveway on kind  of a homemade easel and just moving that poster paint around. (Laughs)  7  I remember the finger printing   not printing   finger painting era, when  I was introduced to that kind of jellylike colored goop that you could  swoosh around on wet paper, and I loved that. Later on, I did some  painting. It was always a good experience. There was a great eagerness  for young women to learn in my era, to embroider. (Laughs) And we  stencil painted things with fabric paint and special brushes, and you cut a  stencil out, and you could do tablecloths and pillowcases and napkins. I  did a lot of that, and my sweet mother and dad bragged on me, and I did  more. We used a lot of those brightly colored   I think they ran to palm  trees, as I recall. (Laughs) At any rate, I love the arts and was interested  in the history of artists.  Of course, I grew up, married, had three children. We did a lot of arts  and crafts together, and I taught elementary school in Lawton and then  again in Norman, fifth grade. People say,    What grade did you teach?     and I say,    This many,    (gestures) fifth grade. (Laughs) I did teach most  of the art where we did team-teaching, as opposed to the science or the  math. I can remember burning out three different Waring Blenders,  grinding up construction paper and water and wallpaper paste to make  colored papier-m  ch  . It taxed the blender to the point that I didn   t try it  the next year. But the kids loved it  (Laughs) We had a lot of art  experiences.  When I first experienced an opportunity to model in clay, I found it  engrossing and I was successful. That is, I got a recognizable likeness of  the Sitter, which I thought was kind of black magic, but I was at a point  in my life when I couldn   t really pursue it. Modeling clay, sculpting, is  messy  You really can   t do it at the kitchen table very easily or even in  the spare bedroom. You really need space and decent light and a hard  surfaced floor on the ground floor. So after I moved to Stillwater in the  mid-   80s, having taken a number of sculpture classes, while I lived in  Norman, at their remarkable community art center, called the Firehouse  Art Center. They had a strong program in sculpture at that time.  I came to Stillwater, no longer teaching public school and ready to  pursue sculpture. After a few years of trying to do that in a spare  bedroom, I found the space that I am in today, which I just looked it up,  and I   ve been here on the Berry Company property for fifteen years,  renting this wonderful room with plenty of light, on the ground floor,  with a hard surface and access to water. It   s like I work in an art colony.  There are other artists in the building. The company, I think, is happy to  have creative types in the building. There are only two who are  sculptors, some are painters, some are metal-smiths, jewelers. We once  had two musicians in the building. Luckily, they only worked in the  middle of the night and on weekends because they had thousands of  dollars worth of recording equipment and synthetic drums and electronic  8  keyboards. (Laughs) They were so polite and so nice, but I don   t know  what they did, but it was very loud. But they were thoughtful. It   s been a  wonderful place, peaceful. People don   t intrude. I don   t cook or clean  when I   m out here. Whereas at home, I wear that other hat that many  women wear.  I have taught sculpture at Multi-Arts, which is the Stillwater community  art center, often in the summer to young sculptors who haven   t had any  opportunity other maybe than Play-Doh or maybe soap carving. Of  course, removing material, as one does in stone carving or soap carving,  is one process. The kind I do is additive. You start with nothing and you  keep adding material to it to form in the way you want it. In Greek, I   m  told, the carving method is glyptic and the kind I do, where you start  with a bare armature and get mud out of the bucket and add it is haptic. I  hope that I   ve got it straight. I find it interesting to know that even then,  of course, they were discriminating between the two ways of achieving a  three-dimensional form.  I prefer the water clay because it   s fast and very responsive to the hands.  It wrecks your fingernails. You just don   t have any, because it   s  abrasive, slightly abrasive. But it lends itself to the clay finding where it  needs to be, if I can put it that way. Whereas, these oil   and some  people argue the other way, they much prefer this   this (gestures to clay  bust) doesn   t have to be covered. It   s not going to dry out. It can be used  over and over and over again. As I said earlier, there are different grades  of clay so that some get very soft like putty in your hands. Others have  to be warmed in a box with the right thermostat controlled heating  element so that you can get some of it and slather it on your piece.  That   s a process that doesn   t appeal to me as much. However, foundries  don   t much like to make molds, which is part of their responsibility, on  fired clay or wet clay. Leather-hard clay, it   s a different technical  problem for them, and so I try to meet their requirements when I know a  piece is going to be bronze.  People ask,    Why is bronze so much more expensive than terracotta?     Well, because true artisans have to take it from where I leave it. In other  words, I take a finished piece, very carefully, to the foundry of my  choice, and I leave it with them, and they make a series of negative, then  positive, then negative, then positive, then negative again, when they  melt the wax out and positive when they pour the hot liquid bronze into  the ceramic shell mold they   ve made. Every one of the people that work  in the foundry is an artisan and many are sculptors as well. But they   re  making a living by becoming expert in these various steps, and there are  many. I can   t do that myself. I don   t really know any sculptors who take  it beyond producing a wax, and some prefer to do that on their own  small pieces. Most of us do the modeling and take it to the foundry, or  9  Finchum  Hale  the foundry sometimes has to come get it if it   s too big to transport  safely. Large pieces, like a rider astride a horse, have to be cut into  pieces and molds made on separate hunks of it, and then each piece is  cast and it   s welded back together. And the seams are disguised with a  process called chasing. In other words, it comes apart in order to be  poured, and then it has to all go back together and be patined as one  piece. So it   s almost alchemy, really. (Laughs) I think of leaving a  bronze as my immortality.  Can you take us through the very first time someone approached you to  do Mr. Bellmon?  Certainly. It was about a sixteen month process. I was recommended by  a figure at OSU who is in charge of architecture. Nigel Jones  recommended  my work to Patrick Bumpas, AIA architect with Reese  Design Associates . The company that built the   I   m sorry, I   m getting  that tangled up. Reese Design Associates was in charge of designing the  Bellmon Research Center. A young man named Patrick Bumpas called  me and said,    I understand you   re a sculptor, and I   d like to talk to you  about doing a piece for a building that my company is building. Could  we meet?    I certainly welcomed him to do that, and so he hired me  based on what he could see here of the work I   d already done and some  of the portfolio pieces. We came to terms on how long it might take and  how much I might have to charge.  Sixteen months later   and he came several times to see the piece under  way   we had the end result. I worked on other things, and I have a life.  I have grandchildren and a wonderful husband, and we do things  together as a family. But most days, I   d give part of my time to being out  here. It   s the only way to get the work done. It was a pleasure to see, as  the building took shape, where the piece was going to be. It   s in a very  dramatic foyer with a beautiful extra-tall wall made of slate tiles, which  has a wonderful color and texture to it, and it makes a beautiful foil for  the bronze. When people come in the building, they can   t help but see  the namesake there in the hall. It   s right across from the elevator so  people coming out of the elevator doors will see the piece. It was kind of  a win-win.  Was I nervous that I might not catch the likeness I wanted? You just  can   t let yourself be. You have to be able to know that you can. It may  take longer than it should, most of my pieces do, but no. I really wasn   t  nervous. I wanted the family to like it. They did not come see it in  process. However, there was a committee from OSU with a great deal  invested emotionally in its turning out well. They didn   t really know me,  but they came one cold winter day, about nine people, including Dr.  McKeever, and we looked at my clay, which looked this color, not  10  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  bronze at all. They approved it and said they thought the family would  like it. Took pictures, sent the pictures to the family and I presume to  others and the word came back,    Yes.     At that point, I could have changed the expression, and I could have  made him older or younger, because you put it on, you can take it off. It  was a go, and so I did the final tweaking. Someone once told me that if  you think of a sculpture project as 100 percent of effort, the very last  part, the 10 percent of the unfinished work takes 90 percent of the time.  (Laughs) That long first part goes quickly and goes well, takes 10  percent of the time. That   s not really accurate, but we artists do find it  difficult to know when they   re done. Some famous artist said you need  to be two sculptors, one to do the work and the other one to say,    Quit.  It   s good enough. It   s done.    (Laughs) Sometimes my husband can offer  that perspective for me.  Did you know from the very beginning that it would just be a bust?  Yes, yes. I don   t think there was ever any question for a full figure. I  suggested that it be slightly larger than life-size because the space is so  large. I don   t really know what measurements, but my impression  certainly is that Mr. Bellmon was a tall, heavily built man. If you see  some of his early photos, here he is as a marine (gestures). He was  muscular and very well built. I had to assume that there is a chart that  tells you the average of this dimension for a man of so many years and  this dimension and so forth. So it fits in there, but it   s on the plus side. I  think I   m comfortable with the size, and he would have looked less than  he was, if I had made him two/thirds or three/fourths life size, which I  often do for people who are going to use a piece in a home setting. It   s  somewhat startling in a home to have a life-size bust and come into the  room and think its dear old dad over there and of course, dear old dad  has been gone for years. But if it   s smaller than life size, your brain  registers that it   s a representation of dear old dad. So that   s my theory.  (Laughs)  How much time did you spend on researching him?  Several months, as I recall. We went to Oklahoma City to the History  Center, the state historical museum near the capitol, and they were very,  very helpful. What I was after were Xeroxes of photos. We went to the  archives at OSU and again, the archivists were very helpful. They  brought boxes out to a table and I got to sit there and go through them,  some of which I already had, but many I didn   t. Again, I did some  reading, not so much about his career. I couldn   t, for example, talk at  length about the legislation that he was known for. I was an adult, but a  young adult, when he was serving and busy with children and a job, and  11  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  so forth.  You at least knew who Henry Bellmon was.  I did. (Laughter) I think everybody in the state who   s been around for  twenty-five or thirty years knows who Henry Bellmon was.  As you were going through the photos, did you come across one that you  thought,    This is it?     Yes. There are several taken at the same time, and the originals are very  clear. My Xeroxes aren   t always, but they   re from   let   s see if I can pull  it out   this era, which is during his first governorship.  In the    60s?  Yes. I think probably at that point he thought everything was still  possible. He was, I think, a sweet boy, probably, with a great grin from  the very beginning. So yes. (Laughs)  And you decided you wanted him to be half-smiling?  Just the beginnings of a smile. Everything changes in the face when  you   re smiling. The cheeks rise and sometimes the brows lower. You  can go to your own mirror and see what happens. But if you get one part  of the facial structure right, but you don   t understand what happens  around the eyes and to the brows and the skin and the neck    I mean,  and sometimes these things are very characteristic of an individual. They  will lower their head when they get a huge giggle spell. (Laughs) So you  have to know your subject, too. But I didn   t want anything too  exaggerated.  For example, I don   t sculpt teeth. If you   ve got a camera and you want a  grin with teeth, shoot a picture. (Laughs) There have been some great  pieces done in the past, but not very many. They were prior to  photography, I think. It   s technically more difficult and it   s tiresome. It   s  like why our ancestors at the beginning of photography always were so  grim, and they were sitting so still because the exposure had to be so  long, and they couldn   t hold a smile or a grin like we do with,    Cheese      So they look unusually somber. And of course, they had hard lives and  they probably felt dour, in the way they looked. Today, we look for a  great deal of expression in faces, and exaggerated expression is not  something that I want to pursue.  As part of your research, did you ask people about his character or were  you just taking it mostly from photos?  12  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Mostly from my reading and my personal research assistant, my husband  Doug Hale, was happy to do some of that and come back with tidbits.  Little things he   d found that might influence me, mostly to feel  comfortable about decisions I   d already made. (Laughs)  You almost feel like his eyes are following you. Was that something you  intended to do?  At a point in a successful portrait, the piece, literally, not only is looking  at you, but I feel like it   s speaking. The lips don   t move, of course, but  there is a communion between the hands and the brain and the inert  material. Sometimes you get it, and then you overwork it and you lose it  again. So your job is to,    Where   what did I do? How can I find that  again?    I feel, personally, that a piece that   s labored over too long, on  again, off again, loses its vitality. I have done pieces that simply could  not be resuscitated. Not because the material itself was no longer plastic  enough, because you can bring things back from being too dry. The  water clay you have to keep covered and damp. If you   re not working on  it, you have to take the plastic covering off and spritz it and sometimes  wrap it in wet old bath towels or damp old bath towels so that the clay  can continue to take some water in. That   s not true with this. This has  the advantage of being relatively inert unless it gets cold or it gets hot.  How long did it take you to get from your clay to this, not counting the  foundry part, but before you delivered it to the foundry   ?  About a year, and that   s too long. That   s too long. But again, I had other  projects that I had agreed to finish. Nothing quite as elaborate as this, but  commitments. I certainly had to make this ready when the building was  dedicated. I had a deadline, but it was moved forward some due to things  I didn   t have anything to do with in the building itself. That was good  from my standpoint, because the foundry wants three months or longer if  they are behind schedule. A large piece, they might want six months or  eight months, if it was going to have to be two figures or a family with  the dog. (Laughs) It gets complicated, takes more time. But my stuff is  all pretty basic.  Were you pleased with the work they did?  Very. Very. The patina, the color on the very outside of the bronze, is  achieved with chemicals, which are sprayed on or brushed on or both, to  simulate what happens to bronze in nature. Bronze has copper in it, a  good deal of copper, and we all know what happens to a copper roof or a  penny when it   s left out. Well, bronze will do the same thing. It will get  that blue-green patina. It doesn   t like to hold water. Over time, if you  13  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  had a figure with hands cupped and there was no drain hole, eventually  this area would be damaged. It   s a forever material, but it has certain  requirements. Outdoor pieces need to be sealed with a clear protective  coating and then paste waxed. They need to be waxed every several  years.  You may have seen an old outdoor piece that was very dull. Well, all  they need to do is get a can of Johnson   s Paste Wax and some rags and a  ladder and go out and re-wax. You feed it and it fills the pores of the  bronze and makes it lustrous again. There are many choices that  sculptors can make for commercial purposes, really. But the committee  that I was dealing with suggested, after looking through several books  with examples, we kept coming back to a warm bronze. A warm bronze,  not a black bronze, not a red bronze, not a brassy bronze, because there  is brass in the metal, too. When it comes out of the pour, it   s raw, and  it   s brassy looking. No shine to it, but that   s why it has to be chemically  treated to look like you promised it would. There   s an art in patinating,  too. There are specialists who are very creative and artists in their own  right.  From what I know about him, he would have been interested in the  whole process.  I think so.  He was full of curiosity by nature.  Yes. And it   s an ancient process. The Greeks were doing it a long, long  time ago. And the Chinese. (Laughs)  When it came time to unveil     Ooh   Can you talk a little bit about that?  It was covered, shrouded, and the lights were on it. The covering was  black, and I hadn   t seen it covered until I went in the day of the  dedication. Didn   t exactly know how that was going to play out, just that  probably I would be included in the group that pulled the drape off. I  believe both daughters and maybe his brother, his younger brother, were  there that day. I believe we all had hands on a different part. And the  piece is bolted in place. It is not going anywhere. The pedestal, which is  custom designed and made for the spot, the area and the piece, is bolted  to the floor. The bronze is bolted to the base so it can   t be knocked over.  It could be damaged if someone was willful. The most I can imagine that  14  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  will happen to it over time is if people touch the bronze in the same  place. If they   re led to touch an ear or rub the nose or pat the brow or  something, then eventually that patina will be affected and it   ll get more  and more brassy. Not at all what the sculptor intended.  There   s a famous piece of Will Rogers standing, a figurative piece, in  the Rotunda of the Capitol in Washington, done by Jo Davidson. When  you see it, it   s the classic,    Ah, shucks,    with his hair over. His foot is  sticking out in just an inviting place, and people do touch that shoe,  because it   s right there at about the right height. You   re not going to hurt  the face, and it has removed the patina, there, and it   s kind of a mark of  respect. Now, if it was the face, if it was a bust, it would not be. It would  be like touching a real human and not being invited to do that, I think.  That certainly has been characteristic of that Jo Davidson piece.  Well, did you hear comments from the daughters or George?  I   m sure I did. As you can imagine, it was a day of euphoria for me and  people were complimentary. I can   t give you a quote of a specific thing.  The brother, I believe his name was George, sweet, quiet, soft-spoken,  tall man. And he and my husband visited at length, and Doug relayed to  me that George was particularly pleased with the result, that it got him.  That is, caught his brother. That   s enough for me to know.  Sure. So it wasn   t a competitive process.  Not that I know of. I may never know how the muse and the gods  aligned so that I was asked to do it. But it moved me to be asked.  How long did it take you to decide that you wanted him to be younger  and slightly smiling? What was that process?  As we gathered the reference material and began these piles and files. I  did think about it a good deal. It just was the best solution, and I was  comfortable with it. The pictures in his old, old age, when Parkinson   s  had taken its toll   no one wants to be shown. That was never a  consideration on my part or suggested, but how about in the vigor of  your most productive years?  Is it harder to do someone that you   re doing a monument of than just     A person?  Yes.  Yes and no. No and yes. If there is sufficient reference material, that is,  15  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  many pictures   and when I   m doing a commissioned piece   and  frankly, a good deal of what I do are children for grandparents who want  to capture that precious young flesh before it becomes a teenager.  (Laughs) They bring the child to my studio, and I shoot my own  reference photos, many, especially now that it   s digital, because you can  just have them all over the place. The idea being if you see every single  degree of the profile all the way around, you will have the full picture at  least. Now, they may do this, and they may do that, and you want to  know what is their characteristic pose.  Kids are just wiggly and you   re just lucky to pick one. (Laughs) Most of  them are shy, and so you tend to say,    Would you lift your chin a little? I  need another picture.    So they overreact. But out of 100 exposures,  you   re going to find enough to    And then I actually use calipers and  measure a few vital reference measurements if it   s going to be life-size.  Generally, that   s what I do except in fired clay, which is much, much  less expensive than bronze   much, maybe a fifth the cost of bronze. It  shrinks when it dries and is fired, as much as 12 percent. So you don   t  end up with a life size head. It   s slightly less, which is, again, a  comfortable size for a household, generally.  Could you have had more than one made from the same   ?  I wasn   t asked to. The mold is extant, and it can be used for a number of  years. The materials they use eventually deteriorate, especially if it   s  stored in the heat. But it   s big, too, the mold. I haven   t retrieved it from  the foundry. So, sure, another copy, another edition could be made. I   ve  had no requests to do that. And it wouldn   t be the original cost because  the mold is already made, but it would be a good chunk of it. (Laughs)  Will it be your responsibility to retrieve it and keep it for that purpose or  do they automatically do it?  Yes. Yes. Although, that   s not in the contract. It   s just a matter of good  sense, I think. But if you do a lot of it, you would then kind of need to  rent space to store your molds, and I   m fortunately able to do what I  want to do   very fortunate, actually. I am certainly way past retirement  age, but this intrigues me. It   s new each time, because there   s no two  subjects alike. It keeps me focused on becoming better, and so far, that   s  achievable. The more you do, the better you get. I think of it as like a  musical trait that you would need to practice and continue to study and  maybe take up a new repertoire, somebody who hadn   t played before.  And I suppose eventually, you   d get to where you couldn   t move your  fingers and your brain fast enough to play as well as you once did. That  will happen with the sculpture, but there is a lot of tactile satisfaction.  16  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  I once had a girl who was blind, who really, really wanted to do a self-portrait.  I had no way of knowing how to approach that, but, by golly,  we did it together. We got a lot of clay all over our faces, but she seemed  to be very pleased with the experience. (Laughs) The product was not as  important as the process. The product was humanoid, and she could then  go touch it and know that she had made that by touching her own face  and then touching the piece. She had developed those skills beyond what  you and I would have, because that   s how she learned about her world.  She was about seventeen, I think, at the time.  I would imagine that you   d be a people watcher     Oh, yes.     if you   re out in a crowd.  At the airport, nothing better than getting to sit there and watch the  expressions go by. And the generations at, oh, like a fair or something,  where the grandparents and the parents and the children are all in a line  going in together and how the genes have trickled down. You see them  replicated in the other generations. Not with every family, but that   s  interesting to me. Frankly, if you   re in a place where you don   t offend  anybody, just sitting there quietly with a sketchbook, a pencil, and a pad,  you can do a lot of wool gathering on a park bench. (Laughs) I probably  don   t draw nearly enough.  Where do you typically get your inspiration?  For pieces?  Yes.  Now, most of the things I do are for specific purposes. I don   t do as  much   what do we call it? Speculative work. Therefore, I don   t have  very much to show in like an arts festival, pieces that would be for sale  because most people, although they   re interested in the technique        Why does she do that? How does she do that? How long does it take?     They don   t want a portrait of somebody else   s grandchild or somebody  else   s sister. I don   t, for example, do cowboys.  Why? Well, because lots of people are doing that and much better than I  would. I just feel I must be true to my own values. And that doesn   t  include genre pieces or caricatures. I don   t know anything much about  the circus or clowns. I   d have to do a ton of research to do a clown. I   m  not interested. I   m interested in the next person that walks in the door.  I   m always looking for models and people who will let me practice. So,  17  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  if that appeals to you, Mrs. Finchum, you could come out and get on a     we call it the throne, where the person who is posing sits. It   s a chair,  but    (Laughter) It   s hard work because it   s tiring after about the first  twenty minutes. That   s why they pay models. (Laughs)  Well, through the years, have you entered any of them in competition?  Yes, yes I have. Thank you for asking. I   ve had some success with that. I  had a piece accepted into the National Sculpture Society Annual Exhibit,  which opens every year in New York City and then moves to  Brookgreen Gardens in North Carolina, on the coast, a big mecca for  nineteenth and twentieth century American sculptors. There   s hundreds  and hundreds of pieces there. That exhibit simply travels for a few  months down there. To be juried in was very encouraging. (Laughs) I   ve  shown once in the big annual Sculpture in the Park in Loveland,  Colorado. Same reaction. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I did  actually get into that and enjoyed it. Most of the things that are in that  show are bronze and very little terracotta. And that   s all I was doing at  that time, fired clay. I think I sold two pieces out of the seven that you  were allowed to show.  But it was a wonderful experience and a lot of state and regional things.  There   s a very active Oklahoma Sculpture Society that meets in  Oklahoma City, once a month, on certain Thursday nights. They have  programs of information and new materials. And it   s of interest even if  that   s not the way you sculpt, because there   s a lot of information passed  among those that go. I   ve belonged to that for a long time. They have  shows and some are juried and some are not. I   ve participated in some,  but not always. (Laughs) It takes time and it   s kind of a vanity thing.  Been there, done that, you know? I don   t have all that much time left.  I   m aware of that, that we   re on the downward slope. I want to make the  most of it, and that means actually being in my studio working on  pieces.  Creativity is still flowing.  Oh, yes  Oh, yes, wake up just ready to go. (Laughs)  Do you notice more creative people migrate toward each other?  Yes, I think so. There are so many different ways to express it. I  understand that the digital world has so many ways to be creative. But  not having grown up thinking that way, I   m not inclined   for example, a  colleague of mine uses a camera to take a video of a subject as the  person talks and whatnot. Then he can project the video in his studio on  a monitor and stop it and check,    Oh, do I have   ? Okay.    That   s  18  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  certainly one step beyond this, but is it too mechanical? For me, it   s  distasteful. Almost like ordering a portrait sculpture by mail or online  (laughs), which you can do that. They digitally scan and it   s    I would  think it would not be an interpretation. It would be like a death mask.  (Laughs) But I   m biased because I think the artist does bring the process  something worthwhile.  Were there any in your family, in your parents or grandparents?  No. They encouraged my pursuing water colors and chalk, and they  thought that was worthwhile. Bought supplies, let me make messes. I  always felt that it was not a waste of time and not at the expense of the  household. I remember a teacher in the seventh grade who was very  encouraging in seventh grade art and said,    This is something you need  to keep doing.    It doesn   t take but a little bit of encouragement at the  right moment from a mentor or an adult.  I remember I did keep doing it. For example, in high school I met with  the local art league that got together and painted still lifes together. And  they were all adults, but they didn   t mind my traipsing in with my stuff.  That was a good experience. I   m just fortunate. I   ve had some formal  training and a ton of books. I love to read about it. Even the lives of  sculptors are interesting to me. I could rattle off a lot of names, but I  don   t think that   s what we   re after today. (Laughs) But if you do like to  learn by reading, you can teach yourself. You need some feedback and  some success, but that would be true in any line, I would think.  Well, as we wrap up, are there any last comments you would like to  make about Mr. Bellmon?  Well, we had a photograph made, Doug and I, in the foyer with the  piece. It   s one of several that were taken that day. Somebody sent us the  information digitally, and it was good of all three of us. I said,    Well,  Doug, I think we   ve got our Christmas picture. We can say,    Happy  Holidays from Doug and Lou and Henry     (Laughter) He wouldn   t  mind, would he?    But probably I won   t do that.  Although  he   s almost  a member of the family now.  That was part of my question, too. Your life gets pretty intertwined with  your subject for a while?  Well, certainly, for a time, yes. I mean, how can I say it? I   m honored  that I   ve been involved with Henry. You can feed on that for a long  time.  It looks like he   s smiling at us right now, as we talk about him.  19  Hale  Finchum  Hale  Finchum  Good. Good.  Well, if there   s nothing else, we   ll sign off.  All right. It   s been a pleasure.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
