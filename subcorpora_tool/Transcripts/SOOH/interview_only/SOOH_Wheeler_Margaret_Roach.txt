 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Sunday, February 15,  2015, and I   m interviewing Margaret Roach Wheeler who is the featured  Honored Elder Artist at the Tulsa Indian Arts Festival this weekend.  Margaret, you were a teacher before launching your textile business in 1984  where you   ve made your mark with one-of-a-kind, loom-woven clothing.  Your work has appeared in museum fashion shows, in a theatrical  production, and you   ve continued to teach and give workshops at  Chickasaw Nation, as well as overseas. In 2010, you were admitted to the  Chickasaw Hall of Fame. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Wheeler Oh, thank you.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Wheeler I was born in Sisseton, South Dakota. My father was in the Bureau of Indian  Affairs in school administration, so we traveled. I was only there in Sisseton  for one year. Then we moved to Nespelem, Washington. He worked with  the Colville Agency there, and then to Browning, Montana, where he  worked with the Blackfeet tribe at Cut Bank Boarding School outside  Browning. We were there six years, one of the longest places that we ever  were was at Cut Bank. Then he moved back to Oklahoma at Concho with  the Cheyenne Arapaho Agency and was there several years. Then finally he  ended his career at Tahlequah at Sequoyah Indian School. I was raised in a  lot of different places around a lot of different tribes. It was a wonderful  upbringing because of that, the education of being around so many different  tribes.  Little Thunder Definitely. Great intertribal education. You mentioned what your father did  for a living. How about your mother?  Wheeler My mother was a housewife. My mother never had a job outside the home  in her life. That was in a period of time when women did that sort of thing.  5  It was really wonderful for me and what I turned out doing because my  grandmother also lived with us and didn   t have a job outside the home. Fiber  work such as crocheting and knitting and embroidery was done constantly in  the home. Mother was sewing. She was making clothes for us. I say that   s  probably why I came up with the affinity. Never weaving. We didn   t ever  weave, but they had a needle in my hand when I was three years old, and I  was learning to embroidery and trying to make me knit and crochet which I  was never good at.  That   s probably why I love the loom because it was a structured   . It kept  my lines even, where in knitting I   d have one side long, and the other   . My  stitches were never good, but because I had two women in the household at  all times, I think it was a real solid upbringing. Food was important in our  lives. My mother, I said, was a professional housewife. Really, she loved it.  She loved to prepare. Everything was beautiful in our home. Food was  presented beautifully. The house was appointed beautifully. She was a  beautiful woman and dressed beautifully, too. It was really   that was her  job.  Little Thunder That sense of beauty was   .  Wheeler It was. The sense of beauty, my mother just carried through our home and  gave it to us. She had an important job, I always felt like.  Little Thunder How about siblings?  Wheeler I have two. I have a brother and a sister. My sister is the oldest. My brother  is in between. I made a comment one time when I was speaking, and I was  where people knew my parents when I said this. I said that Dad left a child  wherever he went. I   m meaning when he was teaching at Colorado River  Indian School in Arizona is where my sister, who   s almost twenty years  older than I am, married and stayed. Then they moved to Concho,  eventually. That   s where my brother married and stayed. He   s eight years  older than I am. Then they came on to Tahlequah where I married, but I  didn   t stay. I left. They stayed. They both have passed on now, but  Lawanda, like I said, we never lived in the same household because she was  married before I was born. My brother married when I was  nine  years old,  I believe. Was like being an only child, really. Sibling-wise, it was. My  brother, I think, took care of me, and I think my sister took care of my  brother. Mother had that built-in babysitter before she had another child.  Little Thunder You   ve explained your nice close relationship with your maternal grandma.  How about with your grandparents on the other side of the family?  Wheeler Both of my grandfathers died when my parents were children. I only had  grandmothers. My grandmother Roach always lived in the Oklahoma City  6  area. We lived close when we were at Concho. She would visit us in  Montana sometimes, and we would see her. My father, who was born in  Wapanucka, they migrated to Chickasha. That is a story that I just heard  recently. I heard an interview with my father that I   d not heard before. After  her husband died, Robert Roach, who was a doctor in Wapanucka, she had  four girls and three boys, but she wanted a good education for her girls. She  moved to Chickasha to be close to OCW  Oklahoma College for Women  so  those girls would have a chance. I thought that was wonderful to have a  widow thinking about where can she live to take care of her children. That  was new information to me when I first heard that. They were in Chickasha.  That   s where my father went to high school. Then Grandmother stayed in  that area, around her girls mostly.  They settled in the Oklahoma City area, most of them. One went to  Montana. That   s the one that I got see. Opal, I got to see quite a bit. If you   ll  notice, my father   s name is Diamond and all my aunts and uncles on that  side are jewels. Opal moved to Montana. Ruby and Emerald lived in  Oklahoma City. Jewel had passed away by the time I was born. Garnet lived  in Oklahoma City, and Onyx was in California. (Laughter) Oklahoma City  area is where my father   s family was mostly when I was growing up. My  grandmother Roach also went to Bacone  College  and was an accomplished  organist and loved to play. When she would come visit us, we were all  around the piano, and she was playing the piano. All my family was very  musical. I was the only one that wasn   t. My other grandmother played  beautifully, and my mother and father did, too. Music and the piano was  very important. Grandma Joanna Roach was the one that really loved music  and played.  Little Thunder Great mix of artistic influences. What was your first experience of seeing  Native art?  Wheeler When we lived in Montana at Cut Bank, one story   Sammy Bullcalf was  the name of a boy in the first grade. I was fascinated because Sammy had an  innate ability: he could draw anything. I was watching him constantly, and I  was trying to emulate him, trying to draw like Sammy could draw. He was  an Indian, and he was doing art, so that was real important to me. The other  thing is very lucky that we grew up at a time that WPA had the artists going  out and painting on the Indian school campuses where they would come and  paint, and some of the public buildings and post offices always had them.  Here you would see an Oscar Howe painting, that flat-pattern design that I  loved, would be on our school campuses. That was really when I just fell in  love with that style of painting and knowing it was Indian art. It was  majestic because it was so big and it was on the walls. I think our  government did a great service because it was in all the post offices. All of  our public buildings had wonderful art. The ones I saw, because we were  7  always around Indians, Indian Territory, was Indian art. That was a big  influence on me at early age.  Little Thunder What is your first experience of making art?  Wheeler First grade. I was so enamored with that ability that I worked at it. I worked  at eye-hand coordination from the first grade on. By the time we got third  and fourth grade, I was pretty accomplished. Then when we moved away  from Montana and I didn   t have Sammy to compete with, I became the class  artist. I would get to do backdrops for plays. I would get to paint on the  windows. I got that self-esteem of being the one that was good, would be  called on. In high school, I would do the annuals, do the drawings in the  annuals. It became an identity for me, and it was really, really important to  me. Always was, from the first grade on. It was what I knew I wanted to do.  Little Thunder Did you do any three-dimensional work during that period, too, or were  you   .  Wheeler Yes, as all students in school, they give you everything to work on. Then  when I was working on my undergraduate degree, I really went into  sculpture, and that was most of my emphasis at that level. I loved clay, but I  loved metal more. I had gravitated, by the time I had graduated with my  undergraduate degree, to welding. I was doing metal pieces. In fact, I won  First Place  in sculptures  at Philbrook in their national show in a welded  sculpture piece. That   s a good story because it was 1975, I believe, and I had  just graduated, and I   d just finished this piece. It was a dancing warrior with  rattles in his hands. I took it to Philbrook, and you get in line when you   re  putting your work in for jury. Well, right in front of me was Charlie Pratt  with his beautiful stalk of corn coming out of a piece of granite or marble  and going up, and there was turquoise.  I thought,    What am I doing here? What am I doing here? I don   t need to be  here,    because I   d just gotten out of school. He won Best of Show. I won  First Place. I was,    Oh, my gosh     That was great. That was what I was  wanting to do was get an acetylene torch and do sculpture. That was my  love for a while, but I had to teach. I got a teaching degree. I was teaching in  a wonderful situation. I student-taught there, and when they hired me, it was  only part-time. I would go into the classrooms in the morning and watch the  three men teach. Then I would repeat what they had taught that afternoon.  Their schedule was so busy that I was getting the overflow of students, but  they wanted the same information going to the students. I did that for one  year.  Then these three men that were teaching (they were just great) said,    We  need to come up with something else. This isn   t fair to you,    but it was fair.  It was fair because it gave me the best education I ever had. They were  8  excellent teachers, and to be able to go in and watch their techniques and  what they were doing    It was in ceramics, it was in sculpture, and in  painting and drawing. I was doing what they were doing, who were  seasoned teachers. It was the best education I got. After a year of that, they  then wanted me to come up with something we didn   t have, so I went back  to school to take jewelry. I was going to introduce jewelry, but that   s where  I fell in love with the weaving and the textiles. In the master   s program is  where I started weaving. I taught a course called Fiber Metal. As I was  learning at school, I was also teaching at the high school. That was, like I  said, one of the best educations, trying to learn and teach at the same time.  Little Thunder Now, you were teaching, watching the three men, and then teaching in what  school system at that point?  Wheeler Joplin.  Little Thunder At Joplin.  Wheeler At that time Joplin, Missouri, had two high schools, and I was at Parkwood.  It was just   we rivaled most colleges. Those men were such experts in their  field. It was a great place to begin teaching and learning.  Little Thunder Did I read that you also attended IAIA  Institute of American Indian Arts   for a bit of high school or not?  Wheeler No.  Little Thunder Okay.  Wheeler No.  Little Thunder All your high school happened in   .  Wheeler Tahlequah. No, I didn   t know about IAIA.  Little Thunder Did you immediately go from high school to college? Is that right?  Wheeler No, no. I married. Glen, my husband, who was from Tahlequah, went to  Northeastern  State University  and was in college there. We married, and  we had children, so I was a stay-at-home mom. When we left Tahlequah and  he graduated, we went to the Navajo, and we were at Leupp Boarding  School on the Navajo Reservation where he was a teacher. I had a two-year-old  and a three-year-old. I started taking courses at NAU, Northern Arizona  University, in Flagstaff. There was a group from our school would drive to  Flagstaff twice a week and take courses. I started working on college  9  courses then. Then I got hepatitis and was very ill. After I was out of  quarantine, they flew me back home, and Glen asked for a transfer.  We transferred back, then, to Seneca Indian School at Wyandotte,  Oklahoma. I got well enough and everything that I started going to NEO,  Northeastern Oklahoma, and I got an associate   s degree from there. Several  years went by, and we moved to Seneca, Missouri. I started going to  Missouri Southern  State University , so I   ve been to local schools wherever  we lived. I picked up hours, and it took me ten years to get my  undergraduate degree. Then I taught and then went to get the master   s. I  think I was twenty-three when I started, and when I finished the master   s I  was thirty-five. (Laughs) Twelve years to get that education.  Little Thunder Really some great, like you said, bits and pieces from all these wonderful  places.  Wheeler Being around different instructors, too, and different college levels is  wonderful because you get a variety. You   re not at one place under one  instructor, learning his style only. It was a great education.  Little Thunder Did you also study under Margaret Schick?  Wheeler Marjorie Schick? Marjorie was my main inspiration, I said, for where I am  today. When I went over to take jewelry   she   s a noted jeweler, a  worldwide noted jeweler. Books are out on Marjorie. I went over to take the  jewelry because we thought that   s what we wanted to teach. It was okay, but  I just didn   t have an affinity to jewelry. She had inherited a textile program.  The professor before her taught textiles and jewelry. She knew nothing  about the textiles but knew design. Excellent teacher, great motivator. As a  student watching her   . She lived in a little town in the Midwest, Pittsburg,  Kansas, but she was known all over the world. She would get her work out  there. She made us get our work out there while we were with her. We were  entering shows while we were working with her. Plus, she   d be at the  Whitney Museum  of American Art  doing something while I was student of  hers. She was also the American jeweler who was asked to go when the  Winter Olympics were in Norway.  I didn   t even know they did this, but they have an artist come. They set them  up in a studio, and they produce work during a two-week period of time at  the Olympics. Marjorie did that while I was associated with her. She was a  great person to say,    You can live anywhere, but you can get your work out  there. You don   t have to live in New York or Los Angeles or Santa Fe.    I   m  sort of a small-town girl anyway. That didn   t appeal to me, and I  immediately   . She had us put portfolios together and the importance of a  portfolio and making introductions. Through her, as soon as I graduated, I  had a portfolio together. I went to every major Indian museum that I could  10  and presented my portfolio. That   s where my career started. I always feel  like I owe Marjorie that push that I don   t know if a lot of people get when  they go to college. It   s just so important to be around a dynamic person that  is doing it, and you see them doing it.  Little Thunder And your portfolio at that point would have contained some sculpture as  well as weaving?  Wheeler Mostly by that time, I was really focusing on the weaving. That   s what I was  presenting. I had stopped doing the sculpture. I never did buy the acetylene  torch. (Laughs) Never set up that studio. It was mostly textiles that I was  showing.  Little Thunder When and how did you acquire your first loom?  Wheeler When I was in school with Marjorie, all of my things were off-loom  weavings. My husband and I like to build houses, and our first house we  built was in 1970. It had beams in the ceiling. That was shag-carpet era. I  wanted a big loom, so I put great big hooks up in the ceiling, and hooks  down in the shag rug. Put poles through that and strung my work from floor  to ceiling. That was the loom I worked on most. I would string warps up,  turn a stool upside down. Anyplace I could find two rigid poles, I could  string a warp up. That was my main thing I was doing through school. One  of the pieces that I showed early on at Philbrook that was textiles because I  had left the sculpture, and this would have been like 1977,    78   .  Little Thunder For the Indian Annual?  Wheeler Yes, for the Indian Annual. I got a piece in that was woven. It was my first  loom, but I really bought it for my daughter. It was an S H Green Stamp,  little, two-harness child   s loom, and I did a piece on it that I got into  Philbrook. (Laughter)  Little Thunder So it   s not the loom that makes the weaving, is it?  Wheeler No, no, not necessarily because I   d woven different strips and then put them  together and padded them and beaded and did all these things to it. I went to  War Eagle for my serious first loom. It is a craft fair in Arkansas. I think it   s  near Rogers, Arkansas. It   s on Beaver Lake. I saw a beautiful loom there.  Thomas Bangert was the man who had made it, and he lived in Eureka  Springs. All of the wood he was using was walnut that they   d cleared out of  Beaver Lake before they flooded the lake. It was all native walnut. I always  talk about it because Native Americans believe the tools they use need to be  beautiful and that imbues the fabrics that I am making if I have a beautiful  loom. So Thomas built my first loom. It is with me. It   s down in Sulphur at  my studio now. It   s sort of a showcase loom, really, because it   s all pegged,  11  put together, more primitive looking than my later looms. It is a  countermarch which is a more difficult loom to string up and to weave on.  It   s just a wonderful loom, so that was the first loom that I acquired. That  would have been, like, 1979, 1980.  Little Thunder After a number of years of teaching, you mentioned that your husband was  able to support you and you decided to go full-time. Sometimes artists will  start showing without opening a business. Were you already thinking in  terms of,    I   m going to open a business to do this   ?  Wheeler I don   t know. Mahota was my great-great-great-grandmother that came with  Removal with the Chickasaws. She was Chickasaw. Along the line, I knew  that I wanted a business name, and that   s what I wanted. I wanted it to be  her name because I wanted all my work to reflect my heritage and be Native  American. I was simulating bead work and ribbon work and feather work in  the loom structure, the weaving itself. I must have wanted to have it as a  business, per se, but I never wanted, like, a storefront. I always knew I  would have to go away from where I lived to show my work to sell it. I  didn   t want my work hanging on hangers. I wanted it on the body. I wanted  the movement of it. That   s why I went to the museums.  I was looking for fashion shows.  I wanted my work on humans, not  hangers . I really resisted going into the Indian markets where I would have  a rack of clothing hanging. Gilcrease was one of the museums I took my  portfolio to, and I did a fashion show for them. That was wonderful. I got  into the Wheelwright  Museum of the American Indian  with their yearly  fashion shows that they did. The Heard Museum put me in a show that was  called Native Art To Wear. It was on a mannequin, and it was displayed for  six months. From me going out to those museums with that portfolio, I got a  show at each place I went. One of the first shows, one-woman shows I had,  was at Anadarko at the     Little Thunder Southern Plains  Indian  Museum?  Wheeler    Southern Plains Museum, yes. That was the first one-woman show I had,  and everything was up and on display. I wasn   t hanging racks, selling like  that. Then through that, and it was through the Wheelwright Museum,  Rowena Dickerson was there at the Wheelwright Museum. They were doing  the fashion show, so I met her through that when I was doing the fashion  shows with them. But they were also doing other fashion shows, and they  would provide the models and everything. I know we went to Penn State one  time and did a Women of Color fashion show, so Rowena and I became  very good friends. When she left the museum, she got on at the Inn of the  Anasazi in Santa Fe. I don   t know what her title was. It was more than a  concierge in that when people came in, she would plan tours of Indian  12  country for them and would put on events there in the hotel. I became one of  the Twelve Days of Christmas.  To go back even further than that, they were building the hotel. The Zimmer  group out of Dallas were the ones that were putting the hotel together and  going to manage it. They wanted it to be a holistic hotel and that they were  really teaching about Indians. For the first night before they opened, they  were having the architects and the bankers and everybody come in. They  had a speaker that was coming. That was going to be the opening before the  official public opening. The speaker they had hired got ill, like, a day or two  before, three days before. She called me two days before and said,    Can you  come do a fashion show?    I said,    Well, sure.    I arrived in Santa Fe; I think  it was a Thursday night. She had all the models ready. We placed that. The  next day she had hair and makeup. Ray Tracey was our jeweler. We did a  fashion show for them, and Zimmer loved it.  The other wonderful thing with that, it was artists that were my models,  some of them. Emmi Whitehorse. Just wonderful. Wives of artists. It went  over so well, and they wanted me then to be a part of the hotel. That   s why I  could go down. I could become one of the Twelve Days of Christmas with a  presentation and a lecture about clothing and Indian clothing and do a little  fashion show. I also would go out during market, and they would give me a  fashion show in the hotel dining room. Then I would have a trunk show in   their library and see clients in  my room. I was not down in the market, but  I was there for several years doing that because I was still resisting being in  the market. I still wanted clothes on the body, but I was also taking  commissions. Being in Santa Fe was the most lucrative place for me to be.  There were a lot of commissions, and weaving is slow. I became almost two  years behind. I knew I had to make a change and I had to figure it out some  way.  I quit taking commissions, finished every one that I had promised I   d have  something for. Eventually, people were leaving the hotel after, like, five  years, so it was time for me to move on from that. I finally gave up then  because I knew I needed to be in Santa Fe and start applying for the Indian  Market and got into that. That became what I was doing was the Indian  markets. I think I did around seven Indian markets: the Heard, the Eiteljorg   Museum of American Indians and Western Art , National Museum of the  American Indian, and of course the Chickasaw SEASAM  Southeastern Art  Show and Market , Tulsa, the Cherokee  Art Market , and Red Earth. I  realized finally,    Okay, you   ve got to hang them on a rack. This is the best  way to do it,    (Laughter) and I gave up on the fashion shows. Long, round-about  story for your question, that   s how it all happened.  Little Thunder Wow  I   m really impressed that you, on your own initiative, put together the  portfolio, went to visit the museums. I   m friends with Phyllis Fife, and there  13  were a couple of Native fashion lines out there but not a lot. For a museum  to just, having seen your portfolio, be ready to commit to a fashion show is  very interesting.  Wheeler Every one that I went to   the first was Gilcrease, then the Wheelwright in  Santa Fe, the Heard Museum in Phoenix. I for some reason didn   t go to  Philbrook. I don   t know why I didn   t go to   . Southern Plains. Those were  the ones that I targeted, that I would visit. I called and made appointments  and went in and showed my portfolio, and they all placed. It was really  wonderful. I was very fortunate, very fortunate. I knew through education  that I needed to look good in that portfolio. I would have samples of the  cloth and maybe be wearing one of my garments so they could see the  quality. It just was the right thing for me at the right time.  Little Thunder What was the biggest surprise in doing the museum fashion shows?  Wheeler No sales. I thought it was going to be a place where I could really, you  know   people come for the entertainment more than   . I sold very few  things through fashion shows. It   s more the entertainment. They   re so  exciting, and they   re so much fun, and I loved doing them. I loved seeing   .  Little Thunder They   re pieces of theater.  Wheeler Exactly, so I loved the whole idea of it, but, again, there were just no sales  from fashion shows for me. The ones in Santa Fe were gorgeous. Sometimes  they   d be in artists    studios, set up, and they   d get the models that were  wonderful. Also, I got photographs of, like, Jody Naranjo, famous artist  now, when she was a teenager in one of my outfits. I was meeting people  through the fashion shows, too, that were great because the models out there  mostly were artists that you were meeting.  Little Thunder You used a word that struck me because you used the word    action.    You  were interested in the action of your clothing. Sometimes you will hear     movement.     Wheeler Right.  Little Thunder I wonder if you could explain that for us.  Wheeler To see fabric moving in the air, to me, is so exciting. I do a series   I still do  some sculpture. I do a series of poles that I have fabric hanging off of. My  favorite are called the Wind People. They are outside. I have one at my  home. Polypropylene is the  yarn  I use, which is an indoor/outdoor carpet  yarn. Just the other day, I was standing watching his fringe, the wind was  blowing fringe, and the cloth moving. That is exciting to me. Even in my  sculpture, I used to try to   it looked like it was blowing. It   s been a  14  fascination with me to see the movement of fabric and the folds of fabric.  It   s just something I love.  Little Thunder What about competitive shows? What was your first major award?  Wheeler Competitive shows and first major award   .  Little Thunder That would   ve been Philbrook, I guess, but possibly one for fashion?  Wheeler Yeah, for the fashions. One of the educations for me personally was I loved  doing the big pieces with headdresses and things like that. I would enter  them, and I wasn   t getting any awards. These were some pieces that  museums were looking at, but in Indian market competition, they were not  getting any attention. Then about eight years ago, I became associated with  the Chickasaws. Because I grew up around Plains tribes mostly, I loved the  buckskin, I loved the beading, I loved Woodland style with theirs, but I had  just never really looked at Southeastern clothing. When I was down there, I  thought,    Okay, I am now associated with my tribe for the first time. I need  to look at our history and our clothing.    I started going back through  photographs and looking in the Chickasaw journal, their history journal.  I found two boys in coats that have the real turned-back lapels, large lapels  coming back, shawl collar, almost. They called them Chickasaw hunting  coats. I thought,    Oh, I could   .    So for the Heard Museum, (this is  probably maybe ten years ago, I   m not sure) I did a Chickasaw hunting coat  in red, and I did the turban-style hat. I had the black feathers on top like I   d  seen from drawings and illustrations. Had a sash, and I did a pouch to  match. I beat the Navajo rugs. I won Best of Class in the textiles. It came  home to me.    Okay, this was my tribe. This is coming through me. It   s a not  a big owl or wolf headdress. That   s good.    All at once, I realized the judges  were looking for something that represented you through your tribe. When I  realized that, I started winning awards. Isn   t that amazing, that it comes  from that?  Little Thunder It is.  Wheeler I always felt very good about that. That was probably one of the biggest  things, was actually winning over a Navajo rug. I never thought I could ever  do that.  Little Thunder Especially from the weaving perspective.  Wheeler Yes, yes, yeah, but it was a Chickasaw hunting coat that did it. (Laughter)  Yes.  Little Thunder What   s the best business advice you got starting out?  15  Wheeler Well, the portfolios, of course, for one, and to keep a record. Every show     we started out very early on the master   s program. Every show you   re in, get  the brochure, keep a postcard if it goes out, if there   s any photos, hold onto  those, keep them together, and then you can put your portfolio together. If  you don   t keep the materials, you   re not going to have a record of that.  That   s what you need: verification that you were in that show, that you won  that award. Always keep that so that you have it for your portfolio. In the  beginning, that was the best. The other thing, when I lecture and I talk to  people about starting their own business and all, is photographs because so  often we are juried by photographs. I learned that very well from Marjorie,  also. This was the early    80s. I was at Boulder at a conference. I went to a  lot of conferences on textiles and weaving to see what other people were  doing, just finding out what the fiber world was because it was new to me  when I started in    77, I think, when I finished my master   s,    78, maybe.  I was just grasping for anything to see what the world was about in fibers,  and going to a lot of conferences when I   d find them. I was sitting by a  woman. I knew photography was important, and I had taken two seminars  by two different established artists at Boulder. You could go in and speak to  them at this conference ahead of time. You set up that this is what you want  to do. They set a schedule up, and you got thirty minutes with this  famous   . It was Randall Darwall, at that time, who I had a conference with  then. Bring your portfolio in, and they go over the portfolio, and they talk to  you. I thought,    I would love that,    so I did that. He had seen my work in a  little fashion show the night before where we were wearing our own clothes.  It was real informal. He said to me,    I   ve seen your work. Your work is  good. These photos don   t show it.     I was having my photographs done by a professional photographer in Joplin,  Missouri, that I just thought the world of. It was a good friend. One of my  friends was the model, and I thought they were great photographs. That was  his comment. Then another time, I had the same thing was going on with  another artist. She said the same thing, and this was within a month or two,  different conference.    Your work is good, but your photographs don   t show  it.    I hadn   t been getting in any shows with those photographs. At one of the  conferences, I   m sitting next to a woman who was from Chicago, the  textile   what was the name? It was a store, a famous store, and she had  these beautiful postcards on her desk beside me. I said,    Where did you have  those done?    She said,    They were done in Chicago.     She told me the name of the photographer. Soon as I got home, I called that  photographer. His receptionist tried to discourage me. She said,    It   s very  expensive.    I said,    I know, but I want to do this.    I had taken everything   I  had only taught ten years in public school, and I had taken all that money  and put it in the bank. It was what was going to get me started, so I had a  16  little bit of cash set aside for that. They made me the appointment. I shipped  five outfits up there. They told me to bring what jewelry I could. I flew to  Chicago in the morning and met with the photographer. There were six  people working on that photoshoot, and I was there all day. When I left in  the evening, I had transparencies in one day. The first thing that I happened  was I made the front cover with one of his photographs of Shuttle Spindle  and Dyepot  Magazine , which is Handweavers Guild of America     Little Thunder Wow.  Wheeler    on the same piece that I   d had the Joplin model use. That   s still an iconic  photograph that everybody that sees me remembers that photograph that   s a  weaver.    Oh, that   .    The second thing that happened with those  photographs   I got lots of photos of each outfit but only five outfits. The  second thing that happened is with the show that was at the Heard Museum.  It was an exhibit. Chester Freeman called me, and he was a freelance writer  out of New York, and he had seen that. He was going to be writing for an  Australian journal. He wanted me to send him photos, and he interviewed  me over the phone. He liked the interview, and he liked the photos, so he  submitted to Ornament Magazine an article on me. Ornament   s a really nice  magazine. Ornament had another fiber artist that was going to go on. We  were put back, like, eight or nine months before they would do the article on  me that Chester had written, but when they saw my photographs, we went in  within two months.  They considered giving me the cover of it, but I got a full page inside.  That   s what good photography will do for you. If you   re going into business,  pay for it. It took three years of me teaching. It was a third of the nest egg I  had put back. It   s the best money I ever spent. If I have any advice for  anybody and you   re doing competitions or you want to be in magazines or  anything like that, your photography has to be professional, and you need to  pay for it. Now I know what I   m looking for. I watched him. I had a stylist;  there was a camera assistant; there was the photographer. I found out that he  was taking Polaroids at that time, and he would fold them up, and he would  show me.    Does this look like something you would want?    I   d say,    Yes.     He   d take a roll of film, hand it to somebody that disappeared I didn   t know.  They were taking it and having it developed. That was before all this instant  cameras like we   ve got today.  Little Thunder Right.  Wheeler Developing it, he was seeing it before he did his final shots of how he could  adjust light, how he could do this, what he could do this. It was a  professional model, a stylist. They brought out their own Indian jewelry.  The stylist was suggesting we do things that I would never have thought of.  If there was wrinkle, the stylist would take it off of her, go press it, put it  17  back on. I learned, and I tried to watch everything and learn,    This is what  we need.    Now I do have a great photographer that is local, but I   m still, I   m  not good. I don   t want to bother someone to take it off,    That   s got a  wrinkle.    I   ll try to think,    Well, it won   t show,    or something. (Laughter)  That was probably the greatest education, too, was actually being in a major  photoshoot.  Little Thunder Thank you for sharing that. It   s a great story. Can you talk about a highlight  or two from your experiences? I think you got a fellowship at the National  Museum of the American Indian.  Wheeler Yes, yes. Atlatl and the National Museum of the American Indian were  offering these fellowships. The first time I entered it, I entered my poles, my  Mahotans, I call them. They   re tall poles because that   s always fascinated  me and it was the sculpture aspect. They had fiber on them that I   d been  seeing. The Chippewas, I also heard, would put personal items and hang it  off of a tree, and that would ward away impending dangers and all. So I  loved that idea. That got turned down. Oh, no, I   m sorry. That   s the wrong  story. My first proposal, I   d been to China. It was real small. There were  only nine people on the tour, and we were all weavers, mostly. We were up  in the mountains in Southwest China and learned that it was much like the  Native Americans in that they had been taken to a certain area. We were  with the Miao tribe, and we would go into their villages and look at their  fiber works.  We were there also to watch the silk. There were silkworms that did felting.  We missed it, but we got to see the product. We were just a little early when  we went. I just could not get over when we   d go into these villages how  similar it was to Native Americans. Like in Montana, grass whistling with  the Blackfeet was something when I was growing up. I hadn   t heard it  probably in forty years. The Chinese, they came out, and they were  whistling with the grass, and the dances, the round dances and all. I came  back, and my first proposal was the similarities between ancient tribes and  people that had been moved. I got turned down for that one. That   s the other  thing: don   t quit. Always try again. The next time that I applied, I applied  for the poles, and I used the Chickasaw pole as the story of it and my  interest in it. Also     Little Thunder Maybe you should quickly just explain the story.  Wheeler Oh, the Chickasaws, there were two groups of people, two brothers. Their  people were behind them. They would take this pole, and at night they  would put the pole into the ground. In the morning, whichever way the pole  was leaning, was the way they would go to find their homelands. There was  an argument over the pole, which way it was really leaning. That   s when the  two tribes, they broke up, and one became the Choctaw, and one became the  18  Chickasaw. That   s an ancient story that we have. I had written that. I   d also  written about the Chippewas putting personal items on a pole, impending  danger. The Mandan poles have things, probably hides, off of them. The  whole thing of fabric coming off of a pole is really interesting to me. I got  accepted for that one. They called me and said there are no poles to research.  The last one they had had been at the Peabody  Museum , and it was  repatriated, so could I choose another subject.  Then I went with the fabric of the Mississippians, the textiles of the  Mississippians which was a much wiser choice for me, really. That   s what I  got the fellowship on. This was before the museum had been built in  Washington, DC, so I was really headquartered out of New York. You got to  structure your own program, and then they helped put it together. In that  time I was in New York, we went to the Brooklyn Museum. No textiles  there, but I got to see pipes and wonderful things that were from the  Mississippian period. Then I took a train up to Rochester, New York, the  New York State Museum. Or is it in Albany? Anyway, I took the train up  the river and went to the New York State Museum, and Penelope Drooker is  there. Penelope wrote the book on Mississippian textiles, and I had met her  through conferences way before she had written the book. In fact, she was  working on her master   s, the paper, the doctorate, and had sent me her  copies of that before she had written the book.  I went up to see her to visit with her, go over different things on  Mississippian textiles. The other place I went was the Peabody. I flew into  Boston from New York. I couldn   t get into the Peabody Proper because  there was a conference going on and that curator wouldn   t let me down  unless she was there. But Andover would, so I went on up to Andover and  went through there. They had really some remarkable effigy pottery and  things. It was a great experience there. Going to the museums and also in  New York, American History Museum, and looking at their artifacts, it was  just wonderful. Finally, we went down to Washington, DC, for the last part,  (I think it   s a two week program at that time) and got to go out to the   Capital  Research Center, the CRC. I would walk across to the National  History Museum to look at the Spiro artifacts there because our museum,  the big trucks were coming in and they were cleaning and cataloging and  everything.  There was really nothing for me to see at the National Museum of American  Indian, but I could use the Smithsonian, so I did that while I was down there.  That   s where I saw the best representatives of the textiles of the  Mississippians, and they were all from Spiro Mounds. Wonderful,  wonderful experience of getting to get into the basements of these museums  and look in drawers and behind cabinets. I was fortunate enough   after the  museum had been built, they asked all of their fellowship people back to go  through the new museum, so I got to go back for another visit and be in  19  Washington, DC. I had three days then to go through the exhibits and the  textiles. I recommend it to everybody, to apply and keep applying until you  get it because the research is just invaluable.  Little Thunder You   ve also taught, you   ve taught a workshop, I read, in the United  Kingdom?  Wheeler Yes, one of the great things about fibers that I learned when I first started in  the late    70s is we have a networking that   s wonderful. You have a lot of  local guilds. In the past, right now I   m a member. My active guild is the  Tulsa  Hand weavers Guild. It   s an excellent guild. There   s the four-state  guild in Rogers, Arkansas. I   ve attended them. Springfield, Missouri, has a  guild. I   ve also been a member of the Saint Louis Weavers Guild. There   s  weaving guilds all over in little towns. Crowder College had a weaving  guild in Neosho, Missouri, which is just twenty miles from Joplin. You start  out with these little groups. Then I found Missouri Fiber Artists which is not  just weaving. It   s all fiber art. I started attending those in the early    80s,  conferences with them, once a year. The people I met at that time, we have  grown such good friends, and we   ve done so many shows together.  We   re doing another show now in Ardmore, Oklahoma. I   m bringing  Missouri artists. (Laughter) We   re having a textile show at the Goddard  Center next September. I think it opens September 8. I curated those shows.  From that connection early on, we were all teachers, but we all pursued our  crafts. The five women I have are nationally known artists now in their  fields, all textiles but not clothing like I was doing. From that, there   s the  Midwest Weavers Guild that has a conference every other year, and I  became active in that. They were at Lawrence, Kansas, one of the first times  I showed my work in a fashion show. Then from there, from the Midwest,  all the differences, the Intermountain Weavers. There   s a California   .  There   s these weaving organizations all over.  Then every other year from that is Convergence, the international weaving  conference where people come from all over the world. It   s put on by the  Handweavers Guild of America. I slowly worked myself up from little local  guilds to state organizations, to a Midwestern organization, then into a  national. I think without that networking, my career wouldn   t have taken off  in the weaving world as much. It   s very different from what I   ve done in the  Indian world. My clothing has stayed the same, and I   ve been sort of the  token Indian in those shows. It was a whole different group of friends in the  weaving world, teaching and doing the conferences. There   s one woman in  Scotland named Belinda Rose, and she started coming to my lectures that I  would be doing at Convergence. Others from England were taking my  workshops, and they would go back and talk about me, so I   ve been asked  back.  20  I think I   ve taught five or six workshops now in England and Scotland. I  even spoke at the Battleby Fair, which was wonderful, outside Edinburgh,  which was wonderful because they   re fascinated by Native American. It   s  just been a wonderful, wonderful   . In some ways I   m so glad I got out of  painting and sculpture and took this on because it   s a path that a lot of other  artists hadn   t taken and it   s been a unique   . At one time, (I don   t know if  it   s true today) I was the only Native American having a handwoven line of  clothing. I had my own little niche. It   s been wonderful. It   s really been  wonderful. It   s all chance. It   s all luck. It   s just being at the right place at the  right time but also using what you   re learning and going forward. The  networking is wonderful through the weaving world, textiles.  Little Thunder Yeah, it sounds like such a rich world. You also teach for the Chickasaw  Summer Academy and at the ARTtesian Gallery in Sulphur. What   s valuable  about that for you?  Wheeler Well, they   re two very separate things. Chickasaws have the Chickasaw Arts  Academy. I love teaching. I love teenagers. I   ve been out of teaching  since   1984 is when I quit teaching high school, so when I had a chance  and I was asked to teach at the Academy, I just snapped it up. I teach  textiles. You   re only allowed eight students, so you get very intensive time  with the students. You   re with them from eight in the morning until five in  the evening. You have lunch with them. It   s intensive. In that two-week  period, we produce an ensemble for a fashion show. They have to have a  garment and accessories to go with it that are all textiles. We   ve done some  weaving; we   ve done discharge; we   ve done dyeing. I have a garment  maker, which is a computer program where we can create the patterns. I   m  always searching. But these students, when you get that much time and  individual time with the students, you can really see the development.  Jay Fife just came by to see me yesterday. He won the scholarship that I had  proposed, that one to two of my students each year be given a scholarship to  Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. We   ve done it for four  years now. That   s the other thing is to see the growth of these students when  they can go into New York, go into classes with students from all over the  world, because there are students there from everywhere in these high  school classes. So far, every student I   ve taken has excelled. They realize  that they can compete. They   re viable on that level. It gives confidence you  couldn   t believe. Ryan Jordan, who was with me from the time she was  thirteen to last year when she was eighteen, is now at North Texas State  University in their fashion program. It   s just so rewarding to be able to be  part of a program that can offer that and to see these students. Like Jay, this  was my second year this past summer to have Jay in class, and in that one  year to see his growth   .  21  That   s the other thing. When they are thirteen to fourteen, or fourteen to  fifteen, you see the maturing as adults, also, and that   s just so rich. Jay   s  work this year, I thought, was outstanding. His whole piece had to do with  an Indian living in a white world. It has to be a garment, and I want them to  do something that   s cultural. He took a tuxedo and cut it in half and then put  a white shirt on this side. Then he took a Creek design, it was on display out  here the other day. He cut little triangles out. If you   ll look up close, he   s  machine stitched around, perfectly around, creating this design on this white  shirt that   s all Creek that   s going into the back of the shirt, and then this  black tuxedo. Then he   s done an arm band with designs that are all stitched  on, and also a little thing that went in the pocket. To be able to see someone  that knows that there   s going to be struggle living in this white world and  keeping your Indian identity, I thought it was one of the strongest pieces,  plus his behavior in the classroom and all.  He   s going to New York in June. I take them to the Costume Institute at the  Metropolitan; there   s always a wonderful show there. We got to a Broadway  show that costumes are the main thing. Try to go down to the National  Museum of the American Indian in Lower Manhattan and just expose them  to art in a big city. It   s been really a great program. That was all through the  Chickasaws and Chickasaw Arts Academy. Then the ARTesian, when they  built the Artesian Hotel, they bought an old building across the street and  redid it. It   s the ARTesian Gallery and Studios. They have studio space for  artists in there to work. I hopped on that really quick. (Laughter) In fact, I  think I moved my loom in before I was told I could. They were having an  intertribal council meeting at the hotel for the first time. We hadn   t even  opened the galleries yet, but my room was really completed and all. I went  in and put a rug and put a loom up when nobody was around so that they  could see that there was going to be artwork going on in that studio. I was  never called out on it.  I thought I possibly could be because I didn   t have a hard hat on when I was  doing that. Now I   ve had the studio open for a year. We opened last January.  In September, I started accepting students and teaching. I can take six  students. My dream is to create a co-op, a Chickasaw  weaving  co-op, and  it   ll be Mahota Studios at the ARTesian. We   re doing housewares. I   ve  moved away from fashion. I won   t be doing clothing. I   ll always have some  pieces, and I   ll work them because that   s my love, but the main thing is  rugs, table runners, placemats, things for the home, your hand towels. We   ve  been talking lately, and this is what I am so thrilled about. I have five  students, and nobody wants to leave. They want to stay, and they   re coming  to me with ideas of what we could have there. That   s what I want. I want  this to be a co-op where I   ll teach the weaving, but I also want ideas coming  in. We   ll have ruanas and shawls and ponchos. Unstructured clothing, we  decided would be good to have.  22  At this point since September, which that means, what, five or six months, I  am very encouraged that this possibly will make it. One of my students the  other day brought a magazine that   s called Selvedge. It   s a gorgeous textile  magazine that comes from Europe. Phyllis said,    We need to be doing this.     She said,    We need to become a community,    and I thought,    Yes, this is  what I want. I want us to be very high in Native American things.    The  Smithsonian has talked to me, but you   ve got to be a production company to  be able to do that. I would love in ten years to be able to do that, that  museum gift shops will be carrying the Mahota Studios at the ARTesian  housewares. That would be a wonderful thing. That would be a wonderful  thing. That is our goal at the moment. That   s what I   ve abandoned  everything else to put   that   s the main thing in my life now, and it   s being  very rewarding, very rewarding.  We now have twelve weavers.   Little Thunder You   re down there two weeks out of each month?  Wheeler I   m there the last two weeks of the month. We also have a one-day  workshop every month in textiles, something that   s going on. It was Inkle  weaving last month. We   ve done a blouse workshop, making a handmade  blouse and stamping in Southeastern. I have a sewing expert that   s going to  come up and do manipulation of fabric that you can put into your clothing or  into your housewares, whatever. She   s going to be teaching that, I believe,  in April. I had my friends from Missouri   that   s been one of my problems.  Because I   ve lived in Missouri I know all the Missouri artists. I   m trying to  learn Oklahoma textile artists that we can start bringing in also so that we   re  bringing experts in. Right now I   m teaching a lot of the workshops, but I  would like to bring a textile person in each month that   s different so we   ll  get new ideas into the studio. It   s exciting. It   s fun.  Little Thunder Sounds wonderful. We   re going to segue a little bit into some techniques, a  little more technical discussion, and then we   ll be finishing up. I was  wondering how important sketching is to your work?  Wheeler I learned, of course, when I was undergraduate, you keep a sketchbook for  everything, and I still do. I have my sketchbooks. When I go to a museum,  I   m constantly sketching. Usually it   s tribal costumes that I   m seeing. I was  probably better at it the first twenty years because I   ve been doing this for  forty years, keeping sketches, and I go back to those. It might be two to  three to four years before I   ll go back and see something, but I continually  go back. They   re my diaries. Now I keep them at each loom. As I   m  weaving, I keep all my records in them, and I have to draw out   . My  drawing skills have gone down the tubes because I don   t keep it up like I  used to, but I think it   s so important to have those sketchbooks. They   re my  diaries of what I   ve done, and I keep my old ones. Now I   m going back and  looking at those ideas when I wasn   t that great of a weaver, when I was  starting out, thinking,    Oh, I could redo that now.    I   d like to take my first  23  couple of years and go back and review and redo some of the things because  I have a lot of sketches in my first books, not as many as I do now.  Sketching is important. I   ve even thought about going back and taking a  class like I used to do.  Little Thunder What   s one of the more unusual fibers that you   ve used?  Wheeler My basic fibers are cottons and silk wool have been the two basic ones. I  have two different companies I order from because I know their quality is  good. When Tencel started being a big thing, I ordered the Tencel for a  while. I love the drape of it, I love the sheen, I love the iridescence I can get  with it, but I didn   t like the longevity of it. I could see it start fuzzing, so I  eliminated it and quit using it. I   ve never used the bamboo. After the Tencel,  I   ve sort of stayed away with fibers because when you   re selling a product,  you want to know how it   s going to last. When I sell something, I have  people coming back that have had a cotton blouse for ten or fifteen years  and it still looks good. If I don   t know the fibers, I   m scared to use them.  The only newest one I have used is a Belgian flax that I found. It   s a linen,  but they call it Belgian flax.  I got it when I was working on the  Chickasaw production  Lowak   Shoppala     costumes because I was wanting a plant fiber that was a little  bit thicker and give that more ancient look to the fabrics. I just fell in love  with working with it. It   s hard to work with in that you have to keep it damp.  I have to keep a spray bottle and damp it, or it   ll break. The finished product  is so great, and the linen will last forever. It   ll only get better as you wash it  and iron it and age. I love that. I used buffalo. That   s a whole different story.  That   s for a workshop. I don   t weave with it that much, but I taught ancient  fiber workshop. I would go out and get the buffalo hide, and I found a man  then who would pull it. It   s better to pull it than shear it off. He would hang  it and let it ripen, and then he would pull and separate the stiffer fibers from  the softer. Then  I would send it to be  cleaned. Then a friend of mine in  Tulsa, Jeannine Glaves, would spin it for me.  I have used that, but I   ve used it in workshops. We do sort of a medicine  bundle out of it, like the Osage medicine bundles. That   s in a workshop that  I do. It   s a five-day workshop, and the first day is the history of cotton  through Native American eyes. The second day is usually the medicine  bundle. The third day, I   ve forgotten. It   s been quite a while since I   ve even  taught this. I was taking from different places. We were going to do the corn  shuck  mask  from the Northeast Coast, and then I was going to do cedar  from the West Coast. Who am I leaving out? I   m leaving out one. I can   t  think. Cotton? Bast fibers, just the bast fibers. The bast fiber workshop. Five  different fibers from five different tribes is what I was trying to do when I  was teaching that workshop.  24  Little Thunder Wow. How do you handle the tag on your clothing for your Mahota? Do you  have a little tag on the inside?  Wheeler Yes, yeah.  Little Thunder Okay.  Wheeler I have    Mahota Handwovens.     Little Thunder Sometimes placing that is   .  Wheeler No, I just do that. Now, on these newer pieces that I   m doing which are  discharge, I   ve made a little stamp with    Mahota,    and I put it with the  discharge, put it on there.  Little Thunder Right, I think we get to see one of those.  Wheeler Yeah, that, I   ve been doing that. No, I have woven tags that I sew into each  garment.  Little Thunder What   s your creative process, starting with how you get your ideas?  Wheeler Research, research, research. Looking at books, looking at magazines. I   m  very visual, so I   m always looking. That   s where the sketchbooks come in.  If you don   t put an idea down, two days later you can   t remember what it  was you were doing. I try to keep notes on ideas. Like the piece I   m working  on right now is the Chickasaw horse. It   s for a show called Return from  Exile: Removal, Relocation, and Resilience, that Southeastern arts group.  It   s supposed to be a traveling show. I just started reading all our Chickasaw  journals about something that had been in our homelands that came with us  that is prominent here that wasn   t here before. I was having a hard time. I  called LaDonna Brown and people within the tribe that are historians, trying  to ask them for ideas, too.  She mentioned some of our myths that were brought that were taught, and  stories and all, but nothing hit until finally there was a whole Chickasaw  journal on the Chickasaw horse. The Chickasaw horse was renowned in the  Southeast and was brought, thousands of them, brought to Indian Territory.  But it fell apart when it came to the resilience because I don   t see thousands  of them here. Then I read that they were the grandfather of the quarter horse  which is the big resilience. So I   m now doing a big headdress of a horse, and  it   s got beadwork on it and a big cape that I have that   ll go with it for that  piece for that show. That   s what I try to do. I was doing a show in  Minneapolis for Convergence, realized their state bird was the loon, so I  started researching loons. Started getting every photograph of a loon,  25  figuring out how on the loom I could do the markings of a loon, and did a  big piece.  I try to see where I   m going to go, where the piece is going to be, how I can  research for that piece, and then how I can do it on the loom, make the  weaving work for it. I love coming up with ideas and figuring out how  they   re going to be done. I was just talking, and I said it wrong. Kachinas  that were out here, I say Shalako Mana. I   m mispronouncing it, but it   s a  Hopi kachina with feathers. I had drawn the kachina in my sketchbook and I  just kept looking at it, and I figured out how I could form a feather in my  weave structure. I made that kachina, and it was shown in San Jose. Again,  it   s keeping sketches, keeping things, trying to figure out how you can make  it work. That   s the fun of it, if it works out. (Laughter) We   re hoping this  horse comes together.  Little Thunder Right, I   m sure it will. Looking back over your career so far, what has been  a fork in the road for you where you could have gone in one direction and  you chose to go another?  Wheeler Probably the meeting with the Chickasaws was one of them because I had  already established myself in the weaving world. I was  in  most of their  fashion shows, I was the end piece, the grand finale. I could always teach,  and when you teach at those big conferences, that   s where people are there  that see you. Then you go out, and you teach all over the United States and,  like I said, Europe and the British Isles. I was established. Going with the  Chickasaws was entirely different, but it felt right. It felt like coming home.  It   s leaving something that   s lucrative, that you   re already established in.  You could just float on, or taking on something that   s really new, going  back into the classroom which I hadn   t done for thirty years, teaching  students. I have not really taught weaving from scratch. I go into guilds and  teach established weavers my style of weaving. Having to start teaching  from scratch, again, I   ve really never taught new weavers how to weave. It   s  been scary, but I think it   s been good for me. Like I said, I feel like I   m  establishing something else that will go on with my name. I can establish the  studio to be there long after I   m gone. That would be an accomplishment.  That   s what my goal is.  Little Thunder What has been one of your career high points so far?  Wheeler Of course, the Heard Show  in Phoenix  and Santa Fe, winning awards  while you   re there, that   s always good. You know that you   re established if  you can win in Santa Fe, win an award, but having a one woman show, that  was a real high point for me. Just being able to do what you love to do is  probably the high point, of having a dream and following it and it   s worked.  I think very few people get that opportunity, so that   s the high point. At this  time in my career, it   s just that I did it. (Laughter) I did it.  26  Little Thunder How about one of your low points?  Wheeler Oh, low points. Gosh, it seems like I   ve had very few low points. Low  points is when you get ill and you can   t   . Like, I had Rocky Mountain  Spotted Tick Fever about three years ago. For eight months, I was down. No  energy, couldn   t work. Had to give up shows. Couldn   t go to the Heard  Market. Couldn   t go to the Eiteljorg Market. Missed seeing friends. You  begin to realize you   re vulnerable. You might eat right, you might exercise,  but you have no control of that that little bug that   s going to bite you. That  was a low point for me, is just no ambition. I was so tired I couldn   t get up  off the divan. It was also a fork in the road. It   s where it made me really  realize what I   ve got to do is get this workshop and leave a legacy if I can.  That would have been the low point, just realizing,    Oh, I can be stopped.     (Laughter)  Little Thunder Is there anything else you   d like to talk about before we look at your  clothing real quickly?  Wheeler Oh, probably that I   m very, very fortunate to have married a man that would  support me while I did my business. When you look at it, I am successful,  very successful on paper, very successful on paper, but if I had to feed  myself and I had to pay rent and I had to pay all the bills, I would   ve still  been teaching school. My husband has stood behind me and believed in  what I was doing. He   s put the food in my mouth and the roof over my head  and let me play. That   s the biggest thing. It   s why I   m here today is that I  was given the opportunity to have someone take care of me. That   s  something else a lot of people don   t get. (Laughter) I   m fortunate. I   m very  fortunate, lucky, lucky.  Little Thunder Well, we   re going to pause and take a look at your work.  Wheeler All right.  Little Thunder Margaret, we   re looking at one of your dresses here.  27  Wheeler This is done with the Belgian flax. It   s a fabric that I love. It   s a bast fiber,  and it really has a texture to it that I don   t see in the wools.  Little Thunder You can really see the texture.  Wheeler Yeah. It is a piece that I had done, sort of like the primitive dress, Native  American dress. All tribes had this style of dress with the poncho. It has the  poncho over, and then there is a dress that   s underneath that   s very plain.  Little Thunder It   s gorgeous.  Wheeler The poncho also has a design. I   m not sure it   s showing in the camera, but  it   s all treadled pattern.  Little Thunder You can see it.  Wheeler There   s a diamond shape that   s real subtle in it. I love sometimes that real,  real subtle   . I like that real subtle, not in-your-face design sometimes that  you can pick up.  28  Little Thunder And abalone shell colors, just the delicate, delicate   .  Wheeler They   ve got soft pinks in them. It   s become one of my favorite fibers to  work with. It   s a difficult fiber to work with, but I love the final product in  it.  Little Thunder It   s just beautiful.  Wheeler This is almost like a buckskin dress like that. I show it. I have one  photograph that shows it with one of my Chickasaw hunting coats and the  pouch that   s made out of the same type of fabric.  Little Thunder How neat.  Wheeler It   s sort of a man   s outfit, and this was the female outfit.  Little Thunder Right, you   ve got the little design going towards the hand there, too.  Wheeler Right, and it   s got twisted fringe that I   ve become sort of noted for. I twist a  lot of fringe. That kind of fringe is more substantial. It won   t wear out as  quickly.  Little Thunder Okay. How about this?  Wheeler These are a new line of clothing that I   m doing. Since all the looms are in  Sulphur, in Joplin I   ve got to have something to do when I go, so I   m doing  29  a lot of handwork and embroidery. This is the Mississippian flying serpents  that we find on pottery sometimes. They   re sort of a symbol, and there   s  also a myth that goes with them. I   d called LaDonna Brown when I was  working on the Return from Exile, trying to get ideas for that. She told me  about the flying serpents and that her grandfather was telling her that story  that had come from the homelands, but they were telling those same stories  here and that he was up in one of the ponds near their house. It was this  mythical creature. That has come with us over the years of keeping our  stories. I decided not to do this as one of my big pieces, but I loved the idea,  so this is a tribute to LaDonna Brown for suggesting that to me. It   s on  organic cotton that I   m getting. It   s grown in Texas, so it   s a very local  product.  Little Thunder Beautiful shade of blue. I love the way it hangs.  Wheeler It   s neat, these designs that are coming off the pottery from the  Mississippians. To see so many artists using   you   re seeing the potters use  them now, the jewelers, shell carvings. We   re really having a resurgence in  the Southeastern arts that   s so exciting. We   re seeing our symbolism rather  than so much of the Southeastern symbolism now.  Little Thunder All right.  Wheeler This is my version of a man   s ribbon shirt. They   ve been a fairly good seller.  It   s woven ribbon rather than one that   s attached. Then, the top I tried to sort  30  of do ribbon techniques in the weave structure of it. I   ve done quite a few  men   s things. I do jackets, and I do these shirts. I have another shirt that I do  that is not like the ribbon shirt. Men are harder sells, sometimes.  Little Thunder And harder to size, I would think, in a way, too.  Wheeler Yes, right. I have this one here at this show, and then I have one that   s extra,  extra large out there. It   s in the Tencel. This one is a medium, but it   s my  version of the ribbon shirt. In it you can also see, if you look at the  horizontal lines going through it, I   m sort of noted for the style of warping  that I do. I use five threads when I   m warping, and I use generally different  colors. All five, I might have two cones of one color and then variations so  that I get this variated stripe. I refer to it like a painter that   s painting. He  doesn   t take it straight out of the tube. He mixes color. The eye can visually  mix, so with the yarns I try to do that in a painterly technique. I also  sometimes will change a whole color. Like you see the stripe going through  later, that   s all in the warp. That is something I like to do is to bring my  painting and my sculpting into the weaving world, those things that you  learn.  Little Thunder It   s gorgeous. I   m going to try and get closer up on that. Oh, I see the five.  It   s wonderful. Thank you so much for your time today.  Wheeler Oh, thank you.  -------  -------
