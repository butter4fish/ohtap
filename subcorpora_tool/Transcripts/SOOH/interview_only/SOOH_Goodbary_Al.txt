 Hargis, president of Oklahoma State University and today  we   re here interviewing, doing what we call an oral history with  General Al Goodbary. General Goodbary comes from a long line of  OSU folks. His parents were W. Allan and Dorris Goodbary who  finished their time here on earth in Carney, Oklahoma. Is that correct?  That is correct.  Okay. And they graduated from here in 1941?     41.  And Henry Bellmon, who we   re going to talk about today, graduated in     42. So they were roughly the same age.  Same generation.  Were they friends, do you know?  I   m not aware of them being friends then, but shortly thereafter or later  on in their careers, they became very close friends.  Your parents were one of five couples that were selected by President  Henry Bennett to start the agricultural portion of the Point Four  Program, which we call USAID, today.  That   s correct, sir.  Most people may know that President Bennett was named head of the  Point Four Program by President Harry Truman at its formation in the  5  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  late    40s.  Right, the fourth point of his foreign aid   or, state department.  Yeah, I always thought it may refer to the four points of the compass, but  really, it was the fourth thing he talked about. (Laughter) Let   s talk a  little bit about Al Goodbary, though. Describe your background for us.  Sure. My folks made it very simple for me to come to OSU. They said I  could go anywhere I wanted, but the checks were coming to Stillwater. I  came here in 1960. Went in the Army for two years in    65 and came out  thirty-one years later.  What did you major in here at OSU?  I majored in accounting and auditing.  But you were obviously in ROTC, I assume?  ROTC cadet and I guess you could call it a minor in military history or a  minor in military.  Take us through some of the highlights of that thirty-one year career in  the military.  Well, I started off in the Airborne Division, which is always exciting for  a young lieutenant     Jumping out of airplanes     Jumping out of airplanes, perfectly good ones. At that time, Vietnam  was just getting started so I found myself in two consecutive tours in  Vietnam.  What were you doing in Vietnam?  I was an adviser to the Vietnamese the first tour and then came back and  went to flight school to fly helicopters, only because at that time it was  part of infantry. Second tour, I was an aviator in Vietnam.  So you flew helicopters?  Yes, sir.  I see. Any close calls during that period?  6  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  I think every day is a close call in combat in helicopters. (Laughter)  Right, right. And then where did you spend the bulk of the rest of your  time?  I think the bulk of the time you could almost say in between various  short tours around the country, I spent, off and on, fifteen years in the  Washington, DC area, off and on. So the bulk of it, you could say,  Washington, DC.  So your branch was infantry?  It was infantry and then later we had to designate a secondary so  personnel management. So I went to our personnel center in  Washington, DC for two tours and then spent three tours in the Pentagon  and one as a White House Fellow with FEMA. Then the National War  College fell in there. So we had multiple tours, multiple assignments  while in Washington DC.  What was your highest rank?  The highest rank, I guess you could say was Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense, which would be about a three-star equivalent, but I was only  promoted to two-star in a military rank system.  When were you promoted to two-star general?  It would have been in 1992 or    93.  You were first promoted as a one-star brigadier.  One-star and stayed there for three years and then went to a two-star and  stayed there for at least three years. Had to stay three to retire as a two-star.  You did retire, and what happened?  Retired in 1996 and then obviously you start looking for your post-retirement  position     Next chapter of your life.  Next chapter   fortunately, it came about as having come back to  Oklahoma the year before and made a speech down at OU  University of  Oklahoma  on distance learning and those kind of things and someone  from OSU was there and asked if I was going to retire soon and I said,    I  7  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  have no idea.    They said,    Well, when you get ready, give us a call.    In  fact, I did that. Lo and behold, the job was still available and I came  back and went to work in the Vice-President for Research   s office on  government contracts.  I see. So your wife is Shirley     Shirley. Met her in school here.  Here and when were you married?  In 1962.  I see.  I still remember that date.  Yeah, actually, it   s best you do. Especially the day and month. The year  might not be quite as critical. (Laughter)  Yeah, let   s try 2 June.  Yeah. Yeah, good. Any children?  I have two boys and six grandchildren.  Oh, that   s great. That   s great. Any of them go to OSU?  Both of our kids went to OSU. In fact, we have now eighteen graduates  in our extended family who are OSU graduates.  When you retired, were your parents still in Carney?  They were. They were in good health, and we fortunately got to enjoy  seven or eight good years with them before they passed on.  They were remarkable people. They traveled all over the world     They did and it   s an education that none of us could ever replace.  Did they stay with the Point Four Program, or USAID, all those years?  They did. When he finally retired, he was actually serving in Africa, at  the time in 1973, when he retired.  I see. I can recall being at their home and the wonderful array of  8  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  artifacts and souvenirs and acquisitions they   ve made around the world.  Indeed and in fact a lot of those went to   divided amongst the six kids.  They had six kids, by the way.  What were they doing primarily in these countries? What was the real  function?  His real function was in the agricultural bit, having majored in animal  husbandry here at Oklahoma A M. In later years, as he became more  senior, he was on the ambassador   s country team as the food and  agriculture officer or deputy for food and agriculture officer for the  ambassador.  I see. As I said at the onset, we could do a whole oral history on your  folks     I think we could. (Laughs)  And probably should. But one thing I know that you were dear friends,  as were your parents, with Governor, Senator Henry Bellmon. What is  your first memory of meeting Henry Bellmon?  I think my first real memory was when I first came here. I had not met  him before I retired. I had always voted for him by absentee ballot when  I was in the Army.  Why was that?  Because my parents ensured that I knew all about him.  How did they become friends?  They became friends, when my dad retired in 1973, of course while he  was with the government, he couldn   t be in the political world very  much, but once he retired from the federal government, it was very clear  to him that he wanted to make sure that his party, your party, my party  continued well and     Talking about the Republican Party.  Republican Party. And that just happened to be Henry Bellmon   s party  and they wanted to make sure he was successful in anything that he did,  at anything that he ran for. So they became very close friends, then.  He was a U.S. Senator by then?  9  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Yes.  But going back, Henry Bellmon was, of course, in the legislature when  he came home from the war in the    40s. He was defeated after his very  first term. Ended up becoming chairman of the Republican Party in the  late    50s. I guess he had somehow run into Barry Goldwater. I can  remember doing an oral history with Henry, here, and he talked about  going out and learning about how you organize a state for a party and  he did that for the Republican Party, but then he couldn   t find anybody  to run for governor, absolutely hopeless, and he did it.  Right and     That was about the time you were graduating from college?  That   s correct. I graduated    65 and I think he     Or going to college, I should say.  Going to college, right.  So did you first meet him later in   ?  I first physically met him, really, when I retired in    96.  Really? And what was that occasion?  That occasion is he had an office upstairs on the second floor here.  Second floor of Whitehurst?  Whitehurst. He was working for the vice-president for research as well,  and I moved into that office and shared the same suite, and we shared  the same executive assistant and that great lady stayed with us for a  long, long time, until we both left.  Of course, he was a legislator, he was a chairman, he was a governor,  he was a two-term senator, he was a director of DHS, he was head of the  Cowboy Hall of Fame   just a countless number of titles. What did you  call him?  I always called him Governor because that   s what he wanted to be  called   or farmer, but I didn   t think farmer sounded so good.  Farmer Bellmon, huh?  10  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  I always called him Governor unless we were in Washington, DC  together. Then it was Senator.  The funny thing that Lamar Alexander told me, the senator from  Tennessee, who was an aid to Howard Baker. He was a young guy right  out of school and he had gone to a Republican Senate caucus meeting.  Various senators kept calling this guy Governor and,    Well, what do  you think, Governor?    So on the way back to the Russell Office  Building, Alexander asked Baker,    What was a governor doing in the  Senate caucus meeting?    Baker said,    Lamar, that   s Senator Bellmon  from Oklahoma.    He said,    Well, why would you be calling him  Governor?    He said,    Young man, once you   ve been a governor, you  don   t want to be called anything else.     And that   s what Governor Bellmon always said, too. He said,    Why  would I want to be anything else?     (Laughter) Yeah, I always thought the whole time he was in the Senate,  he   d just as soon be back here on the farm in Oklahoma.  Well, every time we went to a public event or someone would   we   d go  around the room and introduce ourselves. He   d always introduce himself  as Henry Bellmon, farmer. That was it.  Right. Did you ever work in his campaigns?  I did not, but my parents did.  Yeah, your dad had that big papier-m  ch   elephant, which he loaned to  me when I ran for governor.  He took it to everything he could.  That   s great. What are some of your memories about working with  Henry? Just talk about the man, the personality and so on.  Every day that I had the privilege to work with him was a history lesson  in some way, shape or form. Non-pretentious, wonderfully honest,  always candid. You never had a doubt where he stood on any issue  whatsoever.  I can remember during one of his campaigns   I can   t remember what  the issue was, but it was something we were worried about and we were  going to get negative press and four or five of us were sitting around  with him and saying,    Well, you know, we could say this,    somebody  11  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  else,    We could say that,       How about we spin it this way?    Finally,  Bellmon said,    Well, let   s not immediately rule out the truth.     (Laughs) Exactly. That   s what I mean by    you always got the truth from  him.     So when he was a senator, I guess you didn   t have any direct dealings  with him?  No direct dealings, just knew who he was     You were in Washington     I was in Washington.  Was he considered a friend of the military?  He was. He was always considered a friend of the military.  He   d won the Silver Star as a Marine.  You never necessarily took his vote for granted.  No, you could never take his votes for granted. (Laughs)  As was seen in the Panama Canal vote     Yeah, I   ve seen him in a lot of things like that. Share a few memorable  moments with him.  There   s so many. Let   s see   since we did do a lot together, and we did it  both at the federal level and the state level. We spent a lot of time on the  highway here in Oklahoma. A lot of airtime, actually going to and from  Washington. He certainly knew where every chicken fried steak place  there was in Oklahoma.  And Mexican food. He was pretty good at Mexican food.  And Mexican food. We never missed an opportunity to stop at those  places. Always en route, there was always a history lesson in some way,  shape, or form, either his dealings with the alcohol guys when liquor  started to get legal in Oklahoma, how he dealt with some of the bribe  attempts he had. It was just a wonderful lesson in history and ethics  more than anything else. Every once in a while he   d like to drive. Not  often, but occasionally. We wore suits, or at least I did, at that time.  You   d normally try to wear a pretty clean one each day, but sometimes  12  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  when he wanted to drive, and you   d get to his truck, and you   d kind of  have to ask him where in the world he   s been with it.    The windows do  roll up, don   t they?    He said,    Well, yeah, but you know       It would be  muddy and be dusty and gritty and dirty. He got a new truck one day,  and we went out there to get in it, and it was just bent to heck. I said,     Governor, this truck is only a week or two old,    I said,    What in the  world have you done?    He said,    Well, one of my cows got loose, and I  had to chase it through the trees.     In the pickup? (Laughter)  In the pickup. So here is this brand new Dodge pickup just beat to heck.  You know, during this time, his second term as governor, which began     86-1990, then he chose not to run for re-election. He couldn   t run for  re-election in the    60s. The law did not permit it. Had you asked the  legislature for money to fund economic development? I think Bellmon  had done that, too.  Bellmon had done that.  Like 170 million for an economic development program     And I think it was to place these various economic development nodes  around the state.  President Halligan, I guess, emphasized that this was not an OSU  initiative.  Right, and it wasn   t. In fact, later on we went back and met with  Governor Keating, and Governor Bellmon at that time said,    I think it   s  time for me to review some of the things that I maybe approved and put  in place.    Governor Keating said,    Well, that may be a good idea.    The  idea was to go back and if it didn   t make any sense, we   d report back  and maybe he   d kill it, because Governor Bellmon saw some of these  things, as far as he could see, they weren   t doing a lot of ROI, return on  investment. I don   t remember exactly why we never got to that. It may  have been things like 9/11 and some of the things that ensued afterward.  I don   t remember, but we did not do that. He wanted so much to go back  and review some of the educational programs as well as some of the  economic development programs that he had put together while he  had     Was that done?  To my knowledge, no. We did not do it, even though we had gone and  13  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  asked permission to move forward on it. It may have been a switch in  funding levels. I just can   t remember why we didn   t pursue it, but we  didn   t.  I see. My wife, when I was a regent here, talking about Bellmon being  here on campus. His then-wife, Eloise, was saying that Henry was  leaving real early in the morning because he didn   t have a parking place  here. So my wife called me and just chewed me out about it.    How in the  world?    because she was in love with Henry Bellmon     Well, we fixed that. (Laughter)  She called me and said,    That   s outrageous that he has to fight for a  parking place up here.    He always would drive up here real early in the  morning so he   d have a parking   because for Henry, getting up early  wasn   t any chore.  Right, he could have just done some more in the field before he came in.  My memory of working for him is if he sat down and was quiet for two  minutes, he was sound asleep.  He was sound asleep, but many people mistook that as him not paying  attention. He could come out of that, what we thought was a slumber,  and ask a pointed question that would just zing you. People would come  at me later and say,    I thought he was asleep?    I said,    That was your  first mistake.     He told me the story of going to church on a snowy morning and there  were only about five people in the church, and the minister got up there  and talked for an hour on his sermon. When it was all over, he came up  to Bellmon and said,    Governor, did you not like my sermon? I noticed  you slept through the whole thing.    He said,    Well, it was too long.        You think it was too long?    he said,    Yeah, it was too long. When I go  out to feed the cows and only three calves show up, I don   t give them the  whole bale.    (Laughter)  That   s classic Bellmon.  So you got him a parking place?  We did get him a parking place. I say    we.    It got done.  Yeah. Now when you were here and working with him, did you all do  any work in Washington and try to garner department of defense grants  or other relationships?  14  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  We did. We were up there quite a bit, in fact. We would meet   and this  was what was so powerful with him because he knew and was accepted  on both sides of the aisle. So it was not unusual for us to sit down with a  Democratic senator and a Republican senator on the same trip, asking  for support on the same project.  This was support for OSU or for the state of Oklahoma?  Mostly for OSU, at that time.  What would be an example of some of the things?  Well, an example would be the start of what you now may remember as  the ASSET Program. It started off as the CATT program   that was one  of his dreams.    How can I use excess talent in Oklahoma that went belly  up during the oil bust, and how can I take those talented machinists and  people who know how to build things and make parts for aging  systems?    So we put together a program that was funded and still being  funded. I don   t necessarily agree that it should still be funded. I think  that should maybe eventually be on its own, but nonetheless, it   s still  being funded under a different name.  Called the ASSET Program.  Called the ASSET Program.  Aging Aircraft     Aging Systems Sustainment Enabling Technologies.  And it   s designed to match machinists, and the like, to produce parts for  airplanes     Aging systems, right. Primarily at Tinker.     that have long since gone out of production.  That or original equipment manufacturers, that   s correct. So there was a  lot of support for that and it   s changed its focus a little bit over the years,  but it never changed the fact that we wanted to use Oklahoma  manufacturers, small businesses to build those parts. He was an avid  supporter for that.  And that   s interesting, isn   t it? Because he   s no longer governor, no  longer senator, certainly didn   t need to work, he had the farm up there.  15  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Had plenty to do.  Had plenty to do and yet he still had this passion for helping Oklahoma.  He had passion for Oklahoma, he had passion for its people, and he had  passions for the department of defense. Those things, when you put that  in one person, you get a powerful force. We would go up there three or  four times a year minimum and just walk the halls for two or three days  and come home.  Yeah, he and I went up there in   oh, it   d have been between probably in     87 or    88 and met there in the Roosevelt Room in the White House with  Bush and, elder Bush, and the secretary of HEW on an idea for  Oklahoma to change its Medicaid plan to more of an HMO. He got that  appointment no problem.  It   s amazing.  People really respected his independence. He could make you madder  than a hornet, sometimes, but it didn   t bother him.  It didn   t bother him a bit. That continued, too. Even later, we wanted to  go down and brief OSU   s ethanol program to Bush 44     43.  43. And so it was just, he said,    Well, that   s no problem. I   ll just call  Joe.    Well, it was Joe Allbaugh who started out as Bellmon   s driver.  I hired him.  Oh, right, exactly     And of course, Joe, just for the oral history, Joe Allbaugh then got into  campaign management, and he was brought in late in George W. Bush   s  campaign for governor against Ann Richards. At the time, he was  looking pretty sorry. Not he, George W. Bush, his campaign. Joe came  in and basically managed that campaign to victory, and then he  managed his campaign for president in 2000 and managed the Florida  recount and alike and then became FEMA director at the time 9/11  occurred. He   s also an OSU grad, I might add. Joe Allbaugh.  Oh, I know. We met with him frequently on other things, too. In fact,  Joe was at one of Governor Bellmon   s birthday parties up on the farm  here, two or three years before he passed away.  16  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Yeah, I was there.  Oh, that   s right you were there. You and Ann were both there.  I lost a camera that day. I never have found that camera.  Is that right? (Laughs) Maybe the girls have it.  I don   t know, I   ve asked them. (Laughs) Did you ever see him mad?  Oh, I   ve seen him mad, but it was   I knew he was mad. I don   t think it  was a case where most people would have interpreted it as they were  getting a real brow-beating, but they were, but you could tell, he   d get a  little bit red. You could tell he was mad.  What made him mad?  I guess the things that would make him the maddest would be people  that   he was so disciplined and had respect for authority, but not  overbearing authority. In other words, if someone said they would do  something or someone asked them to do something and they agreed to  and they didn   t do it, that would just really get him off on a tangent.  Because that   s someone   s word and their bond not holding true. That  would get him about as mad as anything.  He did. Now he was a religious man, wasn   t he?  He had, I think, deep faith, but he didn   t wear it. I always respected him  for that. You knew that he had attended church most of the time, but you  also knew that when he didn   t for some reason it didn   t upset him,  because his faith was strong, and you don   t have to go to the house or  the building or listen to that one-hour preacher to get the point.  You mentioned that party up at the farm. What was it called, Twin Rocks  or     Turtle Rock.  Turtle Rock, yeah, I think that   s what he called it. There were people  there, lots of people, who had been with Henry Bellmon for thirty, forty  years     Exactly.  What do you think engendered that kind of loyalty that he seemed to  17  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  receive from so many people?  I think from the way he treated people. He just treated them as an equal  human being. I think people felt comfortable with him. They respected  him for his position, but they also respected him for looking at them just  as an individual.  He wasn   t a particularly affectionate kind of person     He didn   t go around hugging, no.  Oh, no.  He was just nice.  And he was pretty serious. Not a lot of small talk with Henry.  Not a lot, but we sure have had some fun times when he   s come to our  house for dinner in Edmond. He came there many times, and every once  in a while, he would even be the blunt of a good birthday joke or  something and he would get into a good laugh or     He didn   t drink at all. In fact, when he was in the governor   s mansion,  they   d serve sparking grape juice or something like that.  Yeah, he would say give me a little bit of red, but he   d never touch it.  No, but apparently Eloise, toward the end, got him taking maybe a glass  of wine every night.  I think Eloise did get him to take a little bit more towards the end.  (Laughter)  But he certainly was not a drinker.  No, he was not.  I don   t remember him cussing much. Every now and then, you might  hear a    damn,    but that was pretty much     But I think that   s   he would say, and I have a lot of people   I say a  lot   some of them, I feel like the same way. He would say that most  people who cuss all the time just don   t know how to say it right. Why do  that? Every once in a while, as you say, for emphasis or when he   s really  mad, you might hear a    damn.     18  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  He was somewhat like Will Rogers when he said,    I never met a man I  didn   t like.    But there were men he didn   t like.  Oh, there were.  One of them was Ted Kennedy.  Better believe it. (Laughs)  I think he was gone by the time Ted Kennedy got sick, and I   m sure he  would have had empathy for his family, but he didn   t have much use for  Ted Kennedy.  No, no, he did not at all. I can   t remember, there were a couple others  that he spoke about, but I can   t even remember who those are, but you   re  right, there are very few.  Very few.  Even his most vicious opponents at the Oklahoma capitol, he would go  sit down in their office, and I   d be with him frequently, and you knew  they were just diametrically opposed to every issue. It was always a  friendly chat back and forth.  He seemed to have a quality that we don   t have much of in Congress  today and that was he was able to find a middle ground that an outside  critic would kind of simply call it compromise, but he really could seem  to be able to find, sometimes, a middle ground that made everybody  reasonably satisfied. Maybe not happy, but satisfied.  Not happy, but they understood it and they were satisfied, that   s right.  That   s a good description.  I think he would look at some of the things going on today and just feel  like, you know, you   re never going to get everything you want. What  you   ve got to do is have it   330 gets you in the Hall of Fame in  baseball. Batting .330. So if you get a third of what you want, you might  have done okay. (Laughter)  A good friend, who we   ve seen recently, Simpson, very good friend of  Bellmon, they   re very similar in nature on compromising     You   re talking about the senator from Wyoming?  Yes. They were very close. We would meet with him occasionally when  we   d go to     19  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Alan Simpson.  Alan Simpson.  Yeah, yeah. That   s right. Well, when history is written on Henry  Bellmon, what do you hope it will include?  I hope the history, it may not, just because of the lack of celebrity status,  but I would like to see him put on the same level as a Will Rogers as  someone that everybody liked. Nobody disliked him. I don   t think  anybody really truly disliked him for the same qualities that you just  mentioned. I   d like to think he   d be known as, I don   t know whether this  is the right term, but we use the term populous and that   s someone who  kind of goes down the middle. He just did what was right. I think he  voted his conscience to do what was right for people at the time. He  would always say,    History will tell you whether I was right or wrong.     Yeah. I know he didn   t read polls. He wasn   t very interested in polls.  No, he couldn   t care less.  He was going to do what he thought was right, and he always felt like, if  you don   t do that, what do you need with representatives? Everybody  just cast a vote on every bill and that   s what it will be. You don   t need to  spend all this money on chambers and all that stuff.  Absolutely.     I think people send me up here to use my judgment to do the best for  my district in the country as I can.     And hopefully they would trust him to do that.  You certainly couldn   t buy him.  No way. In fact, he talks about the time someone came in with what was  reported to be twenty-five thousand dollars in cash in a bag. That was  this liquor thing. They wanted to make sure they bought his support as  governor. He said,    You   re talking to the wrong person. You   re in the  wrong room.    They left. They couldn   t believe it.  Was he around at all when the University Multispectral Lab  UML  was  conceived?  No. He was alive, but not around here.  20  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Yeah, around here?  He was not here.  He would have been very interested in it.  Oh, he always was. In fact, he would always call me and say,    Are you  going to be in Ponca?    or,    Are you going to be where we can meet  halfway for lunch?    so we would try to do that. If I was going to be at  Ponca for a day or something, we   d come back through Stillwater and  we   d always meet at the Cherokee Strip Barbecue. That was his favorite  haunt. He was interested in the UML and we tried to keep him up to date  until the very last. He was proud of that, though.  Well, that   s great. I think I   ve kind of covered this. A lot of these  questions were around his campaigns and     Yeah, and I was not, unfortunately. There   s one other thing that he was  real proud of and it may be part of history. Do you remember the  Oklahoma Alliance for Public Policy Research? He did that as a  governor and he wanted to say   his point was,    There   s not one single  university in this state that   s big enough to do things on their own, but if  you put them all together       At that time, it was three, OU, OSU and  OU Health Sciences, I mean Tulsa. The three research universities. So  he formed that and he kept that as a 501(c)3, and when I came on board  in    96, he said,    I want you to help me run that,    even as an ex-governor.  So we brought in OU Health Sciences Center as the fourth research  university to bring all four research arms of this state into one alliance  for public policy research. The things they tried to do, they were very  successful. They just didn   t do it very much.  What were some of the things they tried to do?  The thing that I remember the latest, it was a prison study. They all went  and got their collective expertise out of their universities and put  together a very nice prison study that I think dealt with incarceration,  lengths of time, those kinds of things. His vision for it was to do a lot  more and he just had a hard time getting it through the bureaucracies,  particularly down south.  (Laughter) On that note     It was difficult.  On that note, we   ll wrap this up. But Al, thank you very much.  21  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  Hargis  Goodbary  My pleasure.  Great history with Oklahoma State University, you and your family, and  also with one of the great Oklahomans of all time, Henry Bellmon.  I agree and fortunately for me, my history continues even in retirement.  Indeed. You were nice to allow us to interview you for posterity and we  appreciate it.  Thank you Mr. President. Thanks.  -------  -------
