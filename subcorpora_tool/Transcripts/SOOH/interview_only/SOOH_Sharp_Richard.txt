 Myers and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is April 11, 2012 and I   m in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma  meeting at the home of Richard Sharp. I   ll be interviewing Richard  today as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Thank you for taking time to  meet here today with me.  You   re welcome. Thank you.  Richard, can you tell me a little bit about where you went to school and  a little bit of your background before the marines.  Yes. I grew up in Whiting, Indiana and attended Whiting High School.  Graduated from there in 1947. Joined the marine corps in February of     48 and attended Indiana University for a short period and Tulsa  Community College, where I studied Chinese language.  Now, that was much later, as far as the studying Chinese language.  That was much later, but I did attend Southeastern Louisiana in  Hammond, Louisiana for one semester.  What kind of work did you do before joining the marines, or were you in  high school at the time?  No, for a short period I worked at Youngstown Sheet and Tube, a steel  mill. I was in the metallurgical lab.  Okay. Okay. What prompted you to join the marines?  I fell in love with the marine corps when I was thirteen years old, and  that   s all I ever thought of doing was becoming a marine.  5  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Was there a specific job or function in the marines that you wanted to  serve?  Yes, I wanted to go to C School. Of course, they told me I was perfect,  but that was a recruiter and I never saw Sea School. (Laughter)  What exactly, for those of us who don   t know, what exactly is C School?  It   s marines that are assigned to ships to man the guns and also to kind  of be a servant to the captain of the ship. So, standing guard in his  quarters and so forth.  I see. So, you didn   t get to go to C School.  No.  You volunteered.  Yes, I did.  What age were you when you volunteered?  I just turned eighteen.  Just eighteen, okay. How was the induction process for you? How did  that go?  The induction, I really joined in Gary, Indiana, but since they took me to  Chicago to swear me in I   m considered to be a Chicago inductee.  (Laughs) Like I say, I really joined in Gary, Indiana, near my home.  So, you were inducted there. How did you transport? Did you go to  Pendleton from there?  No, I went to Paris Island, South Carolina for boot training and went  through boot camp from February of    48 to   oh, I spent a year at Paris  Island. Then they transferred me to the First Marine Division.  Okay. So, when you transported to Paris Island, was that by train from  Chicago?  By train, yes.  How long of a trip was that?  6  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Oh, it was only eighteen hours, something like that.  Not too bad.  Not too bad. But when we got to Buford, where the receiving barracks  was, they put us on a train that backed into Paris Island. I thought,     Now, this isn   t too good if they have to back the train in.    (Laughter)  So you got to Paris Island. How long was your boot training?  Three months. Three months of hell.  Okay, can you kind of go through, just detail what occurred back then?  I   m sorry, what?  Can you detail, for those who don   t know, what boot training was like  back then?  It was very tough, very tough. They tried to break you mentally and  physically, which sounds brutal but it had its purposes, because if a guy  was going to break, it   d be better for him to break in boot camp than in  combat and have his buddies maybe killed or so. But boot camp was  extremely difficult.  So, at boot camp, is that where everyone learned to fire the BRM, or fire  weapons at that time?  Yes, I fired the   qualified with the M1 Garand, which I think is the  finest weapon that ever was designed. (Laughter)  How many rounds did that hold, the M1?  How many rounds?  Yes.  We fired eighty rounds for qualification.  My goodness. That   s quite a bit. After qualifying, what kind of training,  specific training, did you have to go through at boot camp that you  recall?  Oh, it was a lot of marching, a lot of running, a lot of saying,    Yes, sir.  No, sir,    to everything and everyone. So, it was quite an experience.  7  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  A lot of drilling ceremonies, then.  Oh, yes. Yes.  Did they teach many tactics at that point in time?  No, not at that point.  Where did you pick up your tactical training?  At Pendleton. Camp Pendleton. I was squad leader of the First Squad in  boot camp so I kind of got a taste of being in charge at that period.  So after boot camp, did you retain that squad leader position when you  went to your secondary training?  No, I didn   t.  Okay. And that was at Pendleton after that, correct?  Pardon?  Your continuing training after boot camp was at Pendleton?  Yes.  So at Pendleton, that   s actually where you learned your military job?  Yes, at Pendleton.  What was your military job at that time that they were training you for?  Machine guns, light, thirty-caliber machine guns.  So that   s what you carried for the remainder of the time in the service?  Yes. Right.  Was that a tripod-mounted or ground-mounted?  It was tripod-mounted. I   ve got to go back a little bit. I misstated  something, there. I was actually, at first, a stretcher bearer. So, the  training there was not very difficult. Picked the guy up and lugged him  off the hill. (Laughs) But later on, we became machine gunners, light  thirty.  8  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  So how long was that training at Pendleton?  I had been there a year and a half when Korea started.  What unit were you assigned to there at Pendleton prior to the war?  At Pendleton?  Yes.  We were part of the Seventh Marines, three-seven. Third Battle  Battalion, Seventh Marines.  Okay. So, tell me a little bit about, I guess, what you perceived as maybe  the attitude of yourself and your fellow marines, and even any civilians  you might have known at that time, in the run-up to the Korean War,  whenever it looked like things were going to kick off over there.  Oh, we were gung-ho, ready to go. Oh, yes. Just a lot of excitement. We  were finally getting to do the job we had been prepared for. I think guys  were actually fighting each other for berths to go to Korea. (Laughter)  So, from my research, I know that the US Military had kind of been  downsized after World War II.  Yes, it had been.  So, as far as equipment, were you lacking in any equipment or anything  like that prior to heading out?  I think the marine corps is always lacking in equipment, because we get  what the navy doesn   t want. (Laughs) But as far as ammunition and  weapons and all, we were well taken care of.  So what day did you find out you were heading to Korea? Do you  remember what date that was, roughly?  Yes, well, I left August 16 and I probably knew two weeks before that,  that we would be going.  That was August 16, 1950?  Yes, of    50. Right.  So you knew a couple weeks prior to that.  9  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Oh, yes. Yes.  So August 16, you   re boarding boats to head out     We   re boarding ships. (Laughs)  What kind of ships brought you over?  APAs, attack transports.  How long was that trip coming over?  Sixteen days.  Sixteen days, my goodness.  Yes, we docked at Kobe, Japan and reloaded the ships for a combat  landing. Got back on the ships and took off for Korea and arrived there  on September 15.  So, you arrived September 15. During your transport over, prior to  reaching Kobe, Japan, was there any continued training?  No, there wasn   t. Some of the guys did   a lot of the fellows were  reservists. They   d never fired the M1 or any weapon. They did have  some training for the fellows who would fire off the ship and get a little  bit familiar with the weaponry.  So, that training, was that primarily conducted by the regular marines?  Oh, yes, by regular marines.  How about your sleeping quarters on those ships headed over?  The what?  Your sleeping quarters on the ships headed over. How were those?  (Laughter)  They were six   we were stacked six high. There was just about enough  room, and you had your sea bag in between your legs. Everybody had  their sea bags. These things were six high. So you wanted to try to get  one of the lower bunks because it was quite a chore to get up to the sixth  rack.  I   ll bet. Were you hot racking it? Were there guys in the racks during the  10  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  day that would rotate out or anything like that?  No, no. We did not do that. I slept topside. I didn   t want to be down  below quarters. So, I   d sneak up and sleep under a landing boat or  something. (Laughs)  I see. Did many of your fellow marines do that? Kind of get out of the   ?  I don   t think a lot of them did, but I certainly did.  So, you landed in Kobe and sixteen days later, you   re heading out for  Korea.  For Inchon, right. The invasion of Inchon.  Let   s talk about that for a little while.  Okay.  What were the preparations like, getting ready for that battle of Inchon?  Not a whole lot. We   d been trained thoroughly back in the States, except  for the reservists. A lot of them just went in cold.  Okay.  Now, climbing those nets, that   s where the danger is. They didn   t let us  go up gang plates. We had to climb up and down the nets, the landing  nets. That   s quite a chore when you   ve got a weapon on your shoulder  and your ammunition and helmet on.  What was your combat load for ammunition? How much ammunition  would you be carrying?  I had ten rounds and a cartridge belt. I   m sorry. Ten clips.  Ten full clips and a cartridge belt.  Ten full clips. And then in Korea, we had bandoliers, too, that had like  another eight clips per bandolier.  Okay. About twenty rounds per clip?  Eight. Eight rounds per clip, for the M1.  Okay. And those were just inserted from the topside, down.  11  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Yes. That   s where the term,    M1 thumb,    came from because you had to  push it down and if you didn   t get your thumb out of there, it would  really whack you good. (Laughs)  Get struck by the bolt?  Yes. (Laughter)  Okay, so, let   s take a look here. So, you   re trained as a machine gunner.  Can you tell me a little bit about the men you served with, the men you  arrived there in Inchon with?  I had been with most of them for up to three years, or two and a half  years, all the way back to Paris Island, and then all of them at Pendleton  for probably a year. So, we were very, very close-knit.  Do you recall any of their names?  Oh, good lord, yes.  Any of them you   d like to talk about here?  Gene Holland.  Gene Holland?  Yes. He was my dearest friend. He was killed at the  Chosin  Reservoir.  My son is named for him.  I see. Anyone else?  Yes, there   s just scats of them. Like I say, we   d been together for, some,  up to three years with some of the guys. But Gene was my best friend.  What was his function? What was his job?  He was a machine gunner.  Machine gunner, also?  Yes, he was killed on my gun.  I see. How did that occur?  It was between Hagaru and Koto-ri, where the Chinese hit us really hard.  12  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  During the fight, I don   t know if it was a mortar round or a grenade or  what, but I heard him when he got hit. I was maybe ten feet away, and I  heard him say,    Ough, I think I   m hit,    and he died. He was only twenty  years old.  Where was he from, do you remember?  He was from California, Pasadena. Wonderful boy. His family, though,  were from Oklahoma. He was part Choctaw Indian.  I see. I see. That makes sense that him being from California and part  Oklahoman. He may have had relatives that headed out during the Dust  Bowl.  Yes. Yes.  Okay. So, let   s step back just a bit to the battle of Inchon and start there,  and then we can move forward to the Battle of Chosin. How long were  you engaged in the battle, there, at Inchon?  At Inchon? It was over   it really was two battles. The original one was  Wolmido, which was an island guarding the harbor at Inchon. The Fifth  Marines went in and took Wolmido, and we went in two days later to  Inchon and immediately got on trucks and went toward Seoul. We  recaptured Seoul after that.  How long was that process, as far as the battles in Seoul to take Seoul  down?  Probably two to three weeks.  So, that would have put you well into October by that time?  Yes.  Anything significant from your experiences there in Seoul that comes to  mind?  Yes, I had a very significant thing happen to me. I picked up a little  Korean whose parents had been killed. I kept him with me and kept him  supplied with food and all until we left two weeks later. His name was  Butchy. Butch. (Laughter) It broke my heart when I had to leave him.  He was only like eight years old. No parents. No one to take care of him.  Was there anyone you were able to leave him with?  13  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  I did. I left him with some Korean civilian workers. A month later at  Chosin Reservoir, I was up at Chosin at that time, and some of my  buddies were back at Hungnam, and guess who showed up? Butch. He  rode trains. He hitchhiked until he found my buddies. They told him that  I was up north, and he kind of disappeared after that. So whether he  went up north trying to find me or not, I never did find out.  Wow. So, when you arrived, initially, for the move forward to Chosin,  what was the initial plan heading up there?  What was what?  What was the initial plan heading up there?  At Chosin?  Yes.  It was to drive up to the Yalu and drive all the North Koreans. Of course,  at that time, we were still fighting North Koreans and not Chinese. They  didn   t enter until we got up to Hagaru and Yudam-ni.  So you   re traveling north, there. At what date do you remember that you  arrived at Chosin, initially? And you were with the Two-Seven at that  time, right?  Yes. I must have gotten up there   oh, I know when it was. Let me back  track just a little bit. It was Thanksgiving night when they called my  gun. We were still at Hungnam. They called us and told us to be ready to  go north the next morning. So, that would have been November 24 or  something like that. The trip up to Chosin, I went up by truck. It was not  that long of a trip. It was like seventy-five miles.  That was from Koto-ri to Hagaru?  No, Koto-ri to Hagaru is ten miles, but from Hungnam to Chosin was  seventy-five miles.  I see. I see. So the initial push up there to Chosin was to push the  Chinese back over the Yalu River.  No. The Chinese hadn   t entered the war, yet. We were still fighting  North Koreans. It was to drive the North Koreans out. When we got that  close to the Chinese, we were forty miles from Manchuria. That   s when  the Chinese came into the war.  14  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  So where was your first conflict, I guess, or where did you run into your  first resistance?  At Inchon.  At Inchon?  Yes. But at Chosin, it was November 27 when they hit us. The Chinese  hit us hard on November 27.  Can you talk a little bit about that? Just kind of detail what occurred on  the twenty-seventh of November?  Yes. (Laughs) Thousands of Chinese were trying   they had been  ordered to annihilate us to the man, the First Marine Division. They  knew it would be a terrible blow to the country and to morale if they  could annihilate the First Marine Division. So, they hit us pretty hard,  and we fought. Luckily, I was on one side of the perimeter. We   d set up  a perimeter. We had a machine gun, a listening post, machine gun,  listening post, all the way around where we were, the location we were  at. The Chinese hit us to the south of where I was. So, the initial attack  was not directed toward the area I was in. It was to come, but not that  night.  So that first night, how many of the North Koreans do you think you had  coming at you?  Oh, my goodness. Thousands. When we left, in fact   this is something  I   ll never forget. We were pulling out of Hagaru to go back south, and  there were Chinese dead laying on the road that had been smashed flat  by our tanks and traffic. It was a horrible, horrible sight.  That was after the battle when you were pulling back?  Of the first night.  Oh, after the first night.  Yes, the first night.  Did you sustain any injuries that first night?  No, I did not. I did not.  So after that first night, what was the plan after pulling back just a bit?  15  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Well, we stayed and fought for a few more days until we were ordered to  go back south to Hungnam. That   s when my major battle was, between  Hagaru and Koto-ri. No, between   yes, between Hagaru and Koto-ri.  The Chinese had everything. The only thing we had was the road to  come down, and they had everything else so they told us when we left  that we   d be running a gauntlet of enemy fire. That became very true.  So you dug in for three or four days, there, at Hagaru.  You couldn   t hardly dig in. It was frozen solid. But I was lucky, being  on machine guns, the engineers had blasted holes, dynamited holes for  us. So, I had a fairly decent place. We even had a little tent roof that  protected us from the wet weather.  So who was in your foxhole with you there, or that bombed out hole with  you?  Who was   ?  Who was in there with you?  Lloyd Lanam.  Lloyd Lanam, okay.  Dear, dear friend.  Was he an assistant gunner to you?  He was the gunner. I think we were the only two   we both grew up in  the Nazarene church. I think we were the only two Nazarenes in the  entire marine corps. (Laughter)  So he was the gunner. Were you working as the assistant gunner at the  time?  No, Johnny Murphy was the assistant gunner. I was an ammo carrier.  My MOS  Military Occupational Specialty  was machine guns, but I  was an ammo carrier.  I know with the mortar guys, that they have to keep the ammo separate  from their positions. Was that the case for your position, or were you  able to actually keep your ammo in your firing position?  Well, we had eight men on the crews at that time. Six ammo bearers and  two, the gunner and assistant gunner. So, we had like twelve cans of  16  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  ammunition. I think there is six hundred rounds in each can so we had  like sixteen to twenty cans of ammo readily available.  So when a battle engagement would occur, that would start at night,  correct?  Yes.  How would the battle kick off? I   ve read and I   ve heard that the Chinese  and North Koreans would play bugles     Bugles, yes.     bugles, horns and everything else, whistles.  Yes, see, with the Chinese language there is so many dialects that they  had to use bugles for them to understand the commands. Yes, they did.  But I don   t remember ever hearing the bugles. It was just plain attack.  So they would just kind of open up with tracer fire?  Yes, tracers, though, we took the tracers out because it gives your  position away very quickly. So, we were instructed to remove the tracers  from our ammo.  And it kind of heats up the barrel, too, right?  Oh, yes. That barrel burns up and you   re    (Laughs) I don   t know if     we never had to change the barrel, but yes, it will burn it up.  So the battle goes through for several days. Then you   re pulling back  to     Hungnam.  Hungnam. Well, actually, you   re initially heading from Hagaru to Koto-ri.  Koto-ri. Yes, which, we buried our dead. I was put on the detail to help  bury our dead, and there were hundreds. So, we   d pick up a body, they   d  just pile them up in a big ole pile, and we   d reach in and pull somebody  out and load him onto a stretcher. We   d lift the stretcher up to the end of  six-by, the truck, and just plop them on over. Then they took them out to  a burial site, which I never did see that, but I did help load the dead on it.  I see.  17  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  My first sergeant was in there, and my buddy Gene Holland was in  there. My first sergeant won the Navy Cross that night or the night  before.  They were in the trucks that were taken that day?  Yes. Three of my buddies, two or three of my buddies were on the road.  One of them got wounded and one dead, the other one, able-bodied.  They were trying to get across the road and the truck was burning and of  course, everything was lit up like day. Sergeant McClung was his name,  William McClung. He ran out and was pulling the guys to safety when  the Chinese killed him.  That was your first sergeant?  Yes. And he, like I say, won a Navy Cross that   funny it happened  probably within ten yards of where I was, and I didn   t know that until I  read about it in a book.  No kidding?  Yes.  That sort of happens, though, when you   re engaged in a situation like  that.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes, because all you know that   s going on is probably six  foot.  Yes, six foot in either direction. Six foot in front of you.  Interlocking fire and all, so.  So you said the primary place that you ran into significant battle, was  that Hell Fire Valley?  Hell Fire Valley was further south, which I went through the next two  days later. Terrible, terrible scene at Hell Fire Valley.  Can you tell us about that significant part of the retreat back, prior to  getting to Hell Fire Valley?  Hell Fire Valley took place when the relief column tried to fight into us  and the Chinese just slaughtered them. That   s Gacho, part of that group  that eventually made it in, but it was just dead everywhere. I saw a  18  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  marine under a truck and a dog and I thought,    I wonder what they   re  doing under there.    I started to walk over to them, and I realized they  were both frozen solid, just sitting there. I thought,    Boy        They were underneath a six-by?  Yes.  So, prior to getting to Hell Fire Valley, what kind of   you said there was  a significant battle or significant event.  It was just mainly sniper fire after that initial attack when they really laid  into us. It was ten miles. We probably had covered half of that so we had  like five miles to go to get to Koto-ri. There wasn   t a whole lot of action  at that point.  Anything stick out in your mind from that specific part of pulling back?  Of course, losing Gene Holland and my first sergeant. Other than that, I  can   t think of any significant facts, except seeing Chesty Puller for the  first time. (Laughs)  Where was that?  At Koto-ri. They were back   he was back at Koto-ri. As we pulled in  after fighting all night, Chesty was standing near there to welcome us or  whatever. (Laughs) First and only time I ever saw Puller.  For those who don   t know, who was he?  He was a marine legend. (Laughs) The men all, to this day, they look up  to Chesty. They say,    Goodnight, Chesty Puller,    in boot camp.  (Laughter)  Some of the other gentlemen I   ve talked to have talked about significant  things or the best of humanity and the worst of humanity     The what, I   m sorry.  The best of humanity and the worst of humanity in war, and that that can  be seen. Do you have anything that might come to mind for either one of  those, as far as the best of humanity, things you might have seen?  I   m sorry, I can   t     Just the best of humanity?  19  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Oh, the best of humanity.  Yes, during that time.  Yes. We had a catholic chaplain with us, and he was in a radio van. In  fact, I was standing next to the radio van when bullets started pinging  through it. I thought,    Gosh, what is that?    Anyhow, the chaplain was in  there and his assistant covered the chaplain with his own body and was  killed. So, that was one. I   ve often thought about it, I think,    Who won,  who lost?    We all lost. Nobody won anything. It was just a waste of  human life, as far as I   m concerned. I   m sure there were many acts of  bravery. Like I was saying, Sergeant McClung ran out on the road to  pull in my friends. I   m sure that was occurring all up and down that  road, probably.  How about probably the worst of humanity? I know I   ve heard some  stories that are just terrible.  Yes, worst of humanity     And the reason I ask, I think it   s important, for historical reasons, for  people to be able to see both sides and maybe have examples of both.  Yes. One thing happened. I was in a ditch with a wounded Chinese for  pretty much all of one night. He was wounded badly. When a truck  behind me was hit by mortar or grenade fire, it burst into flames. I had to  vacate that position pretty quickly because I could see bullets striking  the ground around me because I was not silhouetted, but I could be seen  by the enemy. Finally, I had to screw up all my courage and crawl over  this wounded Chinese. I made it, got to the other side of the road.  The next morning as we were preparing, picking up our dead and  wounded, the Chinese was still in the ditch. My lieutenant said,    Is that  man dead?    I said,    I don   t know, sir. Last night he was still alive.     About that time, the Chinese lifted his head and my lieutenant took out  his .45 and shot him. That may have been humane because the man was  badly wounded, was freezing, undoubtedly, to death. I   ve struggled with  that for many a year, thinking about that. Was that humane or  inhumane? In some respects, both, I guess. That happened as we were  going. Chinese, you could see their breath, the ones that were living,  especially at Hell Fire Valley. We were ordered to kill them. I was  ordered to kill a wounded Chinese. I couldn   t do it. The guy behind me  killed him. But there was a lot of inhumane, looking back on it now, but  what can you do? So, they were killed. I   m sure they did the same to us.  20  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  I   m sure. I   m sure. I   m sure that sort of thing still happens, even today.  Oh, yes. Sure.  Oh, yes. Sure, sure.  I was a very kind, gentle soul. Really, it really bothered me and hurt me.  Probably where a lot of my PTSD  post-traumatic stress disorder  came  from was seeing the inhumanity between people.  How many casualties did you have in your unit over the course of the   ?  Just in my unit?  Yes.  We had one killed and seven wounded, just in my little group.  How many were in your little group?  Just the machine gun squad.  For those people who don   t know, how many people would make up a  machine gun squad?  Usually six, but at that point, we had eight.  So one killed and how many wounded?  Let me think, probably three. Three wounded.  So roughly 50 percent.  Yes. Oh, yes, it was 50 percent. I should have said that because I knew  that. We lost 50 percent, and I didn   t get a scratch. I lived with  survivor   s guilt for a long time.  How do you deal with that?  They put me on medication. The VA, yes.  With the survivor   s guilt, what kind of outward effects?  Just complete   for example, I might be walking on a beautiful spring  day   I remember this happening   and just really enjoying it and all the  sudden, it was like a sledgehammer had hit me. I go into deep, deep  21  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  depression. Just thinking on a beautiful day, that all the carnage and  everything that I had seen, really would go into deep depression. I had a  bad habit of   I had like three books on Chosin. I would read them and  read them and re-read them like I couldn   t let go. So     So is sitting and talking with the guys from the group here in town, does  that   do you ever sit and chat about those things or   ?  No, we don   t. Chosin never comes up.  No kidding?  No. It   s strange. We just get together and just enjoy each other. Nobody  ever   I can   t remember anybody ever mentioning Chosin. Of course, we  have a prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, and then a prayer for our  departed comrades. Other than that, no. How are you going to talk to  another guy about,    Oh, let me tell you how cold it was.    (Laughter) He  knows how cold it was.  Exactly. So, as far as the survivor   s guilt and all of that, did you   of  course, you said you got some medications.  Yes.  Would you participate in any group kind of therapy or group talk?  I went to group therapy for a while with Vietnam veterans, mostly. I just  didn   t fit in so I dropped out. I don   t know why. I just felt like the odd  man.  Different generation or just different war?  Different war, different feelings toward the casualties of the war. I  couldn   t handle it so I dropped out.  Were you awarded any medals or citations for your service?  Yes. I   ve got like twelve medals, but one for valor. I hate to say that.  Sounds like   but I did receive a medal for valor.  Well, that   s okay.  It   s the lowest ranking medal for valor, Marine Corps Commendation  medal with V for valor.  What was that for, specifically?  22  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  It was for Chosin.  Just for the battle, itself, for being a participant in that battle.  Yes. Yes.  It wasn   t for a specific action during the battle.  No, no.  Okay. Let   s see here. Supplies, while you were there in Chosin, were you  ever at risk of not having supplies or running low on supplies or ammo?  Oh, my goodness, yes.  How was that?  Airdrops.  Okay and those airdrops would occur during the daytime?  During the daytime. A lot of them went over to the Chinese so they  probably got as much as we did. (Laughs)  It kind of served to prolong the battle a little bit, I guess.  Yes, but we were very short on ammunition. In fact, between Koto-ri  and Hagaru, we had run out. They got a tank through to us, just in the  nick of time, with ammo. There was no other way to resupply us, except  by a tank getting through to us.  Was there any kind of rule of thumb for ammo conservation?  No. Well, yes, there is. From boot camp, on, they tell you that when you  fire your weapon, there better be a dead man at the other end of it. We  didn   t just wantonly fire. It had to be specific targets and all, to conserve  ammunition. The two most terrifying words in the English language  occurred up there when we run out of ammo and our major, who was  called Fearless Freddy Simpson, yelled,    Fix bayonets     Now, that is  terrifying.  So you had to fix bayonets at one point in time?  Oh, yes. That   s when they got the tank through to us, though, just in the  nick of time.  23  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  So you didn   t have to engage in any hand-to-hand at that point in time?  No, thank goodness, because they outmanned us. We had like forty-seven  guys in my group. They probably had, I think, they estimated a  battalion and a half of Chinese hit us, the forty-seven of us.  So a battalion and a half. For those who wouldn   t know, how many  would that comprise?  In the marine corps, that would be fifteen hundred. I think the Chinese  were a little bit smaller than that.  Okay, so they probably had around two thousand?  Yes, probably.  To your forty-seven.  Yes.  Good grief. That wouldn   t have gone good if   hand-to-hand would have  been quite an exercise.  It would have been a horrible exercise. (Laughs)  So did you stay in the marines after the Battle of Chosin?  Oh, yes.  How long were you in the marines?  I had another year. Let   s see, that was February. Yes, I had a year to go.  They sent me back to Camp Pendleton.  So, everyone had marched out, the seventy-six miles back to the coast.  Right.  Were you in Korea a period of time before you went back to Pendleton?  Oh, yes, I had another year. I spent another year there.  Another year in Korea, after the Battle of Chosin?  After the battle, yes.  24  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Whereabouts?  Oh, gosh, Masan, Pusan, Chunchon, Chungju, just all over. I was  never   we were never just placed somewhere and stayed. We were  constantly out in the field and on the move.  Did you keep a diary during that time?  Do what?  Did you keep a diary or a journal during that time?  No, nothing.  Did you know of anyone that may have?  I   m sure there must have been, but I never remember anybody. I had a  little bible, New Testament. My daughter has it. It was all waterlogged  and it   s about that thick, now, when originally, it was about that thick.  (Gestures) (Laughs) But I think Sally has my Testament from that  period.  I was going to ask about letters from home during that time. Even  through the battle there at Chosin, did you have very many letters from  home? Were you writing letters to home at that time?  I didn   t write much. I   m not much of a writer. In fact, the Red Cross got  on me about writing my mom because I just never wrote. (Laughs) Yes,  they were pretty good about writing me. Mail is the only thing, I think,  keeps you really, your morale up to where you can go on. We had a girl  in my hometown that she wrote me pretty regularly. Not a girlfriend or  anything, just a girl that I had gone to school with.  How was that, getting letters from her?  It was good. I had one girl, though, wrote me, she said,    What would  you do if on some dark night, I snuck up and through my arms around  you?    I said,    I   d stick a bayonet in your gut.    Oh, hacked her off.  Really got her mad. (Laughter)  That was by letter that you said that?  Yes, I guess she thought we   d make mad passionate love or something.  (Laughter)  25  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  So after you ended your service, that would have been like 1952,  probably?  Fifty-two, I got out, yes. Forty-eight to 1952.  What did you do after the service?  I went back to the steel mills and worked there for just a couple months  and decided to go to college. So, I went to Southeastern Louisiana in  Hammond, Louisiana. Met my wife, married her and left school and  went back and went back to work.  Okay. Did you use the GI Bill at any time to go to school?  Yes, I did for a short period. In fact, it paid me more than I did as a PFC   Private First Class  in the marine corps. I made seventy-five dollars a  month in the marine corps, and I made a  117 going to school. So, it was  quite a step up for me. (Laughter)  So what was the highest rank you achieved?  Corporal.  Corporal?  Yes.  Okay. Did you join any veteran   s organizations, later on?  Just the Chosin Few.  Just the Chosin Few. Not the VFW  Veterans of Foreign Wars  or the  American Legion?  No, no.  Any reason why?  Again, it   s like that group of veterans that I dropped out of the group  therapy. I just had no desire to be around anyone. I became kind of  reclusive   not reclusive   but my life changed, pretty much, drastically.  Lost my girlfriend. I was very mean to her when I came home. I wasn   t  very kind to her, let   s put it that way. I guess, again, the survivor   s guilt  and all got to me. So, we broke up and wonderful, wonderful girl.  How do you think your experience at Chosin affected your civilian life  26  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  Myers  Sharp  from then going forward?  Oh, it   s affected it. There   s not a day goes by that I don   t think of it. Not  a day.  Good things and bad things, I   m sure.  Good things and bad things, because there were good things. There were  good things. Yes. So, I don   t dwell on the bad things, but they   re still  there.  Have you ever tried to figure out where Butchy might have gone to?  Where what?  Where Butchy might have ended up at?  Yes, we sure did. Me and my wife, we contacted missionaries in Japan  and tried to find Butch, but were unable to. So, I hope he made it.  When was that, when did you contact those missionaries?  Oh, in 1952, after I got out.  Okay. Nothing showed up?  No, nothing.  If you could jump in a time travel machine, would you do it again?  Oh, yes. If I could serve with the same guys that I served with, yes. I  sure would.  Why so? Tell me why.  Camaraderie. I was never closer to any group of people in my life than  the Chosin guys. My brother, he   s a former marine, also. I feel closer to  them than I do to my own brother, and I love him dearly.  I certainly understand that. Any words for anyone that might be reading  this or listening to this or watching this, about what it means to serve?  To me, it meant everything. I   m still proud of my service. I would do it  again, if need be. I love my country. I love my flag. It still gives me  flitters to see the flag flying. Just love your country and be ready to  defend it against any evil.  27  Myers  Sharp  Myers  I agree. I absolutely agree. I want to thank you for giving me the  opportunity to meet with you today and talk with you.  I hope I haven   t been too boring.  Oh, no, not a bit. (Laughs) It   s been a great experience for me so far,  and I certainly appreciate your time. Again, thank you for your time. I  appreciate it.  -------  -------
