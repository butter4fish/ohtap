 Finchum  Cleveland  Today is October 5, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project centered around Cooperative Extension. Today we   re in  Sulphur, Oklahoma, talking with Eldon Cleveland who began with  Extension in 1969 and retired in 1984. He   s an entomologist. Thank you  for coming today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood, where  you were born, about your parents and we   ll work our way forward.  I was born in Sulphur, Oklahoma   this is my home town   March 10,  1919 and that   s a long time ago. A lot of things have happened,  however, during that time. I was out of the states. I was in Europe and  Italy for three years in the army and then I came back and worked some  before I ever started to school. I began my schooling at Eastern New  Mexico University, in agriculture. After that, I went to Murray State   Oklahoma  and got an associate   s degree and from there I went to OSU,  Oklahoma State University, and received a bachelor   s degree. I waited  several years before I began my master   s program and I believe I got  that in 1972 or somewhere through there.  At first I was a grasshopper. I had several jobs. I took a job with a  chemical company with the states of Kansas and Missouri, selling  agricultural chemicals and from there I took a job with the Johnson  County Health Department; I was their sanitarian.  From there I taught school at Oklahoma School for the Deaf in upper   division  science. There   s a little story behind that. When I was working  in New Mexico, checking fields for a chemical company, I became  friends with a man by the name of Stanley Coppock from OSU and he  5  Finchum  Cleveland  said,    If I get back to Stillwater, would you come to work for me?    and I  said,    Try me.    I forgot all about it and one day, out of the blue, I got a  call right in the middle of class, in science, at Oklahoma School for the  Deaf. He said,    There   s going to be a plane load of men coming to  Sulphur and they want to interview you for a job.    And so they did,  landed at that airport out here and got a taxi and came to the Artesian  Motel at that time; they had a caf  . After the interview, they offered me  the job of Extension Entomologist, stationed at Cordell, Oklahoma and  primarily working with the cotton growers.  During that time I had the whole state checking the fields, giving  programs and helping the extension directors (back in those days we  called them the county agents) helping them with their growers and then  working with the housewives on their household problems and then with  the 4-H kids and the kids in the schools. So it was a wonderful place.  When I was working with the chemical company out of Houston, I met a  man there that says,    Cleveland, one of these days you   re going to find  something that you just can   t do without. Water will reach its own level  and you   ll know if you   ve hit the right spot.    Well, Extension was my  right spot. I loved Extension. I talked, I helped everybody with their  insect problems and the 4-H kids with their identification and collections  and things like that.  Back in those days, Extension, or colleges, were getting quite a bit of  money in the early    60s. So instead of having me run all over the state,  they set up complexes in different parts of the state. I was at Cordell,  they had one at Altus, Muskogee, McAllister and several others. So they  gave me twelve counties from Roger Mills to Murray County. I think  they gave me Murray County, really, because they knew that I lived  here. This is my home town. In those twelve counties, we had just about  everything grown in Oklahoma. Cotton, corn, sorghum, watermelons,  cantaloupes, peanuts; you name it, we had those crops. So those are the  ones that I helped the growers with and it was great. Can I tell a few  funny stories here?  Oh, sure   One I remember, we had a little mite we called winter grain mite that got  in the wheat during the early fall and winter. It had a brown body and  bright red legs, but it had a severe case of photo negative tropism, which  means that they were sensitive to light. In the day time, they fell down  on the ground, crawling around, and in the night, they would crawl back  up on the wheat and feed. There   s only two ways that you see how many  mites you had. First you could look at the field and instead of a bright  green, it was a dull grey color. So if you had that, you knew that you had  6  winter grain mites. Otherwise, you would go out there in the day and  count the mites crawling around on the ground and you had a little  square, one inch Japanese thread counter that you put down on the  ground and you counted the mites in that square inch. Then you   d get a  pretty good estimate of how many mites you had there in the field.  One day I was out in the field, lying on my stomach, looking through the  Japanese thread counter and I could feel someone at my side. I looked  up and there was a lady in a big black Oldsmobile that had seen me in  the field and just knew that there was a dead body out there. So she  drove out there and parked parallel and when she was getting out to  investigate, I raised up to find out what she wanted. You   ve never seen  such tracks that she made there in the field out towards Sayre,  Oklahoma. I   ve often wondered what she told the people there about the  person that she found in a wheat field and she was almost had in the  wheat field.  Things like that just happened over and over. I had several cases of  entomophobia. That is an inordinate fear of insects. And little pockets of  those, I cannot understand why, Sayre was one of them; Elk City was a  bad one, we had several there. We had one person that I presume he  heard so many advertisements about dust mites that he felt them  crawling on him and sprayed his entire house with very toxic, potent  material and had an open gas fire. We had several like that. We had a  woman in Sayre that her daughter   s boyfriend was coming to see her and  she had a fear that he was going to be molested with insects and she put  her bed on four gallons of kerosene on the bottom of her bed. And she  was a nurse, too. Clean as a whistle, she had no insects.  I had one that turned out to be real funny. A doctor in Elk City said,    I  have a real good pair of workers on my farm and they are going to quit  because the wife is being covered up with insects.    So I went out there  and she had an open window with a fan in the window and she sat in  front of that fan watching television. If you   ve ever seen thrips  Order  Thysanoptera , a good way to see if you   ve got thrips is go to your field  and peck on your onion leaves and watch   oh no, white piece of paper  or get a rose petal and they   ll come out of roses on a white sheet of  paper and you can see what thrips look like. Little-bitty small, almost  microscopic insects. One of their favorite foods is Four O   Clocks. She  had Four O   Clocks growing under her window. So the fan would pick  up the thrips and bring them right into the room with her and cover her  up with the thrips, that the fan had taken from the Four O   Clocks. Well,  she had several options. She could   ve moved her chair or shut the  window or cut down the Four O   Clocks, but we told her exactly what  was going on. So the doctor saved the couple on his farm, and that was a  real situation. She did have insects, but they weren   t bothering her, just  7  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  crawling on her.  Someday I said I   m going to write a book and tell about all the  experiences that I have had in Extension. One thing about Extension, it  was my water level. I helped everybody, including everybody around,  the housewives, the 4-H kids, the school kids, and especially the  farmers, with all their different crops and it was real interesting. I retired  in 1984 at the age of sixty-five and I could   ve gone on longer, but I  decided that that   s about the time to retire, so that   s why I retired. What I  was going to do after retirement, one of my favorite crops was alfalfa. I  loved alfalfa and they had so many new insects coming in and I was  moving back to Pauls Valley to start alfalfa field checking for the  growers. In the mean time, two organizations, the Oklahoma Agriculture  Aviation Association and the Oklahoma Agricultural Chemical  Association said,    Work for us.    So they talked me into forgetting the  alfalfa checking operation and I built an office in Pauls Valley and took  care of all of their business: setting up their annual meetings and  collecting their dues, writing their papers for them and that was real  good, real fine.  But that finally got a little bit tiresome and in the mean time my wife had  retired from teaching in Wynnewood. She taught her last four years in  Wynnewood and lived in Pauls Valley. We decided we wanted to go  into real estate, so I retired from those two jobs that I had and we took a  course in the school at Wayne and we both went into real estate, which  neither of us really liked, so eventually both of us retired, retired. It  hasn   t been slow since then because there   s something always coming  up. After retirement the ladies around would ask me to come talk to their  garden clubs, which was good, I loved it. But now, it   s just something  coming up all the time that keeps you busy and that   s about the size of  my Extension work.  Well let   s back up a little bit to when you were in grade school and high  school. Were you involved with 4-H?  No, we had no 4-H during my high school years or grade school years. I  graduated from Washington Grade School on the west side of Sulphur  and of course high school, the nearest thing we had was biology. I   d  taken that, but I didn   t decide to major in entomology until I got to OSU,  because in the mean time I wanted to be a bacteriologist, which I took at  Murray College. But after I got to OSU, I collected insects and made  insect collections and it was so interesting that I decided that that was  my major and I   ve never been sorry since.  And what year was that, when you went to Oklahoma A M?  8  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  1967.  So by then it was OSU. Did you have brothers and sisters?  I had three brothers and three sisters. One of my sisters, I hate to say it,  but she taught me in the fifth grade (laughs) in her classroom and then at  home, if I acted up during the class. All my sisters are dead now and two  of my brothers, so one brother and I are the only ones that are left.  Did you live on a farm at that time?  No, in town and my dad worked for the county and I guess the biggest  salary he had ever gotten was  75. Most of them was  50. With seven  kids, that didn   t go very far. We knew that the Depression of the    20s  was around.  So you were born in what year?  1919. March 10, 1919.  When did Extension even come up? It wasn   t in high school and you   re  parents didn   t work on a farm, you didn   t have interaction with a county  agent     It was all during Oklahoma State. Well, I had taken agricultural courses  at Murray and also agricultural courses at Eastern New Mexico  University; dairy, soils, things like that, chemistry. So I was pretty well  prepared to teach science at Oklahoma School for the Deaf (OSD) and I  loved that. I loved teaching at Oklahoma School for the Deaf. They gave  me everything to teach with and of course I had to use my signs, but  most of all it was the things that they gave me to teach with and I loved  it there. However, during that time, the OSD salaries were not good and  we had three in college at the same time, a boy and a girl, and Bernice  wanted to go back to school. When they came from Stillwater and  interviewed me and offered the job with Extension, the salary was about  three times as much. I went to my superintendent at the School for the  Deaf and explained to him. He said,    You get Bernice to teach for you  these last six weeks and I will give you permit to leave.    And he did, and  she didn   t like it. (Laughs) She had been running the bookstore at  Murray College during that time. She came to Sulphur and taught for me  and that   s when I came to Extension.  Well in those early days, describe a typical day. Like your first year on  the job.  At Extension? Okay, you bet. First was getting acquainted. My district  9  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  director was Bill Cooke. He was in Duncan and I visited with him and  he went over the entire situation with me and he was wonderful. Great  person, you could never find    He died three or four years ago in  Edmond. But in the meantime, I had so much experience with the whole  state that they wanted me to come to Stillwater and I would   ve loved it.  Because I would   ve gotten to teach and they were wanting me to go  ahead and get my master   s degree, which I finally did, but they said,     You come anyway, we   ll take you.    So we had our argument between  Bill Cooke and Newt Flora, who was in the entomology department at  OSU. Newt was determined to get me to come to Stillwater, so Bill  Cooke said,    I   m determined to keep him here.    (Laughs) Bill Cooke  won and it made Newt a little bit mad, but anyway, that   s where I  retired, when I was living in Cordell.  So how many counties?  Twelve.  Twelve total. And you, probably at some point, were in all seventy-seven?  Yes, oh yes.  So would you typically get up and hit the road by 7:30 and get home  by     Yes, late, late, late. Especially during the growing season. When I was  checking so many crops, watermelons here, peanuts here, sorghum here,  cotton here. Yes, it was morning until night and sometimes I would get  calls during the night saying,    Can you tell us where they   re going to  spray? We   ve got honeybees and we want to protect our honeybees.     That   d be sometimes in the middle of the night they   d call, which was  good, I could understand, but I sure would   ve like to have got a good  night   s sleep. Yes, I left early in the morning and sometimes got back  way at night, after checking the fields all day.  During that time, and why I have no earthly idea, I was overweight,  although I was working from daylight until dark. I was weighing 230  pounds and I developed diabetes and spent some time in the hospital at  Cordell. So, I   ve still got it. I   ve had it all this time and I   m on insulin.  One thing that did happen that I don   t know how or why, we had a  retired Extension director that built a beautiful, beautiful home down on  the Lake of the Arbuckles, overlooking all three arms of the Arbuckle.  His big problems were turkeys and deer eating his plants. I was at a  funeral in Pauls Valley and he said,    Would you come back by  10  Finchum  Cleveland  Wynnewood and get me a big jug of Round-Up?    I said,    I sure will.    I  came back by Wynnewood and got him a jug and me a jug.  My wife was having an ice cream party at the time so we were hurrying  around and Charlie Phelps, who was the Extension director that had  bought the beautiful home on the Arbuckle, his ceiling was thirty feet  high and his front room covered a wide expanse, but it had a little step  up on a ceramic floor in his dining room. So I was rushing and hung my  toe on that eight-inch rising and fell and broke my hip and just crushed  it. I shouldn   t have, because I should   ve been tougher than that, but it  did. So they took me to Oklahoma City and I had to have a hip  replacement and it worked real fine for a year and then I started to hurt  badly.  I finally got to where I couldn   t walk any and instead of going all the  way to Edmond to the bone hospital where I had my first operation, I  chose to go to Ardmore to the Bone and Joint Hospital. The doctor there  took out everything. He took out the old prosthesis and left me without  anything. I laid on my back for two and a half months or actually three  months there, in a swing bed, in Sulphur in the hospital. During that  time, I lost all my equilibrium. I have no balance whatsoever. This is  why I   m on a wheel. I   m still there and I went back to my original  doctor about three weeks ago and he said,    I can   t do anything for you.     He said,    I   ll send you to a neurologist,    and I thought, no way. This is  why I   m on a wheel.  Well when you were working what were a couple of the craziest  questions that you   d get asked?  (Laughs) Oh, you   d be surprised. I think they used me as    you   re too  young for that, but there was a lady that used to write in the paper by the  name of Dorothy Dix; she answered everybody   s questions. It didn   t  matter what the question was, but she asked me. It might not have  pertained to insects, but they would recount the things that had happened  in that area, like someone killing the person over by Burns Flat during  the 1937 snowstorm in April. April the eighth was the biggest  snowstorm that they ever had during that period and I worked for the  lady over there that had cattle and wheat and alfalfa. She had pictures of  the snow piling up inside of her barn and the cattle trying to escape from  the snow drift and push the sheet iron off the top of the barn. The snow  was that deep. People like that would ask questions and there would be  one old boy that said,    Do you remember that time when the guy  knocked a guy in the head with a hammer and killed him out near Burns  Flat?    Yeah.    Do you know where he threw the hammer? Right behind  the bowling alley in Cordell and after the snow melted they went out  there and found the hammer.    Things like that, people were re-counting.  11  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Well what were some of the tools of your trade? Did you carry things  with you?  Well, I always have two  inaudible . One, a net to catch my flying  insects and another one made out of canvas that you could sweep the  fields. Then you bring them in and look to see what you had. If they  were good insects, bad insects, how many and then we would send the  report to Stillwater. They would consolidate them and send out a report  to everybody that needed to have the report. We made sure they got the  report on everything that we picked up during a month   s time. Arnold  was his name, who consolidated things back in Stillwater at that time.  Everybody knew exactly where the insects were, what the condition  was, how many good insects were around, whether we recommended  that they spray or not and things like that. They could get that from the  reports that we sent.  Good insects?  Oh, you bet. We   d rely on good insects. Of course, some of them were  good, bad, or indifferent. Out of all the insects, back in 1940, they had  classified and named two million different species of insects, and that   s  a lot. In the meantime, they said that they   ve got about nineteen million  more in the rainforest and places like that that they hadn   t classified.  There was a guy by the name of Linnaeus that originated the original  nomenclature, the genus, and the specie. A lot of the insects, we could  know their scientific name, like the Spotted Cucumber Beetle     Diabrotica undecimpunctata. Things like that, we could remember.  We had to memorize the weeds that they fed on. We have one weed in  Oklahoma that, from the state of Washington to Oklahoma, it   s called by  seven different names. If you know the scientific name, it doesn   t make  a difference where you are; whether you   re in England, Russia, Japan,  you know that you   re talking about the goathead. You   re not familiar  with goathead. You know why? Because back in 1970s we imported two  little insects that fed on the goatheads. One of them fed on the plant  itself and one fed on the seed. In a year   s time, I had to go around  checking to see if these little insects were there, feeding on the  goatheads. You   d be surprised how many goatheads we had back in  those days. I played football at Sulphur where we have the Sooner Foods  down here, that whole field was goatheads. Pretty green, but you had  goathead on your shoulders, knees, legs, you know, where they   d break  off, you   d fall on them. Those insects just almost took the goatheads  completely out of the picture. So now you never see a goathead around  here. Every once in a while I hear someone say,    I saw some up in the  Panhandle.    And maybe they did, but I haven   t seen one in a long time.  12  Finchum  Cleveland  So good insects, you bet. We have good and bad. We have about seven  different species of blister beetles in Oklahoma. The blister beetle puts  out a material called cantharidin. It   s a material that if you get it on your  skin, it penetrates your skin, goes into your stomach, kidneys and causes  irreversible damage. But the larvae of blister beetles are good because  they feed on grasshopper eggs. So there is a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde insect.  But when they come out in swarms, like the striped blister beetle, in  alfalfa fields and the mower goes through and the baler bales them in a  bale of hay and the horses eat the hay, they   ll ingest the blister beetle,  the cantharidin chemical, so things like that you have to watch carefully.  Now cantharidin, right after World War II, we had a company that put  out a hair tonic called   I forgot what it was called, in fact I   ve been  trying to find the label, and I had one one time but I let it get away from  me. But in the active ingredients was extracts of cantharides, which was  cantharidin. And to get the cantharidin, you still use it a little bit now,  not very often, but the veterinarians use it to feed to obstinate mares. It  gets in their kidneys and they   ve got to do something so they breed.  They get the real rich cantharidin from a big black blister beetle from  Spain. They get it here, extracts of cantharides, so this label on the hair  tonic contained extracts of cantharides, so back in those days you were  putting blister beetle juice on your hair. (Laughs) You don   t see that  anymore and I   m glad, but that was the material your grandmother, not  your grandmother, your great-grandmother used to say,    Don   t go to that  party, those mean boys will put this in your Kool-Aid or juice.     Damaging. Real damaging. So that   s why you want to kill people that  did that. It was called Spanish fly, you may have heard the word Spanish  fly, well that   s extracts of cantharides. So we   ve got things like that.  What was another one? Oh, the women in Mexico used to take camel   s  hair brushes and brush the little bitty mites off the prickly pears. They   re  little aphid-type insects. Their bodies would be boiled in water and  would turn brilliant red. They used that in everything back in those days.  We used it in our strawberry soda pop, our cough drops, you know red  cough drops? Cake coloring, lipstick, rouge, you were putting the insects  on your face. But now, the dyes have become so cheap that they   re  almost out of the picture. Maybe once in a while you will find a cough  drop with the red material in there from the  inaudible  tribe. It ate  insects off of prickly pears.  So you read labels.  (Laughs) Yes. But it was interesting. You just can   t imagine anything so  interesting as one field to the next. I   ve had women pick me up and take  me to their watermelon fields up near Roger Mills County because they  had an insect feeding on the underside of their watermelons. We   d go  13  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  out there and have great big beautiful watermelons. I had one woman  take right across the field and you could hear the watermelons squish  right under the wheels, and it sure did hurt because I love watermelons.  You get something like that all the time, or you did get something,  which would make it interesting, really interesting.  You had to have an excellent memory to remember what they look like  and what they did     Yes, you did. One insect, like the cotton bollworm, which we called the  corn earworm, you   ll find it in the ears of your corn or maybe you   ll get  them from the grocery store. In Florida, it feeds on sixty different crops.  So, just because you call it a cotton bollworm or corn earworm doesn   t  mean they aren   t on other crops. In fact, we had one over west of Davis.  Two brothers, their dad was on the board of directors at Oklahoma State,  they decided they were going into the vetch business. They planted a  beautiful field of vetch and a corn earworm got into their vetch and just  completely wiped them out. So you never really know what to expect  from insects.  Do they just show up?  Well, it   s a white moth, you see. A white moth will come in and lay their  eggs all over the field, the eggs will hatch and that   s what you call a  complete cycle: egg, larva, pupa, adult. Some of them are incomplete  cycles, which is a grasshopper: egg, nymph, adult. And many like that.  The eggs will hatch in the field and the larva will just wipe them out.  They   ll go through about five or six instars, which means shed their skin  and go to the next development period, finally end up as pupae, and then  as adult moths again, ready to do their work.  You tried to fight them with natural things instead of chemicals?  We   d love it if we could find lady beetles or a little bitty insect that feeds  on eggs. You   d love to see and the green lacewing fly that, you   ll see  them if you ever have a garden, you   ll see green lacewings a little bit  earlier than this. They   re in there laying eggs, the larvae are little  alligator-type insects with real strong mandibles and they feed on soft  insects, and they   re good. You love to see them. In fact, ninety-seven  percent of all the insect populations are either good or indifferent. Only  about three percent will ever do you any harm. Now that three percent  you   ve got to watch.  And Oklahoma has its share?  It really has its share.  14  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Someone the other day mentioned armyworms?  Okay, the full armyworms. That   s another moth that lay their eggs in the  wheat fields this time of the year. They go through marching and that   s  kind of the peculiar thing there because we had real severe infestations  of full armyworms and another larvae, another armyworm larvae, will  feed on those. So if you have plenty of this type, yellow stripe  armyworms, feeding on the full armyworm, wait awhile, see if they     So things like that, you   ve got to watch. You don   t want to use  chemicals unless you just have to.  So you were green before green was cool?  Right  Right.  Well did you use your magnifying glass when you were out in the field?  You bet. You bet. Well of course you had several different types, but my  favorite was the old Japanese thread counter which was the square inch,  10 x power. You just put it down and count anything you   ve got, dirt, in  that square inch and then you can figure out just about what you   ve got  in the field. Now that doesn   t mean on the plant itself because you   ve  got to look for those. You   ve got to look for your boll weevil, your  bollworm, feeding on the bolls and if you   ve got enough to do you  damage, you can   t hesitate, you   ve got to spray. But in the meantime,  you will have killed all your good insects, so you have to start all over  again.  Was there ever a time when you couldn   t help them? There wasn   t an  answer?  Oh, let   s see. You had an answer. You gave them some kind. When I left  the sales business, I started to work for Texas Tech College. We called  ourselves the Green Bug Research Program through Texas Tech. After  World War II, the government deeded Texas Tech 15,000 acres of the  old Pan-Tech Ordinance. In that area, we had about seven different  projects going; boll progeny, urinary calculi, wheat poisoning, our small  grain insects, and three or four more. We were the first to use parathion.  We had one old boy who lived on an airplane, going to Germany and  back, dealing with the Bayer Company. They were the ones that were  manufacturing the first parathion, which was a nerve poison. So he  brought all of his samples to us in Panhandle, we were at Pan-Tech  farms. We lived in the old officer   s barracks there that were built to last  for maybe twenty years, but they were there twenty-five to thirty, so you  can see what the kind of conditions were. So he brought it to us and we  tested the parathion on insects, especially green bugs. I   ve been awfully,  15  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  awfully sick with parathion because it   s a nerve poison and pretty  potent. You go by a milligram per kilogram of your body weight. They  test it on the animals first and then take that data and see how that would  react to a human being and eventually maybe test it on humans. But  anyway, I   ve been awfully sick with parathion, really sick.  You said how unusual things happen, I had one guy over between  Anadarko and Cordell or Pauls Valley that wanted me to come and  check his cotton. Right after he called me to check his cotton, he called  the aerial applicator. And there I was, right in the middle of that cotton  field and he sprayed me thoroughly with two real toxic materials: endrin  and parathion. I was waiting, I was going to Anadarko to help judge a  fair and didn   t have time to go change clothes; I got sick. So, you never  know what   s going to happen.  That   s pretty bad.  It was.  And no notice that you were in the middle of the field.  No.  And you helped with county fairs?  Yes, I judged their insect collections and also their crops; helped the  Extension director with his crop selections.  From county to county or one county in particular?  Several.  Whoever asked.  Anadarko was one I always helped with.  Fairs, they don   t seem to be as many or as big     No, they don   t. I don   t think there   s an insect collection in our fair here  in Sulphur this year. I didn   t see it.  Well grasshoppers have been a big deal off and on through the years,  too haven   t they?  16  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Yes. I have seen hoards and hoards of grasshoppers flying through the  air and land in a sorghum field and then you hear them eating. Back in  those days, we had some good materials. We had endrin, parathion, we  had dieldrin.Two ounces of dieldrin per acre would just wipe out  grasshoppers. In fact, they   re cannibalistic. We   d kill one grasshopper  and another grasshopper would eat it and then it would die. So we had  wonderful materials back in those days. We don   t have those now.  Because it   s not safe?  It   s just too long residual. And toxic. But two ounces per acre is not very  much.  Was there a part of the job you didn   t like?  Being called at night.  (Laughter) And I   m assuming you had to do lots of reports, too?  Yes, lots of reports.  And being sprayed in the middle of the field I guess, too. Favorite parts?  Well, of course I would have to say my favorite part was helping the  growers with their insect problems and their commodities. Peanuts,  alfalfa, cotton, corn, watermelons, trees, anything like that.  Would you take a few home with you when you left?  Not if I could help it..  No, watermelons, though, when you were out?  (Laughter) Oh, yes. In fact, let   s see, that was when I was working for  Stauffer Chemical Company out of Houston. I had six states and half of  old Mexico and that   s a thing right there that I will never forget. They  wouldn   t even let me carry a briefcase. I   d have to fly to Harlingen or  McAllen or one of those places and get with one of our men that was  stationed in Mexico and go with him to go to the beach area and Saltillo  and places like that without a briefcase. If they were to see me with a  briefcase they   d try to arrest me because they wanted their men    That   s  a funny thing, I talked to a Cory Coffee Company representative that had  been there one year and had never gotten a permit to sell coffee. On that  same day, we were there looking to Saddle Back Mountain Golf Course  and a professional flew in and they gave him a permit the first day. So,  that   s Mexico. But things like that, too.  17  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  I was going to tell you, one man in Granite, Oklahoma took out a tree  row they used back in those days, they planted tree rows for protection  from the wind and the sand. Down that tree row, complete quarter of a  mile, he planted watermelons. He said,    You bring your pickup and you  get all the watermelons you want, one, two or a pickup load.    So I was  looking forward to that. I didn   t get one watermelon. You   d be surprised  what got them: coyotes. Coyotes love watermelon. They   d smell one  that was halfway ripe and then chew into it and the coyotes were thick in  that area. One place over across the river in Texas; I went with a man to  check his cotton and he had two   this may sound farfetched   but he  had two washtubs in his watermelon field and you could walk up to  them and hear scratching. We said,    What in the world do you have in  your washtubs?    He said,    Terrapins.    You know box turtles? And they  scratch, they never stop, trying to get out and the coyotes will hear them  and won   t come near that watermelon.  And it works?  It works.  Well its better I guess than killing the coyotes. Animals are not quite  your area of specialty.  (Laughs) No.  You pass it on to someone else to deal with them. Well how did you keep  up with the new bugs and things that were coming out? How often did  you have to refresh?  We had a bunch of them coming out in alfalfa. Spotted alfalfa aphid and  two or three other different species of aphids that were coming in to feed  on alfalfa. You always knew when something new was in the field and  then from there on the population grew and the damage grew, so you  had to be right on top of it.  You had to keep up with your research, too. Did you do radio shows or  write newspaper articles?  Yes, sure did. In fact, Southwestern at Weatherford had us come over a  lot of times and give programs. Then when I was with Texas Tech, there  was a guy by the name of Cotton John that had his agricultural program  and he had us on every week to tell the people what we found. Checking  green bugs and if you had any other insects besides green bugs and what  was working, what was not. So, we enjoyed that.  You   d have to describe them in detail so they   d know what to look for?  18  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Yes.  Well let   s back up a little. Since you mentioned your wife earlier, how  did you meet her?  Oh, this is a story I tell. Yesterday we had a funeral of one of my second  cousins and they were telling about their family. One of them said he  had a daughter at East Central. She finished East Central this year and  then was going somewhere to work and I said,    Tell her to be careful  because sixty-four years ago, I got into real trouble at East Central.     They said,    What?       I met my wife there.    (Laughs) So we   ve been  married over sixty-four years. Our sixty-fourth was about three weeks  ago.  Well congratulations   Thank you.  She didn   t mind being a Cooperative Extension wife all these years?  No, she enjoyed it. A lot of times I   d take her with me and she   d check  fields with me.  She learned about bugs too, huh? She knew a little bit about insects?  Yes, she sure did. In fact, she recalls the scientific names of insects now  that I   ve forgotten. (Laughs)  And you have two children?  Two children, a boy that just retired from   he was principal at Duncan  High School and his wife worked for several different oil companies that  had been first Phillips and then on and on and on. She stayed with all of  them. They decided that they wanted her in Tulsa so, they offered her  such a good job that he decided to go with her. So they moved to Pryor,  Oklahoma and he got a job. He retired this last year from teaching. Now,  he   s a good artist   a real good artist. We   re going to meet him, get some  of his pictures to show in a show here in Sulphur here in the next month.  He   s getting better all the time, but he really has never had a lesson.  She   s a good artist; she taught art and English.  Then we have a daughter in Muskogee and her husband is a medical  doctor and she is a registered nurse, graduated from Oklahoma Baptist  University School of Nursing. But she didn   t nurse very long, except her  family. She had four kids and so that kept her busy. They have a big  cabin in Creede, Colorado. It   s a little bitty cabin   five bedrooms. So  19  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  you can see. In fact, they just got back from fishing in Creede and they  love it up there. I can do without Colorado   s cold weather.  When you do travel do you look for insects?  You bet. You betcha.  Really?  You betcha. In fact that   s kind of a funny situation. In our church, we  have what we call a say-so bunch, which is the senior adults in Sulphur,  Oklahoma. We go every place. In fact we   ve got a choir. We go to  nursing homes and hospitals and sing. We used to sing pretty good, but  anyway, we were on a field trip down in the hill country in Texas and  we were all on Lyndon Johnson   s ranch. They hire people to take care of  the visitors and make sure that nothing happens to the property. So we  met two of our friends from Cordell that were doing work there during  the summer. But anyway, I was going to tell you that they had a tree out  in front that had something on it; I don   t know what it was. I didn   t  know if it was a disease or insects. So I reach out to touch it and I   ve  never heard such screaming,    Don   t touch that leaf     So, yes I look for  insects. (Laughter)  Did someone tell them you knew what you were doing?  I don   t think they knew. They just didn   t want you to touch anything.  Well does Extension have someone that does the same thing you did,  now?  You know, they don   t do that. In fact, the area complexes are out of the  picture. We used to have a complex. We   d have the county personnel.  The Extension director, the home economists, 4-H, and then they   d have  the specialists. The farm specialist, the entomologist, agronomist, and  now they   re not there anymore. I guess the money situation is    But it  was a good thing back in those days. We could cover our twelve  counties and do the job and loved it. What they have now    I don   t think  they have anybody checking fields.  So you still get phone calls then?  Sometimes. Sometimes. You betcha.  Do you recall some of the home demonstration women that worked with  you?  20  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  You bet.  Was it Cleo Stiles Bryan that worked down in this area for a little while?  Does that name ring any bells?  No.  I may have the wrong county.  Virginia Walker was our home economist. She was a good one. You  can   t beat Virginia. In fact, our son is a cowboy and we have two sides  to our family. I   m a Cleveland and a Runyon. The Runyon family are all  cowboys. So he took after the Runyons. He has eight horses, two little  horses, one mule, and four dogs. In the spring time, at the Cowboy Hall  of Fame, they have a whole day of original cooking and you have to  wear the original clothing and everything and Virginia   s worked with  our son up there.  Chuck wagons or something like that?  Yes, right. Open pits.  Were you involved with the national organizations or state organizations  in some capacity?  Well, of course I was back in those days originally because I covered the  whole state helping Extension directors in every county. If they want a  program in Guymon or a program in Hugo, I would go there and give  their programs. They would call; a lot of them would have me every  year. Anadarko, Duncan    Sometimes you were with the Extension long  enough that people knew you and when they wanted someone they   d  call on you. So I got into problems, like in Altus they hired a man to take  over that complex, an entomologist, but when they wanted a program,  they called me. I didn   t want to, I wanted to give it to him because he   s  the entomologist down here, but the Extension director wouldn   t hear to  it. Things like that you get into that you wish you didn   t.  The politics of it all.  Yes.  Well are there a couple of highlights, any moments that stick out?  Well, other than helping the growers with their problems, the peanut  growers, I loved working with the peanut growers. They had their own  problems, big problems. And alfalfa growers, I loved alfalfa, and other  21  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  commodities, too, and corn and cotton and sorghum. Highlights? All of  them were highlights.  Did any of your 4-H children or anyone you met along the way take up  your profession?  Sure did. In fact, we had one boy and a girl out of Pauls Valley that went  into entomology. I   ve forgotten their names, but he ran the feed store  there in Pauls Valley and both his boy and daughter went into  entomology and it just tickled me to death. I like to hear things like that.  Other than that, not too many, no. Not a great deal. I guess it   s too much  work.  (Laughter) Rolling around in the dirt and getting sprayed and     But you love it. You love it. You love to get out there on your hands and  knees to see what you   ve got. And you can   t know what you   ve got  unless you get on your hands and knees out in the middle of the fields.  Well in the early days, were you concerned about sunscreen and that  type of thing?  Not really. Of course, back in those days, sunburn? I think that was too  early really for advertising sunscreens.  Did you wear a hat?  Yes. Well, caps. Your ears got sun burnt though, I guarantee it. But you  got over it. I   ll say again, I   ve had a lot of different types of jobs.  Selling, testing proprietary products from Tennessee to Arizona, half of  Mexico, and loved that too, but 60,000 miles a year I traveled. So that  got tiresome. There   s something a little bit wrong with a lot of the jobs I  had. Like teaching at the deaf school, I loved it, but the salary was poor.  Put all of them together, no job that I   ve ever had was like Extension. It  was the water level that I had.  It must have been a hard decision to decide to retire then.  Yes, it was. It really was.  That would have been in the    80s?     84. I was sixty-five at that time, so it was time. But my wife came to  Wynnewood and taught the last four years there.  Well along that line, did you have a particular philosophy that you  22  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  Finchum  Cleveland  followed?  Well, other than doing your very best with what God has given you and  the opportunities that he has given you. Yes, that   s the main philosophy.  Do your very best and try your very best. Give them an answer.  It sounds like the state was lucky to have you for those years.  I appreciate it.  The last question I usually ask people is how would they want to be  remembered? When history is written about you    he was the best bug  guy ever?  (Laughs) Our Extension director at Cordell, he was a real nice guy, Bud  Barnes. He developed something, I don   t know what it was, but they had  to put him in the Veteran   s Center at Clinton and he couldn   t get out of  bed. He died about a month and a half ago. His wife wrote me a letter  saying that he   d always said that I was the best.  I   ve had a couple people tell me that too, before I came to see you.  That   s all of my questions. I appreciate you sharing your stories today.  You   re welcome.  And I   m glad I got to meet you.  I   m glad to meet you.  And I learned a few things about insects.  (Laughs) Well, there   s so many insects that you   ll never know all of  them, I guarantee.  And the good ol    honey bee is one of them. Okay, well thank you very  much.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
