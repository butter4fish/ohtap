 Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Today is Saturday, July 16, 2011. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. I   m  at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art today, interviewing Melvin  Swinhart, who will be talking to us about his memories of the 1930s.   We are also joined by Chris Powell.  Thank you for joining us today,  Melvin.  I   m glad to be here.  Well, I   d like to begin by having you tell me a little bit about your early  life. Could you tell us what year and where you were born?  I was born on January 17, 1919.  And where at?  Calvin, Oklahoma. Capital of the world. (Laughter)  What did your parents do for a living?  Well, my parents did mostly on a farm. They would rent the farm out to  some person that wanted a certain crop grown. That was called  sharecropping. My dad would get so much of the proceeds from the  crops. That   s what we lived on.  So, growing up as a little boy, did you have chores on the farm?  I had chores. I did.  What did you have to do?  Take care of the horses, feed them, get the bridles off of them, harness,  5  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  and all that stuff. My dad, he did most of that. When I   d get ahead of  him a little bit he   d say,    Now, you   re showing signs of intelligence     I  often wondered about that statement. (Laughs)  What else would you do, outside of the horses?  Well, on the farm I helped harvest the crops when they came in. He says,     Now, count the number of stalks of corn. Every third one is what we  get, every third stalk.    Cotton is the same way, every third stalk of  cotton, you get it. Let   s see, what else did we raise? Cotton, potatoes,  yes, every third hill of potatoes, we got. Hell, we lived off of that  What  the farm put out.  Would you have livestock?  Yes, we had one milk cow and two horses or two mules, either one. It  was times when you just used mules. Dad, he liked to run the mules  because he could control them. He couldn   t control the horses as good as  he could the mules. (Laughs) But anyhow, we made out pretty good with  all of it.  Would you have chickens or hogs?  Yes, Mom raised the chickens and she would butcher the chickens.  She   d take care of them. We   d have chicken nearly every Sunday  morning or noon.  You could always look forward to that.  Yes. (Laughs)  Well, what were some of the other foods you ate at home growing up?  What other things did we raise on the farm?  That you ate, that your mom cooked for you.  Let   s see now.  You   d have a vegetable garden. What else came out of the vegetable  garden?  What kind of vegetables did we raise? Okay. Corn, cotton, potatoes, and  okra, and beans.  That   s good stuff.  6  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Yes, pretty good stuff.  Well, what was it like going to school? Would you go to a country  school?  Yes.  What was the name of your country school?  Calvin School.  How far away was it from your home?  Oh, let   s see. It must   ve been about   well, we rode the bus. It was about  a mile and a half, I   d say.  Did the bus ever get stuck?  Oh, sometimes it was late. Sometimes it never did even run. (Laughs)  But most of the time it did. It showed up at the proper time. We got on  the bus and went to school.  Now, you and your brother were in the same grade, right?  Yes, and that   s a coincidence, too. I had to wait. I was eight years old  when I got to go to school first. He was six. So, the purpose of that was  to have one set of schoolbooks for both of us. We had pretty good  thinking then.  So, who was the better student, you or your brother? Who did better in  school?  Did you get better grades or did Orrin get better grades?  Oh  I guess we were just about   scholastically   about even.  Did you have a favorite subject? Did you like math? Did you like  reading? Science?  I liked history.  When you came home from school, did you have more chores to do?  Oh, I don   t know. I don   t think so.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Okay.  I didn   t think I had anymore chores to do.  Well, what would you do for fun, growing up?  For fun? About the most popular thing I got into, what I enjoyed doing,  singing in the men   s quartet.  Really?  Sang high tenor.  Can you still sing?  I do.  Why don   t you sing a little bit for me?  Oh  (Laughter)  A few bars.  Oh, I usually have company when I sing. (Laughs) A lady comes down  to our room and gives us   she plays a piano and we all sing while she  plays.  How young were you when you started singing?  Well, let   s see. I must   ve been around twenty-one or two, something like  that.  No, you started the Calvin Quartet in high school, right?  Well, that was when they organized the quartet. Before that, I sang with  singing groups all over the county of Hughes County.  Did you enjoy that?  I did. I really did. I had fun getting with a bunch of kids that I knew, and  we were just singing songs. (Laughs)  You sang on the radio some, right?  Yes, I was on the radio some, KRLD, Dallas, and KADA, Ada, we did  that for four years, singing Ada. It had a Sunday evening service just for  8  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  us on Sunday evening for a long time, I guess a month or more.  How far away is Ada from Calvin?  Thirty-one miles. The boy that sang the lead part, he had a car and he   d  come by and pick me up. He   d pick up my other members of the quartet  and then we   d go down there, and hop in and start singing. Farther along  we   ll understand it, oh, bye and bye.  Live on the radio   Yes.  It   s different when it   s live, right?  Yes, it really is.  How many songs would you sing on the radio every weekend?  During the week we sang somewhere in the neighborhood of five, daily.  It was only one day a week. It was our day. We sang about five songs.  Would you practice much?  Yes, we   d practice in the homes. We had an old piano at home and half  the keys, tops were gone off of it and all that stuff. (Laughs) It played,  though.  Can you play piano?  No.  Just sing.  Guitar. I tell you what, there was another quartet singing, and they did  fine. But this boy that I got the guitar off of, he played jazz with his  brother on TV.  Their names were Bob and J.D. Bennett.  I   ve got a  copy of them playing jazz at home. I was playing that one morning and I  was sitting there getting ready to go, when he walked by. A girl from  Hefner with maroon hair picks up my trash and everything else. My feet  are straight from the ground. She says,    Where in the world did you get  all that?    I said,    Well, my two brother-in-laws played guitars exactly  alike.       Well, that   s nice.    Boy, they liked that jazz music. (Laughs)  Who taught you how to play guitar?  9  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  I guess I was more or less self-taught. I picked up a guitar and started     my singing group bought a guitar after I got in with them. I learned quite  a bit on that, then.  Well, your very first singing group, was that back in high school?  I was in high school, yes.  How did you decide who was going to be in the first group?  Oh, that was already decided when they picked you out. (Laughs)  Who were the other members of that first group? Were they friends of  yours?  Who else was in the Calvin Quartet?  There were three others besides me, four, four of us. That   s why they  called it quartet, because there were four people in it: bass singer, a lead  singer, second tenor, first tenor.  What were their names?  What were their names? All right, let   s see. Lowell Wilkerson, he  happened to be a distant kin of mine.  He was second tenor.  And then  there was J.R. Fields,  baritone,  and his dad worked at the grocery store,  downtown. And me, of course, I sang first tenor. Then  there was Clyde  Cain who sang bass.   Who was your piano player?  Edith Caldwell was her first name. Then she got married and it   s  Edith    I don   t remember what her last name was. I   ll think of it here.  That first Calvin Quartet, would you play for school functions, like  dances? That first quartet, where would you sing?  Sing in church.  In church.  Country churches and my own church. We sang in schools and did  pretty good. A lot of times a group would be meeting somewhere, and  they   d just say,    Well, let   s have the Calvin Quartet come in here and  sing a song for us.    We   d hold a meeting when we   d have a little spare  time. We   d go in there and get to eat good  I think I gained a little bit of  10  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  weight while I was there.  Well, tell me about the town of Calvin. What did Calvin have in its  heyday? Did it have a movie theater?  Oh  You want to know what stores were prominent?  Yes.  J.W. Hundley Company was the main store and they sold everything  from ladies pants on down. (Laughs) And then George Morris was a  grocery man, only. Then two brothers were in on another store    Boy,  it   s taxing me. I can   t remember their name. Anyhow, they owned  another store. They called themselves the,    Jot    em Down Store.     (Laughs) They   d take a pencil and write down exactly what the ladies  wanted. A lot of times, they wouldn   t get exactly what   they   d  substitute because they didn   t have it in the stores. That was when the  fur flies, so to speak. He didn   t have business because he didn   t have the  right kind of stuff, but it was fun all the way through high school, grade  school and high school. I worked at Douglas, Long Beach, California for  a long time. Then I came back to Oklahoma and got in with the same  thing, Douglas in Oklahoma City.  When you went out to California, was that part of the war effort?  Yes, I learned to build airplanes when I was in high school.  How   d you learn that?  I went to   what   s the name of that school? Oh, it was Western Aircraft  Engineers. So, we went to that school and I learned to work   hard work  on planes. They   d put me to   riveting was a little loose, about that big  around, about that long. (Gestures) Pretty good work, got good pay.  Going to California, was that the first time you were out of Oklahoma?  That was in Oklahoma City. Then when I got to California, then I got in  with Douglas Aircraft. They put me right to work when I got there. That  was very hard to do for a person to come in out of Oklahoma, get a job  in a big place at Douglas Aircraft. They owned it, Californians do, local  people they called it.  Did they give you any grief because you were from Oklahoma?  I told them I was from Oklahoma and they said,    Oh, my goodness  It  looks like all of Oklahoma is coming in here for jobs     I said,    Well, I   m  11  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  one of them.    (Laughs) I said,    Take me or leave me.     During that time did your parents continue to have the farm?  My parents passed away when I was just a young man. Let   s see    I  don   t remember.  Well, it was after you were back in Oklahoma, after the war and  everything.  Yes. Chris knows more about me than I do. (Laughter)  Why don   t you tell about your mother getting the Maytag washing  machine?  Oh  There was a salesman that came by and he had a Maytag washing  machine, one of those gasoline-types. You poured the gasoline in a little  tank above, and it gravity-fed down into the carburetor. Then it had a  spark plug in there that she would take out and clean every time she did  the washing. My brother, Orrin, younger than me   two years younger  than me   made trips out in the city, just around town, instructed every  house and asked,    Do you have any washing for Mom to do today?        Yes, we have. We   ve got a few.    Then they   d bring out a little,  wrapped up in a towel or a blanket or something, and then we   d put  them in there and put them in the wagon, every day Mom washing. She  knew what everybody wanted. She   d fix them up for them, and then  we   d deliver them again in a little four wheeled wagon with wheels  about that high. (Gestures)  Hard work.  It was. But we didn   t notice hard work about it. We just noticed where  we were going with them and who we delivered to, and collect from the  lady the amount of money and then take it to Mom. She was the cashier.  She   d take all the money you get to her and she   d do the rest of it. She   d  buy groceries and stuff for that, clothes, everything we needed down  there. My dad worked in the cotton gin. That was an experience. He   d  get up every morning before I even woke up, and he   d be gone by the  time I got awake and eat breakfast, walked seven miles from Calvin into  Holdenville, and fire a cotton gin   put coal in there, get the temperature  up, the steam up. I guess he did that for about eight years. I never got to  see my dad. He   d come in late after he   d quit work and he   d go to bed  while I was already asleep. That was something.  And that was the closest cotton gin, was in Holdenville?  12  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  No.  Was there one in Calvin?  Calvin.  Calvin had one, too?  Yes.  Could you tell when you were a young boy that the Depression was  going on?  Yes, we had a rough time during the Depression. Dad would sit down  and he   d count the money out that we had left out in the washing  machine and his job. He   d count out the money, and he   d issue out  enough money for us to buy pants, a shirt, and socks   shoes if we  needed them. I got one pair of shoes a year. It was pretty rough back in  the Depression years. My dad would tell a funny story about    Hoover  was the president then. He would run along beside a rabbit and feel of  his ribs, and see how fat he was. (Laughs) Oh, Lord  My dad was quite a  funny guy. He would tell some stories once in a while. One time   I told  Chris about this   my dad was deputy sheriff in Hughes County. He said,     I told that boy to let that girl alone and let her go back home where she  belongs.    And he didn   t do it. So, he said,    I had a .45,    and he pulled  that .45 out and handled like this. (Gestures) He didn   t dare shoot him,  but he said,    Now, I said for you to turn that girl loose and let her go      So, he said,    Bye,    and she left and went on home. (Laughs) But  nowadays, he didn   t let my mother say that. He took a liking to her. He  and my mother got along fine forty-four years, I think. I lived with her  and not a cross word between either one of us. We just had a big time all  the time. I miss her  (Laughs)  Now, your dad was the night policeman there in Calvin. How did he  describe his job, as being the head what?  Okay. Now, he got to be a janitor in Calvin school for a while and he got  money that way. Let   s see, what else did he do?  Well, he said he was the head of the CBI, right?  Yes.  What   s the CBI?  I forgot now, what that name was. (Laughs)  13  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  He said he was the head of the Calvin Bureau of Investigation.  Yes, that   s it   Well, what did your dad think about Roosevelt?  He thought Roosevelt was the answer to all the problems. People from  businesses all around, he did things for people down in my part of the  country, organized the WPA  Works Progress Administration . Dad got  a job with them, building bridges and school buildings. He built a lot of  things there with that. He had a pretty good outfit to work for. It was the  government then. He liked that job. He didn   t get to keep it very long,  but he mixed mortar. This stuff you put in between the bricks. Then  sidewalks, they   d lay down big pieces of board and fill it with concrete,  and it was a walk.  Did you have electricity growing up?  Oh, yes.  Electricity when you were growing up, did you have electricity in your  home as a little boy?  Well, most of the time, yes, but a lot of times we didn   t have any lights  at all. When we did get lights, boy, we used them. I tell you we used  them  I   ve sat down, laid down by the fireplace and get to lighting the  fire to write out my lessons by the light from that fireplace.  When did you get electric light?  It was   oh  About the time of year change, I guess. In the    40s to    50s.  So, you had a wind charger on the farm?  No, the only wind charger we had was when the wind blew out up  through the chimney. (Laughs) Mom would cook on that fire, lots. She  would just take a skillet, run in there, and set it on that fire, fry up bacon,  eggs, bacon and eggs for breakfast   good stuff  I don   t get it much  anymore. (Laughs)  Now, your dad built that house in Calvin before you were born, right?  Yes.  When was it wired for electric lights?  14  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Oh, mercy  About 1940, 1938, between 1938 and    40.  What was bath time like, when you   d have to take a bath?  Oh, yes  We used a number three washtub. (Laughs)  On the porch or in the kitchen?  Mom said,    You   re next, Melvin. Get in here  Get your clothes      (Laughter) It was a whirlpool.  Where   d you put the tub, on the porch or in the kitchen?  It doesn   t matter, it was in the hallway or wherever. (Laughter)  Once a week, or whenever Mom felt like it?  Well, she didn   t do much but just put a little soap on us and,    Here, you  can do the rest.    It   s about like what Whirlpool does for you.  At night how would you stay warm?  Blankets. We had lots of blankets. She would quilt, sew quilts on the  framework. I helped her a lot of time sewing up a quilt. You make short  stitches. You go up and down on them, pretty good. Boy, they were  warm. They were two pieces of regular material and then cotton in  between. That   s what we had for blankets. It worked good. They were  really warm.  Would you ever get into mischief, trouble?  Did I ever get into mischief? Oh, yes  The teacher told us,    Now, this  concrete line down through here is the boundary line between the  playground and the outside world. Don   t go over there.    Well, while she  wasn   t looking I just stepped over the line over there to see what was  over there. I got back and she said,    Oh, you   ve been out of bounds,  huh?       Yes.       Over here.    I went over there,    Do you know how to grab  your ankles?    I said,    Yes.       Well, get them.     Claps  Right on my rear  with a paddle. That was pretty rough. I said,    I won   t do that anymore.     (Laughs) That school was pretty good. It was pretty good. I liked the  teachers. They all seemed to be nice. Mrs. Olsen, Ms. Kimp, let   s see  what else. I had another one, old timer   Leach  Ms. Leach. She was a  good teacher. She could teach me things that I didn   t think I   d ever  learn. She would teach me how to count by two   s, how to count by  four   s, five   s, six, right on down the line. She   d teach me all that stuff  15  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  and I   d learn it. She said,    You   re doing good.     Would you have girlfriends?  Then, girlfriends?  Yes.  Oh, once in a while, maybe, one or two I   d kind of consider as a  girlfriend. There was one living down there in the channel, down there,  Cici Keith. That was her name, Cici Keith. She had a little sister  named    I don   t remember now what her name was. That was when I  was just about ready to graduate anyhow. My wife, she saw to it that I  got the education and graduation. That   s Chris    grandmother.  When you were getting ready to graduate from high school, did you  know what you wanted to be when you got older?  Yes, we were given a test. Final exams, I dreaded those things, boy.  You   d have to sit and scratch your head a lot, and write a little bit and  find out what was going on, scratch your head a little more. (Laughs)  Finally, I   d get it. Yes. But I didn   t make good grades when I was in  school. I did good to get a C.  Did you go into the military?  Yes, in    41, wasn   t it, Chris?  Early    42, maybe.  Yes,    41 or    42. I got into the Navy and I got to work on airplanes in the  Navy. I had a buddy that flew all the time and when I wanted to go  somewhere, I   d just get to crawl into the seat with him and he   d take me  somewhere. (Laughs) But it wasn   t very often, which sometimes the  boss wasn   t watching while I was getting in the plane. Then, I worked in  an aircraft plant, Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach, California. That was  good work. I got good pay. Everything worked fine.  Now, what were you doing when you were stationed in Norman in the  Navy?  When I finished school?  When they sent you to Norman.  I went to aircraft school, maintenance school. That was pretty  16  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  interesting. I graduated out of that class, too.  How did you meet your wife?  Singing  She sang in a girls    quartet and I sang in a boys    quartet. We   d  just get together every once in a while. (Laughs) I   ll tell you about my  wife and I, we never had one cross word with each other all the time we  were married, some forty years, wasn   t it?  Oh, longer than that.  Yes.  It was   well, this October it would   ve been seventy years.  Wow.  Yes. Boy, I mean we just got along just fine. She loved me and I loved  her. I hated to see her go, but on one August day, the Lord just came  down and took her by the hand and took her on down to Glory Land.  She   s waiting in the Streets of Glory. She was lying over there beside  me and I could tell she was struggling. I punched the button on the side  of the bed and here came the nurse. I said,    My wife doesn   t seem to be  doing very good.    So, she took a test stethoscope and went over, listened  over. Finally, she came back over there and said,    She   ll be all right.    I  figured it out since then. She was passing away right then, and that girl  just didn   t want me to have attention. I had so many experiences a lot of  times. My brother was a boxer.  Really?  Yes, he was quite a boxer and he was in the Navy, too. He says,    Oh, I   d  like to see these two brothers put on some gloves together.    I said,    No,  I don   t fight.       Yes, c   mon.    He said,    They want to see you two fight.     So, finally I said,    I   ll put on the gloves with him, but I   m not a boxer.        Okay.    So, we got into the room together   bam  Bam  Just like that,  all on the chin, down I went to the floor. I pulled the gloves off, handed  them to the boys on the side and I said,    Now, are you satisfied? That   s  all I   m doing.    (Laughs)  Before the Navy, would you box in high school?  No. I just wasn   t a fighter.  Right.  17  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  He was. He won plenty of bouts.  So, he would box growing up?  He was the boxer, yes.  Who taught him how to box?  George Morris, the grocery man down there. He took an interest in him.  He said,    Fuzzy, I want you to       Fuzzy, that   s what he called him,  Fuzzy. His hair just stood straight up. He said,    I want you to put on  gloves and box a little bit. Well, he taught him how. He said,    If you see  a glove coming at you, hold that other glove in front of it.    He said,    If  you can   t do that, dodge it.    (Laughter)    Do something, anything to get  away from the hard punching.    He took him to several bouts, all of  Hughes County, Seminole County, Shawnee County, took him all over.  He   d put him on display, and I didn   t get to go. I didn   t want to. I just  wanted to stick around the house.  I figure some betting was going on. Betting?  Wagering? Gambling on the boxing matches?  Oh, no   yes, there was some betting, but they were done quietly  because there was not supposed to be any gambling of any kind. But we  could tell that there was money exchanged.  What about prohibition? Was it a dry county?  Yes. It was dry.  Were there bootleggers around?  A little bit.  A little bit?  Yes, there was a little bit. They   d get by with it somehow or another.  Did you ever see hobos around?  Well, we lived close to two railroads, Rock Island and KOG, Kansas,  Oklahoma and Gulf. They crossed right there in Holdenville, and there   d  be people stopping in there and getting off the train, coming up. They  were called bums. They   d come around because they were hungry, and  Momma would always say,    You sit down on the front porch out there,  18  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  and I   ll bring you something to eat.    And he   d do it. She   d bring him  something to eat. Boy, they   d eat it all  (Laughs) Mom was one person  and she couldn   t stand to see anybody suffer anything   from starvation,  especially.  Would your mom sing?  Oh, yes. She was a charter member in the Calvin Baptist Church. That  says a lot, Charter member means that   s one of the first. Then her  daughter was right behind her on that side, and she got to be a charter  member. That   s his mother.  Was that Eunice?  No, it was    Well, no it wasn   t her.  Oh, okay.  She didn   t get in on it, but your mother did.  So, your mother sang and she played an instrument, didn   t she?  No, we were just members, then. We didn   t have any duties at all. She  taught school, and Mom taught school, together, both of them. They   d  have a little singing every once in a while at school.  But your mother played the organ, right?  She sure did. Her brother-in-law, George Hardwick, was song leader in  church. He got up one morning and said,    Well, we   re going to sing     Onward Christian Soldier.    He says,    Play the introduction,    so, she  played it.  Imitates organ  He started singing. He started singing about  twice that fast. She stopped after the little chance she got and said,     Look here, George Hardwick  If you want me to lead the singing,  you   re going to have to slow down quite a bit     And he slowed down.  He didn   t want to lose her because she was the only one in the whole  congregation that could play organ. That was pretty interesting, I  thought.  When you were younger, what were holidays like? Christmas?  Holidays?  Yes.  Well, we would get out of school on important holidays, which were  19  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Christmas, New Year   s, Fourth of July, and all that, national holidays.  The holidays we had then were very scarce. But when they   d come  around they   d tell us we   d be off this coming Friday. That   s Christmas  day. They said,    You   ll be off then. Come back to school next Monday.     Would you ever see Santa Claus?  Yes, he   d come down every once in a while with his little bag, wanting  somebody to put something in it for somebody else. Everyone, we  exchanged gifts a lot. My girlfriend, I   d always put something in that  bag with her name on it, and she   d get it. We   d have a party, a Christmas  party, and get to read all the names that were on the gifts. That was  pretty good.  Would you ever go to a pie supper?  Pie supper?  Yes.  Yes, we had pie suppers every once in a while. The church did that,  mostly, and that brought money for the church. They had guys around  sitting, standing around with a pocket full of money and they   d always  bid on a pie. She   d get a pretty good price for her pie. And his mother,  she   d get a good price for her pies, too. Are you learning anything?  I am  I am. (Laughter) When you were in high school, did you have a  job?  Did I have a job?  Yes.  Yes, I helped my dad a lot. He was janitor. I   d sweep a broom or two for  him. It didn   t help him that much. That was about it. I didn   t get any  money for my part of it. What I got was put on my feet, my clothes, and  gloves now and then.  Well, what would you do for fun?  In the wintertime we   d roll down a hill on a sled. We   d get on the sled  and go down that hill on the sled. Then, in the summertime we   d go  swimming down at the river, the South Canadian River. That was pretty  good. I learned to swim in a little creek by the name of Hay Creek, just  about a half-mile from my house. I   d go down there every day or two  and learn to swim. By myself   20  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  By yourself   Yes.  What if you ever drowned?  It wasn   t deep enough. I could stand up in it, easy. But I   ve got a little  interesting story to tell about that. When I was in the Navy, I was  swimming instructor. In the group, one boy, he   d go along with that rail  that runs along with the sides on down there. He   d hold onto that rail and  paddle with his other hand. I said,    How are you getting along?       Oh,  I   m doing excellent     he said. I said,    You are?       Yeah.       You get a lot  of confidence with that rail, don   t you?       Yeah, if I can get ahold of that  rail, I   ll make it.    I said,    You   re in the Navy and you know what?  Anytime you are assigned to board a ship anywhere, it   s subject to  getting sunk.    I said,    What if that ship sinks? You won   t find a bar  down there to hold onto.    I said,    If you do, you   re going to drown right  quick.       Oh,    he says,    I guess I better learn how to swim.    I said,    Yes,  you had.    I could swim across the field, across the pond, the swimming  pool, underwater all the way, fifty feet. A lot of times I did that. I had  fun at it. Well, every once in a while some of the boys would get to  come home. I   d get to go home. Then we would all be there. We had  four brothers in the Navy at one time during World War II, so I was five.  About that time, the story of the Sullivan Brothers came out, and every  one of us had that story.  Did your parents ever give you any words of advice growing up that are  still with you today?  Always giving me advice  They   d give all of us advice. They were good  instructors. Yes, they wouldn   t teach you wrong. It was pretty good.  Now, you mentioned the Sullivan brothers. Who were they?  Five Sullivan brothers were onboard a ship, one ship, and it got  torpedoed and down it went. They lost five of those boys out of that  family at one time. The legislation came through with momentum. No  brothers will be serving on any battleships, anytime. When those  Sullivan boys passed away on that ship, it was a sad deal, a sad story.  They were good guys. I didn   t get to meet any of them, but boy, they  were awful good guys. People just loved to hear them talk.  How long were you in the Navy?  Four years.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Then you were ready to get out?  Yes. That   s when this pretty little girl came along and took me by the  arm and said,    Hey, let   s go see the preacher.    (Laughter)  Was she from Oklahoma?  Yes, she was from Calvin.  Holdenville.  Holdenville, yes, Holdenville. I went to Holdenville a lot. Yes, that   s  right. She was from Holdenville.  Well, what was the first car that you can remember your father having?  Model-T Ford  I had the job of putting the jack under the rear wheel, so  it would serve as kind of a flop wheel for it when he cracked it. He   d put  it in gauge and gauge the rear wheel, and it drove. That   d keep it going  when it was slapping a little bit. The gas supply was in the carburetor  and when that would burn out the wheels would just keep going, rolling.  And all he   d have to do was just reach up, flip the switch on that  carburetor, and then put a new spot of gas in and it   d run.  Would you ever get to drive it?  No   No?  No  I didn   t get to drive a car until I was sixteen, I guess, fifteen.  What about a tractor?  Like a farm tractor?  Oh. Yes, I worked a lot on the farm when I was growing up.  How old were you when you drove a tractor?  I didn   t get to drive a tractor. This little girl came along and she was  good at that. So, she did all the driving of the tractor. Gathering the corn,  I went along and picked the corn off the stocks, pitched them over in the  wagon that this tractor was pulling. Boy, she knew just exactly where to  go with it. She knew where the barn was, what side of that barn to park  22  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Powell  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  it, unload it, and go back at it some more.  Did you have any desire to want to become a farmer?  Not much. My dad worked too hard on the farm, anyhow. He worked all  the time. I didn   t do a lot, but I helped a little bit once in a while and I  didn   t especially care for it. I thought a farmer was kind of low class  about that time, a sharecropper especially. One that shared in the  harvesting of it. Yes, my dad said,    Now, you see that row of corn right  there?       Yes.       Well, you can count the number of stalks in that row and  I get a third of it.    Every third stalk was ours.  You did always have a vegetable garden, though. All your life you had a  vegetable garden, right?  Raised vegetables?  Vegetable garden with tomatoes and beans and stuff.  Oh, yes. Yes, we had vegetables. Momma always had a garden. You   d  have to go pull the weeds out of the garden every once in a while. I do it  today. I   ve got little gardens in    you   ve probably seen them. Anyhow,  they   re scattered all around. You   d have to go down there and pull the  weeds out of them every once in a while. I was good at it. Boy, I could  just tell the grass root, Bermuda grass, it could wiggle a lot. It had to get  loose from the roots where they   d pull it out of the ground. Pull them  out, and put them over here in the road. In the road, I called it   the path.  Girls bragged on me a lot about that. They said,    Here, you go on in  now. You   ve been pulling those weeds all morning.    I said,    Yes, I  enjoy it.    I said,    Mom always put me to pulling weeds in the garden. I  enjoy it.    I enjoyed getting out because we didn   t get out very much.  Well, looking back on those days, is there something that just really  brings back memories of the 1930s that   s still with you today?  1930s, let   s see     You growing up     I didn   t belong to any military service, then. 1930s. I guess about the  only thing I was kind of interested in was my grades during that period. I  loved to make good grades, and I didn   t make very good ones. I thought  a C was a good grade. (Laughs)  Well, you did pretty well for yourself.  23  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Nykolaiszyn  Swinhart  Thank you. I tried. (Laughter)  And you   re still singing, right?  Yes.  You   re still singing and keeping busy.  Yes, keeping busy. I got tickled at some guy trying to spell my name.  They   d write it out, my first name, of course, was easy to write, M-E-L-V-  I-N. Then, Swinhart, that   s where they lost it out, S-W-I-N-E-H-A-R-T,  and I said,    No E in my last name.       What?  It says Swinehart     I  said,    Yes, I know it says that. There   s no E in it.       All right.    So, it got  to where they   d spell it without the E.  Well, Melvin, it has been a pleasure talking with you today.  Well, I   m having a little bit of fun anyhow.  I appreciate it.  Bringing back old memories     Thank you so much.  Well, you   re welcome. That   s everything I had.  -------  -------
