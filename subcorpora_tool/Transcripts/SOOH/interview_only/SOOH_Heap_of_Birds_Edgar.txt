 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, January  12, 2011 and I   m interviewing Edgar Heap of Birds as part of the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Edgar   s  studio in Oklahoma City. Edgar, you   re a member of the Cheyenne-  Arapaho tribe, a full professor at the University of Oklahoma, and an  artist with a national and international imprint. I really appreciate your  taking the time to talk with me.  Sure. It   s good to be here  to speak to you .  You were born in Wichita, Kansas, and lived there through high school.  What was it like growing up there?  Well, it was a kind of an underprivileged area. It was mixed race, south  part of town. Plain View is the name of the district. But it was mainly a  lot of aircraft workers. That   s what Wichita all is   Beech, Cessna,  Boeing, Lear Jet. My father was an aircraft factory worker for twenty-eight  years and raised his family, six kids, up in Kansas.  Was your mom a homemaker?  She was a homemaker. Then, later when we got a little bit older, she  went to work for the aircraft factory as well. There was actually a pretty  tight-knit urban Native community, mixed tribal, inter-tribal community  in Wichita.  So were you involved with the Indian community there, your family?  Yes, and my Cheyenne relatives were in the area, too. Came up from  Oklahoma to find jobs.  What experiences did you have with art in public school?  5  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Not too much. Just the regular kinds of things   when there was nothing  else to do, they   d make you do art. (Laughter) But the odd thing about  that, I have to say, is that I did a lot of drawing as a kid. That   s what I  look for most artists to be saying, too. When they were youth, they drew  a lot, compulsively   which I did, and another kid did, too. So, in third  grade I got an art scholarship to an art institute, in this really  impoverished little school. It was sort of a fancy art studio program  outside of town, on the edge of town. And I got my first art experience  from being in that little school.  Was it like a summer program?  It was an after  school , kind of evening program, and Saturdays. I  learned how to do some drawing, like spheres and triangles. Typical,  sort of boring studio  work . Charcoal. Later I became a drawing  professor. I   d teach drawing at Yale University, all that. But I did that  when I was in third grade, actually.  Did your family make a lot of trips back and forth to Oklahoma?  Yes, and my dad sort of taught us that we weren   t really from Kansas,  although I went to KU, and I really like the Jayhawks. But Oklahoma   s  where we came from. I came back after grad school in London and  Philadelphia to Oklahoma. My dad retired from Beech Aircraft and  came home, so we   re all back pretty much now. Back in Oklahoma.  You started school at Haskell Indian Nations University before it was a  university.  Well, I was at KU  University of Kansas , actually. I just took a couple  classes  at Haskell . I studied with Dick West at my own desire, but I   m  a KU art student. Haskell was just kind of a side bar to my time in  Lawrence, Kansas.  Can you talk about studying with Dick West, and what kinds of things  you were exposed to?  Well, he was pretty parochial about how he dealt with Native Art. I  mean, we had almost like    war dance class    painting. But it was his off-the-  cuff remarks that were great. We   re related through one of my  grandmothers, and he knew that. He didn   t know what I  did  as an  artist   he wasn   t really privy to that. But he said something to me one  time. He said that as an artist   I, he, we   should take the white man   s  expectation and then feed it back to them like it was blankity-blankity,  and make them eat it. He said different words than that. And here come  6  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  all my interventions, all my public art, all my efforts that take the  dominant culture   s expectations or their values and then you turn it  around and cut them with it. I don   t think about Dick West when I do  that, but he was aware of that kind of perspective.  Right. So you were at KU. What kinds of things were you doing over  there?  At KU I did the Foundations Program, a very rigorous program. KU is a  serious art school, so they had two-dimensional design, 3-D design, life  drawing, a really rigorous art history   the book Jansen, the big thick art  history book   and then an elective. That was your freshman semester.  So, it was really hard. I did that for a year, and then I was privileged  enough to be chosen as one of the outstanding freshmen in the program.  A lot of people came from art academies and probably had a lot of other  training, but I worked really hard and that led me on to distinctions, and  I got other scholarships from the painting program. But I went into  design   a lot of people might have empathy for this   coming out of the  aircraft factory mentality that you had to have some kind of vocational  skill. I still didn   t understand what college really was, or how open  ended it could be. So, I went right after freshmen year into design,  graphic design, and then with text and all kinds of stuff like that. And  oddly enough, their leading professor told me I was ill-equipped to  handle words in my practice, that I wasn   t really good at it. I should  probably think of something else.  Now I   m  publishing and designing  and all that, which, I do all the time. I   m making a piece about South  Africa in the next two hours.  Anyway, his perspective was that I wasn   t really a client-based artist,  I   m not the kind of artist that  someone  comes in and says,    We have   handicapped  children. We want a postage stamp by Wednesday that  has  handicapped  kids on it. We want you to make people feel sorry        I am more creative in my own outlook. I   m not going to go make a dog  food thing, and then make something else for the Post Office. And he  was right. So, I went into painting, and did painting all throughout KU,  and became one of the main painting students they had. I went to  London after that, and went to California before that, and followed these  really very, very brilliant painters at KU. We had ten, which is amazing,  ten painting professors who came from Yale, Berkley, Seattle, Illinois,  RISD  Rhode Island School of Design . So, I was taught by really  leading painters of the day, and they taught me where they came from.  Then I ended up going to all those places. I   ve taught at Yale, I taught at  RISD, I went to school in London Royal College of Art. All these places  that sort of showed me I was able to go forward.  Were you doing much abstract work? Was that your focus?  7  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Yes, I was doing abstract painting. And also some installations   sort of  tactile, with fabric and rope. Still based on a premise of beauty and  design, but three-dimensional kind of pieces.  You definitely got a global head start by pursuing graduate studies at  the Royal College of Art in London. What was that like?  Well, that was a great experience. It was very challenging, and again, it  was like, Howard Hodgkin was a professor there. Howard Hodgkin   he  has a piece that   s still up, it   s at the Met. I saw it at the Met the other day  when I was in New York City. So, Howard is like Art History. Francis  Bacon lived down the road in Chelsea   it   s that kind of place. David  Hockney went to school where I went to school. The Royal College of  Art is one of the leading colleges in the world for painting. Peter de  Francia was the chair. He lives part of every year in France, and then in  London, but he gave me a scholarship just to go look around Europe. He  was a great guy. He said,    You need to go to Europe,    so he gave me  some money, and he gave me an itinerary of his favorite  art collections   to see in Europe, and I took off.  Where did you go?  The first trip, I took a boat to Amsterdam and then saw the Van Gogh  Museum in Amsterdam, and then went to Harlem and Frans Hals  Museum. Looked at stuff in Northern Europe. Went across to Reuben   s  house in Antwerp, and then Paris, to see all the things in Paris. I came  back to London, and that was my circuit. The next time, I took a train to  Rome through the Swiss Alps. I went to the Vatican, the Sistine Chapel,  Florence, along Pisa, back to the Riviera, along del Monaco and hang  out in Nice, and see the Picasso Museum in  Biot , and the Leger  Museum  in South of France , and then come back to Paris. I still have  his note he gave me. He   s a major figure in art, and he showed me where  to go, and I followed his directions. I had a big show, of course, with the  National Museum of American Indians in Venice, so we were in Italy.  We go to Italy a lot, but anyway   all those times. And it   s just  continued to grow. My son   s been to Italy with me, and Paris, too, so we  continue that same legacy today.  What a great art education. Was that your first time out of the country?  Yes, it was. It was a big shock. From Wichita, Kansas, to London,  England just knocked me out. I couldn   t hardly stand it. I was covered  with soot. I was covered with black dust from the buses and the coal  being fired in all the furnaces and stoves. I hated it for about three  months. I couldn   t take the business and the noise. Then, of course, in  8  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  four or five months, I loved it, and I wanted to move to New York City  after being in  London . That   s why I went to the school in Philadelphia,  because it was actually close to New York.  At Temple University?  At Temple. Tyler School of Art. Actually, I applied to Yale and to  RISD, and to Tyler, and I got rejected from both the other places. Then I  got accepted to Tyler, and in an odd kind of poetic way, I   ve been  professor at both the other places. It cost them a lot more money to have  me come, than the other way around. (Laughs) So I   ve visited all the  other places and taught there.  When and where did you first begin showing your artwork for sale?  Gallery-wise? I   ve had more museum exhibits, I think. I   m more  focused on that. I don   t really sell much work. I work on my own kind of  level, my own kind of desire, and I don   t make much for anyone   s  purchasing. If they want to buy it, I like them to buy everything they can  buy, but I don   t really  make art for  that. So my first museum show, I  was twenty-six years old, and it was a museum in Philadelphia. I was  still on the East Coast, and was showing in New York a bit, in an artist-run  gallery space and museum exhibits. I   ve kind of done that, and I  continue to do that, oddly enough, twenty years later. I   m still showing  in museums and artist-run galleries and very few commercial galleries.  Was it scary having your first museum show? Do you remember how  you felt about it?  Yes, I was very bad, in the sense of being more egotistical as a youth.  You think you   re  going  to sell everything.    I should get a gallery show  and I should be on fire.    And they said,    Well, no you   re not, actually.  You   re not very important.    And nothing happened. I got my work out,  and then I got an understanding of what I was doing. But I   ve continued  just to work in that same manner. It started me out as a way to handle  space in a museum. I can handle the actual space, rather than just exhibit  the painting or the drawing on a wall. I tend to kind of overcome the  actual environment with my work, and create a sensibility. So that was a  beginning. I also did some historical curating, too, with the University of  Pennsylvania. It was an ethnographic museum, so I was able to show all  my contemporary work. Then I had a satellite exhibit in an adjoining  space from the museum collection, with their antiquities from the  Prairie, a huge, anthropological kind of museum space. I took all the  work out of there from Cheyenne-Arapaho history and put it with my  show. So, they had both.  9  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  You were pretty prominent on the New York art scene in the 1980s. Can  you talk a little bit about some of the work you did there?  Well, the main thing, I guess, was the piece at Times Square. It   s called  In Our-Language, my first public art piece. It   s what you call a  billboard. At that time, I was really very privileged to be working with  Keith Haring. Keith Haring had a piece there, a major artist. David  Hammons, Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holtzer   all these people that have  become historical figures. We were all young in the    80s, so that was my  first splash into the art scene. Lucy Lippard was on the committee to  choose me, and she   s a major critic book author on contemporary art. I  was able to pick the  writers  for my Venice Biennale project so I  actually chose her to write for the book. She   s in a book that I have now.  She wrote a major essay. We still are friendly. So, it was great. I still go  back to New York a lot. I still work in New York. I really enjoy the  atmosphere and the work there, and I send a lot of students there from  OU as a painting professor. I have about three or four professional artists  living in New York City who are my painting students, so I channel  students from here to New York.  Did you get a grant to do that project at Times Square?  They chose ten artists, or twelve. It was a competition, and Hans Haacke  was one of those that they were looking at, so they picked ten of us. We  had a month apiece   each artist had a month, and every twenty minutes,  your message came up on the big computer billboard. And my piece, of  course, was just a translation of what  the word  for white man is in  Cheyenne, which is spider. So I told everyone,    You   re a spider. You  make fences, you make reservations, you capture things, you kill things,  you wrap it up.    I think the main thing about that, which I   d like to  expand on for everyone else, is that   s what we need more of. Not an  artist coming forward from a Native community to talk about themselves  or the community, which is always a desire of the white man, to hear  about our  cultural ways . I think we should come out and talk about  them. Given the opportunity to talk, don   t talk about yourself, talk about  them  , the dominant society . Talk about the plight or the circumstance  you find yourself in. Native artists will very rarely do that.  Going back to your other question about galleries, that   s the problem.  The gallery is going to sell what you make, and make it kind of palatable  for the gallery patron to buy something. And are they going to buy  something about themselves? Probably not. Or a good straight discourse  about political upheaval in Native America? No. But if you give them  some kind of coyote story, they   re going to buy that. And they   re going  to be happy, you   re going to have some money, but we   re going to get  nowhere. So, anyway, I did that in Times Square. And actually, I had a  10  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  very upset stomach for like three weeks. I couldn   t eat, because I had  written that whole piece about,    White man   s a spider.    I sent it to New  York, and I was going to go to New York and make it on the computer.  And then they had censored Hans Haacke before me. Hans Haacke is a  major political artist, and he does a lot of very hard edge stuff, so they  kicked him out of the program. I was coming, and I knew I wasn   t going  to change my text, and so I had this kind of internal medical problem.  The moment I saw my text on the billboard, I got well. Sort of like  Woody Allen, he was fine after he wasn   t on TV. I don   t do that  anymore, and I   m fine with challenges like that, but that was a  beginning, to go back to what Dick West said, to put excrement in their  face, and make them eat it. Say something about them from our  perspective, and so I had to keep doing that in all my work.  Was there any reaction from the newspapers?  Yes, it was in The Village Voice. We made a film, too, so it traveled the  world on film. It was on  at an  international video festival. And it keeps  being played. It   s in books   it   s art history. One project in Hartford,  Connecticut, where a curator picked me up at a major museum,  he  told  me at the airport that I was his thesis question for his MA. If he didn   t  know me, he would have flunked. He said,    Man, I   m glad I knew who  you were, because I wouldn   t have gotten my Master   s degree.    The  Times Square piece was part of that time, so it   s good.  That   s a real compliment to your impact. Many of these things that  you   re talking about are concept art. Can you define concept art for us?  Well, conceptual art, I find a lot of that can be based on like a process,  say, not on the outcome that you see visually. It could be a process of,     How did you make it?       How did you form it?    And then,    What are  the priorities involved with it?    What   s interesting for me, maybe  everyone else should know this, too, certainly. Given all these years     I   ve got like twenty years in ceremonial learning. So, I   m an instructor,  and I   m in the middle of all these Cheyenne ceremonial ways for the last  twenty-plus years. That   s why I live in Oklahoma. And all those things  are about process, see. They   re not about the outcome. The outcome of  Native art has been a white man   s design. You see something, it is  narrative, it has a story, and so on.  All the things within ceremonial learning are symbolic. There   s no need  for a narrative because we are the narrative. We   re the living narrative.  We would dance, there wouldn   t be a picture of us dancing in the dance.  Why would they make a painting of us dancing in the dance? We   re  going to just dance. Or  there   s  going to be a song, a prayer. None of it  is narrative, in a picture. That   s someone else   s design. And it   s a big  11  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  fallacy that many artists re-create for their white patrons. So, if you  really understand your own religious doctrine as a Native person, it   s  going to be in symbolism and in process, maybe directional   to the sun  and the stars and Polaris, and all these things that are up above us.  You   re going to do something in that direction. You   re not going to  make a painting of yourself, doing something that direction. You   re  going to have to face that star.  So, the process and the issue of conceptual art is Indian  , in a traditional  and modern manner . It   s at the basis of all of our religious practice. The  symbolism and the priorities involved, not necessarily the visual  outcome of it. I   ve learned that over the years, and it   s been great with  my art practice because I continue to make memorial stuff. I  made  a  big impression in Venice, Italy for Buffalo Bill   s warriors, who died all  over Europe. I made a memorial because I came to Italy for the Venice  Biennale. They came to Venice, also, in the 1890s, to  perform  a Wild  West Show. And they were mistreated, and they died. They   re buried all  over Europe. So, when I would come to Europe, what should I make? I  should make a memorial. I shouldn   t make a piece about myself or my  tribe. I should make something about the tribes that were lost there. Just  that kind of mentality, of making the memorial song first. Like when  you have a  Cheyenne social  dance, what   s the first song? Memorial  song. You don   t have a dance for me. It could be a dance for me or my  son going to college or whatever   they   re not going to have a song for  us. They   re going to have the memorial song first to honor all those that  have passed on. Then, a little bit later, they   re going to get to you. That  kind of prioritizing is what I think is best, but it   s traditional. So, that   s  what I do with my art practice.  Did you hook up with Indian artists back East? Or has that been a  bigger part of your life in Oklahoma? Conceptual artists.  Yes, I did. The American Indian Community House had a gallery, which  is a Native American social service center, and they have their own  gallery, which was a very provocative gallery, a good gallery. And they  put it in SoHo, when Leo Costelli had his gallery on West Broadway, so  it was in the right area, and we showed there. Peter Jamison was the  director. He   s a Seneca man. He  now  lives on his reservation in upstate  New York. He   s a ceremonial leader up there. He left the city, maybe  twenty years ago, but yeah, we had a lot of good kind of community  things happening. And, also, artists that were not Native, certainly. I  have a lot of friends and I work in the Native Art world, somewhat, but  also be able   I wouldn   t call it being ghettoized, but you don   t want to  limit yourself to that. You have all kinds of colleagues, globally, and  Native Art or Santa Fe or the Indian Market, or even stuff in Oklahoma  is just not very good. I mean, quality is very low. But the main thing is  12  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  the expectation is toward the white patron, in a particular kind of way.  So, that   s very limited. I don   t really tend to work in that vein too much.  When did you end up back in Oklahoma, and when did you begin  teaching at OU?  I came back to Oklahoma in    82 or    83, I think. I came back to find out  more about the ceremonial life. I was kind of on this very high trajectory  in the art world, and I actually had a piece in a show in SoHo, in  TriBeCa. I took my Volkswagen bus and drove to New York City  from  Philadelphia  and got my piece off the wall, and they said,    Are you  insane?    I was in SoHo Weekly News.    When are you moving to town?     (I was in Philly, ninety miles away.)    When are you moving downtown   New York City ?    I said,    I   m moving to Oklahoma.       We   ll never  hear from you again.       You   re an idiot.       You   re insane.    (Laughter)     You   re taking your piece to Oklahoma?    I still have it sitting here in  the back of my studio right now. But I needed to know more about the  ceremonial life. I had a lot of questions and I was misinformed,  uneducated about that.  I   m an  MFA, studied in London, all around, but  didn   t really know about that. So, I thought I had to find out.  I moved to my great-grandmother   s house in this canyon, west of Geary  by Yellowhair Hall. Didn   t have a road or a bathroom or electricity.  Lived out there and built a road,  installed  electricity, built an outhouse,  and plumbing, later on, ten years later. Shot with my shotgun and had a  garden. Had an old car that I broke the muffler off, every time I drove  down a country road. (Laughter) That was my life for about twelve  years. Then at the end of that twelve years, OU called me up one day     but for ten years I did artist-in-residence programs all over the state.  That   s how I made my money and got to work with children, which I  still do today. I really like that a lot. So I just made it work out. I did the  impossible, in a sense. I made a studio out there, too. Made all my work  out there. The Times Square piece came from out there. I went to New  York City to Times Square from that canyon out there, west of Geary.  Then OU called one day, and I was doing a project with Jimmie Durham  in Northern Ireland. I was set to go to London on this project, and they  called me,    Will you come be a professor?    It turned out, this guy who  was a professor ahead of me at OU got a Hollywood contract to write   for  TV, for like  200,000 or something. He  the writer  called home  and said,    I   m not coming back to OU.    And they said,    Well, put it in  writing. We heard that before.    And they called me and said,    We want  to give you his professorship and hire you.    I didn   t ask for no job. I  didn   t go there and talk to them. I wasn   t looking for that. But I said,     When?    And he said,    In two weeks.    And it   s like,    I can   t. I can   t do  that. I   ve got to go to Northern Ireland. I   ve got to go to Belfast. I   ve got  13  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  to go to London.    He said,    Well, you go, and we   ll give you two  assistants to  cover  your classes,  and  come back.    And I said,    Where  do I sign?    So I came down there and got a real job and health  insurance. My first son  born  in my family   I had a monthly payment  to the doctor to get him delivered. I had no health insurance. It was a  very scary thing to do with a family. So, that was great. That was  twenty-three years ago, and I   m still a professor at OU.  That   s wonderful. Can you talk about the Apartheid Oklahoma project  that you did in 1989, how that came about?  That was about looking at Native history in Oklahoma and linking it to  apartheid in South Africa. It was before Mandela was released, and I  made billboards about Oklahoma running over Indian nations. And  everyone knows, they have a celebration every year to commemorate  taking away Indian Territory, which is appalling. I say that all over the  world when I give lectures, and everyone just gasps. They pull little  wagons, and go on the playground, and have their lunch. People are like,     Man, that is so insensitive, we can   t even believe that happens.    That   s  Oklahoma   s legacy of insensitivity. So, I got with a public service  group   we work with youth. We did billboards, we did t-shirts, and we  did a protest march to the State Capitol on the day of the Land Run  commemorations. We had people give speeches, make a rebuttal about  that kind of insensitivity. So, it   s still a premise going forward,  comparing reservation insensitivity to South African apartheid  insensitivity. Between that time, in 2000, I worked and lived in Cape  Town. I had a studio in Cape Town. I was invited as a visiting artist  to  the  University of Cape Town. I taught there. I did a collaborative  project with black Indians in Rhode Island, and a black African from  Cape Town. So, I   ve been working in Africa, and in that kind of  brotherhood and community. Activism goes on.  The media tool that you use, the billboard, is not as widely seen,  probably, as a TV ad.  Yes, sure. My position is, over the years, you have to be inflammatory to  become noticed. You can   t just be courteous and nice, so I do that  almost instinctively. I do things that are inflammatory to dominant  culture, and then they get so pissed off about it, they publish it  as news .  It becomes part of  daily media . They make it visible. My billboard is a  tiny little thing. Almost my intent is to see that we get  that museum or  viewer  mad, put it in the newspaper, and  everyone then  sees that   That   s when I   m actually executing the piece is  when it   s in  the  newspaper or on television news programs.  In terms of    Apartheid Oklahoma,    or any other kind of installation art,  14  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  how important is it to you that they know who the author of the work is?  My name is on it, if they want to give credit. If they want to get mad at  me or something, they can. But it   s not really important at all. Often, I  don   t put my name anywhere, and people think,    Well, this has no  worth.    But it   s not really about me. It   s not a cult of personality. It   s  about just delivering the message.  I think it   s more potentially subversive, almost, if they don   t know who  the author is.  That   s a wonderful point, because then there can be the presumption that  the authorities made it, which is wonderful. They might think that  Oklahoma made that, the governor made that. (Laughter) I think that   s  what I want to do, usually, is be anonymous and  let them  think that the  authorities have put out this provocative thing.  What about the Medicine Wheel installation at the entrance to the  Denver Art Museum? Can you describe that?  Yes, that one had a different kind of focus because it was, that is, the  Fort Laramie Treaty territory. That was our first treaty that we lost with  the US government. And it goes back to when we did migrate between  the North and the South   Colorado and Wyoming and Nebraska. So, it  has a lot more of my tribal kind of affiliation on my sleeve. I don   t do  that very often, but that one had to be about our ceremonial  understanding. We actually spin  the installation  toward the Summer  Solstice Sunrise. We got two trees, tilted ten degrees to vector of that  sunrise. We GPS   d it. We did all this stuff to link it up with all of the  universe. So, me and my wife, I tease my wife about it because like,  here   s my nomenclature, the Big Dipper. That   s a pretty outstanding  nomenclature to have, all the universe  supporting your artwork . If you  want to take issue with it, go talk to the Big Dipper about it. He   s got  something to say to you.  So, that   s how that is. It   s not just a sculpture, it   s like our ceremonial  lodge in a symbolic manner. The tree and the months of the year and the  moons and all those things. And it   s autobiographical,  circular  arrangement of ten porcelain and steel fork trees  from a prehistory of  Anasazi to Pueblo to Dine. We got involved in that area, much, much  later in the 1800s. And how we traveled, with the massacres from  Washita and Sand Creek and Medicine Lodge Treaty, all that stuff that  happened to us. And my father being raised in a tent on Turtle Creek,  east of Clinton, Oklahoma, chopping ice off the coffee pot in the  morning, that lifestyle.  And  me, professor at OU, what I   ve done in  just fifty short years, to travel that far. And him being a worker.  15  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Education is paramount on the last tree   all the advanced degrees you  can earn. So, it   s kind of autobiographical.  But what it hasn   t done, it hasn   t spoken about the regression, which as I  get older, I   m getting more and more bitter about things going much  worse for Indians. I think it   s worse and worse and worse. We   re not  getting any better. And I   ve seen people in my nation and family   it   s  like you sort of head toward a peak, but then it kind of goes and crashes  again. I can   t say, in reality, that my sculpture   s really true, because it   s  really optimistic in coming out of the massacre, and finding your  ceremonial life, and going through Fort Marion  as P.O.W.   s  and all  these things. Okay, here we are, at Denver Art Museum. A half million  dollar sculpture, but no, it   s not all good. Things are really bad for  Indians   abusive behavior. But going back to the Sand Creek   Massacre  and going back to the Washita  Massacre , when they take  away your leadership, when they murder your children, put your  leadership in prison, where are the men? What are they going to do?  How are they going to recover from that in even fifty short years or one  hundred short years? And we haven   t. We haven   t recovered from that.  Dysfunction is huge. So, I   m looking at newer projects to articulate  some of that, because in my mind, the Denver sculpture   s kind of been   positive . It   s good to show children, here, learn your education, learn  your tribal heritage and come and be yourself. I want to give them that  optimistic note, but I want them to know, there   s also a chance you may  fall back down the hill again.  Let   s talk about the project    Building Minnesota.    Can you explain how  that came about and what it consisted of?  That was in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and it was part of a touring show I  put together of my work. It was called Claim Your Color, and Walker   Art Museum  is one of the major art museums in the world. They  brought my show to their museum, and they asked me to present it in the  gallery, in the big museum, but they also said,    If you want to, you can  do a public piece, too.    I got a song from Larry Long and Amos Owen,  which is called Water in the Rain, and  is  about the hangings of thirty-eight  Dakota Warriors by Abraham Lincoln. The chorus is,    Your tears,  when you cry from that, is like water in the rain.    It just flushes away.  You can   t overcome that. So, I had to make a piece about that. Abraham  Lincoln, during the Civil War, executed thirty-eight Dakota warriors.  After Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson killed two more. Hung  two more at Fort Snelling. The other thirty-eight were hung at Mankato,  Minnesota. So, I made forty panels about chest high, giving the Native  name of every warrior that was executed, and Abraham Lincoln at the  bottom   that he was responsible for it, and put them along Mississippi  where the granaries were, where the Gold Medal and Pillsbury granaries  16  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  are.  That discusses how the farmland was, why they were executed, that they  wanted to move the Sioux out of Minnesota, and take away the land and  make more farms. That   s why no one thinks of Sioux when they think of  Minnesota. They executed forty of their warriors, and  got  the tribe out  of there. There are still some on the  Minnesota  reservation, but it   s  very small, compared to South Dakota. That caused a huge uproar in  Minneapolis. They said,    Abraham Lincoln   s our hero. We thought he  freed the slaves.    No, he organized the largest mass execution in  America   s history. They called me the new Charles Manson. They said I  was a hate-monger to bring forward his name in such a way. But I didn   t  say,    You, so and so, so and so     or use profanity . I just said what he  did. I found the letter he wrote to send the names forward. Again,  America hides those things so well. I don   t know if anyone living in  Washington right now knew that. So, we need to go refigure Lincoln.  But if you didn   t know that Lincoln killed thirty eight warriors, what  else don   t you know? That   s my point. It   s like,    Whoa  That   s scary.  You don   t know that he   s authorized the largest mass execution then and  since?    No one   s done that since. We have a President   s day. He   s on  our money. He   s on the five dollar bill   he   s on the money. So, that   s  just horrible. I had to say something, and the  Indian  community really  embraced it. They came and blessed it, and people brought feathers and  bundles from sweat lodges and tied them on it. It was something that had  to be addressed. I   m not saying it was healed, but it was a beginning, to  actually engage it.  In addition to honoring the executed warriors and naming their  executioner, you   re honoring the environment that literally doesn   t exist  anymore. Like you said, the fish, the animals, the birds, the water,  everything that was there    How important is landscape in  communicating the message of your installations?  It   s really important. I think it begins with the land, and even when I  traveled, when I was in Africa, I went to Zimbabwe first. I went to see  the most ancient cave art I could find in the world, whether it was  Matapos Hills, in Bulawayo. I went to Great Zimbabwe two or three  times. I was in Botswana when these elephants went swimming  in the  river . I go to the Great Barrier Reef when I go to Australia. I work with  aboriginal artists. I go to Great Barrier Reef and swim and snorkel with  all the fish. I   m almost compelled to go back to the beginning, which is  the spirits of Nature, before we kind of got it all fouled up in many  ways, with human  misuse  and so on. I think it   s really important. The  paintings behind me are in progress. They   re called neuf, which is the  Cheyenne number four, but they go back to trees on the reservation by  Geary. The juniper trees that I watched and walked for ten years, and  17  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  then the fish I saw on the Great Barrier Reef when I snorkeled in St.  Croix, or in Thailand with my son. I still go back and paint these  remembrances, and they create a whole dialogue with me with Nature.  I   ve been doing it for twenty years. Started on the canyon out there in  Geary, and I still do that kind of work.  The natural world  kind of goes  in and out of my political discourse, but in my visual art-painted  discourse, Nature   s always at the center.  You   ve already addressed in some ways how travel has impacted your  work. What about teaching abroad? How is that cultural experience  different from going into a place for a few days or a week?  When you teach internationally, and even when you travel  internationally, I feel what it   s really about is making an exchange. It   s  not so much to go there and deliver something or to extract something. I  think as a citizen of the world, you really go forward to trade. So I take  my ideas and my teaching, and then I seek to get something back from  the students or from the place. I   ve done collaborative projects in South  Africa, Australia, and I   ve been working in Asia. I was in China just a  few months ago, Beijing and Shanghai.  And what I do, too   the paintings have taken me into some printmaking  processes that deal with cloth and fiber, fabric. I was in Java, Indonesia,  doing some work with some students, and then I got involved with batik.  I did some printing in Philadelphia and also in Korea. I make my own  silk scarves, too. But I collect fabric that   s printed from indigenous  cultures, and I make clothes out of it   I design clothes, too. When I was  in China, I went to a site that makes the indigo fabric. It   s a little canal  village outside of Shanghai. I bought, collected fabric from the artists  there, and I   m making clothes out of that fabric right now. It   s the  original blue indigo plant, which actually is a medicine plant in a tribal  way. They used it to heal people. But you can also wear it. A lot of the  clothing I have that I teach in, when I go to teach or for work, is all from  these trips. I have a whole series in my wardrobe of all these indigenous  fabrics. I really enjoy supporting the artists that make the fabric, and I  enjoy designing it and wearing it, and having that exchange with where  I   ve been, giving them what I have, and back and forth.  In 2007, you did an installation for that international art exposition in  Venice called    Most Serene Republics.    Can you talk a bit about the  title, the nature of the project?  I do a lot of research, and I think you have to do that as an artist. You  can   t just be based on your own emotions and desire. You have to go  find out what was there before you came. So, when they asked me to  come to Venice   when I went there, initially, I   d never been to Venice.  18  I   d been to Florence and Rome when I was in London. But my wife,  Shanna Ketchum Heap of Birds, is an art critic and an art historian.  She   s also a Navajo person. She was asked by the Smithsonian to write  an essay about international affiliations in the arts, and she was asked to  attend a conference in Venice, Italy. I just went along as her partner. I  was Mr. Shanna Heap of Birds. I went along, and it was great. She did  her writing, and I kind of just hung out and listened to the speakers. I  knew a lot of  the  people already, but it was actually her initiative that  got me to Venice, it wasn   t mine, and my fame or whatever. I went  along with her, and I learned a lot.  A year later, the same group asked me to come represent the USA and  represent Native America in the Venice Biennale. I made two other trips  to do research before we actually made the piece. So, we were in Italy,  in Venice, meeting the mayor   s professor, the mayor   s architect, going  to the airport and going through security, and looking at  billboard   spaces at Marco Polo International Airport. Going to see the first place,  called a ghetto, which is a term in Italian that refers to making cannon at  a foundry   they closed the foundry down. It   s an island off of Venice,  and they put all the Jewish people there as a concentration camp in  Venice. They made them wear yellow fabric on their clothing, and they  called it a ghetto because it was a cannon factory-making place in  Italian. Of course, ghetto, I use it just talking about Native American  things. It   s part of our speech. So I find those kinds of things out. I  didn   t know ghetto came from this little place on an island where they  put Jewish people, where they make cannons. And I made a panel about  that. I made a piece and put it up by Napoleon   s Garden in Venice.  The    Most Serene Republics    is actually their title for themselves. If you  look back in history, the Venetians are pretty pompous. (Laughter) You  go to Venice, it   s overblown, Elton John lives there. It   s like  this   overblown thing, white man   s palace or whatever. The Basilica of San  Marcos Plaza, the Catholic Church and all that. Anyway, they said they  were such a good society, they were such a good, hospitable, friendly,  elite society. They were the most serene republic, they say. And then I  found that they were what I call the Halliburton of the Crusades, the  facilitators of all the ships that went to kill all the people in the Middle  East. Halliburton is in Oklahoma. Bush   s buddy,  Dick  Cheney, was  president of that company, and they sell all the pizza and water to  the  U.S. troops  in the Middle East wars in  Iraq and  Afghanistan. They got  the contracts to, so it   s all in collusion with making money. It   s not a  holy war. I found that they actually did all that. There was a town called  Zora where the Venetian ships and the big-money people said,    Wow.  We   re into this crusade thing you guys are doing, but we want to get  paid first. We  don   t  know what   s going to happen to you when you go  to Constantinople. Can you go to Zora  first , and rip them off and take  19  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  all their stuff, and bring back the money?    And they did. They went to  Zora and they killed all those people, brought the stuff back, and paid  the benefactors that run Venice. Then went to Constantinople and did  their holy war. And  Ventians  took  people there  in their boats.  So, when all that kind of stuff happens, then they have all these things  they stole and murdered for, in what they call    the treasury,    which is  actually a room inside the Basilica in San Marcos. Like,    Okay, I   m  going to take all the stuff I kill people for and scalped them, I   m going to  put it over here for you to come view.    It was another ten cents to get in  there, by the way, pay to get in. It   s out of this world, the insensitivity.  And it   s celebrated. All the tourists are going,    Oh, look at that beautiful  stuff.    That beautiful stuff was stolen from the Middle East. It   s not  really Venetian stuff. So, anyway, under those circumstances, the Most  Serene Republic, it   s not. (Laughter)  I use it as an irony. Buffalo Bill   s warriors, they were at Wounded Knee,  they were under the gun. They took them out of Pine Ridge, they put  them in a prison outside of Chicago called Fort Sheridan   they built this  prison to actually kill white people that were in unions. They were  worried about union uprisings in Chicago. They put a fort out there  outside of Chicago   they put a whole staff of cavalry there to kill  people if they ever did an uprising with the unions. And they weren   t  uprising, so the cavalry was sort of just hanging out, spinning their  wheels. And so they took the people from Wounded Knee  and Pine  Ridge , put them in that prison, and said,    If you don   t behave  in South  Dakota , we   re going to kill these people here in Fort Sheridan.    Buffalo  Bill runs along,    Hey, you want to go to Europe?       Well, yeah. Get us  out of here. Let   s go. Let   s roll.    He took them, paid a  20,000 rental  fee, paid a brokerage fee to hang onto them. And then people died there.  I documented sixteen deaths, fifteen, sixteen deaths all over Europe. So,  that Most Serene Republic  can be compared  to America, sort of  pompous, fairness and democracy   all this stuff that just is not true, and  so I felt like it was kind of a good kind of pairing.  So it wasn   t a competition, per say, on the part of the National Museum  of the American Indian?  I   m sure internally there was probably some    I was the second  Venice  project done by N.M.A.I. . James Luna was chosen two years before, so  I was the second. No one has been chosen since. I don   t know if that   s  good or bad, but there probably was some kind of internal competition  that happened.  When you   re thinking about an installation like that, and you   re over  there researching, do you take photographs of spaces, or do you just  20  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  kind of carry it in your memory?  I carry it. There   s so many different kinds of variables. We   d have to get  permission from the mayor to do things certain places.  The N.M.A.I.   was very forthcoming with the budget. They bought everything I asked  them to buy. The airport gave me a huge, thirty-foot billboard where   the  customs checkpoint was. I could actually make my message right  there, where it would be scrutinized to  as you entered  the country. An  amazing thing. I thought I couldn   t pull that one off, but we did. So,  anyway, no, I take some video, I have some photographs. But I make  notes and try to diagram a scheme of how to attack the city. Even the  water taxis were a venue for me, some trashcans that they hire out, the  face of the trashcan   we put stuff on there, so we   re all over the city.  The airport, on the gardens, everywhere.  To memorialize the Sioux  lives lost was very important.   Tell me about your studio. How long have you had it?  Okay. Well, I worked for a long time at OU. When I left the  former  Cheyenne-Arapaho  reservation, I got a house in Norman out by the  lake, Lake Thunderbird, and that was great. I had a big cabin. My boys  grew up, running around. They   re used to 500 acres out there  by  Geary    we   ve got like four acres over there, but there was a lot of  woods. OU gives you a space in the art school. They gave me a small  studio. Not small   I had it for a few years. Then I got the big sculpture  in Denver, and I   m working twelve foot tall, fifty foot wide, and so I had  to rent a big space for the sculpture. I made a full-scale model, forty,  fifty foot wide, twelve foot tall, and I rented a big space down by  Bricktown  in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma . Had that for three years, and  that was great to see that I could expand out of the university   s small  little space, and support it with my research, sales, whatever. Then after  that lease ran out, I worked hard at finding another space.  My studio is  now  in the Plaza District in Oklahoma City. I found this building   it  was actually two. Used to be like a bar or something, a pretty derelict  deal. I bought the whole building, and I gutted it and renovated the  whole thing with electricity, plumbing, walls, roof, raised the roof.  Did you do it yourself?  Yes, I designed it, contracted it out, central air and heat, and now you  can   t walk in here  it   s so crowded . (Laughter) I work here, and I store  stuff. I feel strongly about that. I want everyone to know, if you   re an  artist, I want you to be able to put something up and leave it up. Don   t  work, if you can ever help it, taking stuff down, putting it back up     even if it   s a kitchen table, or whatever, just leave it alone, walk in there.  I   ve got all these words written here, about a hundred words. They   re  21  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  going to be some prints I   m doing in Santa Fe in April. They   ve been up  here for two years. These paintings  have  been going for maybe six  months. I get here maybe two hours every couple days, honestly. I don   t  work a lot. I have a family, so all my evenings are with my family.  When I do come here, I   m pretty intense  about  getting some things  done, and they   re just waiting for me. It   s locked up, alarm system, bars  in the door, but I unlock it, walk in here, and within maybe a couple  hours   listen to some sports radio, have my sandwich, I   ll be painting.  I   ll paint for a couple hours, knock off, go back home. So it   s really a  good kind of marriage of lifestyle and having a building. And I own it.  It   s paid for. Insurance is high, but it   s my building, and so it   s great.  People who know anything about Indian history usually have heard of  the Sand Creek Massacre. At the Sand Creek National Historic Site,  there have been some discussions and some action to allow Cheyenne-  Arapaho tribal members more input into the site. Has anyone talked to  you about being involved?  No, I hear about that, but I   ve never been active with that. I have some  of that in my sculpture in Denver. I have a whole tree dedicated to that  history. Also the Washita  massacre site . But I   m very interested in Fort  Marion. I was in Florida this year. My show from Italy went to Florida,  so I went to Fort Marion for the first time. A big part of my history is  about Fort Marion, my  great-great-  grandfather. So that   s one of my  big missions. It   s on the back burner, to do a memorial at Fort Marion. I  think that   s something that   s really needed, a voice down there about the  history that happened in Florida.  Because your grandfather was imprisoned down there.  He died there. He   s buried there.  I see. You judged the youth art show at the Cheyenne-Arapaho complex  at Concho. How much judging do you do, and what kinds of qualities do  you look for in young people   s art?  That was a great gathering of young artists. There was some great flute  playing, too. I   ve been fortunate enough to be able to   I still participate  in the ceremonies as a practitioner. I   m  also  an instructor, but I   ve  actually danced with these kids. They   ve been my colleagues, so I got to  see some of them in that respect, too. I look at traditional learning that  they might be exhibiting, and then some contemporary sensibility. So, it  kind of mirrors, I guess, my  life   s priorities , but I look for both sides of  things. That part of it, in terms of the youth, is the best thing I do, one of  the highest honors I have. I work a lot with the Respect  of the Cheyenne  and Arapaho tribes     program. I   ve been doing youth workshops at  22  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Colony Pow-Wow. I took a group of youth up to the Denver sculpture in  the summer, and we made drawings of my sculpture. Took them to the   Colorado  Rockies baseball game and dinner and it was wonderful. And  they went to Sand Creek on the way back. Now I   m working with elders,  because  the  Respect  program  also serves elders. I did big art  workshops with the elders in Watonga  and Seiling, Oklahoma . I really,  really like working with my tribal people and the youth, particularly.  I know that labels are often misleading, but I think it   s interesting when  people explain why they reject or redefine or even embrace a label.  Would you describe yourself as an artist who happens to be a Cheyenne,  as an Indian artist, as a global cultural worker, or some other way?  The cultural worker is probably pretty appropriate. It depends on what  kind of hat you   re wearing at the moment. I work with kids. I   m going to  Chicago here next month to work with kids. They hired me to go work  with kids   they heard about me, they know what I do. I got a piece in  downtown Chicago in the museum, but I   ll be working with kids. The  thing about that, it   s not a demotion. The problem we have is there   s a  hierarchy, and it   s some kind of exclusive thing. You have very few  famous artists working with kids.    Well why would I ever do that? I   ve  graduated to working with college students.    Well, kids are more  creative than college students,  when  you get to the point of it. You  have more fun. I work with elders, and they surprise me, too. I   m very  happy to work with elders as well. It   s like a mixture of all the things     someone described some of this as a stew. You just have meat and the  potatoes, or whatever. Is that good? Or you want to put some spices in?  Vegetables, some barley in there, some chickpeas. It   s like your diet,  your life wants to be this variety to keep you going. The art world gets  pretty isolated. I enjoy going to the museum, and having cocktails, and  have my work guarded by security guards and a well-lighted space. I do  that often, too, but I think I have more fun working with the elders and  the youth. (Laughter)  What percentage of your work is conceptual art, what percentage is  painting?  A big part of it is public art, I guess. I   m doing a piece in the Virgin  Islands and the Caribbean, a small piece about the tribes that were lost  with Columbus. That   s been overlooked a great deal, where you talk  about Caribbean people and think,    Well, Bob Marley made that place.     Like you think it   s a black   it   s not a black place at all. No. Your  amnesia made it a black place. So, my wife and I are going to go down  there and lecture at the University of the Virgin Islands in San Croix.  And I   m going to make some sign panels to remember the tribes that  came before. That   s a good way to kind of open up the discussion. With  23  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  the public art, I always call it a puncture. It punctures the barrier. It  doesn   t remove the barrier, but it makes a puncture, and then I might  come there and lecture. My wife might  lecture  about some artists in  New Mexico, Arizona. We might have an exhibition. We might meet  some other artists. Usually, it starts brewing this little storm of activity,  and pretty soon, the remembrance is running its own energy. It   s not me  behind it. So, the public art is probably about half of my initiatives,  which happens on the Internet, and corresponding grant proposals. I  have to do a lot of writing. Probably ten percent is the painting, sort of  more solitary. The lights are on, I listen to music, and I   m painting. I do  drawings as well. I do pastel word drawings, and then I do a lot of prints  with text. I   m going to do that in Santa Fe in April, make maybe fifty  new prints. I exhibit those a lot, too. There   s also research travel  involved with all those projects as well. And travel grants to get to the  place, like some of the prints I   ve exhibited in the last couple of years.  Edgar, what is your creative process, from the time you get an idea?  I guess a big part of it is to find the synchronicity. You have an idea, you  have an impulse or desire, but even with all these words I   m working on,  I wait for an intersection of something else   could be historical. It can  be based on politics or human rights or  or sensuality  or love. But it   s  just my own life, and then something intersecting with it, and making  something out of that. I know people who write books or movies have a  notebook, and they   re always attaching things. They   re like a sponge.  They   re soaking up things, and they log them in. Almost all creative  people   even a musician. They   re logging in stuff, and then you go back  to the studio, and you start to weave it together into something else. So,  the logging in is kind of the first impulse. Even with these painting  shapes, I might come in and make four shapes in a day, and leave. And  come back and make four more. I have four paintings going at the same  time, so I work in that kind of sequencing. For me, it   s like the right  accumulation of things. The misnomer is you come up with this brilliant  thing at once. No one ever does. That   s a mistake. You come up with a  piece of it. You get another piece of it, then another piece of it, and it  might take another year. Then, if it is brilliant, it becomes something out  of that. I   ve learned to trust that collecting of impulses. Then, I sweep it  together, making something out of it.  How important is sketching to that process of synchronicity?  Well, it   s real important. It   s like a first reaction. You get that reaction,  and you put it down, and you get another one and another one and  another one. The words I   m talking about, some of these things here,  those are just kind of after thoughts. I have little books that I carry with  me   I buy them at Wal-Mart. They   re spiral notebooks. They   re like  24  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  discussion cards for a lecture, but they   re on a spiral bound thing. I love  that. I write three words on each page, and I fill them up when I   m  traveling. I usually do it when I   m traveling. I do a lot of word things  when I   m traveling on a plane or different experiences. Come back here,  I transcribe them into these bigger sheets, and I re-form them. What they  end up being is monoprints in a print studio, and that could take another  six, nine months. Like I said, I   m going to go to Santa Fe. My favorite  printmaker works out there, a Navajo guy. He   s got a shop right by  Cloud Cliff, downtown. I   ve already booked him for three days. I   m  going to turn up there, and we   re going to get the big roller out and the  paper, and I   ll start painting with the brush, and we   ll start making these  monotypes, which will later become an exhibition, probably,  somewhere. They   ll become an exhibition card. But an experience I had  in Oaxaca, in Cuernavaca, two years ago, might become this print later  on. So, there   s a matter of keeping your life enriching enough to where  you   ve got enough impulses coming in.  A lot of your work draws attention to the forgetting and remembering  that underlies the formation of the present day United States. Why is it  important to make visible history that   s been covered over or  disappeared?  I always talk to my students about  re-examining  things like museums.  They would see a fallacy in a museum, once they understand, an artist  like me or others. They term it revisionist history, but it   s not really a  revision, it   s just the truth. So, they see my work as an editorial. I   m  making an editorial about Abraham Lincoln, but my point is that a  museum   s an editorial. Every exhibit   s an editorial, and they thought it  was some kind of God-founded truth, and nothing is. A book. Here   s a  book. Wow. But that   s an editorial. Someone just said that. It doesn   t  mean it   s true, at all. That   s why it   s important to keep chipping away at  it, adding your take on it, and see what the response is. And maybe get  someone else to add their response to it. And keep the dialogue going so  it   s not a monologue, which books tend to be. I don   t really like books.  (Laughter) I   m a professor, but boy, I don   t want a lot of books around  me. Because first of all, if they   re art  books , they   re about people that  are dead. It   s great you   re here talking to me, but most art people are  talking about people that are dead so they can   t talk back. Almost all  books are written about dead people. People don   t want to write about  live people because they   re too messy. They might come and actually  look,    Can I see what you   re saying?    Art historians hate that. They  don   t want to have anyone talk back to them about anything. They make  some kind of subjective decision or presumption about something. They  want that to be the fact, and it   s just a guess, honestly. Unless you ask  me about it, it   s just a guess. So, it   s great to be able to kind of keep that  flow going of the dialogue, rather than the monologue. And many  25  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  authors and books in libraries and institutions are a monologue. They   re  not really about exchanged information.  Using Native language is an important facet of your work. Can you talk  about that?  Yes, I mean, that   s part of that reclamation, too, using the language that  you   ve had in your culture. But part of it, for me, it   s just a way to  actually get to cozy up to the language. You don   t have an opportunity  to use it often, so how do you use it? Like, my sons and my daughter,  they all have Indian names. They don   t have an English name, and at  least when they use their name, they   re speaking Cheyenne. They   re  speaking Navajo. They have a link with all the sky or with the fire or  being a warrior woman returning home. They have this link with the  story that they have when they get out of bed. When they write out their  social security number and write a check. At least there   s a way to use it,  and be pragmatic about it. With my art, it   s a way for me to learn about  the language, because I don   t know it. I don   t speak it every day. I need  a way to actually engage that linkage. Then also, it   s a way   like, I  spoke Italian in Italy in my work. It   s a way to give credence to where  you are, and to honor where you are. So, part of the pieces in Italy were  in Dakota language, Cheyenne language, English and then Italian, so at  least I was applying it to where I was. I was reasonable to welcome  those people into my work and acknowledge them, rather than saying,     Here is all the Cheyenne, here   s all this English stuff.    Then you close  a door. So it   s good to open the door with language as a way to handle  that.  But the other thing is how Native language just changes the power  dynamic for someone who only speaks English. It   s exactly the position  of Native people first encountering English.  Definitely. I did a big piece in Australia with an Aboriginal artist, a  contemporary Aboriginal artist, and it was about Captain Cook, who  landed at Circular Key Harbor, where the opera house is. That was his  first spot to land, to walk in Australia,  to begin the genocide , and now  it   s a big tourist  location . So, we were in the museum at that place, a  big contemporary art museum. And we get the wall on the first door to  open in that museum, on that piece of land where Captain Cook walked.  And she wanted to make a piece about  it , and we made a very nasty,  horrible thing about Captain Cook. She hates Captain Cook ,which was  fine, and I agree. But she was adamant about not making it in anything  but her language, and she was very articulate in Eora. And we had a  didactic   you could read the translation. But she said,    No, we   re not  going to make any kind of compromise. We   re going to lay down the  words the way those people would have said when he walked up, and  26  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  there   s no English, British, nothing there.    So I laid the Cheyenne down  next to hers, too. So, it can be a stance of power and defiance, language.  You use a lot of signs and maps in your work. How do they help you  communicate?  Well, the signs, in particular, the authoritative nature of signage and  panels, we tend to believe what they say. And it   s a big mistake. People  believe the authoritative voice. Obama comes on TV tonight and says  something.    Hey, wow, we   d better think about that.    Well, no, maybe  not. Maybe he   s just full of it. He   s just another guy. He comes on and  talks about the West. There   s some weird stuff Obama says about the  history and the West and the settlers. He has no affinity with any kind of  non-American, political strife of indigenous people. I never heard  anything   he talks like a regular President Bush to me. I don   t hear   empathy  from him. When he says things, people hear that voice and  they believe it. I want to be that, in the most subversive way. I want to  be the authoritative voice that they think they   re hearing, but I   m  somebody else. (Laughter) I   m the puppeteer behind the curtain. I think  we   ve made a lot of good progress. And we   ve confused people, too.  The point about that museum exhibit I talked to the students about is  maybe you should question  every  exhibit you see. That   s a point.  Here   s a sign, here   s a historical marker. You   re driving down the road,  pull over, look at it. Maybe you should think,    Is that true?    You see one  of mine   you know mine has  an  editorial background. It   s got a point  of view that   s tilted. Well, so does that  official  one. Maybe the other  ones do, too, down the road, and so does that other one. If you can start  to question the authority that   s talking to you, you might be better off.  The US is finally getting behind some of the UN resolutions to protect  culture, languages, arts, land bases of indigenous people. Do you think  this shift not only comes from, maybe, a shift in administration, but also  from the work that artists have been doing, indigenous artists?  I think it can help, particularly if you have a political, hard edge to what  you   re saying. Because often, books and things take so much time, and  so much money behind them to get the idea out, but an artist can have an  idea today and make it tomorrow or make it tonight. We   re pretty quick  and very effective. I was in China the other day, in Beijing, and I gave  an address to the University of Beijing. I  had done  a piece in    89 about  Tiananmen Square, had a show of it in Hong Kong, and I pulled that out.  We actually had it sent on Internet all the way to China the day of my  lecture. It came through my computer like ten minutes before my lecture  was going to happen. It   s a very simple piece, about a four foot print,  and it just says,    Don   t Believe Miss Liberty.    So, I was at Tiananmen  27  Little Thunder  Square looking at where they killed these kids, where the tanks pulled  out, but also where they pulled out that Statue of Liberty that they made.  They called it Goddess of Liberty. And they said,    Here   s our future.    I  told the students,    Remember, the Statue of Liberty has her back to all  the Indians. It faces to welcome everybody in New York Harbor. Its  back is to all the Indians.    So if you bring that to me, I don   t trust her. I  don   t want to talk to her. She   s welcoming everyone to come to Indian  land  , giving it away . Our lands are open to you. Well, not to the  Indians, they   re not open. No one asked us about that, see? So, here the  Chinese students are being idealistic and saying,    We want that.    And  I   m thinking,    Do you? Do you really want  Miss Liberty ?     And look what   s happened now. China is like the Champs Elysees     Maseratis, Ferrari cars, miniskirts and iPods. It   s humming. I was just  shocked. It   s more modern than New York City. It   s way off the charts.  And the pollution is as high, too, in the industrial zones. It   s got this very  weird thing happening with the US economy regulating our air, and then  we buy all the stuff that   s fouled up  the  air in China and bring it to  Wal-Mart, and we use it. We tell them,     China,  you should clean your  air up,    and  China is living with  dirt  in the air  for you to wear this  shirt. The hypocrisy is just out of this world when you go see the places  and see where it comes from. America has all kinds of problems with the  money part that drives all these other economies. Plus, we   re all broke,  and we   re borrowing our money from China. We have no money. We   re  buying all our capital from China, because they   re making all the Wal-  Mart junk, so the economy   I   m thinking about that a lot, the dollar, and  parity with economies and land and so on.  Artists can cut right to the chase. I can say,    Don   t believe Miss  Liberty.    I   m in China, that   s what I told them  and show my print . I  went to Shanghai and said the same thing. Before you get on that boat,  see where that boat   s been. See how it   s treated. They have, like, a  thousand ethnic minorities in  various  parts of China   tens of  thousands there, all over China. You can actually have  multiple   children in those cultures. You can have  only  one child in China.  Those ethnic minorities aren   t China, they   re reservations. They can  have ten kids. They have their own rights, they have their own laws. But  everyone in China has to only have one kid. Have an abortion or they  kill the other kids. So it   s like,    Wow, that   s amazing.    How can you  have sensitivity enough to handle all that? What do they think about  that   regular Chinese society? When  ethnic minorities  can have all  these children they can   t have? Like America, the discrepancy is huge.  It   ll be interesting to see what happens in China in the years to come.  (Laughter)  You   re doing a lot of work with Cheyenne/Arapaho tribal members. Do  28  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  you feel like your work is as accessible or well known as it should be in  C A country?  No, no. I think it takes that kind of hands-on stuff to get that way. What  I   ve been surprised about is how receptive everybody is. They   re like  really, really interested, and really not resistant. There   s a way I teach, I  teach it like,    Here it is.    When I do a workshop with elders, say, I give  them all sweet grass and deer tails  , ceremonial items to use . And I  come in,    Okay. Here   s the art deal, here   s this and that, but here   s what  you really need. When we get done, here   s fifty deer tails   and I bought  them myself   and thirty hanks of sweet grass.    We   re working, and  these dudes are like,    Hey, are the sweet grass ready?       No, no, no.    I  know who they are, they   re instructors   they want their stuff. So, in that  way, I come on like a real   I am a real person in their society and their  learning. So, when I do something else, well, that   s just what Edgar  does, so yeah. (Laughter)  What is your goal in re-educating the dominant society? You want that  puncture that political art can do, so  people  get angry and the  dialogue starts?  Yes, and it becomes noteworthy. It becomes a news article. It gets put on  the table. That   s what happens. So, when the puncture occurs, it  becomes inflammatory. One thing I really would like to do is to take that  Cowboy  Pistol Pete  in Stillwater and put his face on Eskimo Joe.  That   s my next project. Eskimo Joe is a horrible thing, and the Cowboy  is   they ought to get together, and see who doesn   t like what. What you  need to do is take their things and mess with their  images . Don   t worry  about your stuff, our stuff   s fine. Go get in their junk and stir that stuff  up. And they   ll think,    Ooh, I don   t like someone messing with my           Well, we don   t want anyone messing with our stuff, either. How does it  feel?    That   s something that needs to happen, and then we   ll raise  awareness from that perspective.  Looking back on your career, what was a pivotal point for you?.  Well, the Times Square piece, and then coming back to Oklahoma. I  could have been a New York artist all day long, and lived with all my  colleagues and taught in art school, but I came back and learned about  the ceremonies and lived on that canyon. And I still went back and  taught in the art schools. I still go to New York   I   m known in New  York. I do a lot of work in L.A., a lot of work in California. I have three  projects going on in California right now, but I live in Oklahoma.  Sometimes I come to  New York City  and people say,    How long have  you lived here?    I never lived in New York. They think I live downtown  somewhere, but I never did. I   ve been living here since 1982. I   m in  29  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Australia quite a lot, Africa, I   m in Asia, but you can make this work. I  think you have to get out, that   s the thing. These paintings I   m working  on now, I   m thinking about doing some seasons, maybe. It   s number  four, there   s four seasons, and so I limit myself to blues   that could be  about the spring, and the green. Then I could do another series that could  be the reds of the fall, I could do another series with white. I was at the  Metropolitan Museum of Art a couple years ago. I go over there a lot  when I go to town. I saw Monet painted the Seine, one day, in a snow  storm. And it   s the most beautiful painting. I sat and looked at that for  about twenty minutes, and it   s all white. It   s just white.    This man  painted a white painting with white. With different colors of white.    It   s  just astounding to see that pulled off. I want to make a white painting,  and make a series of white paintings   like there   s ice and snow today. I  enjoy pursing that, but again, I   ve got to go to New York City to see that  Monet. I can   t sit here in Oklahoma. I mean, Monet comes once in a  while, but you   ve got to move around. I think  that way  you can stay  here. This building I bought is super cheap on the market of the world.  My house is, too. Oklahoma   s a very inexpensive place to live and with  the money you save, you should get on the road and see what   s going on  in the world, and come back and work on your studio practice, and share  it with people in your community.  What has been one of the highlights of your career?  I suppose being able to take your family with you. It   s something I   m  committed to. I took my sons all over to Africa, to Australia, my  younger boy and I went to Thailand together, snorkeled off Koh Samui  together. My daughter   she   s twenty months old, she   s already been to  L.A. twice, New York City, Cancun twice, Chichen Itza. We   re going to  go to the Virgin Islands in a couple months, and Arizona, back and forth  to the Navajo reservation. I think if you can be with your community, or  your own personal family part of it, and then move. It   s not easy, and I  don   t  always  have a good time. I took my daughter to New York, had  to carry her up and down the stairs of the subway all weekend. I got tired  and I didn   t enjoy that. But we were together at Times Square, rolling  around, laughing  in Central Park . We have a little movie we made  together. My mom and dad came to the inauguration of my sculpture in  Denver, we drove up there together. They   re there, and they   re on the   museum   s dvd  I made together. So probably having that privilege to  share that with your family, keeping you together and growing together  that way is probably the highlight of it all.  How about one of the low points?  Low points? Well, being an artist in the contemporary world is about  travel. One of my buddies, he   s really famous, he   s out of Napa Valley,  30  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  a professor in San Francisco. We interviewed him for my classes this  semester   one of my students interviewed him. They said,    What about  being a famous artist?    He said,    Well, that   s like living in hotels and  airplanes, and I don   t want to do that.    He just got back from Sweden.  He   s like, giving a disclaimer, but he   s not out like I am, that   s true.  Today, to be an internationally known artist, and to be practicing in the  world, that   s kind of your template. Your palette is the world. You have  to be having a lot of jet miles. I have a lot of miles on American  Airlines. I   m a gold member. I fly many, many miles and hotels   it   s  that kind of loneliness. You   re by yourself again. You   re in a wonderful  place. By yourself. Again.  How long can I do that? I don   t know. It seems to be important to get  things done. If you don   t go, you can   t make it happen. If I didn   t go to  Australia and meet that woman that wanted to set up that Captain Cook  piece, and have her defiantly want to speak in her own language, and go  to the reservation and see how bad they live, I can   t do that on Discovery  Channel or Internet surfing. I have to go and sit with those people at the  fire and see and be there in the hot sun, for me to get a clear vision, or as  clear as I can. So, I have to be on the ground there, too. That   s the hard  part, that   s kind of a solo thing. I went to Zimbabwe, like I said. At that  time they were almost having a war. I took my family the next year to go  to the game park. We lived in a tree house and saw a rhino and elephants  and lion, but I went first to see if it was safe to go. I   ve been in Belfast  working, too, but I don   t think I would take my family to Belfast, per se,  but I went to Belfast. I think it takes that kind of hands-on experience to  learn about it, but it   s not always pleasant.  Is it possible to be an activist artist working within an educational  institution?  I think so. I   ve learned something pretty curious. I   ve found that you   re  actually better off outside of the art school paradigm, rubric.  Art  schools and art departments are  more conservative, oddly enough. The  Arts and Sciences  department  is more free than the Art  department .  The art is bound by so many limitations. You   d think Art is like open,  free, do what you want, but it   s really not. But  the  Humanities is   about  anything you can think of. You can have a course on gender,  homosexuality, any kind of thing you can think of. You can have a  course about it in the Humanities, and write a book about it and read  books about it. So, I   ve totally changed my appointment to be only in the  Humanities. I can be an activist artist in the Humanities, oddly enough.  But you almost have to be in your own niche, too. So, that may be  helping me where I am as well. Art is competitive and your peers   if  you set the bar real high, you get a lot of flak. And I don   t slow down at  all, my resume is like  fifty  pages long, and I add three pages a year to  31  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  it, or more. So, if you have one exhibition, and I   ve got ten or  something, then people will argue about all that. I don   t like that. I   d  rather just keep moving ahead and get the support to do that.  Is there anything you   d like to add or we   ve forgotten to mention before  we take a look at your work?  Just that the community is really important, and the youth is really  important and the elders. And making your own priorities about what   s  important to your own people, locally. That   s the real challenge. Even  the University has their own agenda. They look at all my activism on the  reservation, they say,    Yeah, but why do we want to do that? Is that  what you   re really supposed to be doing? I wish you   d be doing that here  in this building  , university community .    Well, it   s Native Studies,  right? All these Native people are over here. You   re always kind of  pushing at the edges of how they define you, and they don   t really like  this, they don   t like that, so it   s good to kind of fill the cup to the edges,  if you can.  Well, let   s take a look at some of your work.  Okay. We   re looking at the neuf series paintings, and the main thing to  consider here is that they   re in progress, so they   re going to fill up.  You   ll probably see one a bit later that   s done. But these are maybe one-third  finished. They   re all shapes that came out of the juniper trees from  the reservation west of Geary, in my ten years living out there, kind of as  a symbol. Sketchy, kind of barbed type tree, and later, it became an  image from the fish and the Great Barrier Reef fish. Then later, they sort  of got fused together as this pattern moving across, like maybe a bank of  clouds blowing by or something. I   m going to go back to the Virgin  Islands in March and swim some more with the fish and kind of renew  my time there again with the tropical fish. So there are four in the neuf.   You   re supposed  to do something four times in the Cheyenne  language. So, there   s four paintings I do each time, and they get as big as  ten feet. These are some small ones that I   m working on  and will be  exhibited in a museum in Los Angeles .  These are   at one point, they were called    wall lyrics.    They   re three-word  phrases that go together.    Touch Hard Watch    is one.    Wire Tree  Rings    is another. They   re chosen in some ways because of sound, but  also, they   re autobiographical sketches from an incident that might have  happened to me. Sometimes they   re actually combinations of two or  three actions. What I do with them is I notate them in those small little  booklets, and I bring them back here and I make these  drawings . These  are all vellum. I like this vellum paper. There   s another step, later, where  I take two sheets and make one message. Then I create a monotype in  32  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  printmaking with color.  It   s  a very kind of haphazard print-making  process, open print-making process, so they   re probably  the  epitome of  a personal message, a personal transcription of something happening.  They   re also in a code. I   ve developed a code to write in, so no one  really knows exactly what I   m talking about, unless you were there. It   s  a game I play with myself and the viewer, a kind of perverse game  where you make this very personal, personal coded secret message, and  then you show it publicly. It becomes public. It   ll be in the  invitation   cards, it   ll be in the newspaper, it   ll be exhibited at museums. And  you   ve got this kind of perverse secret about it. I   m very into it. I   ve  been doing it for ten years. One level, people look at it and say,    Well,  that   s interesting in terms of your political art. That   s kind of clear and  cutting-edge.    Or,    Your paintings are beautiful, lyrical, and then these  are kind of sexy, creepy kind of secret things.    It   s true. You have to be  all kinds of people to be yourself. You can   t be one. That flies in the face  of another archetype that   s wrong, that there   s a master work, there   s  one image, just one kind of style artists create. They   re forced to do that   for this market , but I don   t accept it myself. But, then, no one wants to  buy my work because what do I buy? The words, the paintings, the  public art?    I   m confus ing to an art  collector, so I won   t buy  anything.    I understand that. But this, what it tends to do for me is the  real frontier, in a sense. What describes you. Art should describe you,  the artist. That   s what it does. It   s not  just  for sale. So, when you do all  this stuff together, it tends to describe me pretty good.  Then everybody else brings their own associations with it, and the  context in which they see it becomes part of the whole thing?  Yes, sure, and I really like that, too. That   s what everything should be  like. Everyone brings their own interpretation to whatever it is we make.  Here   s the card book. This is the one from China. These are all things  that came from China.  This is one of the full scale models for  Medicine  Wheel, the sculpture  in Denver. It   s a tree. At the top it says,    Free    and that   s Leonard  Peltier   s ID number at Leavenworth Penitentiary, so  it   s  talking about  free the Sun. Many Magpies is my Cheyenne name   Heap of Birds. So,  those are Magpies, which were actually drawn at Fort Marion prison   one hundred years ago , and I enlarged them. A warrior made those  drawings of magpie birds. Then it shows the tribes of 2000. One side of  the tree shows the population growth, and on the other side, the  opposing side,  it  was a smaller   after the massacres the tribes were  smaller. This side shows that they grew in time. So I made full-scale  models, and we traced off of them to make the porcelain and steel prints  on the sculpture in Denver.  33  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  Little Thunder  Heap of Birds  They   re a beautiful red color.  Red steel porcelain. These were shown in New York City at the National  Museum of the American Indian. We had a solo exhibition of the trees  with some of my big drawings of words. The ones that are wrapped up  were in New York City, actually, so your studio is like a big storage  space, too. You work around the storage, basically.  Thank you very much for your time, Edgar.  I look forward to all the other artists, too, and seeing their interviews, as  well.  ------  ------
