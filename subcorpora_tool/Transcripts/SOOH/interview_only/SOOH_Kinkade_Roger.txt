 Myers, and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is April 13, 2012, and I   m in Kellyville, Oklahoma  meeting at the home of Roger Kinkade. I   ll be interviewing Roger today  as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Thank you for meeting with  me here today, Roger. Would you tell me a little bit about your family  and what your childhood was like, growing up? It wasn   t here in  Oklahoma, right?  No, it was in Iowa. I was born and raised on a farm in Iowa. I was born  during the Depression, and everybody pretty well knows what life was  like after the Depression, pretty skimpy. (Laughs) I didn   t much like  school. My second year of high school, I decided to join the service. I  wanted to go in during World War II, but I was way too young. So, I  made up my mind, I would go after the war. I enlisted in the navy. I had  my dad sign for me. I was seventeen. Went to take my physical and they  turned me down for flat feet. So, I went home, pouting, didn   t know  what to do. I worked on the farm for a year and went to see my brother  in Waterloo, which is a bigger town than where I was raised. I happened  to walk by a marine corps recruiting station and them blues sold me. I  enlisted. (Laughter)  So the dress blues got you.  Yes, the dress blues got me. I enlisted in the marine corps and went to  San Diego for basic training. I got out of basic training. I went to Camp  Pendleton. I was in 4.2 mortars for, oh, about six months, and I got  orders to take a twenty day leave and report back to Treasure Island in  San Francisco. I didn   t know where I was going from there. Stayed there  for about a week or two until they got a shipload. The day we were  shipping out from Treasure Island, the war broke out in Korea. I was  detoured.  5  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Yes, I   ll say. What year was it you went to boot camp there at   you said  that was at San Diego?  Yes. August of    49.  Did you know ahead of time what you were going to do, as far as being  in four-deuce  4.2 , in mortars?  No. Of course, they put you through all kinds of interviews and stuff  when you go into boot camp. They asked me what I wanted to do, what  occupation I wanted, and I told them I wanted motor transport or  artillery. Well, they naturally give me an 0800 MOS  Military  Occupation Specialty  out of boot camp, which is artillery. But I went to  4.2 mortars instead. I guess they figured that was artillery at the time.  (Laughter) But when I got to Korea, I was in the artillery then.  I see. So you went from San Diego to Pendleton to train on that?  Yes.  How long did that training last there at Pendleton?  I guess it would have been indefinite, but they picked a certain few to  send overseas. I figured I was headed for Guam. I didn   t know, I wasn   t  told, but I ended up in Korea.  So your total training for boot camp and then for training on mortars,  how much time was that, roughly?  It was from August of    49 to April of    50.  I know just from my own research, the run-up to the Korean war, the US  military had been kind of drawn down quite a bit.  Oh, definitely. Drastically, yes.  Drastically. How so? How was it in the service at that time while it was  being drawn down?  It was relaxed. Nobody thought of a war or that we needed combat  training or anything. We were getting combat training, but not strict  enough combat training. We were undersized, undermanned. We went to  Korea and there was so many of us had never seen combat. We were     oh, they was just kicking our ass badly because we were undermanned  and undertrained. But we fought our way out of it and come out on top, I  6  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  guess you   d say.  Yes. So if everything was drawn down, was there a shortage of  equipment or anything like that?  Definitely a shortage of equipment.  That was while you were still in the States or just while you were in  Korea?  Both.  Both. What kinds of things were you missing that you really needed?  Guns and clothing.  Just like winter gear, that sort of thing?  Winter gear especially, yes.  As far as guns, you   re talking about the carbine or the M1, or   ?  No, we had M1s and carbines, but 105s.  Oh, you   re talking about the heavy weapons.  The heavy weapons. We had leftover World War II weapons. I guess I  shouldn   t complain. They got us by, but it would have been better to  have newer ones.  So you were eighteen when you enlisted in the marines. Do you  remember anything about your instructors going through boot camp?  Yes. Our senior drill instructor was Corporal Schauer. He had been in  World War II. He was, well I thought, real strict. But he was good. He  brought us through, all of us acting like one, like we were supposed to.  Sure. Do you remember some of the men that you served with there?  Were they the same ones that went with you to Korea?  There were three of us that went to Camp Pendleton, but then I didn   t  see anybody I knew after that.  Okay. Everyone was classed into their MOS and went in different  directions?  7  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Yes.  I see. You went to Treasure Island to prepare to move overseas.  Yes.  What month was that? That was  May  of 1950?  No, that was  May  of 1950.  Okay.  May  of 1950. So you were at Treasure Island on June of 1950  and you get orders to head to Japan? Is that correct?  I had no idea where I was going. We just boarded the ship and then the  war broke out in Korea. So, they detoured. Wherever I was headed for,  we went to Pearl Harbor. In Pearl Harbor, we drew weapons and  prepared for combat, stored all of our gear except our combat gear,  clothing and everything. They issued us cosmoline rifles. We cleaned  up, got ready to go     Right out of the cases.   No, out of storage .   Used , okay.  And then we flew on a Pan-American Stratocruiser to Japan.  No kidding? That was from Hawaii? Flew from Hawaii to Japan?  Yes. And then we took a train the full length of Japan and took a  Japanese boat to Pusan, Korea. And from Pusan, we took a train up to  the front lines.  Okay, so you came in way down south?  Yes. I was with the First Marine Brigade around the Pusan Perimeter  when we almost lost Korea completely.  That   s when Seoul was attacked, is that correct?  Yes, the North Koreans had all of Korea, but a little corner of the Pusan  Perimeter. During the time we were fighting on the lines, they were  getting more replacements in all the time. Finally, they got enough to  make a short division. That   s when we withdrew off the lines and  boarded ships and made the Inchon landing.  8  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Let   s back up just a bit and talk about that, the Pusan Perimeter. When  you arrived there, was there any specific landing or anything like that?  Or was it just boating over to the Korean coast, there?  Just boated us over to the Pusan Harbor.  Okay, and then everyone expelled into Pusan and took up positions?  Yes. The Nakdong River kind of makes a U-shape north of Pusan. That  was more or less the border for the Pusan Perimeter. Masan was over on  the west side of the Pusan Perimeter. That   s where the heaviest fighting  was. That   s where we were when we withdrew to make the Inchon  landing.  Okay. For those who don   t know, Pusan is pretty much at the  southernmost point of Korea.  That   s the southern port of Korea.  So you pulled out of Pusan about what date?  I think it was September 12th, I believe. We made the landing the  fifteenth. I think it was the twelfth that we pulled out of  Pusan Harbor .  So that was part of McArthur   s left hook into Inchon.  Yes.  How was that landing at Inchon and the days that followed after that?  It was kind of rough, but it could have been rougher.  Okay. How was it rough?  Well, first of all, we had that wall to go over right on shore.  That was the seawall.  Yes, that seawall. Up until that time, I had not seen any dead marines.  Just before we got into Seoul, we were moving up on the lines and I seen  three tarp-covered bodies laying alongside the road and that just made  your blood run cold. You just wanted to go after them hot and heavy.  But then after we took Seoul, worked north a little, the army division  come in and relieved us. We went back aboard ship and went all the way  around Korea to Wonsan.  9  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  That was the right hook, into Wonsan.  Yes. We got there and the harbor was full of mines. We floated for two  weeks out on the sea until they got the harbor cleared. Then we made the  landing at Wonsan, and Bob Hope had left the day before. (Laughter) It  was kind of comical in a way.  So how was that, waiting to get into the harbor, there? Did you have any  problems with supplies?  Yes. We didn   t have no food. All we had was boiled rice, three times a  day.  Good grief. I   m sure you probably had some food when you got there.  How soon after you go there did you have to switch to that boiled rice,  or was that from the get-go?  It was, say, three or four days before we run out and had to go on rice.  So a week and a half, pretty much, on boiled rice. How did that affect  the soldiers going on boiled rice like that?  It didn   t affect me, but we had a lot of dysentery while we were out  there. I don   t know how I escaped it, but  I did .  Was that mostly just from the rice, from the food, or?  I have no idea what caused it. I wouldn   t imagine boiled rice would have  did it, but     You never know. (Laughs)  Never know.  So while you   re out there, I   m sure you guys weren   t sleeping in the rack  or anything like that. What did you do on the boat while you were  waiting for the Wonsan Harbor, there?  Well, mainly, we were watching over the bow of the ship for mines.  Oh, I see.  It was just casual, fighting seasickness and hunger.  So once the harbor was cleared and the boat was able to dock, were you  10  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  over the side on the nets, or   ?  No. I did have that experience when we made a mock landing before the  Korean War broke out. While I was at Camp Pendleton, we made a  mock landing and I had to experience going over the net. But no, we  were in amphibious DUKW  called a    duck    . We had our 105 and our  crew in a DUKW. We were in an LST  Landing Ship Tank , and this  LST opened its gates and we paddled out on a DUKW.  Drove up on the shore?  Yes. Funny thing happened, though, while we were going to shore.  These LCVP  Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel , you know what that  is?  If you   ll tell us, that   d be great.  It   s the navy   s landing craft personnel. It   s quite a bit bigger than a  DUKW. Here come one barreling down on us and it hit us broadside.  (Laughter) Most of the crew got dunked and it caved in the side of the  DUKW. We had to get it pulled out, to get our gun out, after we got  ashore.  So you didn   t experience any resistance or anything like that pulling up  into Wonsan?  No, there was no resistance there at that time.  Okay. How long would you say you were in Wonsan, there?  Oh, we was just there a matter of a couple days and then we started for  the mountains then.  Okay. As far as the heading forward, what can you tell me about your  unit, with your 105 team, with your howitzer crew?  It was rather pleasant. We learned to work together. It was rather  pleasant. I hadn   t had any training on a 105 before I got there, but I  picked it up. And my section leader, he took me under his arm and  guided me through it. I ended up being a gunner on a 105.  I   ll be. So do you remember some of the men you served with there on  the 105?  I remember a couple, yes.  11  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Who were those folks?  Corporal Riddle, he was the section leader. When he rotated back, there  was a Corporal Hill that took over. That   s about all I remember of the  names. I can visualize the others.  So when you headed out from Wonsan, what was the game plan heading  north?  The Yalu River.  Yalu River, okay. What was the big push there, as far as heading toward  the Yalu River? That was to get the North Koreans out?  Yes, it was to secure Korea, period. We had no idea the Chinese were  there. We had Tenth Corps and X Corps. Tenth Corps was on the west  and X Corps was on the east. We were in X Corps. We were just  pushing to northern Korea, to the Yalu River. We got as far as the  Chosin Reservoir. That   s when we got hit with the Chinese.  Where did your 105 crew end up at? Where did you set up at for that  battle?  Well, the battalion I was in, we were up at Yudam-ni. That was as far  north as we had gotten. Then we had to start fighting our way back.  As far as Yudam-ni, where is that? That   s on the western edge?  West side of the reservoir.  West side of the reservoir, so you   d set up at Yudam-ni     When we first went up, we were on the east side. The army, I forget  what unit of the army, come up and relieved us. We went around to the  west side then.  So you were at Hagaru, or   ?  Yes.  Do you remember about what date it was that you showed up at  Hagaru?  I distinctly remember the day when we was coming back. It was the  fourth of December. I got shot and got evacuated there.  12  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  And that was after   so you were coming back from   ?  Yudam-ni.  Okay, you were coming back from Yudam-ni and got to Hagaru and got  shot, okay.  Yes.  Let   s go back to Yudam-ni. When did you show up there? What date do  you think it was that you showed up there?  I think it was the twenty-seventh or eighth of November, somewhere in  there.  Okay, so the battle there, in and around the reservoir, had already  kicked off at that point in time?  Yes.  Were you fighting your way up to that point, to actually set up the guns?  No, we weren   t fighting up to that point. It was when we got there that  they hit us, hit every unit of the First Marine Division.  So that was on the twenty-seventh of November?  Yes, there were skirmishes before that, but not with my unit.  Okay, so your unit ran into its first skirmish on the twenty-seventh.  That was around the twenty-seventh, yes.  How did that kick off? How did that start? Can you kind of detail that  first skirmish?  Well, I guess the first   there were rumors that we were surrounded with  Chinese. This was in the evening, I will guess, of the twenty-sixth. And  the morning of the twenty-seventh, we had squad tents, we were relaxed.  We had latrines. We   d get up in the morning and have to go to the  latrine. Well, you just step foot out of that tent and you got more damn  rifle shots    It was just screaming with bullets. In the tent, they couldn   t  see us, but our tent was full of holes. But we stayed down. You look out  and up on the hill, you can just see. They look like ants up there. So we  proceeded to burn everything but what we could carry. I guess you could  kind of say we regrouped and started figuring our way to go back.  13  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Okay. Tell me why you burned everything. Was there more than one  reason?  Well, the biggest reason was to lighten our load.  Do you think maybe some concealment, a little bit of smoke concealment  to cover like your     No, that wasn   t a  reason .  That wasn   t a reason at all?  No.  Okay, just so that it was a lighter load and you weren   t leaving it behind  for the  enemy .  Yes, we destroyed everything that wouldn   t burn and that we left behind.  So that was the morning of the twenty-seventh.  I   m guessing it was the twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth, something like  that.  So early morning hours, like six o   clock in the morning?  Yes, break of day.  Break of dawn, okay. So that was at Yudam-ni. So you pull back from  Yudam-ni. Where is the next place your crew sets up at?  Well, we really didn   t set up. We just followed that  mountain  trail back  to Hagaru.  Back to Hagaru.  It was a long convoy. Of course, there were skirmishes, but it was more  with the infantry than it was with the artillery. There was a   I forget  what hill it was, but they called it Fox Hill. It   s where Fox Company  almost got annihilated. When we got there, there were breaks in the  convoy, gaps, for some reason. I don   t know what the reason. The truck  I was on got stalled and the convoy went on. When it got night, it was so  snowy and frosty that the driver couldn   t see the trail going down the  mountains. Somebody had to walk in front of the truck and guide it so  we all voted to take two hour shifts, walking.  14  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  I took the first shift from ten to twelve. I woke up a section leader. He  was supposed to relieve me. I woke him up and he says,    Yes, I   ll get  up. Go ahead and get in your bag.    So I got in my sleeping bag, and he  didn   t get up. The battery gunnery sergeant was riding in the truck with  the driver and Rip was the driver and he said,    I can   t see the road. I   ve  got to have somebody leading me.    So, the gunny says,    Get Kinkade  up.    I don   t know if he had it in for me or if he didn   t know I had just  walked or what, but I walked the rest of the night down the  mountain   until we hit a roadblock. I was so cold, my joints were stiff. I could  hardly walk so I crawled in my sleeping bag.  We had to turn in our M1s to go to the infantry, and they gave us  carbines back. Well, carbines weren   t much count for distance. But  before I got in my sleeping bag, up on the hill, you could see them up  there sighting mortars in on us. But like I say, I was so cold, I didn   t  much care. I just wanted to get comfortable. I got in my bag and then the  gunny hollered,    Everybody off the truck.    Well, then we moved in  jerks going across this roadblock. There was kind of an embankment  there where we run alongside the truck.  I looked off across and I could see our battery warrant officer had turned  a 105 around and he was trying to get a crew to fire into these Chinese.  So, I took off running. They had a bunch of CATs and 155s sitting there  that they had to destroy because they run out of fuel. I run toward them  and just before I got there, that   s when I got shot. I hollered at the  gunner and told him I was hit and he motioned me on. I started running  up the road, and I passed out. When I come to, there was a couple guys  putting me on a six-by and a corpsmen there giving me some morphine  and putting field dressing on me. I rode the truck. It was about four or  five miles into Hagaru. Then they put me on a plane and evacuated me.  Where were you hit at?  Pardon?  When you were shot, where were you hit at?  In the shoulder, right shoulder.  Okay. Just a single round, I   m sure.  Yes. While I was running, at one time, I looked down and you could see  a machine gun, they was trying to get a machine gun. They must have  run out of ammo or a gun jam, which I was thankful for. I just got a rifle  shot.  15  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  They were trying to walk it in on you.  Yes.  Okay. So you were   from Hagaru, you were sent back to a MASH   Mobile Army Surgical Hospital  unit there? Is that right?  Yes, I went to a MASH unit and they sent me to Tokyo. Then I ended up  at the Yokosuka Naval Hospital in Japan.  As far as any kind of firing, setting up and firing the 105, did your crew  get an opportunity to do that? When you guys showed up at Yudam-ni,  when you were there, how many rounds do you think your crew shot?  Oh, man, a bunch. Well, we fired what we had. Of course, the air force  was dropping supplies in and we were using them up as fast as they  dropped them in on us.  Just your best guesstimate, how many rounds do you think you went  through just there at Yudam-ni?  Oh, gosh, a hundred or more  at each gun .  One hundred, or more, 105 rounds. Do you remember, just off the top of  your head, what like the blast radius is on a 105 when it impacts? Was it  mostly   well, it just would have been HE.  Yes, we had HE, and I forget now what all they called them. We had  timed noses armor.  Time-fuse.  Yes, so many seconds. We had some of them.  So you can get an air burst-type of explosion instead of a ground burst.  We carried shot shells. That   s what the warrant officer was going to fire  into that roadblock was some shot shells.  Explain for us what a shot shell is.  Well, it   s kind of like a shotgun shell, point-blank. You don   t aim. You  just   bore sight and fire point-blank.  So it   s full of pellets.  16  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Yes.  So it   s a big shotgun shell, essentially.  Yes.  He was just going to blow a hole in the        in the Chinese.  That was at the roadblock there. Blow a big hole in the roadblock and  keep on driving.  Yes. We had a lot of roadblocks coming down, but that one was the  worst for my unit getting through.  How long did it take to get through that particular roadblock?  Well, they hit us at dawn. I don   t know, I guess it   s safe to say by ten or  eleven, we were through it. Maybe it was longer than that. Of course, I  was out of it by then, too.  So about what time was it in the morning, then, that you   d gotten shot,  just roughly?  I   m guessing it was probably seven, somewhere around there.  Okay. So you   re getting checked out by the corpsmen and then you   re off  to the MASH unit. How long were you there?  Well, it   s just like MASH TV show. You come in on a helicopter, they  lay you out on the ground, and the doctor comes along and says,     Surgery or on further?    I was laying there and he come looked at me  and said,    Tokyo.    So, it was a matter of an hour, I guess, and I was on  the plane again.  I   ll be. I can   t remember the term they have for that, where they   re  seeing if you need immediate help or determining if you need to go right  to surgery or on.  Well, they check your wound and see how bad it was and then make  snap decisions from that.  So then you   re off headed towards Tokyo. How long were you in Tokyo?  17  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Just long enough to get on a truck and go to the Yokosuka Hospital.  So Yokosuka, you go in, you   re in surgery for     No, I didn   t go to surgery. My whole upper torso, front and back, was  covered with caked blood. They cut my clothes off of me and put me on  a bunk. Of course, I was tired enough. I fell asleep. (Laughter)  So they put you in a bunk, you   re passed out asleep. They didn   t do any  kind of surgery or anything. It was a clean shot through?  Yes. They just changed dressings and     Stitched you up a little bit and changed dressings, or let it heal out?  I was there from the fourth of December until the twentieth of January.  It must have hit a large artery or vein or something with how much  blood I lost. I got down to 130 pounds.  From where? What did you weigh before?  About 165.  Oh, so thirty-five pounds in about a month and a half, two months  almost. My goodness.  Of course, they were short on blood and I didn   t get a transfusion or  nothing. It was still mighty sore when I went back to Korea, too.  So you head back to Korea on the 20th of January?  Yes.  Where did you go from there?  Back to my old unit.  Where were they at at that time?  It was in the center, about the center of Korea. It was getting ready to  start the Spring Offensive. I don   t remember the name of the town it was  near or anything.  Okay. Let   s go back to just talk about Yudam-ni a little bit more or just  any kinds of experiences there. Is there anything that just kind of comes  to memory? Just really vivid memories from that time there at Chosin?  18  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Well, like I say, we couldn   t get out of our tents without getting shot at.  You look up on the hill and you see them, look like ants up there. At  night, that   s when they did their attacks, mostly at night. You didn   t get  no sleep. We always had fire missions. I was gunner on our gun, and  they took a lot of the ammo bearers and sent them up to the infantry  because they were losing so many men. That   s about all I can remember  other than the starting and stopping going down that mountain. One  time, we had just rounded a bend. Of course, you know it was all bends  around the mountain. We just rounded a bend and heard a bang from the  truck behind us. Went back there and the section leader lay dead.  Concussion mortar had come in and got him. There was incidents like  that that we were already scared, but it made us more scared. Like  walking down that mountain in front of that truck that night, I just  expected to get shot any time.  Did you have any other wounds other than being shot? Frostbite or  anything?  Frostbite.  Whereabouts?  My feet and hands.  Was it first degree or second degree frostbite, or   ?  First degree. I   ve told the doctor this, but he don   t confirm it. I think I  got my lungs frosted, too, from breathing that air that night.  That cold air?  Yes.  From what I   ve read and what I   ve heard as far as breathing out, your  breath would just kind of hang there in the air, is that right?  Well, we had scarves over  our mouths  and our breath would freeze.  Our scarves would be solid ice.  Would you take turns going into the tents, or anything like that, to kind  of warm up?  The infantry, more or less, had the warm-up tents. I never seen any  artificial heat from the time we burned our equipment until I got to  Japan.  19  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Any other particularly memorable experiences while you were there?  In Korea?  Around Chosin, around the Chosin Reservoir.  No, not really. I mean, like I say, we thought we were doomed. We  didn   t think we was going to get out of there and things were kind of a  blur, you might say. I didn   t know where we were or how long we were  there or anything. I have read a few books and did some studying. I  finally figured out where we were and where I got wounded. And for a  long time, I didn   t know. I was kind of bitter when I got out and I tried  to block it, but you can   t block something like that.  So let   s talk about that, I guess, for a little bit. As far as coming out,  being bitter, were you just bitter at the military or the situation or just  being shot, or what exactly?  Well, we more or less blamed McArthur for not using information he  was fed about Chinese being there. He just says,    It   s just a bunch of  laundrymen. Don   t worry about them.     But they weren   t.  No. They were very well trained. In fact, a lot of them were part of  Chiang Kai-shek   s troops when he was fighting communism. A lot of  them were from that skirmish. When Chiang Kai-shek was fighting  communism, we were over there helping them. We were supplying them  with arms, and them arms is what they were using on us up there at the  reservoir.  That would have been only a few years before, with Chiang Kai-shek.  Yes, well, it was in    48, they pulled out of China. In    49, he finally gave  it up to the communists.  Were you awarded any medals or citations or anything like that?  I got a Good Conduct Medal, a Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation,  Korean Presidential Unit Citation, and a National Defense Ribbon. I  didn   t have the opportunity  for any other medals , I guess.  Well, how did you stay in touch with your family during that time, or did  you? Did you get mail or anything like that?  20  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  We   d write letters whenever we had the opportunity. Few and far  between.  So did the military notify your family that you   d been injured? Or did  you have to do that yourself?  See, I didn   t have a mother. It was just my dad. He was bad at  communications other than talking, best I could get out of him. I was  wounded on the fourth of December, and he didn   t get notified until the  middle of January. The fifth or sixth of December, I got a hold of the  Red Cross and sent him a telegram that I   d gotten wounded.  Do you have any idea how many casualties there were in your unit?  In my particular unit, no, I don   t know that. Like I say, it was artillery  and it was fewer than the infantry.  This seems kind of redundant, but did you experience any pressure or  stress while you were there? I know you said that you guys kind of felt  doomed.  Yes. As far as pressure, no. Stress, yes. It was strenuous fighting the  cold and the war. The only instant of any pressure was the night that  gunny got me up after I just stood watch. (Laughter) I never questioned  him or anything, I just did what he asked me to do.  Did you carry anything that was like a good luck charm or anything that  was special?  No, I didn   t have anything.  Nothing like that. A diary or any kind of journal, did you keep anything  like that?  No. I talked about my dad being bad on communications   I was, too.  (Laughter)  Well, the apple doesn   t fall too far from the tree, I guess.  Yes. (Laughter)  Where were you when the Korean War ended?  When the Korean War ended?  Yes.  21  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  I was working on a farm.  Whereabouts?  Iowa.  Back in Iowa, okay. Did you do that for quite a while? What were your  plans coming back? I should have asked you that first, but what were  your plans getting ready to head back to the States? What were you  looking to do?  Farming my dad   s farm. (Laughs)  Just go back and farm your dad   s farm?  Yes.  You said he was going to do that fifty-fifty with you?  Yes.  How long did you do that?  Just two years. It didn   t last. (Laughter) I hired out to other farmers after  that.  And then did you go back to school or use your GI Bill or anything like  that?  No, I lost that.  Lost it. Just didn   t go back and it lapsed, is that right?  Yes.  How about your close friendships from the marines? Do you maintain  those today, any of those?  No, I didn   t. Like I say, I was kind of bitter when I got out. The only one  I remember is Corporal Riddle, our section leader, was from Salt Lake  City. I have tried ever since in any book or anything to find him, and I  can   t find him anywhere. I had no address or anything. I used to know  his first name, but I forgot that, now. But, no, I had no other contacts.  Did you join any American Legion or VFW  Veterans of Foreign Wars   22  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  or anything like that when you came back?  I joined the Legion right away when I got out, and I   ve been a Legion  member pretty much ever since. But I joined the VFW and the DAV   Disabled American Veterans  and the Marine Corps League, and the  Purple Heart Association. I   ve joined all them in the last few years.  But no desire to back then, back in the    50s, to join up with them.  No, no. In fact, I didn   t know there was a Marine Corps League. There  was no DAV or VFW close to me. A Purple Heart, I didn   t know there  was an association with them, either.  How do you think your experiences at Chosin affected your civilian life?  I think a lot of my marriages was affected by that.  How many times were you married?  Three.  Three times, okay.  There   s other instances in my life that I think that had an effect on. Like  I say, I was bitter because of what I had been in. I don   t know, I just  kind of turned my back on the world. Get a job, I would work and try  and forget things   busy making a living.  So was it anger issues or   ?  No, it was   I don   t think I could say it was anger. It was just what I had  been through, it worked on me. I had to keep working to get it off my  mind. There were times I couldn   t sleep at night when it   d start in on  me.  Do you think your wives had any idea that that might have been part of  it?  I don   t know if they did or not. They never talked to me much about it. I  never talked to them much about it.  Is that a regret, maybe? Not talking to them about it?  Yes, yes. I find out now that I have joined the Chosin Few and the  Marine Corps League that you talk to these guys and they   re the same as  you. It helps to get it off your chest where the wife didn   t know what I  23  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  was talking about or didn   t have an interest in what   you know what  I   m talking about, there.  Yes, I do. Do you think your experience in the marines influenced your  thinking about war or just the military in general?  Both.  How so?  Well, when Desert Storm   I wanted in the worst way to go back in and  go help. I was too old. (Laughs)  How old were you at that time. That would have been    91, right? Ninety  or    91?  Yes. Well, I was sixty.  You were sixty at that time? Okay. But you were a little too old, they  wouldn   t take you.  No. (Laughter)  Tell me why you wanted to go back at that time, for Desert Storm. Can  you explain that?  Yes, I wanted to help fight for the country. I guess I felt I had something  to contribute because I   d been through it.  If they   d have let you back in at that time, what would you have done?  What would you have volunteered to do, teach classes or teach training?  Yes, I was probably too old to go into combat, but I could be an  instructor, yes. That   s what I thought of. See, when I got back from  Korea, I went to Paris Island, South Carolina as a drill instructor. Like I  say, my senior drill instructor was a combat veteran, and they were  taking combat veterans from Korea and making them drill instructors. I  think that helped train recruits, as someone who had the experience.  Did you enjoy your days as a drill instructor?  Yes and no. I got married and that ruined it.  Because of the hours?  A drill instructor   s life is not for a married man. (Laughs)  24  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Kinkade  Myers  Don   t you live in the barracks for pretty much the cycle?  Pretty much, yes,  but you can also live off base .  So it would have been, what, sixteen weeks you would have been in the  barracks with your recruits?  Yes.  Yes, that would be tough on a relationship. Well, I   ll ask you this. I   ve  asked this to several other gentlemen I   ve talked with. Is there any kind  of examples of humanity, either good humanity or poor humanity, that  you saw there in Chosin or during the Korean War?  Well, before Chosin when we made the Inchon Landing and were in  Seoul, I seen one of our interpreters working a North Korean over with a  rifle butt. I guess you could say that was   well, and as we were  advancing north of Seoul, we would come along dead civilians that  would have their fingers chopped off, where they   d taken the ring off  them or something. The North Koreans   well, the Chinese, I don   t  think, were as bad as the North Koreans. But they were rotten.  Anything good as far as humanity? Any good examples?  Oh, I didn   t personally experience it, but I   ve heard of the Chinese  letting a POW go back to a unit, because the way of the weather, they  didn   t want to bother with them. They couldn   t feed them or nothing.  We, in turn, did the same sometimes. Just every now and then.  Send them on their way and let them make their way back. I   ll be. Well,  is there anything that you   d like to add that we haven   t covered in this  interview?  No, we   ve pretty well covered it, Joe.  Okay. Well, I want to thank you for taking the time to sit down with me  and discuss the Battle of Chosin and your time in the service and  thereafter. I certainly appreciate it.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
