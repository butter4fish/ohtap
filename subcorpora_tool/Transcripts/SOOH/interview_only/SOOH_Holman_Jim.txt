 Myers, and I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is April 25, 2012, and I   m in Tulsa, Oklahoma meeting  at the office of Jim Holman. I   ll be interviewing Jim today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history series of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. Thank you for meeting with me here, today. Jim, can  you tell me a little bit about your family and what your childhood was  like?  My childhood?  Childhood.  I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. This would have been 1933, the  Depression Era. There were six children, Mother and Father, and we  were not well-off people. Nobody was in that day and age. My dad  worked at Kroger and he was what they called the tally man. The tally  man is the man that works the docks that counts produce when it comes  in. He would check the produce and count the produce and he would cull  the produce. Anything that he didn   t think was worthy or spoiled or  tainted, it would go in a pile. During the Depression, when the day was  over, he got to load all that on his little flatbed truck that had sideboards  on it and bring it home. Then everybody within a two block area would  show up at the house, and they would strip the bad parts off and salvage  what they could, and they would split it among everybody in the area.  One thing I remember very vividly was they made homemade bread at  that time. The women would all be cooking the bread, and the smell of  that bread was just fantastic. That   s one of my memories as a child. And  that   s when they had the ice men that came around and you   d put the  sign in the window. They   d leave twenty-five or fifty pounds of ice.  That   d be a big block of ice.  5  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Oh, that   d be a big one, yes. Then going to school, in kindergarten,  Yeager School. Then a little later Whittier School. Then I ended up at  Manual High School. They called it Manual High and Vocational at that  time, because at that time. Now, it   s the 1940s. It was a very, very large  school on Fifteenth Street, which is now Truman Road. They had a full  basement. I mean thousands of square feet. They had the GI Bill to  where they would train GIs at the vocational part. And then the  basement, at nights, it would be filled with returning  WWII  veterans  and such that would learn their skills there in the basement. The claim to  fame for Manual High School was a gentleman that graduated there, his  name was Walt Disney.  Wow, I see.  So, that was the claim to fame. After going through my sophomore  year   well, I   ll back up a little bit. During that time, as a child, I always  had a job. I always worked doing whatever. I swept out stores, I worked  washing dishes. I got my social security card at age eight. I just learned  to write my name. It was Jimmy D. Holman, which I later had to change  my name because that wasn   t right. Then when I was a sophomore in  high school and my brother was in the marine corps, he was a master  sergeant. I   d always admired him very much, and I wanted to be a  marine.  So, when I graduated from my sophomore year, I took my birth  certificate and ink eradicator. Then, there were two chemicals you could  put on it. I put one chemical on and then I put the other and the ink  would fade away. Then I typed in where my year born was and made it  what I wanted it to be, to make me of age. Then I creased it and folded  it, and I went to the recruit depot and joined the marine corps. But it was  the marine corps reserve. I joined on June 23, 1950. Two days later, the  Korean War started and they activated the reserves. (Laughter) So, I had  never heard of Korea, but I found myself on a train heading for San  Diego and then through basic training in San Diego and advanced  combat training at Camp Pendleton. Then they sent me straight to Korea.  Now, you changed your age from sixteen to eighteen?  To seventeen.  So at that time, at seventeen, you could sign up on your own?  You could sign up.  Didn   t have to have your parental signatures or anything like that?  6  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  They approved it.  Oh, they did?  Yes.  Okay. Very good. So June 25th  you   re activated , you   re on a train  in  August  headed west to Camp Pendleton.  San Diego Recruit Depot.  And off to boot camp. How long was your boot camp?  Ten weeks.  How was that? What was that like?  Because of the Korean War starting, it was very hectic. All the barracks  were filled. They set up tent camps out on the sand. So, we were actually  in tent camps and that   s where we took our training and stayed there in  the tent camps. It was ten weeks of training, and I will say it was very,  very good training. Very good training.  What kinds of things did you learn there, specifically? Anything that  comes to mind during that basic training that was either extremely  memorable or extremely difficult?  Well, to get you in shape, physically, which, very rigid. You were up at  dark, four or five o   clock in the morning, did the calisthenics. Then you  would go ahead and do whatever they had planned for you, whether it   d  be go out on the boondocks or whatever. Then you had schooling.  Schooling on how to use your weapons, the nomenclature, practicing  grenade throwing, and things like that.  So at the time you were sixteen. What was your impression of the overall  view of the United States going back to war so soon after World War II?  I was young. Even though I knew they said it was   they didn   t use the  word war, then. It was a conflict or a police action or whatever. I really  didn   t relate to it being anything like World War II. I knew about World  War II because my brother was there. But I didn   t even think   I   d never  heard of Korea. I didn   t even know where it was or anything about it.  But I just knew that we were going through some very vigorous training  and that   s probably where I would end up, in the infantry.  7  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  So the infantry ended up being your MOS  Military Occupational  Specialty ?  Yes. When I got out, it was actually cook striker.  Cook striker, okay. While you were at boot camp, you were training to  be infantry?  Yes.  Is that  0311  or something like that?  It   s  0311 .  So you were in training for ten weeks there at boot camp. After boot  camp was over   well, let me ask you this. Any friends you picked up  there at boot camp?  Yes. The first night in San Diego, because my brother was stationed  there, he was going to take me   and there were other guys there I didn   t  know   but he had room for like six in his car. So, we loaded up and  went to Tijuana. When we got to Tijuana, it was quite different than  anything I   d ever seen. With the guys down there   you can delete what  part of this, can   t you? If it   s not     Sure.  Okay. So, when we got to Tijuana, we went into a bar. We were all  sitting at the bar and there I am, a kid. I   m sixteen years old and my  brother is next to me, and all at once here the women came. They were  all over us. One of them, she was all over me, which just kind of  spooked me. She looked at my brother and said,    What   s the matter? Is  he a cherry?    He said,    Yes.    She says,    I cherry, too.    So, when we got  back to the base the next morning, everybody is falling in. Again, we  didn   t even remember the names of one another, but when I came out to  fall in, one of the guys that had gone to Tijuana looked out and said,     Hey, Cherry     So, that was my name through the marine corps.  Stuck with you.  Cherry Holman.  From the first night.  From the first night.  8  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  All right. (Laughs) Do you remember any of your drill instructors,  there?  Sergeant  J.E.  Duncan  and  Corporal  L.R. Higlee .  Okay. Well, even if you don   t remember his name, what makes him stick  out in your memory? That drill instructor you had there in San Diego.  I thought he was very mean. (Laughter)  How so? How did he demonstrate that?  Well, in basic, when we were out there in the tents the first or second  day there, he had you doing everything and you were tired and all that.  And then it   s dark and,    Okay, we   re going to fall out here in a minute,  and you   ve got five minutes to take a shower and be back here.    Then,     Fall out     And everybody ran for the showers and I did, too, but by the  time I got there and got my clothes off to get in, everybody is getting  out. So, I knew I didn   t have time to put my clothes back on and I went  back. When we got back and everybody was in line, he said,    Did  everybody take a shower?    And I thought he saw me.    He saw me,     that   s what I thought.    Yes, sir     everybody said.    Anybody that didn   t  take a shower?    I knew he saw me and I thought I better   so I said,     Here, sir        Who   s that?       Private Holman        Front and center      I went front and center and he took a flashlight and shined it in my face.  He said,    Well, Holman, you   re not even dirty, are you?    I didn   t know  what to say, and I said,    No, sir.    He said,    Well, let   s make you dirty.  Get down on your hands and knees,    and I did. He said,    Now, get on  your belly,    and I did. He said,    Now, crawl like a snake,    and I did. He  put his foot on my neck and pushed my face in the sand while I crawled  like a bulldozer pushing up sand. After a while, with the burs and all  that, I got up. He told me to get up. He shined the light and he said,     Well, you   re dirty now, aren   t you, Holman?       Yes, sir        Then go take  a shower in five minutes and be back here.    So, that   s one of the reasons  I really didn   t care for him. It did nothing but go downhill after that.  (Laughter) But he was good at what he did. He was good at what he did.  What can you tell me about your initial military job, being in infantry?  What comes to mind about that first job?  Well, when you say the first job, you mean when we left there and went  to Camp Pendleton?  Yes. You went from San Diego to Pendleton to train for the infantry,  correct?  9  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Yes, when I left San Diego, then you go to Camp Pendleton for  advanced combat training. Then you go on, I guess, bivouacs. You go  out and the enemy is out there and then you   re attacked by the enemy  and how you react to that. Then you take your winter combat training on  Big Bear Mountain, which is snow and all that, for winter combat  training. You just get more in-depth into what you would actually face in  the combat.  How effective was that training, do you think? How well did that  prepare you?  Excellent. Excellent.  How long did that training at Pendleton take?  It was three months, probably  three  months because in between there,  they gave us leave from boot camp for a week. And then to Camp  Pendleton, so probably  three  months, I think.  So you   re wrapping up that advanced training, probably, sometime in      It was over in February 1951 .  Who were some of the men that served with you there?  Some of the first names, I don   t remember, but last names were  Hawkins, Hatch, Hilgenberg, Holtke, Holman (me) and  also  Green.  That   s because when you   re assigned your racks in the barracks, it   s  alphabetical. Is that right?  Everything is. The chow line, pay line, everything is alphabetical.  Did you know any of those guys prior to heading out to San Diego? Did  you head out as a unit, as a reserve unit out there?  No. I met all of them in San Diego.  So you guys were from all over the country.  Yes.  How did you guys entertain yourselves?  Well, we didn   t in boot camp. In Pendleton, we could have the weekend.  10  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Oh, golly, we   of course, then, money was   there was not a whole lot  of money. As I remember, we got like seventy dollars a month or  something like that. But we would go to town and we would have a  drink, if it was a place that we could get a drink because of the age limit  and all that. Even though you were in the military, you still couldn   t get  a drink a lot of places. And then the movies and such as that. Then we  all chipped in together and bought an old car. It was a horrible car. They  wouldn   t let us bring it on the base because it was so bad. (Laughter) We  didn   t have insurance, so we had to park it in front of the base. Then  when we would go out, everybody would get in it, pack in it, anybody  that we knew, if they could fit in there. We   d go to town in that car,  which would be Oceanside. That was the closest town.  Do you remember what kind of car that was?  I   m not for sure, but I think it was like an old Hudson Terraplane, where  the hood was longer than this table here. (Laughter)  As far as while you were in the service, where did you travel while you  were in the service? All the different places, do you have just kind of a  short list of where   ?  You mean in Camp Pendleton?  Just all over, during your time in the regular marines.  The only duty that I ever saw in the marines was San Diego Advanced  Combat Training, then straight to Korea. Served my time in Korea, came  back on a troop ship to San Francisco and then by train down to San  Diego. Then went in and was mustered out and went home. I never was  privileged to see anything other than that. As a matter-of-fact, at that  time, I remember coming home I saw a big billboard about,    Join the  marine corps.    I had to laugh because it showed a marine with a M1 rifle  and he was looking through the sights of the rifle and it said,    See the  world through the sights of a M1.    So, that   s how I saw the world.  On a lighter note, were there any pranks you guys pulled on each other  while you were in training?  I don   t think you want me to mention them all. (Laughter)  It   d be fine if you   re fine with it. We   d be fine with it as well.  Well, the DI, I wouldn   t say they were pranks that he pulled, but like  Holtke, one time, called his rifle his gun. He made him come front and  center in front of the whole platoon and take his privates out and hold  11  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  his privates with one hand and his rifle with the other and say,    This is  my rifle and this is my gun. And this is for work and this is for fun.    He  had to go up and down in front of everybody and do that.  Sure. What unit were you in when you shipped out for Korea? You  shipped out from Pendleton?  Shipped out from Camp Pendleton. As far as what unit, I haven   t any  idea. At that time everybody that went over was infantry, though. They  stacked us on the ship. I believe there were seven bunks on top of one  another. We ran into a storm on the way over and after two days, we had  lost ground. The storm was that bad. I didn   t get sick, but I think  everybody on the ship was sick. They would run upstairs to get some air  and throw up over the ship. But when they   d throw up over the ship, that  wind would catch it and throw it right back up on everybody. So, it was  pretty messy and pretty bad.  Oh, man   Then we went to Kobe, Japan.  How long was the trip over to Kobe from Camp Pendleton?  It took us, as I remember, ten or twelve days to get there. But we   d lost  some time, too.  Because of the storm.  Yes. Then when we got to Kobe, we got just a real short leave. When I  say short leave, oh, maybe five hours or something like that. But the  reason we went to Kobe was to leave all of our uniforms, all of our gear,  other than what you needed for battle.  I see. So you   re coming in in   ?  This was March. Yes, we   re up to March, now.  So, you   re coming in from Kobe. How long were you there and where  did you go from Kobe?  Pusan. We landed Pusan on April 3rd. I remember as we were debarking  the ship, as we got off, I just   knowing it was Holtke   s birthday   I  forget what I had, I had a little something and I just stopped. Because,  again, alphabetical, we were right next to one another almost always. I  started singing happy birthday to Holtke and the whole ship joined in     Happy Birthday.    So, that was quite a birthday for Holtke.  12  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  That   s outstanding. (Laughs) That was at Pusan?  That was at Pusan, yes.  What was the plan at Pusan? What were you there to do and then from  there moving forward?  When we got off the ship, we had no idea what   s planned for us. At that  point, getting off, they   re directing everybody to trucks. Different trucks,  different areas, and so we got over to the truck we were to get on. After  it was loaded, the trucks started taking off in a convoy. They were  heading north  for about one hour. We then loaded on a plane and flew  to east-central Korea, about the thirty-eighth parallel. Then we loaded on  trucks and traveled for about three hours arriving somewhere in North  Korea to the front line. Then we were assigned  to different companies. I  went with Able Company, as did Holtke and most of the others with our  alphabetical deal. That was the first night there. That was on the line at  that time.  Then the next day, you wake up and it was pretty much stationary. So,  you get your feeling of what   s going on and what   s happening. Then that  night, the first full night there, Hatch was a BAR  Browning Automatic  Rifle -man. In the wee hours of the morning, I don   t know, two or three  o   clock, whatever, Hatch cut loose with his BAR. So, when he did, of  course, you can see the fire and see kind of where they   re going and all  that. Some others joined in and all that. Then it subsided and the next  day, what happened was Hatch had the watch and he kept looking at this  tree and all at once, this tree started moving and had legs and arms, and  it was his imagination. (Laughter) But he woke everybody up, anyhow.  I   m sure he did. You might explain to us what a BAR is.  Browning Automatic Rifle. It   s kind of like a machinegun, only it   s not  a machine gun. It   s clip fed. Where the machinegun has them going  through, the BAR is clip fed. But it   s an automatic weapon.  If I understand correctly, since you   re on the line, everyone is dug into  foxholes.  Yes.  Do you have overhead cover for those foxholes?  Foxholes or trenches or whatever. At different times it was different  circumstances. Sometimes you had better cover, sometimes you didn   t.  13  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  If you had to make improvements to that, to your foxhole, those were  done by you and your fellow soldiers. Is that right?  Yes, you had to dig your own unless you took over positions where the  enemy already had trenches and such, there. You could use that.  Was there a period of time, or can you remember when you had your  first direct contact with either the North Koreans or with the Chinese?  When you say direct contact, you could   as I remember the first time, it  was at a distance. You could see them and you could fire at them, but we  didn   t get any return fire. We could see them in the valley in a column.  They were probably too far away for our fire to really be correct or be  accurate. But there was artillery called in on that.  Do you remember roughly where you were in Korea at that point in  time?  A lot of the guys can remember where they were and all that. I  think I  was in the area of Inje . Back then, I may have known some of the  towns. I don   t remember any of the towns    names or where we were or  even the hill numbers. They didn   t tell us hill numbers. Now, I know  guys know hill numbers. I asked them. I said,    I never did know a hill  number.    He said,    Well, neither did I, then, but I found out later what  the hill number was.    So, we just went where they told us to go.  Right. So your unit actually came in   did you move up near that Chosin  Reservoir or anywhere in that region?  No. When they left the Chosin, they went clear on back to far South  Korea. Basically, I was on the push back north with the replacement  troops that came in. Chinese had come down so far, now we   re trying to  push them back.  I see. Did you have any close encounters? Close, up-front conflicts with  the North Koreans or the Chinese?  Yes, of nights when there was   well, within like two weeks of being  there, that   s when the largest battle of the Korean War took place. That   s  when the Chinese had their Spring Offensive.  Can you talk about that for a little bit?  Yes, as I understand it, there were  twenty-seven Chinese  divisions, but  I believe 250,000 Chinese troops that amassed this    (Cries)  14  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Take your time. Two hundred and fifty thousand, that   s a great deal of  troops. That   s a great deal of troops.  But they had their offensive. Anyhow, I remember there were, in the  night, there were bugles going, whistles. (Cries) And of course, we could  see   with the flares and such, we could see them. It was a slaughter.  That went on for   oh, golly, I think that went on for  seven  days.  That was in April of     That was April 22nd  1951  it started.  Nineteen fifty-one?  Yes. Hilgenberg, who I mentioned earlier, one of the guys with us, he  was killed in his sleeping bag that night.  By random fire, or   ?  I haven   t any idea. I don   t know if they bayoneted the sleeping bag or  shot the sleeping bag, or artillery. All I know is word came down that he  was killed in the sleeping bag. But he wasn   t right next to me. He was,  oh, I don   t know, so many hundred feet from me. Hawkins got hit that  night.  He was your buddy, is that correct?  Well, all alphabetically, we   d gone through boot camp together and all  that. So, did Hilgenberg. But Hawkins got hit and he didn   t get killed.  But of course, we don   t know because when they get hit and they   re  gone, they get them to the rear as soon as they can to be sent out of  there, evacuated. But the battle went on for a quite a while. Of course,  those were the guys who were close to me. There were lots of others in  that, but it was the largest battle of the Korean War. This was just a very,  very small part of the battle because here we are on a line that extends  from the east coast to the west coast of Korea. They hit the entire line.  So, even though there were 250,000, they were covering the entire line.  Then somebody said   which a lot of this I don   t know to be true, but  somebody said that the ROKs who is the Republic of Korea. We were  tied in with the ROKs and the ROKs had been overrun.  Were they to your east or to your west?  They would have been to our right. We were heading north. Would   ve  been the east. But the commander, whoever, they can plug the holes,  15  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  they can bring up the reserves and whatever, but I heard that they   d  given way. Other than that, just the fighting. One thing you do know is  when you get there, even though you   ve been through everything, you  accept it. You don   t question it. You just do it automatic, like sixth  sense. You do what you   re supposed to do. But when I got the full grasp  of it, you see guys that are shot, wounded. When you get the full grasp  of it, it   s when you happen to go back for whatever reason and you see  the amount of body bags, the choppers coming in, you adapt. You don   t  get over it. I guess you get hardened to it.  I could see how that would be.  Yes. Then the best thing that can happen is when you see your buddies  that are still there.  Still alive. I   ve talked to quite a few fellows, and I   ve got my own  buddies from the military, too. A lot of them talk about the profound  effect on their life from their experience in the military. Do you think this  changed your path, gave you more of a focus or somehow affected you  as far as how you move forward with the rest of your life?  Well, there was one time after I was out and I had the guys   after   thirty -five years, we got together, and I believe there were six of us  that had been there. In talking, all six were very responsible guys in life.  One of them, which was Holtke, Holtke had an ice plant in Peoria,  Illinois and did extremely well and supplied convenient stores with ice.  Another one, when he got out, he went back and became a pilot in the  marine corps and became a major. Then Paul Green, in Houston, Paul  got involved in politics and got pretty high up in politics in Houston. All  of them, everybody that was there, it seemed like they all became  responsible citizens and did well in life. Now, was it because of that? I  don   t know. But I   d like to think it had something to do with it.  How about yourself? What did you do after your time in the military?  Persevered.  Persevered?  Yes. When I went in the marine corps   you   ve seen pictures of New  York and ghettos and all that   I   ve never seen anything as bad as where  I lived in Kansas City. It was a ghetto area, it was a horrible area. It was  Eighteenth and Prospect. This was in the days of segregation, too. This  was the boundary of the blacks and the whites. There were lots of fights  that went on. There were lots of drunks, lots of bars. Then, they called  them winos, laying in alcoves in the streets and the buildings. The  16  diseases were terrible. You   d see some of them laying there that had  syphilis with their nose eaten off their face. I can   t really tell you how  bad it was, but it was pretty dang bad. The hookers there walked the  streets with their blankets under their arm, even with their children  following them. Maybe that   s one reason I wanted to join the marine  corps. I don   t know.  My mom and dad divorced when I was five. My mother became a  waitress. That   s all she knew how to do and did the best she could. It  was a hard, hard, hard life. Really hard. I always had a job, always  worked as a kid doing something. Whether it was cleaning out stores, or  it was   I made a little push cart. It was the first of World War II. I   d go  through the alleys. I could tell you the price of cotton, the price of rags,  steel. There was what we called junkyards, then. I   d go to the junkyard  and they   d buy what I had. The monies that I earned, I always gave to  my mom.  It was tough. I would get under the   go out at night, crawl under the  bridges. These are bridges over railroad tracks. The steam engines would  come by. That   s when they had steam engines. They   d throw that soot  and everything up, and the smoke, and choke you to death. But I would  drag my gunny sack behind me, and in the alcoves I would get pigeons  and put them in that gunny sack because I could sell them for a nickel a  piece to the black folks. They ate pigeons. I always had a way to make  some money and do something. I was street smart.  The taverns, they painted   there   d be like brick up this far and then the  windows, they   d paint about that much and paint around them so kids  couldn   t see in. But I   d carry my little stool and I could look over it. I  was a pinball wiz. They got to know me and a lot of the guys played  pinball with people in these bars. They would see me and tell me to  come in and they   d tell the others,    I   m too drunk to play, let this kid  play,    because they knew I could beat them. Everybody I played, I  whipped them. Then they   d give me some of the money for beating  them. So, it was a tough life. Like I say, I persevered.  When I got to Korea   you asked what kind of entertainment or what  kind of luxury or whatever. Whenever we could, we   d play cards. We  played poker and we   d gamble. I was a wiz. I   d win money and then I   d  hide out. I wouldn   t go around any games or nothing until you could get  your money out of there. I   d ship everything home except enough  money to get started again. So, I sent home a lot of money from Korea, a  bunch of money. The Stars and Stripes magazine over there, you could  read your newspaper, whichever. But they had a picture of this Mercury  Monterrey. Boy, I dreamed of that car all the time I was in Korea. I was  going to get out and buy that car and drive it home. I had enough money  17  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  to do it, but things don   t work like that.  When I got back to the United  States, I didn   t have any money. The money had been loaned to other  family members.   Going back to Korea just a little bit. You were involved in some direct  combat, there. In the time that you were involved there in that battle,  how many casualties do you think there were in your unit? Just offhand.  In our unit?  Yes.  Gee, I   ve never been asked that question. Just a bunch, but I couldn   t say  percentage wise or whatever. Again, because all I knew was my close  little group. My close little group, Hilgenberg was killed, Hawkins was  wounded, Hatch was wounded, me and Holtke made it, but I think  Holtke got shrapnel in his butt later, but not a big deal. Hatch, like I say,  he was totally disabled. I stopped, when I got out, to see Hawkins in  Kansas City. Hawkins was a small-frame guy. He was in a wheelchair  and he was totally disabled and horrible just to go in and see him. I   m  glad I went, but I wish I hadn   t gone, if you can understand because his  head hung down and saliva would run out of his mouth when he   d try to  talk. I don   t know if he died shortly thereafter or not. He had a brother-in-  law there, Hill. He was married to Hawkins    sister. Hill just wrote her  all the time and everything. Hill got a Dear John letter. She was  divorcing him. That liked to have destroyed him. Something else about  Hilgenberg, who got killed. Aboard ship, he had the top rack. He stayed  in his rack all day long and wrote letters to his wife back home. Every  day he wrote her letters, wrote her letters. He didn   t make it  three   weeks over there and got killed.  Did you get very much mail back, yourself? Or did you get any mail  while you were there?  No, I didn   t get much, hardly any mail. I can   t remember getting mail.  Did you keep a diary or a journal or anything like that while you were  there?  No, I wasn   t much for doing that. Holtke did a lot of that, though. Holtke  documented a lot of things. Like I say, we were real close. When we got  out of the service, we were close. Matter-of-fact, after  thirty -five years  of being out, my wife asked me one day,    You ever see or talk to any of  those guys you were in Korea with?    I said,    I wouldn   t even know how  to get a hold of them.    She said,    Well, sure, you know where they   re  from.    I said,    The only one I remember was Holtke and he was from  18  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Peoria, Illinois.    She said,    Well, call information.    I said,    Well, Barb,  that   s been  thirty -five years ago.    She talked me into calling  information and they had one Jim Holtke listed. So, I called and when he  answered, I said,    Is this the Jim Holtke that was in Korea with the  marine corps?    He said,    Yeah, who is this?       This is Holman.        Cherry  Cherry  Where you been? We   ve been trying to locate you all  these years. Everybody has been trying to find you     He had a list of all  the guys and their phone numbers and names. So, consequently, he  contacted them and I got some calls from them. Then I invited all of  them to come, we had a little ranch down in Southeast Oklahoma. They  all came to the ranch. We had a great time just reminiscing about what  had happened there.  Wow. Where were you when the war ended, when the Korean War  ended?  I was back in civilian life.  Back in civilian life.  Yes. Did it ever end?  It hasn   t, actually. We   ve been in a ceasefire since then, to this day.  They   re just   now, he   s rattling his saber at North Korea.  Once again, yes. Did you go back to work or did you go to school when  you came back?  When I got out of the service, in Kansas City, I got a job driving a truck  for the Teamsters Union. They paid pretty darn good, because of my  dad. He was a truck driver for the Teamsters. He got me on the same  company. I had an uncle that was a special agent for the Frisco Railroad.  My uncle said,    You don   t want to drive a truck all your life. You need  to get another profession and I   ll help you.    So, after a month or so, he  said,    You need to be a fingerprint technician.    Boy  That impressed  me, just that name, a technician, a fingerprint technician. I said,    Well,  what do I have to do?       Well, you   ve got to go to school,    and I enrolled  in the Kansas City Business College  under the GI Bill .  At that time, it may have changed now, but there were like seventy  women, and me. (Laughter) Because it was a business college and their  shorthand and all that kind of stuff. But anyhow, I went to the business  college.  Uncle Charlie  would bring me home from the railroad  fingerprints to classify. I started reading and studying how to classify  fingerprints. I was driving a truck five days a week making about  340 a  19  Myers  month. Finally, my big day came. He knew the Kansas City, Missouri  Police Department. He talked to Major Griffin. I went with my uncle  and interviewed with Major Griffin. After I filled out the forms, we had  them bring out fingerprints and give to me. So, I went over with the  equipment and classified the prints. The guy came out and proofed them  and I did great.  So, I was hired on the spot, and I was to start the first of the month. I  would be on days for a month and then I   d be on nights. I   d work six  days a week classifying prints. Then when I went on nights, I would do  the same thing six nights a week. They would start me at  225 a month.  After I would be there two years, I got like a twenty dollar increase.  Well, thank God I went to business college, I guess it helped me add. I  was making  340 and going to  220, from five days to six. (Laughter)  The Teamsters benefits were a whole lot better than the police force. So,  that was the end of my career with fingerprints.  So, from there, I drove a truck and then I went on to have my own truck.  So, I bought my own truck and held it together with baling wire and  chewing gum over the road on swinging beef and backloads of bananas  and chickens. Then I realized,    This is not for me.    So, I got a job,  again, Teamsters, driving a truck over the road for Montgomery Ward. I  was very fortunate. I was like one of the first people hired for  Montgomery, and so I had a lot of seniority. I stayed with them for a few  years and then my run changed to where I had more time at home.  I never was one to sit idle, so I looked in the paper and I got a part-time  job selling real estate. So, I drove a truck days or nights, whichever, and  sold real estate. Then, you could sell real estate without having a license.  You would act as an apprentice. This was in the state of Kansas. So, I  sold real estate and I did pretty well. Then when I took my vacation, I  did it full-time and I did great. So, I took a leave of absence and did  great. I took another leave of absence. Then when I went for my third  leave of absence, they said,    No, we know you   re selling real estate.  You have a job here if you want it, but we can   t give you another  extension.    So, at that time, I had to make a decision,    Am I going to go  into real estate, or am I going to stay here where I   ve got security, a  truck, seniority?    What made my decision is I thought,    I can always go  back to driving a truck.    So, I made the step into real estate. Since then,  I   ve made a pretty good life in real estate.  So, we were talking about how your military experience had influenced  your life after the war. Let   s step back a little bit and talk about any, as  far as during the Korean War, were there any times that you overrun  any of the Chinese positions or the North Korean positions or anything  like that?  20  Holman  Myers  Holman  Yes, we had overrun the enemy positions and at that time there was  trenches and bunkers and such. I was first at this particular one, which  was a bunker they had vacated, so I claimed the bunker because we were  going to be set up there for a while. So, I claimed the bunker and I  stayed in that bunker for a few days. Then I was having a problem and I  saw the Corpsmen and so then he sent me back to see the doctor.  What kind of problem were you having?  I was itching, just itching all over. Terrible itching, horrible itching.  Then when I got back, the doctor checked me and I had body lice from  that bunker. So, they put me on a helicopter and flew me back,  evacuated me. They had tents set up along the river. I went over to  where the tents were and there were showers in the tents, and I had to  strip naked and dispose of all the clothes in a pile. Then they dusted me  with DDT, and I went through the showers then came back and they  dusted me and I went through, and they did that three times. Then after  the third time, they issued me all new clothing. I put everything on and I  went back to the line. They flew me back up there.  Every so often, few days, a week, ten days, whatever it was, I would  break out. I   d break out in blisters, just horribly, with blisters. They  would give me calamine lotion to put on the blisters. This continued  until it would clear up and then it would come back and clear up. And  then I was rotated and left Korea aboard ship. We went to Japan and  when we left Japan, I broke out again aboard ship and I was quarantined  aboard the ship. I forget how many days, but I think it was like four or  five days I was quarantined. Then it cleared up.  When I got back to the States and finally was being mustered out, they  asked if anybody had any medical problems. So, I raised my hand and  they told me to stand over to the side. Then later they talked to me and I  told them about the problem. So, they held me and they checked it out.  A couple days later, they said,    Well, there was no record of it.    I said,     Well, in Korea, I could understand that, but aboard the ship, I was  quarantined. So, there should be something in the ship   s log of me being  treated.    So, then they held me longer and said,    No, there   s no record in  the ship   s log. If you want to stay here, we can go ahead and check it out  further. You might have to be here like sixty or ninety days while we  check it out or you can go on home.    I said,    I want to go home.     So, I went home and then I went to see the doctor whenever I would  break out. I   d see him and I told him what happened and he would give  me some medication and all that. Finally, I just started, over the years, I  would buy my own calamine lotion and I would put it on. After, I don   t  21  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  know, maybe fifteen or twenty years, I didn   t break out anymore.  However, at that same time, when I broke out, I would get cracks in my  hands and bleed. I don   t anymore, but one of my children, when she was  born she had blisters all over her. We  took  her in doctors, we had her  in hospitals. Then when we came to Oklahoma, she also had a mental  handicap problem along with that. She ended up at Hissom out at Sand  Springs. They never was able to clear up the blisters and all that. She  continued to break out. She finally passed away at forty-six with cancer.  So, I do not believe that veterans receive the proper information. I don   t  believe they   re checked out to see what really happened to them to  verify it and treat them, because I have been in the veteran   s hospital a  few times with pneumonia and other things. Every time I fill out forms  to go into a veteran   s hospital, I   ll mention that to them and all that, but  it just passes by. Nothing about it. I do understand that since that time,  they   ve outlawed DDT.  Yes, I think that was   I think they outlawed DDT in the late-   70s or  early    80s or something like that.  They should   ve.  When you came back, did you join any veteran   s organizations?  American Legion or VFW?  Not for sixty years. When I came to Oklahoma, my daughter asked me,  after we   d been here a long time, she asked me in 2010, I believe it was,  if she could make a shadowbox of my awards. I told her I never received  any awards. She said,    Everybody does.    I said,    Well, I didn   t.    So, I  told her I would write off to try to get whatever awards I had coming. I  wrote to the Department of the Navy, I believe it was, in St. Louis. After  several months, like five months, I   d never heard anything, so I went to  the VA here. I took a copy of the letter and I sent the letter certified and  asked them if they could help me. But after I told them everything, they  said they would suggest that I write them again. So, I didn   t.  Lo and behold, about a month later, I received them. So, it took about  six months to get them. Then when I received them, my daughter came  over and got them to put in a shadowbox, but she didn   t. She contacted  the Marine Corps League, and they arranged a formal ceremony to be  pinned, which they did at the Marine Corps Ball. Then just prior to that,  she asked me to ride in the parade, which I   ve never done before. She  wanted to get some pictures to put in the shadowbox. I said,    Sure, I   ll  ride in the Veterans    Parade.    When I went down to ride in the parade  with the Marine Corps League, I didn   t know it had already been set up.  They had the Chosin Few float. So, they invited me on the Chosin Few   float  with the Chosin Few guys.  The Chosin Few fought in Korea at  22  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  the Chosin Reservior.   After that, she asked me   well, she told me she got tickets to the Marine  Corps Ball for me to take Mom because it was her birthday the next day,  after the ball. So, I took her to the Marine Corps Ball and then as a  surprise, that   s where I was pinned, not knowing anything about it.  I  had no idea of the formal presentation of the awards being pinned on  me. One of the awards was the Combat Action Ribbon and Medal.   Because of that  ceremony , I became a member of the Chosin Few and  also a member of the Marine Corps League. So, now, I am, but I wasn   t  for sixty years.  Why do you think you weren   t? Was it a conscious decision or   ?  No, because when I went back to Kansas City, I didn   t want to stay in  Kansas City. I wasn   t there very long until I left Kansas City (Missouri)  to Kansas. Even with Montgomery Ward, I was stationed in Kansas.  Then from Kansas, not knowing anybody in the military, I came to  Oklahoma and I knew nobody in the military down here. So, I was not  really exposed to any of that until the deal with my daughter.  I see. Some of the other veterans I   ve talked to have expressed examples  of the best in humanity that they   ve seen, while they were in the military  and in Korea. Like examples of great humanity, and also, because most  of us tend to go, a lot of times, toward the negative, the worst types of  humanity. Did you see anything that just kind of comes to mind that are  examples of maybe the best examples of humanity, or the worst, or both?  No. I guess looking at the Korean people, I always thought the children  were wonderful. I felt so sorry for the children. They tried to be so  helpful and tried to do so much and do anything. But as far as the adults,  I had hardly anything to do with the adults, other than those that worked  around the troops in the pack trains, the ammo trains, and such as that. I  never knew any of them closely, though. The children, I did. I thought  the children were great.  What would you say if you had the opportunity to talk to some young  men who were looking at joining the marines nowadays during a  shooting war? Actually, we   ve got two shooting wars going on right  now. What kind of advice would you give those guys?  It may be contrary to the way they think now, and the way they train  now, from what I read in the papers and what I hear. I hear such things  as,    Make sure that whoever you   re in combat with has a weapon or they  do this or if you do something wrong, you   ll be charged with murder,  this, that and the other.    You get down in the dirt. It   s either kill or be  23  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  killed. If there is a group that   s coming after you, bunches and bunches,  and I   ve even heard like waves of wheat and such. They never did  appear like waves of wheat because they   re coming out of the trees. As  long as they   re running at me, I   m not going to make sure each one of  them has a weapon in their hand. To me, it   s either kill or be killed. I  think we are trying to be too   make war too nice. You can   t make war  nice. If you do, you   ll die.  I think that   s very valid. Very valid.  That   s something else. I have never been   I never get emotional. I  never. If I   ll be at the VA hospital, I   ll be   or try to talk, I get  emotional. So, I guess the war has affected me. I don   t do it any other  time, only when I think of it.  I understand that. I absolutely understand that. Do you think it   s   I  know, today, we refer to it as PTSD. Do you think you had any effects  like that through your life that   s affected you?  I don   t even know what that means. What   s PTSD?  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Oh, I   ve had lots of problems in my life, as everybody does, but it   s  never affected me   nothing like Korea. I have woke up nights, crying.  That   s part of it. That   s actually one of the elements of PTSD, is exactly  that.  But I   ve never been to any doctors about it or nothing. You   d think after  sixty-two years now     Well, it hasn   t been acknowledged as anything that   s been valid by even  the VA until ten years ago. Ten, fifteen years ago. It   s nothing anyone   s  been on the lookout for.  I feel sorry for these guys going in, now. I think they   ve got it tougher  than we did back then, with the rules. We have to   I won   t say we. I  didn   t have to play by the rules they have now. But they have to play by  the rules, now. They really think the enemy is going to play by those  rules? It   s the people, we   ve got people in the White House and other     they don   t know what the hell war is about. They have no idea. You  want to make a clean war? You don   t make a clean war. You don   t do  that.  There   s no such thing. What would you say is the best way to educate  24  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  Holman  Myers  people about the realities of war? Other than picking them up and  plopping them down into a war.  People are creatures of habit. If they   re brainwashed enough, through the  powers to be, that war is clean, that you do this and you do that, and they  try to make it something it   s not, stop doing it. Tell it like it is. I think  that would do more than anything. I think that   s what people should  know, how horrible    (Cries) Sorry about that.  No, you   re fine. You   re fine. There   s nothing to be sorry for, not a bit. Is  there anything else you think you   d like to add that we haven   t covered  so far?  Not really. Just one note. I   ll say that you have your rations that you eat  when you   re over there. They bring them to you or they   ll drop them in  by plane to you. They use to have the famous three: Pork and beans,  meat and beans, and beans. There was one thing that I loved more than  anything else. I would trade everything I had, and that was for ground  meat and spaghetti. I loved ground meat and spaghetti. Every time we  got them, I always traded and I had my ground meat and spaghetti. Then  one day, a bunch of tanks are coming by, and that   s wonderful because  they let us get on and ride on the tanks. I   m on the back of the tank just  enjoying life, and all at once, one of the guys said,    Look  Ground meat  and spaghetti     The tank had run over a gook. The gook had been dead,  but he ran over the gook. I saw that and I was never able to eat ground  meat and spaghetti after that.  Oh, my gosh. That   s definitely a terrible image.  Yes.  Terrible, terrible, terrible. Well, I want to thank you, Mr. Holman, for  meeting with me today. It   s been very, very, very enlightening.  Well, thank you for coming in.  I   ll be happy to see this added to our oral history.  Hope it does some good.  I hope so, too.  Maybe somebody can learn something from it.  I hope we all do.  -------  -------  25
