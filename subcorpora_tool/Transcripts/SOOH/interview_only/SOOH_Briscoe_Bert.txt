 Larson  Briscoe  Today is December 10, 2009. My name is Mary Larson. We   re here with  Dr. Bert Briscoe to talk about the 1957 anthrax outbreak in northeastern  Oklahoma. We also have Dr. Sidney Ewing in the room. Dr. Briscoe, I  want to thank you so much for coming here to help out with this project  and to do this interview. Could you start out by giving us a little bit of  biographical background first and just talk a bit about where you were  born and raised and a little something about your education and your  family?  I was born and raised near Edmond, Oklahoma. Went to Deer Creek  School. Went to Central State College at Edmond for two years before I  got accepted in veterinary school here at OSU. I graduated from the  university in the spring of 1957 and started work for the USDA on July  1, 1957. The first day on the job, I went down in southeastern  Oklahoma, and we had an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis in that area.  We were down there for two weeks, then they sent me out to do some  TB work out in southwestern Oklahoma. My boss, Dr. Pellet, he called  me up, and he said,    You   re needed in the Vinita area on anthrax.    I told  him I   d go by home and get more clothes because I knew it was going to  be a long spell. Got more clothes and headed that way. So, it   s the latter  part of July, the last few days of July. I don   t remember what day it was,  but I arrived there. The first day, Dr. Love, (he was the area veterinarian  in that area) he took me out and showed me where I needed to start on  vaccinating the cattle for anthrax. From there, it just kept going and  going for several months.  You were mainly involved in the vaccination effort?  No. I vaccinated for probably two weeks, and then I started being one of  the diagnosticians in the case. There were probably three or four  diagnosticians, veterinarians that were diagnosing and sending in  samples to OSU.  5  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Let   s start working backwards a little bit. You said you were working  with USDA, so you   d just gotten out of vet school.  Right. Graduated in May and started working for the USDA on July 1.  So, this was sort of a trial by fire.  Right, yes. Right.  You were basically getting there at the very beginning of the outbreak?  Right, right.  Do you remember what symptoms the livestock were presenting with at  that point?  I just seen one live animal. I seen a lot of dead ones, but it was such an  acute disease that it was very   the only live animal I seen was a dog that  had anthrax. He had it in his mandibular lymph nodes, and he couldn   t  close his mouth. We treated him with penicillin, and the next day he was  fine.  You did have one dog.  One dog was the only one I ever seen that   there was people that had  dairies. They would milk a cow at night, and the next morning it would  be dead. That   s how acute it was.  With any of the animals, like with the dog, is there anything that could  be done for animals that were presenting symptoms where the onset to  mortality wasn   t as quick? Was there any way they could be treated?  With penicillin or oxytetracycline. I   d heard of a few of them caught  early enough, but I never did see an animal that showed symptoms  because I was called out for diagnosing of the dead ones. We had  lepto sporosis  and anaplasmosis and anthrax, all three, more or less,  rampant.  Did that affect the animal   s immune system? I mean, did having one  affect the animal   s immune system so they were more susceptible to  others, do you think?  No, I don   t think so. No. The anthrax would just overwhelm the animal.  They   d get septicemia immediately.  So, it wouldn   t have mattered anyway.  6  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  No, no.  What sorts of facilities did you have at the time when you were starting  out, either with the vaccination or with the diagnostic work?  Okay. We had the best cooperation that I   ve ever had with diseases.  There   d be probably ten to twenty ranchers. All would go from herd to  herd, and they had pretty good facilities. Most of them had pretty good  facilities. They   d already have the cattle or the hogs or sheep or  whatever, horses, already penned up, and we   d just go from place to  place. There was all kinds of help. I mean, it was fantastic.  That level of response is unusual.  Yes. It seemed like whenever the word    anthrax,    it really gets people   s  attention. It did there, for sure, because there were a lot of animals being  lost, a lot of cattle being lost, a lot of sheep being lost, some horses,  some dogs and probably a lot of wildlife, too.  Any sense of what the losses were by the end of that outbreak?  Oh, I was on one place, and they had a death loss of fifty-six head of  cattle.  Do you remember which farm that was?  It was between Welch and Miami, somewhere in there, but I don   t know  exactly where. Fifty-two years is ...  What kind of precautions were you taking at the time, either doing the  vaccinations or especially the post mortems?  We had rubber boots, coveralls and rubber gloves and a lot of  disinfectant. I was carrying penicillin, myself, in a syringe because one  day a cow kicked or something and kicked the syringe out of my hand.  Hit me right there, and so I pulled out my bottle of penicillin and  syringes and injected all around the area. Then, I went to the emergency  room, and they gave me a tetanus shot, and I was scared for several  days, but it all worked out all right.  Let   s talk more about the vaccinations, or, I guess, go back to the very  beginning as far as what you know of the protocol that was involved  once the first case of anthrax was identified in an area. At that point,  what happened in northeastern Oklahoma once the first case was  identified or confirmed?  7  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Well, they called in a lot of help, a lot of livestock inspectors, a lot of  federal veterinarians. The state veterinarian got involved, and they  quarantined the whole area. Then, they called out the National Guard,  and they stopped all the outgoing trucks out of that area. It was about a  six-county area. Craig County, Ottawa County, Mayes County,  Delaware County, Nowata County and I think maybe Rogers County  had a little bit. But it was all up in northeast Oklahoma and some up into  Kansas, but we didn   t get into Kansas because they had people up there  taking care of that. People were trying to get livestock out of there, and  they finally called out the National Guard and really clamped down.  Do you remember what groups were involved besides the National  Guard in helping to enforce the quarantine?  I   m sure the sheriff and all his deputies in each county, but mainly it was  the National Guard. They were there for several months.  What was involved with the quarantine? Obviously, there were the  roadblocks and so on to keep from transporting animals. Were there  quarantines on livestock sales or meat or milk or eggs or anything like  that?  Oh, yes. There was a quarantine on   well, in fact, our headquarters was  at the Welch sale barn, and it had just been built. Never any animals  went through it.  Still brand new.  Yes, and we made our headquarters there. But, no, they shut down all  the sale barns and all sales of livestock and shut down the milk and  dairies. They had to pour the milk out. We found one dairyman had  some horses, and I didn   t know horses would drink milk, but they do.  These horses sure got fat over that.  Because otherwise they would   ve just had to have poured it out.  Right, yes. And eggs. They made them destroy everything.  Is it generally communicable through milk or eggs, or is it just not  known, or did they just not want to take any chances?  Well, in milk it could be contamination.  Animal byproduct of any sort.  Well, yes, not only that but just the spores being in the air could fall on  8  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  milk or in milk. I don   t know how it happened, but no one got sick or  died from the anthrax, as far as I know.  I   ve seen one report of a cutaneous infection with one farmer, but that  was it.  Right, yes. If it   s inhaled, that   s when it really gets an acute septicemia  in people.  With people, I understand there are diagnostic differences between  inhalation versus cutaneous versus gastrointestinal intakes of anthrax.  Right.  Were you seeing differences in cattle, or did it all seem to be a  gastrointestinal intake with them? Aren   t there diagnostic differences  with livestock like that?  In humans, they have the cutaneous that   s caused by an open wound.  Like years ago, when they had shaving brushes, the hairs on the shaving  brush would be contaminated with the spores. They   d shave, and then  they   d   or they   d put lather on their face, shave, and nick their skin.  Then they   d get the cutaneous sore out of that. Then, there   s another  way that humans can get it is, and it   s called Wool Sorter   s Disease  where people are handling wool and the wool   s contaminated with the  spores, and that   s inhaled, and that can be very acute.  The only thing I seen in animals was that dog, and he had apparently  eaten off of an animal that had died from anthrax, and it lodged in his  mandibular lymph nodes, and apparently slowed it down. He wasn   t  septicemic. He just couldn   t close his mouth, (Laughs) but the penicillin,  just one dose of penicillin, took care of it on him.  Talking about the quarantine again, do you remember how long that  was, when it started and how long it was in effect, approximately?  I started in July, and it was in effect then, and I left in November, and it  was released by then. So, I don   t know exactly the dates, but it was  several months.  If you could talk a little bit about what the vaccination process entailed  for the first part of the time you were out there, if you went out to a farm,  what would happen?  They   d have their cattle up. They   d be ready, and there   d be ten to  fifteen people there to help. Most of them had good corrals and facilities  9  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  to run the cattle through chutes and vaccinate them, but if they didn   t,  they   d rope them and tie them up, just more or less manhandle them.  The fastest way they could do it, that   s the way they done it. You didn   t  have to tell those guys a thing. They were interested in getting those  animals vaccinated just as soon as they could, so there wasn   t any  slowing down to it.  As far as where you were vaccinating, was that determined by the  headquarters in Welch on a daily basis, or were you just communicating  with folks and getting assignments as    You go to this area for this week,  this area next week   ? How were the logistics handled for that?  It was probably handled out of the main office there at the sale barn.  People would come in there, and everybody wanted their animals  vaccinated just as soon as they can. They would line up, a group, say,  west of Welch; I done a lot of work out there. It was all the neighbors in  one area. I   m sure the other people that were vaccinating, it was done the  same way. It was all pretty well coordinated out of the Welch  headquarters.  Do you remember for the time that you were vaccinating, which  communities you dealt with? You said you were out west of Welch.  Welch, Centralia, and then I got as far west as Lenapah. And then I got  down around Bluejacket, which is between Welch and Vinita, southeast  of Welch. Bluejacket, but I didn   t do the vaccinations very long until I  got a better job. (Laughter)  Which animals were you normally vaccinating? Cattle?  Cattle, yes. There was more cattle. On one ranch we vaccinated, oh,  probably 2,000 head of it. They had those cattle, and they had hogs too,  and we vaccinated a lot of hogs.  Is that where we have the picture of you chasing the hog in Life  magazine?  I think that was out, maybe, down around Bluejacket somewhere.  We   ll have to put a copy of that in with this interview. Do you remember  anything about what type of vaccination was being used at that time?  It was four, the number four. It was number four spore vaccine.  What were the particular qualities? Was there anything distinctive about  that vaccine? I mean, was there reason that particular one was used, or  10  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  is that just what was being used at the time?  Well, there   s one, two, three, and four. It   s the way they   re attenuated,  and apparently that   s   we had a veterinarian out of Washington D.C.  His name was Dr.  G.B.  Van Ness, and he was supposed to have been  the expert on anthrax at that time. I   m sure he   s the one that  recommended the number four spore vaccine.  Any idea, over the course of all of this, how many animals ended up  being vaccinated?  I   d say, probably, at least 100,000.  When you were working on the vaccination project before you ended up  doing the diagnostic work, how many veterinarians were out there, or  were there vet students who were working on the vaccination, or was it  people from USDA and the state veterinarian   s office? I   m trying to get  a sense of who was involved in the effort.  The state veterinarian, he was up there full-time, but he was in the  administration part of it, as well as Dr. Crow. He was with the USDA.  Dr. Crow, his boss was Dr. Pellet, and Dr. Pellet was also my boss. He  came up there one day, and he was trying to tell Dr. Crow what to do,  and Dr. Crow told him to just go back to Oklahoma City and that he   d  take care of it. And that   s what he done. (Laughter)  Dr. Crow had a sense of how to organize things there.  Yes, right, right. They were both older guys at that time. They   d both  had plenty of experience with other diseases like Texas fever and all that  stuff.  Is there a sense of what really got this particular outbreak going or why  it was able to take hold the way it did?  Apparently that spring, it was real wet, and then in the early summer, it  turned off real hot and dry. The grass grew up, and then the cattle eat  that grass down. The spores were on the grass as it grew up out of the  soil, and the cattle got that. But also there was another thing involved.  There was a tremendous number of horseflies in that area at the time. I  think they were spreading it. Something had to be spreading it because  we   ve never had it like that afterwards. I   ve thought about it a lot. Why  hasn   t it come back? It   s been fifty-two years, and it still hasn   t come  back, and that   s the worst one they   ve ever had up there.  So, do you think it was vectoring through the horseflies, or do you think  11  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  it was that with the horseflies, since they   ll take a chunk out of you, that  it was leaving an opening for spores to get into the system that way? I   m  not exactly sure on the details of how anthrax works, so I don   t know.  After a horsefly would be on an animal, there   d be blood ooze out, and  he was carrying blood to another animal, also, and could be infecting  that way. I think they had some part to play in it, because it spread so  fast. It covered about five counties just right fast, which is very unusual.  We   ve had it in southern Oklahoma several times, and it   s just a small  outbreak.  Because, from what I   ve read about it, it was notable for the size and the  speed.  Right, yes, yes. You   d go up into Vinita, and there   d be smoke coming  up everywhere. I mean, just everywhere, there   d be smoke where they  was burning dead animals.  To destroy the spores.  Yes. There was a few of them that were buried, but most of them, a lot  of them, were burned.  Let   s switch to the diagnostic work that you were doing. What all was  entailed with that part of the effort once you switched over to that?  They   d get the information in the main office, and we   d get it every  morning when we came to work: where to go, where all the dead  animals were. We   d just go from one place to the next. We   d have to  have our rubber boots on and coveralls and gloves. We   d have to  disinfect a lot of times during the day. Mainly what I looked for was  there   d be oozing of blood from the nostrils. They   d be bloated up and  decomposed right fast.  And it was summer so it would   ve been warm, which wouldn   t have  helped.  Yes. And there wasn   t much rigor mortis to them. They didn   t get real  rigid, and they   d bloat up, bloat up. A person could pretty well tell, but  we   d cut their jugular and get a sample of blood. Sometimes we   d cut  and get a sample of their spleen. Their spleen would be really enlarged,  and the pulp in it would just be kind of like jelly, only just fluid-like, and  that was pretty well a tell-tale lesion of anthrax.  So, would you take samples from each of these animals and send it back  to the lab here at Oklahoma A M?  12  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Yes, they had a courier that carried it back every day. They came in  every day with samples.  That would be some job, carrying all these anthrax samples back and  forth every day.  Yes, yes. I think it was a state guy that was doing that. I don   t remember  it exactly, but every day they brought them over here.  Once a diagnosis was confirmed in the lab, did that make any on-the-ground  difference, if there   d already been animal deaths at a particular  farm?  No, we could pretty well tell. They   d just go ahead and vaccinate them  and burn the carcass.  Did they usually just burn an animal where it fell, to keep from  spreading things?  Right, right.  I know that in past zoonotic epidemics in other parts of the world, you  see where farmers are required to put down some of their stock. Was  anything like that required with this outbreak?  No. We just vaccinated.  Because there was an effective vaccine, it wasn   t necessary.  Right. Apparently, it was getting immunity in them real fast because  they didn   t hardly lose any after they was vaccinated.  I was going to ask, about how long did it take?  I   d say probably two or three days was the length of time.  So, it kicked in pretty quick.  Right, yes.  Besides vaccination and quarantine, were there any other precautions  that could be taken to slow the spread? You had mentioned burning the  carcasses.  Yes, right. Burning or burying them. If there had been others, maybe if  they   d had some earlier deaths, burn those, or if they   d drug them off  13  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  somewhere, try to burn where the animal had died because there   d be  blood that would   ve oozed out of the mouth, nostrils and anus.  I was wondering if there were any steps that farmers could take to try to  prevent a recurrence, but it would really only be where they knew the  spores were as opposed to where they might be lying dormant.  Right. They can lie dormant for years and years in the right conditions.  And I   m not sure   well, I know that the wet weather makes the grass  grow tall, and then when it turns off real dry, the animals eat it down.  There might be something else that affects all that. I don   t know what it  would be, but it   s where it spreads so fast. I   ve thought about it a lot, but  it   s very unusual. Very unusual.  Do you think part of it was that water holes were contaminated as well  as the feed around it?  They could be, right, yes.  Because my understanding was there   d been some drought but then  some flooding?  Right, in the spring, earlier.  So, everything would   ve washed into water holes. Was it common in that  part of Oklahoma to have anthrax outbreaks?  No.  So, it was uncommon for the scope and the speed of the outbreak, but  also for the location.  Pretty well, yes. It was 1957. They said maybe twenty or thirty years ago  they   d had a little outbreak, but nothing like this one. Probably it was  brought in there with the buffalo or something, because South Dakota  and Nebraska and those states have it, small outbreaks of anthrax. Texas.  Do you think it has anything to do with where cattle trails used to be, for  moving cattle to market back in the days? Have you heard anything  about that?  If it had been on the Chisholm Trail or a renowned trail, but I   ve never  heard of a trail. Now, in southern Oklahoma, those outbreaks are pretty  close to the Chisholm Trail.  It wasn   t anything going through northeast Oklahoma that you   re aware  14  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  of?  Not that I know of, no.  As you were going through doing some of the post mortem work and the  diagnostic work, what do you recall about the spread of the outbreak as  far as how it moved from county to county, besides the speed which  you   ve mentioned already? Do you remember what the progression was,  or was it just so fast that      It just seemed like it was all over all at once, pretty well. One day they  sent me way down below the Grand River Dam, and there was an animal  down there, and that   s quite a ways from where it had started. And clear  down to Pryor. And clear over to Salina, they had a dead animal in the  river there, and they pulled it out. I got samples, and it was positive. It  seemed like it just all at once it was everywhere. Then, it kind of hit its  peak and then just kind of died away. I don   t know what caused that.  I know there were an awful lot of animals vaccinated.  Oh, yes.  Was there a particular strategy that you   re aware of with the  quarantines and the vaccinations, trying to start at one place and move  to others, or was it just trying to cover as much area as possible in as  short a time as possible?  Just starting up in the northern part of the state, the northern part of  Craig County, and working south, just everywhere. People would come  in, and they   d get lined up for twenty or thirty herds every day, and the  people who were vaccinating would go out and do it. But as far as a kind  of way of going through and vaccinating, it wasn   t that. Just whoever  got organized first, that   s where we went.  With the post mortems, would you be going from one farm to another,  just sort of hop-scotching over the course of the day?  Right, yes. It wouldn   t be right down the road. Like one time I went with  the county agent out of Ottawa County over to Picher. I remember a cow  was dead over there, and it had anthrax. Clear down to Pryor and east of  Pryor.  So, you could be just about any place in the course of a day.  Right, yes. Right. Just wherever they called in and said there   s animals  dead. And back then, about every one of them was anthrax. There was a  15  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  few that had lepto and a few had ana   because anaplasmosis, there was  quite a bit of it up there, them two. But you could pretty well tell by the  blood not clotting and the color of it, and the spleen. The decomposition  is so fast.  Is lack of rigor mortis, is that part of      That   s part of it, too, yes.  When you were going out doing the diagnostic work, did you have a  crew, or were you on your own, going from place to place? How did that  work?  Sometimes I had the county agent or the assistant county agent with me,  or somebody that knew the county and knew where to go.  That   s always helpful because some of these places are big, and they   re  laid out such that      Right, right. And that really helped. A lot of times they   d help plan out  the tour for the day, too, which really, really helped on that.  With doing the diagnostic work, which agencies would   ve been involved  at that point? It sounds like you had county agents and USDA.  The ones that were taking the blood samples and specimens were USDA  veterinarians, and we had two assistant state veterinarians. That was it.  The private practitioners, they had other things they had to do. If they  thought they had an anthrax case, they   d call us, and we   d go out and get  samples. The ones that were getting samples were veterinarians like  myself. I don   t know whether Harvey, Dr. Arnold, I don   t know whether  he took any samples or not, but it was probably three USDA  veterinarians and two assistant state veterinarians getting the tests.  Did you have anybody helping out from out of state?  We had veterinarians from Arkansas and maybe Texas.  Were they helping with the diagnostic end, or were they helping with the  vaccination?  They were vaccinating. There were several of those. Everybody that was  vaccinating were either federal or state veterinarians. There wasn   t any  lay people vaccinating.  How many folks do you remember being involved from the vet school  16  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  here? I mean, people that had been with the vet school previously or that  were working at the vet school at the time. We know that you were there,  and Dr.  Harvey  Arnold.  Right.  Dr.  Bertis  Glenn and Dr.  Roger  Panciera were involved.  Right. They were doing the work here at the lab. Let   s see. As far as I  know, that   s the only two.  I just didn   t know if you were running into other classmates out there.  No. No. Dr. Troy, he was probably from Missouri. I don   t know where  he   s from, but he was an old one. And then Dr. Riemenschneider, the  state veterinarian, he wasn   t an OSU graduate either. Harvey and I are  the only ones, and I think Harvey, Dr. Arnold and I, are the only two still  living of the veterinarians that worked up there.  I was just trying to get a sense of, out in the field, who all you were  running into.  Him and I were the only   and we were classmates, which was pretty  unusual.  What can you tell me about what you   re aware of with the economic  impact with the quarantines and having to get rid of the milk and that  sort of thing?  Dairymen were probably the most financially impacted by having to  pour out their milk for several months. The one farm lost fifty-six head,   which  would be a considerable loss. A lot of them probably lost 10  percent of their herd.  Do you know if there was any government aid ever made available to  farmers?  No. And the horse people, they couldn   t have rodeos or roping contests  or anything like that. That was all shut down.  That   s something else I was going to ask about. What else did it impact?  I don   t think there were any fairs in those counties, either, that fall.  That would   ve been, what, five or seven counties?  17  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Yes. Five, about five counties. Yes, I hadn   t thought about the fairs, but  they were shut down.  I saw the Vinita rodeo had been shut down. I was wondering, on a daily  basis for a lot of these folks, besides the extra work of doing the  vaccinating and everything else that was going on, what impact that had  on the towns beyond the direct obvious impact with the quarantines.  There were a lot of people that stayed in Vinita. They had a hotel there,  and there were a lot of us that stayed there. There   s some motels. But as  far as the farmers and ranchers, they were pretty well shut down for  several months, but they were very cooperative. As always, there   s a few  that are not, but as far as a disease and working with a disease  eradication or control, that was the best cooperation I   ve ever had in my  thirty-three years of working with diseases.  Are you aware of anybody at any of the farms or ranches that ended up  having to basically go out of business because of the impact, or was it  something where everyone sort of pulled together for a while and got  past on the other side of it okay?  I think they pretty well   I don   t know of any of them that went broke on  that account. I   m sure they all pulled together through this.  You   ve talked a little bit about some of the things that were unusual  about the 1957 outbreak. Are there any things beyond what we   ve  already discussed? There was the size and the speed and the location.  The location, yes, and the acuteness of it, of the animals dying. Like I  said before, the only live animal I seen with it was that dog. As far as  horses or cattle, they might be all right that night; next morning, they  was dead, which is very acute.  So, the general speed of anthrax, the speed from onset to mortality, is  generally not that short.  No, it usually is two or three days, maybe, but on this, it was  tremendously acute.  Do you have any sense what that could be attributed to? Just a  particular strain or the environmental conditions?  I don   t know. I   ve thought about it a lot. What triggered it all? Was it a  different strain? There was a lot of people that I   m sure inhaled the  germs. This one guy was the only one that had a cutaneous lesion out of  thousands of people.  18  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  So, it was virulent for the livestock but maybe not as much for humans.  Yes, because it was dusty. It was real dry, hot, dusty.  Summer in Oklahoma.  Right, yes. It looks like that with all that dust, there   d be spores in it and  people would get it, but no one got it.  That   s interesting. Do you think there was anything from the 1957 event  that people learned in terms of diagnostics or pathology or even just  logistics with trying to control an outbreak of that size?  The outbreaks we had in southern Oklahoma after that, they would jump  right on it. I   m sure they did this one, too, and they   d quarantine it.  That   s about the only thing I   I was so new at it, just out of school. I  learned a lot in just a few months about all kinds of diseases. Seen  anaplasts, lepto, anthrax.  You were really thrown into it. You got out of vet school, and there you  were.  Yes, and looking back on it, it was very interesting. It was a lot of hard  work, but it was very interesting to see what happened and try to figure  out why it happened and why it happened so fast. I don   t have the  answer. I don   t know anybody that has the answer. Dr. Van Ness, he  came, and he was there for a while helping us. He said it was the real  wet spring and the dry summer, but why did it spread so fast, or why  was it so virulent? Why was it in that area? Beyond me.  So, there were a whole lot of things that were unusual.  Right, right. And why hasn   t it happened again?  In fifty-two years.  Right. I   m sure we   ve had real wet springs and dry summers. It hasn   t  happened like that and may never happen again like that. I hope it don   t.  Is there anything else about that particular outbreak that we haven   t  talked about that you wanted to mention? Anything that we missed?  No, I think we pretty well covered everything that I experienced.  Once you had gotten over this baptism by fire (Laughs) as a freshly  minted veterinarian, what did you do? You were with the USDA; what  19  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  did you do with the rest of your career?  When I went to work, I figured I   d be a field veterinarian like that for six  months, and then go into meat inspection for six months, and then go  into private practice. This challenged me so much that I just wanted to  stay in that, so that   s been thirty-three years. There at the last, I was a  foreign animal disease diagnostician for the state, and that was quite a  challenge.  I would imagine. So, that would   ve taken you all around the state as  well.  Right, yes.  What sorts of things were you seeing that were interesting or unusual?  Well, like the practicing veterinarians would have something kind of  unusual, so they   d call our office, and I   d go out and check it out. And  mainly we were on cattle, making sure it wasn   t foot-and-mouth disease.  That was the main thing that we were really interested in. And then also,  I took care of the Oklahoma City Zoo on their animals that come in from  foreign countries, and we was checking for ticks on those that were  carrying foreign diseases. Ostriches got so popular, they were importing  some of those, and we was checking those for ticks that was carrying  foreign diseases.  Hadn   t thought about that.  Yes, yes. And then I done inspection of the research facilities also down  at the OU med school, the Dean McGee Eye Institute and up here. I had  a variety of things I worked with.  Did you retire out of that position?  Yes, retired out of that, after thirty-three years.  Is there anything else you want to talk about that we haven   t addressed?  No, I can   t think of anything.  Well, I want to thank you ever so much for helping out with this project  and contributing your wealth of knowledge to the information we   re  trying to gather. We really do appreciate it.  Yes. I thought about it a lot and why it happened. You know, why?  There   s other forces, apparently, or something besides what we   ve  20  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  Larson  Briscoe  talked about, that are involved. I read a lot about it, but they all say  about the same things.  It   s just something that no one   s quite figured out.  Right, right. And just like after 9/11, that anthrax deal, when they  apparently opened those envelopes, spores came out and killed those  people right fast. Why this outbreak? We were exposed I   m sure, and  none of us got it. I don   t know.  Do you think with some of the more recent strains, those are more  virulent for humans just because they   ve been engineered that way, or  do you think some of the natural forms?  Probably some of the natural forms are. I read where swine are more  resistant to anthrax than other animals. Why? You know, why would  they?  Is it something they   ve evolved over the years?  Yes. But there must be more varieties of it.  Well, thank you very much for your help with this. We really appreciate  it.  Okay. Thank you.  -------  -------
