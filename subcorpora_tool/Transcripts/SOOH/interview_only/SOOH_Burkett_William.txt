 Finchum  Burkett  Today is February 28, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library. Today, we are actually in the  library with Bill Burkett. He   s come to us today to share some stories for  our Remembering Henry Bellmon  oral history project . We thank you  for coming today.  Glad to do it. My pleasure.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little about yourself. Where you were  born and when, and then we will just work our way forward.  Well, I was born in Oklahoma City in 1925. Youngest of four boys. I  went to public schools in Oklahoma City and Norman. We moved to  Norman when my older brothers went to the university down there. We  lived there a couple of years. I had a great-uncle who had no children  and who also had a lot of money. He took a shine to me and sent me to  military school, which my parents could never have done. I went four  years to Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. Graduated  from there in 1944, a junior college. It was the hundredth anniversary of  the school.  Went to the Army   was a nineteen-year-old Second Lieutenant Infantry.  1945   sailed out of San Francisco in an eight ship convoy on the third  day of August of 1945. We were somewhere in the vicinity of the  Hawaiian Islands when they told us we had dropped an atom bomb on  Hiroshima. We didn   t know what an atom bomb was. Three days later     Nagasaki. On the fourteenth of August, the War was over. We were still  out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. (Laughs) Went on to the  Philippines. Was assigned to General MacArthur   s headquarters in  Tokyo. Came home, married my childhood sweetheart. We   ve been  married sixty-six years. Went to OU  University of Oklahoma  Law  School, moved to Woodward. Practiced law in Woodward for about  5  nineteen years, a little over.  I was the Republican County Chairman in 1958, I think. I met Henry  Bellmon in 1960, when he became Republican State Chairman. The  Republican Party was split in Oklahoma about five to two. Five  democrats, two republicans. The party leadership was not interested in  growing the party. The state chairman had considerable patronage when  there was a republican president, as there had been in the 1950s     Eisenhower. He appointed all of the postmasters. The chairman liked  that kind of power. There is a lot of postmasters in Oklahoma. They  weren   t interested in growing it, but a man named John Tyler became  the national committeeman. John Tyler was from Bartlesville. He found  Henry Bellmon, who was a wheat farmer in Billings   Noble County,  north of here, Oklahoma A M graduate, and made him the state  chairman. He talked me into running for the legislature in Woodward  County. The democrat incumbent announced that he wasn   t going to run  for re-election, so I announced. I had lived there about ten years, still a  newcomer. The incumbent changed his mind and decided to run  anyhow, but I beat him. My campaign cost six hundred dollars, I  remember. Times were a little different.  Henry was an outstanding state chairman. He changed the party. He was  very anxious to have the republican legislators  be active in the party .  There were only fourteen of us out of a hundred and twenty-five. We  didn   t exactly run things. Some of those fellows thought they had been  elected in spite of being republicans, not because of it. He wanted to  make us all active in the party, because they hadn   t been. No one had  been active in the party. Henry made us all members of the state  committee. He made the leaders members of the executive committee.  He arranged for the National Committee to meet in Oklahoma City at  the Skirvin Hotel. Barry Goldwater was a speaker. Barry was a  candidate for president, of course. Henry just was tireless. He traveled  the state. He issued a press release every day, blasting Senator Bob Kerr,  who was our very powerful senior senator. He just wanted to be noticed.  He traveled the state tirelessly.  I was elected to the legislature. That was J. Howard Edmondson   s last  two years. He had virtually retired. The state was being run by the  Speaker of the House of Representatives   a man named J.D. McCarty,  who later went to jail, tax evasion. The Oklahoma City Chamber of  Commerce paid him a thousand dollars a month to lobby for Oklahoma  City, and he didn   t report that on his income tax returns.  Henry   s campaign was the most physical campaign you could imagine.  He had a wife and three daughters. They traveled the state entirely.  South of Oklahoma City was strong democrat country. North of  6  Oklahoma City, that   s where all the legislators   elected republicans     lived, north of Oklahoma City. Henry would come to   like for example,  I was county chairman in Woodward. He brought his family to  Woodward at night. We had a breakfast for him the next morning. He  had what we called    two-party tea parties,    in homes with women sitting  around the room with lifted pinkies, drinking their coffee, with Henry  Bellmon standing in the middle of the room. He literally had a red neck.  Redneck has a meaning. It comes from the fact that the back of their  neck was sunburned from wearing hats. Entirely white forehead. He  would stand in the middle of the room, didn   t know what to do with his  hands, looking down at the floor, but oozing total integrity. Absolutely,  totally believable. You knew what you saw was what you got.  We had two-party tea parties in the morning, and then a luncheon, then a  two-party tea party in Mooreland, a little town ten miles east of  Woodward, and another one in Sharon, a little town south of Woodward.  At dinner that night, the two previous republican nominees for governor  were both from Woodward. Reuben Sparks and Phil Ferguson. He met  with them that evening. Then they drove to Alva to do the same thing all  over again. Wife and three kids. They went all over the state that way.  When the polls began to show that he really had a chance to win, we   d  never had a republican governor. The liquor industry offered to  underwrite his entire campaign   no deal. He wasn   t going to be  obligated to anybody. His opponent was Bill Atkinson, who was a  newspaper publisher in Midwest City. Henry beat him by 79,000 votes.  Barry Goldwater lost that election to Lyndon Johnson by nearly 200,000  in Oklahoma. Henry won by 79,000. He was just a marvel. He was also  a farmer. John Tyler told me one time that Henry called him at five  thirty in the morning. Said,    John, I   m sorry to call you so early, but I  waited as long as I could.    (Laughs)  His first day as governor, he went to the state capitol at six o   clock in the  morning and the door was locked. He had his wheat planted. He made  elaborate arrangements to go to Billings to plow after his wheat had  been harvested without anybody knowing it. He thought he would be  criticized for farming while he was governor. A newspaper reporter from  Enid, somehow or other, found out about it. Found him on the tractor     Henry would not talk to him. The fellow took a picture of Henry as he  drove away on his tractor. Henry called me and said,    I   m in trouble.  They found out. It   s going to be bad.    The reporter wrote a marvelous  story about this stranger that he met. Wouldn   t tell his name. Tongue in  cheek, entirely. Henry   s press agent, Bob Haught, couldn   t have written  it better. People admired it. That was Henry.  He had a plan for going to different cities, county seats, and by executive  order, declaring that that was the state capitol for that day. He would  7  tour the town, meet with various groups, have a luncheon of course. He  had Shirley and the three girls with him all the time. We had three  senators and fourteen house members, and yet he accomplished a lot.  Actually, J.D. McCarty was a good friend and cooperated and helped  him. Now, this was never publicized. They would blast each other in the  newspapers, but McCarty served him very well.  He had been elected to the legislature when he came home from World  War II, one term. He lost his re-election campaign. So he was not a  newcomer to it, at all. He was courageous. He was the absolute epitome  of honesty and integrity. I was really proud to know him and proud to  work with him. It was an absolute delight.  I felt like, as state chairman, I had an inside view of the governor   s  office. I had access to him all the time. He could only serve one term. He  was elected to the U. S. Senate in 1968 and Richard Nixon was elected  president. The president appoints the United States attorneys, federal  prosecutors. There are ninety-some of them in the United States, but it is  senatorial patronage. Henry nominated me to be U. S. attorney and I was  appointed. After two terms in the Senate, he announced that he would  not run again. I attended a meeting chaired by a banker from Norman     ten or twelve men, republicans, to urge Henry to run for re-election. He  wasn   t going to do it. He said,    Two terms is enough.    I remember the  banker said,    Look at Jack Javits.    Jack Javits was the United States  senator from New York City   been there forever, republican. He said,     Look at Jack Javits. He   s served       Henry said,    Yes, look at Jack  Javits. He doesn   t know where he is most of the time.    He was senile.  He   d been in there for a long time. He was a power. But he didn   t run.  He did run for governor again, and was elected. A little better support in  the legislature, but still no majority   not like it is today, where there is a  big majority. The statewide officers are republicans. That was not the  case, by any means. After Henry was elected governor, he and I were  invited to the Republican State Convention for Kansas to tell them how  we did it. It was just a marvelous thing, incredible. Nobody expected it.  The fact of the matter was, when I was in the legislature   fourteen of us  republicans   I think my second term we   d gotten to eighteen. The votes  weren   t republican/democrat. They were urban/rural, labor/management.  Everybody was conservative, whatever that means. Look at it now,  they   re the same people. It was just an absolutely marvelous experience.  He ran for re-election to the Senate and he ran against Ed Edmondson.  The Edmondson family is a distinguished family in Oklahoma. They  have served this state very, very well   attorney general, congressman.  Ed Edmondson was a congressman for a long time. Of course, Howard  was the governor for two terms. No, just one. One   s on the Supreme  8  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Court. The Edmondson family is distinguished. Ed Edmondson was  certainly a very highly qualified legislator for Oklahoma. But Henry beat  him. Ed contested. In Tulsa, the voting machines did not allow you to  just punch one button and vote a straight ticket. The statute requires that  they be that way and they weren   t. They had two different kinds, and  there was some kind of problem with it. You could still vote for anybody  you wanted to, and you could vote a straight ticket if you wanted to, but  not by just punching one ballot.  The case was tried in the district court   Knox Byrum was the district  judge, a democrat, who ruled for Henry. Said that Tulsa had violated the  law in not following that statute, but it didn   t change the election. People  that wanted to vote straight ticket, they could still vote. Henry carried  Tulsa County by, I think, thirty-some-odd-thousand votes. Ed  Edmondson wanted all those votes not counted. Had that been the case,  he would have won the election. They had to go to the Senate. The  Senate is the judge of its own members. He raised it there, too, but  Henry won it. That   s my story about Henry Bellmon.  Let   s back up a little bit. You said that when he first started, he didn   t  know what to do with his hands?  He didn   t. He was the worst public speaker you ever saw.  How did he improve on that?  He took lessons and he worked at it. He became as good a public  speaker as you   d ever hear. Maybe not as good as David Boren, but he  was a good public speaker. His first vote in the U. S. Senate was to raise  the pay of U. S. senators. He came back to Oklahoma City very shortly  after that and met with the Chamber of Commerce, Lion   s, Kiwanis and  Rotary Clubs. Somebody asked him about that vote to raise his pay. His  response was,    Well, I told you when I was running, I was going to take  care of the  farmers  and I took care of this one.    Everybody laughed  and it was never mentioned again. He had a really good sense of humor,  but he was not a good storyteller at the beginning.  When he had the Republican National Committee meet at the Skirvin, he  had Barry Goldwater speak to the luncheon. He introduced him. He was  state chairman. I introduced Henry. I didn   t know him socially, at all,  but the hallmark of Henry Bellmon was this incredible integrity. I  wanted to tell a story that illustrated that. So I said,    The other day, one  of Henry   s sons       that got a nice laugh that I didn   t appreciate   he  didn   t have any sons, he had three daughters,       asked him what was  meant by the meaning of ethical?    He said,    Well, I   ll tell you a story.  The other day, a fellow paid me a hundred dollars that he owed me.  9  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Gave me a brand new hundred dollar bill. After he   d gone, I discovered  he   d given me two hundred dollar bills stuck together. I had an ethical  decision to make.    Should I tell your mother?       Henry didn   t miss a  beat. He came up and he said,    The first thing I have to tell his mother is  about that son.    (Laughs) He was just something else.  If you didn   t know him socially at that point, did you later?  Much better. I made trips with him to the state capitol for a day with the  family in the limousine, which could pass anything on the road except a  gas station. That thing just ate gasoline. So I got to know the family  pretty well.  Were you there election night, when he was first elected governor?  No, but I can tell you a story about it that he told me. He was in Tulsa  and Bob Kerr came to see him. Bob Kerr was just an incredibly  powerful senator. He had national power. He was the guy we hated. It  would have been hard for me to be civil to him because that was the way  the land laid. He said,    Young fella, it isn   t often that you get dealt a  royal flush in politics, but you   ve got one. You can go as far as you want  to go.    Most gracious and truthful, I just couldn   t believe it. But no, I  was in Woodward. It was my election night, too.  I guess we should back up, too. How early in your life did you decide  you wanted to go into law or politics even?  My trip from San Francisco to Manila on ship was twenty-eight days.  They had the forerunner of paperback books on that ship   Armed  Forces editions, they called them. They had boxes of them. I picked one  up written about a lawyer named Perry Mason. I read all of them that I  could find and decided that I wanted to be a lawyer. I had been  interested in politics. I worked in Eisenhower   s campaign very little. I  was brand new in Woodward. That was when I got started in politics. I  was elected   I was appointed County Attorney for Woodward County.  Served for six months. Probably the most crime-free area in the world, at  that time. We had speeders. Went into the U. S. Attorney   s Office. I   d  never been in federal court. I   d never prosecuted a criminal case. I   ve  been very lucky and very fortunate, mostly thanks to Henry Bellmon.  That   s usually a good question,    How did his life impact yours?     Yeah, that was it. Henry asked me if I would be United States Attorney.  I didn   t even know what a United States Attorney was. I had a vague  idea, he was the federal prosecutor. Woodward was a marvelous little  town. When we moved there in 1950, it was 5,000 population. It had  10  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  been hit by a really terrible tornado that killed ninety-nine people and  injured two or three hundred. I didn   t know anybody there. We moved  out there. My dad thought that was where the state was going to grow.  The Bar kind of took me under their wing. I had been there a year and I  got called back into the Korean War. I had to be gone. When I came  back, the town wanted to help the returning veteran. It was a marvelous  place to practice law. You knew your clients in some relationship other  than the law. You knew them socially, many of them.  When Henry asked me if I wanted to be U. S. attorney, I told him,    No, I  wasn   t.    I had a good friend, a lawyer there, who had served as assistant  U. S. attorney much earlier. He asked me one day,    Who is going to be  the new U. S. attorney?    Because Nixon had been appointed   have to  have a republican president to have republicans appointed. I said,    I  don   t know. I guess I could have been.    He said,    What do you mean?    I  said,    Well, Henry asked me.       What did you tell him?    I said,    I told  him I wasn   t interested.    He said,    You don   t know what you just did.  You get a hold of him and find out if that job is still available and you  take it. You haven   t got any choice.    So I did. My family did not want to  move to Oklahoma City, four kids. But they did. Well, two of them were  in college by that time. My oldest daughter is a   Henry appointed her  district judge in Oklahoma City. She is going to retire next month after  three terms, three eight-year terms, as United States magistrate judge,  federal.  His arm reached a little further, huh?  Reached a lot farther.  People who know him are very loyal to him. Do you have an explanation  for that?  He was loyal to them. When Henry was in the Senate, early on, Nixon  wanted to close the Panama Canal to our navy ships. We had no  battleships that could go through it, they were too wide. Henry voted for  that and was called by Ed Gaylord, the publisher of the Daily  Oklahoman, the    Senator from Panama.    But that was the right thing to  do. He was just unerring in that respect. He was not without influence in  the Senate. Ed Muskie, democrat, good friend. Senate was different in  those days, too. They were all good friends. They   re not now, it doesn   t  look like. He was made for that. You know, the lord gave us George  Washington when we needed him and Abe Lincoln and Henry Bellmon  when we needed him.  Were you surprised when he didn   t want to do it again, run for the U. S.  Senate?  11  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Yes. I knew that that meeting wasn   t going to change his mind. He was a  little stubborn.  Just a little bit, huh?  Just a little bit.  Did you ever get to go to the farm?  Oh, yes, sure.  Do you have any Bellmon Belle stories?  My wife was a Bellmon Belle, of course. We   ve got pictures and still got  her dress   red, white and blue, and they had a hat. Bud Wilkinson ran  for the Senate and used that same kind of scheme. We called them Bud   s  Broads. Nobody else called them that, you understand. (Laughs) It was a  whale of a good idea. It worked. There are more women than there are  men, at least there were then. I don   t know what it is, now. They voted  for him. His opponent looked like he just stepped out of a band box  everywhere he went. He was dressed with a tie and cufflinks. Of course,  he was a very wealthy newspaper publisher.  The Oklahoman had a political reporter named Otis Sullivan who wrote  think pieces about politics. He did a story on each of the candidates and  when he talked about Bill Atkinson, he reported that he took two baths a  day. In contrast, Henry campaigned in his shirt sleeves on the back of a  flatbed truck with a Western band, no hat, no tie certainly, never. It  appealed to people. They could identify with him. It   s hard to identify  with Bill Atkinson, who also wanted a tax increase. Henry had  everything going for him in that respect.  Also, Atkinson had had a bitter, bitter primary with Raymond Gary. I  mean, it was war. They did not even speak to each other afterwards.  Raymond Gary supported Henry Bellmon in that election. Henry carried  every county north of Oklahoma City. Just draw a line across the center  of the state, he carried all those counties, and the county down on the  Red River where Raymond Gary lived. He carried that county. It was  just a remarkable election. He had a lot of things going for him, and they  all came together at the right time. That campaign cost about  800,000.  That   s nothing. I mean, today. Of course, that was a long time ago. Well   800,000 was more money, then, than it is now, but it didn   t compare  with today   s campaigns.  And you said yours was around  600   ?  12  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Mine was  600. (Laughter)  I don   t think you could get an ad in the paper for that, today, could you?  No, I had signs that   a friend of mine in my church got orange crates  and spray painted    Burkett for Legislature.    They didn   t cost me  anything. I had a radio   two minutes on the radio. I had probably ten or  fifteen of those. Not much.  Did you have a campaign manager?  No. I remember meeting with the teachers, telling them that I thought  that we ought to have school twelve months. I didn   t, I was kidding, of  course. It was a lot of fun.  Do you remember your swearing in day?  Oh, absolutely. I remember every time I   d drive  south  on Lincoln,  north of the capitol, I remember that day driving down there. Of course,  no dome in those days, but it was still very impressive, to me at least. I  remember that day very well.  Your thoughts when you were doing the oath? What was going through  your head?  I hoped I could not embarrass my electors. (Laughs) That I could do it. It  was a remarkable time.  Did any women serve with you?  There was one who served with me. Sat right across the aisle from me,  as a matter of fact, democrat.  Do you remember her name?  No, I don   t.  I should know it, too. What year was that?  In 1961.  That was before Hannah Atkins.  Oh, yes. I knew Hannah well, but not from that. Boy, there   s a  remarkable woman. She was a honey. She was just like Henry. Honestly,  13  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  her whole   she was never partisan. Never thinking,    I   m a democrat, I  have to do this.    She was just for the state. She did some good things.  Henry appointed me chairman of the Department of Human Services  Commission. We had a black senator, Vicki Miles-LaGrange, who  looked after our budget and took good care of us. Another good  democrat.  Was it Mina Hibdon?  No, that was after.  I   ll have to go back and look it up, then.  Pauline Tabor   My memory is just not that good anymore.  Where was your office in the capitol?  It was on the fourth floor. No, I take it back. It was on the fifth floor, and  there were five of us in there. We were in there early, we   d just gotten  there, and J. D. McCarty came around to introduce himself. He said to  me,    If there is anything I can do for you, let me know.    I said,    Well,  I   d really like an opportunity to go to Washington, D.C.    Well, two  months later, he appoints me to a committee to go to Washington for a  conference on hiring the handicapped. My purpose, I called Page  Belcher, my congressman, I said,    I want to be admitted to practice  before the Supreme Court.    You had to go up there, then. You can do it  by mail, now, but you couldn   t then. Page arranged it. Gosh, Earl  Warren, Felix Frankfurter, Hugo Black, all those honored names right  there. Quite a deal.  While Henry was serving as a senator, how much interaction did you  have with him during those twelve years?  I was U. S. attorney part of that time. Well, all of that time, really. I  guess Dewey Bartlett was elected while I was U. S. attorney. I met with  Henry and Dewey when they came back to Oklahoma City. I went to  Washington a time or two and met with Henry. I prosecuted the state  treasurer for tax evasion. Well, it wasn   t tax evasion. I wanted to make it  tax evasion, but we didn   t get that. He contended that Dewey Bartlett  was the reason he was being prosecuted. I never talked to Dewey  Bartlett about that prosecution one time. Didn   t convict him, either.  Tried him twice and he was acquitted. Got a hung jury the first time and  tried it again. But I prosecuted David Hall, who was a governor, and sent  him to prison for bribery while I was U. S. attorney. It was an exciting  time.  14  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Which job did you prefer that  U. S. attorney  over the legislature?  Oh, much. U. S. attorney was a marvelous job. I was in court every day,  practically, with judges who knew what it was all about. Knew better  than I, certainly. That makes a difference.  I noted that your degree is from OU, and Henry was a strong OSU fan     did you ever have discussions?  I probably know more Aggie jokes than anybody. Delighted to tell them  to him. He took them. He would say,    Now, no Aggie jokes.    This is a  really fine university. We   ve got two of them. Burns Hargis is a good  friend. As a matter of fact, he was chairman of the Human Services  Commission. He and Henry came to my office in Oklahoma City one  time. Burns wanted to run for governor, he did run for governor, and  Henry wanted me to take his place. I said,    How much time does it  take?       Oh, one day a month,    which was a deliberate lie, of course. It  takes more than that, but they wanted me to do it, and I did it.  So you didn   t tell him    No    on too many things, then.  You don   t tell the governor    No   . Not ever.  When he was governor, did you refer to him as that, or was it Henry?  Oh, no, it was Governor. Yes.  If your wife was a Bellmon Belle, can you talk a little bit about what she  did in that role?  They just campaigned door to door. That was the secret of the campaign.  Just in her county?  Oh, yeah, just in Woodward. Coffees and parties     Did she make her own outfit?  Oh, yeah. They all made their own outfits.  I   d read a little about the Bellmon Belles, but there is not much you can  find about them. It   s nice to hear a little bit about her.  Gosh, I think I probably have some pictures.  Did you go to the inaugural?  15  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Oh, absolutely. Henry was asked if he would serve alcoholic beverages  in the governor   s mansion. He said,    No, I might serve buttermilk        That was a joke. He didn   t even like buttermilk, but it went all over the  country,    Oklahoma Governor to Serve Buttermilk in the Mansion.    He  had a dance in the capitol building the night of his inauguration. It was  jam packed. I mean you couldn   t wiggle. It was so close.  Good times. Is there anything you can think of that people might not  know about Henry, that wasn   t common knowledge?  Gee. Nothing comes to mind.  Do you know how he made his decisions? I mean, what thought  processes and that type of things he did?  He was incredibly well-informed. He worked hard. When he commented  on a bill, he had read the bill. He had not only read the bill and knew  what was in it he knew what the impact would be. He had a lawyer with  him, Dale Cook, who was later a federal judge in Tulsa. Sharp as a tack.  He had some good senators, too. Bob Breeden, too, I remember from  Northeast Oklahoma. Those guys worked hard with him.  I   ll tell you something else, when he got elected, some of those people  didn   t think he was smart enough to be governor. A senator from  northwest Oklahoma I know, the man Henry had appointed chairman of  the highway commission and several others had the idea that they would  serve as his Board of Directors and he would be their executive, and  they would tell him what to do. I remember that the highway  commissioner was telling John Tyler, who was like this (gestures tight)  with Henry Bellmon, at a bar in Oklahoma City, the Skirvin Hotel Bar     we were there one night, the three of us. The fellow was sitting there  with his hand on the table, telling John Tyler how Henry wasn   t really  smart enough to be governor but he was well-intentioned and they would  serve as his advisers. John Tyler was smoking. I remember that he was  looking off, he wasn   t looking at the guy, saying    Really? Is that right?        Yes.    He took a drag of his cigarette and put it out on the man   s hand.  He said,    You burned my hand        Did I, now?    He was just furious at  this presumption that these guys had. It didn   t go anywhere. They didn   t  serve that way. He was the governor.  While he was serving as governor, would you have lunch and things like  that pretty regularly?  Oh, yeah. The day that Bud Wilkinson, the election in which he was  running for U. S. Senate, I had lunch with Bud and Henry at the  16  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  mansion. It was to fill a vacancy. Bob Kerr had died after being re-elected.  Howard Edmondson was governor. The governor appoints the  person to serve as U. S. senator until the next general election. Well he  resigned. It made George Nigh (the lieutenant governor), governor, and  he appointed Edmondson to serve as U. S. senator. The next election,  Edmondson ran and wasn   t re-elected. We had lunch and Bud was going  to have to go to Washington the next day. His term was starting  immediately, we were talking about that. He lost by 19,000 votes.  Goldwater lost Oklahoma by 79,000 and Bud lost by 19,000. He was a  very popular candidate. Everybody knew him. Everybody knew who he  was. You can take John Doe off the street and spend ten million dollars  on a campaign and more people would have known Bud Wilkinson. But  the Lyndon Johnson landslide   I think Goldwater carried seven states     killed Bud. It   s too bad, but that   s politics.  Do you think it took much persuasion to talk him into running for  governor the second time, when he came back from Washington?  No, I think he wanted to do it.  And he could have done a third term at that point.  He could have. By that time, he could be elected to succeed, but he  didn   t want to.  By that time, he would have been, what, in his sixties? Somewhere in  there?  A mere boy grown tall.  I would guess that he did a lot of his thinking on the plow or on the  combine or whatever.  No question. That   s right.  I understand he would take catnaps, power naps.  I have a picture of Henry. We went to Oklahoma Day at the World   s  Fair in New York City. Henry was sitting there next to a Tulsa oilman  who married a movie star. They   re sitting next to Henry. Walt  Helmerich. Henry is waiting, he   s going to speak, and he was sound  asleep. Sound asleep. I have a picture of it. I had to wake him up so he  could say his   yeah, he   d take catnaps. He was good at it.  Listening while he slept   I understand that he seemed to have a way of  comprehending what was going on around him even if his eyes were  17  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  shut.  Oh, yeah. Yes.  So you have four children. One went into law. What did the other three  do?  My youngest son has a law degree but he doesn   t practice. He sells  houses. My oldest son went to work for John Deere when he got out of  OU and worked for them until he retired a couple of years ago.  My youngest daughter lives in Norman. Her husband played football for  Barry Switzer. She has four kids, two boys. Her oldest son was  quarterback for Norman High School, got a scholarship to Wake Forest.  They redshirted him his first year and they changed coaches. He played  some the second year, but he   s a passer. He was a passer, and they  changed their philosophy so he left Wake, went to a junior college in  Kansas, where he had an outstanding career, and then he was recruited  by Nebraska. He was their quarterback for two years. He was Big XII  Offensive Player of the Year. Coached at Nebraska as a graduate  assistant, and then at Texas A M for two years, where his father-in-law  was the head coach. They are both now coaching for the Miami  Dolphins. Zac is the quarterback coach.  His not-so-little-brother, Press, played at the same junior college in  Kansas for two years, and then at Marshall. He was a quarterback. He  served two years as a graduate assistant, coaching quarterbacks at Tulsa.  The Philadelphia Eagles came down and hired him this year. He just  went to work for them. You know, the coaches in the Super Bowl were  brothers. We   ve got the same thing going.  All the way from Oklahoma. Well, do you have one or two favorite  Henry stories that you want to end with?  Gosh     If he was sitting here today, what do you think you all would talk about?  Probably J. D. McCarty. That was quite a deal. McCarty was the  ultimate politician. He knew what everybody in that room, house  members, what they wanted. If they wanted to be appointed committee  chairman, if they wanted whiskey, if they wanted a woman   he  arranged it. He was a consummate politician. We only met every other  year, in those days of the legislature. A lot of those guys were there  because it was four days away from Momma in the big city. They didn   t  read the bills, they didn   t pay any attention. Fortunately, I think, we  18  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  Finchum  Burkett  survived because there were leaders in there and they followed them and  voted the way they voted. It was a wonder to me that we did as well as  we did.  Henry, in his inaugural address, told them his motto was,    To forgive,  and remember.    I remember that. He did, he remembered. But he  accommodated a lot of people. In those days, that is what politicians did.  They accommodated each other. There was a down side to that, I   m  sure, but there was an upside to it, too. I had a dear friend across the  aisle, democrat, from Cherokee, Oklahoma in Alfalfa County. He voted  with us all the time, and I told him, he ought to be a republican. He said,     My party may leave me, but I   ll never leave my party.    His party did  leave him, and he became a republican. Not in the house, it was after his  time. It was a different time.  Integrity was the key for Henry.  What you saw was what you got. There was no fa  ade, no games. He  just didn   t do it that way. Remarkable man.  Well, if there   s anything else?  I think I   ve covered everything..  Well, he sure will be remembered.  He will be.  He has been with this project, too, so thank you so much for coming.  Oh, I   ve enjoyed it. I really have.  -------  -------
