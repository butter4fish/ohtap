 Little Thunder  Fife  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, April 28,  2014, and I   m interviewing Phyllis Fife, both of whose sisters are well  known Muscogee Creek artists. Phyllis you   re Director of the Center for  Tribal Studies at Northeastern State University where you   ve also taught  art and art history, directed the bilingual education program, and each  year you coordinate and issue Symposium of the American Indian, but  you are also a painter and clothing designer for Fife Collection Limited  which was one of the early Oklahoma Native clothing lines to really  break through to a national market. Thank you for agreeing to talk with  me today.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Okfuskee County, Oklahoma, in the Creek Nation. We  lived just a few miles north of the town of Dustin, Oklahoma, but in the  old Thlewarle tribal town community. The Creek church that we have  always attended that our family helped found is the Thlewarle Indian  Baptist Church, which is just about a mile from our house. That is the  community that I know as my home.  I know from talking with your sisters that your father worked for  Stanolind Oil Company  later called Amoco , and your mother was a  teacher. Starting with your father, how did he influence or encourage  the creative environment in your home?  Our father was very inventive, and he was very resourceful. He probably  taught us the value of saving any kind of materials that we might turn  into some type of creativity, something for use later. He also showed his  artistic talent from time to time. He didn   t purposely, I guess,  deliberately try to show us his artistic side, but we saw it come out.  5  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  When he did anything, whatever he created, whatever he built, he would  always do it with very carefully rendered skills. If he built something  from wood, he tried to make it look as finished as possible. Whatever he  did, even welding a gate, he didn   t like sloppy work, and he didn   t like  for us to do sloppy work.  How about your mother?  Our mother was, she was very creative, and we knew from a very early  age about her schooling and her education, starting from living in the  rural community just north of where we were raised. We were raised at  the home place where our father had been born and raised. Our mother  had been born across the river from him just about three or four miles,  although they didn   t know each other as young people. They both were  from large families and also surrounded by lots of cousins and aunts and  uncles. This type of environment is one that probably stimulates more  creativity. If you have any kind of artistic talents, then they   re going to  come out some way. We knew that our mother had gone away to school.  Both our parents had gone to boarding schools.  Our mother had  graduated as valedictorian at Chilocco, then went to an art teacher  training program at Santa Fe Indian School (1934), then on to Adams  State Teacher   s College. She taught art at Sherman Institute (Indian  School) in Riverside, California, then came back to attend the University  of Oklahoma.   Home and living in that rural community where   we had a creek in  front of our house, a creek behind our house, and on a day like today  when it was going to rain, we knew that when the rain was over and the  rain soaked into the ground that there was going to be clay on the creek  banks. Our mother really let us have the freedom and encouraged us to  try our hand at building things with clay. We tried our hand whittling out  of wood. We made things out of mud. We tried our hand at sewing and  cutting things, making things out of paper. Probably, we had the ideal  situation there with our mother and some of our aunts, also our uncles,  relatives.  And you also did some early beadwork?  I did, and I brought a piece to show you. When we were very young, our  mother taught us to do beadwork, and I can   t remember a time when we  didn   t have a lot of beads around the house. Of course, many of them  were all mixed up to where if you wanted to make a pattern, you had to  pick through the beads to find the colors, find enough of the colors. Our  father used to also bring us things to make artwork with when he could,  and so he brought home beads, too, from Tulsa where he worked.  6  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  When I was in about the fourth grade, I would say maybe nine years old,  my mother taught me how to bead on a loom  that my father made . This  is what I made, and I wore it to school really often. I made two  necklaces, actually. The other one was a different style that was more in  tune with what it was supposed to turn out like, but this was an early  experiment. A finished product, for me, that is a success if I ever have a  finished product. It was just something that I   ve kept over the years.  What is your first memory of seeing a piece of Native art?  (Laughs) Probably when I was born. I was born in the house that I was  raised in. I was born at home, and on the walls we had art. The earliest  piece that made a big impression on me, although we had some really  fine pieces of art by one of the Kiowa Five artists, actually, who was a  friend of my mother when she went to school at OU, the art that  impressed me the most, the earliest that I can recall was a mural that my  sister Carole had drawn with colored chalk on our old faded wallpaper.  The wallpaper, I think they said it used to be a pale pink, but when I was  born it was kind of a rich brown-looking color and a very good paper for  drawing with chalk, very porous.  Like I said, our father made us bead looms. He provided art supplies for  us. He, I   m sure, supplied that colored chalk for her, brilliant colors, too.  She had painted a whole mural on the wall. My mother said that she  woke up one day and there it was on the wall. (Laughter) It was a scene  of a village, like an encampment with people doing various things in the  village, and, of course, the fire with the black pot, black kettle on the  fire, and stacks of wood, and people carrying water, and kids running  around. I don   t remember   it was not preserved, unfortunately, and I   m  not sure a photo was ever taken of it, either, but that is the earliest fine  art (Laughter) by a famous artist that I can remember.  That   s great. What is your first memory of making art?  Well, I   m not sure what it was. We always had fabric, scraps of fabric  because my mother sewed and she had many   I remember we had  boxes, not just a little bit of scraps of fabric, but we had boxes of fabric  that were stored for use. She   d let us dig through the boxes of scraps and  get fabric out and try to make doll clothes. We tried all kinds of things,  the whole group of us. We were into collaborative art a lot, too. There  were eight siblings eventually, but I remember that we would try to  make   probably the first thing that I actually tried to make was a little  doll quilt, like a nine patch or four patch or something like that, sewing  squares together. Other than that, my beadwork when I was nine, that  was big accomplishment. When I was about ten, I was at school. My  teachers knew that I could draw and do artwork, along with my cousin  7  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Anita  Barnett , and so we were called upon if any artwork needed to be  done for anything in our school at the time.  I remember that I reproduced etchings that were in our textbooks of  portraits. They provided us with paint and poster board, and we got to  make a replica of the Great Seal of the United States, which we thought  was wonderful. In my mind it still was perfect. I   m not sure what it  really looked like. Those are just some of the early things. Probably  paper dolls. We used to have, like, Sears and Montgomery Ward  catalogs, and we were skillful enough to make paper dolls out of the  models in these magazines, in the catalogs, and cut out clothing to make  it fit. That was adaptive art. Other than that, we made things out of clay,  like I said, nothing that was permanent.  How early did you think of yourself as an artist?  Well, the word artist, I think, is way, probably, above me. I didn   t think  of myself as an artist at all. There were within my family, even of  siblings, there were various skill levels, the level of execution of what  we would maybe call art. I always aspired to be better at my skills and  using tools and materials that were at hand. I did, at some point, put on  my resume    professional artist    when I was sixteen years old at the  Institute of American Indian Arts. I was privileged to be selected to be in  some art exhibits, and as I began to sell artwork after I graduated from  high school there, eventually I used that title    professional artist.     How old were you when you went to the Institute?  When I went there, I had just turned fifteen years old. When I left, I was  at the end of my seventeenth year. I went to school there for three years.  I guess I was on the verge of being eighteen when I left.  What kinds of classes did you take?  We had majors and minors, and I majored in painting. I minored in  exhibition arts which was museum exhibition work.  Did you do any fabric design while you were there?  I did because Dr. Lloyd New, who was a fabric designer, recognized that  I designed clothing. I mean, we had to make all of our own clothes. I  don   t recall exactly when I first ever bought clothing because we, at a  very early age, started making   we learned how to sew when we were  very young. I remember in the seventh grade designing some of my own  things, some of my own clothing. I was pretty skilled at doing that. Mr.  New recognized that I had that skill, and he got me involved in some  8  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  fabric design. I didn   t major in that area of design, and I didn   t ever get  real good at silkscreening fabric. I watched the process, and he tried to  teach me batik. I didn   t understand what the process was going to be in  the end. I was hit and miss at it, no good. What he did, though, with the  fabric, the original designed fabric that was produced there, he gave me  access to the fabric to design some clothing, so I did that.  Now, at this point are you looking to Native traditions of clothing in  your design?  It was using   well, actually, no. The answer is no. It was contemporary,  everyday wear, something that I would actually wear, not something for  a runway show but functional clothing, something that would have kind  of an original   I liked the original ideas of design. I was able to use  some of the scraps of fabric and to create some pieces. That was just on  the side. I mean, it wasn   t in a class. We didn   t have a fashion design  program there, but we did have the fabric design.  Who were some of your classmates in terms of painting?  My classmates, I shared a studio with Earl Eder, Kevin Red Star, David  Montana. Linda Lomahaftewa was there at that time. T. C. Cannon,  Parker Boyiddle, Sherman Chaddlesone, Doug Hyde was there, Karita  Coffey, many of the artists that we know now, that are recognized in the  world of Indian art.  Did you have   was it whoever got to the studio first?  No.  How did that work?  Our curriculum was set up to offer us art studio classes half a day and  academic classes half a day. We had an academic building where we had  classrooms like any other public school, and then we had art studios. I  guess my first year we were given the opportunity to experiment to take  different classes for short periods of time to see what our interest was. In  our junior and senior years, I recall having my own studio area which  was kind of a cubicle in a studio, but a cubicle that was probably, (I   m  not sure what size) maybe eight by ten. We had walls, half-walls, in  between the sections, so we had a little privacy. We were given enough  time. It wasn   t like you had fifty minutes to work on your art and now  you have another class. We did have various art classes, too, that we  changed and went to. As time went by as we advanced, then we had  more studio time. I would say that it was when I went to college later  and lived on my own and had 100 percent studio time, that was a good  9  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  way to enter into that.  So what medium were you using most frequently? Were you painting in  acrylics mostly or oils?  I remember acrylics being introduced when I was in high school. I was  introduced to acrylics for the first time. Some of the pop art was  becoming popular, and colors were exploding into very vibrant colors. I  worked in all different media, but I had started out with water-based  paints and oil. Then I remember trying acrylics, and it just wasn   t the  same as oil paint. I did a little bit of both, and eventually I got more into  acrylic because of probably all the reasons anyone does. It dries fast, and  the colors are vibrant. I was working in   probably the style of art that I  eventually transitioned or evolved into was more of an abstract  expressionist type of what was called action painting at the time in the  art scene in California.  And you did go on to University of California at Santa Barbara     Yes.     to study with Howard Warshaw. What made you decide on that  program?  I had never considered University of California, and I had never heard of  Santa Barbara. Scott Momaday came to visit our school. He was an  English professor there at University of California at Santa Barbara, so  he recruited me to come to school there. He recruited all students, but I  was one who applied and got a scholarship. At the time, the school had a  reputation of being like a school without diversity, a school without  racial diversity, a school  where  90 percent students did not have  financial aid. They also had a pretty good-sized international program,  as well. The minority races of the United States were absent, and so a  scholarship program was developed. I went to school there on that  scholarship so my parents didn   t have to pay money. They sent me  money, and they probably paid for me to get there and back home. When  I went from rural Okfuskee County to Santa Fe, it was like going to the  moon, being in a totally different universe. Then going from boarding  school in Santa Fe to Santa Barbara to the beach party scene, (Laughs) it  was a totally different universe again, going from a 100 percent Indian  school to Santa Barbara on a scholarship for minority students, and there  were just twelve of us.  Total or from the Institute?  Twelve. No, I was the only one from the Institute. There were twelve on  10  Little Thunder  Fife  our program, on our scholarship program. The others were African  American from all across the United States. The next year, the second  year I was there I asked my roommate from Santa Fe, who was from  Washington, whose name was Phyllis Noyes, to join me at Santa  Barbara, so she came down and came to school there. Then there were  two Indian people there. (Laughter) I did meet a boy who was part  Apache who was already there. He wasn   t on the scholarship program.  We had the privilege of being mentored, I guess, at least kind of looked  after a little bit by Scott Momaday while we were there. She actually  worked for him as a student worker and did some clerical work on  typing his manuscript for  The  Way to Rainy Mountain.  I was working in the campus art gallery for my student job. I had the  experience of minoring in exhibition arts at Santa Fe, so the job that I  got in the university art gallery was really important because we set up  some really exclusive art shows from some of the best collections in the  United States. Stemming from the work I did at the gallery there, then  my supervisor hired me in the summertime, well, the whole crew of us,  to help set up exhibits at the Santa Barbara County art museum, which  was a really well known museum. I got a real good experience there.  The art program, the fine arts program, was good. Howard Warshaw,  who was my main advisor in art, was a muralist, so this gave me a  greater, different perspective on doing paintings and drawings. He had a  very good style, I guess, of three-dimensional drawing that was very  helpful in what I learned about form.  So how did your style change, do you think, after you left Santa Barbara,  or had it changed?  After I left Santa Barbara   I did a lot of life drawing in college there.  We hadn   t done much of that at all at the high school. I did a lot of life  drawing, and then really learning a little bit more about watercolor and  about mural art. Then when I came back to Oklahoma, I think I had a  freer style than I had had when I started out. When I was in high school  just experimenting with a lot of things, I used a lot of mixed media.  When I came back to Oklahoma, I think that mixed media technique  kind of entered in again, but I had a little more sophisticated style, I  think, more mature style in art, inspired by my surroundings and  availability of resources just like when I started out at the farm. (Laughs)  I often found myself with not enough money to buy art materials,  canvas, or stretchers, so mixed media entered in again. Some of the best  pieces, some of my favorite pieces are pieced together with wood mixed  with canvas to meet the dimension of a stretcher bar that I had. (Laughs)  I don   t know. I guess over time, anyone   s style goes through various  evolutions, and mine did, as well. I really think that probably from the  11  Little Thunder  Fife  beginning of my life, my creativity is most dynamic when I am limited  in what I have to work with and make that work.  So what led you back to Oklahoma? Did you think of it as a permanent  move? What were you thinking?  I came back when   about the time I left for Santa Barbara, my brother  left for Vietnam. Just being away from home, after having been away  from home already for three years at Santa Fe and one year at Santa  Barbara, that second year was particularly difficult for me. I also had a  health issue come up with an injury from playing softball in the  summertime that bothered me a lot. Just everything, it seemed like there  were a lot of personal stresses that second year that I went to Santa  Barbara. Always, as I was having fun walking down the beach or doing  something in sunny California with the most beautiful flowers I   ve ever  seen in my life, I thought of home. At the time, I thought my parents  were getting old very rapidly, I mean like,    Oh my gosh, my parents are  so old, and I won   t have much time with them by the time I ever  graduate from this university.    (Laughter)  Those types of things entered my mind, but it was somewhat, I wouldn   t  say difficult, but it was different living in a world where I wasn   t  surrounded by people of my ethnicity. I didn   t find any substitutes for  that anywhere. It made it more vivid in my mind the importance of that  community and the knowledge that my parents might have, just about  me being a Muscogee Creek Indian person, that I wanted to know. It  wasn   t that I didn   t know because I think probably before I went to  Santa Fe, I was well grounded in that. When I weighed the difference  between getting that education at the university in Santa Barbara versus  getting the education that I could at that community that I came from,  then the community became a little more desirable, important to me. My  father, once he told me that he wanted me to come home, and I was  saying,    Well, I   ll finish out. Let me finish out the whole year here.    He  said,    You need to come home.    I guess he told my mother, and my  mother enforced it. (Laughter)  They sent me a ticket home.   We were on a quarter system at Santa Barbara. We weren   t on semester  system, so I didn   t quite finish that second year at Santa Barbara. I came  home and stayed home for a few months. Then I got another  opportunity, and that was to get back into museum studies at Santa Fe. I  went back to Santa Fe, and I did that at the Museum of New Mexico.  Then what really brought me back home was, actually, that I got married  and married someone that I had met in Santa Fe years before. Now I   d  been gone for a while and came back and then got married.  I married  Don Patrick in Santa Fe at Baptist Indian Mission.  He was from  Oklahoma, too, and he had already kind of decided that he was ready to  12  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  move back to eastern Oklahoma. That was fine with me.  Were you thinking when you moved back to Oklahoma,    I   m going to try  to be a full time painter,    or had you already decided you wanted to  finish an art degree?  I knew that I needed to finish my degree, and that was my plan. When I  came back I probably   I can   t remember when I actually started back. I  went part time for a while.  At OU.  No.  Oh.  I took a few summer courses at NSU  Northeastern State University .  My sister was working on a teaching certification. She went to summer  school each summer, so I took a few courses when she did. Then  eventually, after taking few courses at NSU and a few courses at East  Central at Ada, then I decided that I   m halfway finished and I need to go  full time. That   s when I started to OU. It was several years later. I really  didn   t go full time right away. When I did start to OU, I stayed there,  and I took classes winter, summer, spring, year round until I was  finished.  Now, were you also exhibiting during this time?  Yes. I did exhibit work. This was something that was different, too, that  I had tried exhibiting, or I did exhibit at some shows in Oklahoma  during that time. I didn   t find the market the same as it was outside the  state. It was a very different expectation of our Native artists here at that  time.  Can you explain just a little more?  I would say that at the venues in Oklahoma that offered art exhibits,  what was at the time recognized as contemporary abstract art was  clashing a little bit with what was considered traditional Native art in  style. Some of the museums and galleries had restrictions that they  might only prefer the two-dimensional style, what was called traditional  painting, so my work was very different. One of the things, though, that  I did because my sister was very into that type of work and was very  good at it, was recognized, (she had won a lot of awards in that style and  did beautiful work) so I really did, at one point, I had the desire to see  what my work would look like in that style. We had some shows that we  13  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  were both in. I sold some work and won a few awards and have some  work in some collections.  Like at Philbrook or Five  Civilized  Tribes or     I did Philbrook and the Five Tribes Museum several times, Pawnee Bill  Museum, and it seems like there were some others. Just Oklahoma City,  there were several places in Oklahoma City that we showed our work. I  did that for a little while, and really you want to see what comes of it.  What your work, my work, I wanted to see what my work looked like in  that style, and I got some pleasure out of doing that type of work. It was  probably very limited to depictions of things that I knew from my  childhood or from my community. One thing in particular, a couple of  things I can remember in particular were paintings that I did in that style,  one at our cemetery. We had an elderly man who was so much of a  common presence at our churches and at funerals. He was always there,  so I did a painting of him at our cemetery. It was just from my memory  of him.  Then another time when   my mother and a couple of her cousins,  distant cousins, were very good friends, and they had been in beadwork  classes together. My mother used to teach beadwork classes. These two  women from Weleetka were elderly women, and they loved going to  beadwork classes. One of them was killed in a car accident. They were  together, I think. They had gone to buy some beads at a store in  Checotah and were in a car accident. One of them was killed in the car  wreck. At that moment, her face was so ingrained in my mind, and I did  a painting of her doing beadwork. Those were the things that I had seen  my sister do, also, things that were part of our everyday life, nothing  pretentious or nothing beyond what we knew as far as our traditions.  Anyway, those two paintings really had some deep meaning for me, a  kind of personal, personal meaning.  How did you end up going towards the idea of getting a master   s degree  in education?  Well, that   s a pretty good story, I guess. (Laughter) I got the degree in  fine arts at OU, and it wasn   t something that I   just the honest fact of  that degree was that I had had a very good education at Santa Fe at the  art Institute in art and also at Santa Barbara. I didn   t find it to be equal. I  didn   t find it at the same level, but I got that degree. That was the  important thing, to get the degree.  Right.  Then I just did artwork for about ten years, and as I was graduating from  14  OU, I got into the fashion designing business by accident. It was, again,     I think I will design a few pieces for myself just to see what my work  looks like.    I designed a few pieces, which led to more, which led to  people seeing them and people wanting to put me in this or that show or  getting me a custom order from someone. I found a good market in  doing that. For the ten years between graduation at OU and starting on a  master   s degree at NSU, I lived in Adair County. Ten years later I had  three little girls. I had a studio there with my sisters, the Fife Collection  Studio, and that was where some of the original designs originated. It  was right beside my house.  As time went by and we were into that business, I had to go back and  forth to Henryetta a lot or to Tulsa, and we traveled out of state. Our  business kept us pretty busy, and we all had our young children at that  time, my sisters and I. My husband was a school administrator. He was  at his job a lot. It was pretty demanding. I spent days on end talking to  my children, (Laughs) young, young children. One day in my studio I  decided   and they were totally involved from birth, their little swings in  the studio. I decided one day that I wanted to, I really had the desire to  have some intellectual conversations with someone in kind of an  academic world. I announced that I was taking some of the grocery  money and going over to NSU, which was thirty miles away, to enroll in  a class or two and see if I wanted to find a master   s degree program  there.  Actually, at the time there weren   t a lot of choices as far as master   s  degrees offerings at NSU. The one that I can fit into that I wouldn   t have  to backtrack too much was in education. It was curriculum and  instruction. I had done a little bit of teaching at NSU by then. I had  taught in the Continuing Ed program, some traditional techniques  classes to teach about fabric, fabric arts, and combining Native designs  on fabric. I had also done some teaching, adjunct teaching, in the art  department, just a class at a time. I had also used their studio. They had  set up a new etching studio with a new etching press, and I had done a  series of prints in that studio. I was a little familiar over there. I enrolled  in a graduate program, and I went through it pretty quickly because I  was a full-time mother and professional artist and designer. (Laughter) I  got the Master  in Education  degree  in 1987 , and I also went beyond  the master   s degree into school administration because at the time, if you  wanted to be a school administrator, you had to earn the master   s degree,  take sixteen hours above the master   s degree, and take a competency test  for certification.  I didn   t know that I wanted to do that, but I took the courses. I never  went beyond getting the coursework. I have the credentials, but I didn   t  ever act upon that. I didn   t really want to work in public school at all. As  15  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  I was graduating, as I was earning my degree and ready to go back to the  studio. I was offered a position directing a graduate teacher training  program in bilingual education. I accepted that offer at NSU, and I did  that for nine years. It was an administrative-type position as a director of  a program. That led to me working for, oh, five or six years in the  College of Ed, working with teachers, undergraduate teachers.  Meanwhile, I got the doctorate degree  in Education from the University  of Arkansas in 1994 . Both are in curriculum and instruction. I really  found value in my design background in the educational discipline or  field of curriculum, designing curriculum and designing educational  programs and designing instruction.  In what way?  The same way that I would do a painting or design anything. You have  your design elements. You have color, line, balance, depth, all of those  things that you have probably different terminology for them, but the  same design elements go into designing a good solid program for  whatever purpose it is in education. I would say even the color and  vibrancy have to be there, and especially today. There are a lot of  nuances that have to fall into place.  That   s really interesting. Well, just to pick up on your design firm just a  little bit, what was unique do you think about   or what is unique about  Fife  Collection  Limited?  The Fife  Collection ? At the time, the uniqueness was probably our  research that we did and discovery of Southeastern motifs that we really  did not see in any form of contemporary art at the time.  Were you seeing a little bit in pottery yet, or not really?  No.  Or jewelry? Okay.  Anna Mitchell probably was getting started about the time we were.  Some of the people who use that   I didn   t see it in the pottery that I had  seen. I was in the Southwest. I also was in the midst of a lot of people  who did contemporary abstract style designs in pottery, but I had not  seen any Southeastern or Mississippian Period designs in pottery at that  time, or jewelry. Knokovtee Scott came along kind of   he was  developing probably about the same time, too. Bill Glass. As far as what  we used in the Fife Collection, we knew that we used Seminole  patchwork. We didn   t try to create a new design of Seminole patchwork.  We tried to use the authentic original patterns that were created by  16  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Seminoles. We knew then and we know now, these are some traditional  patterns, original patterns of Seminole that are defined in a specific way  by the Seminole people and Miccosukees.  We know, also, that our tribe in Oklahoma has adopted Seminole  patchwork as traditional wear. That was, I guess, one of the attractions  that it had. It was something that was adopted and has become a part of  our culture, as well, but still giving credit to the original designers and  the original, I would say, engineers. If you   ve ever tried to make  Seminole patchwork, I would give credit to the Seminoles for the  engineering of Seminole patchwork. (Laughter) That   s something that  we adapted. It   s a beautiful, beautiful set of patterns that have meaning  for their clans but some for ours, as well. We used the Seminole  patchwork designs, and we used the Mississippian motifs, which we  can   t really claim unless they   re from the area where our people  originated in the Ocmulgee Mounds-Macon area. We can   t really claim  anything as exclusively Creek.  As a matter of fact, we are a confederation, so we are a diverse group  within ourselves. I would say that what we used in the Fife Collection  was something that we have some attachment to, something that has  meaning to us. We really didn   t try to exploit any traditional designs of  other tribes, except for the tribes that were in our family. With eight  siblings in the family, we have a large family, all boarding-school people  who have intermarried with different tribes. One of the things that we  did in our research was to become familiar with the design motifs and  styles for our children, the children in our family, for them to know, be  able to know the difference, that something isn   t generically Indian  unless it   s something like, I would say, what would be generic to all  Indians, something like maybe a blanket or a shawl but still with a tribal  motif on it.  I understand you had the tags on the outside of your fashions. Who came  up with that idea?  We did that on some of our things just because we liked our tags. We  made a lot of sketches because we belong to the Wotko clan, Wotkulke.  That   s the raccoon clan. We looked at reproductions of designs from the  Mound Period to see what we could learn about raccoons being depicted  in designs, and there were several. We each made sketches and looked at  them, and then Sandy is the one who refined our logo. We had some  woven labels made, and, of course, to order them we had to order a  thousand or something. (Laughter) I have three labels left, three. We  don   t have thousands of labels left, hundreds. We used them all.  Hold on to those.  17  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  They were   we liked the labels. The labels weren   t on the outside of all  of our clothing, but sometimes we would put them in a side seam where  they were folded. One side would say the Fife Collection, and the other  was our raccoon logo. One of the things that I guess I started was to sign  my designs in stitching on a skirt or a shirt, wherever it might be. That  was to distinguish mine from Carole   s or Sandy   s, Sharon   s or Robin   s  or our mother. Not everyone did that. Some of our things have  signatures, and some don   t, but most of mine do.  In terms of responsibilities, did any of you sisters   like, you would have  an idea for a design, or did you do most of the designing, or how did  that work out?  (Laughs) Okay, here   s how that worked out. Here   s how that worked  out. As I told you before, my last semester of college at OU, I had  started designing a few pieces. People were wanting to show my work,  and    Why don   t you design this and that?    My sisters, they really got  excited about it. They were saying,    Okay, and next why don   t you   .  You should make this.    They had wonderful ideas. Then I said,    Why  don   t you do it? We could all do everything equally.    So, it was,    If you  have that idea, you design it. You know how you want it to look. It   s  your idea.    That   s how the Fife Collection came about. It   s like ideas  grow. You start out with something and then get ideas for more and  more things. That   s really how the Fife Collection grew. It was,    No,  you design it.     I never liked sewing. I don   t like sewing. My mother loved sewing. I  especially do not like to do anything by hand, but I will. I would make a  prototype because once I had it in my mind what I thought it might look  like and I start to put it together, I can   t wait to see what it looks like  finished. When we did have our business, once we opened our business  and became incorporated, then at that point sometimes I could come up  with the idea and make a prototype. Then someone else could replicate  it, and I didn   t have to. We never did go into the mass production  business, although I guess we were probably, influences were headed  that way. We were a band of artists, I guess, band of designers. We were  a band of designers. (Laughter) We really hadn   t had business  experience, so we made a business plan starting out, made a business  plan. We had a portfolio. Once we did that, it was like when you write  your first r  sum   and say,    Oh, okay, this looks pretty good. I can build  on this.     We made a business plan, and when we decided to incorporate as the  Fife Collection, we did everything in an appropriate business fashion.  We stayed pretty well organized. We were like any other small business,  18  Little Thunder  Fife  especially one that doesn   t have one to model after. We pretty much  invented this business as we went along and expanded it and put revenue  back into the business. We had the business as a business for eight or  nine years, probably close to ten. We just operated it like a business, but  we also operated it as artists knowing that we could change our mind  tomorrow and not want to do that. Every day of our business, if we  wanted to, we could lock that door and walk away and not owe anybody  anything. That   s probably not smart, business-wise, but that was how we  did it.  You needed that space. Well, let   s talk a little bit more about your  processes and techniques as an artist. You   ve mentioned your media, but  some of the paintings that I   ve seen of yours have sort of a social or  political commentary. Can you explain why that   s important to you?  I can. I think that probably in my adolescence was a time of a lot of  move toward justice for minority people. There was a lot of political  undercurrent going on. We know today that artists have had a lot of  influence over time in telling this story or depicting some of the inner  workings of what   s going on, maybe just drawing on the emotions of the  viewer. During the    60s and    70s, I guess right before I went to Santa Fe  for school, I learned about, became aware of Martin Luther King. We  didn   t have a television, but we had some of the major magazines that  were informative, and the Tulsa World newspaper. There were a lot of  civil rights activities going on that were alarming, enlightening. I really  did like, admired the nonviolent movement of Martin Luther King. That  was somebody that had an early influence on my philosophical thinking,  I guess.  When I first went to school at Santa Fe, John F. Kennedy was  assassinated. That was some major national event that happened, and I  wasn   t home. (Laughs) I was away from home. I remember being in the  dining room at my school, and the postgraduate students were a lot older  than I was. I had just turned fifteen. I remember that they were so  serious and so emotional about it. Our dining room at our school was  family style dining, and they mixed the postgraduates with the  undergraduates. That also was something that struck me as being,    Here  I am, out in the larger world outside my community, and this is  happening.     Over time, probably when I was at OU, the American Indian Movement  was occupying Wounded Knee, and some of the early incidents of the  AIM movement had already taken place. I remember just how these  things affect   I always felt protected at home in my home community,  but as I heard about people who were becoming involved in the AIM  movement, or about meetings being held nearby, then these outer world  19  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  national things were affecting my home community that I thought was  always safe and protected from anything. It always seemed calm there,  so there was maybe a little agitation going on. I felt protective of our  elder people there that might not fully understand. Like I said, we didn   t  have a television. Some of the people that I knew, I didn   t know how  fully they were perceiving what was happening. Things were happening  pretty quickly.  Some of the things   I did an etching, a large etching. I really got the  image off of a photograph that was on the front page of probably the  Norman Transcript. I think I might   ve been at OU at the time, and Dee  Brown   s book Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee was kind of new at that  time. I made the title of my etching because it was an Indian man  holding two rifles, (he was down on his knees or something, holding two  rifles) had the inverted American flag, and there was violence happening  there. I titled that O Bury Me Not at Wounded Knee. Just something that  I hated for our people to have to go through, I mean anywhere, any of  our people. One of the recent commemorations that my sister had the  opportunity to go to was the Battle of Horseshoe Bend commemoration.  She sent back the photograph of the luminaries that were placed, one  representing each Creek that was killed in that battle in an open field at  night. Something like that is very touching, also that happened to our  people, closer to me than that other movement. Those are the things, that  is the way political statements get into my artwork.  Does sketching play a big role in your paintings?  Not necessarily. I did a series of large canvases, really large. I stapled  them to the wall, painted on them, and then I made a stretcher for them.  (Laughter) One of them in particular that I remember that was published  in   I can   t remember the name of the publication now, but it was a  publication of the Southern Poverty Law Center, I believe. I don   t  remember how it was selected to be in there. It   s been a while back. The  painting was called Canvas Ghosts. It was images that   this is how  some of my paintings evolve: from a blank canvas. Then as I began to  apply   maybe sometimes not applying anything to the canvas, but it   s  like images come forth. I begin working on that and working on those  images, and then they evolve. It   s not like I sketch out a painting and  then I paint it, ever.  Or even that you go in necessarily with an idea.  Right. It   s, like, not instincts, but there   s a word that I can   t think of  right now, not anything really deliberate     Intuitive.  20  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife     but something, yes, intuitive, that happens. Then I just build on that  until there   s a stopping place. That   s how many of my paintings evolve.  I remember that painting that I called Canvas Ghosts because that  especially was one that I liked that painting, and that   s how it evolved,  as well.  Do you find titles come easily, or are they challenging sometimes?  I guess my titles come pretty easily because probably by the time I get  into doing the painting, the title comes, as well. There might   ve been a  couple of times when I really was unsure, but I don   t think I   ve ever had  anything untitled. (Laughter)  What art project would you most like to tackle if you had the time?  I would still like to do some more etchings. I see so many commercially  produced, commercial reproductions of artists    work, and I still really  like the hand-drawn, original pieces. I would like to do a series of  etchings, and I would like to try some techniques that I haven   t ever  done before. One of the things that I really like   I don   t like all artwork  that is associated with computer-generated images or photographs stuck  to canvas, but I love the work of Bobby Martin. Bobby is Creek. He has  done some pieces using photo images either that are reproduced in  painting or now reproduced in print methods that I think really project a  lot of depth and really sincere depictions of our Creek culture.  That   s one of the things   he has invited me to come out to his studio.  He said,    I   ll provide the supplies. Just come out and do something.     That   s something that I kind of look forward to, and that would be new,  something new for me. A couple of years ago, we did the first exhibit,  museum exhibit of the Fife Collection, I mean, like, all of the Fife  family and some of our cousins. (Laughs) It was the first time, and as we  began developing that exhibit, it became more and more, there were  more ideas generated. It was like creating the piece of art as we were  putting it in place in the exhibit in the  Broken Arrow Historical   Museum. It could   ve been broken down into several different exhibits,  but that was the first comprehensive collection from our whole family  including our parents.  I saw it; I loved it. (Laughs)  It had the handmade wooden loom, bead loom. Our father made us all  one, all the girls, so we had one of those, and he made my mother   s  wedding ring. It really had the whole family. I would like to do  something similar to that again and maybe make it   I don   t know. I  21  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  won   t even say. I wouldn   t even say what I would want the outcome to  be because it would probably, (Laughter) it would evolve.  Be a multi-year project.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, looking back over your career so far, what was a fork in the road  for you, where you could   ve gone in one direction but you chose to go in  a different direction?  Fork in the road was when I went into education, got a job that paid a  regular salary that I could depend on getting on a regular schedule and  had health insurance and benefits and vacation, paid vacation. Fork in  the road from professional artist uncertainty depends on your stamina  and drive to keep going, and erratic paychecks. It   s something that I  don   t regret, but something that I see is another fork approaching, you  know, opportunity for fork in the road again, get back into artwork. That  is my dream.  We often, my sisters and brothers and I, often have talked about when,  (we all have had families and responsibilities and jobs) that at some  point we hope will change into an opportunity to do some things  together again. With my brothers, I have hopes of having them take me  places. One of the things that we have talked about doing is taking a  little tour of all of our land, our allotment land, various parcels of  allotment land, to take a tour. They go; they ride horses. Some of our  land is inaccessible. I want to be able to see all of that. Some of our  family have been down to our old homelands in Alabama, and I want to  do that, as well.  My sisters and I have, there are some things that we would like   we  have ideas that need that stopping place to,    Oh, let   s see what those  ideas look like in reality again.    We   ve talked about doing some projects  together, and now some of our offspring are into art. One of the things I  would love most is to do some projects with my daughters. All three of  them are very good artists and all different. I   d like to do things with  them and with my nieces and nephews, as well. Those are just a few of  my dreams for my future.  Lots of things to look forward to, that we   ll look forward to, too. Is there  anything else we need to talk about or you   d like to add before we look  at your artwork?  I probably would think of something after we stopped talking that   s  important to me.  22  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Well, you were inducted (I   ll just mention this) into the Mvskoke   Muscogee  Hall of Fame in 2013.  That was a shock. It was a surprise, and it was very much of an honor  for me because something   I feel very insignificant when I think about  our tribe. To me, it   s a pretty large community, and insignificance is  good. Insignificance is very good. I like being one of the people. This is  something that had not been something I aspired to, but when it was  brought forth and became a reality for me, then it was a very great  honor, a very great honor.  Well, we   re going to take a pause and look at some paintings and  artwork.  All right.  Phyllis, would you like to talk about this painting just a little bit?  I did this painting in 1982.  Wow.  I   ve had it for a while. It   s one of those paintings that I just started out  with some paint on canvas, and then it developed into having some  images. I titled it Rain in the Clouds Below Me. That kind of was  inspired by when you drive from Santa Fe down to Albuquerque, you  can be above the clouds and see it raining down below. I don   t know  what about the painting led me to that, but that   s its title. I guess  mountains and clouds in the background, but images in the sky, also.  Love that. And this is an example of one of your more mixed media  pieces, I guess.  Yes. This one is one that I did just probably a couple of years ago. Kind  of again, it   s inspired by Bobby Martin   s work with photography, but I  used a natural paper to develop the image of my grandmother, Louisa  Fife. This is one of my favorite pictures of her because this is the way  she looked in her everyday style of dress, and this is the image that I  have in mind when we think about traditional Creek women dressing.  Growing up I used to see, and we used to do this, too, actually when I  was little, carry our coins tied in the corner of a handkerchief, so that is  what I related to my grandmother   s time. I guess she actually died when  I was two years old. I think I remember her, but I might remember her  from people talking about her and seeing some of her items of clothing,  some of her possessions in my early life. That   s something that I  23  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  Fife  Little Thunder  constructed with the handkerchief and her photo image.  Wonderful. How about this piece?  I was asked to do an illustration for the story about the origin of clans of  the Muscogee people. I guess it was a really early morning start on this  painting for the illustration, just using some knowledge about  Muscogean motifs and then images of animals that are part of our clan  system. This illustration is in the permanent exhibit about Muscogee  Creeks in the Broken Arrow Historical  Museum .  The blues and browns are just really effective on there, too. This is a  different medium here we   re looking at.  This is a drawing, I guess, with graphite and a little bit of watercolor in  the background. Probably something stuck on, I think there   s some  paper image attached to the surface, as well. That was something that is  not unusual in my work. It   s called Dream Painters. When I did this, it  was kind of like thinking back on the studio that I shared with some  other painters at Santa Fe. We were very young and just starting out. I  had a   I don   t know. I   m not going to name names, (Laughs) but some  of the people I shared studio with.  All right. Well, thank you very much for your time today, Phyllis.  -------  -------
