 Little Thunder  Berryhill  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, September  20, 2012, and I   m interviewing Les Berryhill as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Les    home in Edmond,  Oklahoma. Les, you were Athletic Director at Rose State College in your  pre-retirement life, but you began your bead art in the late    80s. Since  then, your work has garnered a lot of attention and a number of  important awards, and you   re now working full-time on your art. Thank  you for taking the time to talk with me.  Well, thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Yes, I was born in Talihina, Oklahoma, the Indian hospital there, which  is no longer in operation. I   ve gone back a couple times to look at it, and  that   s where I was born. My mother   s sister was a nurse there, so I was  born in the Talihina Indian Hospital. I grew up in Coalgate, Oklahoma,  through my sophomore year. Then my junior year, I moved to Atoka,  about fifteen miles from Coalgate and went my junior and senior year at  Atoka high school, and graduated from Atoka High School in 1962.  What did your mom and dad do for a living?  My mother was a dietician there at the hospital in Atoka, did that for  years until she retired. My father was a city employee in Coalgate and  worked for the city until he retired.  How about either set of grandparents? Did you have a relationship with  them?  Yes, when I was quite young I lived with my grandmother, when I was  5  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  about four, maybe five years old, and she raised me. We had two other  older cousins that lived there, also. We were at Picket Prairie, which is  near Sapulpa and Mounds. I have some very fond memories of growing  up there. Of course, she spoke the Native language, and I still remember  a few words that she would say to us.  She spoke Euchee or Creek?  She spoke Euchee. Really enjoyed that. Then my mother married my  stepfather. They came and got me when I was about five and a half, six  years old. We moved to Coalgate, and I started the first grade in  Coalgate, Oklahoma.  So this grandma is your maternal grandma.  Yes, maternal grandmother.  Were you brought up around the ceremonial grounds or church or both?  No, not really. I can   t remember much about that. When we moved to  Coalgate, did not follow the Native American history, culture too much.  Got into sports and athletics and mostly focused on that. People have  asked me about that in Coalgate, and I don   t recall being a Native  American in Coalgate. I was just another one of the boys there.  Did any of your family or extended family bead?  No, no one that I remember did artwork, and not beadwork, for sure.  Some of them may have drawn or did some painting, but I don   t recall  that at all. None of them did that, so I was not influenced at all by my  family.  So you   re both Euchee and Muscogee Creek? Which influence was  dominant?  Well, actually, I   m Euchee, and we   re on the Creek rolls. The Euchees  were brought here in the 1830s with the Creeks. There   s a couple of neat  stories about how the Euchee were adopted into the Creek family. We   re  on the Creek rolls, but we   re Euchee and not actually Creek.  When did you see your fist piece of Native art?  Well, I kind of remember when my son was young   he was born in  1970, and when he was young, we would go to Santa Fe to ski. He  learned to ski in Santa Fe and Taos area. He was probably in his teens  when we were out there, and probably in the    80s, mid-   80s, we went  6  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  into Morning Star Gallery up on Canyon Road, which is a well-known  gallery in Santa Fe.  They had a collection of Native American knife cases, beaded knife  cases, that Native Americans from the late 1800s  made . They had  purchased that from San Francisco, and they had about forty. I just fell  in love with them. I   d never seen them before, and I did collect old  knives. I   ve always had old knives and a collection of old kitchen  knives, butcher knives.  I looked at all of them, as I remember. As I picked up one and I looked  at it, the least expensive one that I found was three thousand dollars at  that time. That was quite expensive, and I thought,    Wow, couldn   t  afford one of those.    I remember thinking,    I   ll just go home and make  my own.    (Laughter) So I decided to go home and bought some bead  books, talked with some other bead artists and other artists, and began to  make knife cases.  My goal was to make twenty knife cases and put them on the back of the  wall like I saw there in Morning Star and just be happy, and then my  wife said,    Why don   t you go to some art shows?    Of course, being  naive, I said,    And do what?    She said,    Well, people will buy these.  They   ll love them  They   re wonderful.    I said,    Really?    She said,     Yes.    So, I began to, about twenty years ago, get into art shows.  Going back to your growing up years, you didn   t get a chance to see any  Oklahoma Indian painting?  Well, yes. I recall in Coalgate the post office there, and most of the post  offices at that time, the WPA  Works Progress Administration  hired  Native American artists to draw panels on the wall. There was an Acee  Blue Eagle panel in the Coalgate post office. It was a family scene. They  were out on the farm, and there were chickens, and the father and the  mother and the children were standing around. That impressed me. I  really enjoyed that. Acee Blue Eagle, of course, is a well-known famous  artist. I recall that vividly and have been back several times and taken  pictures of it since then.  Did you do any sketching or drawing or painting when you were little?  No, I can   t remember doing any sketching or artwork or drawing until I  got to college. I did take one art class, just a drawing class, and really  enjoyed that. I saw that I was a little bit good at doing it, and I   ve made  some drawings since then. My wife keeps telling me I should go into  painting or artwork, drawings, but I   m too busy in my beadwork now to  learn another art form. (Laughter)  7  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  So you really didn   t have exposure to art or art classes in primary or  secondary school that you remember?  No, not that I remember. Probably had some art classes, but I can   t  remember them.  Is there any other kind of art experience outside of school that might   ve  impacted you when you were younger?  No, I don   t recall anything other than nature itself influencing you, how  things are in nature. Of course, Native Americans are very spiritual and  into nature. I think that influences a lot of people and probably  influenced me a little bit, growing up in southeastern Oklahoma. We had  a lot of trees and a lot of ponds and things like that.  Let   s talk a bit about your high school days and your interest in  athletics.  Okay. I think I, from a very young age, was always pretty athletic. I  think the coaches recognized that, (most of the coaches do) so I began to  do sports in high school and junior high and did everything. I ran track,  played baseball, football, basketball. Whatever the season was, I did it.  Then when the season changed, I changed also. I think when I was a  sophomore, I went to state in track.  What was your event?  I ran the 440-yard race. Now it   s the 400 meters. It was 440 yards at the  time. Then we moved to Atoka, and they did not have track, so I quit  running track. I high-jumped and did some things in high school at track  meets, but Atoka didn   t have track. They had baseball, so I started  playing baseball. Of course, played football and basketball there at  Atoka. Made All State my senior year as a leading scorer in football and  had scholarship offers to University of Oklahoma in football.  Bud Wilkinson offered me a scholarship to play football, and then Mr.   Henry  Iba offered me a basketball scholarship to play basketball at  Oklahoma State. Then when I went to Oklahoma State, after maybe  about two years, the track coach there, Ralph Higgins, came to me. He   d  seen me run in high school, I guess, and he wanted me to come out and  run track for him at Oklahoma State, but after playing basketball for a  season for Mr. Iba, we were pretty tired. We wanted to relax and rest a  little bit. (Laughter) I told him I wasn   t interested in that, but I ran  intramural track and things like that.  8  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  They would   ve let you do both sports if you were interested?  I think so, yes. Mr. Iba would   ve let us do two sports.  Can you talk a little bit about arriving in Stillwater at Oklahoma State  University from Coalgate? You   d been basically recruited to play  basketball. Can you talk about your first experiences?  Yes. At that time, I had not traveled a great deal, and so it was a big deal  to go to Oklahoma State. Like I said, my mother and I, she took me to  OU for a recruiting trip, and she took me up to Stillwater, and they  dropped me off. It was kind of unnerving a little bit for a small-town boy  to be in Stillwater, but I enjoyed it. The students there were wonderful.  The instructors there were wonderful. I really, really enjoyed my time  there, and I think Oklahoma State   s a wonderful university.  What do you remember most about playing for Mr. Iba?  Well, at that time, freshmen were not eligible for varsity, so we had a  freshman team, and we had a very good freshman team that year. I  started on the freshman team. Then the next year, sophomore and junior  year, my junior year we won the Big Eight, which back then was the  eight teams in the conference. Now it   s changed quite a bit, so I don   t  even refer to the Big Eight anymore because people, most of them, don   t  know what that is. (Laughter) We won the Big Eight in 1965, my junior  year, and then I started again my senior year, so I started two years at  Oklahoma State: freshman year on the freshman team and then my  senior year. Really, really enjoyed it.  We   ve all been very active and very involved with Oklahoma State  athletics since then. We   ve done      65, we had a forty-year reunion. We  had a committee here of four or five guys that did the reunion, set it up,  and they were very helpful at Oklahoma State for us to do that. We  invited back all the players that played for us in 1965. I emceed it. As  you might know, liking to talk, they wanted me to emcee, so I got to  emcee all this and got to talk a lot. (Laughter) We had the microphone,  and we passed it around and talked. We just had a wonderful, wonderful  time. My wife attended, and all the wives attended, and it was just really  wonderful. That was such a unique experience.  Later, we decided to have a    Men of Iba    reunion a couple years later  and invite back all the men that played for Mr. Iba. We did that and,  again, the same committee. We set it up and organized it. All the players  came back that were able to except for Bob Kurland. Bob Kurland was  living in Florida at that time. He   d been an All American for Mr. Iba  back in the mid-   40s after the war and had won two national  9  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  championships then. We really, really enjoyed that.  I probably got more satisfaction out of doing that reunion than I did even  our own reunion because the people were so grateful. They   re getting  older now, and they   re not able to travel, and some of them are leaving  us, so we were really, really proud to do that last one. Then we   ve done  one or two other just weekend things here. We met here in Edmond and  went to a basketball game for the All College. We   ve done that. We   re  still quite involved. There   s a number of us here in Oklahoma City that  were on those teams. We played for Mr. Iba, and we meet annually,  maybe once a month, two months, have lunch, and tell those Mr. Iba  stories and embellish them and make them up. (Laughter)  You did take a drawing class while you were at OSU.  Yes.  What was that experience like, because you really hadn   t explored  drawing before, I guess.  No, I hadn   t. I just recall it being very interesting. It seemed like a small  class. I don   t remember how many were in the class at the time, but we  did mostly with pencils. It was teaching you depth. Draw a stool so that  you could see the depth of the stool with three legs or four legs or  whatever, and a rope. I really, really enjoyed it and don   t remember that  much, but I think I got a good grade. I don   t recall the exact grade that I  got, but I think I got a pretty good grade in that class.  Did you continue to sketch a little bit or not?  No, I really didn   t. It didn   t affect me that much. Since I   ve been  beading now, I   ve done some sketches of the different Native American  chiefs. Some of them, I think, are quite good, but I didn   t do anything  after that. I was too involved with athletics, and we kept busy during the  season.  You got your degree in     I majored in history and took history classes, and I think at the time it  was social sciences or social studies. My bachelor   s degree was in that.  Then I got married and went in the service, active duty at Fort Polk,  Louisiana, and came back and got a job here in Oklahoma City. Then  started working on my master   s at the University of Central Oklahoma.  What were you doing in Oklahoma City for your job?  10  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  I worked at different places. After I got out of the service, I worked at  Star Spencer and different high schools. I taught at high schools and     History?  Yes, taught history and geography. I really enjoyed that, at Star Spencer.  Then I worked a couple years at Putnam City. I was at Putnam City High  School. Worked there for two years, and then went back to Oklahoma  State as an assistant coach in 1970. Mr. Iba had retired, and Sam  Aubrey, who   d been his assistant for many years, hired Cecil Epperly  and I as his assistant coaches. We were up there for three years as  assistant coaches and coaching and did not have to do any teaching, just  recruiting and coaching.  How did you like that?  It was quite an experience. It was really interesting. Outgoing, so I  really, really enjoyed it, enjoyed the people, enjoyed the organizations  and speaking at different rotary clubs and things like that, and going out  to recruit, travel. I had the eastern part of the United States, and Cecil  had the western part of the United States. We recruited, and it was fun.  We really, really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a great deal.  Had you had an interest in antiques prior to walking into that Santa Fe  gallery when you saw that knife collection?  Yes, I kind of always liked antiques.  How did that develop?  I don   t know where it came from. As a young boy (I think most young  boys like knives, pocket knives, and things like that) I began to collect  old butcher knives and kitchen knives. That was the knives that the  Native Americans used to put in their beaded cases, so I had those  already when I saw the beaded knife cases. I had collected artwork,  some artwork, and bear claw necklaces     Some Native artwork?  Yes, Native American artwork and some peace medals, Native  American peace medals that represented the Native Americans when  they signed a treaty. Really enjoyed those and some artwork and some  weapons, bow and arrows and tomahawks and things like that. I  collected some of those things prior to getting into actual beadwork.  Then about that time, I got into my beadwork, after Santa Fe, after I saw  that.  11  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Let   s talk about that. You decided you could go home and make some  beaded knife cases, yourself. How did you approach learning how to  bead?  Like I said, I had no idea other than I purchased some paperback books  that show you how to do beadwork and then began to try to learn how to  do it. I would talk to other artists, other beadworkers, or other artists,  period, about how to get into shows or things like that, the timing on it.  Really enjoyed doing it.  I got a couple of patterns down that I liked in my knife cases. Like I  said, my goal was to make twenty knife cases, and probably over a  couple of years, I made twenty beaded knife cases. Some were leather  with beads on them, and some were all beaded. Put my old knives in  them. People began to collect them and like them and would come back  each year, which was very surprising to me.  My friend began to tell me that people who like your artwork, they   ll  come back next year and buy another piece. There   s a man by the name  of Mr. Wilbur, who lives near Wichita Falls, Texas, he came every year  and would purchase a knife case. He probably had more than anyone  else of my knife cases.  Now, what show was this at?  This was in Santa Fe, Santa Fe Indian Market. I continued to make knife  cases, and I did that for four or five years, I guess, and then began to  branch out and do other things. Now I probably bead half a dozen, six or  eight, different items, different things that I do. Began to make Native  American blankets, Navajo blankets. Beaded those for several years.  Began to make wooden implements. Read a lot and saw (would go to a  lot of museums and get patterns and things) that the Native Americans  beaded wooden implements and metal implements, kitchen items like  that, so I began to do that, and then I did some bottles.  My wife said,    Why don   t you make some perfume bottles? Women like  perfume bottles.    Native Americans beaded perfume bottles, and so I  began to bead perfume bottles. Then I got into animal skulls. I did bison  and a couple of deer and an elk and really enjoyed that. It   s just kind of  progressed into different areas. The latest thing I   ve been doing is  making beaded fish, trout. A lot of people like to fly fish, so I recently  did a fly fishing trout and beaded it and named it The One That Got  Away. People liked that. (Laughter)  One of your bead pictures.  12  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Yes.  As you were starting out, were there any beadworkers that you admired,  especially? Did you ever go to anybody for a little bit of problem  solving?  Don   t remember talking to too many. Like I said, it seemed like I was  self-taught. I think many of them were very helpful when I did ask  questions. Of course, artwork, like athletics, is very competitive, but  most of the people at that time when I was going to Santa Fe weren   t  doing traditional work out there. There weren   t but about a dozen  beadworkers in Santa Fe at that time, and a lot of them did cigarette  cases and pens and things like that, tourist-attraction-type beadwork.  Then there were some that were doing the traditional work, which is  what I like, too, and I began to get into bags and knife cases and things  like that.  There were not that many beadworkers in Santa Fe at that time. There  were more beadworkers here in Oklahoma, probably, in the Plains area,  than there were in the Southwest. It was not a big artwork, but now it   s  very, very big. It   s grown now to   we have our own category now in  Santa Fe Indian Market in beadwork. Of course, a lot of people do  quillwork, but it   s really taken off. A lot of the young people are starting  to do beadwork now. At the time, it was maybe becoming a lost art. Not  many people were beading at that time, but now I think a lot of the  younger people and grandchildren and children are beading, which is  great. It continues the art form.  It   s so ironic because Santa Fe is kind of like the apogee of Indian art  shows, and so the first show that you really applied to do and got  accepted to right away was Santa Fe Indian Market. Is that correct?  Well, actually, I did a couple of shows here locally. Did Red Earth first.  Red Earth was the first show that I did. Red Earth was the first show.  Then Yvonne Kauger, Supreme Court judge, had a show at her home  here in Edmond and then up in Colony, Oklahoma. I got into that show  and began to flex a little bit and see what was going on.  Everyone said,    Well, Santa Fe is the world series of artwork, so you  need to get into Santa Fe.    Well, I applied. Of course, at that time, they  said,    We have over a thousand artists at the Indian Market there, and  many, many more than that apply. It would take five years before you  could get your own booth.    They said,    You were accepted.    They liked  my beadwork, and I was accepted, but you couldn   t get a booth. They  sent me a letter back and told me that, but then they said sometimes  13  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  people will share with you.  I had met some friends at Red Earth from out Southwest and began to  share a booth. Jose Toledo, who is a watercolor artist, well-known, won  many awards out there, lives near Durango, Colorado, now. He offered  to share a booth with me. I met him here at Red Earth, and for two years  I shared a booth with him. He let me share a booth. He has a niece,  Alvina Yepa, who makes pottery. She   s a well-known potter, too, that  has won awards in Santa Fe. She let me share a booth with her for two  years.  Then just like clockwork, on the fifth year, I got my own booth.  (Laughter) Then I said,    I will always share with someone,    so Danny  Worcester, who makes knives, and I have been sharing a booth.  Sometimes he would get the booth, and sometimes I would get the  booth. We   ve always shared with each other, about the last fifteen years.  So your first year at Santa Fe Indian Market was what year?  It was 1992.  So you   d been beading for about four years.  Yes, three or four years.  When you were working on your knife cases, where did you get your  designs?  Like I said, Pat (my wife) and I would go to a lot of museums, and I  would make sketches there, which, again, goes back to my   maybe the  first class I ever took at OSU was a sketching class. I would sketch and  take the colors and the patterns down. And, of course, I would purchase  books, paperback books and hardback books, that had Native American  beadwork in it that would show me the patterns and the color  combinations and the different tribes and so forth and the style of  beading. I began to do that and really enjoyed that.  When you   re first starting out, in terms of getting your supplies, you  don   t always know where you can get the best deals or the biggest  assortment of beads to look through. How did you get your supplies  when you started out?  Yes, that   s another thing you had to learn from other people. Where do  you buy your beads and that type of thing? At the time, there were a  couple of places that had beads, and they had catalogs, and you could  order them from there. Then there   s another place in Texas now that has  14  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  beadwork. There   s one here in Bethany that sells a lot of beads. As time  went on, people began to open up little shops.  There used to be one here in Edmond that sold beads. Of course, the  beadwork now is not necessarily focused on Native American traditional  beadwork but contemporary beadwork for necklaces and all kinds of  beads that they do, make pins and hat pins and everything, not  necessarily Native American.  Most of my beads are from the companies that provide them. There   s  one in Colorado, too, that I buy a lot of beads from. They come to the art  shows, too. Those people that sell things that Native American artists  can use will be at the art shows. It   s mostly at Red Earth and the other  art shows. They   ll be there, and so you can purchase your beads from  them.  Although, as you mentioned, there weren   t a lot of beadworkers out in  Santa Fe when you started, we had a lot of Oklahoma beadworkers. I   m  wondering what set your beadwork apart from other beadworkers   .  I don   t really know what that would be. Someone else would probably  have to define that. As I see it, I started off just with the knife cases and  bags, different bags, because those were very popular at the time. I made  quirts, riding-horse quirts, the whip they would use when they were  riding horses.  Was anybody else doing cultural items like quirts?  I did not see that many. Most of them were doing, maybe, little dolls.  They were doing vests and shirts and jackets and cradle boards, that  nature. Bags were really popular then, and so I did all those traditional  things early and then began to branch out and do different things and did  some things that other people weren   t doing at the time.  I still think I   m doing some things that no one else is doing. For  example, the beaded Navajo blankets, I began to do those. I just really  love those, and they were very, very popular and still are popular. I  haven   t done many in a few years, but I   m kind of wanting to get back  and start doing that.  And the wooden utensils, I don   t see many wooden utensils. People still  stick with what they began to first do, but I began to branch out and do,  like I said, about a half a dozen different things. I do spurs and keys  now, the old big Mexican keys, and the old Mexican spurs with big  rowels on them. They had branding irons. They called them saddle irons  at the time. You could make candle holders out of them if they stand up  15  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  straight, and I began to bead those.  I really began to branch off and do different things that I didn   t think  other people were doing. When people come by the booth now, they   ll  comment that these things are quite different. In fact, the best  compliment that I get on my beadwork when they come by Indian  Market is that they   ll say,    Wow     Then pretty soon her husband will  come by and say,    Wow  And I say,    Wow.       Oh, that   s good.     (Laughter) I   ll say,    Thank you. Do you collect beadwork?    They   ll say,     No.       Do you like beadwork?       No, but this is wow  This is totally  different than anything out here     I   ll say,    That   s the best compliment  I   ve had all day. We laugh and talk about that.  You mentioned that you were making some of your wooden items that  you bead, or not?  No. I just find the old or antique ones. They need to be older and used.  Maybe Grandma used them. Some of them are newer. I   ve had people  say,    Make me a new one so I can use it.    Most of them are antique,  whether they   re knives or the old kitchenware, forks and spoons and  knives, and military knives and spoons. Then the old wooden items,  mashers and wooden spoons and forks and things like that.  What was one of the first awards that you won in beadwork?  Probably in Santa Fe. I think it was the first deer skull that I made. I  beaded a deer skull, and it won second place, I believe, in Indian Market  several years ago. I believe that was the first piece that I actually won  and received a ribbon for.  How did that feel?  It was gratifying and really, really very nice. They always give you a  little check for doing that. It was nice. I remember being pretty excited  there at Indian Market. A friend of mine and I were walking around, and  we walked up and saw the prize there on my deer skull. I was pretty  excited at the time. I think we went out to dinner that night and  celebrated. (Laughter)  Did you have collectors in front of your booth early in the morning?  Well, my booth mate does. He makes knives, and he is just amazing.  He   s won about ten years, ten or twelve years out there. His customers  are there at six o   clock in the morning when we   re setting up. Not many  are coming by to see my work at six o   clock in the morning.  16  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Even that year that you won the prize?  No, not really. It sold. A lady from Texas purchased it, and that was  nice. But I think beadwork is in a different category than other things. I  think Danny, the knife maker, has probably a dozen, twenty people that  collect his knives, and they just wait until each year to collect his knives.  His knives are beautiful. They   re wonderful.  Have you ever beaded any of his knives?  Yes. He retired about a year ago, and I took the pattern of one of his  knives, and I beaded it for him and framed it and presented it to him on  his retirement. He was quite moved. I think it was really well done, and  he really, really liked it. The next year I retired, and he made a knife for  me, Indian corn knife handle, and gave it to me as my retirement. We  enjoy the knives.  That   s wonderful. You mentioned traveling to museums occasionally and  sketching. What are some of the places that you travel for research?  We travel a lot. The Native American museum in Washington, DC, is  fabulous. It   s wonderful. It   s a new museum there of Native American  culture. I think probably in Oklahoma here, we probably have more  museums that feature the Native American artists, and I just think  they   re wonderful. When people come visiting, we always take them to  these museums.  Of course, the Cowboy Hall of Fame, or the  National Cowboy and  Western Heritage Museum . They changed the name of it. The  Woolaroc Museum  and Wildlife Preserve  in Bartlesville, west of  Bartlesville, I think is awesome. It probably has the best beadwork  blankets, everything that you want. The Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa and  the Philbrook Museum in Tulsa   there are three there that are probably  the finest museums in the United States. There are other museums that  we   ve attended, but those are wonderful museums.  Have you ever been back to the Euchee homelands in the Southeast?  Yes, yes we have. We just recently returned from there about a week  ago. We were visiting friends in Georgia, and the Euchees were in  Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee, southern Tennessee, and  northern Georgia. We   ve driven around and seen Euchee churches and  Euchee cemeteries and different things like that in reference to the  Euchees who lived there during that time. This is our second visit there  to our friends    in Americus, Georgia, which is near Plains, Georgia.  President Jimmy Carter grew up there. We   ve looked at a lot of the  17  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Euchee history there, and we stop at different places and see and read  the inscriptions on the buildings and things.  Do you sell your work through galleries?  Yes. Most of the Native Americans will sell work through galleries. At  first, I didn   t sell much through galleries because I was working full-time  at the time and didn   t have that much inventory. I would have  people come down from Canyon Road in Santa Fe that would want my  beaded blankets. I just never had enough inventory to give them four or  five blankets and then still sell because beadwork is quite time-consuming  in its operation, very time-consuming. Now that I   ve retired,  I   ve had a little more time. I   ve gotten into two or three galleries.  What are your galleries?  I   ve been in and out of different galleries at different times. You   ll stay  in them for a year and then move to different galleries. There was a  gallery in Sedona, Arizona, that was really nice. I took most of my big  pieces there. Linda Goldenstein was the name of the gallery, and was a  very highly-ranked gallery. Shiprock Santa Fe  Gallery , Jed Foutz, he  carries some of my work. Northern New Mexico Art Gallery in New  Mexico was there, and then he moved from right off the square in Santa  Fe to over the rail yard. He   s moved out to southern California now.  Those were the three that at different times I   ve had artwork in those  three galleries.  How important for you are commissions?  Well, when we started doing this, I did not do it as an income because I  was working at the time. Now that we   re retired, the commissions     different people charge different commissions, and that   s what people  told me when I first started putting work in galleries. The commissions  are good because the people that show your work need to have some of  the income from those things. I don   t know. Different people think  differently about the commissions. Sometimes it   s a sixty-forty,  sometimes a fifty-fifty, but the galleries have to make their money, too.  I was actually thinking of commissions in terms of people ordering. Do  you take commissions from people?  Oh, individual commissions on artwork, yes. At first, I did not like to do  commission work because it ties me down to having to do things that     I   d rather be doing other things and be freelance and kind of do what I  want to do. I   ve probably done maybe less than half a dozen commission  pieces. I really prefer to do just what I do and then sell them, but if  18  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  someone sees a piece that recently sold and says,    Well, I   d like one of  those,    I might make another one. I haven   t done very many commission  pieces. A lot of the artists really, really like to do the commission pieces  for people. I never did get into that as much.  Do you sell quite a bit from your home, as well?  No, I   ve had two or three people that have purchased things from Indian  Market. They would be coming through Oklahoma City, and they would  call and stop and have collected my work in the last five years or so, five  or six years, that will come by and look at our work area here and buy a  piece. Usually, I don   t sell much out of the house.  I think one of the issues that bead artists have run into is that in general  (and it hasn   t been fair) bead art doesn   t get the price that it deserves,  really. What are your thoughts on that?  I think you would know that, too, your background, your history with  your husband  Merlin Little Thunder . I think probably next to weaving,  beadwork is the most time-consuming of all the artwork. If you   ll talk to  painters, they can knock out a painting pretty fast. I   m sure sculpture  takes awhile, but the sculptures, artists that do that, they can make  bronzes, and then they   ll have ten bronzes or five bronzes they can sell,  which is wonderful for them. Very, very time-consuming.  They don   t pay me by the hour. They don   t pay beadworkers by the  hour, I can tell you that. If they did, we probably couldn   t sell any of our  work because it   d be over-priced. (Laughter) It is very, very time-consuming,  and you can put a price on it and hope someone purchases it.  I guess sometimes, if they don   t purchase it, then you can maybe mark it  down at another show. Indian Market is the Super Bowl of Indian  artwork, so the prices out there are pretty steady. When I go to other  shows sometimes, the economy may be different, so the prices may be a  little different.  Do you think there should be a distinction made between bead art and  bead craft?  Well, it all started out as tourist craft, and I think that   s the history of  beadwork, selling it. The Native Americans made beadwork for  themselves, for their shirts and their cradleboards and their knife cases  and things like that, but when it began to be selling, then they made the  trinkets and the smaller pieces that they sold to tourists. I think,  probably, there should be a little bit of a distinction, and I think that   s  probably coming.  19  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  What would it be based on?  I don   t know what rules they would use, what they would base it on. I  feel like the people that make smaller things need to enjoy selling their  things as much as I do, but I think the standards will be getting into art  shows. The standards that they set at the art shows will decide who gets  in and who doesn   t get in. The people that don   t get in sometimes will  sell their work to museums or to tourist places, and they can sell their  artwork at that level. I think most of the art shows, the higher-end art  shows, have pretty strict standards to get in as far as painting, beading,  sculpture, whatever you   re doing.  What about the business side of art? What have you learned about that?  I think it   s a business for most of the people because that   s their  livelihood. They have to have whatever they   re making, and that is their  livelihood. The Native Americans haven   t enjoyed a great deal of  prosperity, and they   ve had some problems all through generations. I  think it is a business for most of them, and you do have to pay business  tax. All of us have to do that. For some people, and for me, for example,  I do not depend on this for a living, and so I don   t see it as a business,  per se. But again, it is a business because I have to have a business  license and pay sales tax.  Wherever you go, you have to sign up, get a sales tax number. I think  it   s very, very important for some of the people. That   s their total  livelihood, total income, but I   m fortunate enough that this is not my  total income. It   s kind of a hobby, something I enjoy doing. If we sell  out, I   m happy. If we sell nothing, I   m happy, just to be able to be  around the artists, to be in those shows, to talk to people that I   ve met. I  think the Native Americans and the Native American artists are truly a  wonderful group of people.  You have a nice story about being at Kauger   s show that illustrates the  networking and support you   ve gotten from some of the artists. Do you  want to share that?  Oh, definitely. You have to have a lot of support and networking. People  need to support you and encourage you and so forth. Yvonne Kauger,  like I mentioned earlier, did several shows. I don   t think she   s currently  doing them, but, originally, it was one of the first shows that I did. I was  so excited to be there because all the famous artists were there because  she invited all the top artists in Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma area.  I was there and was just so happy to be standing around, talking to all  the famous artists. I happened to be standing next to Ben Harjo, and he   s  20  Little Thunder  Berryhill  one of the top artists. I told Ben,    Man, I   m excited to be here  I just  can   t believe I   m here. I just love it  I get to meet all these artists that  I   ve known about and talked about and see in the newspaper and  everything, but I don   t know how I got here.     Ben was standing next to me, and he said,    Well, I know.    I said,     Really?    He said,    Yes. I gave her your name.    I said,    Really? You  gave her my name?    He said,    Yes.    Yvonne invited me on Ben   s  recommendation, and, evidently, I got in, and I   ve been doing well  since. You have to have the support from other artists and from other  people. Of course, Yvonne   s just been a great ambassador for Native  American art.  You mentioned that you really got into your beading seriously as an art  when you met Pat, that it happened around the same time. Can you talk  about her role in your development of art?  Yes, I   d been making the knife cases prior to marrying Pat, and I  continue to make them. Like I said, she   s the one that said,    Why don   t  you try going to art shows?    So I began to do that. She   s very creative  and comes up with some really good ideas. I like to have her input into  different things, especially colors and, I think, types of artwork that I   ve  been doing. In fact, she   s come up with the idea for several of the things,  the categories, or the areas that I   m working on right now. Seemed like  coming back from Santa Fe each year, we would talk about this, driving  back. She   d come up with an idea, we   d get home, and I   d start doing it.  The thing on the Native American Navajo rugs, she came up with that,  that idea. She said,    Why don   t you bead some rugs?    I said,    How do  you do that?    Then, of course, I came home and began to look at  artwork and rugs and figured out which ones I could do and which ones  I couldn   t do and began to do that. Several years later, she came up with  the idea of these wooden spoons. Said,    Wooden spoons would be  good.    I said,    Who would buy a wooden spoon?    She said,    Well, you  just do it, and then you   ll find out. People will put those in their kitchen.  Women will buy those.    I said,    Oh, really?     I had already done a few military-type spoons and things that I   d found,  so that was an easy transition. Then she came up with the perfume  bottles. She said,    Do some perfume bottles. They   ll buy those.    Of  course, I knew, and I   d seen in the magazines and books that Native  Americans had already been doing bottles and so forth. A lot of these  things come from her.  She   s seen things like these large keys that used to open the big doors on  the big Mexican haciendas. She thought those would be cool. Then the  21  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  branding irons, they   re called saddle irons, which are cut down so that  they   ll fit on the back of a saddle. You can cut off a stick out in the back  and put it in there and use it as branding, and they can make candle  holders. She came up with those. Probably half of the ideas that we   re  into now came from her because she   s very creative. I always tell people  that the Native American saying is,    If it stands still, we   ll bead it.    So  don   t stand still. (Laughter)  I   d like to talk a little bit about the piece that you won second place on  at Red Earth, which was a shell dress, dentalium dress. Did that present  any special challenges? It was a bead picture, I guess.  Yes, I call it bead artwork where we actually make a picture. You   re  doing a picture. I know I   ve done a pretty good job if in the back of the  booth it   s hung up, people will come by, and they   ll say,    Les, when did  you start painting?    (Laughter) I say,    That   s not a painting.    They say,     Yes, that one right there is a painting.    I say,    No, that   s beadwork.    I  had to use very fine beads, the smaller beads, in that and had a variety of  colors.  Then, of course, I see a lot of these. I don   t make them up. Most of them  are seen in pictures, old pictures or new pictures or powwow pictures,  where people will be making the dentalium dresses made out of seashell  from the ocean, (that   s the top third of the dress) and then others will be  making them from elk teeth. A bull elk will have two ivory teeth.  They   re actually not ivory, but that   s what they   re called, and they  would make a dress out of that, put those all on the dress. I had to be  creative and come up with something that looked like that or replicated  what those things were.  Then the dentalium shells, they actually make dentalium shells in  different sizes. They   ll come as large as two inches, two and a half  inches, all the way down to half an inch. I found some that were smaller,  and had a picture and did that piece. It actually had a knife case, beaded  knife case, on the dress. Then the elk-tooth dresses, I found some larger  beads that were the color of the elk teeth, and they worked out real well.  I   ve done probably three or four of those in different colors, and they   re  representing a dancer at a powwow, Native American dancer at  powwow. Again, I either saw the picture in a magazine or in a book. I  also have gone to powwows and seen them dancing and would take  notes and so forth and began to do that.  Try to catch a bit of the motion, the sense of movement.  Yes, that   s correct. A lot of people say on the elk dress, it looks like  22  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  she   s actually dancing. I did one, replicated from one of Ben Harjo   s  dancers, where the cloth on her dress is swaying like this, swaying back  and forth as she   s dancing. It turned out real well. It really looked  authentic. They   re hard to do sometimes when you   ve got to figure out,  map out, figure out the entire thing before you actually start.  The attraction, I think they are just wonderful, but it   s interesting, taking  from one medium and translating it into another. What draws you to  that?  Well, I did just the single things, like I was talking about, and then to get  some depth on it, I began to do different things. I guess there are people  that do this, but I call it spot beading. There   s another term, another form  of beadwork that   s called spot stitch, but I do it one bead at a time, and  that   s what   s on my dresses. I   ll put one bead down, and then I   ll come  back and put another bead down, and I   ll put another bead down. It   s  quite time-consuming, as opposed to laying down a whole line of beads  and then going back and tacking them down, which is another process,  lane stitch or line stitch.  When I began to do that, that allowed me to make a more authentic-looking  dress. Also, on my skull, the bison skull, it was completely spot  stitch, and then it had a few designs on it, some symmetrical designs on  the head of the bison and on the eye. It   s involved. Again, you have to  know two or three different types of stitching. Like I said, the pictures  that I do now, (bead painting is what I call it, bead painting) they   re  done with my spot stitch, which is different from the traditional spot  stitch, which I put down one bead at a time, and it makes a different  look, totally different look.  That   s a good point at which to segue into talking about your process a  little more. It   s so interesting to me that this stereotype in the dominant  society is if you   re real athletic, you   re not the kind of person to do any  kind of sit-still work, really fine work, and yet there are just so many  people I know that are athletically-oriented and they love this minute,  detailed, have-to-sit-still-and-focus kind of work. Do you have any  thoughts on that?  Yes. I think a lot of the artwork, you really have to be focused, and you  have to be patient. That   s one of the virtues that I think I have is  patience. You can ask my wife. She   ll tell you that I   m very patient,  being married to her. (Laughter) You have to have patience and  concentration, and that comes from athletics, too. You have to be patient  in certain things that you   re doing, whether it   s football or running track  or whatever, baseball. You have to be patient to a certain extent, and you  have to concentrate. Those things, traits, have to be used in athletics and,  23  Little Thunder  Berryhill  I think, in the beadwork.  Then again, you learn to try to do them faster. I   m trying to pick up my  pace because beadwork is so slow, I   ve tried to be faster. How do you  get faster at doing these things and producing these things? Some of  them you just can   t. You just can   t be faster. It just doesn   t work. You  have to be patient. You have to take the time to put in the work to do it,  and that goes back, again, to I don   t know if we get enough money to  pay us per hour for the work we do.  Talking a bit about your process and techniques, there are both, kinds of  beads and sizes of beads, to consider. What are some of your primary  materials?  Well, of course, the beads are the primary thing. The traditional way the  Native Americans beaded was on smoked, brain-tanned buckskin, and  that is an art in itself. There are a few people here in Oklahoma that do  that. I   ve purchased some hides from them, and they   re quite expensive.  They   re very expensive. I just recently purchased some in Santa Fe.  When we enter the competition, we usually put that down, that it   s  traditional Native American material: smoked, they smoked it to keep  the insects away from it, and it   s brain-tanned buckskin from the deer.  Of course, that   s, I think, all I   ve been using. Again, the Native  Americans used some canvas, and so I cover some things in canvas. I  don   t bead on it as a background, but I   ve covered some things in  canvas.  Of course, the beads, itself, and the string we used, the type of string is a  nylon string now. Several different companies make it, and it comes in  different sizes. The needles, of course, is the key thing. You have to  have needles, and they come in different sizes, and threads come in  different sizes.  Depending on what you   re beading, as far as the strength of something,  you have to use a heavier thread, and then the beads themselves.  They   ve really reproduced, replicated the colors of the beads quite well.  Every once in a while, you   ll run into someone that will have some old  beads, traditional old beads. In fact, I   ve got a couple of friends that send  me some old beads when they find some. They like putting old beads on  their pieces, and I would do that, too. I usually didn   t have enough to do  the whole project, but I would put some old beads in there and then tell  the people if they purchased that piece of equipment, there was some old  beads in there.  The coloring has really been replicated well. Italy and Czech Republic  24  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  and the Japanese are making beads now. I guess they   re using the  original formulas or something because the beads are really, really well  done, and the coloring is really good on them. I   ve been impressed with  that because I like to use all the old colors. Of course, you have a lot of  traditional, contemporary colors that Native Americans didn   t have, but  they had a lot of the old colors that they used.  They started off with trade beads, which made big necklaces as big as  your finger, chevrons and padre beads and those types of beads. Then  they began to bring in pony beads, which are large beads. They were  called pony beads because they were brought in big barrels on the backs  of ponies, so they began to use those. Then on the East Coast, they  brought in seed beads. That was the last one, probably. In the 1860s,  they brought in seed beads.  This was about the time the Native Americans were being on  reservations and going to schools and stuff, so they did a lot of beading.  They were no longer nomads, no longer roaming around. They were  stationary, so they had more time to bead. These beads came in at a good  time, and they were called seed beads. Again, they come in a number of  sizes, and they are quite unique. A lot of people use the real small ones.  They come in sixteens and eighteens. The larger the number on the bead,  the smaller the bead. I started off using elevens.  Seed beads is mainly what you use.  Yes, seed beads. Mostly use thirteens now. Most of my beadwork is  thirteens, but then if I do a large project like the bison skull, I jump up  there and use some tens and some pony beads. I have to cover a lot of  surface. The beads, I think, are really, really good, the replication and  coloring, and the prices aren   t bad. The prices aren   t bad, but you can  also purchase some old-type beads, too. I have some old beads, still, and  I would put them on small bags and things that didn   t take a lot of  beadwork.  Going back to your knife cases real quickly, are you using both buckskin  and buffalo hide? Do you need that harder part to make the scabbard?  You make them yourself, right?  Yes, yes. You make them yourself, and the beadwork, itself, is put on  the brain-tanned buck skin. Then you have to have a base for that in  there. A lot of them will do a rawhide base or a buckskin leather base or  some kind of a thicker leather as the base. Then you sew that together,  and you sew the brain-tanned over the top of that. Then if you have  knives, you put the knife in there, too, and you   ve got to pattern it to the  shape of the knife or the length of the knife and the size of the knife.  25  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  That   s a lot of work, for sure. Can you pretty much gauge how many  beads you need for a project now by sight, or do you calculate?  Usually on a big project, I   ll have to purchase beads for that particular  project. I   ve just got beads everywhere. I   ve got so many beads, I   ll  never be able to use them all. You can pretty much project how much.  Sometimes there   s some rule of thumb (they give them in these catalogs)  about how much a hank is a string of beads or an ounce of beads, how  much that would cover. It   ll cover four inches or six inches. If you   ve  got a five-square-inch something, you   ve got to get enough beads to  cover that. It   s a lot of calculations involved, actually, surprisingly.  Do you make many mistakes anymore and have to cut out what you did?  Oh, yes. I just read something recently about that. A couple of  beadworkers that influenced me earlier, Marcus Amerman, who is from  Oklahoma, Choctaw, he   s an outstanding beadworker and is one of the  best beadworkers in the world.  And was into that bead painting very early.  Yes, got into the bead painting very early. He   s told me many things that  I use. One of the things he said was that it   s always to your advantage to  tear something out if it   s not done very well and do it again to make it fit  what you really want it to look like. I   ve done that many times. I   ve  done that many times. I think that   s important, too. I just read that in one  of the bead magazines recently. If you   re doing a three-inch-square  something, don   t be scared to tear out half of that to redo it to make it  right, and I think most beadworkers will do that.  What   s another thing that Amerman told you?  Well, one of the first things, he came here to the house up to my  studio     When was this?  This was probably mid   90s. He moved to Santa Fe and lived here and  went to Red Earth for several years. His mother and father, I met them.  He has a brother that   s an excellent beadworker, too, that   s from the  West Coast, the Oregon-Washington State area. Came here and said,     Where do you do your beadwork?    It was exactly where we are sitting  now, and I had no lighting. He said,    Where   s your lighting?    I said,     It   s just right here, up above.    (Laughter) He said,    Really? You need  to get some light, Les. You need to get a light. Get a light put on your  26  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  desk, there, and that   ll help you.    I said,    Really?    He said,    Yes.     (Laughter)  So I began to get lights and put them on my desk. I   ve always been near-sighted,  so I never had to have glasses or reading glasses and have very  good eyesight. When I turned the lights on, though, it was like night and  day. (Laughter) Marcus has influenced me in several areas to help me  get started. Now, as I   m getting older and doing it for a longer period of  time, I do wear reading glasses to do most of my work.  What   s the relationship between beauty and functionality in your work?  The things I   ve been doing recently are more for the beauty of the work,  itself, the creativity of it. The early things I did was more functional.  They were made for the Native Americans, and they had functional use.  That   s why they made them. They didn   t make a lot for decoration or for  beauty, itself. A few of the things they would put on their jackets and on  the cradleboards were, but most of the earlier things were functional.  They were knife cases, all those things, the bags that they used. Of  course, they began to decorate the moccasins and the cradleboards and  the jackets and vests and things like that.  There   s a big difference in it. I think most of my work now, since I   m  not as traditional as I was, (I   ve been bead painting) is more for the art,  itself, the beauty of it, to actually looking at it. Like I said, people will  question me that I   m doing paintings instead of beadwork on my dresses  and on my Navajo blankets. They   ll say,    Oh, you   re weaving now.    I   ll  say,    No, that   s beads. Those are beads.       Oh, really?    They   ll look  closer, and they   ll say    Oh, yes. That   s beads.    It   s a change, and I   m  kind of staying in the area where you make things for the beauty of it  now.  You   ve talked a little bit about how you do your bead paintings. I  wonder if you could talk just a little bit about the wrap technique that   s  involved with your perfume bottles or the quirts.  Sure. Those were some of the things I did later. The first things I did, I  used the traditional loop stitch, lane stitch, different stitching styles that  the Native Americans did. Later on when I began to do the round  objects, then I began to use the traditional, the first method that the  Native Americans had, which was just wrapping it around. You just  have to wrap it, wrap it, wrap it, wrap it.  But, again, there   s the artistic part of the colors and the style of it and the  geometric design of it. People, one of the things they   ve mentioned is  my color combinations, how I put the colors together. They really like  27  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  how the colors are put together. I don   t think much about it, but I do use  the traditional colors, which I think most of them go well together,  anyway.  Are they on a buckskin? Is there a buckskin backing?  Yes, I first started off with a buckskin backing around the implement or  around the bottle, and then I graduated to canvas, put a canvas on there,  which helps it. Now, I   ve progressed to the point where I can put it  directly onto the bottle or onto the wooden implement. Figured out a  technique of how to do that, which cuts down on the time involved. The  time factor in beading is so essential, and I figured out how to do that  now by not putting anything on there. It just goes directly onto the bottle  and onto the wooden implement.  What is your creative process from the time you get an idea?  I think, first of all, you have to figure out the idea. It comes first, what  you want to do. Say, it   s an elk tooth dress. Then I have to figure out,     How am I going to do this? What is going to replicate those elk teeth,  and how am I going to do this?    And then the colors that you   re going to  use, and then you have to lay that out artistically by drawing it. You  have to actually draw it out, and then you have to transplant that onto the  leather, to bead onto the leather, the brain-tanned.  You put that on there, and then you have to decide on your technique  that you   re going to use on that particular beadwork. Like I said, on my  dresses I   ve been using that spot stitch, which is very slow. It   s much  slower than any other types of stitching, but I think it makes a better-looking  dress. It makes it look more authentic-looking. Then you have to  put in or include the elk teeth or the dentalium shells, whatever it is  you   re adding to that. It is a creative process that takes a little bit of time.  It does. I say the preparation is more time-consuming than you think it  would be.  How about your creative routine? Do you have a routine, in terms of  certain times of the day that you try to work?  Before I retired, I would work in the evenings and on weekends. I would  just work at night for a couple, two, or three hours, and then I would  work on weekends, Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon or  something. You   ve got to have time to do other things. But now that I   m  retired, I have so much more time, I actually could just get up, and then I  can start whenever I want to. I can start at nine o   clock if I want.  Sometimes I   ll start at one o   clock, and then I   ll work until about five-thirty,  and then I won   t do anything. Or I   ll come back at seven o   clock  28  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  and work until ten and do certain things.  What I like to do is have things in different stages. I like to have things  that I   m starting, I like to have things that I   m in the middle of, and I like  to have a project that I   m about finishing up. I like to have a project that  I   m designing, figuring out what I   m going to do next. I like to have  different phases of different ideas so that I   m not bored, just doing this  over and over and over and over and over. I branch out and do different  things, and that helps me stay a little more alert instead of falling asleep  while I   m beading. (Laughter)  What   s a project you   re especially excited about right now?  Like I said, I   ve changed different things over the years, changed the  patterns I   ve been doing. I   m into the fish now. I like fish, the rainbow  trouts and the different trouts that fly fisherman use. I   m really into that,  and I   ll probably do a few more of those. I   ve only done two or three on  brain-tanned, and then I did one that was mounted on a wooden vase.  The fish, itself, was mounted on the wooden vase and stood up on a  platform. It was probably about ten inches long and about three inches  high. I   ll probably do another one of those. I   ve been doing six-inch  trouts on brain-tanned, and I enjoy those things now. As far as anything  new, I haven   t come up with anything in particular, other than the fish.  That   s been the last thing that I   ve done.  What   s been a turning point for you, do you think, in terms of a fork-in-the-  road moment, once you did decided you wanted to spend your time  doing this, once you were able to?  When I first started or after I   ve been retired?  In either situation.  Oh, in either situation? Well, when I first started, it was just to satisfy  my own personal need, which was I wanted twenty knife cases and that  was going to be all of it. Then after I got into going to shows, then it  became the creative part of it. Like I said, I was fortunate enough not to  have to make it my business, to make it my livelihood.  We like to travel, and so we go to different shows. I   ve gone to a number  of shows in different places. We   ve done shows in Dallas, Tulsa,  Cherokee Art Show, and the Red Earth here. Prescott, Arizona, has a  real nice show that we   ve gone to for years, over different years.  Phoenix Heard Museum show is a wonderful, wonderful show. I went to  a show in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which was wonderful. We love  going up there. We include travel into our shows, and we travel a lot,  29  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  too.  It   s the creative part of it. It   s not the financial or monetary part of it. It   s  the relationships that you develop with other artists and with people that  organize the shows, like the Red Earth people. The people over in Tulsa  are so nice. The people in the Heard are wonderful. The people in the  SWAIA  Southwest Association for Indian Arts  Indian Market are  wonderful.  I was on the Board of SWAIA, which is a governing body for the Indian  art show, for two years. The people out there are just wonderful, too.  None of it could have been done without one, the artist, and two, the  volunteers, and then the administration that organize the show and run it.  I think recently, it   s been more of a creative thing to figure out  something new and something different that I haven   t done before. Right  now, I haven   t done any blankets for several years, so I think I   ll go  back and do some blankets. There was a gentleman that purchased a  blanket in Phoenix not too long ago, and he just really likes the blankets.  He collects trade beads, and I didn   t have very many blankets at the  time. I told him I had several kinds. He said,    Oh, man  Those would be  cool. I   d like to see some of those.    So I   m maybe going back and doing  three different phases of the chiefs blankets that I did before.  What has been a high point of your career?  Oh, probably my grandkids coming to the first art show that I did. They  were excited.  How old were they?  They weren   t very old. They were probably five and six, something like  that. It was at Red Earth. Of course, any time you compete and do well  in competition and win, that   s exciting, too, and just seeing all your  friends and the people that come back. It   s very moving for me to have  people that return and purchase items from you. When I first started this,  I didn   t realize that would happen. People told me that, and I was kind of  skeptical, but it happens. It   s very nice, and those people are wonderful  that come back and collect your artwork.  Anyway, they  the grandchildren  came to one of the shows, and we  have a director   s chair, usually, that we set up that   s up high. Sometimes  it   ll have your name on it. People have done different ones, different  ways. We don   t use the directors    chairs much anymore, but we did  when we first started because everyone had directors    chairs. Oh, they  thought that was wonderful. Sit up in a director   s chair and look at  30  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  everybody, and everyone   s coming by and saying hi and waving.  (Laughter) That was really interesting and neat for them to come and  see. I   m Grandpa Bear, by the way. I have a nickname of Bear. To see  Grandpa Bear do his artwork, that was interesting. (Laughter)  How   d you get your nickname?  When the children were born, the other grandmothers asked me what I  wanted to be. I said,    Grandpa.    They said,    No, you can   t be Grandpa.  That   s just too old. Like, I   m Mama K, and the other one was Pa. What  do you want to be called?    I had no idea. (Laughter) I did not know why  it came out of my mouth, but I said,    Bear. Grandpa Bear.    She said,     That   s cool. Okay, you   re Grandpa Bear.    My family purchased me a  bracelet that has a bear on it, and I enjoy that.  I think I began to call Pat   they call her Pat-Pat. That   s her nickname.  Her grandmother name is Pat-Pat. I believe I called her Bear before I  even became Bear, so I guess that   s what popped out in me is Bear.  That   s been exciting, for the grandchildren to come, and my son and  daughter-in-law.  Going to all these different shows and being accepted to the shows,  when you feel humble and people enjoy your work, that   s been very  good, too. To be able to be accepted at Indian Market and the Heard  Museum, those are the two largest shows out there, now. Like I said,  these other shows are really unique, and I enjoy them. Jackson Hole,  Prescott, the two shows here in Oklahoma, I really support them. It   s  very, very good. I just really enjoy the camaraderie and the people that  you meet and see and get to talk to and go around and visit with.  Sometimes you   re too busy with your booth to be able to go around. At  Indian Market they   re spread out so far, it   s hard to get to see some of  the people, but it   s really rewarding.  What   s been one of the low points?  I don   t know that I   ve had any low points during the art shows. Most of  the time, I   ve been accepted into shows. I would think, probably, if I was  trying to get into a show and couldn   t get in, that would be a low point  that would discourage you. Like I said, it happened at Santa Fe. I was  accepted. My work was approved, but there were not enough booths for  everyone to get in. They had a little trailer there that if you could share a  booth with somebody, then you possibly could get in. It would usually  take you five years to get your own booth. I was able to do that and  share with someone. They gave you a list of people from your area that  you could actually share with.  31  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Once I got my booth, I made a pledge to myself that I   d always share  with somebody, even though it reduces your booth space. That allows  other people to get into the shows that wouldn   t, and that   s what I  confirmed when I first started trying to get in. The other shows, I got in  most of the time.  Is there anything else you   d like to add or talk about before we start  looking at your work?  No. I just thank you, Julie, for coming down all the way from Stillwater  and of course, from Tulsa, where you live. I appreciate the time you take  to do this and share these things that the artists talk to you about, and  allow that to be shared with other people online and different places. I  appreciate you. Thank you.  Well, thank you, and let   s take a look at your work. This is an example of  one of your beaded skulls.  This is the second deer skull that I   ve done. The first one won second  place in Santa Fe. Then I did a bison skull, and then I   ve done an elk  skull. These are the three or four that I   ve done. On this, it   s kind of a  contemporary look as opposed to a traditional look. The first deer skull  was a traditional look with a little bit of design on it. The bison skull was  traditional. This is more contemporary.  I did my spot stitching on this. Most of the time the skull is completely  covered with the buckskin. I take it off, then I bead it on there, and then  you have to put it back on. Usually, it   s 100 percent or 90 percent  covered with beads.  Was that a lightning design?  Probably. I can   t remember exactly what I did when I did that one.  It has a really poignant quality in the design.  That on the jaw line there, it was a mountain, designed to be a mountain,  and then, of course, I think the nose was a lightning strike. Then the  others were just designs. His eye, black eye, is just kind of very  contemporary. That represents a mountain. We   d gone out to Wyoming  and had seen some mountains out there, the Teton Mountains, and that  was a replica of the Teton Mountains.  That   s nice.  This is one of the bead dresses that I   ve been doing. I   ve done probably  32  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  four or five. This is a lady dancing at the powwow. This is an elk-tooth  dress. I   ve done them in red and green and navy blue, and she   s dancing  at the powwow. I   ve seen a lot of elk-tooth dresses in magazines and in  books and wanted to replicate that. I thought this one turned out real  well. I do this size. I   ve done one larger, probably three times this large,  one of Ben Harjo   s dancing girls, swaying at the powwow. Usually,  they   re all taken from the rear like this, so you can see the dress and  don   t have to do much with the face, just see the back of the head.  I love the shadow effect you created on the arms.  Yes, those are where the arms are. The crease is there in the elbow area.  This is mounted and sewn onto smoked, brain-tanned buckskin. That   s  the background of it before I frame it.  That   s beautiful.  This is a squash blossom necklace that my wife has. I used it as a model  and just decided to bead it one day. Like I said, the creativity, I guess,  came out. It   s a turquoise squash blossom necklace, and it   s replicated  the exact size that my wife has. I thought it turned out very good. Some  of the squash blossoms are quite complicated. This one was more  simple, an older piece. I thought it turned out well.  This is my wife   s favorite piece, I think. People see it in the back of the  booth, and they   ll say,    When did you start drawing, painting? Is that a  painting?    (Laughter) I   ll say,    No, that   s my beadwork.    I   ll take it  down and bring it out to the front of the booth so they can see it, and  they   ll say,    Oh, my goodness. That is really nice.    I really like it. It   s  the only necklace I   ve ever beaded in this style like this. I don   t know. I  thought the squash blossom was a traditional Native American necklace,  so I did that one.  This is a cradleboard. I began to collect cradleboards from Deanna  Broughton, who lives in Ardmore, who is an artist. She would make  these out of plaster of paris or workable artwork, and she sold them at  Red Earth. She   s a very good artist. She began to make them, and I  began to collect them probably eight, ten years ago. I   ve made two or  three, and this is a Nez Perce cradleboard. Again, it   s beaded on smoked,  brain-tanned buckskin. I probably have twenty-plus of these, and this is  a more simple design that I could reproduce in beadwork. Some of them  are very complicated, and it   s hard to replicate them.  I   ve done probably three or four different tribes of this. I did a Creek and  did this Nez Perce and one other one. I   ve forgotten which other one I  did. They are very popular. People like them, and I really, really enjoy  33  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  Little Thunder  Berryhill  doing them. They look very creative.  Yes, even the shape of the buckskin behind it.  I was going to show you this other fish I did. I don   t know if you saw it  or not.  Oh, yes, I think fish are so beautiful. When you see the naturalists     renditions of fish, this is gorgeous.  I   ve done two or three, and, like I said, the first one I gave to a friend as  a birthday present. He   s a fly fisherman.  He has a lot of personality. (Laughs)  Here is the one that I did. I   ve sewn it on a wooden outline in the shape  of a fish and mounted it on that.  That   s really ingenious. Oh, it   s beautiful. I would say you probably  need to do a couple more like that, too.  I   ve got that in mind, to do a couple more.  This is a beaded blanket that I do, Navajo blankets. This design is from  the Southwest. I saw the original blanket in the Woolaroc Museum in  Bartlesville. Woolaroc is a wonderful museum, has a lot of Native  American artifacts there. This was a design that I just fell in love with. I  made some pencil drawings of this and came back and beaded it. It   s a  Navajo Southwest blanket.  I really, really like the pattern and made probably four or five and sold  them all, except this one. I really enjoy doing chiefs blankets, first,  second, third phase, and all the Navajo blankets that aren   t too  complicated. Some of them are too complicated to really do a good  pattern, but this one turned out very well.  It   s beautiful, and the fluidity of the beads matches the weaving. Well,  thank you so much for your time today, Les.  Oh, no, thank you. You   re the one that put in all the time and expertise  to do this. This is amazing. Thank you.  -------  -------
