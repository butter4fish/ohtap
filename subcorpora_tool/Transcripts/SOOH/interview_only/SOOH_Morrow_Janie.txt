 Finchum  Morrow  Today is August 16, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re conducting an oral  history project focused on Cooperative Extension educators. Today we  are in Oklahoma City to speak with Janie Hopfer Morrow, who was a 4-  H educator from 1977 to 2003. Thank you for coming today.  Thank you.  Let   s get started by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood,  where you were born, and then we will work our way forward.  I was born in Frederick, Oklahoma, Tillman County. My parents never  lived in Frederick. We lived in Walters the entire time, but the doctor  Mother had been going to had recently moved to Frederick, so they went  to Frederick for the birth. I spent the first six months of life on a farm  east of Walters, and then my parents moved into town thinking it was  much better to be in town with two young children than out on the farm  a good distance from places. My father was working at the time at the  cooperative elevator, which was just on the edge of town.  I grew up and went my entire twelve years through the Walters school  system, was heavily involved in the Cotton County 4-H program. When  I was in junior high I started walking the Extension home economist   s  children home after school and staying with them until she got home.  She was a widow. So, I sort of watched what she did and developed a  real love for Extension and the work that Extension did. That was really  my goal, to go to work for Extension after I graduated from college.  Neither of my parents had more than an eighth grade education. Both of  them had to quit school when a parent died to help on the farm and help  with younger siblings, but from the time my sister and I were really  young they talked about college. Even though we had very meager  5  means at the time and not funds to save for college, they always told us  there was a way with scholarships and working to be able to go to  college. That was their dream for us. My parents were older when I was  born. Mother was forty-two and my dad was fifty-two. So, my sister and  I, who was fifteen months older, were very special to them. They had  been married for several years before they had children, and their first  son only lived nine days. About three years, when my sister came along,  she was very special, and fifteen months later I came along. We grew up  as a close-knit family. At the time, I did not think it was that special. I  thought it was like I was living with grandparents. You know, all the  other kids at school had younger parents. We did not socialize a lot with  the parents of other children because they were younger, but we really  had a unique growing up period. My sister and I were very close, and  when she started school I was just crushed because I couldn   t go with  her. We had a cellar in the backyard, so every day after school she  would come home and we fixed the cellar sort of like a school room, and  she would try to teach me what she had learned in school that day. Then  the next year when we both got to go that was a real special time.  The May that I graduated from high school, I started to OSU in June.  My sister was already there, so we enrolled in summer school and the  Extension home economist also enrolled in summer school. Her two  children stayed with Mother and Daddy for the summer and she took us  to OSU for summer school. I was there three years and three summers  and graduated. Grades were always very important, so I made the honor  roll and graduated magna cum laude, and I was really pleased. I also  worked at the campus PBX, the telephone switchboard, and was  involved in the collegiate 4-H program, Omicron Nu, and the home  economics organization.  My dream was really to go to work for Extension, but when I graduated  in 1967 there was a freeze with Extension and they weren   t hiring. So, I  interviewed for schools and signed a contract with the Crescent Public  School System. Actually, before I was twenty-one. The superintendent  let me know, he said,    Now Jamie, you aren   t twenty-one yet. This  really isn   t official.    But I was twenty-one before school started in the  fall. I spent four years teaching and had a really good experience. The  superintendant was a real mentor that I looked up to, because I was  rather naive and young to be teaching high school. I had junior high and  high school home economics classes.  I remember a real challenge that I had that first year, over a home project  that the girl actually had not done. I knew she hadn   t because it was a  serger clothing instruction project, and home sergers were not prevalent  at the time. So, I went in to the superintendant and discussed it with him.  He said,    Well, what do you want to do?    and I said,    Well, confront  6  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  her. She didn   t do it.    And he said,    Janie, you can   t accuse someone.  What do you have to base it on?    I said,    I just know.    And he said,     Well, you can   t do that.    I have remembered that throughout my career.  He gave me some ideas about talking in class, about honesty and  integrity, and how important things were. It took about two weeks, but  she came to me and just broke down crying and told me that she had a  real bad home situation and had to take care of siblings and didn   t have  time to do a home project. So, she had turned in a purchased blouse. I  said,    Why didn   t you come and talk to me?    Well, she didn   t know she  could. I think we both learned from that.  Later, when I went to work for Extension, I had a very good county  director that I started with, L.B. McClure, who has since passed away. I  had a somewhat similar situation that I had to discuss with him, and I  was told by a volunteer that I would not be sitting behind that desk until  we figured something out. (Laughs) It was all over a poultry barbeque  judging at the county fair, which the volunteer, who was a parent, didn   t  agree with the placings that the judge had done. Well, I had arrived on  the scene after the judges had already been recruited, because I started to  work just a few weeks before the county fair. I told her, I said,    I   m  sorry, but the judge   s decision stands. We may not choose to have the  same judge return another year, but we don   t change the judge   s  placings.    Of course, he supported me with that and twenty-six years  later I retired, and I was sitting behind the same desk the entire time.  (Laughs) I think those two experiences, both when I was new in  positions, really helped to frame the philosophy, the thoughts, and the  important things that I saw in each particular job.  Let   s back up a minute. You mentioned that you had a real close  relationship with the Cooperative Extension agent in high school. What  was her name?  Yes, Betty Dahms Lewis. Her children, when I started staying with  them, it didn   t seem like we were that close in age, but as we grew older  we realized that I was only three years older than Kermit, her son. I  guess the first time that really dawned on us was that first fall I was at  OSU. (Laughs) She was going to the National Home Economists  meeting and needed someone to stay. She didn   t want the children to be  by themselves the week she was gone, at home, and so she wanted me to  be able to stay with them. Of course, for me to leave the dorm I had to  have a letter (the dean required a letter), and particularly because of the  fact that Kermit was only three years younger than I was. (Laughs) So,  that was kind of different also, but we were very close.  That would have been 1964, if you graduated in Spring of    64?  7  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Yes, it would have been the fall of    64.  Which dorm did you live in?  Willard. I   m a Woman of Willard, like they   re referring to it now.  (Laughs)  Any decision to go to OU versus OSU? Was it always OSU?  It was always OSU. I think because of the 4-H background, going to 4-H  Roundup, and being on the campus, it was just a given when it was time  to go to college. Of course, I always referred to her as Mrs. Dahms, even  after I started to work with Extension. It was hard for me to say Betty.  (Laughs) She was a real support in helping both my sister and I apply for  scholarships and get campus work and so forth.  You worked at the Telephone Exchange. Where was that on campus?  It was on the fourth floor of the Animal Science building, just west of  the library.  Is that building still there?  Well, I think maybe it is. I don   t think it   s Animal Science now.  Was it all just women that did that job?  Yes, the best I can remember.  Was there a dress code?  I think there was, I don   t really remember. I think we pretty much wore  dresses, even to class and all, though I don   t think we wore slacks that  much. (Laughs) I   m not positive about that, but I also remember I had  one class in the University Auditorium before I went to work, and  twenty minutes was not enough time to really truck it over there and  then walk up four flights of stairs. (Laughs) You were panting and out of  breath even though you were young at the time.  Do you remember a favorite professor?  Her name has escaped me right now, but the organic chemistry professor  was a woman. I took it in the summer time, made an A in it, which  everyone had said organic chemistry was really hard. I attribute it to the  fact that there were thirteen of us in the class, and she also did the lab.  So, that was a good experience. Organic chemistry was something that  8  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  all of the home economics majors hated. (Laughs)  But had to have?  Yes, they had to have it. Also, at the time, which I think is kind of  unique and different, you had to have four HPER classes, recreation or  health-type classes, and I did not swim. I had never learned to swim and  I was afraid of water. We didn   t have a swimming pool in Walters when  I was growing up, and I was really afraid of water. So, that first summer  I thought I might as well get it out of the way because home economics  required not only four, but one of them was to be swimming. So, I  thought I might as well do it. I enrolled in the class and there were two  other girls that didn   t know how to swim and didn   t like the water either.  Well, the second day of class we had to jump in water over our head,  which was really frantic for us. That first week of class, one of the girls  dropped the class. The second week of class, the other girl dropped the  class. I thought,    Oh, I need to stick with this     (Laughs) They weren   t  home economics majors, and I thought,    I   ve got to stick with this.     Well, I stayed in until the last day that you could drop without getting a  failing grade in the class, and I dropped it because it was making a  nervous wreck out of me, and I couldn   t concentrate on my other  classes. I went to the advisor and I said,    I am going to have to drop this  one.    She agreed it was probably best for me then, but she said I don   t  know what we are going to do because it is required. She said,    You can  try taking four other HPER classes, but until you have a graduation  check when you   re ready to graduate, we don   t know how it will turn  out.    So, I took four others, and luckily when I had graduation check it  was okay and I didn   t have to take swimming, but I thought about it the  entire time I was working on my degree. (Laughs)  You dreaded it for three years.  Right. I took Archery and Riflery, which was kind of out of my realm,  but I got through it. (Laughs) I also took Bowling, Dancing   some type  of dancing   and Body Aerobics.  The archery may have come in handy with 4-H boys down the road.  Well yes, and it was a good education for me because the riflery part of  the class was taught by an ROTC instructor, and the guns were so heavy.  From day one, he would have us in a position holding the gun and he  would start talking, and here you are, holding the gun. It was so heavy   It was not until Thanksgiving when I (I took it in the fall) went home for  the holiday. I wanted to go out to the farm, where my dad   s brother still  lived, to practice. My dad wasn   t a real hunter. I mean, he had been in  9  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  the army and was around guns somewhat, and so was his brother, but  neither one of them hunted. Even if they did they didn   t know more than  I did about guns. (Laughs) We went out to practice and it was not until  they were trying to help me that I realized that there was a site on the  back of the gun. I was just aiming and looking at the target and firing,  because that hadn   t been covered. I guess it was a given with the ROTC  person. (Laughs) My targets improved a bit after I went back from  Thanksgiving.  It sounds like you had a good time at OSU.  Yes.  Did you have to do the practice house?  Yes, the home management house. A story I remember about that was  when I was in charge. We had three different budgets during the time  you were in the house: a high budget, a medium budget, and a low  budget, that your meals had to be planned on. When I was in charge of  the low budget, I forgot when we bought groceries for some reason, I  couldn   t get the chicken where we were buying everything else. I totally  forgot about the chicken until we had gotten everything, and then we  barely had enough to get the chicken to finish out our menu for the  week. (Laughs) I remember that about the house, and how the telephone  company told us to quit using disinfectant on the telephone receivers  because we were wearing the surface off of them. That was part of our  procedure. (Laughs) I was trying to think if there was something else.  I remember practicing, like you had to have a dinner with some of the  professors, guests and all, and it was over the six weeks I was in the  house covering the wintertime. I remember when we were practicing for  the dinner, different ones in the house were playing different roles.  There was a lot of snow on the ground and we had to go outside and  pretend like we were arriving   the guest. There was some glitch inside  and those of us that were outside were out there forever, and of course  we had not worn any coats or anything, because we were just going to  step out and back in, but was a fun time. They usually used graduate  students to be the house person in the house. I was in on Monroe, but  they quit using that as a home management house a long time ago, I  think.  So, there were two?  Yes. Well no, I think they were using both of them for a period of time.  They had a newer one, I believe, and then the older house on Monroe. I  can   t remember the young lady   s name. I   m sure she was very nice and  10  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  doing the job she was supposed to be doing, but everyone in the house  really thought she was mean. (Laughs) You had to make sure you  vacuumed everywhere because things would be hidden under the  cushions of the sofa or under the sofa, to check to see if you were taking  care of everything. I remember polishing the wood floors, solid wood  floors.  Gosh, they made you do everything then, didn   t they?  Oh, yes, yes.  Better than what you would do at home, it sounds like.  Yes, and I   m not positive, but I don   t think they have the house  anymore.  No, I don   t think they do either.  Now, there for a period of time, I think you didn   t have to live in the  house, you just spent daytime in the house.  Well, did you also have to do teaching, like a practicum for teaching in  addition to the practice house?  Yes, we had the practicum, which was three days, and then we had  student teaching also. I did my practicum at Newkirk and then my  student teaching was at Kingfisher. The girl who, she and I were  partners (they always sent home economics in pairs), we were the first  ones. The home economics teacher at Kingfisher had been there forever,  I think. She informed us when we went to visit, when we first found out  we were going there, that the student teachers always stayed with her.  She had a large house, two-story, with bedrooms and all. Sharon  particularly didn   t want to. I mean, she just absolutely refused, so I went  along with her. We told her we were going to get an apartment. (Laughs)  I don   t think that pleased her too much, but you know, we had heard a  lot about her and we didn   t want to spend our day and night with her. So  we found an apartment that actually had just been renovated into  apartments, but it was new-like. They were willing to rent to us just for  six weeks because they were just getting started. It was a kind of  different experience. I think I made mostly As, but I think both of us  made a B in student teaching, which we were probably lucky to get the  B with her. I don   t know. (Laughs)  You graduated and went to work immediately, almost, as a teacher?  Yes, and after I had taught two years, Extension called and they were  11  hiring and asked if I would like to interview. But at the time, I thought,     You know, I   m only getting to the point I feel really comfortable. I  want to work for Extension but I   m not ready to switch right now.    So, I  stayed with teaching and I spent the four years in Crescent. I did  interview at Cashion, I think at the end of the third year. That was kind  of a different type of interview. I mean, maybe they did all of them that  way at that time, but you had to interview with the entire school board.  Here they were all sitting around this big table talking to you. The main  reason I interviewed in the first place, another couple that taught at  Crescent, or he was the science teacher at Crescent and she drove to  Cashion as science teacher, lived next door to the little house that I was  renting. She really encouraged me to apply, so I did, but they wound up  hiring the daughter of the former teacher who was retiring, so that kind  of worked out alright.  The next year, I met my first husband. I had seen him before, we went to  the same church but we hadn   t dated. He was finishing a master   s at  OSU and wanted to pursue a doctorate, but also, before he left  Oklahoma for some place to work on his doctorate, he wanted to marry  an Oklahoman. (Laughs) I guess we first went out in October and we  were married that June. He finished his master   s in May, I resigned, and  we were married in June. He had applied for graduate schools and was  offered an assistantship at the University of Michigan and the University  of Maryland. He really wanted the University of Texas, but they didn   t  come through at the time with an assistantship. At the time we became  engaged and were planning the wedding, we didn   t know where we were  going to be. Of course, my nature was pretty organizational and planning  is really important to me. The teachers at Crescent couldn   t believe I was  planning to marry and didn   t even know where I was going to live or  where we were going to end up. (Laughs)  It turned out okay, and we decided to go to Maryland. I had thought that  I would probably teach, but I checked into it and you have to apply to  the county, and neither one of us had actually been out of Oklahoma that  much traveling, much less to live. We were pretty scared arriving at the  University of Maryland, which is like seven miles from DC. (Laughs)  So, we were a little bit leery about driving, and I certainly didn   t want to  have a school clear across the county that I would have to drive to. So, I  gave up that and decided to substitute. There was a school just down the  street from our apartment and we met one of the teachers at church. She  encouraged me to apply to substitute, which I did. They called me real  quick and wanted me to do science and other things besides home  economics, which I had had a pretty good background in science, and so  I agreed to it.  That went well for the first semester, I guess. Shortly into the second  12  semester the school had a big truancy problem. There was a shopping  center less than a mile from the school, so the students who were bused  in from all over the county would ride the bus to school, get off the bus  and go to the shopping center, spend the day, come back, get on the bus,  then go home. I opened the grade book when I first started and I saw  these As. My first thought was,    Boy, these are good students     Then I  realized they were absences everywhere. Shortly after the second  semester started I was in a science class lecturing, and this student who  was a head taller than I was stood up, got right in my face, and told me  to shut up. You know, this was the early seventies. I didn   t know where I  stood as a substitute. Luckily, I just looked at a girl on the first row and I  don   t recall the principal   s name, but I said,    Will you go get him?    She  got up and went after the principal. Had she not done that, I don   t know  what I would have done. (Laughs) He came down and straightened  things out for the day. When I went home and told David about it, he  said,    Well, you don   t need to go back. We don   t need the money that  bad.     After that happened, I looked for work on campus and I started to work  at the Department of Continuing Education on campus. I was  supervising student workers. I stayed there until we were there three  years, until October of that fall. My husband had a little glitch in his  dissertation, so it extended a little bit into the fall, but he finished at the  end of October. Of course, he had interviewed for some positions and  there were not a lot of positions at that time either because of the  economy and all. There was an opening in New Hampshire, and his  advisor suggested that he apply for it. He came home and talked to me  and we decided that, no, we wanted to go back toward Oklahoma, not  further north. So, he went back and told his advisor. His advisor said,    I  really think you should give this another thought, because there aren   t  that many jobs out there. You   ve gone to school all this time, and you  need a job.    So, we joked about it and thought,    Well, why not go for  the interview? You won   t be offered the position.    (Laughs) Well, he  went to the interview and he was offered the position, so then we had to  tell our parents. My dad had passed away, but mother was still living and  she wasn   t real happy, but it was okay with her. David   s parents were  really unhappy about it, but he said,    It   s a job. We   ve got to have a  job.    His dad wanted us to just come back to the farm and that wasn   t     You know, they were willing   they had built a new house and they said,     You can have the other house,    which was a nice brick home a half  mile  away . (Laughs) We said,    No, we aren   t doing that.     So, we went ahead and moved to New Hampshire, and it was a really  great experience. We were there about two years. We learned a lot, it   s a  beautiful place to live, and the one thing about snow versus Oklahoma  (because we were real concerned about the weather and driving and all).  13  They told us,    If you can wait thirty minutes when snow or whatever  starts falling, there is no problem.    And there isn   t. I mean, the snow  plows are out, things are cleared. So, it was a good experience.  Then a position came open in Texas. We were expecting a baby at the  time, so David applied for the position and went to Texas for the  interview and got the job. We moved in April of    76, mid-April. May 7,  our son was full term but he was stillborn. That was a big crisis. We  thought new job, new home   we had purchased a home   starting a  family, close to our parents, and things are going really well, but that  happened. Then, at the end of September, David died. I didn   t know  what to do at the time, and of course I was in Texas and all my family  was in Oklahoma. I couldn   t just instantly leave, we had a home there  and a mortgage and I wasn   t working at the time. I started applying with  Extension then because that is really what I wanted to do in Oklahoma.  The first interview they called me for   and it was several months  because there were not that many openings   was Coalgate, which I was  still young enough at the time, I was thirty and I had all this in my mind.  We had bought a lot of antiques when we were in New Hampshire and I  thought,    What am I going to do with everything?    I went for the  interview and when I drove into town, I thought,    Oh, this is so  depressing.    I had never been there. So, in the course of the interview  they asked if I would take the job if I was offered it, and of course, I  knew how you   re supposed to interview and what you don   t say, and I  thought,    Oh my goodness.    I thought real fast and I said,    Well, I really  can   t answer that because I haven   t been offered the job. If I   m offered  the job, I will give it some thought.    So, I got past that and went back to  Texas. In a couple of weeks, I heard from them. The secretary in the  office had a home economics degree and she had applied as well, so she  was hired. Which I thought,    Oh, that   s good.    (Laughs)  Well, a few months went by and they called about a position in the  Panhandle. The same thought went through my mind.    I don   t really  want to move to the Panhandle. I have all this stuff. What am I going to  do if I put it in storage? I   m living temporary and all.    But Betty Dahms  really said,    Janie, you need to think about this because after you get in,  then you will have a better opportunity to move.    I gave that thought but  I decided I just can   t do this. I mean, so much had happened to me in  such a short time. I just thought,    I can   t.    So, I said no to coming for  the interview. Well, Mr. Powell, who was the District Director at the  time, was very persistent. He called me four times and the fourth time he  called me he offered me the position over the phone. I had not even met  the man. Of course I said no. (Laughs) Then I decided I would pursue  graduate school. I came to OSU, filled out applications, and was  accepted and received an assistantship with Dr.  Bettye  Gaffney at the  14  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  time, in the home economics department.  I went back to Texas   this was early summer, that year I guess   and  was putting my house up for sale and was planning to move and all, and  in just a few weeks time, I received a call about the Oklahoma County  position. I told them I had accepted the assistantship and they said,    Is  that really what you want to do?    I said,    Well, I don   t know.    So, I  contacted Dr. Gaffney and went up and visited with her, because I   m not  one to go back on what I   ve said I   ll do. I had signed papers and all for  the assistantship, and she said,    This is your life and you really need to  make the decision of what   s best for you at this time.    I explained that I  hated the fact I had already agreed to it and knocked other people out  and all, and she said,    That   s not a problem because we had several  applicants. We can call on someone else and it will be filled, and that   s  okay.    After she told me that, I guess I had already interviewed, but I  really didn   t know what I wanted to do. At the same time, I told myself,     I need to start on my master   s,    because I knew I had heard people say  you get started in Extension and it   s really hard because the job can be  more than full time. It   s really hard then to set aside time to go back to  school and work on an advanced degree.  My goal at the time was to start work in August, and start classes at  OSU. So, I started on August 1 of 1977, and I think classes started the  last week in August that year. I continued to take classes and luckily,  about that time, they started doing some all day Friday and Saturday  workshops for Extension that met, I think, once a month, so I was  enrolled in some of that. I didn   t have to take too many night classes. I  had a few night classes that I would work until about three o    clock and  then drive up, go to class, and come home and be at work the next  morning. Then I used educational leave and some vacation time two  summers I guess. I started in the fall of    77 and I finished in May of    80.  That   s pretty good, working full time and actually graduating.  Yes, so that was a goal.  How much educational leave would they give you?  We had two weeks.  Two weeks to be used at one time, or spread out over time?  You could use it however you chose. Now, I am thinking maybe, you  could accumulate up to four weeks too, I   m not positive. Like, if you  didn   t use it one year, I   m not sure, but anyway it worked out pretty  good. I may have had to use a little annual leave, I   m not sure.  15  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  So, your first job was in 1977 in Oklahoma County?  Yes, went to camp that first week and had the county fair the second.  (Laughs) The first two weeks of that I stayed with friends in Crescent  and drove back and forth, because the house I had bought, we couldn   t  close on it until mid-August.  You managed pretty well to handle all of that. So where was your office  in Oklahoma County?  Tenth and Portland.  Is that the courthouse, or is it just a   ?  Oh no, I   m sorry. You   re not familiar with the county.  No, I   m not.  No, it originally was on the east side of the county, and then the county  bought this property. I think the office   there is a cornerstone at the  office and I can   t quite remember, but it was a number of years before  probably in the thirties or forties that it was built there. It really needs to  be replaced. There was a bond issue a couple of years ago I guess, but it  didn   t pass. In an urban area, it   s really hard for people to recognize the  Extension program and what it does.  And it was 4-H?  Yes, yes.  And had you helped with the county? I   m assuming that you had at least  participated in county fairs as a high school student     Yes, yes. I had always been in     But as far as planning or organizing?  No, and most of that year I will say, plans were already in place. My job  was just to carry them out back to the poultry barbeque, the judges that  had already selected and all. (Laughs) But at that time, camp was a week  long. I reported for work that Monday morning, we got on the bus and  went to Red Rock Canyon for camp, and were there until Friday  afternoon, which was a unique experience because I knew no one. I had  to get to know the kids and the volunteer parents that were there.  16  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  It had to be a little bit of fun though, too.  Oh yes, yes it was. Early in my career, I guess   well I finished my  master   s in May of    80, and I guess it was in August of    80   I was one  of the six chaperones that took fifty-two 4-H-ers to Japan for seven  weeks. When I had applied for that, it just sounded really interesting to  me. When it came across the desk, I thought,    I would like to do this.     Well, I went in and talked to L.B. McClure, the county director, about it.  Of course, he remembered Pearl Harbor and all and he looked at me and  he said,    Oh, Janie, you don   t want to do that.    (Laughs) I said,    Yes, I  really do.    So I filled out the application and sent it in. It was several  weeks, maybe months, during the process of getting applications and  reviewing them. I happened to be out of the office for an in-service or  something when they called, so they talked to him. Well, a couple days  later, I was back in the office and I got a phone call. They were asking  me a question, something about the trip. I said,    Well, I don   t know  anything about this.    (Laughs) After I hung up, I went in to ask him and  he said,    Oh, yes, they called.    He had failed to even tell me that I got to  go. That was a wonderful experience.  The previous year Oklahoma had hosted Japanese students. It was called  the Labo Program, which was a language laboratory-type learning  experience. It was set up so you hosted one year, and you went the next  year. In Oklahoma County, we had hosted that first year   oh, I   m  thinking like twelve or fifteen   we hosted a good proportion of the  group that came, and one of the chaperones stayed with me. You know, I  had some vested interest in it, and it was a really great experience.  Did you get to do that again   a different place?  Well, Oklahoma continued the program for a number of years and  Oklahoma County continued to host. I didn   t go again, but I had a  volunteer whose daughter wanted to go, and so he applied to go and he  was selected as one of the chaperones and went.  How many 4-H clubs did you have under your charge when you first  started?  Our numbers really fluctuated. I think about twenty-five was the most  clubs we ever had. We had more clubs when I first started than toward  the end of my career, because some of our clubs consolidated, a few of  them fell by the wayside. A real drawback to 4-H volunteering, if the  educator doesn   t keep a handle on it    Regardless of how hard you try,  sometimes it happens anyway, that you have volunteers with a club that  continue as the volunteers of that particular group for twenty-plus years  all the way through the time of several children of their own. You may  17  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  think that is all great and good, but when it comes time that they want to  step out of that role, then it   s very hard to find a replacement.  We actually had a club on the east side of the county that just disbanded.  I carried the club for almost two years, going every month and meeting  with them, but we couldn   t find any adults that were willing to step  forward. That   s not the county educator   s job to operate an individual  club. We had to finally just let it disband, and those few that were  interested go to another club, but that is the drawback. Everyone would  say,    I can   t do what she did and therefore I   m       Which you would try  to explain,    You don   t need to do that. That is not good. If you can just  take the role for a year, or a couple of years, and then someone else be  willing to take the main leadership       This particular person had done  most everything herself and didn   t involve other parents. That   s the ideal  model, is having one person that sort of coordinates, but they don   t do it  all themselves. They involve all these others helping, and then you rotate  those roles. We really try to focus on that being the model for most of  our clubs.  Do some leadership and delegation.  Yes, yes. And of course we had   and this is true, I think, in most  counties   you have some clubs that do a variety of projects. They are  like a multi-purpose club and the boys and girls can enroll in anything  they are interested in. Ideally, you have volunteers that will work with  those enrolled in the home economics type related projects, someone  else to work with those in the agriculture type projects, and maybe  horticulture, electronics, and the various areas. But then we also had  several clubs in Oklahoma County that were just one purpose clubs.  Like a sewing club?  Yes, Horticulture Club was a really involved club when I first started to  work. You may be familiar with the name Moesel, which had the garden  center for a long number of years on Tenth Street, close to the office.  Rodd Moesel is the past president of the 4-H Foundation. He was one of  their sons, and it was Dick and Marjorie Moesel and they were the  leaders of the Horticulture Club. The kids had great experiences because  they had the garden center to work with. We had sewing clubs, we had a  Rabbit Club at one time, Riflery Club, Dog Club, and we had a Food  Nutrition Club. It didn   t last too long just as an isolated club. It worked a  little bit better when there were several.  Well, with a specialty club like that, would children come from the entire  county?  18  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Yes, some of them would. Some of them were a little bit more focused  on the particular geographic area they were in.  And these would compete at the county fair for ribbons or whatever. And  then did they go onto the next level?  Yes, we always had participants in the state fair. We had judging teams  also, county judging teams, that participated with consumer education  and also at the livestock judging competition that goes on the county  fair.  Meat judging?  Yes, meat judging was big when I started to work. When I started to  work, Bruce Bigger was one of the other   there were four of us with the  Youth Development Program in 1977. It   s down to three now.  Meat judging is not as   ?  No, now in some of the counties, I think they still do meat judging, but  our boys and girls kind of lost interest in it or we dwindled down to not  enough to work with it. Meat judging is pretty intense if you want to do  well with it. I had done a little meat judging as a 4-H-er and remembered  coming to Oklahoma City and going in the cold locker plant, in the  freezer, to judge the meat. (Laughs) You always had to wear your coat,  so that was a neat experience.  And fair time was competitive? Really competitive I   d say.  Yes, we always had the building exhibits, which were the home  economics type of exhibits: horticulture, photography, electronics, those  types of things, and then the animal exhibits. At the county fair, most of  the time I worked   we had a county fair-style show that we kind of  highlighted. We called it a back-to-school style show. Sometimes the  students, a good majority of the time, would model things they made,  but not necessarily for those that didn   t. They could participate just with  back-to-school wear, so it was a fun time.  Were the buildings at the fair air conditioned at that time, when you first  started back in the seventies?  Yes, because we had our county fair at the state fairgrounds.  That makes a difference.  Yes, it makes a great deal of difference compared to some of the small  19  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  counties. (Laughs) Now, we have been upgraded a little bit since I  started to work because initially, we were in the Made in Oklahoma  building, which was not the best air conditioning. It was a pretty dirty  building. Initially, when I started, we used   I don   t even think they are  around now, I don   t think they even use them in the Hobbies, Arts and  Crafts building. The fair had a lot of these wooden cases that had glass  doors with a lot of glass on them. We would use those for all of our food  exhibits. Well, the county fair was prior to the state fair, so I think they  depended on us to clean the things up because they would be put in  storage after the state fair. They would deliver them to us prior to the  county fair, over to the Made in Oklahoma building, and we   d start  cleaning on those things. You would find dead birds in the cases and the  doors didn   t close well. (Laughs) So, finally, I think before we left the  Made in Oklahoma building, we quit using those cases. We would just  put our food on the table.  We had to do all the preparing, set up for the county fair, the staff did.  After a few years into it we were able to make connections with the  county jail and they brought inmates out. Now, they would always send  an officer with them, plus they told us to count our scissors before we  started and right when we ended. (Laughs) I mean, we would be there to  help them and kind of supervise there, work with them. We used scissors  to cut the paper, because we covered all the tables with paper and  skirting around. One year, it was prior to the centennial, I think it was  the year they were building a big sand castle model in the entry of the  Made in Oklahoma building. Of course, that had to be started months in  advance of the state fair. That was the year we got to move. First they  just told us we couldn   t use the state fairgrounds. Well, we didn   t have  any place to go. After negotiating, we got moved to the Kitchens of  America building at the time, now it   s called something else, I think it   s  called Centennial. It   s the building to the west of the Hobbies, Arts, and  Crafts building. You may not be familiar with any of these places, but  anyway, it was a very good upgrade, a huge area with a beautiful ceiling.  It   s kind of an arch shaped, wood-type ceiling and the light fixtures  make it almost look like stars in the ceiling. It   s much nicer than the  Made in Oklahoma because it was that old, blown on, acoustical stuff.  Anyway, that   s where the Oklahoma county fairs have been held.  So, you   d have to get there pretty early to set up? Those would be long  days.  Well, we had to pay, it came out of county budget, for using it, and so  we usually went in on Tuesday. The fair opened and we had Tuesday  and Wednesday to set up, and then start taking exhibits on Thursday.  Did you have a favorite part of the job?  20  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  This may sound kind of strange, but I guess my favorite part is the fact  that every day is a new and different day with Extension versus teaching.  You know, you get into a routine with classroom teaching. Of course,  you have your lesson plans, and your classes, this is going to occur  today, and so forth. Every day in Extension is totally  different . You  have a plan, but the plan may quickly be changed, depending on the day.  Not a typical day.  I think just meeting a lot of really neat families, and for the most part I  think the families were really supportive and wanted their children to do  the right thing. Of course, we did have some to deal with that  occasionally you would say,    If I just had the children or the teenagers  to work with, and didn   t have to be involved with the parents, everything  would go much better.    (Laughs) Sometimes parents would interject to  the point of creating problems with a child, whereas if it were just the  child and the educator you could have easily worked it out.  I had a bad experience once at the 4-H Achievement Banquet from a  family that the dad was just determined the daughter would receive Hall  of Fame, which was our top county award each year, and we awarded  two every year. Often times a boy and a girl, but it did not have to be a  boy and a girl. Of course, it varied from year to year, and what I always  tried to instill in the young people was,    Do your very best and compete  with yourself. It doesn   t matter if you win or lose. The most important  thing is that you have done the best you could do, at the time.    If you  start with them young enough, the boys and girls seem to accept that and  be willing to go with it, but sometimes you have parents involved in the  situation. This particular year, the dad just knew the daughter was  getting Hall of Fame. I always used out of county judges. Over the  period of years of being in the program, if the family is involved at the  district or state level they get to know educators in other counties and  sometimes get very friendly with those people. So, I always tried to be  careful when I knew who was in the running for the Hall of Fame, to  carefully select the judges. I never did any interjecting as far as decision  making, which I have judged in other counties. There have been times  when there has been some influence, so to speak, on you as a judge. But,  I didn   t like that and I always made sure that didn   t happen in Oklahoma  County.  Well, this particular year our banquet was out at the Eastern Oklahoma  County Vo-tech Center in Choctaw. I will never forget that night. We  were at round tables, we had had a nice banquet meal, were proceeding  with the program, and the Hall of Fame was the very last announcement.  We come to the Hall of Fame and the announcement is made. This  21  Finchum  Morrow  family happened to be sitting at the table right behind me. That was  before I had remarried, so I was there by myself, so to speak. The dad  jumped up from the table, slung his camera down on the table, and left.  Well, it scared me to death because I didn   t know what would occur. We  went on through the program and there wasn   t much more because we  were right toward the end. Luckily, the bookkeeper in our office, her  children were involved in the program and she and I were pretty close,  they were there as a family. She was sitting close enough that she saw  what happened. After it was over, people were leaving and we started  cleaning up, she came up to me and said,    Janie, we are not leaving.  Robert and I are helping you pick up everything and we are not leaving  until you leave because I   m afraid he might come back.    (Laughs)  Well, there was a high set of stairs as you go into the building and then  you park down below that. We had made several trips in and out, taking  decorations and things, and we were on the last group and it was  something small, so she and I went back into the building to get  whatever it was and Robert, her husband, was standing down by the car.  This man came back and started up the steps, then he turned around,  went back to his car, and left. So, we got the last things in and she said,     I want you to call me as soon as you get home.    (Laughs) Because they  lived on the south side and I lived northwest, so I called her and told her  I got home fine. But the next Monday morning, he came into the office  and we went into the County Director   s office and sat down for a  discussion. After he left, the County Director said,    I was absolutely  scared to death he was going to have a heart attack while he was in here  because he was so nervous.    We got past that. The daughter, I think it  was a couple years later, received Hall of Fame. Then after she  graduated, a few years after that, she called and told me she would like  to sponsor an award. She could have accepted the whole thing very  nicely, if her dad had not made such an issue of it. Working as a youth  worker, you really get into a lot of family dynamics, but I enjoyed my  entire career. (Laughs)  Do they give you some training to handle things like that?  Oh yes, we   ve had in-services on how to fire a volunteer, how to deal  with volunteers. You know, volunteers need to be looked at somewhat as  employees, even though they are not being paid, because they do have  responsibilities. But there are also expectations that the supervisor or so  forth has of them. Over the years of my career, the state office became  more and more involved in developing a system of certifying volunteers.  Now, to my knowledge, I guess that   s still somewhat in place. They  have to meet a certain number of in-service type training, not only that  the educators have, but also training for volunteers. They can   t just sign  on as a volunteer and do their own thing and never have that much  22  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  contact with the office.  You still had to know how to manage and handle, negotiate anywhere  from six or seven year olds to forty plus, I guess?  Yes, and you get to meet some really wonderful people.  Did any of your 4-H students go on to be Extension agents?  I   m trying to think. I don   t think I have any right now that are Extension  agents. I had one young lady who from the time she started in 4-H, she  sort of stayed close to me, and she recently wrote me a beautiful letter  about how I had mentored her. She was really interested in becoming an  Extension educator. A similar thing happened to her as to me, when she  first graduated and was looking for a job. She met her fianc   and got  married immediately on receiving her home economics degree. He   s a  little older than she is and has a law degree and was working here in  Oklahoma City with the Pardon and Parole Board, so he was not mobile.  That created an issue with her because that was before I had retired. So,  there wasn   t a position for her here.  She did apply to teach and started teaching and does a wonderful job.  When I was getting ready to retire, because we had stayed in contact the  entire time and I had helped in her classroom with a number of things,  we talked about it, and she thought about it, but she too had really gotten  into teaching. She has a real talent for helping with the underprivileged,  or so to speak, troubled students. She started out at Capitol Hill, which if  anyone that knows the Oklahoma City system, that   s a very rough high  school to start out at. So, she was there, then Douglass, she went to  Douglass, and that   s the same situation. Then, the teacher left and she  interviewed and got the position at Emerson Alternative School, which  is a downtown school. It   s at Sixth and Walker, I believe. It   s for  troubled youth and pregnant teens, and she really does a wonderful job  with the girls. I had gotten more involved with her classroom after I  retired.  One of the workshops that I sort of wrote the curriculum and developed  when I was working was on manners, and I started it. Now there are  several places that do teaching along that line for students, but at the  time, it was very hard to find resources because there wasn   t that much  material. So, I did a summer series from kindergarten through high  school, and I partnered with different restaurants for the kindergarten  through second grade. I did it at a tea room. For third, fourth, and fifth  grade, I did it at an Italian restaurant. For sixth, seventh, and eighth  grade I did it at the ballpark, the restaurant that you can see out the back  of it onto the ballpark, downtown. I called that one Hitting Homeruns or  23  Finchum  Morrow  Fouls from the Table. I had cutesy names for each of them. The high  school class was at what is the Hilton now, downtown. We did Social  Savvy for it. But I was kind of known for those classes, and so I started  teaching them for her students. So, I do that, and I   ve done some other  types of lessons for her, as well as I make taco soup every year and take  for the girls to have soup one day during class.  I   ve done some extended things with her, also. I   ve gone to the food  bank with them, to work at the food bank. One year, I went to the  regional FCCLA  Family, Career and Community Leaders of America  conference . It includes business and home economics and a number of  those areas. We went to the regional conference in Albuquerque and  took thirteen girls. She needed another chaperone and of course, the girls  come from backgrounds that the parents aren   t options for chaperones,  and so I went with her. We stayed in the conference hotel, which was a  very high class hotel. Most of the girls had never been in a hotel before.  They had never eaten at a nice restaurant. We took them to a nice  restaurant and we had a manners class when we were eating that night  about the different courses. It was really a wonderful experience.  She has gotten so ingrained in that, oh, I think she   ll probably stick with  it. It   s an ideal situation for her. She and her husband live in Heritage  Hills, so the school is really close. They have two young boys now that  are in schools right close, so it   s a little bit better situation. Extension is  really hard for you if you have young children in a metropolitan county.  Now, I think in a smaller county, you may be able to adapt a little bit  more for after school care, extended hours and weekends with an  Extension job. In a metropolitan area, it makes it much more difficult,  particularly when the dad travels some, too. So, I think she   ll probably  stick with what she   s doing. She was one of my star 4-H   ers, I think.  I   ve had some others as well.  When you started in    77, when did you get married again?  In    87. I was a widow for eleven years. I tell my husband it was almost  too long, because I had gotten used to being really independent again.  (Laughs) But, we have a wonderful life together. He had two children, a  son and a daughter. So, we have seen them grow up, graduate, and finish  college degrees. His daughter is an RN  Registered Nurse , and has a  son who is a junior at Kansas, K-State in Manhattan. The son is in  Wichita. He   s a researcher with Cargill Meat Company and his wife has  a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management, and had been in the  management-end of some hotels, but left that. Right now, she   s  managing a scrapbooking store, which fits in a little bit better with their  family, hour-wise. They have nine year old twins, a boy and a girl, and  an eleven year old son. Even though my life didn   t turn out like I  24  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  envisioned it in high school, having children, birth children, it all has  worked out very nicely, and I feel very fortunate to have met Darrell. He  was a journalist and was with The Oklahoman at the time we met.  Were you doing articles or news snip-its for your projects at that time?  Well yes, but actually how we met, another lady talked me into taking  square dance lessons. Which, at the time, I thought,    Oh, I don   t want to  do that.    Cathy said,    Oh, it   ll be fun, Janie.    So, we decided to take  lessons and Darrell had already taken lessons, but they were always  short on men. So, they invited the men to come back at no charge, to  help with the classes, and that   s how we met. We took about three and a  half years to decide, but we   ve had a really neat life together.  So your first ten or so years with Extension, you didn   t have to juggle a  family.  Right, right.  And it wasn   t a forty hour a week job?  Oh no. In fact, I made it full time   which I needed to. I needed a lot to  occupy my time at that point. I think that   s why I wanted to work on the  master   s also.  Any thoughts of switching counties or moving into the adult program?  Well, I had a relative that I mentioned a time or two to her, about I  thought I might see about applying to the adult program. Her comment  was,    Oh Janie, you don   t want to work with those old women.     (Laughs) So, she really thought the youth program was what I needed. I  did apply a few times, but you get to thinking about it and think,    Well, I  might like to try something different.    Twenty-six years is a long time to  be staying in one place.  My immediate co-workers in the youth program did change quite a bit,  but a lot of our other staff didn   t. Now, most of us have retired. He  wasn   t there when I first started to work, but it wasn   t too many years  into my work that he started, Ray Ridlen, who works with agriculture  and horticulture still is in the office. But, all the rest of us have retired  out I think. (Laughs) We were all long-termers there. So, sometimes it  crosses your mind,    I might like a new mix, or shake-up.    So, I did  apply a few times.  One time, I applied for a district position at Duncan. I really thought that  was what I wanted. That was after I had remarried. My mother, at the  25  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  time, was still in Walters. I thought,    Well, that would be a lot closer to  her.    So, I applied, but I didn   t get the position and I told myself later,  with some things that happened,    You know, everything turns out for a  reason.    I think it actually did. So, I was glad I stayed where I was.  Then at one time, I applied for the adult program in Canadian County  and was actually offered the position. In the final negotiating, I decided  against it because there wasn   t going to be any salary increase, and the  main thing was they were going to require me to move within three  months. I only lived three miles from the county line. Now, there   s  Yukon and El Reno, but still, the Canadian county line is there and you  can live anywhere in the county. So, I gave that a lot of serious thought,  but I decided,    I   ll have to change my whole strategy of doing things,  with going from youth program to adult program, no salary increase, and  having to move.    I   m well aware that the moving rules   some people  are in Extension that have gotten around that simply by not being fully  up front about things. But, that   s not my nature and I could not do that.  So, I said,    I   m sorry, but I just can   t agree to those terms.    So, I was  glad, even after that happened, that I stayed where I stayed.  Was that still a requirement where you have to live in the county you  work in?  It was when I retired. I don   t know how it is now, and I   ve had people  say,    That won   t stand up in court.    Well, I just don   t get into things like  that. I   m not the fighting-type to go that far with something. If someone  tells me this is the way it is, I pretty much accept it, if I want to do that  particular thing that that   s a rule for.  Did the district jobs go to men?  No, actually, it was a woman. She had more years in Extension than I  had. That actually happened to me twice because I had kind of forgotten  about this first one, but I did apply for a state position first, not too far  into my career. When it was available, I decided to apply. They were  very complimentary of my interview and all, and so I asked when they  called and told me. I totally, will always believe they never expected  such a question. But I said,    Well, can you tell me, then, what I need to  improve on for the next time?    And I think it was a total shock because  they did not know what to say. (Laughs) Finally, they told me,    Well,  the decision just boiled down to tenure.    You know, years of experience.  At the time, the other person that it was down to   because we had  already made the first cut, the two of us, through an interview, and we  had to do the second. I said,    You mean time with Extension, not total  experience?    Because we had exactly the same number of years of  experience, except four of my years were teaching. (Laughs) He had to  26  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  admit,    Well, yes.    Which, I guess, you can be a little bit bias. But in my  view, I considered the fact that I had the four years of teaching a broader  experience base because sometimes I think you can get too much tunnel  vision and not know what is going on on the outside. I retired very  happy, I was glad.  Four more years and you would have had thirty, is that right?  Yes, well I actually had thirty with teaching because I have teacher   s  retirement, also, so I had the thirty with that. I really wasn   t thinking of  retiring in 2003. I don   t know if you are familiar or not, but they offered  an early out because there was some funding difficulty. I gave it  considerable thought because it wasn   t an easy decision, but after the  fact with the economy and everything that   s happened and all, I think it  was a good thing. Particularly, when I put a pencil to it, my husband and  I talked about, actually with my teacher   s and my federal retirement, my  take home is fifty dollars less a month than when I was working.  You spend that on gas.  Gas, cloths, eating out, all kinds of things. Now, had my personal life  been different, I might not have made the decision, but if I had needed  work for contacts with people and all. There are a lot of things I enjoy  doing. In fact, I have gotten so heavily involved right after I retired that  now I am trying to phase out of a few things and be more of a participant  than in a leadership role. (Laughs) I think that can happen to you very  quickly. A lot of the retiring groups, the ones that are still somewhat  active in them, are really on the high-end, age-wise. They have already  served in roles, and so they don   t want to do anything more, and you  don   t have that many joiners. There are generations now that are not  joiners, so to speak, and in order to keep some of these things going,  those that are willing, you join something and very quickly they have a  job for you. (Laughs) In fact, right now, this year, I am serving as  president of the National Retired Federal Employees Chapter 184 that  meets in Oklahoma City.  So, you   re not really retired.  Well, no. (Laughs) I   ve got to know a lot of interesting people. Those of  us who have retired, there are a few maybe that are still working that are  on Federal Civil Service, but I think most of us have retired out. I  believe it was in    83 that they withdrew Extension from Federal Civil  Service and went to the FERS program. That   s a different type of  retirement.  Have you been to a county fair since you retired?  27  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Yes. I think it was the second year after I retired that we stepped into the  county fair. I think someone called me about it and had some entry or  something they wanted me to see, so I went. Well, not this county. Now,  I did judge those first few years still, a few county fairs. I still judged the  state fair   well, I say still   I only started judging the state fair after I  retired because they don   t use current employees. I judge in the 4-H and  youth area, and then also for the state fair itself. I   ve been judging in the  hobbies, arts and crafts in the youth area.  So, do you have a hobby, art, or a craft that you do?  Mainly I just love antiques. I used to do some craft work, some  needlework and all, but as your life advances, I think you become more  and more overwhelmed with things and clutter. Particularly, in the last  year or so, I   ve really been trying to work on clearing things. We are  doing major home remodeling, and so that has led to a good bit of it.  Now, when I see things I like, I enjoy them at the moment and I leave  them. I don   t think,    Oh, I have to have that.    (Laughs) I think you find  that happens.  Maybe applying some of the lessons you   ve taught to the children over  the years to make wise decisions, money management, and all that  coming into play.  That   s true. Relationships are much more important than things.  Do you stay in touch with some of your fellow 4-H Extension workers  through the years?  Yes. Also, this particular year, I am serving as president of the Faithful  Extension Workers, which are the women retirees. We meet twice a  year, usually in the fall. Sometimes it   s been an overnight, but lately  we   ve just been doing a day thing, and then in the spring in connection  with the Extension Home Economists annual meeting.  Before we close out we need to go back and talk a little bit about the 4-H  Roundup a little bit.  Well, as a 4-H   er, I went to Roundup. I guess I probably have been to  Roundup about thirty years, either as a 4-H   er or a as a chaperone with  4-H   ers.  How had it changed over that span of time, or had it much?  Well, some things have changed. Staying in the high-rise dorms were  28  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  really a neat thing, and hoping they got the high-rise ones. Of course, as  a chaperone taking 4-H   ers you would always be concerned about,     What floor are we going to wind up with this year?    (Laughs) With that  many there in the same schedule, it would be almost impossible to use  the elevators, or very difficult to use the elevators. So, if you wound up  on the thirteenth floor or so, it was a long trudge. (Laughs) I   m trying to  think, over time, not as intense competition in some of the areas at  Roundup as what I remembered as a 4-H   er, or when I was first taking  4-H   ers. I   m speaking more to public speaking contests, or  demonstrations, which the name was changed later to illustrated  presentations. Over the course of time, the different generations, I think,  are not into working up those presentations as much as they used to be  years ago. They want to go more for being a participant in workshops  and things, rather than competing by giving a speech, or an illustrated  presentation. They have had some athletic events the last few years that  the boys and girls can compete in, so it has changed that way.  Dances have kind of come to the forefront. When I was there as a 4-  H   er, we did a little square dancing, that was the thing. Ray Parker, if  you   ve heard that name, was a square dance leader. (Laughs) But, that  has moved into an important part of Roundup. The elections, I guess we  had officers when I went as a 4-H   er, state officers. I don   t really  remember about that. I don   t remember for sure the competing and  running, and all. Even when I first took 4-H   ers, I don   t remember that  so much, and of course, the Ambassador Program developed over the  years. I was working the statewide 4-H ambassadors, that their selection  takes place at Roundup. Scholarships have increased over the course of  time, which is good. Of course, the cost of going has increased also, so  equivalent wise, they may not be that much more as years ago. (Laughs)  They still seem to be popular.  Oh yes. The Hall of Fame winners for the state have always been a  highlight on Honor Night. Of course, the Honor Night Banquet came  about because, initially, it was a program. I don   t remember how many  years back the banquet was started for all of the top winners.  And the four H   s stand for what?  Head, heart, hands, and health. I used to use the illustrations with the  young ones. When you are helping them learn you start with the head,  heart, hands, and health is tougher. (Laughs) That   s a question even on  game shows. Sometimes that question pops up, and I think it   s amazing;  sometimes people don   t have a clue. (Laughs)  Well, that is still as appropriate today as it was when it started, what,  29  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  seventy-five to one hundred years ago?  Yes, and actually, when 4-H first began, hustle was in there. I can   t  remember which of the H   s it stood for. We used to really do the 4-H  creed. Well, the pledge is,    I pledge my head to clearer thinking, heart to  greater loyalty, hands to larger service, and health to better living for my  club, my community, my country,    and they added,    and my world.     But also, there was a 4-H creed that was back and forth between a leader  and 4-H   ers. When I first started to work, that was part of the opening  ceremony for clubs. But over the course of time, that has kind of fallen  by the wayside. Current 4-H   ers probably don   t even know it. (Laughs)  Do you remember any of it?  Well, not by heart. I think if I saw the beginning of it, I could rattle it  off.  I can look it up.  The fifth H is the home, I do know that. That   s part of it.  That would make sense, too. If you had to do it over again would you?  Oh, yes. I really enjoyed it. It was something that I decided in junior  high that I would really like to do. I wrote a high school paper on    Jill of  All Trades,    that   s what the title was. (Laughs) I kind of likened it to  being an Extension worker, and I say that because at the time, the  women were called home demonstration agents, when I was a 4-H   er.  We covered all areas of the home, and that was a real interest of mine.  You had to know a little bit about a lot of things.  Yes, and the first county director, L.B. McClure, that I had, his  philosophy was,    The most important thing is to know where to get it,  not necessarily to know the answer.    As a new employee, you aren   t too  far into the job when you realize that is very true, because you would be  amazed at the questions that you might be asked. You probably don   t  know the answer, but it   s important for you to know where to find the  answer, where to look for it, or where to research.  And tell them you   ll get back to them?  Right.  Would you get phone calls at home?  30  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  Occasionally, not as much, I think, in an urban county as I   m sure  probably occurred in the more rural-type counties, but occasionally.  Over the course of the twenty-six years I worked, I think twice I came  across 4-H families out and around the city, which to me I found very  unusual. All that time     Just to have two?  Yes, whereas I know in the smaller counties, there is interaction all the  time and, of course, the agents are   I don   t know that you call it  status   but they are well known in the county. That was never true here.  Most people, if it came up where you worked or what you did, you had  to fully explain. (Laughs) Of course, you had the opportunity to tell the  story a lot to people.  On your last day of work, do you have special memories of that day?  Well, I have a special memory of the third day before my last day. It   s  not a real good memory, but it changed my life a lot and I learned from  it. I had been going to the office a lot at night and on the weekend  because I was going through files, and I was taking things home with me  to go through and then take back. This was on a Monday, and I say it  was the third day before my last day because 4-H Educators Conference  was that Thursday and Friday, so I actually was only going to have three  days in the office that week, then go to conference, and that was it. On  this Monday, I arrived for work at Tenth and Portland and the Extension  Center is a one story building surrounded by OSU-OKC. The county has  the property that the Extension Center is on, and then it   s surrounded  otherwise. The building is a rectangle that has a corner out of it back  here, and there are like three parking spaces there, with a big satellite  dish, and three parking places. There   s a door that goes into the west end  of the building. Our county director always parked in the first slot, I  always parked in the second one, and whoever got there always parked  in the third one.  Well, I got there shortly after seven o    clock that morning, and the  county director   s van was already in that spot. Well, I pulled into the  spot I always park in. I had taken a lot of books and things home with  me, to mark things in or go through. So, I get out of the car, I put my  purse on my shoulder, and I scoop up all these books. I had my arms full  of the books. I slammed the door shut, and I was holding my keys, also.  I just sensed someone   s hands on my back, but it did not scare me  because usually, I glanced over to see if Bill had just driven up, was still  in his van. I didn   t remember glancing over that morning, so, I thought,     Who is trying to scare me on my last week of work?    So, I didn   t say  anything. All this happened in a course of seconds, but the next thing I  31  knew, they were tugging at my purse strap. It had a real wide strap. Of  course, I was holding the books so they couldn   t get the purse off. Well,  still that didn   t scare me because I thought,    Who is trying to play a trick  on me?    Well, the next thing I knew, I was on the ground, had been  pushed down, the books and everything went like that, (gestures) and  they got my purse off my arm. I moved my head like that, (gestures) just  in time to see this young man go around the corner by the satellite. He  had on black nylon pants and a white t-shirt, with my purse.  Well, where he pushed me down wasn   t good cement. Luckily, I had on  slacks. I kind of staggered up and I could feel blood on one of my knees.  It was just a few steps to the door, so I get over to the door and jerk the  door open. Well, Bill and Ray were coming up the hallway and I yell,     Call 9-1-1  Call 9-1-1    And they say,    What happened?    And I could  barely tell them. (Laughs) Well, Bill thinks he needs to call the county  because it   s county property. So, he doesn   t dial 9-1-1, he dials the  county sheriff, or calls the county sheriff   s office.  Anyway, I go into my office and I dial the phone, I   m trying to get  Darrell. Well, first I couldn   t get the phone to work, maybe I punched  something wrong, I don   t know. (Laughs) Anyway, I finally get Darrell  and I tell him what happened. He was on his way to Edmond, he says,     Okay, I   ll come. I   ll be there.    So I hang up. Well, it is forty-five  minutes before the county sheriff gets there. In the meantime, Gail  Goodner, the media specialist at the office, had gotten there. So, she  took me back to the workroom. My hand had started swelling up,  because this hand had hit really hard. (Gestures) I guess it was my ring  that caused it. So, she put ice on my hand and I had a cut or two on my  hand, my knee was all bruised, so we were trying to take care of that.  Finally the sheriff gets there, and so we start talking to him. By this time,  the person is already who knows where. The Police Training Center was  a half mile down the street. You know, if they   d just called 9-1-1.  (Laughs) But anyway, the sheriff   s deputies started going over with me  what all was in my purse. I was carrying my social security card, which  you are not supposed to carry, my driver   s license, my credit cards. I had  a lot of rebate things from the credit card for Border   s bookstore, like the  five dollar certificates they used to send you. I had like  150 of those,  had cash, all kinds of things, and my cell phone. Well, the deputy said  that the cell phone you want to call on immediately. My husband got  there before the sheriff   s deputy even got there. (Laughs) He had already  called on the cell phone, to stop it. But what he told us was that at that  time   now, it may be different now   but at that time, on the cell phone,  he said,    That is the first thing you want to call about because the credit  card companies usually won   t charge you   or fifty dollars at the most, if  they do charge you something.    But he said,    A cell phone company  32  Finchum  Morrow  will come after you for every cent.     Well, they had already tried in three and a half minutes, the first three  and half minutes afterwards, I think, because when we got the bill just a  few days later   it was that time of the month that we get the bill   the  calls were on there. They had made five calls, but luckily, they were all  local calls. One of them was a call to a house over in northeast  Oklahoma City. Well, my husband, the next week, took the bill down to  the sheriff   s office because he thought that would be a real follow-up.  Well, the sheriff   s office said,    Well, they could have been calling  anybody.    Well, yes they could have been calling anybody, but that  could lead you to a contact   Now, long story short, a couple months after then, I was talking to a  former coworker of mine, George Burnett, who was an Extension 4-H  educator. He was about the third one after I started, that cycled through  the office. He was there about three years and then he quit, went to law  school, and was working in the DA   s office. He said,    Janie, why didn   t  you call me? I could have gone down to the south part of the city and  probably had your purse     (Laughs) Anyway, that didn   t happen, but  that really taught me a lesson. It   s amazing to me, how scary it makes  you feel after the fact because through the years, I had read where a  women had been mugged, or had had her purse taken from her and I  thought,    Well, how stupid. If someone wants your purse, why don   t you  just hand it over?    (Laughs) Of course, I didn   t have the opportunity  because I didn   t turn around, I didn   t know. I thought it was someone  playing a joke on me. It really makes you feel different, and for two or  three years after then, I wouldn   t go anywhere by myself. I just felt  unsafe. I mean, it just does something to you.  So, that   s my memory of   actually, I went to the 4-H Agent   s  Conference. Well, I had to go to the hospital then to see about my hand  because it continued to swell up. They actually had to cut my ring and  take it off. But then we had a good jeweler that put it back together.  (Laughs) But I went to the Agent   s Conference with my hand bandaged.  That was my final story. (Laughs) I guess I didn   t go to the office on     well, I left after we got through with the sheriff that day and I didn   t go  the next day. I think I went in Wednesday for a short time. (Laughs)  Checked who was on the van before you went in, or parked?  No, I think we parked in front that time. My husband went with me and  we parked in front. (Laughs) You know, all those years I had parked  there and nothing had happened. We thought that it was probably a  student just walking across and saw the opportunity, maybe.  33  Finchum  Morrow  Finchum  Morrow  It was a good time to retire then, wasn   t it?  Right, very good time. (Laughs)  I appreciate you sharing your story, it   s been great.  Thank you.  -------  -------
