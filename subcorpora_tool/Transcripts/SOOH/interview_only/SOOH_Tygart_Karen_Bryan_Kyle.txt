 Kyle Bryan, Bill Tygart, Karan Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Today is July 21, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and we are conducting an oral  history project featuring Cooperative Extension women. We   re here  today in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, to talk a little bit about Cleo Stiles  Bryan, who was a home demonstration agent back in the late 1930s,  early 1940s. She had a thirty-seven year career and retired in 1973.  That   s a long, long career. Her first Extension job was in Pauls Valley.  I think so, as far as we knew. That   s where she was when my dad and  she got married.  She taught school down in Marietta, didn   t she?  Yes, she taught school a little while first, before she became an  Extension agent.  Marietta, Oklahoma? Well, today we have Cleo   s step-children, Kyle  Bryan, and Karan Tygart and her husband Bill. So, thank you for having  me today.  Thank you for coming.  Let   s start with having you tell us what you might know about where  Cleo was born and that type of thing, and then we   ll move forward.  She was born close to Snyder, out in the country. She was next to the  baby of eleven children.  And her mother taught her how to cook.  (Laughter) Yes she did, she taught her how to cook.  5  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  And then when she married your father, that would have been 1950s.  Around    50,    51,    52, something around there. I can   t remember.  And both of you would have been in elementary or grade school at that  time?  Or junior high. I might have been in junior high.  Did she get you all involved with 4-H at that time, or had you already  been?  No, we hadn   t been up until then, but we got into 4-H. She set up her  sewing machine and left it there. She   d have her assistant come by and  coach me on it, and I just learned how to sew. (Laughs)  Do you remember what the first thing was?  No, not right now. That   s been too many years ago. (Laughs)  An apron or a scarf?  Probably. Of course, I took so many in school. But that   s where I first  started.  And that would have been here in Tahlequah?  No, that   s at Pauls Valley. They didn   t move to Tahlequah until after I  was married and left home.  Okay, well, that kind of gives us a timeline. You didn   t grow up here in  Tahlequah then.  No.  In Pauls Valley, was there a cloth store where you   d get your fabric?  I   m sure there was, but I don   t remember.  There   s not too many anymore, that   s why I asked. The fabric stores  have gone. When she married your father, she was already an Extension  worker.  Yes.  6  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  So, she was doing a lot of homemaker club work?  Yes. Back in that day and time they had to go and meet all the clubs  every month. She was involved   I don   t know how much   but I know  she was involved with the 4-H clubs, too.  Did you go with her to any of the club meetings?  No.  Were they during the day or at night?  They were at day.  Did she help with the county fair? Do you remember?  Oh, yes. I   m sure she did.  She used to judge at the county fairs.  Some of them.  Judge canning, stuff like that.  So, were you allowed in the kitchen?  Oh, yes. One thing, when I was at home, she   d always put beans on to  soak   red beans, pinto beans. Then, I   d come in and start them when I  got home from school. I never figured out how many to put in there. She  already had it all done. Well, after I married, I fixed a big old two pound  package and we ate beans for a week. (Laughter) That is a family joke.  Yes, she taught me to cook.  What was her favorite thing, do you think, cooking or sewing?  Oh, cooking. She didn   t care to sew. She knew how, but she didn   t care  for it. (Laughs)  Well, she   d have to teach it, I guess.  That   s why she   d have her assistant come over and help me.  Oh, okay.  She did a lot of needle work.  7  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Yes, cross-stitch, and she got to doing that in her later years, too. She did  some quilt tops.  She was the president of the National Association for Extension, too.  Yes, she was.  And that was after she was retired or before? My dates are a little bit  sketchy.  Well, it   d have to be before she retired.  I thought that too, but if she retired in    73, then she was president in    74.  So, maybe that was the last thing she did.  Well, she was president elect and then president, but I can   t remember  what year.  We   ll have to try to look that up. Did you all go to any of the conferences  with her?  No, we weren   t able to do that.  Did your dad?  Yes. They used to go overseas     Yes, she had some friends in Finland. I know they   ve been to Finland.  Finland. She   d been to Moscow, or Russia, I guess.  Probably when she was president then?  I don   t know about that.  Don   t know. They   ve been overseas quite a few times.  It wasn   t work related?  Some of it may not have been. All of it probably wasn   t.  She had these friends and     That she met through the Extension, some of them.  She   d go over there and visit them in different countries.  8  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  I know you traveled around in the county a lot, so she got across the  pond. (Laughter)  Definitely across the pond. (Laughs)  I   m assuming she had her own car when she was doing all of this,  County Extension work?  Oh, yes, her own car.  It wasn   t a company car?  Oh, no.  No, they didn   t furnish them with cars, I don   t think.  Did she know how to change her own tire back in those days?  I don   t know, but probably.  Growing up on the farm, she   s bound to know that. (Laughter)  Did she raise a big garden? Did you all raise a big garden?  No, we lived in town.  In Pauls Valley?  Yes, in Pauls Valley   when she   d have time to.  If she was canning things then she would get those from family she  visited, I guess. You mentioned earlier about commodities. Do you want  to talk a little bit about what you know about that?  Go ahead and tell her.  Well, she used to go out and show the people that got commodities how  to use them, and prepare their food, and even how to take care of their  houses. Sometimes she   d go in there and there   d be chickens in their  house. They   d live out in the country, especially here around Tahlequah,  and she   d have to explain to them about hygiene and, you know.  A lot of poor people that just didn   t know, I guess.  Didn   t know how to use all these things.  9  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  It   d turn your stomach, some of the things she   d say.  Do you want to share a few? Can you remember a couple of those?  One cute thing though, she was sitting at the table there and something  kept biting her on the toe. This little boy was down there biting her on  the toe. (Laughter) She had shoes with the toes out, you know. I  remember that one. I know the commodities   they used to get a lot of  just plain, like Karo syrup. She showed them how to take some maple  flavoring and put in there to make your pancake syrup instead of buying  other syrup, instead of letting that sit there and not use it.  And flour and cheese, I guess, were some of the other things they had.  Yes.  In the early sixties is when the hygiene was an issue in this area, too. I  think water and plumbing and even some places didn   t have electricity  when she was early in her career.  That might be true, back in the hills, here. (Laughs)  We mentioned bedbugs. She probably had to talk about those.  They just had that on the news this morning  (Laughter) Bed bugs are  getting prolific again, all over the country.  When she retired, did her homemaker clubs make her a quilt? Do you  know? Some do and some don   t.  I don   t remember it. Do you?  I don   t remember them making her a quilt, but she made so many quilts  herself   bunches of them.  Do you know how she got started with the cookbooks? Like the very first  one?  Well, not exactly, no.  It was after she retired. The first one was in    76?  Yes, 1976. I don   t know exactly why, because she   s always liked recipes  and all. She just decided to make one.  10  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Do you know how she came up with the name of the book?  From her mother. She   d ask her mother how to do something, and she   d  say,    Well, it seems like I did it this away.    And so, that   s what she  called all her book.  That   s a pretty good book. And so she   s done four, that one and one in  1980. And then    89?  Yes,    89.  And the last one was a little bit different title.  Yes, It seemed like Grandma let us cook this away. It was in 2002. She  had started this one and didn   t get it finished when she passed away. So,  my daughter took what she had compiled and put it together, and had it  printed up for my dad. He sold some, and we still have some left.  Cleo liked to do poetry and her granddaughter did, too?  Yes, she likes to do some.  So, do you want to read that one?  Yes, this is a poem she dedicated to her grandma.  You are sweet.  You are nice.  You made everything seem so right.  I loved your cooking.  It always came from the heart.  Your wisdom and knowledge made me smart.  You always cared and thought of others,  but to me you were a perfect grandmother.  I miss you so much that my heart aches.  Every time I get frustrated and want to cry,  I think of how you always told me to try.  Even though you are gone,  I know you watch over me from dusk    til dawn.  If I could see you one last time,  I would tell you all the dreams of mine.  I love you so much, I wish you were here,  but please remember I will always keep you near.  I love you grandma.  By Magan Nicole Zike, your loving granddaughter.  11  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  That   s good. The beginning of the book kind of gives us a history of her  and her poetry. So, she   s got four cook books. The first one sold out?  Yes ma   am, it   s been sold out for several years now.  Any idea how many copies?  Oh, no, because she had it reprinted.  She had it printed twice.  She had it printed twice. I have no idea how many copies.  I think she had   the first one   I think she had   was it 20,000?  10,000 or 20,000. I can   t remember.  That   s a lot.  And she did craft shows to sell them and get orders down.  So, she sold them mostly in-state?  Oh, no, they sold all over. Like at one craft show in War Eagle  ,  Arkansas  people came there from all over the country, and then people  would hear about it. She   d get calls or letters, and she   d ship them all  over the place.  She had to do that herself?  Yes.  They were just sitting in the garage and she   d go out and get one and  send it away?  Yes.  We still get calls now.  Yes, we   ve still got some cookbooks left. We still ship a few now and  then. (Laughs) The second one has all the recipes in it. The third one has  some reading, all about history, games and lots of little things in the  front of it, and then recipes in the back.  Those recipes are not repeated.  12  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  They   re different recipes.  Through all four.  Yes. Well, one and two may have just a few in there that repeat, but  they   re mostly different.  Do you know how she gathered them? How she would get them?  Some are borrowed from friends that went to church, or some of her  clubs.  Some of the older people. What did they call it?    A pinch of this and a  dash of that.    She   d go out and watch them do it, and they   d kind of  measure with what they called considered back then. That way, she   d get  the recipe for it.  Would she try it before she put it in? Make it herself before it went in?  I think so, yes.  So, they   re tried and true. Do you use any of them?  Oh, yes. (Laughs)  A lot of the recipes, you   ve got the name of the person that she got the  recipe from under the recipe.  Yes.  So, what was your favorite thing she cooked for you?  I don   t know. I just like all food   Chicken fried steak wasn   t bad.  Chicken fried steak.  Yes, that was good.  We   d eat roast and, well, everything was so good.  Favorite dessert?  She made pound cake. I liked the pound cake because I   m not a big  13  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  sweet eater, but it wasn   t real, real sweet   and no icing. (Laughs)  So, she didn   t really retire when she retired.  No. Do women ever? (Laughs)  She loved to entertain people, have people over for dinner or supper and  just, the more the merrier. Especially at Thanksgiving or Christmas.  Families would be     Families and neighbors.  Neighbors and everybody.  Whoever she could get to come.  So, did she give you all lessons on where to place things on the table, or  did that part matter?  Oh, yes. We learned how to set the table.  We learned our etiquette pretty well. (Laughter) I remember Cleo had a  child   s cookbook. It had a place setting in there.  She did. It started out with a little section in the front explaining things  to children of what things were and how to do things.  I figured she may have set you down and said this is how it   s done.  (Laughter)  I   m seventy years old, that   s been way back there. They taught you then.  I remember her talking about jacks. Most kids now don   t know what  jacks are. They don   t know what you   re even talking about. She went  through a description of it, and how many people she talked to, trying to  figure out the procedure of jacks.  You bounce a ball and pick them up, don   t you?  Yes. You don   t know how to play it either  (Laughter) The onesies and  twosies and all that, that   s easy, but it   s all the other stuff that went after  that, that was hard to remember.  I know what they are, but     I remember playing, that   s been     14  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  It   s in this cookbook, too.  That   s in this one.  So, she taught you table etiquette. Did you end up having to clean the  kitchen up afterwards, or did she assign chores?  We were housecleaners.  We helped clean the house and do dishes and all that, yes.  Well, that   s how you learn to keep your house halfway clean now.  Kyle   s learned how to cook, too.  Oh, yes, I can cook.  Because he   s an old bachelor now. He   s got to cook. He   s a good cook.  I can make roast. I made carrots, potatoes, and all that today for her. I  cook every day. (Laughter)  Thanks to her teaching, or do you just enjoy doing it?  I enjoy cooking.  So, you use the cookbooks maybe more than Karan?  Oh, I   ve used them   well, I know about whatever   I eat the same thing  all the time, so I really know how to cook, but for a new recipe I have to  get it out.  Do you remember the parade that the town gave her when she came  back from having gotten some award?  The Cleo Bryan Day.  Yes, it was Cleo Bryan Day.  Do you remember that?  I don   t know if I was here. I don   t think I was here when they had the  parade. I was in the service, I think, at that time.  That was probably in the seventies as well.  15  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  I wasn   t here. I   ve heard about it.  I read somewhere where her grandson was there and he wanted  somebody to have flowers, and went and got one or something.  Well, we must have been. Yes, that was Wayne. We must have been  around then. I remember him telling that. Wayne took up a little flower  up to her.  It must have been about the same time as the parade.  Maybe, I can   t remember.  I don   t remember.  A lot of time has passed.  Yes.  And then she was named Home Economist of Oklahoma by the governor  at one point. And you gave us    The Corsets and Girdles,    is that what  you gave me?  Yes, that was something, The Creeping Underwear, Dreaded Disease.     Yes, I gave you that, so you can put that in there. It   s a long one too, but  it   s funny. The way she   d tell it was hilarious.  And she   d tell it at   ?  When she   d give talks and stuff.  In the county and out of the county.  And out of the county, yes. She told it lots of places, but it was good.  Do you have a favorite memory of Cleo?  Yes, in the later years we   d go on vacations together.  Fishing, she loved to fish.  She liked to fish herself?  Oh, yes.  16  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  B. Tygart  Tygart  Finchum  We   ve been to Canada fishing before. Florida, Colorado.  Would she use live bait?  We   d use both. We   d trotline. Mom, she caught a thirty something-odd  pound striper down here at Webbers Falls.  Yes, she had it stuffed, had it mounted on the wall.  Would she clean them and gut them herself, or was that somebody else   s  job?  No, she doesn   t clean them. She cooks them, but she won   t clean them.  (Laughter) But she   ll take them off the hook and all that.  So used worms?  We used a lot of minnows.  If they   re doing a trotline, you   d go catch shad.  In 1960, we were vacationing in Red River, New Mexico.  Yes, the first time they went out there to catch trout.  Took the Jeep ride up on the high lake. It was easily 12,000 or 13,000  feet. Cleo fell in the lake, actually fell in. These guys over here were  going to take her back down. He was afraid she was going freeze. She  said,    No, I paid for this fishing trip, and I   m going to fish     (Laughter)  She   d go in her car and drive off and go fishing.  She said,    Daddy, Cleo fell in the lake     (Laughter) We were up there  trout fishing.  Did you actually see her fall in?  Yes, but she didn   t go overhead, she just fell inside of the    you know,  slipped and fell in. The water didn   t go over her head, I don   t think, but I  don   t remember. There was a bush there close to the water level. She  was holding on to the end of that bush, going around that bush, and then  that limb broke and then she went in. (Laughter)  I wasn   t up there then. I wasn   t up at that part.  What time of year was this?  17  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  B. Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  K. Tygart  It was in winter.  If she was drying her clothes. I guess it had to be cooler weather.  That   s when we had our first child, our daughter. So, I was at the cabin  with the baby. (Laughs)  She used to go deer hunting. She killed deer before. She had her own  gun. (Laughs)  She was a true pioneer woman. They probably farmed and killed their  own chickens at one time.  I   m sure they did.  Well, if she killed deer, did she make deer jerky?  Kyle makes that, but I do most of the deer jerky.  She just brought it to you?  Yes, I made so much last year that I got burned out on it.  Well, she didn   t like to sew. Did you have to make your clothes or were  they store bought by then.  Store-bought, mostly.  Readymade.  Yes.  That   s a term I   m learning, readymade.  Readymade, yes. After I got married and started having kids, that   s  when I started making a lot of their clothes and all.  So, some of those lessons came back.  Oh, yes. I always sewed some. Now I   m into piecing quilts. I don   t sew  much personal stuff, just piece quilts.  When you were in high school, you were in 4-H?  Yes.  18  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Did you take things to the fair yourself in high school? Did either one of  you?  Yes, I used to collect bugs, insects and take them to the fair, and leaves  and seeds, and enter the exhibits. I   d win ribbons.  So, she rubbed off on you a little bit. Made sure you were busy.  Yes.  County fairs, I guess they still have them, but maybe not to the extent  that they did.  Yes, they still have them. But I haven   t been to one in years. I don   t  know how much they still do.  I read somewhere that she wrote a twenty volume history of the Fifty  Years of the National Association of Extension Home Economists: A  Twenty Volume Set. Does that ring any bells to you?  No.  I only saw it in one spot, but a copy of this is supposed to be in  Washington.  If she did, I didn   t really know anything about it.  I   m thinking maybe twenty pages, maybe not twenty volumes.  I could see maybe something like that, but not twenty volumes.  I don   t know about that.  Well, I   ll double check. If I find out it is, I   ll let you know.  Okay. We don   t have anything on it, if it did. (Laughs)  Well, she   s in Who   s Who? The book, Who   s Who?  I   ll check that too. Maybe it   ll say something on whether or not     I   ve got a copy of that book.  Yes, we   ve got those.  I got that, my name is in it. Well, yours is too, under her name. (Laughs)  19  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  B. Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  I read that when she first started they had the Homemakers Women   s  Club go out to camps, two and three day camps. Do you know anything  about that? It didn   t last too much into her career.  I don   t know anything about that.  We used to go to church camp all the time.  But this is the Women   s Extension Group that they   re talking about. I  don   t remember anything about that, do you?  Well, I went to some of those camps, but I don   t know if that was with  the church camp or if it had anything to do with the 4-H. I don   t really  remember.  The church camp was at Turner Falls, wasn   t it?  I don   t really remember. I don   t know where they had it.  Turner Falls is down next to Pauls Valley, isn   t it?  Yes, it   s down in that area. That could have been.  Here it   s Webber Falls.  Yes.  And she received an award from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in  1974. It   s probably one of the plaques you have that we will look at  later.  She   s got all kinds of awards or plaques.  Do you know the stories behind any of them?  No.  When she would go sell her cookbooks, did she wear anything in  particular?  She had like a white pinafore apron that she wore.  That she always wore?  Like this here.  20  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  B. Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Like this picture on the number two book.  Yes, of course she had an apron.  I don   t have any of them or I   d give it to you.  Was that taken in her house?  Yes, that was in her house.  This is your father?  Yes.  Okay, and then that   s her mother?  Her mother, yes.  Who   s that?  It shows some pictures on the back.  On the back it   s Cleo. It says,    Try my vittles.     I don   t know who it is.  I bet this is supposed to represent, maybe, her mom and dad.  It could be.  Yes, that   s Cleo. (Laughs)  Are any of her siblings still alive? Do you keep up in touch with them?  They   re not.  I think they all passed away.  She was the next to the youngest of eleven.  And Faye, the youngest   Faye was the youngest, wasn   t she?  Yes, I think so.  Cleo died before Faye.  21  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Cleo used to get her cigarettes and take her cigarettes off of her.  I know it, but Cleo died before Faye did, because we didn   t tell Faye.  She couldn   t understand.  Maybe so, because she was in a nursing home.  Yes, she was in a nursing home since    90.  Cleo lived to be in her eighties, didn   t she?  Yes.  Well into her eighties.  Yes.  Odell was born in    15.  She was born in    17. She died in    01. Yes, she was born March 3, in    17,  and died August 5, in 2001. I don   t know how old that makes her.  Eighty-something. Let   s just leave it at that. (Laughs)  I need a calculator  (Laughs)  Was she living in Tahlequah at that time, too?  Yes. Yes, she died at home. She had cancer.  Anything else pop in your head?  No, that   s about all I can think of.  Any household hints that she was good at saying that has stuck with  you?  Not right off hand.  Do you know if she did radio?  She did a TV show, a cooking show on TV, in Tulsa.  In Tulsa for awhile there.  22  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  B. Tygart  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Karen Keith.  That sounds right, and I think she   s still there.  She   s still there, but she   s not in the same department.  Do you know which radio?  Channel Six, wasn   t it?  Six or Eight, whatever one that is out in Tulsa.  I   ve been there to watch all that. She   d put on a little cooking show once  a month. That was pretty interesting.  Bob Howard and Don Wood were on that channel.  At the same time?  That   s when Betty Boyd was probably there.  Yes.  I   ve interviewed Betty, she was a cool lady.  We used to have a bunch of her tapes. My dad used to tape them on  VHS I guess, but I don   t know whatever happened to all those tapes of  her show.  I don   t know either.  If they end up being in your mysterious boxes     They could be. Who knows?  So, this would have been after she retired, or before?  This would have been after, because that   s when she was selling her  cookbooks.  Oh, okay.  So, sometime in the seventies and eighties then.  Yes.  23  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  So, you remember more than you think. (Laughter)  It just has to get talking and thinking. It comes back to you a little bit at  a time.  You   ll just have to keep pumping. (Laughter) She did it for quite a few  months there.  There was one time it was     Quite a few times.  Oh, yes, several times. We went several months there. I can   t remember  how long.  What about newspapers? Did she do articles in newspapers?  Not that I can remember.  Sometimes they were required to, but they weren   t always.  Well, she was in this Oklahoma Living magazine.  She was talking about if she had to do a write up in the newspaper or  something.  Oh, no.  She didn   t do that as far as I know. Yes, there was a write up of her in  Oklahoma Living.  Was that at cookbook time too, or before?  Probably cookbook time.  When she was doing demonstrations, did she have to practice at home or  did she not do much of that?  On her cooking show?  No, back when she was working her job.  I don   t remember her practicing at home, but that doesn   t mean she  didn   t.  Where was her office, do you know? Was it in the courthouse or city  24  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  B. Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  hall?  The Pauls Valley Courthouse.  At the courthouse, wasn   t it? Yes.  In the basement or what floor?  First floor.  First floor, I think.  Usually they   re in the basement. (Laughter)  I don   t think it was the basement.  I don   t remember going down the stairs now, because I   ve been there.  And her office here was in that community building, here in town. It   s  the same space where it is now. Bob Kennedy was there when he called  the man     The county agent.  County agent, yeah.  Is he still   ?  I think he   s still alive.  Here, or in Pauls Valley?  Here.  Tahlequah.  He might have some Cleo stories to tell, too.  Oh, yes. I   m sure he would.  They locked horns several times.  Locked horns?  My dad and Bob Kennedy were in business together at the Dairy Barn,  over here. My dad ran the Dairy Barn ten or twelve years, they had it. It  25  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  B. Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  was just an ice cream and hamburger joint, right by the school.  That   s another reason why you might like cooking.  Yes, but Bob Kennedy would be a good one to talk to.  Was he the county director, or was he to her counterpart?  Her counterpart.  He was a county agent.  So, he was a farm county agent.  He just lives as your going into town, on the left there, right before you  get into town. I guess he   s still there.  They sold that one down on the pig farm.  Well, I don   t know if he lives there or not. (Laughs)  Well, he would be in his seventies or eighties then too, wouldn   t he?  He   d be older than that, because I   m seventy.  He   s in his nineties.  He   d be in his nineties.  Do you know if he retired from Extension, too? So, he was here a long  time then?  He was there a long time. We went to the same church, too. Of course,  it   s been years since I   ve been to church here. So, I   m not sure if he   s  still alive or not.  Don   t really know for sure.  Kyle doesn   t ever get a paper out here. He doesn   t keep up with  anything. (Laughter)  If it   s not on TV, I don   t have it. I don   t get it. (Laughter)  Not much in them anyway. You read the obituaries?  I read the obituaries and Dear Abby. (Laughs)  26  B. Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  B. Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  You can get information off the TV long before the paper ever gets here.  Is there an obituary for Cleo in here, or do you have one?  It   s not in there, but I bet I could come up with that. I didn   t think about  that.  Well, if you don   t have one, if we have a date, I can get with the paper  and get a copy that way, too. It would tell us a little bit about     I   ve got one of my dad   s back here, but I don   t have one     I found a copy of his online.  With his picture and everything?  I think it had a picture on it.  Because I   m pretty sure I kept some of that stuff that the funeral home  left us.  It might tell us, I guess, what her degrees were in and from where.  It might, yes. I can   t remember whether they went that detailed or not.  She had more initials behind her name than she took to spell her name.  Well, was Cleo short for something, or was it just Cleo?  No, it was just Cleo.  Cleo wasn   t Cleopatra or anything like that, just plain old Cleo? And he  went by Odell?  Yes.  Cleo   s middle name  was Mildred .  I just figured Cleo was short for something.  No, it   s not.  Just Cleo.  Yes, I might be able to come up with that obituary for you. I never  27  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  B. Tygart  Finchum  B. Tygart  Finchum  B. Tygart  Tygart  B. Tygart  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Bryan  Finchum  thought about that.  Did she talk about her family background any at all that you remember?  We were thinking that she was from Mississippi before they came here.  That may have been her mother or something that came from  Mississippi originally. I have no idea about that.  But she did have kinfolks in Mississippi. Wait, you   ve visited.  Yes, I   ve been to visit some of them. She had kinfolks in  Mississippi. Yes, they just lived on a farm. They talked about having a  milk and     One room school house.  And her parents or her grandparents were in the Land Run, you said?  Her dad was in the Land Run. He made the Run, staked his claim, and  went to file on it. You had to be twenty-one and he was twenty. The  bank wound up loaning to his cousin. He gave it to them.  He ended up getting it, though, after he turned twenty-one?  No.  It   s in this book somewhere about it.  It   s close to the front.  That   s what I was thinking.  And then she had to learn to make do with what you had early on.  There are all the colleges.  Started in 1939, then. I was thinking it was    41.  Where   d she go to college at?  Central State. The University of Central Oklahoma   UCO in Edmond.  And then her master   s was from Oklahoma A M, OSU, in Rural Adult  Education. They haven   t had that program in quite a while. She was the  first Home Demonstration Agent in the nation to meet with the Federal  Extension Committee on Organization and Policy, whatever that is.  28  Tygart  Finchum  B. Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  B. Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Yes. (Laughter)  Maybe she had to go to D.C. and talk with the     She made several trips to Washington.  She had a good, full life, didn   t she?  Oh, yes.  And liked to fish and hunt.  Yes   Fishing was a lot better   a lot more than hunting.  In the very back of number three, I think, she makes a little comment  about fishing right when she was going fishing.  It says she writes a weekly news column for the local hometown paper.  See, I didn   t know that.  I think she did for a while, but not     And gives speeches.  Oh, yeah. She could give speeches.  They used to pay her to go, I don   t know where, but paid her so much     not a lot   to give a speech.  That helped her cover expenses, you know.  Cover travel expenses.  Yes.  She keeps more than 10,000 letters from satisfied readers? That may be  in your boxes, too.  Oh, no, I   m sure they got rid of them. They threw a lot of papers away.  You wouldn   t believe all the stuff that woman kept. (Laughs)  Out in the garage it looked like a hoarder. Well, just boxes. It was pretty  well organized, but just boxes after boxes of her paperwork.  29  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Bryan  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  B. Tygart  Tygart  Finchum  It wasn   t in any specific order though, where you could find what you  wanted.  That   s that generation, too. You don   t throw it away. You know, you  might need it later.  Yes, I   m trying to get out of that. (Laughs)  Well, it was probably one of those skills she had to teach, was  organization. So, you think it   d be somewhat organized. Makes kids  furniture.  Yeah, my dad did, they did this. He had to find something to go to the  craft shows with her. (Laughs)  He went with her instead of her going with him.  Either way   She sold the cookbooks, he sold the furniture. (Laughter)  She wrote this one when she was seventy-two. So, she really didn   t  retire.  No.  No.  But with Extension, she   d have to get up and be gone by probably eight  o   clock and get home late.  Oh, yes.  So, you didn   t go into home economics, I take it?  Oh, no.  Or farming.  Raising family.  Got married then stayed home and took care of the kids.  Well, you had a good teacher on how best to do that.  30  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Finchum  Tygart  Yes.  How do you think she would want to be remembered?  As a good cook and a good person, loving mother.  She   d want you to come on in, sit down, and eat with her?  Oh, definitely.    Come by and see us. We   ll feed you.    (Laughter)     Creeping Underwear, Dreaded Disease,    by Erma Bombeck, often told  at meetings by Cleo Bryan.     We had virtually erased bad breath in this country. Stamped out  dandruff and done away with burning, itchy feet. But we had been  unable to conquer one of society   s most dreaded diseases: creeping  underwear. Everyone talks about creeping underwear, but no one does  anything about it. Technical research has put powdered orange juice on  the moon, yet on earth we are still plagued with pantyhose that won   t  stay up, slips that won   t stay down, and girdles that should contain a  label,    hazardous to your health.    To suggest that creeping underwear  changes a person   s personality is the understatement of this decade.  The other night I went to a movie, a fully confident, well-adjusted, stable  human being. Two hours later, I was a totally different person. My slip  had crept to my waist line to form a solid inner tube, which added about  fifteen pounds to my form. My girdle, in a series of slow maneuvers, had  reached several plateaus during the evening. First, it slid to my waist.  Upon finding this area, it was already occupied by a slip. It moved  upward, cutting my chest in half, and gradually moved upward to where  it pinched my neck and caused my head to grow two inches taller. The  pantyhose were quite another story. They kept sliding down until I  realized halfway through the movie, I was sitting on the label in the  waistband, and that if I dared stand up the crotch would bind my ankles  together.  I tried to adjust these garments in a way so as not to call attention, but  every time I bent my elbow, two straps slid onto my shoulder and bound  my arms like a straight jacket. My husband was the first to notice the  change in my personality.    What are you doing sitting under the seat in a  fetal position?    he asked.    Are you trying to tell me you don   t like the  movie?       I am suffering from creeping underwear.    I whispered.    You  should have taken a couple of aspirin before you left the house,    he  snarled.    Now, get up here and sit up straight in your seat.    He didn   t  understand. They rarely do. Nearly 98.2  of all the victims of creeping  underwear are women. As I sat there, I looked down to the seat next to  31  Finchum  me. I saw another woman in a fetal position.    What are you doing down  here?    I asked.    I crossed my leg and I was flogged to death by a loose  supporter,    she sighed.    Do you think they   ll ever find a cure?    I asked  hopelessly.    I hope so,    she said.    My tongue is beginning to swell.        That   s it.   Thank you.   -------  -------
