 Wilson  Stallings  Today is April 5, 2011 and we are in the Oklahoma State University  Library in Stillwater, Oklahoma. As part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma  Oral History Series of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program, I  will be interviewing Hiroko Fujita, Stillwater   s storyteller  extraordinaire, who is visiting us from her hometown of Kashiwa City,  Chiba, Japan. Welcome.  Thank you.  Here with us also is renowned storyteller Fran Stallings, here from  Bartlesville. My name is Latasha Wilson. Thank you both for being here  and taking this time to visit with me today. It   s wonderful to have you. I  would like to start out learning a little bit more about your background.  Could you tell us where you were born and some about your childhood?  Yes, I was born in 1937. Now I am seventy-three years old. I was born  in Tokyo, but at that time we were at war. My family moved to  Fukushima, Miharu town. There I heard many folk tales from a farmer  there.  Was this farmer a neighbor or a family friend?  No   it   s too hard to tell, so Fran, maybe.  If that   s okay?  Yes, that   s fine.  Because she explained to me.  5  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Yes.  Her father moved them to the town of Miharu, although they had no  connections there but he liked the sound of the name. The name means     three springtimes.     Oh, that   s lovely.  They found the estate of a rich family that had built a small house   like  a mother-in-law house   but it was empty at that time. That small  house   one room, two rooms?  Small, three rooms.  Three very small rooms   was arranged for her mother, grandmother  (her father   s mother), three brothers, and an aunt also.  Yes, aunt and her husband and child, uncle husband and wife and child,  and my baby sister.  Her baby sister came after a while. Father stayed in Tokyo at the  family   s house trying to keep his business running. The owner of the  land, of the estate, all the menfolk were away in the war and so they  rented the farmland around the estate to a middle-aged farmer who came  to work the land. Fujita-san was about second grade age when they came  there, so she escaped the crowded house by going out to talk with this  farmer whenever he sat down to have a cigarette or lunch or something.  He was delighted to have this child who was very interested in hearing  his stories. He had eleven children at home but when he got home he  was usually very tired, so they didn   t hear many of his stories. But, she  got the gift of several hundred stories that he told her in a very  traditional folk style. He must have been in his fifties at that time, and he  learned the stories when he was a child. So the stories went back a  hundred years, at least.  Wow. How would you remember all of these stories?  Four hundred.  Four hundred. How?  I listened when the farmer took a rest  from his work . I went to him and  said,    Please tell story.     Did he tell the same story many times?  6  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Often same story. About a hundred stories I heard only one time.  And you just remembered?  Yes.  Did you go home and share the stories with your brothers and sisters?  No, my baby sister        was born while they lived there so she was very young.  Very young, but sometimes I told her.  For practice.  Practice, yes. (Laughs)  The brothers were much older, perhaps.  Yes, brothers did not hear stories from him, from the farmer.  And you said you also heard a few stories from classmates at school,  laughing stories.  Yes, when I was a child many grandpas or grandmas told stories to  grandchildren. My classmates know stories and we share stories with  each other. Sometimes I heard from the farmer with my friends, but  mostly  I was the only one there .  What did your parents do for a living?  What job?  My father, I don   t know. I can   t say.  He was a business man running coal mines. So back in Tokyo, they had  been well to do. During the war, the neighborhood around them burned.  The father stayed at the big house in Tokyo but he invited homeless  families to come stay in the house. One family, extended family, in each  room of different neighbors. After the war was over, they couldn   t go  home because there were neighbors living in the house, so she stayed in  Miharu until about eighth grade. As families found homes, first eldest  brother came back to Tokyo to go to a Tokyo high school, then the next  brother, then the next brother, and finally when she was ready for middle  school, she came back to Tokyo and got very good English training in a  7  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  middle school in Tokyo. I think that kind of training would not be found  in Miharu, perhaps. Your English learning was in Tokyo?  No, Miharu.  Oh, really? There was a good English teacher there?  We had a good teacher in Miharu, yes. But that is fifty years old. Old,  old soul. (Laughter)  I think it   s a tribute to the training she had then that the English came  back to her.  Definitely. How far was Miharu from Tokyo?  Now we can go Miharu by Shinkansen  which  is a very fast train, about  two hours. But at that time, the train needed eight hours.  So did you see your father while you were living in Miharu?  Father came to Miharu once a month or once  every  two months. When  he came to Miharu, he liked to shoot, go hunting. So hunting and pick  grass to eat.  Gathering?  Gathering, gathering wild herbs.  Herbs, yes.  In the mountains there are many fruits and mushrooms.  Yes, so he went to the mountain with me and he told  of  this flower  named Otageyiso. Why this flower named such a name?  Stories, origin stories for the names.  Tree   s name or flower   s name. He told me many, many stories and a few  stories were from my father. Can you understand?  Yes, very much. Did your family raise a garden in Miharu?  We had no land so a small garden. My mother cultivated and made  potatoes or pumpkin or something to eat.  Would she cook for everyone living in the home?  8  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Yes.  And the house had a well outside. I have seen where the well was. There  also was a cave dug in the mountain behind the house for an air raid  shelter, because on the other side of the mountain was a city where there  were munitions factories, so it was a target and they were afraid of  bombing. Did Miharu ever get bombed?  No.  But sometimes they stayed in the shelter for long periods, saw the  planes     Airplane over the Miharu sky. We must go to cave.  Was there much fear, normally, during these times?  Afraid?  Yes, yes. Sirens    imitates sirens  when the sirens go off, we must go to  cave. The cave, daytime is good, very dark, but I can read and I can play  card game. Evening or nighttime  I was not able to  write.  Okay, blackout also.  We  played  games, board games, kobuta.  It is a song with four animal  names: the last syllable is the same as the first syllable of the next  animal.  Then my brother said,    Tanuki  raccoon dog , and then Kitsune   fox , and Neko  cat .    That   s a game I could do otedema  juggling , no  write.  Practice juggling in the dark.  Oh, wow.  She   s a very good juggler, still.  Would you bring food to the cave?  Usually mother kept some dry food.  In the cave.  In the cave.  9  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  And water?  Water, yes.  How long would you stay in the cave sometimes?  About three or four hours. Airplanes go away so again,  imitates alarm ,  I would go out.  The all-clear signal.  Yes.  Did you have many family members that were in the war?  Did any of your relatives fight in the war?  Yes, my other uncle and cousin. I can   t say   there are people, many go  to war. But only one died, I don   t know. Many of my cousins and my  uncle came back safe.  And your brothers were too young.  Yes.  And your father was too old.  No, father is eldest brother of his family, and the eldest brother must  take care of their family.  Oh, really?  All his family   brother   s family, sister   s family     So the eldest had to stay and look after things.  Yes.  I see.  So this uncle     All the others went away.  And at last my father  went  to war, became a soldier, but he stayed in  Japan. So he   s safe. My eldest brother and second brother went to a  10  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  factory to make war things, parachutes and bombs. They  were  students  but they  went  to a factory and made something.  Yes, in the last years of the war.  Maybe you can tell again, my English is not good.  Oh no, I think     That was very clear.  Very clear, yes.  So how old were you when you started school? Were you in Tokyo still?  Ah, when I started to school, on the first day I go to Tokyo School, but I  couldn   t go to school anymore  because  I moved  to  another place.  She went to the first day   s opening all dressed up. Mother and perhaps  Grandmother came, too. But then the next day, they moved to another  part of Tokyo that was safer. The rest of first grade time she didn   t go to  school, but by second grade time you were living in Miharu?  Yes. Rest of first grade, we moved to Miharu and I go to school from  second grade  until  eighth grade.  From second grade to about eighth grade in Miharu.  What were some chores you had in Miharu, some jobs you did around  the house?  Children   s jobs.  Yes, many jobs. After I woke up and wear clothes  got dressed ,  I went   to the mountains and cut grass for rabbits or roosters or hens. Then we  cleaned the room and outside. Then carried the water to     From the well.  From the well to kitchen. Then table, breakfast. My job is   my brother,  elder brother   how do you say it?  He cut wood for the fire.  Fire, yes, and no rice, only  little  rice. So we get potato, pumpkin, and  that is breakfast.  11  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  And very, very little meat, so she never developed a taste for meat. The  smell of cooking meat is not welcome. (Laughter) But she liked the  vegetables. Some of the children didn   t like the vegetables, so they had  very little to eat. But she liked the vegetables.  So I grew this big. (Gestures) (Laughter)  She grew taller than many other women her age.  That time,  the children were  small. Many  were , but I  was tall .  Why?  Vegetables and also after the war, skim milk.  Yes, after the war, American government gave skim milk to Japanese  children. Many Japanese children do not like skim milk, but I like. I like  very much.  At school or at home?  School, and friends  would say ,    No, thank you.     I would say,     Oh,  yes.       No, thank you.       Oh, Yes.    (Laughs)  So she grew tall, and it was often difficult to find sleeves long enough  for her.  Yes. American people gave us rala. I don   t know why. Rala is a very  big box of clothes.  Oh, yes.  And that rala in the school  was a  very big box. About ten or fifteen  boxes open so my friend tried to wear,    Too long.    I wear,    Oh good   Please give me.    Half of my clothes are rala, from America.  So donated?  I guess so, yes.  Mostly friends wear kimono at that time, but I wear western style.  (Laughter)  Because they fit you, yes.  Did your mother sew much? Did she make your clothes?  12  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Yes, but there was no cloth at that time. I had three big brothers. So   with my  brothers    old clothes, my mother took pink thread and made  flowers. (Laughter)  Also, you were a tomboy. You climbed trees.  Yes. (Laughs)  Pink flowers. (Laughs)  Pink flowers, two or three pink flowers     Pink flowers on boys    clothes.   And now,  this is girl   s clothes. (Laughter)  And your brothers made many toys for you.  Yes.  Out of bamboo and cardboard and rubber bands and stones.  We have no toy store, so my brothers made for me many toys. Other  students, no. My friends, or my brother   s friends, made toys from  bamboo or something. I made my toy doll or juggling ball. I can   t sew  but  I like to  skate, or ski,  but those are  boy   s toys. But I want to ski  or skate, so my second brother is good at making  these things for me .  He made many toys for me. He made sandals for me.  What are some things you learned in the school? Did you enjoy school?  Yes, I liked school. I liked school because  I had  many friends,  and  did  not study. (Laughter) There are many friends. They gave lunch.  So did you participate in sports?  No, I   please tell. My heart. My heart is not good.  She had Rheumatic Fever. So vigorous sports were not part of her  program. But, quiet sports, walking.  Yes.  You could walk and climb trees, I remember.  13  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Yes. (Laughter)  You told me about climbing trees.  It   s not sport. (Laughs)  Well, exercise.  Exercise.  Can I tell about the cherry trees?  Yes.  On the mountain behind the house were the ruins of an old fortress. It  had been made into a city park with many beautiful cherry trees planted  there. A neighbor boy took her and at least one brother up there and said,     You choose your tree. And you climb up in the tree. At home it   s very  crowded, and you have to share the space. But your tree can be a car, a  truck, a ship, an airplane. You can have whatever you want when you   re  in your tree. You can even have your own room.    So she had a tree, one  special tree.  Yes, a cherry tree is very good for girl climbing because  of the  low  branches     The branches are low. You don   t have to go too high before you reach  the branches.  Yes, so many branches. This branch is my room, this branch is the  kitchen, and this branch toilet, this branch dining     Dining room. Guestroom.  So my friends came. Please, please, guestroom. Guest-branch, please.  We talk and then he or she go back. I sleep on branch and watch crowd  and  use my  imagination. Very nice time.  I don   t remember what year   maybe, 1997 or    99? You took me to visit  Miharu.  Yes.  And we went to that park and her tree was still standing, but the kitchen  fell off. (Laughter) She climbed up in her tree.  14  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Oh my goodness. (Laughs)  Maybe, I was sixty-six     Maybe sixty-five or something.  Sixty-five, yes. (Laughter)  I was very worried. (Laughter)  So your imagination really helped you through that time living in such  cramped quarters.  Yes, that was a very good time for me. No television, no radio, no  cloudy things.  And Kuni-san stories.  From Mr. Takeda Kuni, the farmer who told  stories.   Kuni-san stories, yes.  So then you moved back to Tokyo after eighth grade?  Yes.  Or in eighth grade?  End of eighth grade. I and my mother and grandma and baby sister came  back to Tokyo and then go to high school, university. Soon, I married  and came back Fukushima City.  How old were you when you graduated high school?  Twenty-three.  High school?  Oh, high school   high school, nineteen.  Nineteen.  Usually, high school is three     Three years.  Yes, but I need four years because I was not healthy.  15  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Rheumatic heart.  And where did you attend university? What university did you go to?  Japanese Women   s University.  What did you study, at that time?  Children   s Education.  Early Childhood Education.  What made you want to study Early Childhood Education? Why?  At that time, women did not do high education. So my father said,    If  you study,  study  Home Economics.    So I go to Childhood Education.  Even so, from her girl   s high school, she was the only one who finished  university.  Half our high school finished, and half went to two years     So, half graduated high school and went to two year colleges. But she  got a four year degree.  Did you know when you were young that you wanted to go to university?  Was education important?  I noticed that when I was in high school I thought I needed high  education. My boyfriend said,    It need.    (Laughs)  Was the university expensive? Did your family have to pay?  No, my family cannot pay because three big brothers  went  to  university. So one of my uncles, my mother   s big brother, paid my  education money because my mother   s big brother   s wife is a geisha.  They have no children, so my aunt loved me so much. So she paid my  university money. Please tell about my uncle.  He fell in love with a geisha and he had to, not exactly buy her, but pay  her way out of the geisha profession. For one reason or another, they  were unable to have any children. But she was a very beautiful and  skillful and loving person, and was like a second mother for Fujita-san.  Yes, yes.  16  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  What was her name?  Koto.  Koto?  Koto,  like the musical instrument.   Like the musical instrument. Did she play?  Yes, and she played Shamisen  traditional Japanese string instrument ,  and she could dance, Japanese dance. So she had many fans, dancing  fans. Once I wrote dancing fans.  That was from your aunt?  Yes.  The folding fans are made as a kind of souvenir of various performers.  So these were dancing fans of her aunt.  Was it after university that you met your husband?  Yes, before university we     She knew him. He was your big brother   s friend.  Yes.  He would come to their house to do homework because they had one  light bulb. They had strung a wire from the big house to their little  house, and they had one light bulb. So they had light for studying.  Brothers and friends came to do homework.  Before I graduated university, we married.  Ah  Before graduation. (Laughter) You ran off.  What was his profession, his job?  His job. He is a     Engineer.  Engineer.  17  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  I think chemical engineer.  Yes, chemical engineer. Weaving   making thread factory. This is a  factory and this is how to make good thread.  Research.  Research.  Fiberglass, I think.  Fiberglass, yes. He the boss of this research, the boss.  Retired.  Yes.  When did you start teaching kindergarten?  Twenty-four.  Twenty-four years old?  Yes, I have Naoko, first baby. After first baby, I work in nursery room  with her.  Ah, yes. Even at that time, that would be 1960?  1961.  It was fairly unusual for mothers to work, but she could take her baby to  work.  Yes, and then I met Endo-san. It   s important, I think.  Yes, yes.  After marrying, my husband worked at Fukushima City, not Miharu.  After marriage, I worked in nursery school and kindergarten. I like to  read children   s books. I have about 2,000 or 3,000 picture books.  Neighbor children   it   s called Bunko   and neighbor children came. At  that time I met Endo-san.  I will explain. Until recently, Japanese public libraries, most of them had  very little service for children, only for students and adults. So in the  18  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita     60s when there began to be published many wonderful picture books,  the libraries did not carry the picture books. Bunko is the name of a  private library established by, usually, a neighborhood mother, who kept  part of a room in the house for books. Maybe once a week, children  would come and hear a program, and take books home and exchange  books from last week. The mothers often had no training to be like a  children   s librarian, but Fujita-san had early childhood training and so  she had the Bunko, often buying picture books instead of stockings or  something, for herself. There were meetings of Bunko mommas to talk  about good picture books.  Yes.  But Endo-san, an older woman, came one time to such a meeting.  Endo-san knows about 800 stories, folktale. I heard from Endo-san the  stories. About 400 stories I heard from her. When I was a child I heard  about 400 stories from the farmer, named Kuni-san. Kuni-san told me  about 400 stories. Then, Endo-san told me 400, mostly the same stories.  Endo-san was from Fukushima Prefecture.  Yes, and what do you say? Oh, mostly same. This part, only a different  story I heard when I was adult from Endo-san. Please, tell.  I remember you said when Endo-san came to the Bunko mama meeting,  she said,    Oh, these are foreign stories. They are not so good. I know  real Japanese stories.    Then Fujita-san heard Endo-san   s stories and  recognized stories she heard in childhood. These stories began to come  back from her memory from all these stories she heard from Kuni-san.  That   s when she realized that telling stories in the folk manner was  important for children, for not just reading picture books. Many foreign  picture books were adapted into Japanese, and were excellent picture  books, but children should also hear stories. So she began to work on  that.  Yes, so, I told the stories to nursery school, or kindergarten, or school     my children go to, elementary school that my children go to.  So you told stories at your children   s elementary school?  Yes, sometimes. I tell story, mostly     Bunko.  Bunko and kindergarten, nursery school. But sometimes  I went to the   19  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  nursery school that my children  went to . But at that time, school  teacher said,    No, thank you.    But I,    No  Please tell  Must tell      (Laughter) At that time, very difficult. Only mama go to school and do  something.  Volunteer.  Volunteer, it   s very difficult, but I did.  You embody the concept that there is more to storytelling than just  words.  That was my angle when I first met Fujita-san and heard her storytelling,  I knew only a little Japanese. So the words that she was saying did not  tell the stories to me. It was her actions and voice that helped me follow  the story, and I had been publishing some articles trying to analyze what  was effective about oral storytelling. It seemed to me that she was the  perfect example that there is more than words. Because if only words  told the story   like you would find on paper   then we would not be  able to understand her stories. So I was very excited when I met her and  I said,    Please, please, come to America     (Laughter)  So from the beginning, have you used hand puppets and various props?  Did you start out using these things when you told stories?  No, I was a kindergarten teacher, so I used many puppets before telling a  story.  Before you started storytelling, you were already doing puppets and  things with preschoolers.  Yes, not for telling. If I say,    Wash your hands, children,     they  do not  do it. But if I puppet,    Can you wash your hand?    the children go.  (Laughter) So I use in such times, not for stories.  So she was already a skillful puppeteer out of necessity. (Laughter)  Yes.  Because also, puppets and other props that help children understand  when she told old time stories, some animals were not familiar to city  children, customs were not familiar, so she had visual props   visual  aids   to explain the stories to the children. Well, it also helped people  who spoke no Japanese.  Yes.  20  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  But also, her gestures and face and voice were communicating more  than just the words. So we could understand.  Do you have a mental process you go through to put on a character in a  story? You become the character, do you just do this naturally, or do  you prepare in your mind?  No prepare, no prepare. (Laughs)  Not an actor, just spontaneous. But Kuni-san was very, very lively in  telling his stories.  Yes, yes.  So she learned naturally. You said one time someone in the story was  holding kasa, an umbrella.  Yes.  So he picked a Taro leaf, a Taro plant that has a big leaf, and he picked  the leaf and danced with the leaf.  Yes.  So she had good training from a natural storyteller.  Mostly storytellers in Japan now tell stories from books. Please     I   ve worked in Japan with her many times, and she is a folk teller, but  many people who call themselves storytellers now are what Americans  would call revivalist tellers. They did not learn stories in childhood.  They didn   t grow up with storytelling. They   re just telling stories out of  books. Many of them seem to have learned librarian style of the 1950s,  which was just talking the story. Librarians wanted the children to go  read the book, so they didn   t want to tell the story in a way that was  different from the book. So no gestures, no lively face or voice, just  talking-head style. We still see that in Japan. American librarians have  changed, but that school of storytelling got started in Japan, and we try  to shake things up. (Laughter)  My geisha aunt knows many games. When I was a child, we would play  something. These are warabe-uta  nursery songs .  Nursery rhymes, nursery songs. Like schoolyard games.  21  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  But I found my uncle played the weasel man. Children play, but the  word is very difficult to understand. What it means, I don   t know.  Like the English nursery rhymes, these have been passed down orally  from a long time ago, and children easily learn the words even if it  doesn   t make much sense. The rhythm is nice, but if an adult tries to  think about it, they realize that they don   t know what that was talking  about.  Yes.  You can read  Iona and Peter  Opie   s studies about English nursery  rhymes. Ring Around the Rosie is about the plague.    All fall down    is  about dying in the plague,    ashes, ashes.    Well, perhaps some of these  Japanese nursery rhymes also came from that old tradition.  Yes, and maybe the English nursery rhymes are not so under this, but  Japanese     Japanese notion of what   s inappropriate with children is not as strict as  ours. So maybe many of these nursery rhymes were really pretty earthy.  (Laughter) I have seen, in Japan, Fujita-san telling a story to children  and adults and all ages together. And it might have some earthy elements  in it, and they all comfortably laugh together. In America, I can tell that  story to adults and they like it, or I can tell it to kids and they think it   s  great. But if kids and adults are together, whoa  (Laughter)  Kids cannot understand, only adults understand.  So maybe adults could understand the double entendre.  Yes, yes.  And children just think its interesting words.  Yes. My geisha oba-san  aunt , told me     Did she also teach you this difficult     Yes, difficult.  Like we have Itsy, Bitsy Spider, and other hand games that little children  play? Well, apparently geisha had some hand games that they would  play with the clients and depending on how much Sake you had had, it  could be very, very difficult to do some of them, just because of the  coordination that it takes. It took me about two weeks. No, no, only on  22  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  one side, and then the other side.  Left, right, yes, yes  (Laughs)  There are many, many like that. Some children can do them.  I have a few more questions about storytelling in general, and then I   ll  get into how your relationship began, how you started coming to  Oklahoma. First of all, how do you remember all of these stories? There  are so many stories   I heard these stories when I was a child. If I heard as an adult, I cannot  remember. But when I was a  child , my brain empty so many stories.  (Laughter) No television, no radio, no other interesting things. Perhaps,  my brain wanted to keep stories, I think. When I became an adult, I  heard many new stories, but all are gone. So it is important I was a child,  I think. Okay?  I read that you speak in your native dialect, from the Fukushima  Prefecture.  Fukushima-ben.  Is this understood throughout Japan?  No, if I told the story truly in Fukushima   ben, maybe  people from   other prefectures cannot understand it. Only Fukushima people. Now,  children cannot understand if I tell deep Fukushima-ben. So I change  mostly standard and a little Fukushima   ben. Understand? (Laughs)  Yes.  So some persons maybe can understand. (Laughs)  When Fujita tells stories to Americans, she can relax and use deep  Fukushima-ben. Unless there are some Japanese people or some  American children who are learning Japanese, and then she tells in  standard for them.  Yes.  So you taught kindergarten for forty years?  No, fifty years.  Fifty years. Are you still teaching?  23  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Yes.  Really?  Only once a week I go to kindergarten and tell story. Mostly, my job is  young mommas   what? Advise?  Yes, advising. Sometimes the government has paid her to help young  mothers learn how to play with their children because the population in  Japan is declining. Families are very small, many young adults had no  siblings, or only one or two, close in age. So they don   t know how to  play with a baby. They never did babysitting because at the high school  age for babysitting, they had to go to Juku after school (training to get  into a good university). So young mothers don   t know what to do with a  baby, and Fujita-san knows. So sometimes the government hires her to  do workshops for mothers. How many books did you write?  About thirty.  Total, but how many for mothers?  Oh, for mothers, six or eight. Yes, eight books.  Little books of advice for zero to three months, three months to six  months, all along, how to do a good job raising a baby. Don   t just put  the baby in front of the television. (Laughter)  I was going to ask, you   ve mentioned some of your mentors, the farmer  for one, and Endo-san. Did you have any other mentors?  Teachers, inspiration?  No. (Laughs)  You said you liked your middle school English teacher.  Yes, yes, English. She   s very good teacher, but not a story.  No, not in storytelling.  Okay. So that English teacher is very good. And one more person, my  aunt, my geisha aunt.  Yes.  24  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Geisha is usually very low class.  A poor girl?  Yes, poor, and my mother doesn   t like her because her job is not good.  My mother said   please wait.  Digital dictionary.  That   s wonderful.  Contempt.  Contempt, yes. That job was held in contempt.  Yes, usually many persons contempt her. She   s very good, but doesn   t  like mother, I think. (Laughter)  Now, you have served as a mentor to other women who are becoming  storytellers?  Young Yamanbas.  Young Yamanbas, yes. But I do not educate them. They heard my  telling, and they want to tell themselves. I am sorry, not teach. They  heard my storytelling and    Oh, wonderful.    Sometimes they tell similar  to me, or they tell their own way.  Yes, yes.  But you encourage them?  Encourage?  You say,    Please try.     Yes, please try, yes. Must teach.  Perhaps, not like a formal class, like with graduation or anything, but  they are followers of her and supporters. The first publishing of your  books, it was their idea.  Yes, yes.  To publish the first seven books. One woman is a very skillful  photographer and videographer, and she records some of Fujita-san   s  25  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  work. Another is becoming a professional illustrator and has illustrated  many of her books, and our books also. One woman   s husband was a  publisher.  Yes, yes. Printer.  Printer, yes. Katare Yamanba     Speak, Mountain woman      books. And  they would work with her where she was living, but then they often  moved to other parts of Japan and then said,    Please, come and do a  workshop here.    So Fujita-san in Japan is very busy, traveling.  Traveling, teaching, and encouraging. How many young Yamanbas?  Now, thirty. Thirty ladies.  But some graduate or go away. Maybe total     Total, forty or over forty.  All around Japan. And now some of them are telling my stories, too.  You have written over thirty books?  Yes, thirty.  Thirty, yes. And newspaper columns. (Laughter)  And some magazines.  Magazine articles, yes.  Now I have three magazines every month.  Wow, every month you have to write something for them?  Three magazines. This magazine for kindergarten. This magazine for  storyteller. This magazine is also for children, before I come back to  America, I write, write, write. (Laughter)  And sometimes when she was traveling with me in America, I remember  you sitting in bed in the motel room with your computer and busy  writing. (Laughter)  How many children do you have?  Three, and elder daughter have no children. Son has two. My second  daughter has two. So four grandchildren.  26  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Wow, you are busy  (Laughs)  Yes  (Laughter) I enjoy.  Good.  I enjoy to travel.  Have you been involved with any organizations in Japan for  storytelling?  Sakurai-san no kai  group . Mukashi banashi no kai  oldtime tales  group . Folktale association.  Nihon Minwa, yes. It   s a folktale association. Scholars and people who  collect folktales.  I belong.  But then, Sakurai-san   s group was     No Katarite.  Not involved with revivalist tellers.   Katarite.  I don   t believe that.  Yes, that was more of a group of the revivalist tellers, and she was not  involved with them.  Also, I belong  to a  childhood education group. But I must tell how I  visit Stillwater.  Yes. (Laughter) So how did you come to meet Fran?  Fran-san, please tell.  Is that okay?  Yes, that   s fine.  My youngest brother Carl was a professor at Reitaku University in  Kashiwa.  My town  now .  27  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  And he invited my family to come visit in 1993. So my husband and I,  and our high school son, went to Japan and met with Carl. I said,    I   m  working as a storyteller. I would like to see Japanese storytelling.    My  brother   s colleague   s wife had a bunko, a small private library, and she  knew Fujita-san. Fujita-san had come to the bunko sometimes to tell  stories. So we arranged to go and watch Fujita-san tell stories. I was so  amazed because I could understand. I thought,    Oh, this is wonderful      (Laughter) We have to. She invited me to come to a place where she was  telling stories and suddenly, I was telling stories there. So we thought  maybe we could work together.  That was    93. It was 1995 before I was able to convince enough schools  and libraries that someone could tell stories without a word of English  and it would still be worthwhile. Americans had a hard time  understanding that it could work. But we developed a technique. It  doesn   t work with every story that she knows, but if I can give an  introduction in English   the beginning of the story and some outline of  what to expect   then she can tell the story. Some stories with puppets or  visuals, but other stories just face and hands. American people say,    I  didn   t understand any words, but I understood the story.    That method  worked well in America. She came in    95,    96,    97, almost every year  until recently. Then in    97, she invited me to come to Japan, and the  other way around, she introduced my stories in Japanese and I told in  English. Japanese people said,    I don   t understand English, but I  understood the stories,    so it worked.  Wow, and it   s really bridged a cultural divide.  Yes, language gap, yes. In fact, International Story Bridge is the name of  an award that we were given in 2003 by the American National  Storytelling Network.  Wow.  It was an award together in Chicago.  Yes.  What were your first impressions of Oklahoma?  Not only Oklahoma, in America.  Was it your first time?  First time. First time I thought,    Oh  Very wide     (Laughs) And I could  28  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  not speak English well, but she cannot speak Japanese, but I still  understand. So that okay. (Laughs)  Sometimes we communicate by making a reference to a story that we  both know. That gets the concept across, because I know many stories  that I   ve heard from her, and she has heard many stories from me. So  that   s all we have to say. (Laughter)  First, I planned only one time to go to America. It may be my good  memory, but only one time. Then, America is not worst.  Not so bad?  Not so bad. (Laughter) Fran-san is a good person and even if my English  is not good. I can do it, I can tell story. So every year  I came , and  Stillwater is good most every year.  Yes, every time she came for a tour, we included Stillwater because we  had a lot of cooperation from Stillwater teachers, maybe because it   s a  university town and many international students and professors, they  understood that it was good to expose children to different languages  and different cultures. So it wasn   t so hard to arrange bookings in  Stillwater schools. It was generally an uphill fight in other places.    What  do you mean she doesn   t speak English ?    (Laughter) But once  somebody saw the program and realized that it was such fun and even  preschool children could understand, even adults could understand, then  they became very enthusiastic. Then it was their problem to convince the  authorities to let us come to the school.  And you   ve visited twenty-one states?  Yes. This, twenty   ?  I counted twenty-one.  Twenty-one, okay.  And you   ve been to Stillwater to tell stories twelve times, twelve different  years?  This is thirteenth time.  Yes. So Fran-san bridge from Bartlesville and Stillwater. I know  Bartlesville and Stillwater are familiar cities, in my memory.  But maybe the other towns are not so familiar.  29  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Yes.  We   ve been to some places more than once, but     Yes, but my brain is not good. (Laughter)  But in Stillwater, the students would look forward to you coming.  Yes   Now, some are in high school and still remember hearing your stories  when they were young.  Yes. Even adults, teachers, or today   s cooking lady.  At the Rise School, one of the cook   s assistants had been in school at  one of the elementary schools. She said,    Oh, Fujita-san  Oh, it   s an  honor to cook for her     (Laughter)  What are some of your favorite cultural differences?  Culture?  Do you have favorite foods here in Oklahoma?  Braum   s ice cream. (Laughter)  Things that you like here that you do not find in Japan.  Yes, many ice cream stores in Japan. When I am in Japan, I like Anko, or  Japanese cake. But  it   s not  ice cream, so I eat Japanese food in Japan.  In America, I can   t eat Japanese food, so Braums is wonderful   (Laughter)  So now, have you gathered stories from Fran, or that you have learned  in Oklahoma, and taken those back to Japan?  After I began visiting Japan, Young Yamanbas and other people said,     We heard your stories, but we want to see the text. We want to study  them.    So Fujita-san   s publisher published three books of my stories.  With the first two, they also made CDs of my telling the story in  English. The books are bilingual, so there is English on one side and  Japanese on the other side of each two-page spread. So adults could read  it either way. Some English teachers were using the English text and the  CD to help learn English.  30  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Yes Fran-san   s English is very nice, very clear. So Japanese can  understand. I learned from Fran, many stories also. Many Japanese learn  not only story, how to tell. How to tell, we learned Fran-san.  Baka gai-jin  wacky foreigner .  Staid Japanese adults were daunted by  the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions I needed to get the story  across without props or puppets. They teased me as baka gai-jin.   Baka gai- jin. (Laughs) Many things from Fran-san and Nancy-san,  many Stillwater teachers, I learn what is education or how to teach or  something. One thing, in Stillwater, one class has about ten or fifteen  children in kindergarten. In Japan, there are about thirty children and one  teacher. So wonderful, I think. So I tell the Japanese government thirty  children is too crowded, too many.    I know  America is ten or fifteen      (Laughter) Small classes are better.  Also, I remember at one school in the kindergarten class, they had a  poster with cups and colored straws. The children had been voting for  which was their favorite ice cream flavor, or which was their favorite  thing. They were comfortable if they didn   t all agree. That   s a different  concept from Japan because I   ve seen people, a group, go to a restaurant  and they study the menu and everyone orders the same thing, as if they  were eating at home. The idea of being comfortable with a different  opinion was interesting to her.  Yes, I learned many things from American schools. Not only the good  parts,  but  bad parts,  too . American schools have not-good parts, but  many, I think. (Laughs) The good part, I learned.  Do you want to talk about any of the bad parts?  Where, Washington or New York? I forgot. High school, safety check.  Oh, metal detectors.  Yes.  And a sign on the door saying,    No guns.     Yes.  But, American schools have no tobacco. She remembers, not too long  ago, where the teachers could smoke like crazy in the schools in Japan.  Yes.  31  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Right in front of the kids. I remember blue teacher   s lounges. If you  opened the teacher   s lounge, a puff of blue smoke would come out. Even  that is not permitted now.  Do you think teachers are more or less interested in incorporating  storytelling into their classrooms, with technology and all these things  today?  In Japan, or in America?  Either.  Do teachers use storytelling?  I know Nancy-san. Nancy-san was a storyteller teacher once.  Retired now.  Retired, but Japanese teacher, no teachers  are  storytellers. Storytelling  is not important in Japan.  In school.  In school.  Perhaps, just entertainment.  Yes.  What skills do you think children learn or build by engaging with a  storyteller?  When children listen to a storyteller, what do they learn?  Before that question, in Japan, children   mostly children do not listen.  They have no chance to listen to storytelling in Japan. Luckily, my  kindergarten, I tell stories, so they have a chance. A few schools have a  chance to listen to storytelling. But I think storytelling is very important  to young children kindergarten age, and first, second, third grade is the  most important, I think, because when I was at this age, I heard the tales  from the farmer. That was a very nice experience for me. So I want to  tell this age. Kindergarten to third grade age  is the  most important.  Middle school or high school is important, but most important is this  age, I think. But in Japan,  there is  no chance. Mostly children  have   no chance. Storytelling is    Today, this student hears a story. Next day,  32  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  they become good student. No, no, no, after ten years, twenty years,  maybe thirty years after, it is good. Storytelling is good because they  notice, but tomorrow and the next tomorrow, no good. So a Japanese  education person, boss of education person, doesn   t think about the  storytelling. Can you understand? (Laughs)  Yes, I think so. They want to see immediate results. In America they  want to see test scores, those must improve. The education is maybe  more for your heart or your problem solving skills, or something. It  doesn   t show on a standardized test right away, but is important.  I think. But boss of education person say want to soon.  They want results right away.  Well, you have developed a wonderful relationship with Fran. You have  visited Oklahoma thirteen times now since 1995. And in 2008, you were  honored with a Stillwater City Council Proclamation, declaring you     Storyteller Extraordinaire of Stillwater.    I   m just wondering, through  all of this relationship building through the years, what does Oklahoma  and your experience you   ve had here mean to you?  Relationship. I like stories and she likes stories. I tell stories very  naturally. She likes my storytelling way.  Style.  Style. I also like her storytelling style. Perhaps, she doesn   t love me, but  she does love my storytelling. (Laughter)  Fujita-san has thousands and thousands of extra grandchildren in  Oklahoma. They hear her stories and they want to go home with her.  They love her very much. They know she tells her stories from her heart.  She loves the stories and she wants to share something really nice.  And it has left such an impression on the children in our community and  everywhere you   ve visited.  We heard when we first started coming that the Sister Cities program  wanted to have a student exchange program with Kameoka    Stillwater   Middle School students going to Japan and Kameoka students coming  here. They could get Kameoka students but most Stillwater Middle  School students said,    Oh, what is Japan? Scary  We don   t want to go  there.    After a few years of Fujita coming to the elementary schools and  the middle school, children said,    When can we go to Japan ?     (Laughter) It really changed their feeling for Japan and we heard at that  33  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  time, made a big difference in their attitude. It   s wonderful to come back  again and see some students who were maybe middle school or high  school when we first started. Now they bring their children to hear  Fujita-san   s stories.  That   s wonderful.  Yes, wonderful. I think our storytelling style is similar. So maybe good  cooperation.  Teamwork.  Yes.  And she is very smart, clever. So my not good English word, she  corrects. (Laughs) So I understand.  I have lots of practice. And she is very, very clever at making beautiful,  wonderful, funny things out of milk cartons and paper towel cores and  all kinds of stuff. American pre-school teachers really like that because  at Rise School, we saw what a great budget can do for equipment, but  many schools don   t have that kind of money. So teachers have to collect  recyclables and make things. Teachers really appreciated your burglar  story. She said one day she came home and there was a draft. An  upstairs window was broken. So she called a glassier to come fix the  glass, but he recognized the work of a burglar who had been a cat  burglar   second story burglar   who had been working in the  neighborhood. They called the police and the police searched the house  trying to find what the burglar had stolen. They opened drawers and  boxes and they found milk cartons, egg crates, paper towel cores, and  they couldn   t find that anything had been stolen. They said,    I   m sorry,  ma   am, we think the burglar got discouraged.    (Laughter) American  preschool teachers and kindergarten teachers really understand that.  (Laughs) It   s the same necessity but they learn from her brothers and her  own clever mind. She   s made so many amazing, really inventive things  and she does workshops here, how to make things. That   s wonderful.  Thank you.  Very generous, please try, please do this, please learn.  Spreading the creativity.  Yes.  I was poor, so must make them. (Laughs)  34  Stallings  Wilson  Stallings  Teachers are poor, so they appreciate it.  Let   s talk about some of these books that we have here, written by  Fujita-san.  The first time Fujita-san came to America we attended the Texas  Storytelling Festival. They had some workshops and one of them was  given by Judy Nichols, who has written the book, Story Times for Two-  Year-Olds. Such a book did not exist in Japan and Fujita-san was so  pleased to see that someone writes books about how to tell stories and  how to work with young children. She went home, and she wrote the  first book of that kind in Japanese.  Then, when she brought some of these, all in Japanese, but showing how  to make things to use with storytelling, American teachers said,    Oh, I  want to learn this, but I can   t read that. It   s all in Japanese.    So I  developed the English version of it, and this was her first book published  in America from August House, we called it Stories to Play With, but  it   s mostly from this book. Then, as she toured more and more, people  wanted to learn more of her stories. Just with my computer, I made  Favorite Stories: Volume One and Two in English of stories that she told  with a few illustrations by Kobayashi-san, her friend. People wanted to  get those so that they could learn the stories and enjoy reading them  again.  Finally, from Libraries Unlimited, this is part of their World Folklore  series. So it could only have stories that are representative of all of Japan  so, I had to study scholarly collections and listings, indexes and find  which of Fujita-san   s four hundred stories were also known in some  version in the rest of Japan. This has forty-seven of the ones that seemed  most translatable to English. As part of their series, it also has a chapter  by a scholar of the history of Japan and a chapter by Sakurai-san about  the history of storytelling literature in Japan. In the back, it has recipes,  games, and other things because this World Folklore series is kind of a  cultural unit in a box, each one. Libraries Unlimited has about twenty for  different cultures, but this one represents Japan.  We wanted to make 400 stories, we wanted to share them in English  because when I was doing research, also, I didn   t use stories that were  widely known in English already, like Momotaro and Kaguyahime.  There is a kind of cannon of Japanese folklore, like our Cinderella,  Snow White, Sleeping Beauty stories that are widely translated. I didn   t  need to publish those, but Fujita-san helped me. So now, these have  become available to American teachers and storytellers.  35  Wilson  Stallings  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Fujita  Stallings  Wilson  Wow, that   s wonderful. And this is a beautiful book. Who did the  illustrations?  Kobayashi-san.  My friend.  This shows July 7, summertime celebration. Children are catching  fireflies and decorating bamboo with the Milky Way and stars, so it   s a  night scene. That is why everything is blue.  Well, I really want to thank you for visiting with me today. It   s been  wonderful.  Yes,  I hope I spoke of  the things you wanted.  We hope you got answers you can use.  Certainly, it was wonderful.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
