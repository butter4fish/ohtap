 L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Today is June 26, 2009. My name is Latasha Wilson and I am in  Stillwater, Oklahoma at the home of Billie Wilson. I am interviewing her  today on some of her memories growing up in southwestern Oklahoma  in the 1930s and beyond  as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Project   of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Oklahoma State  University Library. Grandma, thank you for allowing me to record some  of your stories today. Let   s start off by having you tell me a little bit  about your early years, where you were born, and about your family.  Well, I was born in southwest Oklahoma   Tipton, Oklahoma. My  parents were from Wise County, Texas and my daddy had two brothers.  Daddy   s name was Jack. There was Jack, John, and Minor Fitzgerald.  They were three brothers that came from Texas. Minor was the oldest of  the brothers and I think they thought that we needed help in taking care  of getting settled in Oklahoma. I   ll never forget Uncle Minor, and Aunt  Lou was his wife   s name. And she, Aunt Lou  maiden name Hasley ,  was Raenell   s aunt.  Your friend Raenell.  Yes, my friend Raenell. Raenell and I weren   t kinfolks but good friends,  we went to school together.  So what year were you born?  1925. September the 30th, 1925. I first started to school at Lang, or  Number One   it   s a country school   that was my first experience at  going to school. And I   ll never forget riding the see-saws. That was the  biggest thing that we did that I hadn   t been used to. But I was kind of  dreading, actually, going to Tipton. Now we   d go to Tipton to buy  groceries and we would go for the 5 o   clock drawing on Saturdays. They  always had a drawing. Mr. Patton, you could hear him all over town,  hollering,    It   s time to come and get registered and be ready for the  drawing  and the blue light special .    And of course we were there.  5  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Everybody all around the county would be there waiting to see if they  were going to draw their name, just like we were doing the same thing,  my folks were.  Did you ever win?  No, I didn   t, but see I was still a kid. But we were always there. And  sometimes some of the grocery stores would have people registering just  in their grocery store and maybe take home a load of groceries that they  were giving away. But I started to school at Tipton in the third grade.  We were living in this other area where I was born, the Lang  Community. But I was kind of dreading starting school at Tipton  because it was a larger school first of all and I didn   t know anybody  there, because I   d been going to school at Lang. But it didn   t take long  to get acquainted and play on the see-saws and, you know, the usual  things that playgrounds have. My daddy was farming. Uncle Minor was  a brother, and Waymon was Uncle Minor   s son and so we moved there  on that place where they did farm and where they lived. And so Jack  Fitzgerald, my daddy, and my mother, Myrtle Francis Petty from Boyd,  Texas, they had married and they moved to Oklahoma. And then Daddy  had a brother named John, John Nicholas was his name. My daddy   s  name was Andrew Jackson Fitzgerald. (Laughs) Made for a long name.  And he went by Jack.  Jack. Everybody called him Jack. And he was a real friendly person, if  he could find anybody to talk to, his day was made cause he loved to  talk and ask questions about other people and maybe their kinfolks, et  cetera. But I was dreading starting to school at Tipton because I didn   t  know anybody at Tipton unless they went to church there, I might know  them then. But that wasn   t like going to school with them, you know.  But anyway, I   ll never forget, I started to school at Tipton in the third  grade and our teacher   s name was Ms.  Marie  Rogers. They lived out  east of Tipton and she lived with some of her kinfolks because she was a  teacher and she didn   t have a place. But these people at   Grimes I  believe was their name, and so she lived with them. I really, really liked  this teacher, Ms. Rogers. I soon got acquainted with several kids there.  My Daddy   s older brother, Minor Fitzgerald, had passed away, and so  we moved to where Uncle Minor used to live.  Was  his son Waymon  about your age?  They were older. I was the youngest one. But see, now Raenell Vernon,  she was Raenell Boyd, but she was also kin to Waymon. Waymon had  married Raenell   s aunt, I believe.  They went to California.   6  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  And you also had a sister.  I have a sister, yes, Bobbie. We were Billie and Bobbie. I was three  years older than Bobbie and she started to school at Tipton, but see I  started to school at Lang or Number One. But that   s been a long time  ago. There was some people there and I don   t know if I need to mention  their name or not, but I was scared of them. (Laughter) They were the  McDonalds and they were, some of them, kind of rowdy and might get  drunk and get put in jail and different things. But nonetheless, when my  daddy   s oldest brother, Minor, passed away my daddy bought the place  where Uncle Minor used to live. That old place there, that house was  there. And I can remember thinking that that house was really big and it  was really nice. But I was just a little kid then.  So what do you remember about school in Tipton?  Well, it was different in that there were a lot more kids at Tipton and I  didn   t know hardly anybody. If they went to church, the Church of  Christ there where we went, I might kind of, a little bit, know them.  But did you make friends quickly?  I think so. Everybody liked to play on the see-saws. We had the see-saws  there and we learned how to go down the fire escape. They trained  us in that right quick because we were upstairs. When we were in the  fourth grade, we were upstairs at the school. But it was a lot larger  school than Number One, of course. Number One was a country school  and the Tipton school was in Tipton itself.  Do you remember the subjects? Your favorite classes?  Well it seems like I liked geography because it covered quite a bit of,  well history and it just covered more than the earlier subjects.  Do you remember what year you graduated high school?  1943, I believe. And then your Grandpa Aubrey and I got married on  June the 16th, 1946.  So what did you do right after high school?  Okay, that was back during  what came to be  called World War II.  In 1944?  1943,    44 along in there.  7  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  So what did you do?  I worked. Anybody that worked for the government had to take a civil  service test, which is just kind of some common knowledge, which I  wasn   t too bright. (Laughs) But anyway, we took this test and I did good  on it. I was glad of that. But I always made good grades. It was at the top  of my list to have good grades and to always be there. I was very seldom  out of school for any reason. Even if I didn   t feel good I wanted to be  there, you know. Didn   t want to get behind. We had Ms. Rogers, Marie  Rogers was our third grade teacher. I really liked her, but she wasn   t  very large at all. She was small and kind of prissy (Laughs) which I  thought was pretty cool. I can remember thinking,    She   s just got it  made.    Now she was the third grade teacher. Our fourth grade teacher  was Helen Maynard and we really liked her. But you know how you like  your school teachers, they can do no wrong.  I   ve got to tell this   I had gotten a birthstone ring for Christmas and  somehow or the other I managed to lose the stone out of that ring on the  playground. So I showed it to the teacher and asked if I could go look  for it. Well can you imagine looking for a stone, a birthstone, out of a  ring, especially a kid   s ring. But the teacher let me go. And so then I got  worried that I   d stayed too long, so I just gave it up. I thought,    Well it   s  gone.    And I never did see it. You know, finding a stone out of a ring is  hard because there   s all kinds of rocks and pebbles and things on  playgrounds. But I don   t think I ever retrieved that ring and, of course, I  had gotten it for Christmas and it just kind of broke my heart, but there  wasn   t much you could do about it, you know. It   s pretty hard to really  pinpoint anything  on a playground .  But she did let you go look for it.  Yes, she did. But I got worried. I always wanted to be on the teacher   s  side. I didn   t want to stay out there very long because I thought maybe  they   d think that I was just killing time. And I really wasn   t, I was trying  to look for that silly stone in the ring. So it was just a lost cause.  Did you ever play any sports in school?  Not really. Now we played basketball, we had a basketball goal and  things on our playground. But as far as that, that was the end of my  career as far as sports or anything goes, you know. No, I was not really  an active sports gal. When I got older and got married, my husband was  an enthusiastic sportsman. He loved to go to the games. And we went to  games far and wide. And of course we were for Tipton always, hollering  and yelping.  8  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Did you have an illness sometime in your childhood or a time when you  were in the hospital?  Yes, and actually I thought I was going to die.  How old were you?  I was about probably 10 or 12. I was born in 1925 and I think this was in  1937, so that would be 12 years, but I   m not quite sure. But I had kind of  a narrow escape during that time because I got sick like on a Saturday,  real sick, and my daddy took me to the doctor at Tipton. We knew him  personally, Dr. Childress was his name. And he said to my daddy,    Jack,  I can take her to Frederick and do surgery there,    he thought it needed to  be done right then. Well we had just had an aunt   Aunt Minnie who  was Uncle John   s wife   who had just died at that very hospital. She   d  had a new baby and the baby died and she did too. Well Aunt Minnie  was, of course, one of our closest,  most  dearly loved relatives. They  had come from down around Boyd, Texas and they had traveled to  Oklahoma because their brother, Minor, had gotten to Oklahoma and he  couldn   t wait for them to hurry up and get on out to Oklahoma. So  anyway, that   s kind of what revved all that up. But I can remember  being very ill at that time.  What was wrong with you?  I had a ruptured appendix, it had broken. And you can die from that. The  appendix can be a dangerous thing if it breaks. I don   t know all the  details about it, Tasha, but I know if it breaks, it   s bad news.  So where did you go if you didn   t go to Frederick?  Well, the doctors sent us to, I believe, Elk City. It seems like it was Elk  City to the hospital there. I  think the doctor   s name was Dr. Shadid  but  he knew what to do. If we hadn   t gone to him, I made myself believe  that I wouldn   t be alive today or years ago if it hadn   t been for that  doctor.  So how long were you in the hospital?  Well quite awhile. Quite awhile.  Maybe three weeks.  When you have a  ruptured appendix, however much poison or whatever it is that   s in there  causing all this can just flood your body. You have a real battle on your  hands when you have that. But anyway, I was about 12 years old  thereabout. I got over it, I surely did, but I attribute it to having good  doctors.  9  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  So tell me a little bit about life in southwestern Oklahoma in the 1930s.  Did you know that there was a Depression going on?  I don   t know that we knew there was a Depression, but we knew that  money was scarce. My mother, Myrtle Francis Petty Fitzgerald, was a  seamstress. She could sew anything, and did. She made all of our  clothes, even coats she made. And we   ve always felt like that we were  well-dressed, you know, had plenty of clothes. And mostly we didn   t  have enough closet  space  for the clothes that we had. (Laughs)  Where did she get her fabric?  There at Tipton. Jimison Lee   s was the name of the store. We bought our  shoes there. There were two men, they were brother-in-laws, Mr.  Jimison and Mr. Lee. And we really liked Mr. Lee, but Mr. Jimison was  more like a   oh I hate to use the word sourpuss, but he just wasn   t a  friendly type guy. But Mr. Lee was, he really was. I   ll never forget Mr.  Lee. He was a tall, nice-looking person and I think they had one son  maybe. And Mr. Jimison, I think he had two or three kids. But anyway,  times were hard and we might have a nickel to spend on Saturday. But  those were hard times evidently for everybody.  What did your father farm?  Well they raised cotton. That was the biggest crop. The land was pretty  sandy and that   s not too good. It   s okay to have a little sand, but not a  lot. But we had to chop cotton   I mean go through row by row and get  the weeds out of the field because the weeds drained the moisture from  your crop. When the weeds are out here growing, meanwhile your cotton  is sitting here starving for some kind of moisture to keep it going. And  we didn   t have irrigation at that time at all, just didn   t have.  So you and your sister would help in the cotton field.  Yeah.  Who else would help?  Well Pappy Jacks would hire some people, maybe a family that had to  work. We didn   t just have to work to have something to eat, but some  people did. We had some people that came there and they wanted to just  pitch a tent in our backyard. We lived out in the Lang community at that  time. And so they pitched a tent there out away from our house in the  backyard area. And I   ll never forget them, because they had a bunch of  little puppies and those little old dogs all had a name like Shookie and I  can   t remember their names, but they were cute. But as we got older, we  10  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  had to help do more work, you know.  What were some of your chores?  Well, I learned to milk cows for one thing. And I remember climbing up  on our barn and it was really tall, way up there. If my mother had known  that, she   d have had a conniption fit  (Laughs) But I remember climbing  up there. Oh my goodness   So what was chopping cotton like?  Well it was hot as all get out. It was just hot as the dickens. (Laughs)  Hot and blazing, I mean the dirt was hot and you could feel it through  your shoes. But it wasn   t anything that took a lot of talent, you just had  to get your hoe and when you saw a weed, chop that weed down. And it  could wilt just as soon as you chopped it. When you chopped it, if you  did a good job chopping it, the moisture would no longer be going into  that  weed . And so my daddy really wanted us to be sure that we get all  the weeds, every one of them and don   t leave any in the field. So we had  to listen to what he said, of course. But I can remember that barn like it  was yesterday. It was a real big barn and it was pretty tall. And I  remember climbing on top of that barn. Just climbed up there, walked  around. If I   d have fallen over there, I   d have probably broken my neck.  What was stored in the barn?  Well just everything that we had that you wouldn   t put in the house.  Feed, you   d have feed that you would feed your animals, like the horses.  And we had the horses   we had Mink, we had Kate   just plain K-A-T-E;  Mink and Kate. We had some others but I can   t think of their names  right now.  What other animals did you have?  Well, we had the horses. We always had cattle. My daddy planted some  kind of feed, Hi-gear or some kind of plant that cattle would eat. We had  a real good barn and we liked to play in the barn. It had an upstairs and  you could   ve stored hay or whatever you wanted to upstairs. But Bobbie  and I decided we   d make a playhouse upstairs, so we made a playhouse.  Did you help your mom do laundry?  My daddy would build a fire and we had what you call a wash pot. He   d  have it practically full of water but he had to leave enough room for  clothes because that   s where you washed your clothes, in the wash pot.  11  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Outside?  Outside. And we wanted to be sure they were good and clean and  sterilized and all that kind of stuff. (Laughs)  How would you bathe?  Well, we had a big tin tub. A big tin tub and we   d have to heat water, put  some warm water in there and maybe cold too, to get it just the right  temperature. It was kind of in the olden days. (Laughs)  That   s what I want to hear about   But one great sadness that we had during that period of time was Uncle  John   s wife, Aunt Minnie, died and she   d had a new baby at Fredrick,  Oklahoma and we never could figure out how could that possibly  happen. The little baby died and she did too. And Uncle John married  later on, I don   t remember how long, but it was quite awhile after Aunt  Minnie died. He just couldn   t hardly stand to be by himself. But we   d  always been around Aunt Minnie and Uncle John, just real close to  them. And then my mother had a sister, Aunt Mamie, Mamie was her  name. Now she and mother were Pettys. Their parents were Tully and  Granny Petty   s name was  Laura Jane Purcer . But  where  I went to  school at Lang, there were a few people who lived around in the area  there. There wasn   t a whole lot of people there, but our school bus  would just be loaded down with kids from back out in the country.  So how long would it take you to get to school on the school bus?  Well it   d take awhile, I don   t know, I was just a little kid. But we had  kind of a big route. It went way up not too far from Snyder, which would  be north of us. Our main thing that we did was to play jacks and jump  rope. I remember doing that out there at the Lang school.  Our cousin   Waymon was married to Vera Hastley. Vera was a sister to Raenell  Boyd or Raenell Vernon   s   her married name   s Vernon   mother.  So did you have a car to move in?  Yes. I remember when we got this brand new Model A Ford car, got it at  Snyder. I remember we got in that car and Mother got behind the  steering wheel. (Laughs) She drove like she   d been driving a car forever  and a day. Oh, mercy sakes.  So you would drive that to town on Saturdays, to Tipton?  Yes. And they always had a 5 o   clock drawing.  12  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Would you ever go to a movie?  I think we did, but not many. Seems like it was 25 cents, that it cost.  Do you remember hearing about the Public Works Projects? The WPA  projects?  Yes, yes. There were people who could qualify for that, you had to be  really, really poor to get in on that.  So did you know people that worked on that?  I may have, but you know, we were kind of not too proud of that in that I  think we thought we could make it on our own, which is what we  basically did. I remember feeding cattle and each animal had their own  stall. By that I mean Daddy had built a barn and he had made divisions  to where about eight different sets of animals could walk into that area  and eat. And you know what, horses and cattle learn where their stall is.  And if one of them gets in the other one   s stall, the fight   s on. I mean  they can nab at each other and maybe one of them will leave because he  doesn   t want to be bitten by this other one.  So would your cows be slaughtered?  Not our cows, but calves. But we would take them to   well I don   t  remember, I can   t remember if Daddy actually slaughtered them and  then took the meat to the   there was a place in Tipton that put in a  freezer type thing and you could rent one of those to put your own meat  in. Well see we didn   t have a way to keep the meat unless we canned it  or something like that. This other was so much simpler, to just freeze it  and then we could walk into the freezer. We   d have a key with our  number on it, whatever that number might be, and so we could just walk  in there and our key would fit our locker where we had our meat stored  in there.  Did you have any kind of refrigeration in your home?  No.  How did you keep milk and things cool?  Well, we had a window, I think it was on the west is what I think. But I  remember them hanging water or cold cup towels or something that you  could maybe dip in cold water or a little ice or something. And see an  ice man delivered ice around out in the country.  13  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  How often?  He came from Manitou. Well it wasn   t very often, but we wrapped it up  in quilts to preserve it so it   d last a longer time. We liked iced tea and we  just liked to have some ice. And so we did that.  What foods do you remember eating growing up?  Well we always had good food. I mean Mother was a good cook and we  didn   t just eat sandwiches and stuff like that like we do even today.  She   d have all out cooking. I mean she could cook the best beans. Just  soak your beans and then cook them and they were always good. She  could really cook beans real good.  And she has an amazing cornbread recipe doesn   t she?  Yes, yes. She made good cornbread and you know, if you haven   t ever  eaten cornbread and good pinto beans, people just haven   t eaten yet.  (Laughs) But it was always good. Mother was a good cook.  What would you do for your birthday?  Well, we didn   t usually have much of a big shindig or anything at all.  What about Christmas or Thanksgiving?  At Christmas we always had a good Christmas. And we would leave  food for Santy Claus, have it setting out there, you know, on the table  somewhere where he would be sure and find it. (Laughs) Oh goodness  alive. But I had a good growing up time. I couldn   t have asked for better  parents, no way under the sun. Daddy worked hard. He was a hard  worker, he always was. And I learned how to milk and we could drive  the cattle up. They   d be out maybe in a pasture there somewhere not too  far all the way on the place and we could drive the cattle up and I wasn   t  afraid of them. Didn   t seem to be, I don   t recall being afraid of them.  But I remember a real dumb thing that I did and that was climb on top of  that barn, which was just almost straight up.  What did you do when you got up there?  Well I guess I wished I was back down  (Laughs) I don   t know, Tasha. I  don   t know what the point of it was, just to see if I could I guess.  Do you remember your parents discussing politics very much?  No, not really.  14  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  Do you remember hearing much about President Roosevelt and how  they felt about him?  Yeah, they liked him. They did, I remember that. I know that they liked  him. I think they thought that he had solved all problems, that he was a  good person   and I think he was a good person. I don   t know how much  influence the other politicians had on him, but I can remember me  hearing them talk about it. It was like he was the lifesaver, you might  say.  Did you have a radio in your home?  Not at that time. I can   t remember when we got a radio. People used to  listen to George Burns and Gracie Allen on Saturday nights. We had  plenty of food to eat. Mother always canned and we had all kinds of  canned vegetables and she was a good cook and they were good  providers. We always had nice clothes. Mother sewed. She made all of  our clothes and we were always properly dressed. We had a good  childhood.  And some families nearby worked with the WPA, like the Fields family?  Uh-huh, right.  Do you remember what they did?  Well they didn   t own anything. There were people like that that didn   t  own anything. I mean just the clothes on their backs, so to speak. Well,  Mrs. Fields, we really, really liked her   well we liked all of them. We  didn   t really care for him too much, but they didn   t own anything that I  can recollect at all. But he would walk everywhere he went. He walked  to Tipton   wherever he was going, he walked. He didn   t have any other  way. And of course we had a car, such as it was. But I remember us  getting that Model A car. It had a front seat and a back seat and plenty of  room for us kids and for our parents.  Do you remember going to visit your grandparents?  Yes.  Where did they live?  Wise County, Texas.  How often would you go visit?  15  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  No more than once a year, that was it.  What would you do when you visited them?  Well, the first thing we liked to do was to go to Fort Worth or some big  town around. Fort Worth wasn   t too far away, but we liked to go there  because they had these big stores and you could just get lost in a big  store. (Laughs) But I remember us doing that, and we really thought we  were in high cotton whenever we got in one of those big stores because  they had everything in the world, you know. And we were just little old  country kids.  Did your grandparents ever come visit you?  I think, as I can recall, I think that Granny and maybe Granddad, I can   t  remember for sure if Granddad came or not. But Mother had developed  cancer and they came to see her. I think it was just Granny and maybe  one of the sons that brought her. See, Mother died at age 48 and it was  devastating. When you lose your mother, you   ve lost your best friend.  That   s really true.  Do you remember hearing about the Dust Bowl or having any effects of  the Dust Bowl hit you?  It hit every area in that area because there was a lot of sandy land, and  our farm was one that was a sandy land, it still is sandy. It   ll always be  sandy. The wind blows and you can   t stop the wind, and you can just  plow, go up a row and then skip a row and then come down a row or  whatever, but you   re not going to do much with sand blowing and the  wind blowing. It   s hard to control, it really, really is. Everybody   s land  wasn   t like that, but ours was. We had neighbors   well, you know  Claxton  Cook , they were probably our closest neighbor. And we knew  all the kids that rode on the school bus and, of course, everybody knew  where they belonged. (Laughs)  So how would you keep the dust out of your house?  I have come home when I was a kid and Mother would have an old  bedspread or something that wasn   t really worth a lot   or it had seen it   s  better days, so to speak   hanging in between the rooms or between the  room and the outside to try to keep the dirt out. It was that bad. The Dust  Bowl was really and truly, it was a dust bowl. It was more than a dust  bowl, it was just awful. I mean you could   ve cleaned house every day,  seven days a week and still not got it all out, probably. And see, we had  a wash pot, a big black, on the outside, wash pot and we did our laundry  in that wash pot. And then we had tubs to rinse our clothes in, see. And  16  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  it was kind of a big thing, wash day was, back in those days. It wasn   t  easy. It wasn   t like it is now. It wasn   t like,    Oh, I   ll run down here and  spend 25 or 50 cents and get the laundry done.    It   d take all day. And  then you would have to hang it up to dry on the clothesline and possibly  the clothesline could break   Do you remember anyone taking off and heading for California?  Well, I can   t say that I can recall a name. But I think that there were  people who did, who just left. If they had land that was   and most  everybody was pretty much a farmer back in our area. And when the dirt  would get up and blow, it could blow their top soil clear slap dab away  and their land was just almost useless. I mean it really took its toll, the  wind did. But I can remember about that time, it was during that era, that  I got sick on a Saturday. And Mother wanted Daddy to take me to the  doctor at Tipton. I think the doctor was not on call on Saturdays and I  think Daddy went to the doctor   s home to tell him about me and we  went that very night, pitch dark, Mother   s sick, couldn   t go. We went to  Elk City, Oklahoma, which was about 90 miles away to a doctor there  that Daddy had strong confidence in. Well if it hadn   t been for him, I  wouldn   t be here today. That   s just the short story. If it hadn   t been for  him, as a child I didn   t know if I was going to live or not. My appendix  had ruptured, had broken, and it was going into my system.  What did you do to make up the school time that you missed?  Well I was a pretty good student. I always made good grades and I think  that when I got back to school, I just joined in with them wherever we  were on school.  Do you remember any songs or musicians from the early years?  No. I remember our third grade teacher   s name. (Laughs) Marie Rogers.  She was a small person, she wasn   t very tall, and she was a   seems like  she used to say something to the effect like    any person, place, or thing,     she used those kind of terms now and then, just all in a row like that, and  I had lost my stone in that ring and I never did find it. I told her about it  and she let me go look. You can   t find a stone in a ring on a rough  playground. Somebody else may   ve found it, but they probably thought  it   s just a rock, you know, just a rough stone.  Did you live near the railroad at all? Do you remember any gypsies or  hobos or anyone coming through?  I think we were leery, we were kind of afraid of people like that. I don   t  know if they did or not, but we lived a closed life. We weren   t out  17  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  gallivanting around to see where all we could go or anything like that.  We just didn   t. Bobbie and I, neither one were old enough to drive a car,  so we certainly weren   t out, and they kind of held tight reigns on us.  (Laughs)  How old were you when you did start driving a car?  Well you had to have your driver   s license and I think you had to be at  least what, 16, thereabout. It seems like we got our license at Frederick  because it   s the county seat of Tillman County. I remember being really  proud of that, but still, you can   t just be out running up and down the  highway burning gas for no reason. But we had plenty to eat, Mother  was a good seamstress, she made every kind of clothes that we could  possibly need: coats, all kinds of summer and winter clothes, you know.  And on Sunday you would go to church in Tipton?  Yes and Bible class. Well we called it Sunday School then. Sunday  School, we always did. My daddy evidently had always been in the  church. Evidently his parents had been members of the church down in  Texas. Mother   s folks were not. They were not. I thought about that  many times. Here poor old Granny Petty is, getting up in years, never  sees the inside of a church building, does not go to church. And Daddy  might bring it up to her once in awhile but she didn   t want to hear about  it. And so you know, you can   t go into somebody   s home and preach a  sermon. And my daddy was kind of like that. It was just like he wanted  to save them some way, but they didn   t want to be, you know. But now  Granddad could chew tobacco and he   d call Granny    Ma    and he   d say     Ma, hand me this    or    Ma, hand me that.    And he   d have a spittoon  there, tobacco. It was just     This is your mother   s father?  Granddad Petty. But Granny was a good old soul and she raised geese,  she had a lot of geese, and they were just kind of like her children. I  mean they would just follow her around. I guess they knew she had the  feed and they   d follow her  But we didn   t get to see them more than  probably once a year. We   d usually try to go before school would start  back. We liked to go. But people didn   t run around then like they do  now, at all.  We were talking about your time in high school in Tipton, Oklahoma  and you had a job in high school?  Yes.  18  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  What was that?  Okay, I worked at the drug store. I worked at McDonald Drug Store and  I think the one that was just called Tipton Drug Store. There were two  drug stores in Tipton. And oh, I thought I was in high cotton. I have a  picture of me here somewhere and I was going across the street for some  reason, I don   t know what, but I   m standing right in the middle of  crossing the street in Tipton. (Laughs)  So what did you do at the drug store?  Oh, just whatever needed to be done. I mean if they needed something  mixed up, well I better know how to mix it, you know.  And who was your boss?  Paul Largent. And he was a very, very quiet man. He could laugh, but  not very often. But on Christmas morning he invited all of the girls   and  there was several of us who worked for him   to his house and they had  a real nice breakfast but I can   t remember much about what we did. I  guess we ate and I don   t know what else, maybe just talk, girl talk. But  Paul Largent was a very quiet man. There was no foolishness about Paul  Largent that I ever did see. He was just a nice quiet man. He had a wife  and they had children. I was just glad to have a job.  Do you remember how much you got paid?  No, but I know it wasn   t any big enormous salary.  And then you did really well in high school.  Yes.  And when you graduated, did you have a special recognition?  Salutatorian. Salutatorian, that word is about this long. There   s  Valedictorian, that   s the top one, and then there   s Salutatorian. I think I  was pretty devastated that I wasn   t Valedictorian, but there were two or  three of us that really did well in school.  Do you remember how many people you graduated with?  Well, not really. But I   d say in the 20s, early 20s, maybe 23 or  something like that.  And then right after high school, what did you do?  19  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  Okay, we took a   when I say    we,    Delsea Faye and I, we were good  friends. If we had to go somewhere to live and we both could have a job,  that was good. So they put in an air base at Frederick and one at Altus.  Well, of course we never did go to Altus back in those days, but we did  go to Frederick usually to maybe do a little Christmas shopping or  something. But anyway, we didn   t do much   we had to walk  everywhere we went, we did not have a car.  In Frederick?  Our folks just didn   t have the money to buy us a car.  How did you get to Frederick?  They took us. I mean, like if we wanted to go home for a few days,  which wasn   t common, and if we went it was on a weekend, but then  we   d have to be back, see.  And where did you live?  It was just as far as you could go without getting out of Frederick I  guess.  Well you and Delsea Faye lived together with another couple?  Well, with some folks that we knew. They were friends of the Gross  family, it was Edgar and Molly Williams, that   s who it was. And the  only way they had to get around was in an old truck. But everywhere  they went, they went in this old truck. But they were conservative-like  people and they had one daughter, Inez. I never did like that name.  (Laughter) I didn   t tell them that  We had these older friends, Edgar and  Molly Williams and they were just almost like clowns. I mean they both  were jolly and jovial and it was just like a circus almost going on all the  time. (Laughs) But anyway, they were good friends at Frederick and we  lived there with them until we could get signed up for a government  house down there out east of the swimming pool at Frederick. Well they  had built a new area and people that worked for the government could  live in those houses, so Delsea Faye and I signed up to live there. So I  think we lived there for a little while.  What did you do in your work?  Well, it was like you might say bookkeeping. It   s just records of what  was going on.  For the government?  20  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  Yes.  And this is during World War II. Did you know anyone who went to  war?  Yes. Let   s see, Delsea Faye had several brothers. Charlie Dave got killed  in that war. Let   s see, they had Clayton, he was the oldest boy. Then  they had Joe Kenneth, then they had Charlie Dave. And I think that he  volunteered, but the reason was that all these other brothers and friends  were going to war, signing up for the service. I don   t think he would   ve  had to since he could   ve been called a provider for his mother. I don   t  know all the ins and outs about that. But anyway, that   s basically when  we worked at Frederick was when that second war was going on.  How long did you work there?  Well I can   t really remember. I could draw a continual salary. We had  signed up to work there   I can   t remember all the details, too long ago.  Well let   s talk about when you moved back, you met a gentleman. How  did you first meet Grandpa?  Your grandpa was   I can hardly remember exactly what brought us  together. It seems like we were at Frederick at something and we just  kind of got started talking, you know how casual you start out. (Laughs)  But I really liked him and evidently he really liked me. In Frederick,   when government housing became available, Delsea Faye and I   thought,    Well fiddly-dee, we can have a house of our own here.    I  mean, we didn   t own it but we could pay rent to them instead of living  with somebody else. So we did that and usually what we would do  would be to go home, go back to Tipton on sometime Sunday morning.  Sometimes a train would be going back to Tipton. I can   t remember if  they did that all the time, but I know that we did that some. And then my  daddy would bring us back to Frederick that evening. But you know,  back then you just didn   t have much choice about where to work. There  was work, but still, could you meet the criteria, could you meet the goals  of whatever it is you had to do, to be, or whatever. But I remember  living there at Frederick and we went to church there at Frederick, but  everywhere we went we had to walk. We did not have a car.  And Aubrey was from Tipton?  Yes.  So you met him back at Tipton.  21  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Yeah, I knew who he was, of course.  And how long did you date?  Well, I don   t know if I can remember that long. It didn   t take very long  for us to fall for each other. (Laughs)  Do you remember details of your wedding?  Well, I remember I bought a new suit. It seems like we went to  Oklahoma City shopping for wedding clothes. I wore a suit, it wasn   t a  wedding dress, but it was a suit with a blouse and all. But I thought that I  had found   and I still think it   that I had found Mr. Perfect. There  could not be a finer person than Aubrey Wilson. He was a good man and  he was fun. He was entertaining, complimentary. It was just my time to  take him over. (Laughs)  So where would you go on dates?  We   d usually go to Frederick.  Just out to eat or to the movies?  We   d go to the movies some.  Do you remember any good movies of the day?  Well it seems like I ought to, but right off I can   t remember what the  movies were back then.  You mentioned Gone with the Wind.  Yes. Now we saw Gone with the Wind I guess at Frederick. Frederick  was a pretty good size town at that time. And then of course we hardly  ever, ever went to Altus. That was the wrong direction, it was back this  way from where we lived and Frederick was right there, right close to  where we lived.  So where did you get married?  We got married at the preacher   s house in Tipton, Oklahoma.  Did you go on a honeymoon?  Yes. I think it was Vernon, Texas is where we went.  22  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  And New Mexico?  Probably on to  Ruidoso,  New Mexico. I think that was Aubrey   s idea  was for us to go on to New Mexico.  And then you came back to Tipton and when did you move onto your  farm?  Well, let   s see. Aubrey had this uncle, Doc Boyd, and they farmed  together. Aubrey   s daddy died when Aubrey was four years old and Doc  was married to Aubrey   s mother   s sister. But she lost her memory, her  mind, or something. It was a pretty serious thing, you know. Doc could  get all upset over nothing real fast, like things that he wanted them to do  was to do it yesterday, you know. He was always in a hurry. And I  didn   t like for him to fuss at Aubrey at all. I think he tried to not sound  fussy, but he was. He was a good person and I think he left whatever he  owned in this world to Aubrey and they owned the land together. But  who else would put up with Doc?  (Laughs)  So the farm you moved into and raised your children in that is now a  Centennial Farm, who owned that initially?  Well, we do.  But who lived there before you?  It was rented out to somebody, I can   t even     Was it in Grandpa   s side of the family that owned it?  Yes. See Aubrey grew up over in that area actually. Doc was in the  family when Aubrey and I got married, because now and then he   d say,     Au-brey     and it would just burn me up. I   d think,    Why is he hollering  at him?    (Laughs) You hate for anybody to holler at your husband  But  of course he helped raise Aubrey. Aubrey   s mother was a sister to Doc   s  wife. Doc   s wife, I never did see, she had a mentality problem. Aubrey  was always one of these guys that was easily embarrassed and he just  didn   t want to invite anybody home with him because of her. She   d get  out and walk or run, maybe in the pasture. It was just something that  Aubrey could not bring himself to hardly tolerate. I don   t mean it to  sound like that, but that   s basically   he was easily embarrassed, in other  words, is what I   m saying.  So then Aubrey farmed.  Yes.  23  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Did he mostly grow cotton? And what else?  Yeah they grew cotton and they irrigated the cotton. He lived with his  Uncle Doc, but I wasn   t going to live with Uncle Doc, you know, that  wasn   t my cup of tea. I didn   t want to live with anybody else but Aubrey  Wilson. And Aubrey knew that and so we lived in our own house.  Do you remember what year you moved to your farm?  You mean where we live now? Well we got married in 1946 so we lived  there then. I mean we got married and we moved there. We had furniture  and we had a washing machine, we even had a clothes dryer  later . The  reason we had that, I   d been after Aubrey about tightening the  clothesline and he   d put it off till the next time, and then the next time,  and on. Finally one of our neighbors,  Wilma Hunter , drove up for  some reason and I don   t know how come, have no clue, can   t remember  why she came by, but anyway, I had clothes hanging on the line because  we didn   t have a dryer then. While she was there, the clothesline broke   The clothes were just a flopping and all but tearing up, the wind was  blowing so hard. So it broke and Wilma left. And of course I had to stay  there. (Laughs) I couldn   t leave. I couldn   t leave our clothes on the  ground or out dragging through the dirt  But believe me, Aubrey Wilson  got busy and fixed the clothesline.  And then before too long you got a dryer?  Yes.  When did you get electricity?  Well, I think we always had electricity there in that house.  Well then you went on to have four sons in the 1950s.  Right. Randy in    51, Barry in    53, Danny in    55. And Terry  in    58 .  And then you stayed at home and raised them and helped farm.  I could drive the tractor, I knew how to run the irrigation, and we  irrigated out of that big lake. Aubrey and his Uncle Doc had that lake  enlarged so we could irrigate our cotton there close by. And so it was a  blessing in disguise, it really was. I learned how to drive that green  tractor down there. (Laughs) I drove that tractor and anyway, we got that  fixed to where we could irrigate, I don   t remember how many acres it  was, but any would help, run that irrigation over into the cotton, get the  irrigation over into where the cotton was growing but needed rain. Well  24  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  you don   t just get rain just because you need it. That   s not the way  southwest Oklahoma operates.  What about plowing?  I knew how to plow. I plowed and I could turn around at the end of the  row on a nickel or a dime. But I think Aubrey was glad that I knew how  to drive the tractor. We just lacked a little being married 57 years.  Do you remember what year you started helping at South Side school?  Well I worked there 21 years.  As a teacher   s aide?  Yes, a teacher   s assistant. And I loved every minute of it. Of course, I  knew everybody there already. But I really liked working there, I really,  really did. And I paid into teacher retirement, which I still draw a check.  Teacher retirement, if you pay into it, you will   I can   t even remember  how much that I get, it   s not an astonishing amount, but any beats none.  And your boys all went to South Side school.  Yes.  How would they get to school in the morning?  Well, I had to go and if they were ready they could go.  Randy rode the  bus for twelve years. Barry and Danny rode with me until they were  sixteen and then they started driving the school bus. Terry also rode with  me.   I was thinking they drove the school bus.  Danny, it seems like Danny drove the school bus, didn   t he?  Maybe so.  Everybody liked our kids and they really liked Danny, he was always   I  never saw Danny when he looked like he was all ruffled up and angry  with the world. He just wasn   t turned that way.  How old was he when he had his accident in the summer?  It could   ve killed him.  25  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  What happened?  Well let   s see I was trying to think, he fell     He was climbing a tree.  Climbing in the tree, yes, and fell and a  fence post  went into his  stomach area.  What did you do?  Oh, listen I was terrified because Aubrey wasn   t there. Seems like we  had to go get Aubrey somewhere, he wasn   t there at the house. We  couldn   t hardly believe what we were seeing or what was happening, but  I knew we had to get Danny to the doctor. I don   t think we knew Dr.  Williams before that, I don   t think we did but we may have. But we got  him to the doctor and I   m telling you now, it was the worst thing that we  had ever been involved in. See when something goes into the cavity of  your body, you never know what organ it   s going to hit and what the  damage can be. It could   ve killed him just as easily.  But he stayed in the hospital for how long?  Well, quite a long time. I probably have it written down somewhere but I  just can   t remember. But you know we started out staying there with him  either in the hospital or in the area close by. It could   ve killed him  instantly is what it could   ve done.  But it didn   t.  But it didn   t. It was a narrow escape. But Danny was always kind of like  the   I hate to use the word daresome. It makes it sound like he was just  inviting trouble. But you know, boys will be boys and they just do things  sometimes that they shouldn   t do, oughtn   t to do or wouldn   t think about  it being dangerous.  Did you have any other catastrophes on the farm? Like a barn burning?  I was trying to think, it seems like we had something that burned. Do  you remember if we had a barn that burned?  I think so.  Thank the Lord we didn   t lose a child. My daddy fretted around that one  of those boys, we had four boys then, but my daddy just knew that one  of them would get in that lake   we had that big lake we were irrigating  26  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  out of   and that they would drown. Well you can just almost visualize  one of them being out there and couldn   t swim. So I spent the summer  taking them to Tipton to take swimming lessons and they all learned  how to swim, but I couldn   t swim and save myself, much less a child   What else do you remember growing up in that area?  Well, I really liked where we lived. I liked the house, I liked us having  the lake because the kids could not just swim in it, I didn   t want them to  be down there without some of us grown people   and I couldn   t swim.  Aubrey   s Uncle Doc, he was always giving advice. But it was for our  own good. I   m just so thankful that we all lived through everything that  we faced that could   ve been devastating.  How does the current day economic picture compare to the 1930s from  your experience? How are times different?  Well, see I was born in 1925. But I guess times were harder then or else  people did not how to use whatever it was that they had to make a living.  And we always had a good living. Aubrey was a dedicated daddy and he  was a dedicated farmer. I learned how to plow with the big tractors or  the little tractor, it didn   t matter.  Do you have any advice that you would give young people today about  the best way to make it through hard times?  Well, experience is supposed to be a good lesson. We weren   t dog  rolling rich at all, but we had a good life. We had a good family, our kids  were well-behaved. We didn   t put up with any cursing or a lot of things  that kids do anymore. They knew how to work. I think they still all  know how to work. And I don   t think that there   s any way that I would  change my life at all.  What would you say throughout your lifetime has been the greatest or  most significant invention? There have been a lot.  There   s been a lot  I was just fixing to say, there   s the washing machine  business. Now that was a great, great improvement. You know, used to  you just had to wash on a rub board or I can remember when we had  clothes setting out there. My mother and daddy had a big wash pot and  he   d build a fire on wash day around that wash pot to heat that water.  And then he had a paddle like thing that you could put under your sheets  and hold them up to drain the water out of them. We always had plenty  to eat, clothes to wear. I think for the times that we couldn   t have had  better for us. Now probably everybody wouldn   t say that for themselves,  but  we sure did .  27  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  L. Wilson  B. Wilson  Do you feel like you developed many frugal habits in the 1930s that  you   ve maintained throughout your life or passed on to your children?  Well I wish I could say, but I think one of the big things that   s probably  happening these days is to spend money that you don   t have to buy  something that you really don   t have to have.  On credit.  On credit. And it   s just pathetic because you can lose everything you  have if you do that. I mean people can move in and say,    Look, you owe  me so and so much money. I   ll just take your land here and then you can  do whatever you want to do.    We were thrifty in a, well I think in a  smart way. We didn   t blow money just to be spending money. I think  that Aubrey Wilson was the best daddy and husband that anybody  could   ve ever had. I loved him dearly and he was a gentleman always  and he was fun. Sometimes he seemed like he might not be fun, but he  was. He always was. He didn   t overdo it, but he didn   t under do it either.  (Laughs) But I think he was my hero.  Great. Well thank you for talking with me today and sharing some of  your memories.  (Laughs) Well any time, Tasha.  -------  -------
