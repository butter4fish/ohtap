 Tibbs, and I am in Pawnee, Oklahoma, at the home of  Ronald Rice Jr. I   m doing this for Native American Art Class and for  the Oklahoma State University Oral History Project. Can I get you to  tell us your name?  Rice Ronald James Rice Jr.  Tibbs Where you   re from?  Rice Pawnee, Oklahoma.  Tibbs What is your tribal background?  Rice Three-fourths Pawnee, a fourth Potawatomi, and a fourth Ioway.  Tibbs We   re here today to talk about the importance and the significance of  the drum, and how and why it is so very important and sacred to the  cultural continuity of Native Americans. The drum is also known as the  big drum, or in movies in Hollywood it is also called the War Dance  drum. I would just like to ask, what is the actual true meaning of the  drum or the essence of where it comes from?  Rice Growing up, we were told things about drum, and they reference to a  long time ago when we had to hunt for our food, and gather, things like  that. We were told that there was a prayer that went along with  everything. A lot of times, we needed animals for food and clothing and  then also a drum. That prayer, that   s a big part of it because we want  things to go good for us in the process. Try to apply that to today, the  process of making a drum, to incorporate prayers into our thoughts and  even during, before, and after the process.  5  Tibbs Why is the drum so important as far as coming from creation time up  until now? What has changed, and what hasn   t changed, as far as the  way we use the drum, the way our people see the drum?  Rice Today, it seems like there   s more powwows and, I   d say, contests  whereas in the past it was more ceremonial use. Our tribe, Pawnees, we  have visitation where our Wichita relatives that come up from down  south, they stay up here. That drum, it   s the focal point of our doings  and our ceremonies while they   re here. We have hand games, and  dances, and there   s all kinds of family songs. To me, there are still  things that go on like that and ceremonial dances, but there   s a lot more,  I   d say, where it   s not just one tribe. It   s a mix of all tribes at powwows.  It   s even real competitive today. There   s contests, singing contests, and  there   s big money in it, too, for our singers and stuff.  There is a big difference between what you   re going to be singing for  and what the drum is going to be actually used for. A lot of times it  could be used for all of that. That   s part of that prayer, that it   s going to  help or make someone feel good. That   s what it   s intended for, to lift  the spirits up. It   s got a good spirit in it. That   s what our folks told us.  When you get around it, we would refer to it like we were going to  church, try to dress that way, appropriately, around it.  We even referred to it as    Grandpa.    We called it Uppit in Pawnee.  That   s how we were supposed to treat it, real respectable around it, like  you was around your grandpa or an old man. You want to be gentle  with it, but at the same time you want to give it your all while you   re  around it because there   s that spirit in there. When you really get to  feeling that spirit, it can lift people up. Maybe there   s ones out there that  can   t dance or can   t get up, can   t move around. Maybe they want to be  out there, but that drum and the songs are going to lift them up. Then at  the same time, it   s going to make those dancers move. People are going  to see that, and it   s going to have, like, a ripple effect through the whole  area that surrounds it. That spirit inside it   s going to come alive.  Tibbs I would also like for you to talk about, like, the living spirit of the  animal hide in the wood and all things that have a spirit. Talk about the  belief and the wholeness and the oneness with all of creation that the  drum kind of represents.  Rice That   s basically what it is. It   s a spirit. Even though we may have taken  the animal   s life for the hide, we still believe it   s alive because of that  spirit that it has. Then it   s got the wood that   s inside of it that was a  living thing at one time, too. It has its own spirit. We believe that it   s  still alive and that if you take real good care of it, it   s going to take you  a lot of places. It   s going to take care of you. It   s going to keep you fed,  6  just take care of you. Take you to different places, places you never  believed you would be at. That   s how special that drum is and the spirit  in it. That   s how real it is. Sometimes you don   t know where it   s going  to take you in your life, but it   ll take you a lot of different places far  away from home, and meet different people, and make acquaintances  and friends. Learn a lot from it.  Tibbs I   d also like to ask you how did you got started making drums, or what  was your family influence? Did you have any relatives that also made  drums?  Rice Yeah, I had a couple different grandpas that made drums. I had some  uncles that made drums. What   s, I guess you would say, different about  the way I learned is that my folks had all gone on that did make drums,  so there wasn   t a lot of hands-on, I guess you could say, that they could  pass on to me, seeing and knowing what it   s all about and all into it. I  always just wanted to make one for our group and to do it myself. I  always thought it would be an awesome thing to do to construct one.  That   s what I set out to do was to try to make a drum. I kind of just had  to learn on my own, aside from the things I picked up from different  ones that had made a drum. I just kind of, I guess you might say, threw  myself into it, worked out the kinks as I learned. I kind of showed  myself. That   s how much belief I have in the drum growing up, and  what it   s done for me, and what I wanted to learn from it.  It took a couple tries, but after I   d gone through the trials and the errors,  it came out real nice. I learned a lot of patience and just different things  about it. Then, even going into prayer and asking God for help with the  structure of it, the designs, and having a calm attitude about it and a  good attitude, knowing that it would no doubt affect people   s lives later  on down the road. It wasn   t just that day or the next day, but maybe  years to come. That spirit can uplift people. Not only that, but maybe  my children might sit around it one day, too, and do the same thing for  their folks, or their tribe, or their relatives.  Tibbs What type of materials is usually incorporated in making a drum? What  can they usually be made from, as far as what kind of wood, what kind  of different hides can you use?  Rice Well, from what I   ve learned, you can use a lot of different materials.  You can use different animal hides, buffalo, cowhide, horsehide, I   ve  heard, elk, and deer. Just about any big game hide, I guess, that you can  skin and de-hair and stretch, you should be able to make a drum out of  it. Even the materials, I   ve heard of different ones using metal rings for  the cylinder. Some people use wood planks, kind of like an apple barrel.  Back in the day, they used to use apple barrels and tie drums around  7  them, or metal pots. Cut the bottom off and then tie the drum around it.  Nowadays, there   s all kinds of materials. I   ve seen a Plexiglas drum, a  clear one. It might have been a marching band bass drum or something  like that that they tied up. Yeah, you can just about use anything that   s  going to be a solid enough circular drum ring, and then any kind of  animal hide.  Tibbs What kind of material did you use on the last drum you actually tied?  Rice The last drum I made, I used a ring, a plywood ring and then slats, kind  of like the apple barrel concept but more up and down. We wrapped it  in a paneling and then stretched the hide around it. I guess there   s even  ways where they   ll soak a flat piece of wood, and then they   ll bend it in  a circle, and it will dry out so that it   s just one whole piece.  Tibbs How do you normally have to prepare the hide and the lace? What   s the  process as far as, say you get a hide and it has the hair on it, and you  want to get it ready to tie up a drum? What   s the process there you have  to go through in order to     Rice Well, if you don   t have to skin the animal and you just get the hide,  you   re going to more than likely get it with some of the remains on the  inside. You   re going to have to stretch it out and skin all the fat and  everything from the inside down to the skin. Skin it clean. Then, there   s  two different methods that I   ve heard of. The one I used was using lye  and water. You soak that hair, actually the whole thing. You soak it in  the lye and the water, and it takes a couple days. It loosens up the hair,  the lye does, and then the hair will come out, fall out. You have to  scrape it all out, too. From there, you just keep washing your raw hide  until it   s clean enough to work with. The other process of it they use (I  guess it   s an older method) is the charcoals. They use hot charcoals.  They   ll roll the hide in that, and I guess it takes the hair off. It takes it  out. No matter which way you go, there   s a lot of work in cleaning your  own hide and de-hairing it. It   s a lot harder than it looks, (Laughs) to  say the least. Then, dealing with the smell, the aroma, is a lot to deal  with, a lot to handle.  Tibbs Is there any type of special tools or anything that you use as far as  being able to cut the materials, or just a lot of time and patience?  Rice Yeah, that and a real good, sharp knife, a lot of premeditating as far as  measurements go because not all hides are the same. It   s not like you  have an outline to go by. You have to take your time. Then it   s real  flimsy. It   s all wet and slippery, so it   s kind of hard to work with. You  have to have a real sharp knife and a steady hand.  8  Tibbs As far as your tribe, since you   re Pawnee, how does your tribe usually  use the drum? Do you guys have different dances, or what kind of  ceremonies do you guys have?  Rice Yeah, I touched on it a little bit. We have our Wichita visitation, so the   inaudible  dance. We alternate. We   ll go down there one year, then the  next year, they   ll come up here and camp for a week. We play hand  game, and then we have a dance on the last day. The drum is a big part  of that. We have other ceremonies in our tribe that we use the drum for.  Not only that, but we have a real big celebration for our veterans here at  Pawnee. We   ve been having it for quite some years now. It   s the main  thing of that dance, is the drum. I heard someone say,    Without it, there  wouldn   t be no dance, no dancers.    It   s the heartbeat of our ceremonies  and our dances. It   s right in the center. That   s where it sits for us. It   s  the main piece. We also have tail dances over here in our round house  in Pawnee. It   s the same thing there. We treat it with respect. We even  feed our singers first. That   s part of how much we respect them for  coming to be around the drum. We know if it weren   t for the drum and  the singers, we wouldn   t be able to have no dances.  Tibbs I   d also like to ask you, how often do you make a drum? Do you usually  make one once a year? Do you usually make them in the springtime, or  when   s the best time to make a drum?  Rice Well, I   m sure there   s many different answers for that. Myself, I don   t  claim to know everything about making drums, even the reasons for  why people do or when they do. Myself, I   ve been told that a lot of  times they made drums in the wintertime because of the smell, dealing  with the raw flesh, that it was easier to work with it because it was cold  out, and that smell wouldn   t bother you so much. Nowadays, you can  acquire commercial hides, and there is no smell. You can make them in  the summertime or springtime, whenever. I would say it   s a good idea  to make a new one with maybe the start of a new season.  Also, sometimes I may not make a drum for a while. I   ll go maybe even  a year or two without making one, and then maybe one year make two  or three in the same month. It just varies. I guess need, demand.  Sometimes people are looking for drums. When you   re wanting one,  wanting to buy one, I guess, or wanting to get one on a kind of trade or  something. Then also, maybe you might need a new drum. Sometimes,  just like anything, they get old. Maybe you have to repair it or fix a new  one to use. Yeah, I don   t know. It just depends on the person, what  they   re making it for, and what they   re going to use it for, and when  they want to make it, or if they have help. If they   re going to be dealing  with the raw hide that has the guts on it, and the flesh on the inside, the  hair to deal with, or if they   re going to pick up a raw hide that   s already  9  been done, cleaned and ready to go. For me, there is no real, I guess you  would say, specific time of the year to make one. Whenever it comes up  or comes around and needs to be done.  Tibbs I   m Cheyenne and Southern Cheyenne, and our people say that the  drum can gather power from weather, kind of like a rainstorm in the  springtime. Sometimes they say that   s a good time to make something  like that as far as getting the animal hides, and the spirit that   s involved  that goes into them.  Rice Yeah, I would agree with that. To me, that sounds real logical. It   s  good, like a lot of things, start new in the springtime. For us as Native  Americans, it   s referred to as Indian New Year, springtime. To me, that  goes right along with it. It would be a new start, a fresh new beginning,  new prayers.  Tibbs Do you also think it   s very important   because I   ve seen other tribes  have some classes on drum-making. It was considered a lost art there  for a little while a few years back. Now it seems kind of like a cultural  renaissance, so to speak, as far as a lot of Native Americans are getting  more involved in their culture. It seems like there   s not as many drum  makers. I   m not saying it   s a lost art, but do you think that, as well, as  far as knowing very many people that also tie up drums?  Rice I   d say a few years back, maybe I would agree with you there. All that I  knew of was just a few people that made drums and maybe went about  it the way that they did, and had their procedures and whatever they did  that went into it. Nowadays, I think there   s more and more drum makers  out there. I am not 100 percent, but with the technology, it seems to be  getting commercialized a lot. There   s a lot of different internet places  you can buy a drum. To me, it   s different. You can just go on there and  buy a drum just like you were shopping at the store or something,  whereas when we were younger, we knew somebody that made them.     We   ll go down and see Grandpa and see if we can get a drum for our  little drum group,    when we were younger. Nowadays, it   s just a mouse  click on the internet, and you can have one on its way in the mail. To  me, it   s a lot different than it was. That was the idea I had was I wanted  to make my own. I didn   t want to have to buy it from somebody or  order it online, so to speak. I wanted to have my thoughts and feelings  in it. To me, it   s more commercialized nowadays. I think there   s more  drum makers out there. Just don   t know of them. I   m sure that they   re  making drums and doing it their own way.  I think it   s important to keep making them, even though, like I was  saying, it   s commercialized, and it   s on the internet. Myself, I   ve got  boys. I know that they see it, and we talk about it and what goes into it.  10  I was even explaining to them about this video we were going to do  about drum making and stuff. Their little minds understood it a little bit,  about the prayers that go into it and then how important it is to our tribe  for our dances. I think it   s real important to show that to them so they  can be able to pick it up, and be able to learn something and pass it on,  and preserve it within our own families and our own tribes, our own  culture, so they don   t have to get on the internet or ask somebody for a  drum. They will be able to make their own drum and maybe even help  out their friends and relatives down the road. Their kids, pass it on, keep  it going, keep it alive for us. That   s what I   m hoping for, why I invested  my time in it.  Tibbs That kind of brings us full circle back to what I was talking about: the  importance and significance of the drum, why it is important and how it  is used in almost every ceremony, everything we do as Native  Americans, and how our cultural continuity, how we had to learn how  to kind of keep things going. Do you ever have people that ask you to  make a drum for them or anything like that?  Rice Yeah, I did in the past. Sometimes things, they just don   t work out  where it   s feasible, or just don   t get around to it, or they don   t get the  material, or one or the other. Not lately, I haven   t made any drums for  anyone lately.  Tibbs Do you think that in these modern times, a lot of times people want to  take the easy route as far as getting a little bit lazy and not wanting to  actually take the time, like you said, to get the material and put the time  and effort in to learn how to make one? I know it takes time, and some  people don   t want to take that amount of time to make one.  Rice Yeah. I can   t say anyone in particular, but I could see that. The  generations today, it may seem a lot easier and quicker just to buy one  or get a hold of one somewhere, and get around it and sing. I think if a  person wants to make their own drum or even all the group members  help make a drum, there   s a different feeling that goes along with it,  more of a connection with that particular drum and those particular  people with the songs they   re going to sing. We were talking about the  prayer and then the thought that goes into it, being thankful for it and  what it   s going to do for them in the future. I could see a person  wanting to take, like we were saying, the easy route out, and being a  quicker process of just getting a drum and singing. To me, the person  that   s going to take the time and effort to construct one or put their  emotions and feelings into it and then their prayers, the spirit might be  there for them a little bit more because of the connection they had with  it. Being around it and singing, to me, it   s like a machine when  everyone   s in sync and all the sticks are together on that drum. To me, it  11  unlocks a spirit in that drum. It   s all a connection with the singers, and  the drum, and the songs, the feelings they have, the spirit, and emotions  they   ve got in their songs, and the feelings in their music.  Tibbs After you make a drum, do you get a feeling of accomplishment, like sit  back and look at what you   ve made? How does that make you feel as  far as a artist creating something?  Rice Yeah, to me, it   s a real good feeling, a real great feeling. A wonderful  feeling, I guess you would say. When you look back, I guess, and you  just see the raw material there, you have to visualize it like an artist  would. The end process, you have a product that you   ve created. That   s  a sense of full circle, a spiritual feeling. That   s something that could  come to life out of materials. It   s a real good feeling. I   d say even a  little bit more on top of that, when you get to sit around it and sing, you  get that feeling of that spirit that   s in that drum. That   s, I would say, the  pinnacle of it.  Tibbs Do you guys have any belief as far as the sound the drum makes as far  as relating it to thunder, the thunder spirits, or anything along those  lines?  Rice Yeah, I   ve heard some older folks refer to it like rolling thunder. I   ve  heard them talk about it. That deep bass that it has, it moves you, just  like the weather would or spirits.  Tibbs I was wanting to ask you about how the power of the spirit that comes  out, and the power that it has, it   s been known to heal people. Have you  ever witnessed that or heard stories about that, how the drum can  actually heal people that hears it, or rather, maybe they touch it and  bless themselves?  Rice I   ve heard a lot of different stories. I haven   t got to see it, but I   ve heard  different ones come up and tell us that it lifted them up, made them feel  good, made them have a better day than when they came to the dance,  or came around the drum. I   ve heard stories of people that couldn   t  walk, get up and dance and walk because of that drum. I personally  haven   t seen that. I believe in it, though. It can lift someone up and  make them feel better. It   s got that living spirit in it to do that.  Tibbs Being Native American, do you feel that the drum is always going to be  kind of placed up on a pedestal as far as always going to be there for  the people to use, and we   re always going to have a lot of respect for it?  Do you think that it   s always going to be that way, that we have to keep  it at the forefront of our ceremonies and our traditions as far as the  continuity of our people?  12  Rice Yeah, I think it plays a major role in our perseverance as Native  Americans and keeping our culture alive. I   m going to say that with all  things, there   s going to be change that we can   t foresee, that our  grandparents and great-grandparents couldn   t foresee. We definitely  don   t do how they did, but we try our best to follow their footsteps. I  believe it   s going to be that same way with our generations after us, our  grandkids and our children. They   re not going to be able to do exactly  like us, but they   re going to try their best.  I do believe there   s going to be change with it. It   s just a matter of  trying to preserve the way we see it and the respect we have for it, so  they can understand that and keep it as close as they can to viewing it  like going to church, sitting around that drum and respecting it like our  grandpa. I do believe that, no matter what, all things are going to  change. Something we can   t   it   s just out of our hands. We might not  be around to see it, but maybe our kids will, grandkids.  Tibbs As far as making drums, do you consider it   have you ever actually  called it an art, as far as like an art form. You know how to make them,  but do you consider it an art form, or more or less just a tradition, a  family tradition that   s been passed down that you   re trying to  perpetuate and propel, allow your kids and children to see it as far as a  cultural experience?  Rice I believe it can be both. It can be a piece of art, and then at the same  time, it   s a functional piece of art, a traditional, functional piece of art  that we are trying to preserve.  Tibbs Have you ever seen them used in other areas than say at a ceremony, or  powwow, or dance?  Rice Yeah, I   ve seen non-Native Americans use them as tables, coffee tables,  or end tables, or pieces of furniture, basically. Some of them put them  in cases or hang them on walls, more or less just to display. I believe  that they   re art but functional pieces of art. To me, if they   re going to be  what you would call a spiritual drum to us as Native Americans, if it   s  going to have a spirit, then it   s going to have to be used. We, to me,  don   t make a drum to hang on the wall. We don   t make one to set our  coffee on it. That   s not its purpose. It might be art, and it might be  something beautiful to someone without the understanding of it, but to  us, there   s a lot more to it than just putting it on display. It   s alive. Your  grandpa, he don   t want to be put up on a shelf. Way back to our folks,  they wouldn   t just use it for something to put on display. It had a  purpose.  13  Tibbs I guess I   d like to ask, maybe, for you to describe the process as far as  cutting the hide, or lacing one up. How does that work, as far as the  process goes of actually tying one? What   s that process?  Rice Well, it wouldn   t matter what kind of hides you   ve got once you get to  your rawhide point where you   re going to have to soak it in water. It   s  going to get pliable to use because it   s going to start stretching and get  saturated with water. Then you   re going to want to start cutting it out.  What I use was like a pattern, maybe a sheet or cloth or something to  lay over the drum to get an idea of how big you wanted your covers to  be. Then lay it out, and kind of just trace it out, and cut your circles out  of your two pieces. A lot of times, to me, the trickiest part is sometimes  we don   t get enough hide. We just get barely enough, so the hard part is  getting the lace out of what   s left, having to work your way around that.  Once you get all your hides cut out, your circles, and your lace, then  you need to put some holes in it.  Some people, they cut notches with knives. Some people use drill bits  and drill circles in it. Then there   s hole punches you can use, too,  leather hole punches. Then, once you get your holes and your lace  ready, then you just lace it up. There   s a lot of different ways people  lace their drums. Some use a single lace, and some crisscross it or  double it. It just depends on the person. To me, that is where it becomes  more of art, I guess. For a drum maker, you   re going to see different  drums and you   ll say,    Wow, this person makes it like that. This person  makes it kind of similar to how I make them.    There   s even different  shapes, different widths, all around different ideas of how they make a  drum. Then it   s starting to become your own art because you   re going  to stand out one way or another based on how you make your drums,  and how you tie them, or how they sound. People are going to like one  more than the other.  Tibbs Do different animal hides and different woods make for a different  sound, a different tone?  Rice I would say it definitely does. You   re going to have thicker hides and  thinner hides. People are going to tie them tighter and looser. The  tighter, the higher pitch; the thinner, the higher the pitch. You   re going  to have thicker hides and maybe tie them not as tight. They   re going to  have deeper pitches, and it   s going to resonate and vibrate through the  wood that   s on the inside, depending on what kind of wood it is,  whether or not it   s going to absorb the vibrations, or if it   s going to be  like a baffle, I guess. Some people even have an air pocket for it to  come out. Just depends on the drum maker, I guess, and what he   s  looking for.  14  Tibbs Once you get a drum tied, and you said the hide was wet, how long do  you have to wait before the drum is ready to be used?  Rice Just depends on dry time. If it   s middle of the summer or springtime,  you can put it outside, and the sun   s going to dry it pretty quick. I   d say  you can have a drum dried out, depending on how thick the hide is, in  one day, depending on if the sun was out all day. With colder  conditions, it   s going to take longer. You may not have the luxury of the  sun. You may have to dry it with another process, heaters, or lights, or  woodstove, or a stove.  Tibbs Once it   s dried, can you reheat them in order to get that better sound or  higher pitch sound? How does that work?  Rice Yeah, just about with any drum, it   s going to loosen or tighten up  depending on humidity and the climate, matter of fact, wherever you are  located. We   ve gone out west in the dry heat, and they stretch really  tight and even crack the hide sometimes because it   s so dry out there.  You have to wet it down. That   s part of taking care of that hide. I   ve  heard some people use grease on them to keep that oil in there. Some  people use a wet rag with water. We   ve heard our folks refer to it as  giving them a drink, giving Grandpa a drink, taking care of it. That   s  what they   re talking about: taking care of it.  Up in Canada, it   s cold up there and damp. It kind of loosens it up. The  drum is real flimsy and loose. It changes the whole tone, and then we   ll  have to use some kind of heat to tighten it up. We put it by a fire,  campfires, and it   s tightened up. They had a blow dryer one time that  we used to tighten it up. Just different ways. No doubt, heat   s going to  always tighten your skin up. The cool weather and damp areas are going  to loosen it up on you. You don   t want too much heat because it   s going  to crack and stretch it too much.  Tibbs When you travel around and see different drums around the country, is  there kind of like a set price, or do you see people selling them, or is  there a market for them that you   ve seen?  Rice Yeah, I think there   s a market for them. It   s maybe a market you have  to go find sometimes. If you have a way for them to find you, people  are going to find you. I think there   s a market, maybe not a real big  market because there   s a lot of different drums being made out there. A  lot of times you   ll see different drum makers selling them at powwows.  A lot of people are starting groups up and looking for drums, wanting to  drum or maybe wanting to sing with their families or their kids, which I  think is good. It   s always good to pass down our traditional ways.  15  Tibbs Have you ever been asked by a school or college or anyone to come in  and give any demonstrations on how to tie a drum, or talk to some  school kids, or anything like that?  Rice Yeah, one time we were asked to go up to Lawrence, Kansas, at the  Haskell Indian Nations University. We did a demonstration on drums,  talking about tying them, and went into them and the process, and then  elaborated a little bit on etiquette of being around the drum. Shared  some songs with them, also. I   ve done little demonstrations for kids     schools around different areas.  Tibbs Explain drum making, and its relevance to the history of Native  American art.  Rice I think drum making has real important relevance in art history. I just  don   t believe for it being the most important thing and being what all  our ceremonies and dances are centered around, that it   s been recorded.  It hasn   t really been recorded that I know of. There hasn   t been many  drum makers that have been noted, I guess, or put down in books and  history. At the same time, maybe there   s a reason for that. Maybe they  didn   t want it commercialized. Even though, to me, it might already be  there, and we   re kind of headed in that direction. A lot of people are out  there making drums and selling them for the profit.  Maybe that   s why the drum makers in the past, they might have sold  them, but it wasn   t all about the profit. It was more about the spirit, and  the passing on of singing, and encouraging younger singers. I had an  uncle tell me when he was learning to sing, there wasn   t a lot of young  people around the drum. It was mostly older people. I see it being  maybe some of those drum makers from then, they didn   t want it  commercialized or maybe they didn   t want to get it down in a recording  or publicize it too much because they were trying to pass on something  more traditional and spiritual. I believe that it   s a real important  functional piece of art today. It   s a living spirit. It   s real powerful,  according to our culture, our people. I believe it has a real importance in  art history, it just hasn   t been documented that I know of. Like I said,  maybe there   s reasons for that, or perhaps it   s time it gets documented.  Tibbs Do you feel that Native Americans in general sometimes don   t like the  fact that things are commercialized, or that they   re kind of stolen in the  way that some people try to copy our ways?  Rice I believe there   s more, I guess you would say, traditional Native  Americans that live with more of their cultural upbringing that feel like  it   s better off keeping it within their family or to themselves, or hanging  onto it so that it doesn   t get to a commercialized perspective, or just that  16  everybody has a drum, or maybe even not respecting it the way that  they were taught. Passing the drum on has to have that respect that goes  with it. Yeah, I do believe, with that in mind, there are different Native  Americans that want to keep it to themselves and not share too much of  it. Along with those thoughts, too, say that they didn   t share it with  anyone and they passed on. Then you   ve got a situation where maybe  their art form didn   t get passed on to their next generation because they  were so tight with it. I guess it can work both ways.  -------  -------
