 Little Thunder  Henry  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, February 10,  2012. I am at Oklahoma City University at the home of Robert Henry,  currently President and CEO of OCU. Robert, you   ve had a  distinguished career as an attorney, as the Attorney General of the State  of Oklahoma, Chief Justice of the US Court of Appeals, but Native  artists in Oklahoma know you as an articulate advocate for and  supporter of Native art and as a collector. That   s the focus of our  interview here. Thank you for taking time to speak with me today.  It   s my pleasure.  Your father was also an attorney and state district judge, I read, and  your parents met in college. As a child, what were some of your earliest  experiences with art?  My father loved art, and I remember one of the first pieces of Native  American art that I saw him acquire or brag about was a Tony Ponkilla  carving of Will Rogers. It   s actually here in my library. Tony was  Seminole. He took an old orange crate and did this amazing bas-relief of  Will Rogers who was, of course, both Indian and cowboy, a member of  the Cherokee tribe. That was one of  the first pieces of Indian art I  recall .  We also had, in my bedroom, a Woody Big Bow. Woody Big Bow was  one of the Kiowa painters, a ery enthusiastic painter. Sometimes he  painted the same thing a little bit too much. (Laughter) I think I sort of  developed my love for the Kiowa style from that. Then I became  acquainted with Scott Momaday many years later and developed more  love for the Kiowa tribe and its amazing culture. I guess per capita it   s  probably the most artistic tribe. Growing up as I did around Shawnee,  there were Seminole,  Pottawatomi , Shawnee, and Creek painters. I saw  their work from early times.  5  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Were you, yourself, interested in drawing or painting at all?  I am the most incapable artist that ever lived. People see I have a pretty  extensive collection, mostly Native American, Western, some classical  figures, lithographs, and they just assume that I must be able to do  something artistically. I cannot draw a stick figure in a compelling way.  (Laughter) I am totally artistically challenged, but that   s good for art  because I   m no threat to anyone and I buy a lot of paintings. (Laughter)  You were exposed to Native art as a child. Were you exposed to the  culture at all, growing up in Shawnee?  Not so much. A little bit from Boy Scouts and a little bit from visiting a  powwow or two. Actually, it was when I was in the Oklahoma  legislature. I was elected to the legislature when I was twenty-three, and  I began to study our Indian heritage more. Initially, I didn   t understand  sovereignty and was confused by it and thought it was  counterproductive. The more I got into it, I began to understand the logic  of it, the legality of it, and also the blessings that it provides.  Tribal wisdom is really great wisdom. It   s sort of getting the world down  to its least common denominator. The great Abrahamic works of faith  are all tribal: the Torah, the Koran, the Jewish scriptures, and the early  Christian scriptures. Now, the early Christian scriptures are not so tribal,  but they have the tribal wisdom of the Jewish fathers behind them.  Tribal societies engage life on its simplest terms and have been able to  develop some incredible wisdom. They are communitarian. They   re  altruistic. They   re not individualistic. We have enough individualism, I  think, in America today. We need a little bit more communitarianism,  altruism, helping the group.  When did you purchase your first painting by a Native artist?  Gosh, it would   ve been, I think, when I was in college. Then,  subsequently, my father passed away, and when my mother sold our  house, by mistake that Big Bow painting that I grew up with got away  from me, got away from us. I was just horrified by that. I was sure it was  packed away somewhere. Many years later, I was in the old farmers  market down here in Oklahoma City that used to have some people that  would go out to garage sales and find something. I turned the corner and  I saw my painting, the one I grew up with, the one that was right over  the television set in my bedroom. I asked the shopkeeper, I said,    Where  did you get that painting?    He said,    I bought it at a garage sale in  Shawnee.    So I bought my painting back. It   s really a great Woody Big  6  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Bow. Some of his are not as good, but this is a really great one. It   s in  my office now, so I see it every day.  That   s a wonderful story. As a student, you probably didn   t have a lot of  extra money. Was it a little bit of a sacrifice?  Yes.  Do you remember what that picture was?  No, I don   t. I think it   s a time honored thing in collecting Indian art. You  go to garage sales, and you go to antique shops, and you bargain and  trade and so forth. I think it was probably when I was Attorney General I  learned about the  Colonel Thomas  McKenney and  James  Hall  lithographs that are not Indian paintings but paintings of Indians, which  is a remarkable historical record. Thank God, Colonel McKenney liked  Indians. He was fired from being Indian Commissioner by Andrew  Jackson because he did like Indians.  You can make a pretty compelling case that the Indian Commissioner  ought to like Indians, but Jackson was a traitor. Indian people helped  him all through his career, and his good friend Sam Houston was  adopted in the Cherokee tribe, but Jackson was a total political  opportunist. What he did to our Indian people is tragic. It   s in many  senses the Indian holocaust. The Trail of Tears was a creation of his  perfidy. It is a black, black spot on America.  Thankfully, Colonel McKenney had Charles Bird King and others paint  these great Indians, and then even though Jackson forbade him to, he  made lithographs of them which were then hand-colored and distributed  between, I think, about 1825 and 1845. So we have these remarkable  collections of what the great Indians looked like when they went to  Washington, what Sequoyah, who represented the Western Cherokees,  looked like when he went there. He did have that turban. He did have  that colorful clothing. He did smoke a little pipe. He did have the silver  medal the Cherokees gave him for creating the syllabary. Or  how   Chief  William  McIntosh, who was part Scottish,  looked and dressed .  He wore a tartan with his Scottish sword and a big Indian feather. Or  Pushmataha, who wore a blue military jacket he   d been given for bailing  somebody out from time to time.  I bought a lot. I collected over the years a lot of those. Later, I fell under  the spell of Doris Littrell. Just going to visit her at the Oklahoma Indian  Art Gallery was just amazing. You kind of wanted to turn her on and just  let her talk. She knows more about Indian art than anyone, I think, in  history. I bought many things from her. She would let me pay things out,  7  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  and she really, really helped me.  Was that the first Indian art gallery that you started frequenting?  Yes, I bought things from antique shops and so forth, but she was the  first. Then there were a couple in Santa Fe that I worked with quite a bit,  but no one knew as much as Doris, particularly about Plains Indians but  really just about everything, about basketry, about jewelry, about  German silver, those sorts of things.  When you were visiting with Doris and buying a bit in Santa Fe, were  you conscious of collecting particular styles of work or a particular  subject matter?  No, I initially started with Oklahomans, and when we bought a little  casita in Santa Fe, well, I wanted to get some of the New Mexicans.  Then I found that there were these great friendships. Woody Crumbo  went to Santa Fe all the time. Quincy Tahoma and Harrison Begay and  Beatien Yazz would interact with the locals here.  Of course, we had the amazing school of Indian art in Santa Fe where  Ben Harjo studied and Sherman Chaddlesone, and  T.C. Cannon  was  there. There was such a milieu, and they traded with each other. And the  great Allan Houser, who was born at Fort Sill in the short grass country  of Oklahoma, kinsman of Geronimo, relocated to Santa Fe. I remember  seeing he started as a painter, and I remember seeing this first marble  sculpture he did for some event. It was just fantastic because then all of a  sudden he started sculpting, and he changed sculpting, I think. He just  created a style.  I just collected the ones I really loved. Jerome Tiger got very expensive,  and I wanted a really good Jerome Tiger. It took me a long time, and I  finally got one. There   s a few of the really beginning artists that I don   t  have that I   d like to have. Ernest Spybuck, I   d like to have. I have a  wonderful Carl Sweezy. I love those folks upon whose shoulders   modern Indian artists  stand. I   d love to have a Lois Smoky, the Kiowa  five you always hear about. Well, there were six. Her work is  astoundingly difficult to find.  Was your wife always on board with that? Sometimes it   s something you  have to negotiate unless you   re both     My wife was always on board in the jewelry category. (Laughter)  Anything involving Indian jewelry she was all for. I think the painters  were an acquired taste with her. I think she pretty much shares my  passion now for painters.  8  Little Thunder  Henry  I suspect her favorite is Ben Harjo. She loves Ben Harjo. We   ve just  been close friends for a long time. She loves really intricate work. She  loves Merlin Little Thunder   s work because she is a dentist and she   s  very precise. Actually, she made my wedding ring. She knows how to do  these things, and she can really value that precision. It takes a little more  than precision, but precision is kind of nice, too.  Do you think collecting is primarily an emotional impulse, or is it an  intellectual kind of experience, or is it both?  I guess it   s both. I remember seeing a painting once that was not Indian,  but it was very much an Indian subject. It was a Benedictine priest in the  Northeast who painted scriptural scenes with various Indian tribes,  Indians from Guatemala, Navajos, Plains Indians. I remember he did a  transfiguration with a Crow and a Sioux and a Blackfoot. It   s Jesus and  Elijah and Moses.  I was looking at his work, and I turned the corner, and I saw this little  Navajo boy in this painting, very big eyes, sad eyes, beautiful Navajo  features with a little lamb over his shoulder, and it was the Good  Shepherd. It was the shepherd who leaves the flock to save the lost  sheep. I turned and saw it, and my breath just went out of me.  I just sat there, and I said,    Jan, Jan, come look at this.    We looked at it  because it was telling a universal truth, and a truth that is so much  Native in origin, too. Indian wisdom would completely understand that. I  said,    I hope that painting is sold because it doesn   t matter what the  price is, I   m going to buy it.    (Laughter) It was sold. I bought a copy of  it, which isn   t the same, but sometimes you will see a painting that does  that to you.  I have a Harvey Pratt painting that   s very much the other way. I love  Harvey   s work. I saw a painting across his booth span at Red Earth one  time, and I thought,    Well, that   s really interesting. I   ll go over and look  at it.    When you get close, you just start laughing because you begin to  see that it   s a series of Indian warriors who had a very long ride, and  they have stopped to relieve themselves, all of them. And the horses are  doing the same thing. (Laughter)  You just sit there   it has this whimsy that many great Indian painters  like to do. Sometimes you laugh in order to keep from crying. I   m just  sitting there chuckling, and Harvey comes over, and I said,    Harvey, I  love that painting  Where would you hang it?    He said,    In the  bathroom.    I said,    Sold     (Laughter) I bought it instantly.  9  Little Thunder  Henry  So that was a very different kind of emotional   because sometimes, you  just want to laugh. I used to have that painting in my old house in  Heritage Hills. It was so funny because people would come out of the  little guest room. Many wouldn   t notice it, but those that did would  always    (Laughter)  I have a Ben Harjo wood block that tells an amazing story from the  annals of Cheyenne law. The Cheyenne, like all tribes, were opposed to  the death penalty. There was war, but tribes didn   t do the death penalty.  They did restorative justice. The tribe needed every able person. If a  person committed a murder, they might be sent away from the tribe for  some time. They might be banished, but none of the tribes really had  death penalties. They still don   t. I don   t know of an Indian tribe that has  the death penalty.  Ben tells in this wood block this amazing story of a Cheyenne warrior  who was killed, and his friends    spoil for revenge.    It   s translated. There  was a stench, they were so angry. The peace chief said,    Please do not  kill the murderer. We   ll take care of that. Here are some horses. Take  these horses that will make you whole. Leave the law to us.    They said,     Oh, no, no. We   re going to kill him. We   re going to kill him.     Then the murdered man   s father comes to them and says,    Haven   t I had  enough pain? Will you dishonor my name more by perpetrating another  murder of that for my son?    He said,    Would you please take my  horses? Take those, but please do not put me through more pain.    Then  the young warriors are ashamed, and they say,    We   re not going to  murder Sharp Nose   s murderer.    Sharp Nose was the one who was  murdered.    We   re not going to take your horses. We will take the chief   s  horses, but we   ll make them community property so that anybody that  needs them can use them.    Ben manages to tell this in a single wood  block. It   s one of my favorite pieces.  Sounds wonderful. As a collector, what is the difference between the  experience of being at a show in a gallery and being at a booth show?  Well, in booths, you almost always get to meet the artist. That   s really  interesting. Some artists are quite sullen. Most are not. Most are really  interested in their customers. Early on, I used to always go to all the  Indian markets at Santa Fe. It   s gotten so big and difficult now that I  tend to miss it a lot. If I know certain people are there, I   ll try to run and  see them. I like to look at the award winners to see what new directions  are going.  If you have a great gallery, as Doris   s was, that   s a great experience.  That   s a different experience. That   s an experience where you can take  10  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  an afternoon if you want. You don   t feel this pressure. When it   s  someone like Doris, it   s going to be an afternoon that   s well spent  because whatever she says, you need to know anyway.  What percentage of your collection, then, do you think is Oklahoma-based  or Native artists with Oklahoma ties?  I would say probably in excess of 50 percent. I   m not sure that it would  be two thirds, but it might be two thirds. It   s pretty much Oklahoma and  New Mexico. I have a Canadian carving or two, and I can   t remember  the famous prints. The name won   t come to me. I   m always interested in  different areas of the country, but I   m pretty much stuck here because I  have limited means, and you can make a more coherent collection.  I think it   s so interesting that the Northwest tribes, for example, they  have a geometry that is completely different from how Plains Indians see  things. The same, I think, for the Eastern tribes, not geometrical, but the  art is very different. Then you see the sort of modern fusion artists that  have gone new directions. Some of them, you can see they   ve adopted  some of the geometry of the Northwest tribes.  It seems to me that one thing Indian artists always got right was color,  and  Oscar  Jacobson said that. Even though the colors were sometimes  provided to them, they liked color, and they did things with color that I  think were shocking to some of the art establishment. Maybe everything  was kind of impressionistic and soft, and then all of a sudden you see  this flat style.  Stephen  Mopope   s reds and blues, and the other Kiowas,  and the pochoir series that the Germans loved, brown paper, but these  nice colors and this very flat, very primitive, but something new and  something different.  Are you collecting younger Native artists, too, in their twenties and  thirties?  I have tended to go more with the patriarchs and matriarchs. Isaac  Newton once said that if he saw more than anyone else, it was because  he stood on the shoulders of giants. I   m very interested in those giants  that modern artists stand on their shoulders. So many of them really had  a very tough life. They had illness problems, alcoholism problems,  diabetes. The federal Indian policies could not have been more  destructive if they   d tried. If they   d said,    Let   s really mess Indian life  up,    they would have never been as effective as these nutty on-again,  off-again policies and trying to blend the cultures instead of learning  from the cultures.  If you were to describe the focus of your collection, part of your interest  11  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  is getting an overarching historical and cultural  context ?  Right.  But  I  also  like to see the new directions. Think about literature  for a minute. I prefer Scott Momaday to Sherman Alexie, but Sherman  Alexie is a hoot, and he   s also Indian. He   s very Indian. He takes it a  new and different way, and I think he acknowledges Momaday. He  acknowledges those forces that they stand.  Scott Momaday is quite capable of pushing the envelope. Every now and  then, he goes off in a different way, but he is primarily a storyteller. That  is what Indian artists do.  They tell  a story. Tribal people know how to  tell stories. The Iliad is a tribal book. The Epic of Gilgamesh is a tribal  book, in a sense. The Torah is a tribal book. People know how to tell  stories, and Indian art really excels at that.  When you were Attorney General for the State of Oklahoma, did you  often bring your artwork into the Capitol? I don   t know how much  Native art was at the Capitol to start with.  I fell early on under the tutelage of Betty Price. I became quite the  advocate for things Indian in the Capitol. The thing I   m most proud of in  my ten years in the legislature is not a piece of Indian art, but in a sense  it is. I was the moving force behind getting Angie Debo   s portrait  painted by Charles Banks Wilson, who is not Indian but is one of the  leading supporters and believers of Indian art and has done more with  his pencil and the purebloods. Angie Debo is the person who spoke truth  to power first. She, more than any other person I know, with very few  resources, advocated for Indians, for tribal rights.  She never got a job at her alma mater, the University of Oklahoma,  because she just kept naming the names of corrupt people who had  abused Indians. She was made an honorary member of several tribes.  Particularly the Muscogee Creek really venerate her, but all tribal people  should. I have supported and worked on art in the Capitol for a long  time. My most recent project is a portrait of John Hope Franklin, who  has Indian blood, the African American historian. I have a study from  Ray Kinstler here in my office and my study here at home. February 22,  that will be hung. So, again, it is not by an Indian, but it is of an Indian.  You   ve mentioned that in the process of collecting, you   ve developed  friendships with artists and spent time with them in other settings and  contexts. How does that enrich your life and enrich your appreciation  for art?  Well, Indians are different just like everybody else. The Indian artists  that I either become friends with or acquaintances of are  often  laconic.  12  Little Thunder  Henry  They   re very terse. They don   t say a lot. What they do say is right on  point. Then, of course, there   s my dear friend Scott Momaday, who is  about as vocal as they come. And, again, everything he says is worth  hearing. When he talks about the Kiowas learning Christian hymns and  converting them to Kiowa, and he tells about it, you can hear that story. I  remember he took me through the cemetery near the Kiowa Baptist  Church near Rainy Mountain, the sacred Kiowa place. To have him  show me these tombstones and talk about people that I had heard of...  One of the things that people who don   t know about Indians are  surprised is how patriotic Indians are. Despite all the nasty stuff that has  been done to them, America is their country. Indians always volunteer in  greater numbers than average and are decorated in greater numbers than  average. When I became Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit and when I  became president of OCU, I had the Kiowa Black Leggings  Warrior   Society out here carrying those flags in. I remember when Justice   Sandra Day  O   Connor and I went to visit the Cherokees, every event  we had, there was a color guard, there was prayer, there was singing.  People don   t know these things about tribal people, and it   s good to  know them.  When my dear friend Wilma Mankiller died, she had asked me to speak  at her funeral. Her funeral was outside, and it was an amazing service. It  was a long service. We needed it to be a long service. It was outside in  sort of an arbor where the speakers were and open chairs. At the very  end of the service, a single, solitary red-tail hawk came out and made  circles right over the arbor. That hawk obviously wasn   t hunting. There  are not going to be any rodents. They   ve all been scared away by these  people. But people that spend a lot of time, the very spiritual Indian  people will say,    Oh, that   s the hawk. We expected him here today.     You mentioned that you acquired another residence in Santa Fe. Did  you take artwork from here to there, and how did you choose what you  took, or did you just embark on a new collecting adventure? (Laughs)  It   s gone back and forth. Initially, I got to meet Beatien Yazz, the great  Navajo painter. Spin a Silver Dollar is his book. Again, he is laconic,  very taciturn. I love his work. I have a little burrow of his in the snow. It  should be in Santa Fe where there are burrows that get in the snow, but it  just is so sweet and so beautiful and so lovely that that one had to come  back here and stay. I have some Ben Harjo there, but Quincy Tahoma  stays there. T. C. Canon, who could go either place, but my two T. C.  Canon pieces stay there. I have a Houser here and a Houser there. But  mostly, the Santa Fe pieces are New Mexican and mostly, here, the  pieces are Oklahoma.  13  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  You have this practice of having wonderful parties out there in Santa Fe,  which the artists come to and your friends come to, as well.  We used to always have an Indian Market party. One of the reasons we  did that is it was so much work for the artists. It   s expensive, you know,  so we thought if we just made this huge buffet where people could come  and not have to worry about trying to find a restaurant, which is all  going to be full, and it   s all going to be expensive, we could give  everybody one night where they can just come in and have a blast.  It would be interesting because Scott Momaday would often come, and  Paul Pletka would often come, and Ben Harjo would often come. You  have been. People would say,    Oh, there   s Pletka  Oh, there   s Mrs.  Houser     (Laughter) People would go and talk and chat, and Jean Seth  and Laurel Seth, the legendary gallery owners there, used to come.  Finally, life got so complicated, the last year we were just not able to do  it. It   s a big, big project, and we found that if we did that, we couldn   t go  to Indian Market. (Laughter) We   re trying to get enough energy to start  it up again.  It very much felt like, to the artists, a nice giving-back.  Yes. Nathan Hart would come. Chief  Lawrence  Hart, his father, is one  of my favorite figures in Oklahoma history.  What has been the best piece of advice or a tip that you   ve ever gotten  about collecting?  I think it   s probably that you should collect what you love and not  collect as an investment, and that if you see something that you really  love and the price is a little bit higher than it should be but if you really  love it, go through a mental list of what you can give up for a few  months to get it. (Laughter) I think you should get it.  I missed an Al Momaday the other day. Budget was a little tight that  month, and I thought I could wait a couple of days to the next month.  Went back, and it was gone. I   m really sorry about that because really  great art is something that holds its value in the sense that you love it for  as long as you can see it. I have over five thousand books in my library,  now. I have hundreds of paintings. There will be a time when I have to  size down, but a lot of these paintings will go with me to the rest home.  (Laughter)  Are there certain places that you go in the house at certain times of day  when you have the time when you   re at home to be around those  particular pieces?  14  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  We have a guest room here that we have a lot of visitors in, and it   s very  Native American. I love to just go in there and sit. The cats do, too, for  some reason. (Laughter) Also, in my den I have three of my very  favorite paintings hung together. I like to go in there.  I like the sculpture, too. Some of my sculptures are not by Indian artists,  but they   re of Indian subjects. Those are fun to be with. People enjoy  them. People come here and feel a certain warmth. Almost everything  has a story, besides the story it   s telling, the story of acquiring it or  where it came from.  That   s a good point. You found a way of sharing your art. For example,  I know you have some pieces at the library here, since you   ve been  president. Is that the only place on campus?  Oh, no. In my office and the corridor in the administration building.  Then I put some art in some other places. Most of the Indian art is either  in the library or the administration building or here. I   ve given a lot of  art to the OCU art collection, but most of that has tended to be prairie  printmakers, not Native American.  I have a special feeling for Native American things that cause me to  want to hang onto them for a while. I will probably give the entire  collection to a museum at some point, or maybe part of it. I   m on the  advisory board of the Heard Museum, and that   s a very fine museum. I  may give some things there.  That   s something collectors have to start thinking about, isn   t it, at a  certain point?  There   s something about it. You sort of feel like maybe you should have  a big auction and let people have the joy of doing what you did, but  there   s also the hours and hours and hours of putting a collection  together. You think maybe it would be nice to keep that together so  people can see what was going on in various styles of painting in various  times.  Why is it important to collect Native art?  I don   t think anything tells as much about us as does our art. If a  spaceship landed in my back yard and a little green person, probably not  from Mars but probably from somewhere much farther than that, came  out and we figured out a way to communicate, and he said,    What are  you people like?    I don   t think I   d try to say,    Well, here   s what we do  in medicine.    If he   s figured out how to get here, he   s got a lot better  15  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  medicine than we   ve got. Or,    Here   s what we   re doing in physics,    or,     Look at this automobile, here. Compare it to your spaceship.     I think I   d say,    Let me show you some of the way that we express  ourselves,    like this Iranian artist that we   re looking at here. It   s an  amazing picture. You can see the influence of Islam in it. It   s not totally  to that, but there   s some animals in there. It   s an animated Islamic  painting, although Islamic painting doesn   t always issue human or  animalistic figures.  The same about our music. If I want to put our best foot forward, I might  say,    Well, here   s a Chopin waltz. This is what we can do when we   re at  our best,    or,    Look at this Jerome Tiger painting. Look at this  movement and this beauty and this story.    I mean, Tiger almost always  has a story, a specific story, as I said, Indian painting. I think art, good  art, puts our best foot forward.  Is there anything you   d like to add, anything we   ve left out before we  look at some examples of the things you   ve collected?  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. I think a painting  might be worth ten thousand words. (Laughter) Can we look at three or  four paintings?  Yes, let   s take a look. Would you like to tell us about this picture?  I thought we   d do about three quarters of a century of Indian art,  quickly. This is Stephen Mopope with the Kiowa Flute. We talked about  his color. Look at the beautiful colors. Look at that blue. It happens to be  almost OCU blue on the tipi, and the yuccas and the beautiful tones. You  can almost hear that flute. This is the flat style. This is the beginning of  Indian art: very flat, very primitive, and yet just dynamic with color in  telling the story. Those of us who   ve heard those cedar flutes can hear  that music.  That   s really nice. How about this piece?  We   re sticking with the Kiowa tribe here, but this is a little bit later. This  is Al Momaday, Scott Momaday   s father, a wonderful Kiowa artist.  Here are either Kiowas or Apaches. You see a little more movement, a  little more, perhaps, style, beautiful colors, but again, it   s not so much  color here as it is this wonderful scouting party. I think Al Momaday is  moving a little bit in a different way. You can see the influence of the  flat style, but it   s not purely, purely flat.  Some of that Southwestern influence in the back.  16  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Henry  Little Thunder  Exactly.  How about this piece?  This is Jerome Tiger, and, again you see we   re not flat anymore. There   s  movement in this picture. The buffalo is charging. The bison is charging.  The hunter is in his quiver. There is one arrow left, so the last arrow tells  all. There   s been three arrows that hit, one arrow that misfired, and we  have one chance to save our life. (Laughter) People are so passionate  about Jerome Tiger, and this painting, I think, shows why.  That   s wonderful. Do you want to do Houser next?  The great Allan Houser, kinsman of Geronimo, Apache. Here is a  woman, grinding corn. Beautiful, simple, but people that know his work  see it and immediately know that is Allan Houser. Alas, he   s so  expensive. I only have a couple of small pieces of his. One of  Oklahoma   s greatest ambassadors of art.  Great all-around sculptor. I love the colors on this one.  Finally, just to show we   re going different places and new places, this is  Ben Harjo, the Indian Picasso, he   s sometimes called. The Flow of  Creation. Maybe this is Mother Earth, but you see, again, very Indian  styles. This may be Kachina, and the birds and the crosses, which are  used in universal ways, this mountain symbol. Also, there   s geometry  and color coming back. It   s very Indian, and yet it   s very new and  different and just a piece that evokes a lot of feeling in my wife and me.  I see why. We   ll do this one, too.  This is a Harjo wood block that I referenced earlier, telling a Cheyenne  story from the Cheyenne way, a remarkable collection of Cheyenne  stories about law and jurisprudence. Here are the two braves that are  spoiling for revenge. They want to kill the person who killed their  friend. The peace chiefs have said,    Please, take our horses and don   t  violate tribal law. We   ll handle that in the council.    The braves won   t do  it. When the father of the deceased Indian comes to beg them,    Please,  do not add insult to injury. Please don   t kill another member of our tribe.  Take my horses and let the peace chiefs handle this,    this story is told in  this wonderful wood block.  I   m glad we got to see that. Well, thank you so much for your time today.  17  Henry You   re welcome. You   re welcome.  -------  -------
