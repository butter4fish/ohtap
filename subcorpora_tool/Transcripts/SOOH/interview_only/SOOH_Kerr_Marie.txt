 Wilson, and I   m with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University Library. Today is  February 18, 2011, and I am in Shawnee, Oklahoma, at the home of  Marie Kerr. I will be interviewing Marie today as part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Series. Thank you for having me  here today.  You   re welcome.  I understand you are not originally from Oklahoma. Let   s begin by  having you tell me about where you were born, your childhood, your  family, and your time growing up.  My name is Marie Louise Hejna, married name Kerr, and I was born  September 12, 1947 in Verdun, France. It   s very well known for the past  history of both wars, and that   s about it for now.  Tell us a little bit about your parents.  My parents, they   re originally from Poland, and they met in France right  before the war. My father was drafted in the French army as a Polish  soldier, and four months after the war when he was drafted he was  captured by the German army. He spent five years in a German camp,  which was Stalag 17. For five years, my mom did not know whether he  was dead or alive until he walked in the door. At the time, she had my  five-year-old older brother, and he also didn   t know what his father  looked like until he came back.  Wow. So was she able to correspond with him at all?  No, because Red Cross was such a shamble at the time that news or  information, you could not get through. So there was a big lack of  5  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  communication, and that   s one of the reasons she could not find out  whether my dad was dead or alive.  What was she doing during the war?  She was working as a farm laborer for this lady that my father knew  before he went to war. That   s what she did, and she knew very little  French, so it was very difficult for her.  Where was she living?  In Moulainville, France, which is about five kilometers away from  where I was born, from Verdun.  And what part of Poland was she originally from?  She was from what you call Little Poland. She was from Cikowice,  which is very close to Krak  w, (it   s Krakow) about forty kilometers. She  stayed there until she was roughly in her early twenties and came to  France.  How did she meet your father?  She met my father in France. He came from a different part of Poland.  The Poland that he came from was Big Poland, so there was always a  little feud between the two of them because she came from the little  Poland and he came from the big Poland, so he always felt better.  (Laughs)  Did they speak Polish to each other?  Yes, yes. Polish was spoken at home, and funny as it may seem, but we  kids didn   t know French until we went to French school. After that,  when they spoke Polish to us, we always answered back in French.  Do you know why they immigrated to France?  Well, from what I understand from both of my parents is that in Poland  there was a sort of propaganda about sending the young people out of  the country because they knew that an invasion was imminent, and they  were also in search of better life. Basically a better life.  Do you know how they got to France?  You know, that I do not know. I never asked them, but I believe it was  by train.  6  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  And did they come alone, or did they come with other newcomers?  They came alone. They came alone. They had a contract between France  and Poland that the French government did not follow very thoroughly,  so my mom was also a subject of abuse by the people that she worked  for until my father   when she started dating him, my father found out.  He wrote to the French embassy and Polish embassy about the abuse,  and those people were investigated. Her life was better after that.  Wow. What did your father do in France before the war?  Before the war? He was a farm laborer, also.  Do you know how they met exactly?  Well, the way they met, (and I heard both my dad and my mom saying  that) my dad worked in a different village than my mom, and someone  told him that there was this Polish girl in this next town. Curiosity got  the best of him, and he had to find out. So he went to this village, and he  saw her outside. Now, I don   t know how he recognized her. Someone  probably told him that   s the way she looked. He spoke to her in Polish,  and my mom did a double take because she was so happy to hear that  there was another Polish person around. That   s the way it started.  How long did they know each other before they got married?  Probably not very long. I think probably a year.  And then how long were they married before the war?  They got married in 1940. That   s just right at the beginning of the war,  and they were married, oh gosh, (I never counted) until they passed  away. Mom passed away in 2000. Dad passed away in 2005. So that   s  how many years.  Wow. How many siblings do you have?  Four. One older brother, older sister. I   m the third of four kids, and I   ve  got a little sister.  What have you heard about your father   s time in the war?  He   s the one   this is amazing too. Every winter we would gather around  our wood stove that heated the whole house, and them, drinking their  little cup of tea, they would tell a story about the war. I guess it was a  7  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  way of my dad releasing the pent-up frustration and hurt that he had  gone through, and my mom, also.  Do you want to share any of those stories that you remember?  Well, I   ve got so many of them. I can tell you the story of my dad, when  he was in Stalag 17, and, by the way, that was in Austria. From what I  understand, he disobeyed some rules, and the German guard punished  him by putting him outside for a whole day in the cold at attention  without a jacket, shoes, or anything. So needless to say, that was very  harsh and inhuman. He talked also about being chased by German guard  dogs in that prison camp, and also being butted by a gun for some reason  I do not know. Also, the food that they had to eat was moldy. Some of  his friends died of dysentery. They were full of fleas, ticks. They slept  on straw and straw floors, or I don   t know exactly what it is, but very  inhuman. He also remembered the day that he was liberated, amongst  many others, by the Americans.  What did he tell you about that day?  That was a happy moment, you know. Of course, he didn   t go in details  after that, but all I know is that they went to Paris, and that   s when he  received his liberation papers. I   ve got some of them. Anyway, that was  very hard. He remembered also whenever he first went into the   before  he was captured he was a medic, and he had to retrieve the wounded and  the dead from the front lines. When they got captured, they had to walk,  like, two days without food or water. Some of them made it. Some of  them didn   t.  Do you know exactly when he was captured? Does he know the date?  Yes, I do. If I looked on the paper.  How long was he in Stalag 17?  Five years.  Was he sent immediately to that concentration camp?  No. They walked to the German border for two days. After that, I don   t  know how they were picked up, maybe by the German forces, and he  went from camp to camp to camp. I think there were several of them  before he ended up in Austria at the so-called Stalag 17.  Do you know the names of any of the camps that he was at beforehand?  8  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  No, I don   t know, but they were at the Stalags, I do know. My brother  may know, and I may have to ask him.  What did he do on a day-to-day basis in the camp, what kinds of tasks?  Well, they were used for hard labor. They were used to build railroad  tracks, to dig ditches. To build other compounds was basically it. They  were sent, also, to German farms to help farmers.  Do you know if he kept in touch with anyone he met in the camps later in  life?  No. Well, he did with some of them that were liberated, but they were  not in the same camp, and they became our good friends. It was a ritual  of good company, always talking about wars and also singing the songs  that they sung while they were in the army. Of course, they were Polish  songs. Actually someone that was in the camp with them, I don   t think  so.  So he came home to your mother.  He came home to my mother five years later, and it was a big shock for  my mom because she didn   t know that my dad was even alive. My  brother was looking at this man and did not want this man around  because he was so used to being with Mom all the time, and he did not  want to share Mom with another person.  What did your dad do then, when he got back, for work?  What did he do? I think he was, at the beginning, he was a   gosh, what  do you call that? He was going in the woods. He worked for this person  that had a lot of wooded area, and he would cut the wood to sell it. What  do you call this type of person? A logger?  Yes.  I would say. He did that for quite a while, while he was remodeling a  home that he had bought that was an old train station during World War  II. So between the two, and taking care of the family, that   s what he did.  Also, he had started a farm, a little farm, but in the meantime, he wanted  to make a little bit more money. He worked for the US Army when the  US Army came to France, and worked in the laundromat, I believe.  And what was your mom busy doing?  She was a homemaker and taking care of the little farm we had. Never  9  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  worked outside for anyone after that.  What do you remember about your childhood growing up in France?  Back then, I thought I was the most miserable person. (Laughs) We  grew up in a home that didn   t have running water, no indoor plumbing,  no electricity, but I didn   t know any different because that   s all I knew. I  remember the cold, cold winters, a lot of snow, a lot of ice, and I had to  walk to school four times back and forth because we didn   t have what  you call a cafeteria at the school. I had to go back home and eat and go  back, and it was, like, about a six-mile trek every day.  Wow.  It was hard, but, like I say, we didn   t know any better, so that was a  thing we had to do.  Would your siblings go home with you and back to school?  Yes. Oh, yes. I remember many times staying inside of the classroom,  soaking wet, and couldn   t do anything until I got back home. You know,  when I look back on it, that was happy times. I had my family. My  parents were strict parents, but I thank them every day for that.  What are some values and principles you learned growing up that stuck  with you throughout your life?  I learned, oh, gosh, so many of them. I learned to be thrifty. I learned to  not look down on people, no matter where they come from. I learned  that in hard times, you   ve got to survive and make the best of it, and I  learned the value of family life. I don   t know what else is there to say. I  mean, there   s so many good things.  Were you raised going to church?  Yes. Oh, yes. I went to Catholic school for quite a few years. It was  about three times a week because you had to do what you call the  teaching of the catechism.  Besides that, do you remember any extracurricular activities or things  you liked to do outside of school?  Well, actually, we didn   t have any. It was working on the little farm.  Didn   t have a radio but a little transistor radio that my dad did not want  us to turn on unless he did because he didn   t want to use the batteries, so  we didn   t listen to music or anything like this. Very seldom. Mom  10  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  listened to the news, and so did my dad. You know, we just did things. I  loved to read, so I read a lot. We had a lot of chores, a lot of chores.  What were some of your chores?  Oh, my gosh. Taking the cows back to the pasture, milking my goats,  working in the big gardens that we had. We grew all of our vegetables  and chopped wood for Mom to have for her cooking stove.  Would you help your mom cook?  Oh yes. Yes, but mostly my mom wanted to be left alone, but I watched  my mom cook a lot.  What are some of your favorite dishes you remember her making?  Oh, her Polish cakes. Her Polish cakes and her Polish soups. My mom  was such a good cook. It   s hard to say. I was not a picky eater, so I loved  everything she did.  Do you make many of her recipes today?  Oh yes. Yes, I think some of them   I think they appreciate them. Some  of them, like Latasha Wilson. (Laughter) So, yes, my mom was a very  good cook. Basically my mom cooked, and I grew up with Polish  cooking mixed with French cooking and German cooking.  Did you learn English in your French high school?  No, I never learned English in school. I just heard it from people. The  person that I first heard it from was my sister   s husband, boyfriend at the  time. He was stationed in France, not far from where we were. He was  an American GI, and that   s the way I got acquainted with the language.  Then, after that he started bringing comic books, and I   ll never forget the  comic book Betty and Archie. I never saw a comic book in my life, and I  took my French and English dictionary that my mom had for some  reason, and I translated every word for word. When I got done, the  sentence didn   t make any sense, so I had to redo my sentence where it  would make sense, and that was basically the way I got acquainted with  English. Then as time went on, I started speaking a little bit more, and  then when I started working for the US Army at the age of seventeen  and a half as a secretary, this is when I became more fluent.  So had you graduated from high school?  Yes, yes. It was a French technical school, and that was it, where I  11  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  would learn a trade. It was secretarial trade. Then when I came here, I  passed my GED, then started college, but with my job and four kids  something had to go, and it had to be school.  Tell me about working for the American Army in France.  That was one of my best times, my best jobs. I enjoyed it to the fullest,  and, fortunately, when our president Charles de Gaulle told the  American forces to leave France, I was left with the choice of not having  a job or transferring to Germany with them. I chose to transfer, so I  worked also in Germany for a year before coming to the United States.  Where at in Germany did you work?  Zweibr  cken, by the French border. Good times.  And is it true you met your husband during this time?  No. I met him over here in Aline, Oklahoma, and it just so happened that  he was my sister   s brother-in-law.  What made you decide to the move to the United States?  Well, first it was a thing about adventure, and also to see my sister that  had immigrated to Oklahoma because of her marrying an American  citizen. I would say the first would be adventure and seeing my sister,  and adventure it was.  What did you do when you got here?  I basically didn   t do nothing but visit, and that   s when I met my future  husband.  So were you planning on staying when you came, initially?  No, I was not planning on staying. I was planning on staying six months  because that was the length of time that my visa was for, but it just so  happened I got married, and I stayed.  So where did you live then?  Well, it   s kind of not strange but unfortunate that a week after we got  married, my husband went to Vietnam for a year, so I stayed with my  sister in Aline, Oklahoma, for the whole year. Then he got assigned for  another year to Germany, and I went to Germany.  12  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Then what happened?  That was so close to where I   m from in France, it   s so close to Germany  that I traveled a lot by train to see my family, and it was a good time,  good time. Then after the year was up, I came back to the United States,  and I   ve been here ever since.  And what did you do in the United States when you returned?  I was just a homemaker. I started having my kids, so I was busy with  kids. Then when they started going to school, there was another busy  time. Then unfortunately after seventeen years of marriage, I divorced,  and I started working for General Motors. I worked twenty-five years for  them, and that was a very busy time between work, kids, and taking care  of my house.  Would your parents come visit you?  My parents came several times. In fact, they even came over here to stay  between 1972 and    73, but they returned. It was too hard for them to get  used to another country, and the language barrier was a little too much  for them. Even though I was sad that they returned, I was happy that  they were going back to where they were maybe happier.  Were they planning to move to Oklahoma?  Yes, they lived in Alva, Oklahoma for a year, probably a year and a half,  I would say.  What did they do during the year?  What did they do? My mom, as usual, homemaker, and my dad was a  janitor at  Northwestern Oklahoma State  University.  Do you remember some of their perceptions of Oklahoma or the United  States?  So, so different than where we were from. I, myself, whenever I came, I  cried because I thought I had landed to the Sahara Desert. My folks  thought the same thing because where I   m from it   s so green, a lot of  hills, a lot of valleys, and a lot of trees. Northwest Oklahoma was just  like a desert to me and to them. And too hot. Absolutely too hot to this  day. I cannot stand the heat.  What were some of your perceptions of the culture?  13  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Culture? Oh my. Culture was a culture shock for me. Totally different. I  was more reserved. Here, people are more relaxed. You make friends  very easy, opposed to where I   m from. You have a lot of reservation of  what your next friend is going to be unless you   ve known them all your  life. There   s more opportunities over here, business-wise, in many areas.  Back home, it   s more government-controlled. I mean, now, after so  many years, this is my home, and I   m kind of stuck. I   ve got my kids  and grandkids, but I like it. (Laughs) I like it, but home is always home.  Yes, I do get homesick. Yes, I miss my family, my friends. I   d like to  see them more often. A good thing is that I have a French friend that I  talk French with and a sister here that I can talk French with, so it kind  of makes it a little more homey.  Are there many things besides the people and relationships that you miss  about France?  What do you mean? Like     Like a way of life, or foods, or the closeness of other countries, or  anything like this?  Oh, you   re talking about food? Food, oh gosh. I miss French food. I will  always miss French food. American food is, to me, more of a fast way of  fixing and eating, opposed to where I   m from. We take our time to enjoy  food, and we take pride. Not that you all don   t do it, but it   s more like,     Hurry up, hurry up,    and I   m that way, too, now.  So now do you consider yourself an Oklahoman?  Yes, I am an Oklahoman now, Franco-Oklahoman, I would say.  (Laughs)  Have you met many other French people in Oklahoma?  Yes, I   ve met my friend at work at General Motors here in Oklahoma  City. We always make jokes together because I come from the  northeastern part of France, and she   s from the southeastern part of  France, by the Riviera. I always tell her that she   s the Rebel and I   m the  Yankee. (Laughs) I   ve met her, but not too many, not in Oklahoma.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oklahoma means country. Nice people, laid back, I think. I mean, I  cannot complain. America has been good to me. Believe it or not, I   ve  had family over here since my great-great-grandfather that is buried in  Buffalo, New York, so, you know, we date back a long time. I   ve got  14  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  family that emigrated from Poland, also, in Chicago and Florida, so  we   ve been here quite a long time. It   s my country, and like my dad  always said, even though he was in France, his first country was Poland,  and his second country was America. I guess France came third.  (Laughs) It   s a good country and the best. I can say that because I know.  I can make the difference because I come from another country, but you  all are so blessed to be here.  Do you maintain contact with the family members you have that went to  Chicago and Florida?  Well, my daughter. Now, my cousin I need to renew my contact, and I  mean to do that every time, and then it just gets put on the back burner.  Now, as far as my family in France, yes, I do keep contact, and my  friends, also, my childhood friends, yes.  Well, do you have any more stories or things I haven   t asked you about  that you   d like to share?  Oh, goodness. I   ve got so many, and it   s just unfortunate that I don   t  have them taped. My stories. I could tell you the story of when I first  came to the United States. When I took my first plane ride, never  realized that America was so, so far away. I was twenty years old. I  boarded in Luxembourg, which was close to Verdun, France, and my  whole trip I stayed awake. I didn   t even recline my seat because I didn   t  know you could recline them. Needless to say, I was so scared, and I  was so tired when I got to JFK Airport in New York. I had to take  another plane in LaGuardia Airport, and thank God for this nice man  that helped me get to LaGuardia because he was going there, too. After  that, I landed in Tulsa, and my sister and her husband came and picked  me up.  When we were going from Tulsa to where they were from, the whole  trip I was looking for tepees and Indians and cowboys because that was  the perception of Oklahoma and Texas in France. So needless to say, I  was just looking and asking my sister,    Where   s those Indians? Where   s  those tepees?    (Laughs) They told me,    Well, that   s only in movies and  storybooks.    Also, those tumbleweeds that were flying across the road, I  could not imagine things rolling across the road. Finally, I asked my  sister,    What were they?    and they explained to me what they were. It  was unreal. Then we stopped and ate at a restaurant midway, and it was  so amazing to me that you could place your order on the phone by your  table, and there was a jukebox. I had never seen that. I thought,    Oh, my  gosh.    That was just so amazing to me that they could bring your food to  your table by phone.  15  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Ker  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  What year was it when you came?  Nineteen sixty-eight. The fifth of January, 1968, and cold in New York  when I landed. Then again, it didn   t make any difference to me because  it was that cold in France, too.  And was it in the United States that you fell in love with a particular  singer?  Oh, yes. Well, that was not in the United States, actually. I was, like,  between twelve and thirteen years old, growing up in France, when my  sister met her future husband who was an American GI. He bought my  first Elvis Presley record. I couldn   t listen to it because we didn   t have  any electricity, so he bought a portable record player. I guess it was with  batteries. I wore that thing  out  because until this day, Elvis Presley is  my number one singer of all times. I even have a little shrine in my  home. (Laughs) Yes, that   s a long time.  What is your most prized Elvis Presley memorabilia?  Got so many. Got so many, but I would have to say it   s a picture that  was taken when he was in the Army in Germany that was given to me by  my brother-in-law.  It   s an actual photo?  It   s an actual photo.  Oh, wow.  I would have to say that   s my most prized possession because it   s real.  Well, is there anything else you can think of right now that you   d like to  talk about?  Oh, goodness. I don   t know. I think I talked my fool head off, (Laughs)  but if you can think of something I   ve forgotten, just ask me.  Well, I want to thank you for letting me interview you today and having  me here.  Well, you   re welcome, Latasha. Always a pleasure to talk to you.  All right, so in talking about your memories of your mom cooking and  some chores you had growing up, we remembered that there are some  artifacts around the house. Marie is going to show us a few of the things  16  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  she has from her childhood in France that she remembers her parents  using and her using. So what would you like to start out with?  Okay, I want to start out with this potato masher that my dad carved out  of a piece of log. This was our potato masher, and I built my muscle on  that, mashing a lot of potatoes during my younger days. I saw it one year  when I went back to visit my father, and he had it in a junk pile. I said,     Dad, I want to take that back because this is a reminder of my chores.     So, anyway, I got it back. It   s kind of used up. Got a big crack there.  But carved from a solid chunk of wood.  Solid chunk of wood. He chiseled that somehow. I don   t know. I was  very young at the time, so I don   t remember how, but I do know he did it  on his own.  Wow. What else do you have?  I have this coffee maker. That, again, muscle maker. It was my job to  grind my mom   s coffee beans for her coffee in the morning, or all of us.  Needless to say, my mom always made coffee in a big pot, and she  always put malt and chicory. The coffee wasn   t too strong, but we kids  in France, we drank coffee, when we were young, with a lot of milk. It  goes like that, (Demonstrates) and it still works. (Laughter) Let me see.  This here is a French scales during the 19   I don   t know, a long time  ago. My mom used that to measure the flour, the sugar for her good  Polish cakes or sometimes French cakes. On top of that, there   s also  weights. That   s a two-kilo, and this is a smaller one. I don   t have my  glasses on, so I can   t see. (Laughs) This is made out of copper. This is  another weight that they used to have. Now, of course, it   s all  computerized, so those types of scales are mostly antiques.  So she would set those on one side and her flour on the other to see how  much.  Yes. The weight   s on one side, and the flour or sugar on the other side.  And this, my mom ironed her clothes with this iron during the war. It  opens up this way, and you put coal, and you heat it up. You heated this  iron with coal. I don   t know how she did that, but she did it. This was  my little iron. She would set that on top of the wooden stove, and when  it got really hot, I had chores to do, and it was ironing all of the  handkerchiefs and the dish towels. Mom ironed everything, even sheets,  back then. (Laughter) This is a foot warmer. This is very old. It belonged  to the lady that my mom worked for that became my brother   s  godmother. What you did, it opens up, and you place a brick that you  heat in your oven, a regular oven. Once the brick is hot or warm or  17  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  whatever, you just place it inside, close it back down, and put your feet  on top, and it   s a foot warmer antique.  This is a coal lamp, and this is what we used at home since we didn   t  have any electricity to light our area where we ate, our kitchen, our  bedrooms. We had several. I did my homework by this type of light, and  later on we modernized our lighting a little bit more, and we had what  you call gas lighting. The reason we didn   t have any electricity is  because our home was an old train station, like I stated in the beginning,  and there was no electricity back there. We were the last house from our  village, and the government did not want to extend the electrical wiring  all the way to our house. It would   ve had to have been at our expense,  and back then my dad didn   t have a lot of money. He did not want to pay  for what the government should   ve put there in the first place.  So you just did without.  We did without, yes. That was before my time. This is what Mom told  me, that during the war when they had curfews, and I don   t know what  you would call it. The village had to turn off all their lights so the enemy  would not see light from up above, and afraid to be bombed, so my mom  would light her bedroom or kitchen with this little kerosene light, I  guess. We called it in French lampignon. She would always tell us that  whenever she would wake up and my brother would wake up, because  he always slept with her because he was very small, their noses were full  of soot, inhaling the fumes. But that   s that.  Tell me about transportation around France.  Transportation. I   ve got to say, French people drive crazy. I, even until  today, do not like to drive in France. I think the people here are more  courteous about their driving. Over there, they   re just like go, go, go, but  yet, they   re laid back, but when it comes to driving, I do not like it over  there. My mom and dad never owned a car, never drove. The only time  that my dad drove a car was from my sister   s husband, American GI,  back in France, and instead of stepping on the brake, he stepped on the  accelerator and ended up in a field across the fence. (Laughter) That was  funny at the time, but he was scared. Never drove.  You also mentioned a relative or godfather that worked in the salt mines  in Poland. Do you want to talk about that?  Yes, my mom   s brother, named Karol. He passed away quite a few years  ago at a very young age from a heart attack, but he worked in the salt  mines of Poland in Wieliczka. I remember that. I remember my mom  always said   and I don   t know if this is true, but she said that the mine  18  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  Wilson  Kerr  had a way of attracting lightning. Every time there was a storm,  lightning always struck that mine. Any truth to that, don   t know, but  that   s what she always said.  Do you remember hearing about how much he made or what kinds of  things he did?  No, that I don   t remember, but it must have been okay since he kept on  working until he passed away.  What would he do in the mines?  That I don   t know. Probably everything. Maybe carving some with  statues that adorns the salt mines. Could be some of that, but basically it  was a way of life and maybe making a living.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about?  Well, I don   t know if you want me to say what my dad always said  about Pope John Paul. My mom came from a very religious background  and still was in France, and we always said our prayers. I   ve got to say  that. When we were little, before we went to bed, we would always get  on our knees in front of the cross in our kitchen, and we had to say our  prayers in Polish. That was a must. My mom, later on when the Polish  Arch Bishop became Pope, my mom had pictures of the Pope all over  the house. My dad used to joke with her and kid with her all the time. He  would say to me,    See, Marie, she   s got her boyfriend all over the  house.    Of course, my mom didn   t take it very funny, and he would say,     Yes, see, she don   t even have a picture of me, but she sure got it of her  boyfriend.    (Laughs) That was an inside joke, but she always liked him  because he came not too far from her hometown of Poland.  Well thank you for sharing those things.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
