WILL HOGGARD: A11 tight. So I’m here with Miss Laun'e Fuchs the founder of
Ladyslipper. We’re here in I guess the new office building warehouse, something like that, with
a lot of boxes and everything. But I’m just going to ask Miss Fuchs a few questions and see
what happens. So yeah, how did you get, just generally speaking, how did you get the whole
idea to even start something as big as what Ladyslipper has become I guess?

LAURIE FUCHS: Okay. Well, it wasn’t really an idea to start something big. I never
thought it would become as big as it did. And as you probably know it was bigger, we probably
had our peak years in the mid-nineties by then. And so it has really done an arc in the size. But I
began as a young woman, long time ago, in my twenties, and I had recently moved to Durham
from mral southwest Georgia where I lived in a very interesting community that was involved in
a lot of local economic work, and it’s something called Koinonia, some people—

WH: Koinonia, what exactly—

LF: Well, I was a community that was founded in the [l9]40s, an interracial community
back when that was a really weird thing to do and a risky thing to do in southern Georgia. And
that’s a really long story. So Iwon’t go into too many details, but just to say that there were a lot
of economic development projects that were, that spmng up there in farming and sewing and

pecan products, bakery things. And it was also one of the endeavors that was happening was

building housing low, housing that was in order to remedy some of the really dismal housing
situations locally. And so houses were built using local people and as low cost in as low cost a
way and the houses were sold with no interest loans. This became, this was the sort of blueprint,
the people who were doing this then moved into town, and it began Habitat for Humanity. So
that was the beginning of that. So many interesting organizations had their birth at Koinonia.
But one of the things that helped me being there was whatever ideas we had or needs we saw, we
were encouraged and had to just go ahead and do sort of follow the ideas to the best of our ability
to really be serious and focused and do that.

WH: Okay. I was talking with Mrs. Barb about a little bit of background about you like
a while ago. Is this the same, she said it was like, is it the same like as the commune I guess in
south of Georgia or something like that?

LF: Yes. Yes. It wasn’t exactly a commune because it wasn’t like, there was also a
commune movement at the time that was more of a back to the land, the [l9]60s and all that.
This really had started way before that and I think not that [l9]60s communes weren’t seﬁous,
but this was not a drugs rock and roll kind of a place. It was really a social justice oriented
organization. So and I could talk for the whole hour about that, but I know we are not here to do
that.

But anyway, so I moved to Durham. I was ready to move on to something else. Ihad
become interested in feminism. I had thought about, Ihad, there was a magazine there called
Win which was sort of the War Resisters League publication, and there was a very interesting
conversation going on with women who were involved in the peace movement and feminist
movement and the early lesbian/gay movement. There was like a lot of writing and conversation

and things like this in the magazine. And I would be running the printing press late at night, and

I would just be reading the magazine and thinking wow that’s really interesting, fascinating.
And so I started wanting to know more about those ideas and somehow or other--. And so that
was also the time of just the early second wave feminist movement where there are a few
women’s bookstores starting to open, and we had a little consciousness raising group there at
Koinonia with some of the women, some were married; some were single. We were just
exploring what did feminism mean. What were the ways that we didn’t feel really good about
some of the sexist practices that were both happening institutionalized there and were happening
in relationships and we could see them sort of in our culture and things like that.

So anyway I got a hold of somehow or other, there was a nonproﬁt book service, and it
was called First Things First. And First Things First meant partly they were listing the women
by their first names because of the tradition where the last names were came from a man. And
sort of in the same way that immigrants were given an anglicized name or slaves were given an
owners’ name, women were always from a tradition where the father gave the last name, and
then the husband gave the last name. The woman had no identity aside from that. So in this
magazine, it was sort of just a newsprint ﬂyer. It was a listing of books of, that spanned maybe
not just current literature but older than that too. And it was just a really important resource to
me personally because I could order them from them if I had any money, which I didn’t have
much of or go to my local library and Check out books. And I would go in there with that
reading list and find things even in Americus, Georgia. And I could also take them if I found
one of the few new women’s bookstores I could go in there and buy myself a book or two. And I
started reading these feminist, feminist ﬁction and non-fiction, and it was just, it was just a very

amazing exciting time of ideas that were just--. So that’s just some background.

Okay. So then in the music world there were a few performers who were coming into my
awareness. Holly Near was one who someone saw her up in Durham and came back to Georgia
with an LP [Long Play record album “Vinyl”]. And we listened to this, and we were just amazed.
It was just so political and so personal and powerful and not, it wasn’t just sort of—-. There was
folk music and there was important--. There was jazz and blues and other genres of music but
this was more, it was just so personal and so—I'd love to have this album. Where can I get it?
So we would have to wait for the performer to come again on tour somewhere because you
couldn’t fin --. That was the only access. There was no internet; there was no download. That
was the only access.

Okay, so then when I moved here the very young movement of women’s music was just
beginning, and artists would come to town every once in a while. And they would be feminist,
and they would, some of them were lesbians, and this was just like we were very excited. Most
of us were doing living like on almost nothing and wanted to be involved in various kinds of
cultural, political, social oriented work. This was like exciting. So then we, Iheard about this
national women’s music festival. This is the one we were just talking about where they are
going to do A Rainbow Path performance.

WH: Okay.

LF: They’re doing this performance this June, but this festival has been going since
1974. It was founded because at the college, I think it was University of Illinois, there was a
music festival happening. There was a woman student there that looked at the roster, and every
performer was a man, every last one. She said how about some women, and they’re like we

don’t need to, no, we’re all set. No reason for that.

WH: This is before, she asked that before I guess everything was like set up or that was
while they were planning.

LF: I think they were planning. She could not get any—.

WH: Yeah, gotcha.

LF: I don’t know exactly at what point she tried to get involved. But whatever it was,
there was no way. It just struck her as really imbalanced. So she decided she was going to have
a women’s music festival and she just planned one and invited probably some pretty big name
artists and just sought, waited to see who would come and had, had a festival that people just
loved and responded to and it sort of built year by year, a lot of energy.

WH: Is this the same one that Miss Barbara was talking a while ago about I guess, there
was a festival going on and you decided to post pamphlets and stuff on the cars and then it
rained?

LF: That was the, yes, that was the Michigan festival, and that’s the first year of
Michigan was [l9]77, was [l9]76, [l9]76. So yeah, that’s a funny story.

WH: Well, if we have time, you would like to share.

LF: Yes, we can definitely talk about that. So anyway, went to the national women’s
festival the third year they had it just because some friends were going and we drove up. And
just absolutely loved it, and there were all these wonderful artists who had no distribution. There
was no way to get their music. Some had been performing for a long time like MalVina
Reynolds had been a folk artist for years and years. Pete Seeger recorded some of her songs.
She was there and lesser known artists and a lot of participatory kinds of things where there were
jam sessions and round robins and workshops and very exciting stuff. Some women had LPs,

and some had little cassettes they had made themselves, no distribution. So I thought I would

like to maybe start, start something like a First Thing First was for books. How about we do
something for music because it’s insane. This is what I want for myself. I think that was really
the key. This would, this was something that I needed in my own life, and I knew other people
who needed this in their life, and it wasn’t, it wasn’t any where to be found. So I thought, okay,
I’ll just set up a little something with these artists to buy a few of their recordings and I’ll put out
a ﬂyer or a little newspaper or something. And I think I was working at a print shop already, and
that was kind of key because I had access to create pamphlets and ﬂyers for things.

WH: This is all like the beginning of Ladyslipper.

LF: Yes. So I also had the idea at the time I was going to do a crafts catalog and market
women’s crafts, and so I was making a little booklet. Ihad solicited some craftswoman to see if
they wanted to go in sort of like a cooperative thing. And it turned out Ihad some pages empty.
They were folded. So I thought well, I’ll just start this little music things right now right here.
Four empty pages, I’ll buy some and write a little description and put these out and send these
little catalogs out and I did that. I was working, there were some other women who were
working in support on this. My partner at the time, Joanne Abel, she was working with me. So
in the very beginning it was two of us, and because of my printing job I could go in. I could
hand draw the things. I could make the negatives. I could shoot the place. I could run it on the
press, just for the cost of paper they let me go in after hours and do this. If I had had to pay for
this printing, I probably could not have afforded to do this. It wouldn’t have happened. And
then there was another woman in town and she was the OliVia distributor. And they had just
started up their distribution network for recordings by women, and they had an idea for there to
be an all women’s label with all women engineers and performers and that women would have

control of every part of the process. It was a great idea and it was very oriented—

WH: So what was the name of the lady that started this again?

LF: Well, that was OliVia Records.

WH: Oh okay. Yeah.

LF: They had started already. They started in [l9]74. Seventy-four or [l9]75, there
were a couple of labels, women’s labels and lesbian oriented labels that had started in about
[l9]74. Maybe even there were a few things that came out on forty-ﬁve rpm [rounds per minute]
even in [19]7 3 or something like that. So when, let’s see the sequence, in the endeavor that we
called Ladyslipper, one of the labels I wanted to have in the Ladyslipper catalog was the OliVia
records. They had maybe four or ﬁve releases out. That was only part of what I wanted to do
but because I had other labels. I wanted to represent that the OliVia distributor did not represent.
So she and I started working to gether. Her name was Kathy Tomyris. She and I also already
worked together—

WH: I’m sorry, do you recall how to spell her name?

LF: Yes, K-A-T-H-Y first name, T-O-M-Y-R-I-S her last name.

WH: Okay. Thank you.

LF: So she was the OliVia distributor. We started working together. And a graphics, a
women’s graphics collective, and also she had started to produce some local concerts. And there
was a concert collective that she and I started working together in called ( ) Productions,
and we started working together to bring a variety of women artists in concert to just regular
venues and worked on a concert for women in prison, and there were various projects that we
just thought were fun and exciting and interesting to do. So at a point not too, not too much later

than that Kathy and I started working together in Ladyslipper. Ladyslipper hired, first hired her

10

and then she and Ibecame partners in Ladyslipper and kind of merged in her OliVia distribution
and the labels that Ladyslipper was representing. She worked, she was a typesetter. She—

WH: I’m sorry. So when you say Ladyslipper hired her, do you mean that you hired her
or you guys already had a pretty good framework of how the whole thing was—

LF: Well, we didn’t really have a framework.

WH: Okay, okay. I was just wondering.

LF: I think when we hired her I think we didn’t have a legal entity at that point. We just
figured that if she and I worked together, we could scrounge up $300 a month for her to work
full-time doing this. We just sort of said we would figure out how to do it. When she started
working with me, we did go ahead and start, we set up, did our tax thing, like our partnership.
That’s when I guess we became something legal. We didn’t like draw up legal documents or—-.
Okay, we were just--. I think a lot of people now are sort of more serious about a business. We
weren’t thinking of it that way. We were thinking of it as an activity, as a volunteer activity is
really how we thought. When she wanted to do it full-time and she wanted to stop having to do
anything else and just have her subsistence living which $300 a month was going to cover, we
just said, okay. We’ll try this.

WH: Okay so—

LF: So we did. And that’s when, so she was a typesetter. So she was working at
somewhere in Chapel Hill that she had access to the, she could use the typesetting equipment,
and she and I went in there one night, and well me just backtrack for a minute. So in addition to
Olivia records and women’s music, the lesbian oriented women’s feminist music that we were
doing, we also wanted to incorporate women from a wider historically deep and rich background.

Women who had been already doing, taking control of their own careers more or less. And

11

Mary Lou Williams was a one of those who was really important through all the jazz era and
Hazel and Alice from the mountains of North Carolina. And we started trying to do research on
what, what other women had been recording pretty much on their own terms. We went to two
music libraries and UNC was one and Duke music library was another. We said we’d like to
check out, borrow all the recordings by women that you have. And each library, and I kid you
not, had one or two women in their whole collections. I am just really not kidding you. Bessie
Smith was one that I remember they had. And for these university libraries to have nothing in
them. We had no idea how dismal this was and how underrepresented women were. It was just
ﬂabbergasting . So then we would start investigating folk catalogs, and we would just ﬂip
through page after page, and there might be 200 recordings in there and there might be one or
two women out of 200. It just, there was so, the opportunities for women even in the
independent music world were so limited.

And at the same time there were, there was a boycott going on of Warner Brothers. And
I just want to talk about this for a second. It was called Women Against Violence Against
Women, WAVAW was the name. And women were, it was a whole campaign because the
advertising that was happening in the major label world was indicative of the attitudes. One of
them was “I’m black and blue from the Rolling Stones and I love it.” That was the ad message
that you could see on a billboard, that you could see on a poster in a record store. It was just
really demeaning and horrible. It was just romanticizing and glorifying women as somebody to
slap around, a sex object. Women who wanted to go into, have a career would meet with a major
label executive and be told you have to wear this little short dress, and you have to have this
picture in this really sexy stupid way and not, so maybe this is all obvious and known to

everybody, but it’s really different now. It’s just—okay.

12

So back to the story of that first catalog that we produced together, Kathy Tomyris and I,
that Barb mentioned. We decided we were going to this Michigan women’s music festival
together and it was the second year. So we went to her typesetting place, and I was sort of say
some text and that she would type. And then we’d go over to my printshop and take the galleys
that she’d generated and slap them down as a paper and work them together in a darkroom and
shoot the negatives in the place and run them on the press and fold them and collate them. And
we worked all night so we had these two boxes of our first real catalog. We had done some ﬂiers
before but this was the first Ladyslipper catalog. Took them to this festival. There was nothing
organized there for vendors, and then the last day we thought we’d go to the parking lot and stick
them under people’s windshield wipers, and then there was a huge downpour. So they were
peeling them off. And we had no idea really what was going to happen. But we were oriented
towards the individual woman who would go home or find our ﬂier and want to order music.
Instead what happened there was a little bit of that, but instead what happened was a deluge of
women’s bookstores started contacting us. Women’s bookstores were not just bookstores. They
were community centers and they were like lifelines. It was just the beginning of this huge
movement that be gan just about then until there were hundreds and hundreds of women’s
bookstores all over the country and the world. But in the very beginning they would write to us.
They might send a postcard or they might call and say we want to order this music. We’d say we
don’t have it wholesale but here’s a, we’d hand write out a letter. Here’s a list of suppliers where
you can buy them too. Then we got a little smarter and mimeographed that. Then we said, they
still wanted to buy from us so we said okay we can give you a ten percent discount, but here is
where you can get a better price. Finally it just dawned on us that we just need to be a distributor

of all of this because they wanted, there’s a huge need. Why don’t we just go ahead and get set

13

up as a distributor for all of these women’s labels. Meanwhile women were coming to festivals
and women were learning how to do sound engineering and had a, have a label and record their
own. And it was just, there was, it was like you went into a desert field, and all of a sudden it
rained and just wildﬂowers and beautiful things of every kind sprouted up and started to grow
and take off and become a rainforest. It was just, so—

WH: Okay so Miss Barbara was talking and said you guys bought that house in what
was it, [l9]95.

LF: In Durham, yeah that building in [l9]95.

WH: So where, so where was I guess everything situated until about then like when you
said stuff was blooming?

LF: Well, yeah it started in my home, mine and Joanne’s home. And ﬁrst it was just a
few inches of the living room shelf.

WH: So in Chapel—

LF: Pretty soon it was the, that was in Durham on Clarendon Street. And pretty soon
took over the living room and then took over the dining room and then took over all the closets
and upstairs. Then we had to move to a bigger space. By this time Kathy Tomyris moved to
California. So we found a replacement for her, the OliVia distributor in Columbia named Liz
Snow agreed to come and take Kathy’s place. So she moved up to Durham, and she’d been
working at my house. It was, we had the idea to incorporate somewhere in there, and a friend of
ours really encouraged us to become non-profit because she thought our work was really
worthwhile, and she thought we could be eligible for grants. She was in fact a grant reader for
National Endowment for the Humanities. She said what you’re doing is just, we give grants to

people all the time. I don’t think they’re even doing something—I think you would really

14

qualify for this. We were also producing concerts. So we went ahead and, we incorporated
officially as a nonprofit, and got our tax exempt status and provided all the documentation for all
of this. And we went through a process of this. Do we just want it to have it be the concert arm
and not the distribution, but really it was all for the same purpose. It was to provide access to
and information about the recordings by women and we were digging into history and all, it was
going all over the country and the world in terms of artists that we were interested in and
providing the service for and lots, we were going to festivals and conferences with our catalogs.
They started getting bigger and bigger, and libraries started ordering from us and that was, they
would order a lot. Like they would say like we want these 100 titles from you. That was just so
really gratifying because that’s sort of one of the absences in the begimIing where there was even
if you wanted to study thism there wasn’t a way to do it. So after we outgrew my little tiny
apartment we moved into Liz’s house which was a bigger house. And we were there for a while.
Then in 19, somewhere in the [l9]80s we moved to a building on the corner of Gregson and
West Chapel Hill Street, which was called--. It was 602 West Chapel Hill Street Building, and
then right next door to us was all these social justice organizations like War Resister’s League
and Institute for Southern Studies and Prison and Jail Project and lots of people doing lots of
really great org—community work and so we were just right there. And we were there until we
outgrew that. In 1990 we moved sort of across the street. Oh and we outgrew it and somebody
else bought it tripled our rent, left us ( ). So we couldn’t stay there. So we went to
Vicker’s just sort of across the street. We were there for ﬁve years. We were busting out of the
seams there and in [l9]95 we bought the building on Hillsborough Road. And that was about the

time that the whole it was about the peak of what was happening for us in mail order and

15

distribution, and we had become a label during the course of that. Partly and do you want to hear
about how we did that?

WH: Yeah, definitely I was about to ask that. I was just typing to make sure I knew my
next question. So yeah.

LF: Okay. Well, there was an artist who we had, well we had started doing what we
called sub-distribution before this. That was when artists who could not keep up with packing
and shipping just sent us all their stuff. They just couldn’t deal with it. They were touring or
they were whatever. So we would set up with this whole network of distributors. We did the
shipping, billing. We publicized their work in the catalogs. Got them into the distribution
networks and all that. The next step was women who could not keep up with their
manufacturing. They just didn’t have the money saved. They got paid for their music and then
they spent it and they couldn’t repress it. So we started doing manufacturing for artists because
they weren’t business--some of them weren’t business people. Some of them were really good at
business. But some were just not and not there to do the day to day organization. They were
creative. They were writing music and touring and off doing that. And so the way we got into
manufacturing was just sort of, I guess it happened when an artist just said so I'd like you to do
this. What do you think about that? We’re like sure, that’s fine. And so by this time our staff
had grown, and we had staff people who were just handling that.

So there was an artist named Kay Gardner who had been planning this really major
release. Well, actually that’s not the very ﬁrst thing that happened, and I can just jump back for
one second. There were a couple of releases that were going out of print, and the artist and
labels were closing, folding. They had, they asked us somehow do you want to take these on as

like a license. We said sure we’ll do that because we’d already been manufacturing. So we had

16

a few sort of not minor releases exactly, but they weren’t, they weren’t big for us. But we got
our feet wet I guess in that a little bit and starting to deal, these were LPs pressing plants how
you do that. You have to have a test. They made, you had to take this piece of plastic and listen
to the whole thing and mark the times when you heard pops and crackles and the glass master
and whatever they were called. I can’t even remember now. But we learned that process then.

But anyway this artist Kay Gardner was planning this really major release and she was
planning it for, fundraising for it like a year or two. She was going to call it A Rainbow Path.
We said, “Okay Kay is it ready now?” Well, I don’t quite have the money raised. Well, I don’t
quite have the money raised. So finally after two years of us just being really excited about this
release, it was a music and healing release. It was right at the beginning of the genre. The genre
really was, it hadn’t happened yet, but there was kind of interest in that. So one day we just said
if we record, “Would you just like us to record this for you if—“ and she said, “Sure.” So we
said, “Okay we’ll do it.” We had no idea where we were going to get the money. We got
together a recording budget. We needed $20,000 or more than that. We were going to do the
recording, the manufacturing, the promotion, the whole thing.

So we had no clue how we were going to finance it, but we went out to the community
and asked for loans from friends and supporters, and we raised the money, and we thought we
really hope we can pay this back. And we put this release out and it was just very magical. We
sold over 10,000 copies in six months. And that was just a very, very amazing number for an
independent release. It went up to number, the New Age music genre was just like it hadn’t, it
was just like the first couple months where it had a name. And there were, this recording went to

number two in the New Age music genre. So anyway, that’s how that happened.

17

Then in the, we got very excited by that and so we thought well, let’s keep doing this.
This is great. Pretty soon we learned that not everything happened that way with every release.
Even though we thought things were really wonderful and worthy. It didn’t mean that that
finances were going to, that we were going to be able to recover the recording costs thereafter.

WH: Yes, ma’am. Well, I guess with that though didn’t it, it pushed, I guess, how do I
say it. The new category of music and all the things that you guys had been doing at that point
were you seeing it as a beginning to like be a women’s movement this is, that’s something that
triggered it or you’d always seen it I guess as being a part of that, the women’s music movement
for—

LF: Well, this was part of the women’s music movement. But it was also sort of, there
was another, there was the women’s music in the performing artist sense. And then there was
something else that was starting, which was called the women’s spirituality movement and that
was women getting together for a less male dominated spiritual experience and using music and
ritual and circle songs and chants and a very feminine, female not sort of a religion of a male god
in the sky. But something very internal, being more in touch with the earth, nature, ﬁnding out
about goddess religions of the millenniums past and incorporating all of that.

And so there was a lot of, there was a lot of crossover that was starting to happen in
genres. I’ll say throughout, even before this was happened there were, there were genres of
music that were sort of being crossover things. There was the women’s music movement, but
there was folk music. And established genre like that that was incorporated. Then there was
blues as a genre, and there was a lot of really feminist blues women who really wrote really
feminist lyrics and did really, so there were compilations coming out with that, both genres.

They fit both genres, and then there was for a while a really amazing movement of reggae music

18

with women who were writing very feminist lyrics. So we, as genres sort of became into
popularity, they sort of peaked and ebbed. We would start taking on in our distribution.

So women’s music was not, it wasn’t that there was way that you can deﬁne it by, these
are the artists that come to the women’s music festivals. But who was coming to the women’s
music festivals was broadening. A lot of the artists, some of the stores had women’s music bins.
But many artists were in other bins in the music stores. So it was, it was defined, but it was also
sort of a part of a bigger picture. And there were artists that belonged in two or three different
categories.

WH: So I guess like wit this thing, was it more like all women together or was it
something more like this music movement, like the lesbian women dominated that and then like,
I don’t want to say--. Was it different groups that dominated this particular aspects of I guess the
whole movement like let’s say something with music and then there’s like the whole movement
as a whole. Am I making sense or not so much?

LF: I’m not so—I’m not sure what—

WH: It’s hard, I’m trying to--. I can’t pinpoint it exactly. I just want, I guess what was
the, what were the exact dynamics I guess of the women’s movement like I guess as far as who
ran--.

LF: Who ran the women’s movement?

WH: Yeah. I mean know women but like—

LF: Well, I think there were different aspects of this part of the women’s movement.
There was certainly the bookstore and the literary, the written word. That was separate but part
of it. There was the music part. The women’s music and cultural movement was something that

we talk about and there were a lot of performers that were in this that weren’t music; they were

19

comedy or dance. Other kind of performance, the performance arts I guess were happening at
the festivals. Also there were women’s writing conferences, and there were lots of women’s
presses being formed and publishing huge numbers of books.

WH: Yeah, I’m sorry. So like how did the music movement differ from the women’s
movement like exactly? What were, was everything like meshed. Was it more of a blend or
more of like one thing’s like this way and one thing? Do you get what I mean?

LF: I think there was some blending and some not. There was also sort of the political
arm of the women’s movement, and there were the more established organizations like National
Organization for Women for instance would have their conferences, and there were lots of other
organizations that were—I mean there were hundreds of different kinds of women’s
organizations happening, and so there were certainly people--. There was women’s Visual art
movement happening, and that was sort of the movement unto itself but involved in the women’s
movement also. But I could personally don’t know that much about it.

WH: Oh okay. But where do you feel like because I know Ladyslipper I know you guys,
there was like music label or is a music label but with all the concerts things and stuff like that
that you used to do and garnering people together. Where do you feel like it fit more I guess as
part of the women’s movement or part of the music movement?

LF: I would say that Ladyslipper was really part of the women’s movement although I
wish I could say part of the music movement as a whole. And I think the women’s music
movement has had a real impact on what happened with women even lots of people never heard
of the women’s music movement, lots of people. And to some extent it’s sort of an
unacknowledged, many political and social movements have their music component. So and

they sort of move into the more of the mainstream consciousness of this, it was this movement

20

like the ciVil rights movement had a real music component. And there’s some documentation of
the music that’s happened. I’m not sure people really think about the music that much. But to
separate the movement from the music would be really hard because it was so much a unifying,
empowering support for the struggles. And for the women’s music movement there was a
similar for many, for many people there was a real empowering support that people derived from
just having the expression, having the hope and the, just the I guess empowerment is the best
way to talk about it. And there’s some documentation of it but not as much as I would like to
see. People know about the effects of the folk movement, all these parts of it are, all these
musics, all these kinds of music are part of the longer history. There’s a context for all of this.
And I think, I think to some extent there was a dismissal. I know for a fact, not to some extent.
To a big extent there was a real dismissal of what this was in sort of the mainstream arena.
People, do you remember the Lilith festival or have you ever heard of this?

WH: It sounds really familiar.

LF: Okay. Well, I guess it was, Idon’t know ift was [19]90s or [19]80s or when it was,
but these mainstream women decided they were going to do music festivals that featured women
artists. Because they got tired of wanting to be on a bill, two women’s acts together and
someone saying, oh we already have the woman act there. We can’t have two. As if lots of
men’s acts weren’t two, and they got tired of that, and so they decided to have a festival. So it
got a lot of mainstream publicity, but it was publicized as the first women’s music festival
completely ignoring the fact and they knew it. They knew there had been a ten or fifteen year
history of women’s music festivals already happening. And it was just really infuriating to have
mainstream media covering it that way, And even when we would submit a correction to

someone and say excuse me but could you be accurate in your, give some credit. Give credit to

21

the Lilith festival, that is fine. But give credit that there was a whole groundwork that was laid
by people before, before the Lilith festival could come to be.

WH: Yes ma’am. Yes ma’am.

LF: So the women’s music festivals deserve huge credit for keeping that going. There
was also, I just want to mention a huge network of women’s music production companies. There
were hundreds in like every metropolitan area and college town and these women were bringing
artists to their towns and bringing in thousands of people and doing this as volunteers. They
would say they broke even. If they said they broke even, it meant the artists got paid and the hall
got paid and the technicians got paid. The people who produced the concerts never got paid. So
it really ran on a lot of wonderﬁil volunteer effort. I just have to put in a plug for them. And
then I guess over time a lot of groups had sort of the burnout, and the venues started getting
smaller and pretty soon the internet came in, and the big box chains put the independent stores
out of business and Amazon helped put a lot of smaller stores out of business. That’s, I could
talk for hours about how that decline happened, but I think you hadn’t asked me that question.

WH: Yes ma’am. Well, I guess seeing how Chapel Hill, the Triangle area as a whole is
today is very progressive and very accepting of a lot of things. Do you feel like Ladyslipper and
the movement and everything that you guys did has a big part in that or how do you feel like that
affected a lot of the change that’s been going on.

LF: I think that when we were really active here producing concerts, I think it was really
a reciprocal relationship that we could do that here because of all the progressive people and
organizations and support that we got. We worked with a lot of student organizations as co-
sponsors, some other organizations locally to put events on with community church in Chapel

Hill was a great venue. We worked at the Cat’s Cradle sometimes, UNC. We did shows at

22

Memorial Hall and smaller halls there. So I think people have sometimes talked about
Ladyslipper as if we made it happen. We, give us, I mean I think we should, can take some
credit for pulling things together. But I also think we were also reﬂecting what was happening
already, and there was as way that the events we did gave a cohesive place for people to come to
and feel a part of their community. But there were other, there was a women’s newsletter that
was happening that was really important then to publicize things, and there was a real give and
take with lots of women came to volunteer at Ladyslipper to make things happen and so it was--.
When things like that happen, it’s really a I guess a synergy of some kind.

WH: Okay. Well, I don’t have to ask my next question. But yeah, I guess so being with
all this stuff that all the great things that I guess you’ve done. How do you feel like that’s, how
to say it. Do you feel like—I need to ﬁnd my question. Ikeep trying to memorize it, but yeah,
like how did your upbringing I guess get to, get you to where you are now, and looking back on
it, what do you think are some of the biggest things that made you such, I guess so strong in like
your beliefs as far as feminism and everything is concerned.

LF: That’s an interesting question. Well, let’s see. I guess I come from a family of
atheist Jews who argued things and ideas. Ideas were good. They were pretty progressive
politically. Probably I don’t know whether my mother was actually a card carrying socialist
back in the day. She could’ve been. I’m not sure. But they were of the, of that generation
where I would say there were a lot of, a lot of Jews of that generation for some reason and a lot
of other people too. But so they were always certainly Democrats and interest, some interest in,
they were strong union supporters, and I guess my father was in a teacher’s union, and so that

would’ve been their that background.

23

My mother went and got her master’s degree probably at a time when not a lot of women
were pursuing that. She was kind of, she was kind of feminist, and in her later years she really
had, she was a big supporter of Ladyslipper, and she would join a women’s center and women’s
groups and just liked to have that kind of dialogue and interest in things. I didn’t have a
background that said go out and do something you’re interested in. My background said go to
school, go to more school, go to more school be a teacher, get tenure, be set. Iused to kind of
wonder about that because my mother had gone to all this school, and then she got married and
she didn’t use anything that she went to school for. So that sounded kind of silly to me. But I
really hated school. I despised it. I tried to do independent study projects instead of having to go
to class, didn’t really like them. I did not, I think in my school I was the only person who didn’t
go to college from my class, immediately. Then I, I'd enrolled in a school. I didn’t go. I
enrolled in New College Sarasota, didn’t show up.

WH: Was there any reason or you just weren’t—

LF: I hated academic requirements. I thought I wanted to experience things, and I
wanted to do things. I saw no point in having a degree for no reason. I thought if I ever need
that for something I’ll go get it. But I didn’t, didn’t interest me. So it was pretty counter to that
upbringing. But when I went to the Koinonia community that I mentioned, that was, I went,
okay Iwent, I enrolled in Friend’s World College then. That was like an accredited school. I
was going to actually go for and get a degree by going around the world and doing work project
in each continent like the Peace Corps. And it was great that there was something like that. But
I went to Koinonia as my first in-country extended volunteer project, and I loved it there and I
didn’t, I ended up dropping out of Friends World—they raised the tuition. I didn’t want to have

to go into debt, take a loan. I didn’t want that. So I went back to Koinonia. Like I said the

24

attitude, whatever I think I got a lot of really good things there. I was there between ages
eighteen and twenty-three. So Ithink that’s where I got that kind of educational background that
said, you want to, if you envision something just do it. And so—

WH: Miss Barbara was telling me a funny story about, I think she said something like
the guy from Habitat for Humanity or something was like trying to make passes or something. I
can’t remember.

LF: Oh you can’t even put this in there.

WH: Yes, I’ll take it out. I’ll take it out.

LF: Yeah, take that one out.

WH: I’ll take that definitely out. Okay. I apologize.

LF: Was it in hers?

WH: Uh no.

LF: Okay. Well, actually you can leave it in there.

WH: Okay. Are you sure? We can definitely do away with it.

LF: You can leave it in there. I mean that was another thing, another thing in the culture
is that we didn’t talk about that. We got there, and we were, women, things were happening to
us. This was like part of the beginning of that women’s movement and feminism and how many,
how many men were getting away with the kinds of sexual harassment and nobody talked about
it. And we were, we didn’t even have a word for it. We didn’t share it even among us our, but
sometimes we did, but we didn’t even, we were sort of, we had a little bit of outrage but not even
that much. My younger sister came down there. She was sixteen, and she got manhandled by

someone in a position of authority there. And this is like, this is like child molesting as far as

25

I’m concerned. We didn’t call it that. So yeah, you can leave that in. And it wasn’t by that
person that you mentioned. But and Ihad a few of those experiences.

WH: Yes, ma’am. I apologize for opening that can of worms.

LF: That’s okay.

WH: But I appreciate it. I got a pretty good View and ideal about everything I feel like
show me like a lot, I learned a lot in this hour and some change. I think if I just want to thank
you a lot for your time. I really did learn a lot. I can’t express that enough.

LF: Well, good. Ithink what you’re doing is so great and one of the ideas that we’ve
just throwing, people are doing this in so many arenas. It’s great. A while back here’s a Vision
we never thought of. Do you know Story Core? Do you know what that is? Oh this is a great
oral history thing where people, they have these, I think the Smithsonian is archiving this stuff.
But they set up these booths and people come in for a few minutes, and it’s on audio and Video,
and they tell their story, whatever story they want to tell. They have them in like Grand Central
Station and they had booths, I think they had a Story Core booth down at Brightleaf or at, not
Brightleaf but that thing downtown that has a little river going through it. You know what I’m
talking about. I can’t remember what it’s called, the cigarette thing.

WH: Maybe.

LF: Where the ( ) operates from. It’s like in downtown Durham anyway. I’m
losing my vocabulary. But we did think we should just go around with a microphone and talk to
thousands of women who have been in the women’s music arena and just do an impromptu
interview and just put everything. So we started with some artist interviews. Did you find them
online or—

WH: Yeah, I’m editing those right now.

26

LF: Okay. Well great. Great. That’s wonderful. But this kind of work is really
important. So thank you.

WH: Thank you. Are there any last things that you did want to add?

LF: I’m sure I’ll think of lots of things I forgot to say.

WH: All right. I’ll do my best to get you copies of this.

LF: Oh good. Well, thank you so much. I enjoyed it

WH: Thank you so much. You too.
