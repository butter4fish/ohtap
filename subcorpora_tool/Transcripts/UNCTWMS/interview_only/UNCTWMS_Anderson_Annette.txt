Joey Fink:  It&#8217;s August thirteenth, 2010.  I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee, with Annette Anderson.  Annette, the first question I&#8217;d like to ask is if you could tell me a little bit about where you&#8217;re from, where you grew up, what your family was like.  Annette Anderson:  I grew up in the Midwest, born in Pekin, Illinois, lived all through my elementary school years in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Later, my family moved back to Illinois, spent many years in Chillicothe, Illinois, and then Springfield, Illinois. Actually in a small rural town, Ashland, Illinois, near Springfield.  I have a younger brother.  My mother was a piano teacher.  My father was a tool designer during the years we were in Indianapolis, with Allison Engine Company, which built jet engines, and then, when we moved back to Illinois, he was with Caterpillar Tractor Company.  Middle class.  Did the usual middle class kids&#8217; things: took piano lessons, speech lessons, ballet lessons, all those things.  JF:  Was there an expectation that you would continue on after high school to college?  AA:  I suppose there was, yes.  I think there was.  Went to a women&#8217;s college in central Illinois, MacMurray College.  Married immediately after college.  JF:  What year did you graduate college?  AA:  1955.  Moved to Kansas City, Missouri, and there went to the University of Kansas City, now it&#8217;s the University of Missouri at Kansas City.  Majored in public administration and had an experience there that was related to your interest in women&#8217;s issues.  I was interested in government and public administration, so I enrolled in the graduate program in public administration, which was at that time very well known because it was started by and run by a man named L.P. Cookingham, who had been city manager of Kansas City for many years. He was one of the greats of that profession, was president of the International City Managers Association, very well-known man.  And he had founded this graduate program and still taught there. It had some excellent faculty.    After I enrolled in that program, I discovered that I was the first woman to enroll in it, although nobody made any fuss about that.  There were other women in many of the classes, for instance, in the Economics Department.  After I finished the first year, there was a slight hitch, because nobody, including Dr. Cookingham, seemed to have thought about the fact that all of their graduate students were required to do an internship in the city&#8217;s Department of Research and Budget, which, again, was run by a very well-known municipal government leader &#8211; except it turned out that they did not accept women employees.  That was a problem for me and it was a problem for them because they couldn&#8217;t quite figure out what to do about it.  And I interviewed with the department and with the mayor and the city manager, and they all agreed that it was impossible for a woman to work in that department because they had their executive meetings in the all-male City Club, and all of the interns were expected to go to those meetings, and they had retreats at places where it wasn&#8217;t appropriate for women to go.  I had been taking a course in site planning from a man who was a fairly well known city planner at that time, and the University was trying to start a graduate program in city planning.  The Public Administration Department was encouraging graduate students to take optional courses, elective courses, in the Planning Department, so I had taken several courses in planning as electives.  The head of the Planning Department said he would be delighted to have me do my internship there.  So I did, and they counted that as my required internship in public administration.  Straight away I became a city planner.  I specialized in it in graduate school, and then later took the examination and spent my life as a city planner.  But that was an accidental career, all because they would not accept me in the city&#8217;s Department of Research and Budget.  JF:  That&#8217;s amazing that the space was so segregated by gender that it &#8211;  AA:  Yes.  JF:  What were the male reactions to this?  Did they just throw up their hands and say, &#8220;Well, this is how it is?&#8221;  AA:  That was basically it, yes.  And I threw up my hands, and that was the way it was in 1955.  There were things that just did not accept women, and there wasn&#8217;t either legal or social sanctions for discriminating against women.  JF:  That was going to be my next question: Were there any resources for you, or alliances, or &#8211;?  AA:  Not really, no.  JF:  Were there other women in some of the other graduate departments talking about similar problems?  AA:  I don&#8217;t know.  There wasn&#8217;t any movement of any sort, and I doubt that there were [resources or networks]. For instance, at that time, my boss at the City Planning Department was an economist, a woman who graduated from the London School of Economics and [she] was a senior staff person in the City Planning Department.  I think it was largely, perhaps, cultural that there were certain professions that allowed women and valued women&#8217;s input, and others didn&#8217;t.  My then-husband, after about four years in Kansas City, went to graduate school at the University of North Carolina.  I went to work at the Institute of Government there.  You maybe know of that now.  Then it was at the edge of the campus on Durham [Raleigh] Road.  I suppose it&#8217;s still in the same building.  JF:  What were you doing for them?  AA:  Well, the Institute of Government provides training and consulting to local governments in North Carolina.  I worked specifically on two studies.  One was  on local taxation, a study for the state legislature, and the other was a noncommissioned research study on attracting industry to cities in North Carolina, very interesting work.  After I finished there, I changed jobs.  I was assistant director of planning in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Then left there when my husband took a job in Winston-Salem and lived in Winston-Salem for three or four years.  Then went back to Kansas City.  JF:  How did you and your husband negotiate your careers?  You were both accomplishing a lot in your fields and moving up in education levels.  How did that work between you two?  AA:  I think generally it was assumed that his job took priority.  In fact, I think eventually a major conflict between us, and what led, among other things, to the termination of our marriage, [was] that we did not resolve those issues.  We finally moved [to Knoxville] because he took a job here, and for a while I worked for the University [of Tennessee, Knoxville] on a part-time basis.  Then, I took the job at the Community Design Center, and that was a very demanding job and led to continuing tensions over &#8211;  JF:  Were you a mother at this point?  AA:  Yes.  JF:  Did you have your children before or after you moved to Knoxville?  AA:  We adopted the children.  We adopted Tom, the older one, when we were in Winston-Salem, and I was not working then.  The next move was to Louisville, we adopted Sharon there, and during those years, I did not work at all.    In fact, the University of Louisville, when we were there, was starting an urban studies program.  And I knew nothing about it, just read about it in the newspaper, and thought it sounded interesting.  I thought I&#8217;d try to find out whether they were hiring research staff.  My then-husband objected strenuously, and I didn&#8217;t.  Then, as the children got older and we moved here, he encouraged me to take the job at the Community Design Center.  Tom was in high school by that time.  But the job was a very demanding job &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t a nine-to-five job &#8211; and that caused problems.  JF:  What year did you come to Knoxville?  AA:  Probably around 1968.  JF:  And you started working at the Design Center in &#8211;?  AA:  No, it might have been [19]68.  I didn&#8217;t start working at the Design Center until about [19]72.  JF:  What did you like about Knoxville when you moved here, and what didn&#8217;t you like about it?  AA:  Well, I think I liked then being close to the mountains [and still do].  I like the special culture of Appalachia: the music, the crafts.  And increasingly, I&#8217;m liking Knoxville.  I think I&#8217;ve always liked Knoxville for the interesting mix of people that we happen to get in contact with.  I like my work as a volunteer with the League of Women Voters, with my church.  But I find it, still, really frustrating to be in a place where I think, in general, political leaders are narrow-minded, [have] a real lack of vision.  I guess a common word is &#8220;conservative,&#8221; but I even consider myself, if I were being just analytical about it, somewhat conservative, but [they are] reactionary, wanting to go back to something that never existed, [to] some mythical time when things were entirely different and they think better.  I find it a very difficult place to accept politically and socially.  But we have good friends here.  I love the house.  And I loved working at the Design Center.  It was never, never boring.  Every day there was fun.  And it was really a good career.  JF:  Can you share a little bit about what the Design Center was created to do and how you first got introduced to it or involved with it?  AA:  Well, a little bit of context: I think it was incorporated in 1970, but it existed for a few years before that.  There had been a collaboration between the American Institute of Architects and the Urban League at the national level to address the kind of community problems that neighborhoods and communities experienced during the days of the Organization for Economic Opportunity, which was a Johnson administration program that provided funds for a wide variety of neighborhood and community projects in low-income communities.  But it didn&#8217;t provide any way for the people in those communities to have access to planners or engineers or architects, landscape architects, who might help them put together reasonable proposals for doing what they wanted to do.  JF:  So, the money was there, but what&#8217;s going to happen with it?  AA:  Not only the money, but also the means of organization, because there were funds for community organizers and for a way for a neighborhood to get together, but then, too often, what happened &#8211; well, there were many stories, but for instance, one individual or clique within a neighborhood would dominate and push through something that, in the end, the neighborhood really didn&#8217;t support, or the neighborhood would waste a great deal of time trying to agree on what they meant by a community center.  So the AIA [American Institute of Architects ] and the National Urban League looked at where this [problem] had been addressed successfully.  There was a group in Harlem and a group in Philadelphia where architects and planners and other design people were working closely with neighborhood leaders as collaborative partners.  They developed a manual with a model Articles of Incorporation and a model for setting up what they called &#8220;community design centers,&#8221; and those had access to OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] funding.  At one time, there were many community design centers.  I think there were seventy-some in the country.  They all, initially, followed the same model that this design center [in Knoxville] still follows, and I understand from the current director that it&#8217;s one of the few in the country that still follows that model.  It has a board that&#8217;s made up of design professionals, general community leaders, and neighborhood grassroots leaders.  There&#8217;s a clich&#233; that you need the technical people to make you good, and the neighborhood people to make you right, and the community leaders to make you keep going.  [Laughs] That was the motto: One keeps you smart, one keeps you right, and one keeps you going.  By the time this Design Center was formed, the OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity] funding had dried up.  The Design Center&#8217;s initial funding was through a HUD [US Department of Housing and Urban Development] grant for a specific project. It was to help the Fort Sanders neighborhood, which is adjacent to the University, oppose a redevelopment project by developing an alternative plan.  That was their first project.  JF:  What was the makeup of the Fort Sanders neighborhood?  AA:  The neighborhood organization?  JF:  Yeah, like the demographics of the neighborhood.  AA:  Oh.  The organization leadership were a mixture of faculty [University of Tennessee, Knoxville] who had bought houses in that neighborhood, older people who had grown up in that neighborhood, and a few people from Epworth ministry.  It was predominantly middle class, I&#8217;d say, and for the usual reasons, they didn&#8217;t want a large part of the neighborhood cleared.  They wanted to try to keep it the way it was, which at that time was predominantly older residential structures.  I often think it would be an interesting master&#8217;s degree project to go back to that redevelopment plan and try to do some evaluation of whether the neighborhood actually benefited by defeating the redevelopment plan, because they did [defeat it], but then there was never either the spirit or the ability for the neighborhood to take the lead in developing it as it changed.  I haven&#8217;t done research on this, but I would guess that much of the neighborhood that has since been cleared by the hospitals and the University would have been cleared by the public agency if they had implemented the redevelopment plan and they might have been done it a with better quality design than the University or the hospitals. Anyway, that was the first project.   JF:  What were the biggest lessons you took away from that first project?  AA:  Well, actually, I wasn&#8217;t involved in that.  That was before I went there.  JF:  Okay.  AA:  That was the first two years of the Design Center&#8217;s life, and that was the period in which the Design Center was more involved with Epworth ministry than it was [later]. By the time I took the job, that report had been finished.  We later had some small projects with that same neighborhood group, but it didn&#8217;t have the kind of support or energy that it had had in fighting City Hall. Fighting City Hall always generates more energy that initiating community change does.  The mission of the Design Center was and is to create better communities by design, and in my years there, we routinely had on the books maybe twenty projects, urban and rural.  We served a sixteen-county area.  Always the clients were a group that demonstrated to our board&#8217;s satisfaction that it didn&#8217;t have the resources to hire the kind of technical assistance they felt they needed, that they had a reasonable prospect of implementing the project if they had a plan that their neighborhood or community would lobby for, would support, and that they needed the Design Center&#8217;s assistance.  My job was to find the appropriate technical people who would be willing to partner with that community group and work out the project.  I took the job, as I&#8217;ve said, in the early &#8217;70s.  JF:  Were you hired on as the executive director?  AA:  Yeah.  I was the only person there then.  [Laughter]  JF:  The rest of the staff were volunteers and &#8211;?  AA:  Well, when I arrived, they had just received their first group of VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America] volunteers.  My predecessor, Bill Oliphant, a landscape architect, had worked with a woman &#8211; another person you might be interested in interviewing, Donna Netherland &#8211; and requested VISTAs to help staff the Community Design Center.  And by the time I arrived, they had just arrived; we arrived at about the same time.  And Donna Netherland, at that time, was their supervisor.  She had a paid staff position to supervise the VISTAs.  And I worked for twenty-two years there.  And altogether, I think we had well over a hundred VISTAs in the course of those twenty &#8211; well, we didn&#8217;t have them for the full twenty-two years, but in the course of about twenty years, we had usually about ten VISTAs.  So, I think we had &#8211; once we counted them up &#8211; maybe it was two hundred VISTAs.  We had a lot of VISTAs, usually eight or ten or twelve at a time.  JF:  Was that a successful relationship with VISTA?  AA:  Well, VISTA, as a volunteer organization, had its flaws, certainly, but it was a marvelous resource for the Design Center and for Knoxville.  I was reminded recently &#8211; one of the ex-VISTAs, David McCarthy, who now runs a Design Center in Salt Lake City, I think, sent out an email reminding everybody that it was thirty years ago that his great group came.  And I was reading the email list, looking at that.  They were &#8211; well, Jude Clark was one of the VISTAs, an architect.  Mostly they were just out of school, not yet licensed architects or landscape architects, but he later became director of design for the Parks and Conservation Department of the State of Kentucky.  Several VISTAs, who still come to parties here a lot &#8211; ex-VISTAs Don and Ruth Horton met as VISTAs and got married right here in this living room.  And she is a very important person, director of environmental reviews, or at least many environmental reviews, for Tennessee Valley Authority, and he is a very prominent architect with McCarty Holsaple McCarty, which is the prestige firm in Knoxville.  Glenn Richters is ex-VISTA who is a partner in an architectural firm now.  Rocky Wade was a senior official at HUD for many years.  They were bright people and they had wonderful experience here, and they were marvelous resources for this community.  JF:  How would you characterize the politics of the VISTA volunteers and the other student interns or volunteers that got involved in the early to mid &#8217;70s?  AA:  Just wonderfully optimistic and future-oriented, energetic, young people.  I don&#8217;t recall that any of them were political in the sense that they were active in a campaign or a political party, and I don&#8217;t think any of them, come to think of it, are now.  Colleen Hannon directs county research and planning for a big area of Colorado, which includes Leadville, Colorado.  Her husband is manager of the Forest Service and director of the San Juan National Forest in Colorado.  I&#8217;ve never done an analysis of all two hundred, and some of them were really crazy, but I would say as a group they&#8217;re just real community leaders wherever they are &#8211; the ones I know certainly are &#8211; but I don&#8217;t know of any of them that have been active politically.  JF:  What do you think the influence of the Civil Rights Movement was on the people involved in these kinds of pro bono work and community efforts?  AA:  I would guess that the architects and planners who worked with low-income neighborhood organizations had and have a very different perspective on African American and low-income communities in general, a greater respect.  I certainly know that the African American members of our board were highly respected, and I think that knowing them and having close contact with them, I&#8217;m sure, had a good impact on the other board members and on the VISTAs.  And it certainly did on me; I came to have a great deal of respect for some of the leaders in the African American community.  I can&#8217;t recall issues involving the Design Center itself that were focused specifically on civil rights issues.  That just wasn&#8217;t the nature of our work.  I think that, in this part of the country, the change in attitude among both the professional people and the VISTAs who worked with low-income rural communities was as significant as their work with low-income black communities.  Because I think that many people, until you&#8217;ve had an experience working with places like Marie Cirillo&#8217;s community in Clearfork Valley, are likely to dismiss those people as just the people who are left behind and couldn&#8217;t make it anywhere else.  And certainly, we came to have a great deal of admiration for the leaders of those communities.  JF:  Who were the leaders of those communities?  Were they educated?  AA:  No.  JF:  Were they women, men?  Poor?  Working class?  Farmers?  AA:  I would say more than fifty percent were women.  One of the things that we did toward the end of my tenure at the Design Center &#8211; let&#8217;s see, this is a roundabout way of getting into it.  It became, in the late &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, harder and harder to get support or grants for community-based projects.  Cities and counties were struggling, it seemed, with budgets more than they had in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, early &#8217;80s, and many communities that had good project proposals and good community support just couldn&#8217;t get local funding for a project.  JF:  Do you attribute that more to economic issues &#8211; the money wasn&#8217;t there &#8211; or changes in political leadership and goals?  AA:  I think changes in political leadership more.  So, we felt that one way to deal with that was to encourage those communities to learn ways of being their own developers, that is, through forming community-based development organizations, cooperatives, land trusts, just different ways of doing things.  And I received a Levi Strauss grant to go to a national training program conducted by the Development Training Institute, which conducted a yearlong &#8211; well, we weren&#8217;t there for a year, but a series of workshops over the course of the year on community-based economic development.  And then, the Design Center held a series of workshops here on community-based economic development.  And the people who came to those classes, I would say, were predominantly women.  This was only for women in rural areas &#8211; I mean clients in rural areas, not women.  But I would say that thinking back over the classes probably the majority were women.  JF:  What drew them?  What were the biggest concerns or inspirations and motivations for these women to embark on something that must have been quite different from anything &#8211;?  AA:  Well, I suppose the endless attempt to achieve some way of getting decent housing was a first motivation.  Of course, that&#8217;s not just a woman&#8217;s issue, but it&#8217;s an issue to which many women give a high priority.  Agricultural issues &#8211; a significant number were interested in ways that they could try to keep people in the farming business when it seemed to be more and more difficult to do that, and with some success.  I remember one agricultural group &#8211; we extended this, because of TDA [Tennessee Department of Agriculture] funding, to some groups in western North Carolina, and one of them started growing shitake mushrooms, which they were able to sell at the Asheville Farmers Market, which is a very large market and very successful.  But I would say housing was a primary concern.  JF:  What do you think these training institutes, about classes the training institute offered &#8211; what was the most valuable thing they offered the people who attended?  AA:  Well, I suppose the most valuable thing &#8211; in retrospect, I&#8217;m not sure that that whole program was a great success.  We had two great fallacies in our assumptions about doing community economic development training.  [Laughs] One was, in a way, I suppose, a success.  We had funding in each of the communities where we were recruiting participants.  We had funding &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t a great deal of funding; it was about the same as VISTA volunteers were getting &#8211; but funding for somebody from that community to attend the classes and to be a resource person for other people in that community who were taking the class or struggling with the lessons or something like that.  And they did, of course, because they were paid to do so, attend regularly and participate actively.  And then, of course &#8211; well, maybe not, we didn&#8217;t foresee this &#8211; they all got seemingly very good jobs doing something other than grassroots community-based development.  So, that was not our intention, but it did demonstrate what a little bit of useful information &#8211; how that can be pretty helpful.  But it didn&#8217;t do a great deal for the low-income community organizations in that area.  I suppose where people seemed to use the information successfully, the best part of it was simply to know that there were other ways of doing things, that if the local childcare center went out of business, you could start your own childcare center.  And logically, although this is never successful, if the local grocery store goes out of business, you could start a grocery co-op, a cooperative grocery store.  That doesn&#8217;t really work, but the concept that through cooperatives and through community-based economic development groups, through land trusts, you can do things a different way, I suppose they all learned that lesson.  Whether they were able to implement it in very low-income neighborhoods and communities without any support, for a person to dedicate themselves to it full-time, I think, is very doubtful.  That&#8217;s the missing ingredient.  It&#8217;s impossible even in middle-class neighborhoods to get the kind of continued dedication to a project that it takes to really make a business development work, whether it&#8217;s a daycare center or a grocery store or a housing development corporation.  And we didn&#8217;t have the answer to that, and very few places do.  I heard on NPR the other day that there is now &#8211; and this is national news &#8211; a very successful cooperative grocery store in Central City, St. Louis.  Well, there&#8217;s a successful cooperative here in Knoxville, but it has taken years and it is not a full-scale grocery store, as the one, evidently, in St. Louis is.  So, I think we were overly optimistic about what grassroots organizations in east Tennessee could do as developers.  Let&#8217;s see.  We also dabbled, the Design Center did, and with, I think, more long-range impact, in various urban design issues.  We did a major study in &#8211; I guess it must have been around 1980 of &#8211; we called it in the end &#8220;Inner Connections and Open Spaces,&#8221; but it was a study of how the transportation and open space system might be designed to facilitate better connections between downtown and neighborhoods, better use of downtown, including residential use of downtown, more energy-efficient and walkable and bikeable neighborhoods.  And although many of the things the Design Center worked on were years ahead of implementation, one of the Foundation Directors reminded me this morning &#8211; we went to an opening of the new transit center downtown, and Laurens Tullock, who directs the Cornerstone Foundation, was reminding me that such a transit center was proposed in the livability studies that we did, which was called &#8220;Inner Connections,&#8221; and that finally we had at least one.  And I think it had an impact.  Now, of course, part of the impact of the Design Center&#8217;s work was that we were recruiting as volunteers for projects the same people who, wearing different hats, were community leaders in other arenas.  So, things that they had a chance to talk about and think about with colleagues at the Design Center they carried into other aspects of their professional and political life.  JF:  So, it sounds like the Community Design Center was a bridge for a lot of different organizations and alliances?  AA:  I think it was.  Once I tried to figure out, just for our own effectiveness, why so many professionals &#8211; architects, planners, etcetera &#8211; were willing to volunteer on Design Center projects, what they got out of it, to help me do a better job of recruiting them.  And a surprising number of people that I interviewed about that said that it was their only chance to get together with other professionals and that they just enjoyed being there.  It was a common ground for them.  And so, when we had major urban design projects, like our livability studies, we did have people like leading architects and the director of the city&#8217;s community development department, the director of planning, come in planning charettes to work on these issues.  But, of course, they then met each other and talked with each other and went out for beer after the meetings.  And it broadened their perspective on community issues, as well as the community participants&#8217; perspectives.  JF:  From your perspective as director of this bridge organization, how would you characterize in Knoxville and the surrounding areas in the &#8217;70s the women&#8217;s movement?  Were there visible women&#8217;s groups and efforts to organize around women&#8217;s issues, or did it blend more in with other issues and other organizations?  AA:  Well, I was once on the board of and there was a Woman&#8217;s Center here.  The Woman&#8217;s Center was never a client of the Community Design Center, so there was no relationship between the Design Center and the women&#8217;s organization, except that I was on the board of the women&#8217;s organization.  And I think the only &#8211; well, let&#8217;s see.  One of our most frequent clients I referred to earlier before we started this, directly and indirectly, was a woman named Linda Caldwell.  Linda Caldwell is executive director and pretty well known.  She even talked at the national meetings of the Endowment for the Arts.  She&#8217;s fairly well known in arts and cultural planning groups.  And her organization tries to do community development and tourism development in a group of counties in the area of the Cherokee National Forest.  She&#8217;s a very impressive woman.  And, again &#8211; I don&#8217;t know exactly why, partly because of her, I suppose &#8211; many of the leaders of the community groups that we worked with through Linda were women or are women.  I suppose they still are; I&#8217;ve been retired for fifteen years, so I&#8217;m not current with any of these things.  But she helps groups develop things like museums and restoring old theaters, movie theaters, and turning them into performing arts centers, improving downtowns in that seven-county area that she works in.  And it does seem, recalling their projects, that many of those neighborhood leaders or community leaders were women.  So, that, I would say, is an area where development was fairly women-centered.  And certainly in the Clearfork Valley &#8211; Margaret [Gregg] probably mentioned to you the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange.  I don&#8217;t think the Design Center ever worked directly with the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, but many of the members of the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange were also active with some of Marie Cirillo&#8217;s groups.  You know the story of Marie Cirillo, probably, so I don&#8217;t think I need to &#8211;  JF:  Do you want to say a little bit about how you met her and your impressions of her and your relationship with her?  AA:  She was one of the first people &#8211; well, I guess maybe Margaret was one of the first people I met when we came to Knoxville.  There were a group of women &#8211; you&#8217;ve heard the story, I&#8217;m sure &#8211; who were Glenmary Sisters, who left the Glenmary Order to form a secular order called FOCIS [Federation of Communities in Service] and had a big house out on Sullivan Road given to them by the bishop of this diocese.  And they had a number of events there, parties, mostly just parties &#8211; for a number of years I went there every New Year&#8217;s Eve &#8211; discussion groups sometimes.  And Margaret lived there; a lot of the women lived there.  By that time, Marie had already moved to Clearfield, but she came to the house when they had these events.  I think that&#8217;s how I met Marie.  And then, when I went to the Design Center, she, of course, was one of the first to bring a project from one of the rural areas.  Up until that time, the Design Center had mostly just worked on the Fort Sanders Project.  So, she was perhaps the first to bring a rural project in to the board.  And I imagine that, over those twenty-two years, we always had a project from the Clearfork Valley.  She has been the leader in forming a number of community organizations there:  the land trust, the community development organization.  Her current project is &#8211; oh, golly, what do they call that now?  Bob and I just worked on it as volunteers a couple of years ago &#8211; the Eagan [Tennessee] Educational Institute.  And they&#8217;re all interconnected, although they have different &#8211; each has a specific focus.  The Design Center&#8217;s &#8211; the first project, the one we worked on almost from the day I started at the Design Center, was to provide technical assistance in developing a village well shelter.  At that time they had no public water system.  The local wells were often, frequently, in many cases, polluted by the strip mining.  And so, there were many people who couldn&#8217;t get water except to take milk jugs to a spring, a natural spring, fill the milk jugs and take them home with their water for the week or days.  So, Marie obtained a grant from the Presbyterian Church to drill a deep well so they could have a community well, actually a community spigot, but they called it a community well.  And so, what they needed was just a small building, a shelter, so that if people came in the rain, they could fill their jugs with some shelter and some landscaping around it.  So, I think that was the first project with Marie.  But then, after that, there were several daycare center designs and a health clinic and many affordable houses.  One of the biggest projects was a self-help housing project, which had both TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] and federal funding in it, on the first large land acquisition of the land trust.  As I said, my husband and I both volunteered fairly recently, about two years ago, on the site plan for the old Eagan School, which they have wonderfully restored as an educational center for the community.  And just several weeks ago, she [Marie] had a consultant from Boston.  One of the Glenmary Sisters had gone to the University of Boston and was back with a colleague from the Economics Department there. [Marie was] consulting with them on trying to develop some business plans for some projects.  And she asked me to come and meet with them and talk with them about their general development scheme.  And, interestingly enough, they were still using and had reprinted &#8211; I was astounded &#8211; a report that we did for them I guess in about &#8217;86.  They had used all the copies they had and had them reprinted, and that was the basis of the discussion that they were having with these consultants from Boston.  So, we have a continuing friendship and relationship.  It&#8217;s unfortunate that you don&#8217;t get to interview her, but you can admire or be jealous of, envy your partner.  JF:  [Laughs] Let me pause for just a second to skip to the next track.  [Recording ends at 58:12 and begins again at 58:55]  Annette Anderson:  One of [S&#248;ren] Kierkegaard&#8217;s books says, &#8220;Purity of heart is to will one thing.&#8221;  Well, Marie has purity of heart, [laughs] if that&#8217;s the measure.  She wills the success of the Clearfork Valley people.  Joey Fink:  One of the things I&#8217;m struck by as I do interviews with folks is when they talk about the circles that things seem to work in, that the social networks would overlap with the professional networks, and, as you talked about, the Community Design Center being  a bridge for people to get together, and how important it was for folks, not just the actual work they were doing, but the  social life and the relationships they formed.  How important was it for you moving here and getting involved with these folks?  Did you feel like you were part of a community or a larger social network of people that were likeminded in their professional and political views, but also just became friends and created a social network?  [Laughing] That was kind of a roundabout way to ask that question.  I apologize.  AA:  [Pause] That&#8217;s an interesting question.  I think because of my position at the Design Center, I was able, and I was fortunate to be able, to be one of those people who can put people in touch with each other.  And therefore, I developed a secondhand involvement in lots of things.  For instance, an odd quirk, we once at the Design Center had a series of small grants from the Levi Strauss Foundation.  And the then-director of the Levi Strauss Foundation, who has fairly recently died, wanted to renew a small local foundation that called itself The Community Foundation and wanted to make a real community foundation out of that little group.  I suppose they had $100,000 in assets, and they met once a year at the Country Club or something and gave out some little $5,000 and $1,000 grants to a number of groups that knew about them, and that was the end of their community foundation work.  So, Carroll Thrift decided that he could make a real community foundation out of them, and so he offered to give the Community Design Center a grant to develop a plan to meet with those people and develop a plan for their becoming the nucleus of a community foundation, and we did that.  By that time, our director of development, Darla Beverage, actually was the one who did most of the work, but she and I met with the board endlessly, and eventually they became a community foundation.  And I became, because of the role I had played in helping found it, a member of the first board and on their personnel committee to select the executive director.  And we hired Katherine Pearson.  Has that name popped up?  Katherine and I had known each other because she was the director at one time, or staff member, of a theater group called the Playgroup, which was housed at Epworth.  And we had, from time to time, at the Design Center hired some of the members of the Playgroup for various things that we needed doing to help subsidize the Playgroup.  And I had been chair of that board for a while and admired Katherine.  Anyway, we hired her to be the first director of the East Tennessee Foundation.  And then, I was able to ask David White &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know David White at that time, but he became the first chair of the East Tennessee Foundation, and so I met him in that way.  Well, that got me for years very much involved with the East Tennessee Foundation, which then gave grants to groups that became clients of the Community Design Center.  And because I was on the Foundation board and also was a good friend of Katherine&#8217;s, I was able to get those groups in touch with Foundation people and other people who could help their cause.  So, I was involved on a secondhand basis with all of those groups for which the Design Center was a resource because of my contact with the Foundation.  That&#8217;s a long way around saying that, because of my position, I had lots of contacts and still value many those contacts.  But I don&#8217;t think I have many close friends among those contacts.  I&#8217;m trying to think.  I guess maybe &#8211; no.  Even Margaret and Marie are friends, but maybe it&#8217;s a time of life, as a matter of fact.  I think back when I was younger, especially when I was rearing children, I had friends with whom we exchanged confidences and I really felt close.  And now I have many more friends than I had when I was in my twenties or thirties, but no friends in the sense that those friends were close friends.  And still &#8211; we just came back from visiting Washington, DC, where one of Bob&#8217;s daughters lives.  That was the primary reason for being there, but we stayed with one of those people who was a friend of mine beginning back in Winston-Salem when I was just &#8211; oh, how long ago was that?  Fifty years ago, I guess, and other friends that we make an effort to keep in touch with.  So, no, I don&#8217;t think that the overlapping of my professional and social contacts, which are wonderful and which I value, but they have not led to what I would call close friendships.  And that may be just a different time of life.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been happier than I am right now, so I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m feeling deprived.  But your question made me realize, maybe, that there&#8217;s a big difference in the way I feel about people I&#8217;m close to now and the way I felt when I was in my twenties and thirties.  Maybe I was needier then.  That could be.  JF:  Do you think maybe it also would have to do with the difference between working and not working?  AA:  No, I don&#8217;t think so.  JF:  How would you, thinking back from your graduate experience in Kansas City, where you couldn&#8217;t get into certain rooms or participate with the men in retreats, to let&#8217;s say by the end of the &#8217;70s, early &#8217;80s, where you&#8217;re moving in a lot of different professional circles and helping to connect people together, and a lot of the names you&#8217;re mentioning are women &#8211; whether by coincidence or intent, a lot of these women are moving into leadership roles  &#8211; how would you explain that change over those years for women who are seeking higher education or professional experiences?  AA:  I&#8217;m thinking that, as one of your questions implied, when I was not able to work in the city&#8217;s Department of Research and Budget, there were no models.  There were no examples of people at high levels in the city administration at that time.  There were, as I said, the woman in the City Planning Department, who was at a senior level, but it was in research.  It wasn&#8217;t an outreach or community &#8211; a visible position, even in that department.  I&#8217;m thinking &#8211; a woman who was a friend of mine in Louisville died recently.  And her husband &#8211; she had been writing a memoir over some years, and her husband sent that out in chapters to some of her friends.  So, I&#8217;ve been reading it over the last few weeks, although it covered fifty years or more of her life.  And she said at one time she had to &#8211; she went to graduate school in social work and eventually taught at American University in Washington, DC, and was very successful in her field.  And when she first went to graduate school, she did so just because she realized that &#8211; or she thought that &#8211; her husband wasn&#8217;t going to be able to support the family in a style in which they would like to live, and that eventually she would need to go to work, and she didn&#8217;t want to just go be a clerk in a department store, so she slowly started working on a graduate degree.  And she said then that probably at that time she should have thought about divorce, because her marriage wasn&#8217;t &#8211; this is in her memoir; she had remarried by the time she was writing it &#8211; the marriage wasn&#8217;t successful, and it was just very hard for her to even afford to hire the babysitters to take one or two classes each semester, and it was going to take her forever, which it was, for her to get her graduate degree that way.  But she looked around her and she didn&#8217;t know anybody, couldn&#8217;t see anybody, who was living alone and trying to rear children by herself.  And she just &#8211; at that time, which must have been by that time the early [19]60s, she just couldn&#8217;t imagine how she could do it, because nobody was doing it.  And so, she certainly couldn&#8217;t be the first, among all the people she knew, to try to be a single mother.  I think that was an important part of it.  I think that everywhere there were some women who had somehow the combination of guts and luck to begin to break away from their traditional ways of living, whether that was in professional jobs or whether it was just working at what you could do and doing it on your own, rather than being dependent upon a husband.  But I can remember in the [19]50s and, in Martha&#8217;s case, the early [19]60s, I couldn&#8217;t &#8211; thinking back &#8211; I was her neighbor in Louisville &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t think of anybody that we knew who was divorced.  You just didn&#8217;t do that.  At least, not in Louisville, Kentucky, you didn&#8217;t do it.  So, I think that was an important aspect.  We&#8217;re celebrating now the ninetieth anniversary of the women&#8217;s right to vote, and that took about ninety years to get to that point.  We&#8217;re now ninety years beyond that point.  There&#8217;s still a lot to be done.  But if you look back at how long it took for us just to get the right to vote &#8211; culture changes very slowly.  Sometimes I ask myself: why in the world, when I couldn&#8217;t get the internship that the men in my class [could], why didn&#8217;t I protest?  Why didn&#8217;t I go to the president of the university and say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t do this.&#8221;?  It never occurred to me.  And if I knew who the president was, I can&#8217;t imagine what his response would be.  It certainly wouldn&#8217;t have been, &#8220;You&#8217;re right.&#8221;  But it never occurred to me to do that, just as it never occurred to Martha, my friend who died, when she knew in [19]61 or so, that it was time to get a divorce.  She couldn&#8217;t do it, or she felt she couldn&#8217;t, until her children were out of the house.  I&#8217;m trying to think whether anything I did or felt was directly affected by the so-called Equal Rights or Women&#8217;s Rights movement, and I&#8217;m sure it was, even though I was never &#8211; except for being on the board of the Women&#8217;s Center, I was never directly involved in that.  But I think that people articulating what many of us had felt for years, and saying it publicly, was probably very important.  JF:  You were involved with the League of Women Voters?  Is that right?  AA:  I am.  JF:  You still are?  AA:  Um-hmm.  JF:  What&#8217;s your relationship with that organization been like?  What do you like about it?  AA:  Oh, I have had many positions.  I&#8217;m not on the board right now.  I&#8217;m on some committees and do some work, significant amount of work with them.  My interest in government was my first interest that led me into public administration that led me into city planning.  And I think the effort to increase and inform the electorate is perhaps the most important issue before our country.  I mean it&#8217;s just incredible the misinformation and the degree to which we&#8217;ve become a country divided in so many ways &#8211; economically, politically.  It&#8217;s really frightening.  I&#8217;m frightened by the environmental mess we&#8217;ve gotten into, but I&#8217;m more frightened, I think, by the electorate mess we&#8217;ve gotten into.  The rancor, the &#8211; it&#8217;s frightening.  Bob and I were talking the other night.  I think that if Obama put his mind to it, he could out-Beck Glenn Beck.  He&#8217;s such an articulate and persuasive intelligent man.  He could do what FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt] was able to do in his fireside chats better than FDR, but what would be his medium?  When FDR gave his fireside chats, there was only one medium, effectively.  People listened to the radio, and that was it.  And so, he could speak to everybody, and they all heard the same story.  Now, I don&#8217;t know where Obama would speak to obtain an audience, really.  Certainly, I guess he does give radio talks.  I&#8217;ve never listened to one.  But it&#8217;s not the radio, it&#8217;s not commercial TV.  Maybe it&#8217;s the Internet, but I don&#8217;t think so.  And so, civil discourse depends, I think, on people at least sharing information.  We don&#8217;t have the same information to begin a discourse in today&#8217;s electoral environment.  Some people believe what they hear from Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh as news.  Other people believe what they read from AlterNet or some of the media reports that are news also.  But they don&#8217;t have the same facts to discuss, so it&#8217;s very hard to have a civil discourse about anything.  I think that&#8217;s very frightening.  JF:  I really appreciate your comment that culture changes very slowly.  AA:  It does.  [Laughs]  JF:  It&#8217;s so apparent when you look back at history.  AA:  Yeah.  JF:  And yet there are also these turning points where you see the culmination of years of work: like the Civil Rights Act or Title IX in 1974.  I&#8217;m wondering if you could just speak on &#8211; you&#8217;ve been a resident of eastern Tennessee since the late [19]60s and a resident of this neighborhood since 1975?  AA:  Um-hmm.  JF:  What kind of cultural changes have you seen in this region, or not seen, since you&#8217;ve been here?  And how do you think this has affected people doing the kind of work that you&#8217;ve dedicated the past thirty years of your life to: community building and empowering citizens and promoting communications and relationships between diverse groups of people?  AA:  [Pause] Well, I imagine in the late [19]60s, Knoxville was about twenty years behind Chicago, say, the national norm, an ordinary place, and I think it probably still is.  So, if there&#8217;s been change, I think it&#8217;s been American change, not Appalachian change.  I&#8217;m not a great optimist about significant change in east Tennessee.  In some ways [pause] we didn&#8217;t do a lot of the things that other places did that shouldn&#8217;t have been done in the first place.  We didn&#8217;t do as much redevelopment.  We did redevelopment; we didn&#8217;t do as much as less fortunate places.  We haven&#8217;t given African Americans as much of a leadership role, as a community as a whole, as other places have.  But, on the other hand, I don&#8217;t think we have had as much hate and distrust and meanness as some other places have had.  We certainly haven&#8217;t done as well as many places in design.  We&#8217;re not doing as well as many places in environmental protection.  But maybe when change comes here, as in Clearfork Valley, or maybe any place in Appalachia, it takes hold more permanently than it does in some other places.  But it sure is hard to change things here.  My husband&#8217;s most recent frustration is he&#8217;s chair of the neighborhood traffic committee, and the speed limit in this neighborhood is 30 miles an hour.  And the city has a Safe Neighborhoods program where they put up a sign at the entrances to the neighborhood that says this is a quiet residential area and has some little symbols about protecting bicycles &#8211; bicycles are allowed, pedestrians are allowed, and then a 25-mile-an-hour speed limit.  Well, the traffic committee tried to get this neighborhood to become one of those safe neighborhoods and accept the 25-mile-an-hour speed limit.  And it was the topic of several very contentious neighborhood meetings, and they left things the way that it is.  Thirty miles an hour is good enough.  Maybe ten years from now, they might accept a change, but not now! It&#8217;s very hard to get real change here.    What I have considered, as I&#8217;ve said before, the impact of some of the ideas that were generated through the Community Design Center were not a project that you could point to and say, &#8220;This was done,&#8221; as you could, as we did with small-scale neighborhood projects, you could say, &#8220;That&#8217;s what we designed.&#8221;  But the slow impact of people who would not otherwise meet each other getting together and getting to know each other and then changing their roles in the community and carrying their attitudes that they learned, not from me or not from the Design Center, but from each other, into different roles in the community, if that brings change, then that&#8217;s a real change instead of a superficial change, like the city does something.  But it&#8217;s very frustrating to try to be an agent of that change.  JF:  Well, is there anything you thought I would ask you that I didn&#8217;t ask, or anything you&#8217;d like to add?  AA:  No, no.  No, I can&#8217;t think of anything right now.  I think, as I said earlier, that one of the greatest benefits to east Tennessee of the Design Center was simply bringing in so many VISTAs, many of whom stayed in east Tennessee or took leadership roles in design-related fields.  I&#8217;m a very strong advocate for some kind of required national service so that people would have something like VISTA or some other community service activity as part of their lives, because I think it changed the VISTA&#8217;s life, it changed my life, and it was important for the community.  But that was discontinued, or largely discontinued.  They still have it, but it&#8217;s a very different program now.  I can&#8217;t think of &#8211; if you want me to look up Linda Caldwell, if you want me to look up any telephone numbers &#8211; I would suggest Gideon Fryer, and a good way to do that would be to go to one of his Friday night gatherings.  And I think Linda Caldwell might be a good contact, too.  JF:  Well, thank you very much.  AA:  You&#8217;re welcome.  JF:  I really do appreciate your sharing your time and your stories with us.  AA:  You&#8217;re most welcome.  It&#8217;s been long, hasn&#8217;t it?  Wow!
