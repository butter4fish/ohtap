Evan Faulkenbury: Today is July 25, 2013. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m here in Chapel Hill, North Carolina interviewing Jill Edens from the United Church of Chapel Hill. Thank you again for sitting with me. The first thing I want to ask about is about your childhood and growing up in Ohio.
Jill Edens: I was born in 1952 so I&#8217;m part of the post-war boom. My father served in the Seabees in the Pacific, Midway Island, and came back in 1947and married my mother. My sister was born right away in 1948, and then I was born in 1952. I&#8217;m the middle of three sisters. We lived on the west side in an inner suburb, very much a working class suburb, in the inner western ring of suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio. My father was a mechanical engineer, and he was part owner of a high pressure die cast company. So he designed the dies and the parts, and they manufactured them for, oh, all kinds of small machines and automobiles and things like that. This was a real boom time in Cleveland, so my memory of Cleveland is as being a very busy--and polluted, but those things went together--place. I grew up in the Parma city school district my whole life, so I had an extremely stable childhood. Looking back and knowing people, it&#8217;s one of the great things about my life, that we didn&#8217;t move, and I had lots of family around. My life was informed by lots of caring relatives and a stable neighborhood and a stable school experience, so I feel, in retrospect, very lucky for that experience in the 1950s.         In the 1960s life for everyone in Cleveland really underwent a series of dislocations. Civil rights was upon the world and certainly upon Cleveland. Cleveland was a sector city and maybe to some degree still is. Parma at the time, I believe, was the largest un-integrated in the whole United States. If it hadn&#8217;t been a suburb of Cleveland, it would have been one of the largest cities in Ohio, so it was a suburb of probably over a hundred thousand people, almost entirely white. Everyone on my street was pretty much from Eastern Europe and had fled for various reasons after World War II. Our family was among the only families on that street where English was our first language, so most of my friends had some other first language like Ukrainian or Slovakian or something like that [Polish], and many of them went to parochial schools. I think we were also the only Protestant family that we knew. That actually was good because at the time you don&#8217;t think about it, but it really gave me a very solid identity of what it meant to be different and what it meant to be Protestant.         We were very active in our church, and our church was very activist. It was surprising because a German ethnic congregation you wouldn&#8217;t think of as being terribly activist, but it was, and in many churches people were flummoxed by the violence that came with civil rights. The Hough Riots happened [in 1966] before I was in high school. I can&#8217;t tell you the date of the riots, but I can tell you that this became a divide for everyone who lived in Cleveland because Cleveland really became a war zone. Whole neighborhoods were burned down; the National Guard was brought in; things were really destabilized; there was a lot of fear-mongering, especially in the white community. It was really one of those moments where, as a young person--I must have been seventh or eighth grade--your impression was that if you even brought up the issue of race that everything would be burned down because you didn&#8217;t have any other way of thinking about it, and no one had really talked about it, at least in my life, outside of church. And the church did talk about it, but the schools didn&#8217;t, and there wasn&#8217;t any way of putting a frame around the violence that was going on in the city.         At that same time my mother was going back to work, and she was trying to get certified as an elementary school teacher. It was a great moment for that reason because she came into her own and she became--I had very good parents--but she really became a role model for me of a woman who fought to have her own life and her own profession in a very conservative place. And [she] had to carve that out herself, although my dad and her parents were very supportive, but the west side of Cleveland was a very conservative town. So she did. She got her cadet certificate, and she started teaching in the Cleveland public schools and became one of the first teachers to be moved as a result of the desegregation of Cleveland public schools [in the 1970s]. She had been teaching on the west side, and she [became] the only white teacher in an all-African American school in the middle of a federal housing project on the east side. She marched right in there and did that and taught. But then, in the middle of the year, she was held up at gun point in her room, and fortunately whoever did it only grabbed her purse and didn&#8217;t harm her or any of the children. When she came home, she was obviously just--. She had--what is it?--PTSD. She had all kind of traumatic shock from it. But what she kept saying, what I remember, was, &#8220;Well, I couldn&#8217;t protect the children,&#8221; but the truth is she did protect the children because no one was harmed, and the worst that happened was this guy got her purse.         But because of the trauma of that experience and the fact that the school itself was not happy--she felt unsupported as the only white teacher in the school--the Cleveland Teachers Union went to bat for her, and she got six months off with pay--I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s right--from the schools. And then she was relocated into an integrated school, but not in a school where she would be the lone white teacher. She did go back to work, and she worked for the rest of her career in the Cleveland schools. So she, in my growing up, was a real profile in courage. She faced a very difficult situation that was really violent. There was violence everywhere against everyone, and I&#8217;m sure there were plenty of black teachers who were equally threatened and harmed and people who lost loved ones in the middle of that violence in Cleveland. So now I feel lucky that at least no one that I knew was injured or killed in the middle of that, and that my mother was not destroyed by it, but that she continued to work and was very loyal to the Cleveland schools and the work that they were doing.         So that was my junior high experience, and then high school became dominated by the Vietnam War. So growing up when I grew up, everything was in turmoil, but in some ways, in very formative ways, that set the table for the rest of what we did in school. I finished at Parma Senior High School and went to Wittenberg University--now I can&#8217;t believe I went there, but I went there really because my boyfriend went there--in Springfield, Ohio, and at the time I don&#8217;t think there was even a thoroughfare. Eventually I-71went to Springfield, so it was not in the boonies, but at first it really was like a seven-hour drive from Cleveland to go to Wittenberg, the middle of nowhere. It was a small, moderate to conservative Lutheran school, although the faculty was just terrific, as probably was true of faculties across the United States. They did things that were very enlivening, and for the first time in my life--. I was in AP history and I had an excellent teacher who began to frame the upheavals in American society in a way that I could understand, and then that continued at Wittenberg.         So that was a wonderful, formative time of beginning to put my experience in context and to think about what role I wanted to play in society as I was trying to become a professional. Because of my mother&#8217;s influence on me, I decided I wanted to be a school teacher because I couldn&#8217;t imagine anything more exciting or important to do. So I did become a certified teacher, graduating from Wittenberg, and I did teach as a student teacher in the Springfield schools. Springfield, Ohio remains a depressed former manufacturing place, a lot of people in poverty, many more black and white folks--. It was a more diverse population than where I had grown up. So it was interesting, and actually I was mentored by excellent teachers, considering where this was. Now I look back and I think, &#8220;Gosh, those were really hardworking and enlightened, caring professionals that trained me in teaching.&#8221;         I graduated in 1973, and it&#8217;s hard to believe now but it was the great teacher glut. There were way too many teachers. A lot of people had gone to school to get teaching degrees to avoid the war, so there were professions that were overwhelmed with practitioners because people would be able to get, like for divinity school, a IV-D. I don&#8217;t know what it was called for teachers. Then at that point there was the lottery, so the war was starting to wind down. Well, the long and short of it was I had been a very good student my whole life, had always gotten everything I wanted, and then couldn&#8217;t get a job, which just shocked me. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. But God works in a mysterious way. I got a job in a church in Hamden, Connecticut, the Spring Glen United Church of Christ, and they hired me to be a director of Christian education, which was pretty far afield from anything I thought I would be doing. But it was education related, they were willing to pay me, I did have a strong church background so I guess it made some [sense]. And I was working for next to nothing, but nonetheless, I probably was worth next to nothing. I mean, I was only twenty-one years old at the time.         So I did that work in that church, and it was right on the doorstep of Yale Divinity School and lots of the parishioners were somehow related to the faculty of the divinity school or with the life of the church in Connecticut, so I really landed in such a formative place. One of the professors there--his name is Jim Dittes and he&#8217;s since died--said, &#8220;Have you ever considered the ministry?&#8221; I was stunned when he said it because I had never seen a woman minister in my life. I didn&#8217;t know women could be ministers. Then I started going over to Yale and attending their chapel services, and I met the dean of the divinity school, the dean of admissions, who was an ordained woman, so I talked to her. I submitted my application there, terrified, and actually got in on an early admission and turned it down. I was so freaked out by the idea that I would try to blaze that kind of trail. So they said, &#8220;That&#8217;s okay, we can--.&#8221; What do they call that when you set aside your admission but you can still--?        EF: Deferring.        JE: I deferred it, yes. So I deferred my admission, I continued to work at the church, then I got to know more and more women who were students there, and I did the math and figured out that my church--. And my church was supportive, so I could work there half-time, and I could go to school, and I could figure out how to pay for all that. Life was different then. So I did, and I house-sat for parishioners, so there were ways to figure it out.         Now I look back and think, &#8220;Well, what a fortunate turn of events&#8221; because everything I learned in divinity school I could immediately apply to the work I was doing in the church and test it against whether [I could] really be a parish minister, [or is] divinity school too far afield from what I really have to do, and I&#8217;m grateful to that church. So I soldiered through and paid for it all. I think I graduated with maybe two thousand dollars in debt, which was a lot of money in 1978, but it was very doable and it wasn&#8217;t like the kind of indebtedness that students have now, and I had then a pretty good r&#233;sum&#233; because I had a real job. I had been serving in real educational ministry in a church all that time and then working towards ordination. Now that became a good thing and a difficult thing.         So, I met Rick. I had gone off for an internship in Lakewood, Ohio so I spent a whole year as basically director of Christian education, but I did it under the auspices of the divinity school, so that was another feather in my cap. So now I had several churches I could point to as having had [some] experience. I also developed a newsletter for Christian educators during that time, so it was a productive time. I met Rick in what would then be my fourth year because he&#8217;d also done an internship. So there we were, about a dozen of us, returning to Yale. Everyone we knew had already graduated because we&#8217;d done this extra year of internship, so it was easy to get to know who&#8217;s left because there weren&#8217;t that many of us. He was so friendly, but what I realized--. It was a funny courtship because all these women, in my mind, were throwing themselves at him because it&#8217;s the last year and everyone&#8217;s getting panicky.        EF: [Laughs] Got to get a ring by spring.        JE: Yeah, you got to get a ring, and not only that. I mean this is 1978. You could not enter the parish ministry, or it would be extremely difficult for you to get a job as an unmarried pastor, and women had a harder time overall than men. Well we fell in love and knew we wanted to get married, [and] Rick had interned as UCC [United Church of Christ] and I had interned as UCC, but we panicked and decided the Methodist system could handle us better. The long and short of that was we did that year with the Wisconsin Conference and they were really good to us. It [had] a good bishop, but [we] realized that we were a different cut of cloth and it was better to be who we were and take our chances. The UCC is riskier; it&#8217;s very much an entrepreneurial, you&#8217;re-on-your-own kind of system. You don&#8217;t get very much protection from the conference. They&#8217;re there as a support but they don&#8217;t really have very much authority, so every pastor&#8217;s on his or her own to negotiate whatever their ministry&#8217;s going to be with that local parish. So, as I told you in the first interview, Rick really did not like Wisconsin. He was okay with being a Methodist, but he did not&#8212;[like the cold]. He was from the South; it was a terrible winter; he was not going to live there anymore; he was pacing around all the time.        EF: Can I pause you and can you go back and explain a bit more about what brought you to Wisconsin and the church that you were at?        JE: Right. So we had both been getting dual credentialing through both the UCC and the United Methodist Church. And I had been on the German side, the Evangelical United Brethren Church, in Cleveland, so I was working my own way through there and then transferred--you don&#8217;t need to know all this--to the New York Conference. Rick, Southern Methodist, and--I only understood this later--. Like everything in the United States, the states of the old confederacy are different, and they&#8217;re different in every respect. They&#8217;re different in political life, and in the life of schools and universities, and they&#8217;re different in the life of churches. So nearly every church that had a presence in the states of the old confederacy split during the Civil War. So you had Northern Presbyterians and you had Southern Presbyterians, and you had Northern Methodists, and you had Central Jurisdiction Methodists, and you had Southern. I don&#8217;t know any more how that all played out, but for a Northerner, the Southern Methodist church had its own flavor, like everything in the South does.         Well, Rick had grown up in that so he actually did pretty well with it. He grew up in Charlotte; he grew up in a great big suburban church; he had excellent mentoring. The DS [District Superintendent] there was very supportive of him; but Rick has always been his own man, and he&#8217;s never been willing to fall into lockstep with what everybody else is doing. Well, had he been really wanting to return to North Carolina--and he could have had a bright future in the Methodist church here--he should have gone to Duke. I mean, and that&#8217;s not unusual. Like if you want to have a good path and you&#8217;re UCC in New England, you probably ought to go to Yale or to Andover Newton. There are feeder schools, there are churches around those schools who know what the product is, and they&#8217;re loyal to those schools, and they support them, and they&#8217;re fed by them. So by going to Yale, Rick found himself on the outside looking in, in the Western [North Carolina] Conference of the Methodist Church.         Then at the same time, and this was a great thing, the Methodist Church started to desegregate, so the Central Jurisdiction I&#8217;m pretty sure got broken up, and then they were pushing the open itinerancy for black and white people and for men and women. The Methodist Church in those days was breathtakingly progressive and way ahead of everybody else, so if you were a woman in the ministry and you were competent and you had jumped through all the hoops, you were pretty much guaranteed what I would call a &#8220;tenured job&#8221; in those days. So once you get granted first deacon&#8217;s and then elder&#8217;s orders, you had a job for life, and that bishop would find you a job. What the Methodists did was remarkable.         It was in the middle of that that Rick and I were trying to assess our opportunities in the ministry, and it was a good strategic decision, especially for a woman, to say, &#8220;You know what? The United Methodists are light years ahead of everybody else. Let&#8217;s just do this and let the bishop figure it out.&#8221; And we did. So the Northern Methodists were way more liberal and more excited about women than the Western Conference of North Carolina, which was not entirely conservative. Rick was relating to a District Superintendent who was quite open and excited about us, but the bishop, who was from an older and more conservative bent, he was not willing to appoint us. He didn&#8217;t want anything to do with clergy couples, and he said that. He said, &#8220;I have four. I don&#8217;t want any more. I can&#8217;t appoint you; it&#8217;s just more than this conference can handle.&#8221; Anyway, so we went with the Wisconsin conference because that bishop actually recruited us and wanted us, and it was all right.         But going back to North Carolina, my husband hates the snow and he wants to live in the South, and we&#8217;re a clergy couple and we&#8217;re realizing, even in Wisconsin, really pretty liberal compared to the mainstream of churches, but not too liberal for the UCC. So that became clear to us, that we probably had made the right choice while we were at Yale, that we were really aligned with the United Church of Christ and we wouldn&#8217;t find a lot of potholes along the road trying to be in that church. So anyway, I told Rick something that we laugh about now. I said, &#8220;If you can find a UCC church in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; thinking there is no way, that there probably isn&#8217;t a church in Chapel Hill because the Congregationalists were abolitionists so they were pretty much banned from the Confederacy. There are some here that are old O&#8217;Kelly-ite Christians, that&#8217;s another long story, but they tend to be moderate to conservative country churches. So I thought, &#8220;He can knock himself out looking for a church; this is not going to happen, and we&#8217;ll just stay in Wisconsin&#8221; because the winter didn&#8217;t bother me as much as it bothered him.         So he goes home and he&#8217;s got the listing for the UCCs, [laughs] and there is an open church in Chapel Hill. I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this is happening to me.&#8221; [Laughs] So he&#8217;s on the phone. He wasted no time, talked to the conference down here, and they were so sweet. Like I said, there are a lot of moderate to conservative churches and people, but there&#8217;s a real sweetness down here that you really come to love. The guy he talked to, who probably could not imagine a clergy couple, now that I know how old he was and what the conference looked like, but he was so sweet and he said, &#8220;You know, if I were a young man, what do you have to lose? I think I&#8217;d submit my r&#233;sum&#233;. Go ahead,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to&#8221; because he was the gatekeeper.         What we didn&#8217;t know--and I think God does work in a mysterious way--the church had been in a search for a year, year and a half, they had called someone, they thought they were finished and all set to install a new pastor, and that person pulled out. I don&#8217;t know who it was or why they pulled out, but it all fell apart and they were really crushed. It&#8217;s very hard on a small church when that happens. They have to put their search back together and they have to find the wherewithal to keep going. We did not know that when we called in, so we get a call right away, which pretty much surprised us. Here are two people who are twenty-seven years old, who have one year of experience, going into a church that had had pretty good relationships with their pastors. The last pastor had been there like eleven years. He was in his late thirties and he was quite accomplished. He&#8217;d gone to Connecticut to a big church. I didn&#8217;t even think they&#8217;d talk to us. I was surprised. But they did, they called us right up and said, &#8220;We want to talk to you.&#8221; So we came down and first interviewed them, and one of the members of the search committee said, &#8220;Oh, we did this, but I never really took you seriously.&#8221; I can&#8217;t believe they even said this, but they did. So we had a very pleasant round of interviews, talked to them about the church, went home and sort of forgot about it, and got another call. They said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really serious now.&#8221; [Laughs]         Oh, the other thing about the first interview--this was in March of 1979--they called and changed the first interview. Remember, we&#8217;re booking tickets to fly to North Carolina, and they&#8217;ve now decided to change the date because there&#8217;s going to be a basketball game. I told Rick, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m done. I will not serve a church that is so shallow that they would change an interview date with a potential pastor because there was a basketball game,&#8221; and because Rick was from here he went, &#8220;No! No! You have no idea! It&#8217;s March Madness. You&#8217;ve got to let this go.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Now I have less respect for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe this!&#8221;         EF: [Laughs]        JE: But anyway, I let it go and we went. So then they were really hot to trot and they really wanted to talk to us, so they called us right back. That&#8217;s when they told us, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t really take you very seriously, but we&#8217;re really serious now and we&#8217;d like you to fly back,&#8221; so we did, and they offered us the job then at that point. So we both worked. I mean, oh, my gosh. I can&#8217;t believe we did this. So we&#8217;d been both fully paid, very nice situation, really nice, in Wisconsin, [a] large, wealthy church, fully benefited and everything. We came down here and we both worked for one salary, and I made the mistake a lot of Yankees make, which is, &#8220;Oh well, it will be so much cheaper to live in the South. We&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; Well, it was more expensive to live in Chapel Hill than where we were living in Wisconsin, so the first year was grim. I mean, the whole budget of the church in 1979 when we accepted that call I think was forty-three thousand dollars, and that was not a lot of money then.        EF: That&#8217;s everything?        JE: That was everything. That was their cost for the building and the heat, the secretary, the musician, us; forty-three thousand dollars. Our cut of that, and I can&#8217;t believe we agreed to this, was like thirteen thousand dollars, twelve or thirteen thousand dollars--I still have that contract--for both of us, and that thirteen thousand dollars included our pension payment and our health, so we were really in trouble. We&#8217;d made a bad bargain, we couldn&#8217;t live here on that, I didn&#8217;t have much in the way of loans but Rick did, and the first year I said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to leave. We just can&#8217;t do this.&#8221;         But fortunately for us, the church [then felt] a lot like it does now. It&#8217;s a lot bigger but there was a lot of goodwill. This is a community that&#8217;s in the business of dealing with twenty-somethings, so there was a lot of compassion for us, even though I think they were happy they&#8217;d driven such a good deal. They didn&#8217;t have much money either and they were panicked about their future. Well, then the church started to grow and do a lot better and so the next year and the years after they really were great. They increased the money and they were supportive of our work, and now when I think about it, to come as a twenty-seven-year-old couple--and we were so doctrinaire--we divided everything down the middle. Each of us preached an equal amount of time, we got paid exactly equally, and they were so supportive and sweet about it. In those days, my gosh, that would have been nutty. I was the only woman in a preaching position in all of Chapel Hill.        EF: Yeah! Talk about that next, about being the first or one of the first female pastors in the area.        JE: There was only one other white [clergy woman]. Now, black churches have always had women who were preachers, but for the white churches in Chapel Hill, the first one was Carol Ripley-Moffitt, who had been called by Binkley Baptist Church to be their Christian [education] minister, so there were three people on that staff. There was a senior pastor, a youth minister, and then Christian [education], so hers was not a preaching position. Binkley was way bigger than United Church then. United Church had probably a half-dozen kids in the Sunday school; it was so small. They had seventy-five to eighty people in worship on Sundays. It was a really small congregation. So we&#8217;re making it up as we went, as was the church.         So here&#8217;s a church that had a very stable male presence every Sunday, very traditional look to it, and now they&#8217;ve got this clergy couple who are doing every other Sunday and want to try out everything. So we hired a male church secretary. [Laughs] There was a little grumbling but it was all right. They didn&#8217;t make too big a fuss over it. But still when I think about it they were amazingly supportive of this young couple who really was wanting to try everything in the world.         So, yeah, so during the 1980s the church grew a lot and we grew into two full-time positions, thanks to the growth and the vitality of the congregation, and then we got so big that we had to start talking about how are we going to manage being downtown. That really became the Holy Grail. That was the very toughest conflict of the ministry. All that time, we had the IFC in our building. The Interfaith Council, with social services, was in United Church&#8217;s building all that time, and the Chapel Hill Daycare Center was in the building, so they were very mission-minded and really had gotten out there with mission on a very small shoestring, and they also helped start the men&#8217;s shelter. Men were sleeping on the fellowship hall floor while the church is lobbying the town to give over the jail--which is where it is now, the old town building--so that we could create a real shelter for the homeless there. So think about the chutzpah of this little congregation, what they were doing. It&#8217;s amazing.         EF: It was. Can you back up a little bit more and talk a bit about when you first came here and how you got involved? The Interfaith Council I know had preceded you, but [discuss] how you both became involved and how instrumental that was.        JE: Yeah. The Interfaith Council of course was sitting in our building, and we were gung-ho. Urban ministry was what the two of us were all about. This is really what we wanted to emphasize in our ministry, and fortunately the church saw itself as a downtown ministry and very much interested in this, so we didn&#8217;t have a lot of conflict over mission ever. They were always interested in it, and they had been way ahead of us in starting the daycare center and housing the Interfaith Council, which then did not have any housing or feeding programs. It was basically set up like the PTA thrift shop, so they had clothing and they gave away what they called &#8220;loans and grants&#8221; for people, but they did not actually want to get into direct services. They were very much opposed to that.         EF: Right.        JE: Well, Rick and I were living over in Carrboro, and we&#8217;re driving in to church every day, and there next to the KFC there are always people in the dumpster eating, there are always people sleeping in the laundromat, and we couldn&#8217;t believe it. In a town as &#8220;liberal and wealthy&#8221; as Chapel Hill, [we were surprised] that people were simply accepting that there were destitute people all over the place. They were sleeping in the hospital lobby. It was awful. So actually, the police chief of Carrboro, Sid Herje, came to the ministers and he said, &#8220;We have people living and eating out of the gutter in Carrboro and I would love to see the churches get behind [and help].&#8221; They had a little feeding program in the black Mason&#8217;s building, and these were black churchwomen mainly who were creating one meal a week for black alcoholics. So they said, &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t there be a more concerted effort to address the problems of these displaced people?&#8221; And of course Ronald Reagan had been elected, so the safety net was [in peril]. It was a really tumultuous moment.         Because Rick and I were starry-eyed and na&#239;ve, we went to the Interfaith Council, along with the other ministers who had met with the police chief, and said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been approached by Chief Herje in Carrboro, and could we be a part of this feeding program and maybe have more nights a week that hot meals would be offered to people who have no other place to go?&#8221; And we were turned down. Charitable boards are interesting, then and now. That board had drawn very firm boundaries about what kind of help they were going to give and what kind of help they weren&#8217;t going to give, and they weren&#8217;t going to do direct services, no way, no how, and they dismissed us. And remember, the clergy had actually created the Interfaith Council. They were our organization. So we were speechless. We left that meeting and I said to Rick, &#8220;They turned us down. I can&#8217;t believe they did that.&#8221;         This is when we became acquainted with Bob Seymour, and we began to see what a real leader looks like. Well, Bob was getting close to retirement. He had founded the Interfaith Council, and he was pastor of Binkley Baptist, and he knew who he was, he knew who they were; of course, they all had known him for a lifetime too, so the relationships were different. So we went to Bob and we said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what happened. We can&#8217;t believe this just happened to us. Can you help us?&#8221; He blew his stack. He couldn&#8217;t believe it. So they have their next meeting, he gets on the agenda, he powers himself in there; he laid them out in a way that only a Baptist preacher who knows who he is can lay out a charitable board [laughs] about what their founding was and who they were supposed to be serving. These were the ministers to whom they were to report, asking them to do something. We were looking around, and it was like a changed room. &#8220;Oh, yeah! Of course we&#8217;ll support this!&#8221; So they voted it in, with the proviso that we could find someone to direct it. All they would provide was their name and the umbrella but we had to come up with everything else, including someone to direct the program.         So again, because we were young and stupid, we had no idea how hard that was going to be, so we&#8217;re trying to find a place to have it and someone to direct it, and we did have church support. Chapel of the Cross was very supportive, and Binkley, so we had enough churches saying, &#8220;You know what? Yeah, we&#8217;ll do one night,&#8221; so we did have really good support amongst the clergy. But I was praying about this and I said, &#8220;You know, God, we are doing what you have asked us to do, and you are not helping us.&#8221; I&#8217;ve had some prayers I&#8217;ll probably burn for,--        EF: [Laughs]        JE: --and that was one of them, because I was so upset. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what else to do. We&#8217;re at the end of our rope.&#8221; We had reached the end of the timeline where they said, &#8220;You need to have a director by this time,&#8221; and Sue Baker, who&#8217;s a member here, was on the board at the time--I don&#8217;t know if she was the chair or whether she was just on the board--and she walked in and she said, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe this.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Someone has walked into the Interfaith Council building and said God has called her to direct the kitchen.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re kidding?&#8221; She said, &#8220;No, and not only that, this woman&#8217;s homeless. This is a disaster.&#8221; [Laughs] I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, if she meets the criteria.&#8221; They never told us who it had to be or whether they knew what they were doing. They just said we had to have a director.        EF: Right.        JE: We have a director now. They have to do this. So we did, we started with this woman. Oh, my God. [Laughs] And she only lasted for nine months, but it didn&#8217;t matter. At that point it was the camel&#8217;s nose in the tent. There was a lot of community support for this, and because churches were great, they stepped up. They really wanted to do it. Part of it was a reaction to Ronald Reagan. Like now with Moral Mondays, people were like, [gasps] &#8220;How can this be happening?&#8221; and they needed an outlet for showing their compassion. So it was up and running, and we did it, and we got meals going every night, and from there it was then trying to get a place for especially homeless men to live, so that was the next move. But we had a lot of support, always had a lot of support from the town council. I can&#8217;t say enough about how competent and helpful the Chapel Hill town council has always been. So when we were fighting tooth and nail with neighbors--nobody ever wants a homeless shelter in their neighborhood. It&#8217;s always been contentious.        EF: Sure, sure.        JE: The merchants hated it, they always hated it. That doesn&#8217;t mean there weren&#8217;t some supportive merchants. On Franklin Street there are real troopers who have always supported the homeless shelter, but there are some that never stopped complaining about it. But finally it was really the town council and the town manager who had found block grants. That was back when there were still block grants to states and one of the uses could be for transitioning city buildings for this purpose. So the town manager got all this money from the federal government, and said, &#8220;This is a good deal for Chapel Hill.&#8221; The place was condemned, they couldn&#8217;t use it anyway, so they fixed it up and the men moved in. Those were very exciting days because we were able to do so many things and we had tons of support.         Well, while that was going on, the church is bursting at the seams and we&#8217;re in the fight of our lives to get the church to try to consider an expansion. And in Chapel Hill those, in some ways, are the toughest fights. You&#8217;ve not been here that long, but it&#8217;s probably still this way, [and] it was really that way [then.] In the Northeast we call it &#8220;New England disease,&#8221; and the reason we call it that is they have these gorgeous greens, usually there&#8217;s a Congregationalist church that goes back to Paul Revere, and if you suggest any kind of change, the entire town goes berserk because this is who they are, it&#8217;s ingrained in their identity. It&#8217;s a good thing, it should be preserved, but churches are    not--.        EF: Upsetting the order.        JE: Yeah, they&#8217;re not museums. They&#8217;re living communities, and their purpose is mission. Fortunately for us, I loved the old church, it was very beautiful, but it was not an important town marker. You can see it now. It&#8217;s on Cameron Avenue. It&#8217;s been restored, and it&#8217;s now the graduate student union.         EF: Right.        JE: So thank God it had not been designated as a historic register place, although the neighborhood was being designated as a historic district.        EF: The Rosewood area [actually, Westwood/McCauley].        JE: So that was becoming a problem for expansion because you couldn&#8217;t make the changes. If the church was going to be the church and welcome everybody, and have a church school, youth program, all that, we couldn&#8217;t do it there. It only sat ninety on the floor in the sanctuary. We were already into multiple services. We had rented every building we could rent around the church. We had even done a very expensive plan to renovate that downtown building, which turned out to be an enormous amount of money without real expansion. So, again--you can interpret this in any way you want--to me, we ended up with God intervening in very bizarre ways [laughs] all through our ministry. The engineers for the plan to renovate downtown were assessing the building to see whether our architectural plan was feasible, and they walked out--it was really dramatic--and got out their yellow tape, and they went all the way around the old building and they said, &#8220;Nobody may come in here again because the roof is unstable.&#8221;        EF: Right.        JE: That actually turned out to be a great blessing. Had that not happened, I&#8217;m not sure we ever would have relocated. So it was awful. That happened on a Friday; they came to church on Sunday to find out they would not be allowed back into their sanctuary, and that&#8217;s a terrible thing, especially when it&#8217;s beautiful and old and so much a part of the history of your life in that community.        EF: So that set the wheels in motion to relocate.
JE: So that made relocation actually something you could even consider. The opposition to moving from that site was so fierce that we thought, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way. We&#8217;ll have to change what&#8217;s down here and live with it.&#8221; But then when that happened and we did a reassessment of what we could really do, it became clear to more and more people: this is a lost cause. We cannot do this. This is where you&#8217;ll have to check the newspaper, because all of this got played out in the newspaper. It&#8217;s such a small town.
EF: Right. [Laughs]
JE: I want to say 1993 or 1994, sometime around there. So we rented the Wesley Foundation, which I think has since then been sold by the Methodist ministry. It was our backdoor neighbor, so we rented their sanctuary, which they weren&#8217;t using, and we worshiped at Wesley, we rented as many rooms as we could around the buildings, and then we also used our education building, which was not condemned. It was crazy, and we did that for a long time.
EF: Sure.
JE: I think we did that for at least six or seven years.
EF: Wow.
JE: That there was a church left, when you consider we were becoming open and affirmative of gay and lesbian people--that was in 1993--we opened an iglesia and started a Spanish language ministry then, and then we were fighting like cats in a bag over whether we would relocate or not. But it taught me something about change in the church. When everything&#8217;s in an uproar and everybody&#8217;s upset about the building, that&#8217;s a great time to start a Spanish language ministry because they don&#8217;t have enough energy to cope with it.
EF: [Laughs]
JE: And there were always supportive people in the congregation. Even the people who didn&#8217;t want to move weren&#8217;t unsupportive. They were grieving and sad about what was happening.
EF: Sure, about the historic location.
JE: Also they couldn&#8217;t imagine it. They couldn&#8217;t imagine not coming down there and going to church in walking distance of [the university]. Most of them went to school there and it was like being a graduate student again. It was beautiful to be able to go down there.
EF: Sure.
JE: So I think by 1996 we did it. We finally, in 1996 or 1997, took the vote and we purchased this property, which was another miracle. We couldn&#8217;t find the land. Even then in Chapel Hill, land was so expensive and there was so little of it for institutional use, and we&#8217;re not a car dealership, we&#8217;re a church. Meanwhile, fighting, [laughs] which is not good for fundraising, and trying to figure out if we can do this, and we would have to sell that building in order to make this work. So all of that was so full of complications; I&#8217;m amazed we did it.         But, Rick and I live right across the street, so I saw this &#8220;For Sale&#8221; sign on this property and I called up the committee that was looking at property and I said, &#8220;Have you looked at this property on MLK?&#8221; They looked in the listings and they said, &#8220;You know, that property&#8217;s not listed.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well let&#8217;s look into it. There&#8217;s a &#8216;For Sale&#8217; sign.&#8221; Well, it turned out it was a moment in the life of Duke Energy where they were liquidating properties all over the state of North Carolina, including this spot, fifteen acres. That was Duke Power, right there.
EF: Oh! Okay.
JE: And they retained that property, which was since been sold to the University of North Carolina.
EF: Right! Okay. I didn&#8217;t realize that.
JE: This property was so encumbered by easements that only five acres was buildable, so it sat forever and nobody would buy it. I&#8217;m trying to remember what we bought it for. It wasn&#8217;t very much. So, anyway, the committee jumped on it, looked at it, and said this might really work for United Church. I think we bought it for a hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars [actually $235,000].
EF: For that many acres.
JE: For fifteen acres. But we were a unique usage. We weren&#8217;t trying to make money or turn something around and we wouldn&#8217;t be paying property taxes on it. And, the other thing is, we didn&#8217;t know that that would be a park, so there was always the question mark about where Homestead Park is. &#8220;Well, is that going to be a gas station? What are we looking at?&#8221; So it was risky, but we didn&#8217;t have any money so we said, &#8220;Okay. Let&#8217;s do this.&#8221; Then the denomination at that point really stepped up. They had a special program, almost tailor-made for fighting churches like us with no money, where they would give you a loan basically no questions asked so that you could do this.
EF: This is from the denomination itself?
JE: Yeah, from the United Church of Christ. I want to say it was like four hundred thousand dollars, or something. That cinched the deal because that allowed us to go ahead and purchase a property, not worry about how we were going to get a loan on it, and then focus on how we were going to sell the downtown building, and then borrow and raise the money we did to build the original building. We did all that in the course of about three years, between, I want to say 1996 or 1997, and we were in this building Easter of 2000. Now I look back on it--.
EF: Whirlwind. [Laughs]
JE: It was extraordinary. It was extraordinary. Two hundred families did this thing. This church really didn&#8217;t have any endowment to speak of, and it all had to be used for missions, so there was no extra money anywhere. They ended up taking a hit on the sale of the property downtown. In order to hold the congregation together and help stop the fighting, we had to agree to contracts with the buyer where the building would not be changed for twenty-six years, so we had realtors saying, &#8220;Well, no one is going to take that deal. That&#8217;s crazy. They&#8217;re just not going to do that.&#8221; It turned out we did find a buyer who did it. He renovated it, did a beautiful job, and then he&#8217;s rented the whole business out to the University of North Carolina, and it&#8217;s been great.
EF: Right.
JE: So, anyway, we did sell it for about a million-one. We already had indebtedness here. We raised close to another million, I think, and then we had to borrow the rest. So, man, we got here. And then when we get here and have all this indebtedness and the place is exploding. So we get into the new building, and they&#8217;ve always been astonishing to me; not only did we get in, they decide they need another minister, which is an expensive move for a congregation of that size. There were maybe four or five hundred members then, and they hired a full-time music [actually youth] minister. Then the place was gangbusters, there were people all over the place, and it was disconcerting. The congregation had sacrificed so much to get here, they were so excited, and now the place is full of people they don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s always one dislocation after another when you&#8217;re trying to move a community like that, but still it was so exciting, and the youth minister we hired was the first openly lesbian UCC pastor ever to be ordained in the Southeast. There had been some in New England but not here. So I made this big speech. We bring her to the congregation for the vote, and I said, &#8220;You understand there will probably be ramifications for our doing this,&#8221; because the conference itself was pretty conservative, and there were ramifications. We went through terrible fights over open and affirming in the Southern Conference, and it got so bad that there were people in the conference threatening to throw our church out of the conference.
EF: Could you go back and talk about that?
JE: Talk about how that worked?
EF: Yeah, the open and affirming process?
JE: Because that&#8217;s crazy. Yeah. So in 1993, and partly this was the run-up in the crisis of AIDS and UNC Hospital being one of the rare places where AIDS patients could come and get treatment, so there were a lot of people in the church who were dealing with AIDS, and a lot of people knew gay people and were pretty savvy about the situation. The best help was there were a series of gay males who came out of the closet in the same year among leading families in the congregation. Some of them were very conservative families, so people who normally you would worry about resisting simply did nothing, which is good.
EF: Because of their own family members.
JE: Because their own family members had come out of the closet, and they were hurting themselves so they weren&#8217;t ready for [51:20] exposure. But then other families had had kids come out of the closet who stepped up and said, &#8220;Our whole family&#8217;s not going to be in the closet. We have got to have this discussion at United Church.&#8221; That was wonderful because it came up not as a civil rights issue but as a pastoral care issue of families saying, &#8220;We love our family member; this is how he&#8217;s being treated; this is how we&#8217;re being treated; we&#8217;re hurting, and we need our church to consider the open and affirming process.&#8221;
EF: Right.
JE: So we did, we did that for two years, starting in 1991, and then we voted to become open and affirming in 1993, which now I look back and think, &#8220;Gosh, it was really extraordinary. We were one of the first churches in the conference to do it.&#8221;
EF: So the two-year process of working towards that--.
JE: Right.
EF: What programs did the church do to educate and to talk about it?
JE: This is so typical of United Church. Every time they do something like this, they have like a bazillion study sessions, because it&#8217;s an academic church.
EF: Sure.
JE: And also Rick and I were not willing to do a timeline. We said, &#8220;We are going to discuss this issue until we feel like there is a consensus and the congregation itself says they want to vote.&#8221; So every 10:00 hour we did [52:38] programs there would be something. It might [be] about AIDS, or it might be about parents of children of gay and lesbian people, or it might be a lawyer talking about the legal hassles people have. So we did, we talked about that for two years, and then finally, [laughs] people said, &#8220;If I have to sit in a circle one more time, I&#8217;m going to scream.&#8221;
EF: [Laughs]
JE: So at that point council said, &#8220;Good.&#8221; So they wrote a covenant, which is the other thing United Church always does. They always write some sort of new mission statement or covenant. It was really beautiful, and that was what they voted on, and there were only eight no votes, and of those, most of them still stayed in the congregation. So we were sad for the ones that left, but we wanted them to be comfortable in their new church home, and there was such a strong consensus at United Church about that. After that there was never really [any more opposition]. People here were great.
EF: And what was the reaction from the conference, or from the United Church of Christ itself?
JE: Oh, so what happened in the Southern Conference--? So the United Church of Christ has been open and affirming since the early 1980s, and we&#8217;ve had an ordained openly gay male since 1973, I think, in California, so this is not a new issue for the United Church of Christ, the national church. The president at the time was a personal friend of ours, John Thomas, so we had lots of support from the national church. And as long as Rollin Russell, who&#8217;s now a member here and he&#8217;s been conference minister, he was hugely supportive of O&amp;A, so we never even thought about it because the conference minister was strong and very supportive.         But then there was a new church start, North Raleigh, that was actually started by the United Church of Christ to be an open and affirming congregation in Raleigh, so there was no guesswork here. But then when they came to the association it was [a] point at which Rollin had retired, so we were in a leadership vacuum in the Southern Conference, which is when mischief always arises. These things love a vacuum. There were very conservative pastors who really didn&#8217;t want this to happen, so they used the constitution in the ENCA, which required a two-thirds vote for a church to come in, a very high bar. I never could understand it. Why is it so hard for people to get in? I still don&#8217;t know why that is, but it was, so all they had to find was one over a third people who didn&#8217;t want open and affirming, and they could keep that church out.         And they did, they kept North Raleigh, which is now Umstead UCC, out of the association for three years. We had association meetings where we couldn&#8217;t even pass an agenda. It was like the way [of] politics. This is why, in some ways, I understand what happened with the Tea Party, because the tactics that the Southern Baptists used to take over institutions and then these conservative pastors used in the Southern Conference. They are the same tactics that the hard right Tea Party used in American politics, and they&#8217;re by and large the same body of people. They basically don&#8217;t compromise and they know what they want, and they have a national approach of going after institutions. They understand where the weak links are in these democracies and they know how to exploit them, so they knew the weak link was this two-thirds requirement. Then they did a very cynical thing, which was they really went after African Americans, who at the time had not been brought along in open and affirming, didn&#8217;t know what to make of the issue, and at the time were not friendly toward it. That was devastating because there had been a durable alliance between African Americans and liberal whites in the ENCA until that happened. This was a failure of education also. The denomination and those of us in the conference had not done enough to bring churches along on this issue. Also the United Church of Christ voted for marriage equality sometime in the middle 2000s [2005], and that was the last straw. These churches, who couldn&#8217;t even imagine a civil union, some who didn&#8217;t even have women as deacons-- they were so traditional--and then to have the denomination vote marriage equality and to have this communicated by this hard right group within the church, that was the end of [it]. There were black churches that pulled out. It was heartbreaking to see that.         So finally we got a new conference minister in who was African American, pro O&amp;A, and got it done. He just about killed himself getting this done and getting it voted in, and during that time, that&#8217;s when there were churches who were threatening United Church with expulsion from the association, which technically they could have done. They had to get sixty-six percent to get us out. It&#8217;s a high bar to get in, but it&#8217;s a very high bar to get kicked out, and they almost had it. There was one meeting where you could tell they were counting up to see if they had two-thirds and enough to expel the O&amp;A churches, but they didn&#8217;t do it. They never got that kind of strength.
EF: Wow.
JE: Yeah. We were on the phone with our president, John Thomas, saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re loyal. We&#8217;re aligned with the United Church of Christ and now we&#8217;re being threatened with the removal of our standing in the denomination,&#8221; but because the denomination is atomized and you hold standing in your association, there wasn&#8217;t any way the national church could intervene. I never thought that could happen. [Laughs] I never thought it could happen.
EF: It&#8217;s fascinating though.
JE: Yeah. Who would believe it?
EF: Well the last thing I want to ask about is your experience more recently with the Moral Mondays here in 2013.
JE: Yeah! Who thought we&#8217;d be doing that?
EF: Right. [Laughs]
JE: So, let&#8217;s see. This legislature got voted in in 2010, so a lot of us who&#8217;ve been worried about our public life have been very concerned for these three years. And then of course Bev Perdue decided not to run, and we had the disaster in November where Dalton was defeated, and people really thought McCrory was going to be moderate. There were people in this church who voted for him who are heartsick now because they thought he would be a stronger leader--he had a moderate reputation in Charlotte--and he would be able to deal with the legislature, which of course isn&#8217;t how it&#8217;s worked out.         What&#8217;s interesting to me in watching Moral Monday is that William Barber&#8217;s been around for a long time, and I&#8217;ve always loved his preaching and he&#8217;s always the featured preacher for MLK Day or Freedom Day. We&#8217;d heard him and always had been impressed by how smart he was and what an effective preacher he is, and he&#8217;s actually a cousin of one of our conference officers. Vertie Powers is his cousin. She&#8217;s since gone to Chicago. But anyway, so in April on Maundy Thursday, the legislature did something about voting rights that Barber couldn&#8217;t believe, and that tipped him over the edge. He said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to orchestrate something to call attention,&#8221; so that&#8217;s when the Moral Mondays started. There are members of this church that are very much hardwired in with the NAACP and have been worried about especially the Racial Justice Act, so we&#8217;re very fortunate to be involved early on and to have people who are directly connected with the NAACP.        So among the first people--no, second. The first group was the leadership of the NAACP, but the second group had three members of United Church arrested, [1:01:22] and Andy Short. I hope I&#8217;m not missing anybody. Then there were maybe thirty people on the mall, half of whom were from this church. So on one hand we were really proud of people for being arrested and grateful to the News &amp; Observer for covering the story, which has been really important, but looking around going, &#8220;This is just pitiful.&#8221; Rick and I probably could have named everybody of the thirty. Most of them were from Chapel Hill or from Pullen [Church] in Raleigh.
EF: Oh, yeah.
JE: Yeah, Pullen, First Presbyterian&#8217;s retired pastor, Joe Harvard, was really active.
EF: From Raleigh?
JE: No, he&#8217;s in Durham. That&#8217;s First Pres[byterian] in Durham.
EF: Okay.
JE: The Jewish community got in right away and then lots of UCC and Unitarians, but we&#8217;re looking around going, &#8220;Oh my. We&#8217;re in so much trouble. If all it is is Chapel Hill or the Triangle, we&#8217;re done. Nobody&#8217;s going to pay any attention.&#8221; But I underestimated William Barber, I really did. He is brilliant. He&#8217;s a brilliant preacher, and he&#8217;s a master strategist, and he never gave up. He never stopped encouraging people. Any time you went to anything where he was present, people had a good experience so you didn&#8217;t mind bringing people. That&#8217;s important. So, yeah, in May then it was eye-opening, how many more people. Every week there would be more and more people, and every week more people were being arrested, and I can&#8217;t even remember. When was I arrested? Oh, I know. Rick and I were going to Scotland at the end of May, so I pretty much in my own mind decided that I would probably be arrested. I must have been arrested on the [June] 17th.
EF: Okay, right in mid-June.
JE: Of June, right in the middle of it, yeah, and it was big. By that time there were lots of people coming out, and there were lots of people getting arrested. Kira Frescoln, who had been a former confirmation student of mine, signed up to be arrested. Rick and I both had agreed, we would be arrested but we wouldn&#8217;t let anybody go alone, so if we saw somebody by themselves we would decide to be arrested. So there she is. Rick had a hard and fast commitment so he couldn&#8217;t be arrested that night, so he was upset that he couldn&#8217;t be with me and do it, but it was fine. Susan Steinberg and Kira Frescoln and David Otto and I all got arrested that night, and it was an important experience. We saw the difference between the capitol police and Wake County, which was like day and night. It&#8217;s clear the capitol police are doing the legislature&#8217;s bidding and they&#8217;re pretty tough, so we sat with our hands bound for three hours, perched on the edge of a bench. Then the minute we got to Wake, they would clip your bonds and they moved us right through. I bet we were out in a half hour.
EF: And they didn&#8217;t even process you, is that right?
JE: No, they didn&#8217;t take my picture. They did not fingerprint us. I thought it was clear they didn&#8217;t have a dog in this fight. Wake wanted to get us out of there as fast as they could, and they did, and that&#8217;s been the report ever since my experience on the 17th. In Rick&#8217;s case they didn&#8217;t even put him in a cell. In our case they put us in a cell but not for very long, because they&#8217;re trying to get you in front of the magistrate in an orderly way, and that&#8217;s what they would normally do. Rick said they didn&#8217;t even put them in cells; they took them right up to the magistrate, they lined them up, and they got them out. So Wake has clearly made a determination about how much of their man and woman power.         The other thing that was really striking is that the night I was there, the capitol police were white males in their old Smoky Bear uniforms. It looked to me like a documentary, the type of which I would have watched on black and white TV in the 1960s, of Bull Connor. I thought, &#8220;Really? You&#8217;re seriously doing this?&#8221; And here&#8217;s how the police look and here&#8217;s how they&#8217;re treating citizens. But then when you got to Wake, half of the force at least, maybe more than half, were African-American, it looked like half of them were women, they were very professional, and they moved everybody through and there was none of this posturing or theater or any of this stuff that was going on in the basement of the capitol. So it was good to see that firsthand, that the legislature is clearly living in its own world, and maybe they like it there. I don&#8217;t know.         Now last Monday--did you hear about this?--they didn&#8217;t come. So Barber has this big march, and he&#8217;s talking about voting rights and there are, again, thousands of people on the mall and people ready to be arrested. And at the last minute, we got an email from Ellie Kinnaird, who&#8217;s our senator, saying, &#8220;The senate&#8217;s not meeting tonight.&#8221;
EF: Oh, yeah!
JE: They cancelled at the last minute, and the house, at the last minute, decided to adjourn at 4:00 so that none of them would be around for the Moral Monday protest. They had CNN, they had MSNBC, they had a phalanx of media, and they&#8217;re gone. I thought, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe they did that.&#8221;
EF: Well, weren&#8217;t they around the next day for the Thankful Tuesday part? [Laughs]
JE: Well, the next day--.
EF: Or some of them were.
JE: Yeah, there was a Thankful Tuesday. That was the week before. They had like two hundred people there.
EF: Right.
JE: The next day people did go back to protest. In fact, they&#8217;ve protested every day this week.        EF: Oh.        JE: Well, because of the voter rights [1:07:17]        EF: Oh, that&#8217;s right, with the flamingos. [Laughs]        JE: Oh, my goodness. It&#8217;s frightening.        EF: Sure.        JE: Well then we got a call this week. So I preached, I did a sermon on Amos--did you hear it?--on Sunday--        EF: Yeah.        JE: --about this new tax on electricity and how it really burdens the rural poor in North Carolina, and I worked with the Council of Churches to get my information about that. They were great. Then we get a call from PBS, and they were in New York or Philadelphia, one of the two, their religious and ethics unit. Who knew? They had talked to the North Carolina Council of Churches; they wanted to do a piece on religious ethics and this new public presence of the churches around these events, who could they talk to, and they said, &#8220;You should talk to the United Church of Chapel Hill.&#8221; We&#8217;re very happy about that.        EF: Sure.        JE: So that reporter called Rick two days ago, and they asked about our participation in Moral Monday and, as far as being theologians and ethicists, how are we looking at this and what&#8217;s our approach? Rick talked to them. Then Rick talked about the blessing of the justice advocates that we&#8217;ve been doing every Sunday at United Church at every service, and at every service we&#8217;ve had thirty people or more come forward, so that&#8217;s changing this congregation. It&#8217;s amazing to me, the people that are doing this, and how many people are there when I go. Whole families are now coming, and bringing little children and saying, &#8220;I want my kids to see this. I want them to understand what you have to do if you&#8217;re going to be a citizen of this country.&#8221; I&#8217;ve never seen anything like it, not in my whole ministry ever, to see this level of energy and this many people demonstrating from one parish. So anyway, PBS is coming Sunday at the 11:00 service. They&#8217;re sending their crew from the Northeast with their camera people, and they&#8217;re going to take pictures of us blessing the justice advocates. [Laughs]        EF: Right. That&#8217;ll be great.        JE: And then they&#8217;re going to interview people after the service. I&#8217;m thrilled. I couldn&#8217;t be happier.        EF: Yeah, it&#8217;ll be great, for posterity too.        JE: Well, it is. I mean my hope is that this is a blip and that twenty-five years from now people will be going, &#8220;Really? That really happened?&#8221; That&#8217;s my best case scenario. [Laughs]        EF: Well thanks so much, Jill. Is there anything else that I didn&#8217;t ask about?        JE: I&#8217;ve been talking for an hour and twenty minutes. [Laughs]        EF: It&#8217;s a lot of good stuff. Well thank you very much. Let me go ahead and turn this off.
