Evan Faulkenbury: Today is June 12, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m here at the Liberty University School of Law interviewing Dr. Judith Reisman in Lynchburg, Virginia. So first, thank you for being here, Dr. Reisman. The first thing I&#8217;d really like to hear about is where you were born and your early childhood.
Judith Reisman: I was born in Hillside, New Jersey, Beth Israel Hospital &#8211; I have a brother, or I had a brother, one year older &#8211; to a married mother and father, and they were Communists. They were busy saving the world for that. That&#8217;s my background. I was brought up with the idea of all for one, one for all and all that sort of thing. And they meant very well. They absolutely did. [We] were middle class, I suppose. My father owned a fish store, fresh fish. In those years you had special stores for fish and I suppose for meat too. I don&#8217;t remember. So, they owned a fish store, and I remember my father had a ninth grade education and had gone to work right after, had to quit [school]. His father was killed accidentally in a boxing ring, so&#8211;.   [Interruption; transcript continues at 02:35]
Let&#8217;s see. So, what did I say?
EF: You were describing your father&#8217;s and your grandfather&#8217;s life.
JR: Oh, yeah. So, the father had&#8211; [it was the Depression], so they went from owning a candy store to owning a fish establishment, and as I looked back on it I was so surprised. Ninth grade was his education and high school was my mother. They had more knowledge, more history, more geography, more knowledge of literature, everything, than I had as a PhD, which seemed to me like that wasn&#8217;t exactly the way it was supposed to work. So they ran the business, was no problem. I mean it was a pretty good-sized business.         I remember that&#8217;s how I learned there was a difference between Catholics and us because they ate fish on Friday, and so people would come in during the war &#8211; we moved into World War II &#8211; people would come in during the war and try and get more fish, but it was black market to sell fish, [without a ration coupon]. Other people &#8211; is that coming through?
EF: Yeah, you&#8217;re fine. I&#8217;m just double checking.
JR: Other people, other stores, sold under the table but my father said, no, no, no, no. So he sold only to the people who had their little coupons and actually turned in some of my mother&#8217;s brothers, who owned a fish store too, and they were doing black market dealing. So, he told my mother, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to turn them in. We warned them. We warned them.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t think he would, and he did. Anyway, so he was on OPA. What was that? I don&#8217;t remember. O-something Price Commission. So that&#8217;s how I learned about the Catholics, and I also felt very sorry, very sad, that all my friends got to eat hotdogs and I had to eat lobster and shrimp and all that, and I thought that was a real dirty deal.
EF: Well can you tell me a bit about how your parents came to join the Communist party and what their activities were, as you remember?
JR: It was not unusual. It was the Depression when they joined and people were without food. There were bread lines. So I don&#8217;t know how they did or what but it was something that you did if you were deeply concerned about the equity for rich and poor, the wealthy making a great deal of money during the Depression and the people standing in bread lines, the working people. So they were part of that: we should change things.
EF: So, growing up, what was the impact of your parents and your wider family on your own development as you grew from childhood to adolescence?
JR: Well, all my wider family thought my mother and father were crazy. [Laughs] They didn&#8217;t believe in all that stuff. Anyway, they didn&#8217;t agree with their politics. When Khrushchev announced that Stalin had massacred people &#8211; which was 1950-something, I don&#8217;t remember &#8211; that was a huge surprise for them, because we used to get those big USSR Today, big glossy magazines, and there were men and women working in the fields and they were harvesting the grains, and then it turned out that really they weren&#8217;t. There was a lot of fraud in there. Then he massacred millions, Stalin, more than World War II Hitler, and that was a wakeup call for my father, not for my mother. She thought that the people still should have equal rights with the rich and all that sort of thing.         But my father just quit, and the Communist party basically disappeared from the United States, which was really interesting for me because when I went to Croatia I met up with hard line Communists there, and boy, they are tyrants. They are really tyrants, and this is when communism supposedly is defeated, but these guys still run the University of Zagreb, the philosophy department and so on, and they are really tyrants. Anyway, I learned a lot going to Croatia, which I knew, but [it was really interesting].
So, back to my history. I met my husband, we got married.
EF: When was that?
JR: When? That&#8217;s a good question.1952? Something like that. I was nineteen.
EF: Okay. At that point in time had you also been involved at all in any political movements locally?
JR: Oh, yeah, I was in Labor Youth League.
EF: Tell me about that.
JR: Oh, it wasn&#8217;t the Communist party, but it really was--. It&#8217;s like any youth group today: young people who want to do the right thing, and they&#8217;re out there, and&#8211;. We protested&#8211;. They still discriminated in the bowling alley in Los Angeles against blacks, and in Arizona they discriminated against blacks, so I was on picket lines when I was a little kid, and then when I was a youth. Then after the picket lines and protests and all that we would go off to the beach and play our guitars and sing. We didn&#8217;t drink. We didn&#8217;t have drugs. That wasn&#8217;t part of the ambiance. People played guitars and they sang, and we didn&#8217;t have sex. [Laughs] Yeah, yeah, we didn&#8217;t do that, because that&#8217;s not what people did at that time, so I know that it&#8217;s possible.
Let&#8217;s see. So I was in Labor Youth League, and that&#8217;s what we did. We marched [for] the Stockholm Peace Appeal, passed out leaflets and all that stuff. Oh, and then I went to work to change the culture. I went to work in meatpacking and electrical work.
EF: Okay. In the labor unions?
JR: Yeah, and I worked with the Mexican women who were there because we were in Los Angeles.
EF: Oh, you had moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles?
JR: Yeah, right, a long time, through Arizona to LA.
EF: Okay. So you were a teenager in California?
JR: Yeah, seventeen. I was at Fairfax High School so, yeah.
EF: Okay.
JR: So then, let&#8217;s see. Oh, yeah. So &#8211; what was I saying?
EF: Your involvement in the unions.
JR: Oh, yeah. So, the Mexican women, they all thought I was crazy because they knew I was educated. They said, &#8220;What are you doing here? Why are you working so hard?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s important,&#8221; or whatever. I learned a lot there about people&#8217;s lives, not from books or anything but really from working with the women, and I heard stories of their lives &#8211; that you should record someday &#8211;
EF: Sure.
JR: &#8211;about really tragic lives and escapes from really bad situations, with children, without children. [Brief interruption] So that was very helpful to me. Anyway, I tried to help organize the unions and then found that the union representatives were being paid off. They&#8217;d be coming out of the boss&#8217;s office at Christmastime carrying bottles, big things with bottles of booze. So I thought, well, wait a minute; that&#8217;s not supposed to happen. They&#8217;re supposed to be getting higher wages, better working conditions, and so on.         So from there, why did I go back to school? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t remember. Well, I guess I was married, so then I had my kids. It was the time of the Korean War. We had our kids, four girls. The FBI investigated us.         EF: Oh!        JR: Yeah, right. Oh, we have FBI reports. See, you didn&#8217;t know. [Laughs] This is who you&#8217;re working for, yeah. So we had FBI reports and all.        EF: They followed your family and your labor union activities, I assume?        JR: Uh huh, and it was really funny because in my father&#8217;s [file] they recorded&#8211;. He was a singer. Oh, he sang beautifully. He was operatic but he decided he couldn&#8217;t sing for the capitalists so he only would sing at the Communist party meetings, and they were very happy to have that. Okay, anyway, yeah. They had, in his FBI report, the songs that he sang, because I got a hold of the report. It was so wonderful, &#8220;Matt Gelernter sang some song or other,&#8221; and about my mother they said something about, &#8220;She&#8217;s such a gracious lady,&#8221; in the report. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that she&#8217;s a Communist,&#8221; or something like that. Yeah. So those were very na&#239;ve times, extremely na&#239;ve times, which I suppose is basically true about most times, and it&#8217;s one reason that I can continue to press for justice myself in my own way, because I know how people can be manipulated. I know how they can be fooled. I saw my own parents completely fooled and manipulated by a theory. So, anyway.        EF: Well, on that note, can you describe in detail the path you took leading away from this labor union activity towards more conservative thought and practice?        JR: I don&#8217;t know how it happened. After Stalin, I found that Stalin had murdered all these people, and nothing was in the press. Nothing was. Okay, my parents used to say &#8211; which helped me a lot &#8211; &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever believe what you read,&#8221; because the capitalists lie. But, you should believe what the Communists say in The People&#8217;s World and in their newspapers. So I did. I believed. But it wasn&#8217;t in any newspaper. Now, it&#8217;s not that our government didn&#8217;t know that Stalin had massacred millions of people, for goodness sake, and it&#8217;s not that the Communists didn&#8217;t know that the Communists had massacred millions of people, so nobody was talking about it. Well that made absolutely no sense.         I think that was the beginning of my disenchantment and taking another look at what we were believing, because neither newspapers were telling the truth about Stalin. Why? Why? Why wouldn&#8217;t the capitalist &#8211; quote, unquote &#8211; press, why wouldn&#8217;t the New York Times, look and say, wow; that guy is massacring millions? Why did it take Khrushchev to come out and blow the whistle for them to report it? So it made no sense at all, and then it started to make sense later, as I investigated a lot of other things, that they agreed with each other. Rockefeller and Ford and Carnegie and these guys had no problem with the Communist party. Yeah. They controlled the mass media. So, anyway.         So, I went into singing.         EF: Oh! Tell me about that.         JR: Yeah. I started writing songs for children &#8211; I had children &#8211; and I worked for Educational Television. It was called that at the time, PBS.        EF: Right. PBS&#8217;s forerunner, you mean?        JR: Yeah, ETV.        EF: Right.        JR: So I worked for Educational Television, writing songs and singing, and had a little puppet &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember his name &#8211; and he used to play the guitar for me. I wrote songs about history, geography, anthropology; worked for the museum, the Milwaukee Public Museum; worked for the art museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art; all those guys, and Scholastic, which is now terrible but then it wasn&#8217;t; did music for Scholastic and that sort of thing. I worked for NBC, ABC, PBS &#8211; or ETV.        EF: For a good many different children&#8217;s shows.        JR: Well, yeah, children&#8217;s shows or I would do a musical segment for some special thing, or whatever. I went to Israel and did a huge [show] for CBS and did coverage in Israel on camels. I sat on a camel and all that kind of thing. Oh, well, anyway, that&#8217;s a long story. So that&#8217;s what I did. Then I went back to school.        EF: For graduate school, you mean?        JR: Yeah. Why did I go back to school?        EF: Yes.         JR: Yes. I was working for Captain and&#8211;.        EF: Captain Kangaroo?        JR: Yeah, and I was watching one of my songs on the television. It was something about families or&#8211;. I don&#8217;t remember. Anyway, I was watching one of them, and I thought that was pretty good. And how many people watching that, I thought? Oh, six million. I think we had six million at the time, mostly adults &#8211; not mostly, but, a lot of adults. They liked Captain. I thought, &#8220;They&#8217;re watching my tune, and I&#8217;m trying to give them a moral lesson in my tune.&#8221; [This is the old commie coming out], the moral lesson. Well, anyway, it was about family, and I thought, &#8220;Oh; that&#8217;s nice.&#8221;        Then the segment went off and the advertisements came on. So my segment went off, the six million are still watching, and the ads for: &#8220;Oh, get this toy! Get that toy, I have to have this and that and the other thing,&#8221; came on, and I thought, &#8220;Come on!&#8221; Everything I accomplished in my little three-minute segment is invalid in the next &#8211; because it&#8217;s not three minutes. The ads went on and on and on. So I thought: this is not accomplishing much. Then I went to the grocery store and I see these kids yelling at their parents, they want that sweet, they want that toy, and I thought, it completely invalidates the parent as a decision-maker, completely, and this is 1970, I guess. We&#8217;re not talking sex, we&#8217;re not talking violence.  The relationship is skewed, and the child&#8217;s needs &#8211; and they&#8217;re not needs &#8211; are being&#8211;. The mother gives up and she gets whatever the kid wants.         So I decided to go back to school, and I was going to go back and examine the effect of television on behavior. I went back, and it was about 1974, because then I discovered &#8211; here we go with the mass media again &#8211; I discovered in 1972 the Surgeon General&#8217;s Commission on Television Violence had completely clearly identified thousands of &#8211; I want to say three thousand&#8211; scientific studies &#8211; as if you needed scientific studies; you don&#8217;t need scientific studies &#8211; that the effects of television were disastrous. Children were becoming aggressive.  Actually there was an increase in not only aggressivity but murder wherever, as the television came into the children&#8217;s lives, and yet that was not reported in the papers either.         A Surgeon General&#8217;s Commission, 1972? It never saw headlines? Headlines should have been: &#8220;Television causes children to be violent. It increases rape by x percent.&#8221; It was all there, in 1972. As a matter of fact [Senator Proxmire, I remember, was] in charge of something about aggression, and he was interviewed and they had cameras interviewing him, and he was being interviewed and he was reporting on the Surgeon General&#8217;s Report because he cared about those things, and the cameras were on him. They never showed any of that footage, never. The only people that did, there was a Canadian television network, so it was on Canadian television. Oh, thank you very much. So that means that we&#8217;re heavy-duty controlled, you know? That means you&#8217;re shaping a nation exactly the way you want it. Who&#8217;s shaping them, and why, and what?         EF: So these events were what motivated you to return to graduate school to study communications, is that right?        JR: Yeah, I was in, and that&#8217;s what I was doing. But I figured I was going to try to study television. In fact, it&#8217;s already clear. I&#8217;m inventing the wheel again, and the wheel has been invented thousands of times. I don&#8217;t know how many &#8211; I have it here somewhere &#8211; how many studies were done.         So I was in a class, and the class was Television Effect.        EF: This was at Case Western?        JR: Yeah.         EF: Okay.         JR: One of the guys in my group did a porn flick. I walk in the room, where we&#8217;re doing all the filming and so on, and up on the screen was a very graphic image. Today it would be, eh. [Laughs] I thought, &#8220;What is that, at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio?&#8221; I went to my professor and I said, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on here? He&#8217;s filming porn.&#8221; And the professor, who turned out to be a pornography addict himself, okay, Lowell, said, &#8220;Well, no, that&#8217;s okay because doctors have to lose their inhibitions. We show these kinds of films to doctors and that&#8217;s healthy for them, and all the people on the film have agreed. They knew it was pornography so it&#8217;s not a problem. Consent was there.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Alright, okay.&#8221;         So the film was my first experience with an unmonitored experiment, which is typical of the kinds of experiments carried on today, because when he finished, it was &#8220;Love is Not a Dirty Word.&#8221; That was the music. [Singing] &#8220;Love is not a dirty word,&#8221; duh-da-duh-da-duh, and all these dirty pictures are on the screen. The first camera was a woman &#8211; or a girl &#8211; the second camera was a girl, the director was a girl, the floor manager was a girl, and they had all agreed to do this. So, after, I went up to each of them and I said, &#8220;How did you feel about this?&#8221; [They said,] &#8220;Oh, it was fine. No problem. No problem,&#8221; real cool. Okay, okay.         So then playback time came, when you play back the film, and everybody did a film. So everybody&#8217;s films were pretty good, basic, and then his, [Singing] &#8220;Love is not a dirty word. Love is not a dirty word.&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing on the screen. There&#8217;s nothing. It&#8217;s blank. Everybody&#8217;s sitting around waiting, and you got the cable from the camera, and then you got a picture, and then it went off. It was chaos. It was chaos. All these consent: &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t bother me, no, no, no.&#8221; Oh, isn&#8217;t that interesting?         So I went back and I asked these gals, &#8220;What happened to you? You did camera on so-and-so&#8217;s piece and you didn&#8217;t have any problem at all getting the shot up. Here, all of a sudden, no shot.&#8221; [She said,] &#8220;Oh, well it wasn&#8217;t my fault.&#8221; [I said,] &#8220;What was it?&#8221; [She said,] &#8220;Well it was the director. She didn&#8217;t call out the shot in time.&#8221; Okay. I go to the director: &#8220;Oh, it wasn&#8217;t my fault. It was the floor manager. She didn&#8217;t call the something in time.&#8221; So everybody blamed everybody else. The fact is they didn&#8217;t want to put it up. They couldn&#8217;t look. They couldn&#8217;t look. That&#8217;s as simple as can be. Yet they gave consent, because they didn&#8217;t understand their own emotions. They didn&#8217;t understand their own sense and sensibility. So to be cool they gave consent, which is typical of today. So that turned my attention to the issue of pornography.        EF: Yeah, going from there and getting your PhD in communications, what motivated you to involve yourself in studying pornography and child sex abuse, in your early career?        JR: First it was just pornography, because I didn&#8217;t know the connection with child abuse. So at first &#8211; I&#8217;m going to get a copy of this?        EF: Mm hmm.        JR: At first, after that experience, I started doing work in the area of pornography. As I said, my thesis advisor was an addict so he had no problem with me doing research on what he&#8217;s addicted to, except he didn&#8217;t say he was addicted but he kept his magazines in his drawer at the university. Okay.         Anyway, so I did some experiments, which I didn&#8217;t realize were experiments. I shouldn&#8217;t have done them. We did EKGs. We had fourteen volunteers and we got a base run and they [gave] consent. Then we showed different images, and they were definitely resonating, but I thought at the time, like other people, that that would be okay. Well it wasn&#8217;t okay, not that they complained, but it wasn&#8217;t. We did a survey of a hundred and forty-seven women about what they thought, so the conflict was always there. They would always say, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t bother me,&#8221; basically, and then you ask them questions about their sense of self and the way men look at [them] and it was in complete contrast, complete contrast. So I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Wow; this is really not good, not good.&#8221;        So then, the way it led to child sex abuse, I was at my desk one day and I was going to deliver a paper &#8211; we had done a paper &#8211; on the effects of pornography on women, because that&#8217;s what it was. So I got a hold of this engineering guy &#8211; he was addicted too &#8211; and I asked him, I said, &#8220;Can I have some of your Playboys? He said, &#8220;What do you want them for?&#8221; So I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to look at them. I just want to go through them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, which ones?&#8221; because he couldn&#8217;t let go of certain ones, even for&#8211;. [Laughs] He couldn&#8217;t tell how long I was going to need them.         So anyway, I got his stack and I started going through them. Well, anyway, I started going through them and flipping them, and I thought, &#8220;Did I see a kid? Did I? No.&#8221; Then I go back and, &#8220;Yeah; that&#8217;s a kid. This is a child, and this is not a good picture.&#8221; Okay, it&#8217;s a cartoon but it&#8217;s not funny, and it&#8217;s abuse. Well I thought, "Okay, that&#8217;s one. Will there be more?" So I&#8217;m flipping and there&#8217;s another one, and I&#8217;m flipping, and another one. So then I went back and started to look at the totality of the magazine and realized that Playmate has &#8211; are children they have the little pictures of children, and I&#8211;. Whoa! This is not good. There&#8217;s going to be child sexual abuse here. This is not innocent.         Then my daughter was raped by the boy upstairs, who was thirteen, at which point I realized later that laws had been changed to accommodate the fact that [if] a boy of thirteen abuses a girl of ten there&#8217;s a little peer exception rule so that they can rape kids. What is this about? So all this starts to add up, and my daughter, her reaction to this rape &#8211; it was over a year until I found out &#8211; was indicative of&#8211;. And the boy had stacks of Playboy. His father collected Playboy and they were up in his closet, stacks of it, but I&#8217;d never connected all these things. I mean I knew because I knew the mother and she mentioned it, and I thought at the time, "That&#8217;s silly. What man looks at that? My goodness!" But I never thought more than that about it. So then the connection is made between Playboy and the rapes, and it turns out that my daughter wasn&#8217;t the only one. It was the neighbor children, boys and girls. This kid was molesting them, and he was getting therapy, so the therapist wasn&#8217;t permitted to tell any of the neighbors or anybody, warn anybody that we had a predator in our midst, because there&#8217;s [doctor-patient] privilege. What is going on here?        EF: And this is while you were in Cleveland?        JR: [Pause] I don&#8217;t remember. No. I don&#8217;t remember. I can&#8217;t figure it out.        EF: That&#8217;s okay.        JR: Yeah, so I have that background. My daughter doesn&#8217;t want me to talk to anybody but I get permission to tell my friend, Carol. I call my friend Carol and I tell her. She&#8217;s in Berkeley. She&#8217;s as Berkeley as you can get. I tell her, &#8220;Carol, this is what happened to Jenny and I&#8217;m so upset,&#8221; and she says, &#8220;Judy, you don&#8217;t understand. Children are sexual from birth. She probably kind of wanted this experience,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No, she didn&#8217;t. Thank you very much,&#8221; and I hung up. Then I called my aunt in Maryland, matriarch kind of lady, couldn&#8217;t be more different, and I tell her what happened and she says, &#8220;Well, Judy, you have to understand, children are sexual from birth. She was probably a little interested,&#8221; and so on. Now, I have been a communist-type and I know a party line when I hear a party line, and how you have a party line bridging those kinds of areas, geographically and experientially and politically, there&#8217;s still agreement, the same? She writes about it now, Linda Bartlett.        EF: Right.         JR: It&#8217;s wonderful.         EF: So, if I can ask, how did your daughter deal with that terrible experience and how did you, as a parent and as a researcher, also put it all together?        JR: Well for a year, she didn&#8217;t deal with it well because we didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know. Once she said what happened, and in those years we didn&#8217;t know to call it rape, so I said, &#8220;Well you were seduced. You were seduced.&#8221; She said he had her shoes and she couldn&#8217;t go. It didn&#8217;t matter to her, I suppose. It&#8217;s okay, the words. I said, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your fault,&#8221; and so on.         EF: Sure.        JR: And I couldn&#8217;t do anything about him because the woman had sent him back to England. They apparently knew. They heard from the other kids so they got rid of the kid. So then, it took a little while, but she was okay after she told me and we told her father &#8211; I got permission &#8211; and he handled it okay: &#8220;It&#8217;s not your fault,&#8221; and so on. But I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if the brain aneurysm that she had, that she died from really, had something to do with that.        EF: When was that?         JR: Well, when she was twenty-one.         EF: Oh, wow.        JR: Yeah. She had a brain aneurysm. No proof or anything. But we know, or I have said, that the sex education kids are getting is a trauma. I mean it is a trauma. The way these children are being given sex information in the schools is affecting their brains in very dangerous ways. But, anyway.         EF: Well can you tell me a bit about how you came to focus on Alfred Kinsey and what he represented and how your research wanted to counter that?        JR: Yes. [Hugh] Hefner said he was reading Kinsey, he was a virgin in college and he was reading Kinsey, and he would be Kinsey&#8217;s pamphleteer. Yeah? Then I was delivering my paper on women and their reactions to pornography and so on at the British Psychological Association [conference on love and attraction], and Tom O&#8217;Carroll, a pedophile, who headed the Pedophile Information Exchange in England where they had a list of how you get kids, where you find them and all, was coming to our conference. I knew that a group of people at the conference were pedophiles, or just deviants and perverts, because they were on the Penthouse &#8220;Forum.&#8221; So it&#8217;s complicated. All the academicians there at this conference, except me, said that Tom O&#8217;Carroll, freedom of speech, he should come and he should speak about pedophilia as a viable exchange, and I said, &#8220;Heck no. [We were in Wales.] We&#8217;re guests of the people and we have no right to bring in a pedophile who advocates raping their kids, and then we leave and they&#8217;re left with that talk from an academic institution? No. Never.&#8221; So I was the only one who said that. Everybody else thought it was a freedom of speech, right, which says a lot about our academic sensibility, in my opinion.         Anyway, so I was presenting my paper and a psychologist that was there came up to me and said, &#8220;If you really are concerned about child sexual abuse,&#8221; because that was in the Playboy, he says, &#8220;You have to look at Kinsey,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; I mean, I knew Kinsey, so I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; So he said, &#8220;I worked with Kinsey and with Wardell Pomeroy. One is a pedophile and the other is a homosexual.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Which is which?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Read and discover,&#8221; and he walked out of the room and walked out of my life. I can&#8217;t find him.         So, I did. I read and I discovered. So that&#8217;s how the connection came between &#8211; and Kinsey was the man who said, &#8220;Children are sexual from birth.&#8221; Nobody had said that before him, and Playboy drew it in their cartoon. So the picture echoed the position of Kinsey, and that&#8217;s been disastrous for children. It&#8217;s been disastrous. Children are spiritual from birth. There&#8217;s nothing biblical that says that they&#8217;re sexual. There&#8217;s nothing that defines children as sexual at all, and skipping past biblically, if we&#8217;re talking anatomically and biologically, no. That&#8217;s not true. The churches have accepted it, a lot of them: we have to have sex education because children are sexual. What? There isn&#8217;t the slightest reason to believe that. They&#8217;re sexualized. They&#8217;re hyper-sexualized by our society, by the mass media, but left to their own lives, living, that&#8217;s not true at all, not at all. So that&#8217;s how I got involved.         EF: So I guess you began your research somewhere in the 1970s, if I&#8217;m thinking of it correctly?        JR: Mm hmm.        EF: Okay. So can you describe a bit about your research methods and the studies that you produced about Kinsey?        JR: Yeah. [Brief interruption] Well, first thing I did is I read. I read what he wrote, what he said, and it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s in his two books. Chapter five shows a two-month-old baby being masturbated, or digitally manipulated &#8211; or maybe penetrated, because later on one of his colleagues said that they did involve penetration &#8211; for a certain amount of time in order to get an orgasm. Then he has a three-month-old, four-month-old, five-month-old, six-month-old, and he lists these little children, and that&#8217;s torture. That&#8217;s what they were doing to the little babies. Tables 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and what he called&#8211;. Then I looked. I said, okay. Alright. Okay, so these are what he said, that they did over &#8211; and the timing, how long it took to get the orgasm, and the time in between orgasms of the kids, and I said okay; what did he call an orgasm?         I thought sure the guy would have not described it, but he did. Page 160 and 161. He said that there were one hundred and ninety-six children and he broke them up into six categories, six types &#8211; that&#8217;s what he called it, six types &#8211; one, two, three, four, five, six. That made it very scientific. It&#8217;s got numbers and everything, you see? Then he said that the children screamed, they cried, hysterical tears, and he put in parentheses, &#8220;Especially among the younger children.&#8221; What? What? Then he said, &#8220;And some strike the partner.&#8221; That&#8217;s the man who was raping them. Excuse me. &#8220;Strike the partner and try and get away.&#8221; Yeah? &#8220;But,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they definitely enjoy the experience because they often return to&#8211;,&#8221; and I thought, "Holy smokes! This is got to be a sadomasochistic&#8211;." Do you want to see the charts and all that?        EF: Perhaps after the interview.        JR: I said, "He has got to be a sadomasochistic pedophile." I mean, that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s got to be. There&#8217;s no human being who could describe babies writhing in pain and say that they enjoyed that as an orgasm but a sadomasochistic pedophile, so that means he was a pedophile. And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on?         EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s?        JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;.        EF: Right.        JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator.        EF: At American University, or it was funded through there?        JR: Yeah, American University.        EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;?        JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;.        EF: The president of American University?        JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don&#8217;t know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody&#8217;s going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something.         So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much. So they cut out any ability of me to research Kinsey&#8217;s work, which was ridiculous because I wasn&#8217;t experimenting. He was, but I wasn&#8217;t. I was going to look at the documents and try and find out where the children came from, because we had a lot of leads at that time. He&#8217;d gone into the orphanages and into the homes of the colored children &#8211; in those years &#8211; and so we were checking those out, but they cut our throats. They said, &#8220;No way. You&#8217;re not going to do that research.&#8221;        EF: So American didn&#8217;t allow it?        JR: Mm hmm.        EF: They didn&#8217;t publish it?        JR: No. They didn&#8217;t allow me to do the research.         EF: Oh, I see.        JR: The academic committee of respectable academics was the one that said, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t do that. You can&#8217;t.&#8221; So, okay, but they let me do the Playboy stuff.        EF: Okay.        JR: You can look at Playboy. So I figured well; if that&#8217;s all we can do that&#8217;s all we can do. So we did the research on Playboy and found that they had been sexualizing children from 1954 and had engaged in what is now known as child pornography regularly. That seems important. The public needs to know that. Grandpa and Father weren&#8217;t looking at innocuous stuff. He thought he was looking at innocuous things but they weren&#8217;t innocuous because the way they work on the brain leaves no doubt that they work on the brain. They&#8217;re what we call &#8220;flashbulb memories,&#8221; that is everyone remembers that first nude that they saw, everyone, and they remember, in those days, because it&#8217;s not like now on the iPads and everything else, and they remember where they were and who they were with when they saw that sexy image. They remember everything and they remember the cartoons. They remember all the cartoons. How do I know that? Because of a lot of research I&#8217;ve done since, but the fellow who told me about Kinsey, who said go look at Kinsey? When I saw him earlier I said, &#8220;There are kids in Playboy,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, there aren&#8217;t,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, there are,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;No, there aren&#8217;t.&#8221; He&#8217;s a psychologist and he knows. [I said,] &#8220;So you know Playboy?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Well, yeah, I&#8217;ve seen it, and there aren&#8217;t.&#8221;        EF: How were you defining&#8211;? What constituted &#8220;children?&#8221;        JR: Under eighteen.        EF: Okay.        JR: Under eighteen.        EF: Did you do research to find out who&#8211;? Like some of them were cartoons, but for those that were photos did you look into who they were?        JR: Yep. There&#8217;s a clear picture of Jodie Foster when she was fourteen, graphic, and Brooke Shields, graphic. Okay? Alright. And others. Mostly what Playboy did is they used out-cuts from [what they called] &#8220;Sex and Cinema.&#8221; They used out-cuts from foreign films or they used Hamilton&#8217;s ethereal images of coming-of-age, but they would have really rough&#8211;. Nowadays we call child pornography adults who are dressed to look like children, or people who look like children who are designed with the hair bows and all that stuff, because now they realize it&#8217;s taken this amount of time, but they realize that that is just as precipitating as the real child. So, they had a lot of that, women dressed as children, looking like children.         Alright. So, what was I saying?        EF: Well, if I could ask a follow-up question to the research that you were conducting over the years, how did your research into Kinsey and pornography, how did that translate into your public activism, political activism? Was there a relationship there or were you more strictly in the academy?        JR: Well the academy didn&#8217;t like me. [Laughs]         EF: So as a result you were more in the public light?        JR: Yeah. The academy didn&#8217;t want to produce my findings. The academy said, "We can&#8217;t do that. It&#8217;s not going to work."         I went to a couple of conferences and then every time I sent in a paper, well, they didn&#8217;t have time. No. The academy didn&#8217;t like what I was finding one bit. It was not politically correct. So, I decided to get that information out as I could, yeah.        EF: What were some of those different outlets?        JR: Well, books.        EF: Sure.        JR: I wrote my books, Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, Soft Porn Plays Hardball, Sexual Sabotage, Kinsey, Crimes and Consequences. I wrote [all those] and I wrote articles. I went to conferences where I could; presented the information the best I could. But the academy shut it out, absolutely, and I was trying to understand that, and because I was trying to understand that I understood.  I followed most of the people in the &#8211; let&#8217;s say with the power in the academy, quote &#8211;  either were users of Playboy, Penthouse, or Hustler or something like that, or were connected with the Kinsey Institute. I mean it was all interconnected, and as I began to follow why are they doing this? What is this? It&#8217;s impossible that you don&#8217;t get that information about children to the public.         I found that the Kinsey Institute was absolutely&#8211;. Oh yeah, they threatened people and they threatened to sue everybody who printed anything from me. They claimed that they had searched their files and it wasn&#8217;t true. Well they never did. They never did. It was not possible that they did. So, anybody who wanted to print anything from my stuff had that massive &#8211; with all their money &#8211; that massive institution to deal with and they were not willing to take that chance. Radio shows that were supposed to have me on were threatened and they dropped me. I was on Donahue because Donahue thought he could take me out. You know Donahue?        EF: Yeah, Phil Donahue, the Phil Donahue Show?        JR: Yeah, so he thought he could take me out, because he was very pro-Kinsey. He wrote a book with June Reinisch, who was at the time the president or the director [of the Kinsey Institute]. So he brought me on the program and he didn&#8217;t take me out at all. As a matter of fact everybody in the audience stood up, enraged, because he &#8211; that&#8217;s a good example &#8211; he did not want to put up the tables, out of Kinsey&#8217;s own book. I said, &#8220;Put up the tables, Phil. Put the tables up, Phil. Phil, put up the tables. Put up Table 34. Let the American public make their own decision.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t want to do it, and finally he put up Table 34. Well, that ended it. I mean everybody there was outraged. A five-month-old baby? A four-year-old boy, twenty-six orgasms in twenty-four hours? That&#8217;s an experiment. That&#8217;s an around-the-clock experiment. So the audience was completely on my side. He had a few, on the phone, shills that could call in at the end and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anything she says. The child is sexual from birth,&#8221; and everything, but the audience was absolutely outraged. So&#8211;        EF: About what year was this?        JR: &#8211;they would never let me on again. That was December, 1991.        EF: Okay.        JR: Yeah. There&#8217;s a transcript. I love it.        EF: Okay. Well I&#8217;m curious to know more about the way in which you were in the public light, representing this research, and the way that you were active politically. So in what other sense or in what other ways were you acting as a conservative activist or a political activist in that sort of sense?        JR: Well, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. I was trying to get the facts out to the people, and I was being blocked, and I fought it. Now the Kinsey Institute is in the UN. They are in the UN as a consultant for all nations on gender? There&#8217;s a website up now, stopkinsey.org, which has outstanding information. It&#8217;s wonderful. In Croatia we made a huge difference.        EF: Just this last week?        JR: Yeah, well this last week and then last year also.         EF: Okay.        JR: As a matter of fact they gutted the education minister, who&#8217;s given us all kinds of trouble, just this last week and they put in a human. They put in another education minister who&#8217;s pretty good, and they&#8217;re handing out my book as gifts to the teachers. I have to tell them they have to do it here. Yeah, so that&#8217;s going on.        EF: Let me ask also, looking at some of your research and articles you&#8217;ve been writing the last several years &#8211; and longer than that, I suppose &#8211; I wondered if you could give your thoughts on&#8211;. It seems like you&#8217;ve written a lot also about gay and lesbian issues.        JR: We were waiting for that, weren&#8217;t we?        EF: Well I wonder if you could speak to how your research then translated into research in that?        JR: Sure. It&#8217;s child abuse. There&#8217;s no transfer. There&#8217;s no transfer. The high rate of child abuse amongst what are called &#8220;gay and lesbian,&#8221; and what are called &#8220;transgender,&#8221; and what are called &#8220;queer,&#8221; and what are called all those other kinds of names is off the charts, except nobody wants to address that. I did my research using The Advocate. Do you know what The Advocate is?        EF: I&#8217;ve heard of it.        JR: It&#8217;s the mainstream. It&#8217;s the oldest and the mainstream homosexual magazine.        EF: Okay.        JR: You can&#8217;t get anything that&#8217;s more mainstream than The Advocate. I did research along with a statistician on The Advocate and they &#8211; admissions on their part &#8211;  twenty-one percent of their readers, who are the basically white, upscale, urban, basically these are the guys, are sexually abused before age fifteen by adults. Now, they left out sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen. The sixteen and seventeen, those years, would be your biggest abuse populations. They didn&#8217;t count those and they didn&#8217;t count older kids as abusers. Okay? Alright. Even still, twenty-one percent are talking about they were sexually abused. What are you doing? You&#8217;re turning your back on twenty-one percent?         Now, what they&#8217;ve done &#8211; and the same thing with lesbians. There was a Dutch [study], I think it was, and fifty-some percent of the kids were abused. What they do is the abused kids are mislabeled gay. What you do is you have an abused kid and instead of finding out who&#8217;s abused them and putting him in jail &#8211; you don&#8217;t see many abusers of gay kids put in jail unless they&#8217;re priests. Instead of getting the people who have violated them, the perpetrators, they say, "Oh, well, they&#8217;re gay. They&#8217;re gay." So that means they&#8217;re going to die earlier, they&#8217;re going to have all kinds of venereal diseases and everything else that they don&#8217;t need to have. Instead of protecting those children, instead of protecting those people, we&#8217;re labeling those people, labeling them. It may be politically acceptable today but it&#8217;s not going to help them. So, that&#8217;s my position.         EF: Alright. Well really I just have a few more questions. I mean we&#8217;re here at Liberty University School of Law now and I wonder how you came here.        JR: They were gracious and wonderful and said, "We will take your archive. You are welcome here."  And I believe that if there&#8217;s any saving for our country it will only come through Christians who are able to stand up for themselves and assert their beliefs properly.         Law, yeah; I ended up doing&#8211;. Okay, because then I needed to find out what happened to the laws, because my daughter didn&#8217;t want me to say anything, and when I looked she was right because of this peer, this little window&#8211;when you could sexually abuse a younger kid. So I thought, well, wait a minute. Has Kinsey changed our laws? At which point I started doing my research on the legal changes and yes; he changed our laws, radically, radically.                EF: Did he himself lobby lawmakers&#8211;        JR: Yeah, actually he did.        EF: &#8211;in DC?        JR: Yeah, yeah. He went all over. In Los Angeles they were about to tighten the laws on predators. He went to Los Angeles and he lied. He testified that children are not harmed by sexual abuse, that he had investigated thousands of children and [no, there&#8217;s no harm,] and so on and so on. As a matter of fact Kinsey acolytes, John Money and Fred Berlin, and another guy, Peterson, they advised the Catholic Church that pedophiles could be cured and could go back. So, that little tidbit was interesting.         But the main thing was the laws on rape&#8211;. Estrich &#8211; that&#8217;s her name? I&#8217;ve forgotten her first name. She wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape, and she was Dukakis&#8217;s lawyer or something. She&#8217;s very popular and she wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape and she said, &#8220;What has happened to the rape laws?&#8221; She said, &#8220;With the conservatives we had tougher penalties for rape than we have with the liberals,&#8221; and she&#8217;s very liberal. She said the America Law Institute Model Penal Code&#8211;. Do you know anything about that?        EF: Not really.         JR: It&#8217;s the code that&#8217;s gone all over the country. The Model Penal Code supplanted&#8211;. You had the Common Law and you have now a belief in science, okay, which supplanted the Common Law. Science supplanted the Common Law. Well, what science? What science? Science on rape. What science on rape? What science on child abuse? What science on divorce? What science on sodomy? The Model Penal Code from 1955, and who do they cite in the Model Penal Code a hundred percent on sodomy and on rape? The Kinsey Institute, Alfred Kinsey.         So, in 1948 half the states in the union had a penalty of death for rape &#8211; did you know that? &#8211; simple rape, not cutting off the arms, not a little kid, just a regular male-female kind of rape, the old fashioned kind. You know that&#8217;s changed. The kind of rape we deal with now has changed. It&#8217;s radically changed. But anyway, so, rape. Half the states offered the death penalty, the other half, life. You could get life for rape, and one of them you could get forty years.  Okay. What does that tell you about the attitude, the relationship between women and men at that time? You believe the woman who said she was raped because virginity was a prized property of hers. She wouldn&#8217;t say she was raped and risk the fact that she was no longer a virgin.         Kinsey came along and said: these women are all lying. They&#8217;re really promiscuous. They &#8211; fornication was against the law &#8211; they have engaged in fornication. But there&#8217;s no downside to anything. There was never a downside. He didn&#8217;t have a downside. He didn&#8217;t have abortion. He didn&#8217;t have venereal disease. He didn&#8217;t have child sexual abuse that wasn&#8217;t considered child sexual abuse. There was no downside to anything that he said we participated in. We were all promiscuous and it&#8217;s just that Grandpa and Grandma were hiding it. They were liars. Get it? So, that led me into an investigation of the laws.        EF: Right. Well thanks for recounting that. The last question I have, and I&#8217;m asking this [in] all the interviews I&#8217;m doing the next few days, talking to conservative activists, and ideas of feminism, so what does feminism mean to you?        JR: [Pause; laughs] Uh huh.        EF: If anything.        JR: [Laughs]        EF: I&#8217;m not suggesting that it must.        JR: Well, it means something. What does it mean to me? [Pause] It&#8217;s irrelevant. It&#8217;s just irrelevant.         EF: Why so?        JR: Women are reacting to their loss. They don&#8217;t know often that they&#8217;re reacting to their loss but they are.         EF: Just to clarify, loss of what?        JR: Of their womanhood, of their honor, of their integrity that they did have. There were problems pre-feminism. There were, you know. There were problems in the workplace, or there were problems in fair employment, other things that are not right, but now they&#8217;ve lost who they are as women. They&#8217;re treated like slabs of meat. This hook-up business: all part of the idea of feminism. [Sighs] And the rate of divorce, the rate of abortion, of venereal disease, all these things, they are examples of women who have come to believe frauds and who have given up their womanhood. They&#8217;ve given up their womanhood. We have a lot of women who are molesting children, women teachers molesting children. Something radical has happened to the character of our people, and this radical thing that has happened has happened to women. In my life &#8211; and it&#8217;s not imagination &#8211; women didn&#8217;t do those things. Somebody might, some weird gal might, but women, molesting children? When women start molesting children the last barrier of protection for them is gone. So, we&#8217;re in a very dangerous place.         EF: Well thanks for all the information. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to say or any questions that I should have asked that I didn&#8217;t?        JR: [Sound indicating &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;]        EF: [Laughs] I think I&#8217;m okay. I wanted to make sure there&#8217;s nothing else left unsaid.        JR: There&#8217;s a lot left unsaid.        EF: That&#8217;s always true.        JR: Just a lot left unsaid.        EF: Well thank you, Dr. Reisman, for your time.        JR: You&#8217;re welcome.
