Joey Fink: This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. I&#8217;m in Maryville, Tennessee. It&#8217;s May 20, 2011 and I'm talking with Ms. Shirley Carr Clowney. Thank you, Ms. Carr Clowney, for talking with me today.
Shirley Carr Clowney: Thank you for coming.
JF: Can you start by telling me when and where you were born?
SCC: I was born here in Blount County, in Maryville, Tennessee, a few years ago, like 1936. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs] Big family, small family? Big town, small town?
SCC: A small town. As a part of Blount County it actually was called Oldfield before the aluminum company moved here in 1913 so we were actually a part of North Maryville, a very small community, and the community that I lived in, called Oldfield as I mentioned before, was pretty much integrated. So I grew up in a different situation than many of the people here in Blount County, especially those that moved here to work at the aluminum company.
JF: Do you remember things about the Great Depression and the New Deal?
SCC: The thing that I remember most about the Depression was the fact that we had to have coupons or tokens to get things like flour and sugar. We were only allowed to have so much at a time, and the one thing that sticks in my head as a kid was that if I had a quarter I would go down to the store and by a quarter&#8217;s worth of gum to have and I would make it last for a long time. That&#8217;s one of the special memories that I have of that period of time.
JF: And how did Alcoa coming change things in the town?
SCC: In the early 1900s, around 1913 or 1917, I&#8217;m not sure of the year, the aluminum company from Pittsburgh decided to have a plant here in Blount County because it was near the Calderwood Dam. There were not very many African Americans here at that point and so they sent people to Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and had them come to work in particularly the pot room, which was very hot, and they thought that they&#8217;d be able to withstand it. Over the years several trips were made to the South to bring those people here to work at the aluminum company, and there was a little rift between those who moved here and those who were already here. It worked out though, however, and Oldfield actually became a part of Alcoa eventually.
JF: And what did your parents do?
SCC: My father worked different kinds of jobs. He worked for Proffitts, which was one of the local retail stores here. He worked on the railroad. He went to Ohio to work. He worked at the aluminum company for awhile, but my father was a very devout Christian and the aluminum company wanted them to work on Sunday and he refused. He actually then went into brick masonry, which became his livelihood, and actually was well known in Blount County. That&#8217;s why I use Carr, because people recognize that name. [Laughs] So he did masonry work around the county. My two brothers&#8212;. I didn&#8217;t mention before that I did come from a large family. There were five sons and three daughters. One son did die at two years of age. The rest of us were brought up in a very protected kind of home. We all had the opportunity to go to college if we wanted to. The two older brothers actually were in World War II. They chose not to go to college but they took up the trade of masonry with my father and worked with him throughout their lifetime. The rest of us did go to college and one brother is an engineer, one brother is a teacher, my older sister went to Knoxville College but stopped so she could help take care of my grandmother during World War II, so she never went back and finished and got her degree. However, she did open a daycare center here in Blount County. My younger sister and I both were public school teachers. So our family was a very close knit group and we still are today. Three of our siblings are deceased now and the rest of us are real tight, real close.
JF: And it sounds like there was no difference between sons and daughters in terms of education.
SCC: Absolutely, and my father only went to fourth grade but he was a self educated man. I would put him up against anybody because he would talk to you, you know, he was well read, so his goal was to be sure that his children had every opportunity they could have to become contributing citizens to society.
JF: And what did you want to do when you were younger?
SCC: I really wanted to have a boutique. I wanted to be a dressmaker, thus the reason for going into vocational home economics. As it turned out I ended up having a lot of science, a lot of psychology, a lot of English, [Laughs] a lot of math, and ended up going into the field of education. I did at times work for dress designers in New York City and I did do sewing for people on my own, but that was not really what I wanted to do. I really liked working with young people.
JF: And did you expect to get married and have children?
SCC: Now, like I said, [Laughs] this is&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know quite how to say this. We are family oriented and naturally that would have been one of the things that I ultimately wanted to do. As it turned out, went to Tennessee State and met my husband, Cato [Clowney], and we married there during school. Lived in Nashville for about seven years, I believe. Through the 1960s we were there when the students from Tennessee State went south during the &#8217;60s to protest segregation, and then in 1963 we moved to New Jersey. So, yes, family is just what I am. [Laughs]
JF: And did you think that you would work once you got married and had kids?
SCC: Well, as it turned out I did not work for the first seven years because I thought it was important to be with the children as they were growing up, and not until they went into pre-K did I work full time.
JF: All right. So, we&#8217;ll go back a little bit to high school in Maryville. Can you describe that a little bit for me?
SCC: Okay. Like I said, we lived in Oldfield. Oldfield was about one mile from the all black school, the only black school that was in this area when I came along. There happened to be another school that was very close to our house but it was all white and of course we were not allowed to go there. So I walked from Oldfield to Haw High School, which was in Alcoa proper, for twelve years. There was no bus. If it rained because my father was a brick mason of course he could not work and my father did have one of the few cars that people had back in the early &#8217;40s, so he would take all the kids in Oldfield to school, sometimes leaving us behind [Laughs] and coming back for us because they would just load in the car. No seat belts so they could cram in the car and he would take them to Haw High. That school was the only school for grades one through twelve my whole high school years.   It happened that in 1954, when Brown v. [Board of] Education was passed, that Maryville College, which had allowed blacks to attend prior to 1901, opened their doors immediately and one of the principals of the school was friends with my dad and he encouraged my dad to have me enroll in Maryville College. Well, no problem. Two of my classmates, Queen Crossing and Louise Hill [Gilmore], and I, enrolled in Maryville College, which meant we walked another two years, so for fourteen years I walked to school.
JF: [Laughs]
SCC: There was a girl from Knoxville who actually was encouraged because of the change in law to come from Knoxville to Maryville College, [and] there were two guys that enrolled, so there were six of us there from 1954 until 1956, and I think most of us felt that they really weren&#8217;t quite ready and so we didn&#8217;t&#8212;. I was valedictorian of my class in Haw High and was accustomed to getting good grades and of course grades below a C or B were just not what I wanted, and therefore that&#8217;s one of the reasons why I left. There was no problems as far as racial issues were concerned but I just did not feel that I was getting the grades that I wanted to carry with me, and so we all left. I finished Tennessee State. Nancy [Smith] Wright went to Memphis to nursing school, but she came back and graduated as the first black woman to graduate from Maryville College in 1960. That was also the same year that I graduated from Tennessee State. The one thing that I want to mention about Maryville College is that when I moved back here and became interested in history I was going through the archives at Maryville College and I noticed that the history of Maryville College had a line in the book that said, &#8220;In 1954 six blacks were enrolled in Maryville College,&#8221; period.
JF: And that&#8217;s it.
SCC: No names, nothing else. Being the person that I became after I left&#8212;. I used to be very quiet and shy, didn&#8217;t talk much and was a kind of hands on person, but that kind of got me going, so I worked with Dr. [Gerald] Gibson. It just so happened that at the time I started this it was about the time for the fiftieth anniversary of the 1958 class, and so he, being a historian also, said, you know, yeah, we need to do something about that. So what I did was we got all the people together. One person was deceased, Leo Valentine was deceased, but the other male was in Florida, Freeman Wyche, [and] was able to contact me. We got our paperwork together and pictures and what Maryville College decided to do was a plaque with our pictures that would be posted on campus, and it is now in Bartlett Hall.   So that was one of the things that moved me to correct the lack of history about the integration, and it was smooth. It was unlike Clinton or Little Rock. It was smooth. There really were no clashes. The only thing that I really remember&#8212;. The thing that I remember most about negative was going to the restaurant that was there on campus that all of the other students went to and going in there one day. We were told that we could not be served. So that was like unusual. We knew places where you could or could not go. We could not sit downstairs in the movies; we had to sit upstairs. We could not go into restaurants, or in some places you could not try on clothes or shoes, so we knew that and it was accepted. So that was disappointing because we thought the campus area was going to be more accepting of the integrated situation at that time.
JF: I&#8217;ve got a bunch of questions. You&#8217;re sparking so much in my head. Let me start, do you think that this affected academics for you, the fact that the campus integrated but not really?
SCC: It did. Actually [Laughs] we went to a school that did not offer French, no foreign language, no typing, no science above biology. We had no electives. Everybody took the same classes. So we go to Maryville College and the white students have had trigonometry, geometry, and Spanish and French, so we were ill prepared to compete with them. So we were not ready and they were not ready to work with us to bring us up to par, or at least it didn&#8217;t happen. [Laughs] So, yes.
JF: And you lived with your family.
SCC: I did.
JF: But the other students who came from farther away, where did they live?
SCC: Only one female and one male lived on campus. Queen lived across the street from me and Louise lived in Alcoa, within walking distance. Nancy had to have a room by herself and Freeman actually was not even allowed in the dorm. He lived in Bartlett Hall, part of the gym, okay. Yes. So those are different stories.

JF: And those are the stories you don&#8217;t hear, you know?
SCC: Absolutely, absolutely. When we had the portrait dedicated we were able to tell our stories and Freeman&#8217;s was one that even I had not heard, because he was on the track team and there were schools that were going to play Maryville College but once they found out he was on the team they refused to play or if they went somewhere and he was not allowed to go to a restaurant or to a place to sleep then the team might decide, okay, we won&#8217;t go if you can&#8217;t go. So he went through those kinds of things when he was on the track team, and he was a star track player, or participant.
JF: And I read in an article you did that you recall that there was an instance where you saw a cross burning, but&#8212;.
SCC: Okay. There were a couple. One was above the church on the very street that I lived on. The other one was in Alcoa proper. I honestly don&#8217;t remember seeing any&#8212;. I don&#8217;t remember any follow up from those, but they did happen, and we did live in an area where the KKK met frequently. But we were not really&#8212;. We didn&#8217;t face the kinds of things that the students at Clinton did or Little Rock so perhaps that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s little known about it, because it was peaceful. The cross burning perhaps was one of the most devastating things but not even so, and one other thing I need to say is that I went to the Daily Times to find out what was written about integration in 1954 and the comment was, we wouldn&#8217;t have written about that. That would have riled up the people. So. [Laughs]
JF: It seems like the present is replicating the past.
SCC: Mm hmm, absolutely.
JF: So it&#8217;s been important for you to have the history told.
SCC: Absolutely, positively.
JF: And I know you&#8217;ve received some awards.
SCC: Yes.
JF: Do you want to talk a little bit about some?
SCC: Oh my goodness. Well, I have, like I said, become&#8212;what&#8217;s the word I want to use?&#8212;involved in trying to tell the story that has not been told. I&#8217;ve received commendations from Knoxville a lot more than I have from this area, until recently. I have been nominated for the YWCA Tribute to Women. One year I was a nominee and two years later I got a call that I was being considered and I said you must be mistaken because I&#8217;ve already been a nominee. It turned out that I actually was one of the awardees that year and that was because of the kind of work that I do with trying to research, report and preserve the history of my people. As far as I know there is no written record of many of the significant contributions that have been made by blacks in Blount County. I&#8217;ve been Miss Bronze Woman. I received, just last year, the Anthony Dunnings Community Service Award at the Martin Luther King Center, which happened to have been at Maryville College after it just opened the new Clayton Center, so that was particularly meaningful to me that I was able to receive that award there at Maryville College. Also&#8212;now I have to think. I have been&#8212;. The Maryville Six was recognized at the Martin Luther King celebration in Knoxville the year that Obama was inaugurated. I couldn&#8217;t go then because I wanted to go to the inauguration so I could be a part of this historical movement in the history of our country, and so I missed out on that but Nancy represented us. And there have been other kinds of recognitions that have been afforded me because of the work that I do, but in it all I give God the glory because I know it&#8217;s not me. Shirley is [Laughs] just an instrument that he&#8217;s using to make people aware. And I have a book in there. I don&#8217;t know if&#8212;. That may be enough, but I&#8212;. Can we stop for a minute?
JF: Mm hmm. [Break in recording]
SCC: The AAUW of Blount County&#8212;
JF: The American Association of University Women?
SCC: &#8212;yes&#8212;recognized me and the&#8212;. There is a group called Race&#8212;I can&#8217;t remember the name of the group now. I&#8217;m getting off track. [Laughs]
JF: That&#8217;s okay.
SCC: I worked with a group on racism here in Blount County because of bullying and that kind of thing and about kids who were approached by other kids and didn&#8217;t know how to handle it, so I became instrumental as one of the facilitators for meetings here in Blount County to help those students who did not have someone to go to in cases where they were afraid or they were actually bullied. Anyway, I really am quite&#8212;you can look at that when you get a chance&#8212;quite honored and humbled at the recognitions that people are considering because I feel like our history is dying, and I&#8217;ve told myself if it&#8217;s not done in this generation it may not happen and so I am working hard to do that, and I don&#8217;t care who gets the credit as long as the work gets done. But I&#8217;m humbled.
JF: Well let&#8217;s try to get some of this history. [Laughs] So we&#8217;ll go back to 1954 to &#8217;56. You&#8217;re at Maryville College, living at home and walking to school. Were you dating then?
SCC: Not really. There was a person that I was&#8212;. We just kind of did things together. My parents were so strict that even as a college student I was not really one that could go to the movies or out to eat or anything like that. I was sheltered, completely.
JF: Why were they so strict?
SCC: I was the seventh of eight and a girl, the boys were older and my older sister was several years older than I, and I think they were just overly protective of the younger girls. So [Laughs] I did not get to do a lot of things that my peers were able to do.
JF: Did that change when&#8212;? You&#8217;ll have to forgive my ignorance but I&#8217;m not sure where Tennessee A&amp;I State University is.
SCC: Nashville.
JF: It&#8217;s in Nashville, okay.
SCC: Nashville, about two and a half, three, hours away.
JF: So in 1956 you head out to Nashville on your own?
SCC: Mm hmm.  JF: Can you tell me about that and how things changed for you?  SCC: Actually because I did transfer I was not able to live on campus, I lived in a private home, so again unlike most college kids I don&#8217;t have the on-campus experience that other college kids had. We were close, but I was not involved in extracurricular activities at Maryville College nor at Tennessee State, except for the home economics group and Baptist Training Union. So, most of my time was actually spent just trying to catch up. Going from a religious private school to a state school, of course you lost credits and so much of my time was spent really trying to catch up. It was at Tennessee State that I met my husband and we did get married there and still [Laughs] I&#8217;m pretty much not into the extracurricular or the social side of campus life.  JF: What was the home like that you lived in when you got to Nashville?  SCC: There were, let&#8217;s see, about eight of us that lived there and the Ashworths were used to having college kids there. We had a separate entrance to the upstairs level, although a couple did live downstairs. It was a well kept home. They were religious people and so they took&#8212;. They embraced us as their kids, so that was good.  JF: Were there rules and curfews?  SCC: Oh, absolutely. [Laughs]  JF: I&#8217;m assuming it was all female?  SCC: Yes. Yes, there were, and we didn&#8217;t have any instances that were unusual as far as I can remember. There was a church next door and being a church person that was convenient. I didn&#8217;t really get involved in the activities but I did go to church.  JF: What church was it?  SCC: Friendship Baptist Church, on 33rd in Nashville, and right now that church has grown and our house is gone. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] Okay, so you were at Tennessee State University, 1956 to&#8212;.  SCC: Actually I got married and stayed out a year and went back and finished in 1960.  JF: And during that time I&#8217;m noticing you had&#8212;.  SCC: Three children.  JF: Three children.  SCC: Mm hmm, yeah, and all of our children all attended Tennessee State. The oldest girl and the next one graduated. The younger one went one year and decided that was not for him. He&#8217;s doing better than those who graduated, quite frankly, at this point in life, so that&#8217;s interesting. [Laughs] So he&#8217;s making fifty grand plus a year. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] Good for him. Good to hear some good stories and good news in these times. So you met your husband, Cato, and what did he do or what was he studying to do?  SCC: He was in agriculture, having come from west Tennessee where they grew a lot of cotton and farming. That was his pursuit and after we got married though he needed fifteen hours to graduate but didn&#8217;t&#8212;to get a degree, I should say. So that&#8217;s how that turned out. [Laughs] But it hasn&#8217;t affected him because he went into retail and was actually a regional merchandiser for Kmart for many years, worked for Sears. While we were in school though he was a chef&#8212;not a chef but worked in one of the downtown hotels in Nashville, so that was his livelihood for awhile until we moved to New Jersey. So the degree has not really made a difference because like right now he is actually the vice president of the Beck Cultural Center in Knoxville, which is going through some interesting challenges right now. He also works with the Literacy Imperative which provides books for people in Knoxville. He&#8217;s worked with the Rotary Club. So he&#8217;s in the service area and the degree has not kept him from performing, or the lack of a degree, I should say.  JF: How did you two end up out in New Jersey?  SCC: Well actually you know jobs were not really available in home economics. The teachers stayed in their jobs until they died. [Laughs] I was substituting and my brother was actually at Fort Monmouth as an engineer and he allowed me to come up there during the summer when I was at Maryville College to work. I worked in clothing factories, [32:00 Jerry Tupman], I don&#8217;t know even how I remember that name from 1955, but I worked in a clothing factory in New Jersey in the summer while I was attending Maryville College. So when he moved there&#8212;no, he was still there in &#8217;63. Let me get this straight now. Yes, they had moved there and I decided well let me go to New Jersey, and so we did. I worked setting up a store in one of the malls for one month and a person that I met there told me about a teaching job and I applied and was accepted.   One thing I need to mention about New Jersey, when I was interviewed by the superintendent of schools one of the questions that I remember so distinctly was, how do you think you will relate to a classroom of white students, because those schools were not that&#8212;. They were integrated but predominantly Caucasian. When he asked that question I don&#8217;t know if I really remember exactly what I said, but I had to let him know that I had been in integrated situations and that I did not expect to have any problem whatsoever. [Laughs] I was hired. [Laughs] I worked in a second grade for two years; I worked in a middle school for about four years; and then the rest of the time in high school.  JF: What was the name of the school district?  SCC: The first school district was Middletown Township but I ended up in Monmouth Regional High School, which was in Monmouth County in New Jersey.  JF: What part of Jersey is that?  SCC: It&#8217;s south of Newark, north of Atlantic City. It&#8217;s on the shore area where Asbury Park, Spring Lake and the shore part of New Jersey.  JF: How would you characterize those communities? Were they working class?  SCC: Basically. Fort Monmouth was actually the army base and that&#8217;s what the school was named for, Monmouth Regional High School, and the student body was a transit body&#8212;.  I don&#8217;t know how to say that, but there were students that came from all over the world, okay? I had students that could not speak English and so I was in a unique situation in some cases, but I would say that it was a working class community, or town&#8212;township, they called them&#8212;and integrated.   So we lived in an all black community for about seven years and then we moved to a new development that there were only two African American families in that development and that&#8217;s where our kids pretty much went to school. Also, because they were a small minority in their elementary, middle, and high school I thought it was important for them to have the black experience, which is why they came back to Tennessee State from New Jersey to go to school. They have stayed in New Jersey even though we retired back home. Because I had family here and because the taxes were lower we moved back, but they have chosen to stay there because the jobs are much better, and so we go back and forth. When our grandchildren were born they would always come here and we had what we called Mom-Mom and Pop-Pop summer camp.  JF: [Laughs]  SCC: Downstairs was where they stayed and they had their own little area. We had dress up clothe, and they would go fishing; they would do all kinds of fun things, and they called it summer camp. I want you to know that they came here every year until the last two years. Now the oldest one is twenty-one but until&#8212;. Even when they went to college they still wanted to come here. One of the granddaughters got a job in high school and she said, but I go to Tennessee for two weeks so I need two weeks, and they let her have it and she came. They would always come, and sometimes we&#8217;d have six here at one time for the whole summer, from June through September.   JF: That&#8217;s great.  SCC: So we&#8217;ve had some interesting experiences as grandparents. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] I&#8217;m going to ask you more about being a parent and a grandparent, but I&#8217;m going to back you up a little bit and ask you about the Civil Rights Movement. Obviously you lived part of it, being part of the integration process at Maryville, and then you were in Nashville for several years and then New Jersey. Can you tell me memories, things that stand out to you, reflections as you think back?  SCC: One of the things about Blount County that I remember is that to go to Knoxville on the bus, which was called the White Star Lines, we had to sit in the back of the bus. A lot of people don&#8217;t remember that; I do. We, as I mentioned earlier, could go to the theater uptown but we had to buy our tickets on the side and then we had to go upstairs and sit in the balcony to watch a movie. Those are two of the things that stand out most to me. The other thing is that we got books in Haw High School from the white school, they were used books, and we never had a science lab. We may have had a&#8212;what do you call it, that you look through?  JF: Microscope?  SCC: A microscope or two, but we did not have the scientific equipment that the Alcoa school had. Now we had a beautiful choir and they would sometimes go to the Alcoa school to sing and they would look in the classrooms and they would say well, you know, they all have individual desks but we have to sit two to a desk, and they would be old desks that had come from the other school. So much of our education and much of our experiences were secondhand. The one thing that I will say about schooling in Alcoa was that the teachers knew us. They knew our parents. They were interested in us. They basically knew what we could or could not do, and I think that was something that has really been a big point in the success that some of us have had. So those kinds of things I remember vividly.   I was able to work in a store uptown for awhile. I cleaned house for a family that owned grocery stores in Maryville. As a matter of fact the woman just died about three weeks ago and I went to see her and she remembered me. I had not seen her probably in thirty, forty years and I walked in and I said, &#8220;Mrs. Frein, do you know who I am?&#8221; She says, &#8220;Yes, Shirley.&#8221; She says, &#8220;I read about you in the paper. I keep some of your articles.&#8221; She was ninety-six years old. So I worked for them and did their housecleaning and everything and I worked for people who had furniture stores here, but that was the kind of thing I could do, basically, and that was before I was allowed to work in one of the stores downtown.  JF: When you were in high school?  SCC: Mm hmm, and part of the two years that I was at Maryville College. One of the things that I do appreciate about my dad is that we did not have to work while we were in school. We didn&#8217;t have to have loans, government loans. He made sure that we were able to go to school, study, and not have to worry about working. That&#8217;s a plus that I&#8217;ll always be grateful for.  JF: So while you were in Nashville you didn&#8217;t have to work?  SCC: No.  JF: That&#8217;s great.  SCC: No, I didn&#8217;t.  JF: Your father sounds like a wonderful man.  SCC: Well, considering what we&#8217;re going through now with our grandchildren, [Laughs] that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so appreciative, because it&#8217;s hard for them. Could I mention our grandchildren?  JF: Please.  SCC: We have a grandson that just graduated from SCAD in 2010.  JF: What&#8217;s SCAD?  SCC: SCAD is Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia. One month after he graduated he got to go to California to do an internship. That was July of 2010. This month&#8212;no, April, 2011, he got a job paying forty dollars an hour at a movie company&#8212;oh, help me remember. But anyway, [Laughs] that&#8217;s out of college.  JF: Wow.  SCC: His brother just graduated from Culinary Institute of America. Two weeks after he graduated he went out to stay with his brother. He is now working in a penthouse restaurant in one of the hotels in Los Angeles and loves it. Honest to goodness. But they had it rough trying to keep two kids in college at one time. So anyway, God has been good. I&#8217;m so grateful. And with so many young black males not finding their way, it really brings tears to my eyes to think that they have stuck with it, been successful in getting employment and being on their own. So, anyway. [Laughs]  JF: That&#8217;s great.  SCC: It&#8217;s a real blessing. Their younger sister graduates from high school in June. She has not found herself yet so we&#8217;re working with her. She&#8217;s not been accepted in a school yet, but she&#8217;s going to make it.  JF: It sounds like they have a great support network in your family.  SCC: And that makes all the difference in the world. It really does. Actually there have been so many things, like when Christopher, the one who graduated from SCAD, went to California he had a car that was in New Jersey and he wanted to drive it back to California but his other grandfather on his father&#8217;s side said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good idea. You let your brother have that car and I&#8217;ll give you money to buy you one when you fly back to California.&#8221; He actually had a one-way ticket to New Jersey to [drive] the car back and that&#8217;s what happened, so talk about a support system. So we&#8217;ve been truly blessed and we&#8217;re really proud of the young people that we&#8217;ve been able to work with and support. So, yeah&#8212;excuse me. [Laughs] God is good.  JF: Indeed. So you&#8217;ve worked with young people all your life.  SCC: Basically, yes: In the church, in Sunday school; I&#8217;ve been director of Christian education; I&#8217;ve been over the vacation Bible school; I&#8217;ve taught Baptist Training Union classes. When I was at Monmouth Regional I was a field hockey coach. I went with the senior class on senior class trips. I was a go-getter. I liked to be involved. We went canoeing and rafting and horseback riding, so the whole gamut I&#8217;ve pretty much been into and worked with children of all ages. When I taught at Monmouth Regional we had a nursery as a part of the home economics department and the high school girls would actually teach four- and five-year-olds, so we would do all kinds of things with them on field trips and picnics and things like that. So, yes, I just thoroughly enjoy working with young people.   JF: Let me ask you about coaching field hockey. Was that for the school or was it intramural?  SCC: No, it was school. They played different teams. The interesting thing about that is I had never seen a field hockey game in my life, but some of the black girls would talk about how they were trained and taught and for some reason I had this urge to learn how to coach field hockey, so I worked with the field hockey coach and they actually let me do it. I did it for ten years, and a couple of years were years where not my team but the varsity team&#8212;I was JV&#8212;won the championship. So that was where I really went out on a limb doing something that I knew absolutely nothing about and was pretty successful. [Laughs]  JF: Wow. What were the attitudes towards female athletic programs in the school?  SCC: Well, I&#8217;m going to tell you one thing that I remember. Here they do not pay extra for coaching. There I actually made as much as people who had degrees above mine because I was given a stipend for coaching, just September, October, and November, so it was good. As far as I remember those salaries were basically across the line for male and female coaches.  JF: That&#8217;s great. What years would this have been?  SCC: 1975 until about &#8217;85, because I came out in &#8217;91.  JF: Wow. Do you think Title IX, the legislation in 1974 that mandated that women athletics had to be treated equally&#8212;?  SCC: That may have had an impact because there they have unions and so they were able to negotiate, and that&#8217;s one thing [Laughs] that I think is so important because yes that made a big difference. I&#8217;m not sure exactly but I would feel that it did play a part.  JF: So you were part of the teachers union?  SCC: Oh yes.  JF: Can you tell me about that?  SCC: I don&#8217;t know a whole lot except that we had people who were well read, who were vocal, who knew the law, who could go in and negotiate, and we really&#8212;. I think I remember one time where we had to actually picket but most of the time we had people on the state level and on the local level who could work with the bodies, the school bodies, and get what was best for us. And actually I&#8217;m still the recipient of that because the New Jersey pension is just absolutely different from Tennessee.  JF: So how were you approached to join the&#8212;? Let me back up and ask&#8212;.  SCC: Actually if you were a teacher you were pretty much a part of it.  JF: Yeah.  SCC: I mean there&#8217;s no solicitation or anything. It&#8217;s just that&#8217;s the way the system is set up.  JF: And did you know anything about unions, had any experience with them?  SCC: Not really, no. I just kind of fell into the system. There were people, in fact I just talked with one of the teachers a couple weeks ago that I was friendly with and she could talk to me about almost anything, investments, what&#8217;s going on here, how we need to work together. She was just a very intuitive person, and I still call her now about things. That&#8217;s how I kind of fell into it but, no. Like I said I used to be quiet [Laughs] and I didn&#8217;t get involved unless I really had to.  JF: Let&#8217;s see. Did the Vietnam War affect you personally or politically at all?  SCC: What years&#8212;? The one thing&#8212;. I&#8217;m trying to remember Vietnam. Was that like &#8217;65, in that era?  JF: &#8217;65 was when it really heated up and more troops were sent.  SCC: There was one person from Blount County who was a POW and once he got out&#8212;. Wait a minute. I have to go back to &#8217;58, I mean &#8217;54&#8212;was that Vietnam?&#8212;because one of the summers that I went to New Jersey this POW drove up there. [Laughs] We were kind of seeing each other and he drove to New Jersey while I was up there working at [52:08 Jerry Tupman&#8217;s]. It must have been Vietnam. I get my years mixed up. But I did kind of date a guy that was a POW and as a matter of fact I drove his car quite a bit. The years are not&#8212;but it had to be between &#8217;54 and &#8217;56, so that&#8217;s basically what I remember about that era. My brothers were in World War II. No, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s here right now.  JF: Do you remember any anti-war demonstrations or protests?  SCC: Not where I was. Read about them, but did not get involved in any of them, no.  JF: And what did you think about the sort of big news stories in the &#8217;60s around the Civil Rights Movement, the Freedom Summer and the Civil Rights Act?  SCC: We were living in a house on campus at Tennessee State and one of my husband&#8217;s cousins was actively involved in the movement, marching through downtown Nashville. He boarded the bus to Mississippi. He actually was one of the ones who was expelled from Tennessee State because they took part in that Civil Rights Movement. Two years ago they&#8212;and by the way the one I&#8217;m talking about is deceased now, but the rest of them were awarded honorary doctorate degrees because they see it differently now than they did at that time when they were expelled from school because of their involvement in the movement.   JF: Were they expelled because of their politics or because their politics interfered with school?  SCC: I&#8217;m not sure I can answer that correctly, but they were. I was there at Tennessee State the year that they were honoring them, now, okay, for being bold enough to do what they did. But it wasn&#8217;t the thing to do in the &#8217;60s, so I&#8217;ve seen that kind of transition in thought.  JF: Can I ask you a couple questions about the &#8217;70s?  SCC: Okay. Let me see. I moved from Middletown Township in 1969 to Monmouth Regional High School and most of&#8212;. Monmouth Regional, if I remember correctly, was about seventy-five percent Caucasian and twenty-five percent African American, and I don't know what you&#8217;re looking for, but most of my classes were Caucasian students. I had very few African American students. There were students that I felt like I became a surrogate mother to, to the point that one of them actually stayed with us for awhile because she was having difficulties with her parents. I don&#8217;t know how I got through that but that was one thing that I did during the &#8217;70s.  JF: Did she run away from home?  SCC: No. It was okay with her mom. I think it was her dad that she was having problems with, and I was part of the family&#8217;s discussions, so it wasn&#8217;t that kind of thing. It was just like out of that situation for a period of time. So I remember that particularly and I think it also was during that time that some of the students were coming to talk to me because they may not have had good relationships with some of the other teachers, which is why I said earlier I went into coaching field hockey. So that was during that time period. I&#8217;m not sure anything else comes to my memory.  JF: What did you teach?  SCC: Vocational home economics. Most of the time I taught child development&#8212;it was called child development&#8212;I taught foods classes, I taught clothing classes, but my favorite was independent living or survival skills, where juniors and seniors took classes to learn how to perform in the real world. In independent living we did all of these areas. I&#8217;d have professionals come in and talk about interviewing, about reading a&#8212;when you want to sign a lease or something. I would take them to furniture stores to learn how furniture is made, how to look for different things when you were purchasing furniture. I&#8217;d have bank people come in and talk about check writing and balancing a checkbook and investing, and in fact we had some of the students who actually started their own, I won&#8217;t say portfolio, but started getting into investing in high school. So that was probably my favorite thing.  JF: That&#8217;s great.  SCC: We did cooking; we did sewing; we did interviewing; we did basic life skills.  JF: Was it boys and girls?  SCC: Boys and girls.  JF: Did you have anything comparable to that when you were growing up?  SCC: No. I had sewing, and that&#8217;s where my heart was, sewing. That was it. The boys took shop, the girls took sewing.   JF: Then in the &#8217;70s you had co-ed classes, both boys and girls learning how to live on their own.  SCC: Oh yes. Two things that I remember out of a cooking class, I went to Hawaii&#8212;. I like to travel, I&#8217;ve been to ten different countries and I went to Hawaii where one of my students was, in high school, and went to CIA and was a chef in Hawaii, pretty much out of school, just like my grandson. And so when we went to Hawaii one of the persons with me was his first grade teacher, I was his high school teacher, and we were able to go to his place of business there in Hawaii, and that was super special. There is another one that is in Florida right now that was in one of my classes and one of the things that I really want to mention out of the independent class was this one boy called Robert Williams. I don&#8217;t remember names. [Laughs] So for me to call his name meant that it&#8217;s deep. He was a terrible student, the only person I can remember during my entire years of teaching that I would cry. I would go home and drive around before I&#8217;d go in to deal with my kids. He graduated from Monmouth Regional, went to Texas to study to be a&#8212;EMI?&#8212;an emergency person.  JF: EMT?  SCC: EMT. Didn&#8217;t hear from him for awhile. He came back to New Jersey and we talked. In the last few years he has started writing me. He says, &#8220;I know&#8221;&#8212;and I have that letter somewhere&#8212;&#8220;that I gave you a hard time and that I was a really bad student in class, but I want you to know that I have my survival book with me and I use it.&#8221; Do you know that this person still emails me and does Facebook? That was from the &#8217;70s. He&#8217;s big, he&#8217;s huge, but he still is in touch with me.  JF: That&#8217;s beautiful.  SCC: I mean, like I said, no kid ever made me cry [Laughs] like Robert did.  JF: [Laughs]  SCC: So, yeah, that&#8217;s the &#8217;70s. Two days ago I got a graduation card from one of my student&#8217;s daughters who just graduated from Hampton. She was number one in her class, she was on four different honor societies, she&#8217;s in communications, and may be working with CNN. This was one of my student&#8217;s kids and she sent me the invitation.  JF: That&#8217;s great.  SCC: It goes back to the &#8217;70s. It&#8217;s awesome when you think you&#8217;ve touched somebody&#8217;s life and thirty, forty, fifty years later they still remember you.  JF: Absolutely.   SCC: It&#8217;s awesome. See, I get carried away. I&#8217;m sorry.  JF: That&#8217;s great. I want to hear about what&#8217;s important to you. I mean I have my questions and what I want to know but I want to hear about what&#8217;s important to you.  SCC: Well I just&#8212;I get going. Go ahead. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] Well I&#8217;m struck by the young girls in the &#8217;70s getting this knowledge and learning skills about living on their own, and&#8212;.  SCC: Girls and boys.  JF: Girls and boys, but I wonder if there&#8217;s a difference between the kind of opportunities available to young women when you were a teenager and young adult versus the young women in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s.  SCC: We had a much harder time. We had to find our way. We did not have access to the kinds of things that those kids did, just not available. As I mentioned earlier we didn&#8217;t even have classes that would help prepare us. As a result though&#8212;and I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;though&#8221;&#8212;not many of my classmates finished college. I may be the only one. Most of them went on to college and their kids went to college, so there&#8217;s a difference. Don&#8217;t get me going. [Laughs]  JF: Did you witness or were you part at all of the women&#8217;s movement in the &#8217;70s?  SCC: I&#8217;m trying to remember. I think it was in &#8217;73 that I decided to join the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, which is a service sorority, and the headquarters was in Washington, DC, and some of their initiatives were for women&#8217;s rights. I did not personally go to Washington to march with them but there were activities going on at that time that were especially focused on women&#8217;s rights.  JF: What did women&#8217;s rights mean to you?  SCC: Being able to do what you want to do without restrictions, that if it&#8217;s out there and it&#8217;s available I should be able to do it if that&#8217;s what I want. That&#8217;s it in a nutshell.  JF: Mm hmm. That&#8217;s good; I like it. Do you remember any demonstrations or local activities?  SCC: In the &#8217;70s?  JF: Or in the &#8217;80s.  SCC: I think basically what I remember is what I read about, not been a part of or actually seen, because when we lived in Nashville there were lots of movements and lots of activities. I don&#8217;t think those kinds of movements were popular in New Jersey.   JF: You mean like active sort of visible protests and demonstrations?  SCC: Yes. So I can&#8217;t recall right at this moment anything that I could convey to you right now.  JF: In the teachers union did they talk about any issues that women teachers had to deal with specifically because they&#8217;re women, like maternity leave or child care or anything?  SCC: You know I think in the North those kinds of issues were kind of dealt with without any problems. It was understood: You had a child, you needed six weeks out, and the board would hire someone to take your place until you came back, so that was a part of the negotiations, and I don&#8217;t remember anything being underhanded or a real problem.   JF: Was the union then a support or helpful for that?  SCC: Yes, yes, one of the advantages [Laughs] of a union. I must say that there was a time when the New Jersey state head of the union had some issues that had to be dealt with. I just don&#8217;t remember what the particular issue was. There were tough times but the union usually got, or there was a compromise that was satisfactory, that was agreed upon. But I&#8217;m glad I was in a union. [Laughs] I&#8217;m glad they fought for what is right.  JF: And your kids would have been in their teenage years in the &#8217;70s and early '80s.  SCC: Mm hmm.  JF: Can you tell me a little bit about parenting and what you had to deal with? What were things that were frustrating or challenging? [Laughs]  SCC: Frustrating? Actually when they were in high school we were living in this community that I told you there were just a couple of African Americans there, and we weren&#8217;t near a bus line or anything, we weren&#8217;t within walking distance of most places, so my husband and I would have to physically take them wherever they needed to go. The daughter played basketball, the older son did just a little football but not much, and the other one just did intramurals, so they weren&#8217;t really a big problem because we stayed so busy doing so many other things. I mean we would take them on trips or we would take them to the beach or we would take them to New York to a show or something like that, so their time was occupied with things that we chose for them to do and therefore we didn&#8217;t have problems, except one. The youngest son, and to this day I don&#8217;t know how it happened, but he was accused of having a camera in his book bag. He tells us that someone planted it there so he&#8217;d get caught with it, and we did have to go to the police station about that. That was one thing that we had to deal with that was a little frustrating. Like I said, to this day I don&#8217;t know if he did it or if someone did plant it on him, but we worked through it. My daughter, who was the oldest one, was at the high school, at Ocean Township High School, and I think one of the students called her the &#8220;N word.&#8221; She&#8217;s a big girl [Laughs] and so she jacked the person up against the lockers and let them know. She didn&#8217;t hit them or anything but she [Laughs] you know: I don&#8217;t take that. I don&#8217;t know exactly what she said but I do know that that student didn&#8217;t bother her anymore. [Laughs] So those are two things that just kind of stand out. Now the oldest son was a wrestler and he came to his locker after one of the wrestling matches and some kids had urinated on his stuff, so, yeah, we&#8217;ve gone through stuff. But they&#8217;re none the worse off for it.   JF: What kind of advice or counseling would you give to them? What were your mantras as a mom?  SCC: Well basically it&#8217;s you know who you are. You don&#8217;t really have to worry about what anybody else thinks about you; just be yourself. We never had them to stand up for themselves in a defensive, physical manner. Deal with things the best way you can. If you can&#8217;t handle it then you go to somebody else. Don&#8217;t try to take it in your own hands. But just do unto others as you&#8217;d have them do unto you. That&#8217;s my mantra really. And I&#8217;ve pretty much grown up with that, all my life. Basically they&#8217;ve been pretty good kids. [Laughs] They live within three miles of each other in New Jersey and they look out for each other. The youngest one is a little&#8212;he&#8217;s a little evil. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  SCC: But he has a heart of gold.   JF: Can you tell me some ways that you feel like things were different for you, in terms of opportunities available, educational experiences, relationships with your husband and your family, how they were different for you from say your mom and her generation?  SCC: Okay. My mother got to stay at home. She didn&#8217;t have to go out and work. She was home when we got home from school. We sat down at the breakfast table and had breakfast together, going out with prayer, and on Sunday mornings we stood around the table while my dad prayed and each one of us said our own separate Bible verse. When my dad came home from work we would sit down and have dinner together. My mom cooked a full meal for breakfast and dinner. But before we walked that mile to school we got up, made our bed, got ready to go, got dressed, we had to dust the whole house, we had to mop the floors, we had to do the breakfast dishes, put them away, before we walked to school that mile, and I&#8217;m glad for that.   When we got married I was still going to school and still trying to take care of the little one that had come and life was a little hectic. I remember the five of us living off of seventy-five dollars a week and rent was seventy-five dollars a month. I had to be very creative. I used to sew. I even made my husband&#8217;s and my sons&#8217; suits&#8212;  JF: Wow.  SCC: &#8212;actually, and I still have one of them, because times were hard. If people think times are hard now, tell them to try to live off of seventy-five dollars a week with five people.  JF: [Laughs]  SCC: So from that though my dad kind of instilled in me the importance of saving and so being in&#8212;. Making the move to New Jersey was absolutely the thing that needed to happen to me. Five years before we decided we were going to retire and move back to Tennessee I started saving half of my salary and putting it into different funds. What I wanted to do when I retired was to travel and because I was able to funnel things and to manage the household and to keep the kids going things just kind of fell into place. I have been to eleven countries, I&#8217;ve been to many islands, I&#8217;ve been to Hawaii, and those experiences have made all the difference in the world in how I perceive things now, how I look at things, how I accept things. I&#8217;ve never been one to say, oh, I can&#8217;t do this. I&#8217;m always one that says if there&#8217;s a way I&#8217;m going to find it. So I&#8217;m very grateful that I have been able to manage to save, to sacrifice, and to pray hard [Laughs] that I could do some of the things that I really wanted to do, the kinds of things that mean something to me. Last year I went to Africa on a medical mission. That experience has really changed my life. You can see something in a book or on a screen but to actually be there and see the poverty that exists will give you a whole new outlook on life and help you not to take so much for granted. [With emotion] I feel like I&#8217;ve had just a very rich experience, that God has truly blessed me to be a blessing to someone else and to kind of help me to see what he can do through you when he lays his hands on you and says, you&#8217;re mine. You&#8217;re to do this. I&#8217;m going to help you. It&#8217;s just very humbling. I&#8217;m grateful, I&#8217;m truly grateful, and I hope that I can leave a legacy for others, to just reach out and touch somebody and to make a difference wherever they can, whenever they can, however they can. That&#8217;s Shirley.   JF: And what have been some of the most important issues or concerns for you? What are some of the things that you would really love to see changed, or some of the changes you have seen that have been really important to you?  SCC: I don&#8217;t know. There are so many things going on in my head right now. There is a group in Alcoa called HOME Inc. It&#8217;s Hall Oldfield Maryville [Empowerment] Incorporated, and it&#8217;s a group of people who have come together with the goal of helping the community to&#8212;thank you&#8212;to&#8212;.  JF: I carry them around because sometimes I get going. [Laughs]  SCC: Oh, really? [Laughs] I didn&#8217;t mean to do this.  JF: No, no, no. Please.  SCC: To help the people in the community, the Hall community, to come together and to for one thing get rid of drugs or diminish the amount of drugs that flow through the community, to help people who are having a hard time with their houses. We have a group that is building ramps or putting roofs on or doing insulation, that kind of thing. So I really hope that this group can be instrumental in bringing the community together and working together.   One of the problems with African Americans is it seems that there&#8217;s that crab mentality, you see somebody going up and you want to pull them down instead of pushing them up, and so that is one of the things that I really wish could change. I mean we&#8217;ve seen people come here from other countries and they stick together and they save and they do things as a group that would make them more&#8212;what&#8217;s the word I want? They can succeed in doing things because they work together. That is one of my dreams; that we can work together. I have a hard time in this community. There are people who look at me and say, who does she think she is? What&#8217;s she going to do next? Every time I look up she&#8217;s in the paper. If I paid attention to that I would not do anything, but I&#8217;m bigger than that, but I have to live through that because it&#8217;s a reality. They don&#8217;t want to see you do well. They talk about my house; they talk about my car; they talk about me traveling; they talk about me going to Knoxville to church, because I can&#8217;t go to church here because I won&#8217;t get the training. I won&#8217;t be able to grow spiritually because of lack of preparation on the part of the ministers. And I&#8217;m getting old, I&#8217;m getting tired of driving over there, and gas is expensive, but I want to go and get something that is going to help me and I can&#8217;t get it here. So I wish that there would be more training, whatever, so that the community here would afford everybody what they need in order to grow and to succeed, so that&#8217;s a goal.   One of the things that I am working on now is to do a pictorial of blacks in Blount County. As far as I know there is no history of our people, and I am determined that God gives me strength, the grace, and the wherewithal to do a publication because our history is unknown. I don&#8217;t know if you know or not that in 1869, 1868, there was a black mayor in Maryville. I did not know that until a few years ago. It was not taught in our schools. There is a marker up on Main Street across from the McCammon-Ammons Funeral Home on the corner of the St. Andrews Church that tells about this black mayor, William Bennett Scott. I drove by that marker; I never paid any attention to it. A few years ago they were building the Maryville municipal building and I got a call. They want to put a portrait of William B. Scott in the municipal building. I had done research and they knew that. There was no image of William B. Scott. He was a controversial figure in 1869 and perhaps even then they may not have had the wherewithal to take pictures and keep them and that kind of thing, and so I had to do extensive research of his family and ended up with a family portrait of a fiftieth reunion or anniversary, which had several men in it, and they had similar features. So the city of Maryville commissioned an artist to do this portrait. So I worked with her and was able to come up with this portrait so that she could use them to configure William B. Scott. He is now hanging in the Maryville municipal building. It took me two years. There were people in the city who were not too sure that it should be done. One said to me, what if we put him looking this way and we find out down the road he looked another way? I said it won&#8217;t matter. He gets the honor that he deserves. But I had to go through that kind of thing. When the portrait was done the artist was not doing hands too well [Laughs] and the face did not look like the hands and so they didn&#8217;t put it up and I didn&#8217;t realize that. I went there to take some people there from New Jersey to see it and it&#8217;s not there, so I said, where is the portrait, and found out it was sitting somewhere in a room and I had to work again to be sure that they did the hands and got it up. His mother was white, his father was black, and they wanted to be sure that he looked the way he was supposed to. Well, you know, [Laughs] when you don&#8217;t have an image you do the best way you can to give him his due. He had been honored before with a picture of his grandson, Cansler, and that&#8217;s what they had been using.   But anyway, that was one of my goals and right now my goal is to get in print some of these significant contributions that blacks have made, not only to Blount County but to the United States, so that&#8217;s my goal. [Pause; sound of papers] Now if people don&#8217;t know where they come from they may not be able to know where they&#8217;re going, and so I really am interested in helping people reach their goals, know their history, and to be contributing citizens in this day and time. I thought I might have William B. Scott in here but&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know how I could have missed that. It&#8217;s somewhere. But anyway, that&#8217;s me.  JF: I should probably say for the record right now that Ms. Carr Clowney is looking through a big binder that she showed me of articles and clippings from the newspaper that relate to her and her work and her place in the community.   You know it&#8217;s interesting the way you&#8212;. I thought it was really insightful of you to talk about the way community can be a positive thing and it can be a negative thing, because a lot of times when people write about social movements or activists or path breakers the community is such a source of strength and support that maybe we don&#8217;t have as complete or as accurate of a picture as we should of the many different ways community can affect an individual.  SCC: Mm hmm.  JF: Would you like to see community talked about a little bit differently in history?  SCC: Oh absolutely. There have been just a couple of people who have written things that speak to community and I just don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough positive emphasis put on the community. The Times did [1:29:33] and all of them were negative and I just feel that there is a&#8212;. This is a time now to build up, not to tear down. I believe that the Center for Strong Communities at Maryville College, which has now disbanded, I thought was doing an excellent job in reaching out and helping the communities to come together. So yes, there definitely is a need, and I&#8217;m hoping that somebody in this generation is going to rise up to the task. We very often look to people like Martin Luther King, Jr. and we wonder why there&#8217;s not someone else who has taken his place, and I don&#8217;t know the answer to that but I really think that it&#8217;s important for communities to work in harmony and to build stronger communities. [Whispers] I don&#8217;t know if I answered your question or not.  JF: Absolutely. Maybe just one more question and then I&#8217;ll turn it over to you to say anything you&#8217;d like to add or close with. You said you were at President Obama&#8217;s inauguration?   SCC: Mm hmm.  JF: Can you describe that a little bit for me?  SCC: Oh, that was an interesting thing. I had tickets to get in and I had the program&#8212;that&#8217;s the ticket over there, I think&#8212;and what happened is I went with some people who did not have tickets. It was extremely cold that day. We stayed with some people who lived just outside of DC, who knew the area, and I was supposed to meet some people in Knoxville and go to the inauguration and sit in my seat. That did not happen. I let someone else use my tickets as long as they were going to give them back to me. We went there and ended up on the wrong side and so what happened is the people who lived there took us to her church and we were able to see it on the video, on the screen. So we got pretty close but not close enough, and it was extremely cold that day. So I was there [Laughs] but I didn&#8217;t get inside. We were outside the gate, right where the limousines were and everything, some of them, not the ones they were in. But I was there and it was meaningful to me because of the historical relevance to this generation, to this time. I have a whole case full of memorabilia that, you know, right now&#8212;.  JF: Save that. Don&#8217;t throw that away. [Laughs]  SCC: I know, I know, I know. It&#8217;s right there. You would not believe the stuff that I have collected beside the&#8212;[1:32:44 that&#8217;s expensive, and her too.]  JF: She points to the statues.  SCC: Some day&#8212;and you&#8217;re right.  JF: Now can you remember some of the things you were talking about to the people you were with on that day?  SCC: I think everybody was just kind of like in awe. I mean is this real, do we need to pinch ourselves to be sure that this is really happening, that Obama is actually going to be the forty-fourth President of these United States of America? And so the atmosphere was one of, you know: Halleluiah. It&#8217;s happening, and we&#8217;re here; we&#8217;re a part of it. So much of it was we are making history, we are a part of history, so I think that was the general air or atmosphere for people who were talking. We went to the state dinner. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what you call them or not, but we went to the Tennessee one and dressed up in our gala outfits and met the Senator from Tennessee and had a wonderful time. So that was probably as close as we came to really being, you know, integrated into some of the important people who were there. But it was a rich experience and I&#8217;m glad that I was able to take a part in it.  JF: And Michelle Obama is just an amazing&#8212;  SCC: She really is.  JF: &#8212;figure, just a real role model, I think.  SCC: Absolutely. I heard her speak in Iowa at the graduation exercises and it just makes you feel good that she can stand and relate and relay information and respond to the situation as it is now. I just think that she&#8217;s a godsend. It was time for a change and I believe they&#8217;re doing their best to rise to the occasion, so we&#8217;re very proud to be living in this time.  JF: Well, is there anything that we haven&#8217;t talked about that you&#8217;d like to talk about, or is there anything that I didn&#8217;t ask that you&#8217;d like to bring up?  SCC: I don&#8217;t know how much more I can say. [Laughter] I think I&#8217;ve poured my life out. My dad had a street named for him in 1989, and that was the year that he was going to turn ninety years old, and from New Jersey I had planned a family reunion. We had not had a big reunion ever before and so from there I was planning a reunion on his birthday. He died twenty days before his birthday when he would have turned ninety, but we still had the reunion here and it became like a celebration of his life and so that was kind of special. When they named the street for him he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m unworthy. I&#8217;m unworthy.&#8221; I have the video&#8212;I&#8217;m sorry, the audio&#8212;that the Maryville Times did when they interviewed him after they named the street for him and that&#8217;s something that I like to listen to on occasion. We were able to get together and people came from all over the United States for this particular reunion. The next one I had was in &#8217;93, so I have tried to keep the family together as much as possible. One of the things that I did last year for the reunion was to have a genealogist help me to do our family tree and to do genealogy as much as I could. We actually went back to 1807, our grandmother that I never knew, and we were able to find this information and I have a lot of genealogy that we did just in a few months. Because they lived here in east Tennessee it was easy to do the research, and that is one legacy that I hope to pass on, that we now know more about from whence we came and that&#8217;s something that nobody had ever done before. Right now I&#8217;m collecting pictures and I&#8217;m calling people all across the United States. If you had a relative who did anything here in Blount County I want their picture, and I have received particularly one of a midwife that was in Alcoa that delivered a lot of the children. I didn&#8217;t have a picture of her and I got it about two weeks ago. So I&#8217;m doing that kind of thing and trying to get our family to honor the people who made us who we are, what we are. So that&#8217;s another one of my goals for the family thing.   One other thing I did not mention is that in 2003 I was the vice president of the genealogical historical society and I had my brother and Richard Williams to do a presentation with me at the public library on the contributions of African Americans to Blount County. Out of that meeting one of the citizens of Blount County came to my brother and me and talked about organizing a group that could do something about the history. So at that table in there we met and decided to call ourselves African Americans of Appalachia and Blount County, or AAABC. So we formed this committee and our goal was to do what I said earlier, to research, report and preserve our history. One of the things that we did was to do a calendar just to make people aware of us, and that particular one did end up in Washington, in the&#8212;what is it, in DC?  JF: The National Archives?  SCC: Not the archives but the&#8212;oh, I can&#8217;t think right now. But anyway, that&#8217;s one of the first things that I did in 2003, was to form this committee. While we are not meeting on a monthly basis we&#8217;re still doing things in the name of AAABC. I go to churches, schools, organizations, and present exhibits. My downstairs is like a museum.  JF: [Laughs]  SCC: I have all kinds of trifles and books with information about the schools, about our history, and that&#8217;s AAABC and that&#8217;s what we try to do, is preserve our history.  JF: That&#8217;s great. This, for the record, is a calendar from July, 2003 to June, 2004 and it&#8217;s &#8220;African Americans of Appalachia and Blount County: Lest we forget: Shaping our future from our past.&#8221; And there are some really neat images in here, photos of the first school house, photos of World War II and Korean War veterans, some really great stuff.   SCC: And that&#8217;s what I want to do, is just do a pictorial. Later on if I&#8217;m still around I will do a chronicle of life which will be more prose, more writing than pictures. So that&#8217;s my present focus, the pictorial, and then once that&#8217;s done do the chronicle, which would use the interviews. That&#8217;s the one thing. AAABC had students from Maryville College to go out and do oral interviews of people in Blount County. I need to know what to do with those interviews. They&#8217;re in a folder&#8212;.  JF: Yeah. You know we interviewed Susan Ambler last summer.  SCC: Oh, you did get to talk with her.  JF: My colleague, Jessica, did it and I believe Jessica said that Susan has given some of the interviews to the Southern Historical Collection, which means once they&#8217;re processed and digitized they&#8217;ll be available online, and in the meantime&#8212;  SCC: This is the second one.  JF: &#8212;there&#8217;s&#8212;. Even if you can&#8217;t get them online they are available and open to the public through the Southern Historical Collection. This I wanted to give you is a pamphlet from the SOHP.  SCC: Thank you.  JF: And there&#8217;s information about our website&#8212;  SCC: Oh, great.  JF: &#8212;and how to find our interviews, the online interview guides.  SCC: Super.  JF: So I think I'll have Jessica talk more with Susan Ambler about that.  SCC: Okay.   JF: Because I think she&#8217;s already been in contact with us.  SCC: Great.  JF: Oh, this is great.  SCC: Because I&#8217;m trying to find out what to do. They&#8217;re in a notebook, they&#8217;re in two notebooks, and I have not found where to go with them. Some of them are&#8212;.  JF: Lynn Swann! I&#8217;m from Pittsburgh, so. [Laughs]  SCC: Oh, you know&#8212;? Oh, he ran for governor. He was born here, didn&#8217;t live here much, but his parents lived here and they&#8217;re good friends of ours. In fact his mom was in school with my brother.  JF: Oh, wow. Yeah, Lynn Swann is&#8212;. The 1970s Steelers, people still talk about them. [Laughs]  SCC: He was here last year. They honored him at the theater uptown and they had a golf tournament that he was a part of.  JF: Well this is really special. Thank you for sharing this with me and thank you for doing this.  SCC: Well, to God be the glory.  JF: Yes.  SCC: Somebody has to do it.
