Evan Faulkenbury: Okay. Today is March 12, 2015. My name is Evan Faulkenbury. I am interviewing Donna Lyn Poe in Eli Whitney, North Carolina. So to begin with, thank you again for meeting with me.        Donna Poe: Absolutely.         EF: The first question I have is to tell me about your childhood.        DP: My childhood. I was born in Albany, New York. I don't remember that at all. And then we moved to Schenectady, Massachusetts when I was a toddler. I don't remember too much there either. But then I start remembering things when we moved to Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. So there I went to elementary school and somewhere along the way while we were living in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, my parents became divorced. So we lived there a year or two after their divorce and then we moved to Connecticut. I went to junior high school in Connecticut. A lot of people say, &#8220;Were you in the military or something?" because it seems, when I think about it, I moved all over the place. It was really a good childhood, though. So junior high in Connecticut, and then when I was fifteen we moved to Florida. That's where I called home. I lived in Florida for thirty years before moving to North Carolina. But as far as my younger childhood, I had a good childhood. Loving family, other than the divorce [door squeaks]. Is it recording okay?        EF: It is.        DP: Okay, okay, okay.        EF: I'll double-check it from time to time, but keep on talking.         DP: So I'm trying to think about my childhood.        EF: Sure.         DP: I had allergies growing up. So I had to go to the allergist every couple of weeks to have a shot for this cough that I would always have from dust. I was allergic to dust and that sort of thing. But fortunately I grew out of that because we have animals now. But like I said, my childhood that I really think about, that I attribute to is Florida. I went to high school in Florida. Growing up within my family, I'm sure we'll talk later about my faith, but I did not grow up as a churchgoer. I was not a Christian. I didn't even realize later on--well, I thought I was a Christian, but I didn't really understand the sense of the word until later on in my adult life. So we didn't go to church. We would go during holidays [scratching on the table can be heard]. We were a very blessed and loving family. My mother remarried so I consider my stepfather my father. They had another child, who is my sister, who I said lives in North Carolina now too. I consider her completely my full sister, even though she's my half-sister, fourteen years younger than me. I met my husband in tenth grade when I was in high school. His family actually had moved from Pennsylvania right around the same year that we moved from Connecticut at a different town. He lived about twenty minutes away and so we met at my first job. It was love at first sight. We were high school sweethearts and married a couple of years after high school and are still married. It's going to be thirty-four years, if I have the dates right.         EF: Congratulations.        DP: Thank you! I don't know if I'm speeding too far ahead with the childhood thing. If there's anything extra that you would want me to share, I'm trying to think.         EF: There are many things. But it's fine that you've sped ahead a little bit, that covers quite a bit of ground, but I definitely want to rewind and ask you some more things in more detail. I wonder if you could talk a little more about your family members. Can you tell me about the background of your mother and then your father separately? And then your stepfather, I guess, as well too, since you said that you were so close.         DP: Yeah. Yeah. So my father, my real father, I don't really have much contact with him ever since the divorce. It wasn't really a good situation. He was in sales. Pharmaceutical sales was his job. He recently retired from that. He was an avid golfer. I remember that. When we were growing up, she was mostly a stay at home mom, she would work part time. After the divorce she did have to work full-time. She had to work two or three jobs. I remember always thinking, I didn't know how we were able to make ends meet. She was amazing. I used to think at Christmas, I believed in Santa for the longest time, I remember now. I believed in Santa for the longest time because it was like there is no way my mother could have gotten all of that. So there has to be a Santa. So my mom was very interested in plantings. When we moved to Florida she had a greenhouse built and that evolved into a plant-type nursery business where she sold wholesale to different locations. Primarily, the biggest thing that she did was that she would install plants in different hospitals in the area and do the maintenance on those. So I remember going along with her and helping her and pinching off the yellow leaves and watering. I think that's maybe where my plant interest got started, even though I still say before we started this garden I really didn't know anything about plants, because I really didn't. But I liked the maintenance of them and would help her with that. My stepfather, I'm trying to think where they met. She had worked at a club and he was working there at the club.        EF: In Florida?        DP: In Florida. Mhmm. So in Florida, he got a job at UPS. So he worked pretty much at UPS and at the post office and then retired from that. He's an amazing man.        EF: Do you know much about--well I'm sorry, you were still talking about your stepfather.        DP: No, yeah. That's good. Yeah, yeah.        EF: Okay. I apologize. Well I wanted to know, how much do you know about your mother's family? About her background or her parents?         DP: My grandparents were in Florida with us. They actually had moved to Florida three or four years before we moved to Florida from Connecticut. I'm trying to think of what my grandmother did. I always knew her as grandma being retired. My grandfather, I believe was in sales, but from what I can remember from him, he was retired as well. My grandmother had died before my grandfather, and my grandfather had actually moved in with my mom and dad. I was still living there, I think at the time--no I wasn't, I had already moved out. So he had lived there for a number of years. Both just very loving people. On my father's side, I knew my grandmother, his mother, but that was about it. I wasn't really close with the rest of the family until she died. Again, it was kind of hard. It was strange because of the divorce and that sort of thing.        EF: Sure. Of course. Well can you tell me a little bit more about moving around so much? It seemed like all around New England.        DP: I know! Sometimes I think about did that ever have an affect on me? I really don't think it did. Like I said, I consider Florida home and definitely established roots there. If you ask my husband, he would move back in a heartbeat, but my heart is in North Carolina now. There's no way I'd ever move. Plus, my niece and nephew live in Pittsboro. There's no way. So they're five and seven. The moving around, no, I didn't feel like a military kid or anything like that.         EF: Why did your family move so much? Was it because of work?         DP: I know when we moved to Florida from Connecticut, my stepfather had been laid off, so it was an opportune time to make a big change. I can't remember where he was working at the time that he was laid off. It was just kind of the thing, a lot of people were moving to Florida. It was a place that you could buy a house for a third of what you would buy in New England. So they sold their house up there in Connecticut for a good amount of money and were able to pay off some bills, I think, was the scenario, and we got a really nice house in Florida. We got to have a pool. I got to have my own room. So that was the sell job to me. I'm like, "Okay!"         EF: Can you tell me a little bit more about whatever you remember about your education? I guess elementary school, you would have maybe bounced around Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and you said Connecticut is where you went to junior high, or part of it at least. Anything stand out, or--.        DP: Well I know I started kindergarten when I was in Hampton Beach, so elementary school was in Hampton. And I remember, vaguely, kindergarten. It was a half a day and I remember I was really nervous about it. Like I said, it's hard for me to remember. Junior high was in Connecticut and that's when I started becoming interested in art. I always loved to draw and everyone always said I was such a good color-er. In junior high I took an art class and I started becoming more interested in art at that point, and continued in high school and took some more classes and really thought that might be something I was going to continue with. But then I got involved in high school with Future Business Leaders of America through one of my business classes. I took a typing class and got interested in that. I think that's where I got involved and developed leadership skills with that. And I became not only the chapter president, but the district president and would head meetings. I was still as anything to speak in front of people, in front of large groups, but that definitely was what started my interest in that. The art got waylaid and I never really did much with my art. But my sons on the other hand both are amazing artists. The oldest son went to school for art, but then his major changed in the process, but the younger one did continue and ended with a bachelor in fine arts. So the art's definitely in the family.        EF: Wow. That's great.         DP: So I feel like working with my hands, but it's in the dirt.         EF: There's artistry to that, of course.         DP: Yeah. So in high school I considered myself a B student. I always made the honor roll, not straight A&#8217;s but B&#8217;s, but I worked hard at it. It didn't seem to come easy for me. I studied hard. I worked hard. I vaguely thought about going to college, but my family definitely was not in the position to help me with it, and back then, way back then, it was more like a fifty percent ratio of kids that went onto college. So I didn't feel too much of a pressure. Plus I was with my high school sweet heart and I didn't want to leave. We had these visions of getting married. He didn't have plans to go to college. I remember I went and took my PSAT and I was so scared, so scared. That was the final thing that scared me away. I was like, "There's no way I can go to college." So that's why later on in the story, since I did end up going and getting a two-year degree in sustainable ag [agriculture].         EF: Great. We'll certainly come to that.         DP: Yeah, yeah. We will get to that point. Right.         EF: Sticking around your childhood, you did mention before that your family didn't grow up in church. So I'm wondering if you could expand on that and tell me about what religious beliefs or non-religious beliefs you grew up with?        DP: Well, I guess we were Protestant. That's how my mom would refer to it as. We were Protestants. At the time as a child, I didn't really think much of it. I didn't feel like I was an outsider because I wasn't going to church. She would often have us go to vacation bible school over the summers as an activity to go and I enjoyed it. But it wasn't ever anything that--it was the crafts part that I enjoyed [laughs]. I never had this yearning as a child. Even in high school I really can't say that I had this sensation that I was missing something in my life. I actually had a best friend that, now I know was a true Christian, and she belonged to a youth group. So I went so some of the youth group events. And so I feel, looking back you see as a Christian later, God was always there, obviously, and he was calling me and I didn't realize it. I have complete faith that his ultimate calling and leading of me at the point in my life when I did become a Christian was his perfect timing, but I could see his presence in my previous life. And so I went to several out of town gatherings with that youth group and I remember starting to feel something, something moving inside me. But still wasn't ready to make any kind of, or didn't really understand again what the whole born again concept was and what that truly meant. I remember when my grandmother died, for some reason, again this is fuzzy, but I remember the family almost worrying about me a little bit because of my friendship with this friend, and I found myself picking up a Bible and reading it and really finding comfort in reading that Bible. I don't think I was going to church at that point, I was more involved with that youth group, but it was a phase and then the Bible got put aside. I didn't really pick it up. It wasn't until many years later when I became a Christian. But again, another sense of God being there without me even realizing it or even asking for it. I actually forgot about that until we were talking about this. It's hard, because I think now if my mom is to listen to this interview, she's so firmly set in her beliefs that we all were always Christians. And she's even said to me, "Honey, you've always been a Christian." I've tried to have discussions with her to try and explain to her where I am now and what it really means, and I keep praying that she will come to understand what it's all about. I truly believe they did everything the best that they could do, and they were wonderful parents with my upbringing. Even though I don't feel like I was raised as a true Christian as I would have hoped that I could have even raised my children as, which I wasn't and I didn't. Again, I know that God's timing is perfect.         EF: Well thanks for sharing all that.        DP: Yeah.        EF: Can you tell me a little more about the youth group? You mention the word youth group and I'm wondering if you could describe what it was?        DP: I'm trying to remember. I'm actually thinking it was a Methodist church, which is crazy, and I never even thought about it. I'm remembering back now. I believe it was a Methodist church and it was something where--. I can't remember if they had weekly meetings. I don't even think I went weekly. It was maybe a situation, whenever I was at--because she was my best friend, so I spent a lot of time with her--and so if she was going to it, I would go along with her. I remember there were several two or three day events where I would go and I remember there was a lot of sitting around, singing to maybe the pastor, I'm not sure, whoever was leading it singing while he was playing the guitar. I can't remember all that happened but I remember it was very special. I remember feeling a very special feeling.         EF: Just to double check, this was in Florida when you were in high school?        DP: Yes. So I would have been maybe ninth, tenth grade.         EF: Can you tell me exactly where in Florida?         DP: Springhill, Florida. It was forty miles north of Tampa.         EF: Okay. Great.         DP: It was ninth [grade], maybe the beginning of tenth because it was before I met my husband. It was probably shortly before I met him. Because I met him the later part of tenth, maybe it was the eleventh grade when I met him.         EF: Okay. Great. One more general question about childhood, if you don't mind. I'm wondering, you've talked a lot about how special your family was to you. Who else was influential in your life growing up, whether it was family in particular, were there others? I'm trying to get a sense of who was a big influence on you when you grew up.        DP: Well, I know the advisor for Future Business Leaders of America, Ron Belcher, was really amazing. I felt like he found me in the typing class one day. I can't even remember how it all evolved, but it was something that interested me, the group. And he saw something in me, I guess. I don't think I would have ever thought to run for all of these positions and do all of this if it wasn't for his encouragement. So definitely him. My grandmother I feel like was a huge influence. And again, I always think about if there was any Christian woman that was to influence me in my childhood, even though she wasn't a confessed Christian, I always think of my grandmother. I know on All Saints Day when we light a candle I always think of my grandmother. Often times growing up, mother-daughter relationships, my mom and I would get into something, and it would only take a couple of words from her and it would snap me into reality. Now looking back I think, "That was God. That was God speaking through her."         EF: Well, thank you for sharing again. Well, shifting gears a little bit I suppose, I'll ask this question, and then we might have to rewind again if need be again in the future, but you've talked about your religious background. You said you got exposed to it in youth group in high school, but then you put it down for a while until much later. Could you go ahead and tell that story about your religious history in a way and how you came back around?        DP: Sure. So I feel like there were some more feedings of it before I actually became a Christian. I would say when my husband and I were to get married, we went through some pre-[marriage counseling]--because we wanted to get married in a church because that's what you do, we figured that's what we would want to do--so it happened to be a Lutheran church. I don't even remember, I think a friend had gotten married there or something, so we decided on going to this one particular church. There were some pre-marriage sessions, obviously. I remember going through that process. I think that maybe some of that had planted some seeds for that process. But we didn't keep going to that church or anything after we got married. So then raising my kids, one of my best friends while I was raising the kids had become a Christian, so I remember her talking to me every now and then about it, and she was actually my best friend in high school, so this was later on. I remember feeling almost standoff-ish. We even were not friends for a long time because of that. I felt like she was kind of pushing it on me. It was very difficult. But then again, I can't but help but to think that those were some seeds being planted.         So then when my kids were maybe ten and thirteen, somewhere around there, a friend of my husband's had invited us to a Christmas service at his church, so we went. Somewhere in the middle of the service they stopped midway and there was a mini-worship service type thing. We were okay with that. We were listening and all, but then it was--actually, I just shared this the other night in one of our worship meetings--last night it was--it was really weird because right in the middle of the worship service, it was like what we would equate our time of "passing the peace,&#8221; they did something where they said, "Do you know where you're going? Do you know where you're going?" And they would turn to the person to each side of them. It seemed like this swarm of people came to us and said, "Do you know where you're going?" I get chills when I think about it. It was really freaky. My one son's like, "Mom, what's going on? What are they saying? What are they asking us?" They were really freaked out by it. It really put a bad taste in our minds, that whole process. It was hard because it was a friend of my husband's. So that really put a major halt, I feel like, at that point. And again, I have to only hope and pray and know that God was there throughout all that and there was reason for all of that. Maybe for me to share the story, or whatever. I think that we had tried to go to a church a couple of times before that, but that was definitely like, no way. There's no way. I didn't want to put our kids through that. I didn&#8217;t understand what was going on with that.         So it wasn't until many years later. We had moved here, to North Carolina, and it was actually the first--no it was three years later--after we had moved to North Carolina. My husband and I had gone through a really difficult time in our marriage. I call in now a &#8220;season of storms&#8221; [chuckles]. So my sister had a friend that worked with that I had become good friends with as well, and she was a Christian. I guess I had come to know at some point that there was a difference between a Christian and a non-Christian, or someone who's thinking they are Christian or the way I grew up. So in the process of my experience with my husband and we had temporarily split up, I found myself needing something greater than what I was dealing with. I went to her, her name was Sally, and so as far as influential people go in my later life, Sally would be it. Sally Sullivan. I went to her and I said, "I need to know about God. I need you to tell me. I know that I need him." It was amazing. She just sat. I spent the night there and we prayed all night and she got out the Bible--I get chills when I think about it. I could tell that she was nervous about what to share and how to do this. She had been a Christian for maybe four or five years at that point. I'm not sure. But she even herself, she got out her computer and she was googling what to share to make sure. So then she got the Bible, like I said, and reading some scriptures and pointing me right to a couple of scriptures to read and invited me afterwards to go into her extra bedroom and to pray to God and to ask for my salvation and to read these scriptures. And I did. It was amazing! Did I see fireworks? Was it this Damascus moment? No, but I definitely was changed that evening. Things started happening really fast after that.         EF: Wow.        DP: [Laughs]. And it gets even better.         EF: Well, if you want to continue on that train of thought, we'll go back and cover more biographical details, but what--.        DP: I hope I'm not rambling too much.         EF: You're not. No. Please, rambling is fine.        DP: Feel free to edit however you need to edit or whatever [laughs].        EF: Well what happened next?        DP: So what happened next? I'm trying to think. So I spent the night that night, and I remember this overwhelming feeling of--right away I started learning about forgiveness in several different areas of my life. Both, obviously my husband, which was the immediate, and then my father, which came pretty shortly after all of that. But with my husband I knew that despite all that had happened, we needed to work this out. We needed to work this out. And the only way that we could do it is if we were together. I really felt that I needed to go back home and that we needed to somehow make this happen and get through this hurt and figure it out. He wasn't willing at that point, he just wasn't. And he wasn't where I was, at all, obviously. I had seen, I think it was just within this period of time too, I had seen an ad in the paper about a movie that was going to be playing and it was called Fireproof Your Marriage. I don't know if you're familiar with the movie. I don't know why, but I felt like we had to go see this movie. We just had to go see this movie together. So I went home and told him that I was coming home, and that I really wanted to work things out, and I wanted to go see this movie tonight [chuckles]. It was like, "Okay." So he's like, "Alright, we'll go see this movie together." So the movie is about this couple that is going through tough times and it was a Christian-based movie and all this, with Kirk Cameron and I can't remember who the producer was. We went and as we were leaving the movie theater, I went to get up and I was crying [makes false sobbing noise], and so we went to stand up and he pulled me down. I'm like, "What? We've got to get going." And he said, "This just might be the most important day in our life." I'm like, "What?" And he's like, "Yeah, something's happening here." And I knew he was feeling it too. I was like, &#8220;Oh my goodness,&#8221; and I said, "Well, should we try to find a church or something?" It felt like we had to go somewhere and pray. So we got into the car because it was an afternoon movie. We got into the car and we tried to find the church of the guy that wrote this article because it was a local pastor that had written the article, some pastor in Burlington. So we tried to find the church and of course by the time we got there, I can't remember what day it was, but the church was closed. So I got the information, and I'm like, "Alright, I'll call him and we'll try and get with him." I was so excited. We get back in the car and on the way home we didn't really talk at all, but it was almost like in that instant, in the twenty minute drive home, I was on fire and his light went out. So we get home and I say, "Well, I'll go ahead and try and get in touch with that pastor and we'll see if we can--." And he's like, "Alright, well, maybe we won't rush into anything." He was really evasive and it was so weird. From that point on--I'm trying to remember all the details because it's all good right now so it is hard to remember the bad, but later on--it was within a couple of weeks, I knew that I had to start going to a church. My fire, I was passionate, my fire was going and we were still kind of stumbling in our relationship. We went to a marriage counselor and we were trying to work through it an all, but it was still not good and he still was not fully in the marriage, but we were still together, at least. We were in the same house. I found myself led to this church. People asked, "Well, why did you pick this church?" I used to pass this church all the time going to my sister's house because she had lived in Chapel Hill at the time, and I was a nanny for her kids. I was watching them. That was the reason why I moved here because I knew that she was going to have kids, and so I decided to be the nanny for them because she needed help. And so I always passed this church, and so I thought, "Well, this always seemed like a friendly church, so why not?" My husband actually came here for the first time, together, and that's all it took. So we continue coming to the church together for about maybe a year or so, and then he stopped coming. Like I said, we were still having problems. It wasn't until very recently that we've really come to a really great marriage. Yeah [chuckles]. I'm trying to figure out--I know I missed a lot in all of that.         EF: No, that is--.        DP: Of course the garden is a whole story in itself.         EF: Yeah, I'll come to that. Well thanks for sharing such personal details.         DP: Mhmm. Yeah.         EF: Well, can you tell me a little bit more about this church? It's Concord United Methodist Church, right? In Eli Whitney, North Carolina.         DP: Mhmm.         EF: So can you tell me a little bit more about what it was that drew you here? Well, you told me what drew you here, but what made you stay?        DP: Yeah. Yeah. What's really funny is because I happened to pop in one day, I think it was in August--no it was in November--it was in November and the person that was preaching I later found out was just a church member. One of the elders of the church. There were only maybe like ten people here that day, but thinking back, I didn't even realize that. I was just excited to be here in this church listening to this person preaching and how friendly the people were after the service. I remember this older woman, an existing church member now, Hazel Ellington, and she was so excited that we were here. She's eighty-six. She's like, "Are you going to come back? Are you going to come back?" And they had talked about a fellowship luncheon the following week after church and I was like, "Sure!" I said, "Are we invited to that lunch?" She's like "Yes! And don't bring anything, just come." It was just, wow, this is great. I've never experienced what a church family is like. It was wonderful. So then I later found out the next week that the guy that was preaching, like I said, was just an elder, and that the reason there were only ten people in the church was because there was a half-marathon in the Outer Banks and so the church had formed a group of maybe thirty or so that had gone to that, including the pastor. So it's always been the joke that the guy that was preaching, John Galloway, and I said, "I even came back and John was the preacher that day." I don't think he has ever preached since then, actually. The following year, I was a part of that group. I did my first half-marathon, so it was neat.        EF: Great. Well what are some of the theological beliefs here that you felt comfortable with that drew you in?        DP: I think the traditional beliefs because--. It's funny because looking back now, I'm so thankful because I never realized within my faith that I am very conservative and not progressive in thinking. In fact, as I've grown in my faith and I'm seeing the many types of beliefs that are out there, I'm like "Yeah, I'm definitely a Methodist." It's very traditional and that's where I feel comfortable. I completely believe in God's word and I rely on that, and I get really scared when there are different views out there and people try to twist things. Personally, right now in my journey, I'm asking God to open my mind to other thinkings if that's what he wants of me. And understanding that he might not want that of me right now but maybe later on he will, and that's what I'm trying to come to terms with in my own walk. But yeah, it's very traditional. Actually, within the Methodist church I've since come to understand that there is a very progressive side of the Methodist church and a very traditional side. In fact, there's talk of the church even splitting, which scares me, so we'll have to see how that all plays out. But this church, it's a very--. Most of the people here are born and raised. Their children go here. They've lived here all of their lives and their parents lived here. So it's mostly an older group. We're trying to encourage young folks--the garden--to get young folks into the church. And we have been very blessed in what seems like just in the last year, some new families have come and been a part of the church. So that's great because a lot of the older members are dying, and it's gotten to be a thing all around with churches in general, I've been hearing.         EF: Okay. Excellent. Well, I want to know more about the church and of course the garden, but before that, I'm also curious about your life in Florida. I know that this is a big change of topic from what you were talking about. I didn't want to stop you when you were in the flow of your religious stories, so thank you for that. But if you could talk about your life after high school in Florida. You said you lived in Florida for a good many years. Several decades, I think. What did you do? What was life like?        DP: Yeah. Yeah. So while I was in high school, I would say I was a good student and I was a fairly good kid. I mean, I did some drinking, I did some partying, but my parents were fully trusting of me and I didn't get into that much trouble. So again, I attribute that to my good upbringing. Halfway through my senior year I started working at a local bank. I feel like that was through my Future Business Leaders of America affiliation because they were looking for some folks to work in the bank. So I took on a job there as a receptionist, and when I graduated I continued on and ended up after having my second son leaving the bank as bank manager. So I worked through the ranks. I never was a bank teller, but I did everything else. I worked through the birth of my first son at the bank, and then with the second son we planned ahead that I wanted to be a stay at home mom. So we made out a management plan and paid all our bills off so that I could be at home. So I did that and after, I would say after three months of being a stay at home mom I started getting itchy and doing some crafty things around the house, and started hanging things up and started sharing things with friends and they would say, "You should start selling this stuff." So within maybe six months I started selling it and doing some local craft fairs, and that turned into a twenty year business of doing art shows and traveling all over the southeast and going forty weekends a year.        EF: Oh wow.        DP: Dragging the kids along. "Not another craft show!" But you know what, I was a stay at home mom. I was up until three o&#8217;clock in the morning getting ready for those shows and stressed out, but I was able to always make every field trip, every school function, and do what I wanted to do, what I felt like I was supposed to be doing, but still being able to help financially.         EF: That's impressive. What crafts were your specialties?        DP: It was dried floral crafts.        EF: Okay. Wow. Beautiful.        DP: So I did shadow boxes and wreaths and swags and anything having to do with dried flowers.         EF: Wow! So you learned gardening from your mom at an early age outside of the hospital with the flowers.        DP: Yeah.        EF: And then you turned it into a decades long business. And then it's now apart of your story now.        DP: Began working with my hands.        EF: Right. Right. That's fascinating. I love the symmetry of it all. Personally, I guess you said you married your high school sweetheart and had two kids. When were your two sons, is that what I heard?         DP: Mhmm.        EF: Okay. When were they born?         DP: So John was born in 1986. So he's twenty-eight. And Justin was born in 1989. Both May babies. Just wonderful kids.         EF: Terrific.        DP: Perfect, perfect kids. Never had any problems with them. Did you want me to talk a little more about them at this point? I love bringing up my kids.         EF: If you'd like to. Please.         DP: I'm trying to think. Both were involved with sports. So we did the sports thing. My husband was very sports-minded in school. He was captain of his soccer team and did baseball and football and all of that. So raising two boys, he was coach of all of their teams. Even all of their friends to this day refer to him as Coach. We actually went back recently to a friends wedding in Florida, her daughter's wedding, so all of the kids there were like, "Coach." A couple of them even pulled him aside and said what an influence he was in their life, and it was so touching. So we were, like I said, all about sports. Doing all of the games. Of course they were always at different times and at different fields and the juggling of all that, but we got through that. So then they both did really good in school, and I was always trying to encourage them to do better so that they would get scholarships because we weren't in a situation to provide them with school because by the time they got in, it was definitely at that point where, "Yes, you do go to college." So I really wanted them to go. And they had all intentions of going, but weren't thinking ahead about how they were going to pay for that. But fortunately they both were able to, because of the way my husband and my income was, they were able to get a lot of grants and student loans and both did amazing in college. College was like a sponge to them. It pulled out these attributes. My oldest son went to school for art because throughout his high school, he was doing mural artwork with his then future wife and took all of the art classes in school and excelled in that. But then when he got to school he had to take a foreign language as an elective, so he took German because he always thought that might be cool. He took Spanish in high school and he didn't do well in Spanish, so he's like "I'll try German." Well he ended up majoring in German and then also got interested in Physics, and he majored in Physics and Computer Science. He graduated with three majors. I'm like, "Can't you pick one?" So then he went on to grad school at A&amp;T in Greensboro. They both went to school in Greensboro at Guilford College. So he went on for--I'm trying to remember what his actual graduate degree was--but he's working at MIT in Boston now. For Lincoln Labs. And then the younger son ended up staying in art. He was more on the sculpture end of it. So he went for sculpture. He actually went in for theater design and then he went back for a second degree in sculpture and graduated with a bachelor in fine arts.         EF: Wow. That's impressive.        DP: Yeah. Yeah. Very proud of my boys. Obviously, I could go on and on talking about them.         EF: Well, that's excellent. Let me make sure I got the trajectory right. You do your own business for many decades and then you decide to move here because your sister was here, right?        DP: Mhmm.        EF: And you wanted to watch her kids. That's what brought you up here. That must have only been, how many years ago?        DP: So that was seven years ago.        EF: Okay.         DP: We'd actually been talking about--well, my husband was talking about it more than I was--because she had been up here for maybe--. Oh, I can't remember. I remember when she first moved up here it was only going to be for two years. It was a two-year internship type thing and then she was going to come back to Florida, but then she met her future husband and that was that. So for a couple of years there we had been talking about it, my husband more than me. He was like, "Don't you want to move up there with your sister?" I'm like, "No," because I'm very set in my ways, "No, we'll never sell this house." Plus we lived right next door to my parents. After we graduated and got married we moved maybe about twenty minutes from where I went to high school and bought ten acres with my parents. So we lived on five and they lived on five. So that was great raising the boys with Granny and Peeps right next-door. So there was no way I could move away from my parents. I mean what would they say? What would they do? I mean we couldn't do that. He really thought it would be great because his family lived in Pennsylvania so we would be halfway, be able to see them more. But I was pretty set in stone. There's no way. And I didn't think we would be able to sell the house. So then, it was one time he asked me again for the last time, and I was like--.  It was right around when I realized my sister wasn't coming back and I knew she had gotten married. I was so close to her, she was my best friend, even though we were fourteen years apart, that I wanted to be there when she started having kids was my real thing. So we went on and put the house up for sale. It was right at the time when houses were going crazy. It was before the bubble burst. So we sold our house for probably three times what we could have. Someone said, "Just put any price. Just some crazy price and then go with that." And that's what we did. We sold it within six months. So we were able to pay off all of our bills and move up here and get started and have a good chunk to get going with. So it was maybe a couple of days after we moved here that my sister announced that she was pregnant. So it was awesome.        EF: Excellent timing. And then, you've already told me the other side of the story about your religious upbringing and learning more about God and then what happened when you were here. So that brings us up to pretty close to where we're at now. So I finally want to ask you about the garden. I guess I'll leave it at that. Tell me about it.        DP: Yeah. So the garden came right at that window, which I feel like I'm probably still in that window of my passion, but I was really all excited and all on fire that first couple of months of becoming a Christian. So it was November when I first came here and so it was somewhere around February, I guess it was, I had just officially joined the church. I went through that process. There was talk about a workshop that was happening at a nearby church, Cedar Grove United Methodist Church. The garden was Antioch Community Garden. I only heard vague information about it but I knew the pastor of the church at the time, David King, was going to go to that workshop and find out about starting a community garden. Somewhere in the process I heard that he wasn't going to be able to go because one of our church members, one of the older church members had died, and he had to do that funeral. It was going to be on the day of the workshop. I can't remember how it came about, but I remember thinking, "That's a shame that he's not going to go." I was like, "I wonder if maybe I could go." Later on, I'm like--now I know, but at the time I was like, where did that come from? And I was actually scheduled to go that weekend to go with my younger sister to see my other sister in Virginia for a mini weekend trip. I remember thinking maybe I'll cancel that and go to this meeting. Maybe I should go take notes at that meeting. But then I didn't want to disappoint my family because I had already made plans to go. Well then, something happened. I can't remember what it was but the trip was canceled. I was like, "Oh! Okay. Maybe I'll go to that meeting then." So I asked the pastor is it only for pastors. "This meeting, do you think maybe I could go and take notes?" He's like, "Yeah. Would you want to?" I'm like, "Sure. I don't mind taking notes." He's like, "Alright, well let me quickly go ahead and send an email back and cancel my cancel,&#8221; because he had already canceled his registration and so he did. I went. I later found out later that actually there were several church members for two or three years that had been talking about a community garden and it never evolved.         So I went to this meeting and it was an all day thing. I was blown away, obviously. I couldn't take enough notes and I knew instantly that I better take good notes because we were going to do this. I just knew, we have to do this. I really felt the presence of the holy spirit, and again, I was still in my new Christian faith and didn't really understand how it all worked, but I knew clearly that I was feeling something huge inside me. And I remember there was part of the whole workshop was a worship service outside at the garden by one of the Duke Divinity interns, which we since have been blessed with Duke Divinity interns here at the garden. But it was a young girl named Laura Beech and she was a grad student through the seminary. I was so taken with the passion in her and her sharing her faith and equating it to gardens. I get chills when I think about it again. I was like, &#8220;I want that. I want that.&#8221; I was even thinking maybe someday I'll go to divinity school. I was crazy, like, &#8220;This is so exciting. I want that passion.&#8221;         So I came back with all my notes and I told the pastor, "I'll type these notes up as quick as I can and this is what you do and see what you want to do with it." And he's like, "Well, what are you going to do about it?" I'm like, "What?" [laughs]. Again, I didn't know anything about gardening, but I found that part of the workshop was some details about gardening, like how they did the transplants and how to do these raised beds. It was a full day workshop and all of it was so exciting to me. I didn't even eat organic. So he was like, "Well, what are you going to do about it?" I'm like, "Oh my goodness. I'm not a leader. I don't know how to do any of this stuff. I just took notes. " He was like, "I'll help you." I'm like, "Alright." So I went back and started reading through my notes and it talked about forming a planning committee and getting as many people involved in the planning process, because you want them to have voice in the planning. So that's what I did. I followed the map of what to do. So I posted flyers around town and put an ad in the paper and said we were going to plan and meet to start a community garden. I don't think we really had anybody from the community. It was mostly from the church. The church was so supportive. Thinking back now, I think it was because they were so loving of me and they wanted to help me with this ministry because there really isn't anybody, a small percentage--. There are some people in the church who are garden angels who I'll tell you about later, but not really anybody from the church, other than the pastor who actually works in the garden. Because again, they're all older and a lot of them have gardens of their own, too. So it was really about supporting me and getting this thing off the ground, which we did. We did. We got it off the ground. The workshop was March 21, 2009 and then we officially dedicated the garden and did our first tomato plantings May 30, 2009. So it happened fast.         EF: Wow. Yeah.        DP: And it was amazing how things fell into place. We got donations of straw and compost and planting seeds, [and] some cash donations because we had nothing to start with. The church didn't provide any funds to start it. They provided the land, but that was pretty much it and still is. It just happened. God made it happen.         EF: And what success has the garden had?        DP: So shortly after the initial planting, unbeknownst to me, the church pastor's wife had written a grant and got it in the mail last minute. She didn't even make a copy of it, just quickly. She heard about it through the church district website. It was a grant through the Methodist conference having to do with environmental community action whatever, so she wrote this grant, and so we found out maybe a couple of months later, I didn't even know she had applied for it until we got it, and it was $4,000. And I'm like, "[makes gasping noise]." We were hand watering, we had the hose hooked up to the parsonage and were hand watering our plantings and stuff. We found out about--I didn't even know there was an old well in the back of the fellowship hall, so we were able to pay to get that fixed. So that's dedicated for the garden and we were able to get drip irrigation. We were very conservative because it was a grant to the church, so we had to account for everything, but it sustained us for a couple of years. We were able to have garden members. We initially had them pay five dollars a year to be a member, because that's what a lot of the other gardens were doing, so we followed in other gardens' footsteps. And because we had that money to spend, we were okay. So that worked out great. I always tell people that we started out small. We didn't start out small. I always have a tendency to do things big, but we started out with sixteen beds, but now in retrospect, that's small because now we have sixty plus beds. But we started our beds with what we call the "double dig system" and after that we learned how to do "lasagna layers." That's how we did the rest of our beds, and we are always trying to teach everybody all of the different ways. Everything we do in the garden we try and pass it forward and share with people. And there have been many garden members who have either started their own gardens or have gone on to start other gardens within their churches because like I said, there aren't many people from within our church. It's more the community and other churches that are involved. So it is pretty amazing.        EF: Wow. So what has the garden meant to you?        DP: The garden has meant to me, I mean, obviously I have grown there, both physically and spiritually. It's been a place of feeding my faith, assuring me how good God is. Assuring me that he truly will always provide even though every year, even up until this morning, I worry continuously about the funding of it or, &#8220;Are the seeds going to grow this year? Is this going to be the year that we're going to have failures?" Just trying to have faith that even within failures, the blessings are there. But it's definitely been something that I can honestly say, without being prideful, that has been fruitful to so many people's lives because there is not a night that someone says to me, in some shape or form, it's all different faiths and non-faiths of people saying how special the garden is to them, and how thankful they are for the garden and how thankful they are for me. And I always give it to God when they do that, but there have been many times when people say how they found healing in the garden where they never realized when they came to the garden they were at a point in their life where they were hurting, and they never thought they would find healing in a garden, and how thankful they are for that. And they don't know where that's coming from. The kids, the kids are amazing. They'll pull up a carrot and start eating it and the moms are like, "I'm not even going to care about the dirt because they're eating a vegetable. I just can't believe they're eating a vegetable." We had this one junior teen that maybe was drug to the garden maybe to get them away from the computer or whatever for an afternoon and he was like, "Man, this place is way cooler than I thought it was going to be!" So it's great to hear comments like that. And that feeds me. There are many times after everyone's left, a lot of our long-term garden members, they know that I spend a lot of time out there by myself, I always tell them, "Don't let that bother you." They'll try and hang around and make sure that I leave when they leave because they don't want me to stay there and finish up stuff, but what they don't realize that's like my time too, though. I really feel God's presence when I'm out there by myself, and I try and get out there early to try and get things set up. A lot of that is the control side of me too. But definitely, I feel God's presence when I'm out there by myself.         EF: Wow. Well, that brings me to the end of my questions. Before we turn it off, is there anything else that you would like to say or share?        DP: I'm trying to look here at my notes. I don't think so. I think that we've covered--there's always more that I could talk about the garden, of course, but it's definitely where I feel that God has planted me to be. I know that in the process, I know we talked about my going to school. What's really sustainable about the garden and me sharing with people, some people say, "I don't know anything about gardening." When I ask people, "Do you want to join our garden? You want to come out?" "Oh I don't know anything about gardening." I'm like, "You don't have to know. I knew nothing. We grow together. We learn together." I say, "I'm always googling and looking up stuff or picking the brain of the county extension office and sending them pictures and asking advice." So in the process of it, three years ago, I decided there's something about this. I might want to make a career of this. I was still a nanny for my niece and nephew and I was getting an itch, where I felt like [maybe] I was supposed to be doing something different or move on and do something, because obviously this was all volunteer and is still volunteer and a lot of hours, but I felt that maybe I'm supposed to do something job-wise. A real job type of thing. So I went to school for sustainable agriculture.         EF: Oh my. Yeah, you mentioned that earlier.        DP: So that was a juggle. With doing school fulltime. Of course I was going to do it fulltime. If I was going to do it, let's get this done and still do the garden. So I got through that and felt like the more I was learning, the more I realized I didn't know anything. I couldn't believe it and still feel like that at times the more I learn. So then after I graduated, I went to work fulltime last year at a farm and again learned probably five times what I learned in school. I didn't have my teachers, but the whole hands on actual working. It was hard work. Somewhere in the process of going to school and working at the farm I realized I did not want to be a farmer, that that was not going to be my career choice. Still not sure what that career choice is going to be, but I definitely, my passion was the community garden. I wanted to be more with my community garden and do more with it. I felt like I was being pulled in so many directions. Especially last year between family, church, garden, and work and wasn't giving what I felt like I should to all those different areas. So this year I'm taking the year off and trying to figure that all out. I'm praying for God to help me figure that out and trying not to get too caught into working even more, harder, in the community garden and being stuck there. I shouldn't even really use that word, stuck. But my thing is, I really want to see the garden become sustainable in leadership so that I feel that God--I really feel strongly that God is going to move me somewhere, and I'm trying not to get ahead of his timing, but I feel that my job is to prepare this garden for that step. And I can't think that if I was to leave the garden would fail, I have to have faith that God has already got it figured out and I know he's already gone before me, but I feel like I'm supposed to be a part of the process in helping that leadership transition. We have a lot of people that are content with putting in their hour and they don't want to be leaders, they're scared of being leaders, probably because they're looking at all that I do and they're probably thinking, "I can't do that." So that's why I'm trying. We've been having some meetings to try and work that out and I feel like it will happen. I really do. So trying to split up all that I'm doing in my day as far as organizing and running the garden.         EF: Right. Wow. Well that is a lot to juggle. I'm glad that you mentioned about going back to school and working on a farm. Are you still working there now?        DP: No. Like I said, I'm taking this year off.        EF: Oh yeah. That&#8217;s right.        DP: Because there is just no way. The whole time I was working my mind was on overtime thinking about all of the things I had to do. In fact, on my breaks I'd be writing notes that after work I'd be coming here and working three or four hours, and then twice a week we'd have the work nights, and then every Saturday I was here with the work nights and having to face all these people, which is wonderful, but it was a lot. It was a lot. Because we have some nights when we have twenty-five, thirty people out there all wanting to do--"What am I supposed to do? What are my jobs?" We're an all inclusive garden, so I make up a list and everyone works together, but I'm the one that plans it all out and I have to show everyone what to do. Again, we need to divide up leadership so that I'm not it all the time.        EF: Point well taken. Well thank you again for sitting with me and sharing your story.        DP: Absolutely. I hope it all makes sense.         EF: If does, absolutely.        DP: Okay.        EF: Okay well I'll go ahead and turn off the recorders.         DP: Okay great. Yeah.
