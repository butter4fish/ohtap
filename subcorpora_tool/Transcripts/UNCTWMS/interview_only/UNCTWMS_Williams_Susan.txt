Jessica Wilkerson: This is July 10, 2009, and I&#8217;m at the Highlander Research and Education Center with Susan Williams.  Okay, Susan, I want to just start by asking you what early experiences influenced your career as an activist?
Susan Williams: Here&#8217;s what I answer now about this.  I say, one thing is I grew up at the tail end of the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s.  I graduated from high school in &#8217;73 so I was kind of on the tail end of that so I wasn&#8217;t so active in stuff but I saw a lot of movement as a young person, so I think that sort of gave me the idea that people should take things on and work on them, and I worked some on some anti-nuclear stuff, a little bit of environmental stuff, in school.
JW: Where did you grow up?
SW: I grew up in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where they make nuclear materials, and we moved there when I was three.  So I grew up there, and one thing I think actually affected me was I was--I always say this but I don&#8217;t know if people [Laughs]--I was very  young during the Cuban crisis and so I was in this town where people said, oh, this is good.  It makes you safe.  It&#8217;s good, it&#8217;s good.  But then as a very young person we had a period of time where we wore dog tags and we had bomb drills, and I was very young.  I was about, what, second grade, I think.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Sixty-one or &#8217;62.  So I was scared to death by this experience, didn&#8217;t really understand what it was, but it was very terrifying to me, and so I always think it made me skeptical of the dominant line, I think, in some early way, [Laughs] that made me more questioning, maybe, later.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Because I never quite believed what they said in Oak Ridge, which may be kind of--.  And they did a lot to pound it into your head, you know, that science was good, and this would protect us, blah, blah, blah, so I sort of think that might have had something to do with the fact that I was more skeptical than other people about the normal paradigm, but it probably was the &#8217;60s, seeing what people did.  The environmental stuff was going on and I cared a lot about East Tennessee and the land and stuff so that was probably the thing that I felt most connected to.  The war--.  My brother would have been in the draft but they ended the draft right before he would have been in it so I didn&#8217;t have people in my personal family that were affected by the draft but there were people older than me that were having to go through that draft for the war, which adds a whole other level to anti-war stuff, when people are waiting for their number on TV once a year and trying to figure out if they&#8217;re going to have to go, or go to Canada, or what are they going to do, so.
JW: When you say you saw people being active in the &#8217;60s, was it family or was it kind of just out there?
SW: It wasn&#8217;t family because my family wasn&#8217;t--.  It wasn&#8217;t my family.  It was kind of out there.  I mean you saw it on the TV.  There would be some stuff, like I remember when Kent State happened and people in my high school, we wore arm bands.  I was kind of in the hippie crew, so the hippies would [Laughs] occasionally [have assimilation] into the outer world.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: There was--.  I don&#8217;t remember, but you know it&#8217;s like--.  I think there was a protest when Nixon--I guess I was a little bit older--the protest when Nixon wouldn&#8217;t--.  The people that got arrested at UT when Billy--.  [No, it was] when Billy Graham came.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: You know there was a protest when Billy Graham came to the stadium at UT and these anti-war people stood up and they got arrested,--
JW: I didn&#8217;t--.
SW: --and I was in high school, I think, then.  So there was manifestations that you&#8217;d see.  I remember the cafeteria in Oak Ridge got--.  There was civil rights stuff going on in Oak Ridge but my family wasn&#8217;t part of it.  But you know I thought about it actually because I went to a camp, a Presbyterian camp, and I think I went the year they decided to integrate it, because it was white and black kids.  But we were just kids so I wasn&#8217;t really thinking about it, but I think that was probably some deliberate thing, and I think my mother&#8217;s friend called mom and said, &#8220;It&#8217;d be really good if Susan came to this camp,&#8221; because she was from the church that was trying to get people to the camp.  So one of my really good friends in high school I met there, and I think that that was probably part of the integration stuff, but I was just at camp, so. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: And actually the schools--.  I remember in sixth grade they brought this one African American girl to our class because what they did was they took the people in Scarborough, which is a black community that&#8217;s segregated in Oak Ridge, and they sort of dispersed these kids everywhere, so there was this one poor child that they brought to our sixth grade class, and I remember I don&#8217;t think she was there very long because--.  I mean, imagine, that&#8217;s the way you integrate is you just disperse these people all over the school system, and I think that&#8217;s what they did.  But my family wasn&#8217;t politically active, so.  I did go to the Presbyterian church that was more active, kind of more political, and then I went to Chapel Hill, so there was a lot of stuff going on at Chapel Hill when I was there, including streaking. [Laughs]
JW: What did you do in Chapel Hill?
SW: I went to school there for my first two years of college.
JW: Oh, I didn&#8217;t know that.
SW: Mm hmm, because I had family from North Carolina, so.  Then my great-uncle, who was a dairy farmer in Mebane, which is not far, I would go visit them a lot and he--. [Laughs] He said I was going to the communist school. [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs]
SW: Because he went to--.  He [grew up] going to State and--
JW: Uh huh.
SW: --he&#8217;s like, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to that communist school,&#8221; [Laughs] which I think was what attracted me to Chapel Hill, was that I knew it was more progressive but it was still in the region.
JW: Uh huh.
SW: Like I didn&#8217;t want to--.  I wanted something more progressive, I think, somewhere in the back of my brain because I didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I went there for two years and took biology and tried to figure out what I wanted to be.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I was always trying to figure out what I wanted to be and never could figure out what I wanted to be.  I was like, maybe I should be a nurse; maybe I should be a doctor; maybe I should be a--.  I liked biology but I didn&#8217;t really want to be a scientist.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So anyway, that&#8217;s, you know, who knows.  I do have a great--.  I have an aunt--I just saw her--and I think partly having this aunt helped me think that I could do something weird, because she went off to the Peace--.  Most of my aunts--.  There&#8217;s nine kids in their family, and most of them went to college, which was actually kind of unusual, they went to college and then they got a job and most of them had the same job their whole lives.  One was a professor, one was a vet, one was a--couple of engineers, so they would kind of like go and they&#8217;d just stay in these kind of normal jobs but my aunt, she was the youngest, she got out of college and she went into the Peace Corps in Africa.  She got married in the Peace Corps to a guy from Vermont and she moved up there and she started this funny little business.  And I just saw her recently and I have a lot of memories of her, and I think that also somehow in the back of my brain was, oh, if Aunt Diane can go do weird things I can go do weird things too.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: At least for awhile. [Laughs]
JW: Yeah. [Laughs]
SW: But maybe I have to get a real job. [Laughs]
JW: Yeah.  So what were your first organizing experiences?
SW: I guess as an actual paid organizer it was with SOCM [Save Our Cumberland Mountains, pronounced &#8220;sock-em&#8221;].  I mean I was part of some groups--.  It&#8217;s all kind of vague to me.  There was some anti-nuke stuff that was happening when I was in high school and college and we were going to some stuff, but I don&#8217;t guess I would have called myself an organizer, just kind of a member of a group doing stuff.  But I got hired by SOCM in &#8217;79.  I was trying to figure out what I wanted to be and somebody told me I should apply for this job.  They didn&#8217;t call it organizer.  They said staff person for SOCM.  I didn&#8217;t like strip mining so I thought, well, I don&#8217;t like strip mining.  This sounds more interesting than working at the Cracker Barrel, which was what I was doing right then, because I got out of school with a degree in biology, which was--.  So I went to Chapel Hill, went for two years, dropped out of school for a year, went to Europe, traveled around, came back, ended up finishing biology because I couldn&#8217;t decide what else to do because I didn&#8217;t know what to do, but finished at UT.  So then I was out of school with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in biology which is really not good for much of anything because there&#8217;s a million of them because all the pre-meds, pre-dents, nursing, everybody has them, so it wasn&#8217;t like it then gave you a lot of opportunity for a job that you would want, which really what I wanted to be was the naturalist at a state park.  That would have been the perfect job, but there was only like three.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So somebody convinced--.  Shirley Harkins who worked at SOCM said, &#8220;You should apply for this job.&#8221; [Laughs] She was working so I would go to her house and she took me to some strip mine hearings and I was like, I don&#8217;t really understand this, but it&#8217;s bound to be--.  You know, I could do this for awhile.  It&#8217;s more interesting than Cracker Barrel, working as a grill cook.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I applied for a job and it took them forever to hire me and they didn&#8217;t--.  They didn&#8217;t really have words for what we were so I would just kind of follow them around and try to figure out what to do. [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs]
SW: So I went there in &#8217;79, but--I may be jumping ahead. [Laughs]
JW: Oh, no.  You can jump ahead if you want to.
SW: So one of the first things I did with SOCM was they sent me to Highlander to help SOCM do the land ownership part of the study in Tennessee, so that was in retrospect pretty important for what things I learned during that, also having relationships with Highlander and giving me a grounding for the work in the region in terms of who owns the land and who controls the land and how the courthouses work.  So that was one of the first things I did with SOCM, and that was really, I think, important that I had that experience when I first came.
JW: Mm hmm.  Okay, so what--?  I don&#8217;t--.  So you were at UT, or you were in college and traveling in Europe when the women&#8217;s movement was pretty--.  I mean it was at its peak in those years.
SW: Mm hmm.
JW: So what was your experience with the women&#8217;s movement or what was your understanding of feminism at that time?
SW: That&#8217;s a good question.  I don&#8217;t--. [Pause]  You know I think it--.  Here&#8217;s one thing that I think is true in my family is that I didn&#8217;t feel confined by traditional women&#8217;s roles by how I was raised, so my family never said to me, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get married?&#8221;  My family never said--.  They never--.  And part of it I think is because my great aunts, their father died when they were young but they were big believers in education so my great aunts, all four of them, went to college and they all worked.  So part of it I think is that I had in some ways a less traditional background on that side of the family.  It turns out my great-grandfather was also a socialist, so.  But they all went to college and that was really unusual, so that&#8217;s what I grew up knowing, that my great aunts had all gone to college and they all worked and I didn&#8217;t feel like I was confined by what--.  And that was probably the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, like you don&#8217;t have to just be what everybody&#8217;s always been.  You can be something else.  So I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the women's--.  I mean was that the women&#8217;s movement, was that the &#8217;60s, was that how I was raised; I don&#8217;t know, because I didn&#8217;t think about the women&#8217;s movement.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: I mean I remember reading about it, thinking it was good, but it wasn&#8217;t like I was ever part of a group, I don&#8217;t think.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: And I guess they probably had them but I just--.  It wasn&#8217;t--.  I guess I had the benefits of it [Laughs] already, you know, so I didn&#8217;t feel confined really by--.  And I thought what they were fighting for was right but I didn&#8217;t have really direct exposure to it, I think because of what you&#8217;re saying.  Who talked about the women&#8217;s movement was people in other places, and there probably were some local groups but I don&#8217;t remember them being real visible at the colleges I was at.  But who knows.  It&#8217;s all kind of a--.  When I was at UT I was working every weekend so I had less time because I was in school and working so I&#8217;d go to Gatlinburg and work on the weekends, and I was more active in Chapel Hill when I wasn&#8217;t working than I was when I went to UT.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But I don&#8217;t have a memory of women&#8217;s groups, although I&#8217;m sure they were there.  I&#8217;d read stuff, you know.  I got Ms. Magazine for awhile at some point in my life.  I don&#8217;t know when that was. [Laughs] I always agreed with the women&#8217;s movement. [Laughs]
JW: Uh huh.  Well how do you think growing up in and then later even organizing in the South shaped your understanding of women&#8217;s issues, not necessarily the women&#8217;s movement, but just women&#8217;s issues in general?
SW: Well you know the issues that the women&#8217;s movement talked about would come up in workshops all the time.  I mean a lot of--.  Not so much pay because I didn&#8217;t really work on economic stuff until later, but dynamics for women.  Issues would come up around how their husbands thought of the--.  Stuff would come up in workshops about women and sometimes the workshops actually made women feel more capable of being more free, which often endangered their relationships with men.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I think the process of--.  There were people that I worked with at SOCM whose husbands would get nervous that they would go over this. [Laughs]  But I don&#8217;t know if that was--.  I&#8217;m not exactly--if it was a fear of what we were working on, or--.  I mean it was related to the role they thought their wives should play, so I worked with people who were--.  A lot of people were in kind of more traditional situations but were stepping out and so I saw it more in how they had to navigate that world and how they navigated with their spouses, usually.  I mean that&#8217;s sort of how it came up, is people&#8217;s relationships and trying to have people be part of an organization.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: That&#8217;s kind of how I think about it, and that&#8217;s true for workshops.  Stuff would come up sort of as a result of people sharing their stories, and sometimes pretty impressive stories about how people grew up.  But when people--.  But I would meet people--.  Actually this happened more to me when I worked with TIRN [Tennessee Industrial Renewal Network] because I was going out more and people were like, &#8220;Are you part of the women&#8217;s movement?&#8221; or &#8220;Do you work on women&#8217;s issues?&#8221;  I&#8217;m like, it seems like I do, but I would say back to them kind of what I would say, and it wasn&#8217;t the answer that they were thinking, because you weren&#8217;t in a women&#8217;s group, because I never was in a women&#8217;s group.  I was always in groups with lots of women and men, but always more women than men, always more women than men.  So I think it is true that it had different ways it played out, you know.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Like issues around [14:27] how women are treated and what opportunities there are and less about the economic status of women, maybe because the economic status of a lot of people wasn&#8217;t--.  It wasn&#8217;t like you could think you were going to make a lot more money, even if you were paid the same as men,--
JW: Right.
SW: --right, because there were a lot of low wage jobs, so.  A lot of people worked in factories and I don&#8217;t know how that plays out in factories, because when people talk about it, it tends to be more white collar kinds of jobs.
JW: Mm hmm.  So did you think about integrating those women&#8217;s concerns into the meeting or was it more a space where you could freely discuss these issues and feel like, you know, it was a safe space to talk about those things?
SW: I think because I was work--.  When I was organizing we were working on specific issues that weren&#8217;t women&#8217;s issues.  It was strip mining or a toxic waste dump or a National Guard center, so it would come up--.  I also stayed with people, I&#8217;d spend a lot of time with people, so sometimes it would just come up because I knew people pretty well and sometimes it would--.  It didn&#8217;t usually come up in organizing meetings because people were in their communities but that kind of stuff would often tend to come up more like at a workshop at Highlander, so I was going back and forth to workshops at Highlander but I think of actually hearing more stories once I came to Highlander and thinking about how this plays out for women once I came to Highlander, although I could then look back at SOCM and say, oh.  See SOCM had more women than men on the staff, always had a lot of women on the board, so it was kind of a more--.  In some ways it had been founded with strong women, so.
JW: Mm hmm.  So you said at some of the workshops or some of these meetings it seemed there were usually more women than there were men.  Why do you think that, that there were more women?
SW: I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s usually true, at workshops here.  The only time it hasn&#8217;t been true is around immigration, because--early in immigration.  Actually now there&#8217;s more women but early because so many more men were coming than women it was kind of funny to me the first time I went.  It was like there was all these men and hardly any women.  I&#8217;m like, this is really--.  I&#8217;m not used to this. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: I don&#8217;t really know why.  I think that is generally true, that in groups women--.  And if you&#8217;d like me to [16:52] why it&#8217;s women, I think women aren&#8217;t often the people that are seen but they&#8217;re often the people doing the work.  It&#8217;s like in churches.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: The people doing the work are often the women.
JW: Mm hmm.

SW: So they&#8217;re not necessarily the leaders, but they&#8217;re--.  And I don&#8217;t know, is that because they&#8217;re more--.  I don&#8217;t know why.  I mean I don&#8217;t really know why.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: I used to think with SOCM maybe it was because we were more women so women were more comfortable working with us, and that could be part of it, like whoever the organizer is.  That may change the gender.  But since I&#8217;ve been here and seen workshops, and I&#8217;ve worked with lots of men here, although not [so much now] [Laughs] but, so I don&#8217;t really know why.  I mean with plant closings I think I know why, when I worked on that, and I think that--.  Anyway.  That&#8217;s kind of jumping forward.
JW: Oh, you can go ahead and jump.
SW: So with the Tennessee Industrial Renewal Network, when we were working on plant closings, it was really hard to get the men involved, and I think that&#8217;s because for men the role a job plays in their idea of themselves is so much bigger in a way, that they&#8217;re more traumatized, so it was harder for them to--.  And they are actually less likely to show emotion, so I think the experience in some ways is more traumatic for men and it&#8217;s harder for them to work on it because they&#8217;re actually going through more stuff than women do because women don&#8217;t have quite as much of a stake with their identity at their job.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So that&#8217;s why I thought that men were less likely to work on plant closings than women, because that was really true.  With other issues I just think it&#8217;s because maybe women are more comfortable in groups.  I don&#8217;t know why, really.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: I just think it&#8217;s kind of true, [Laughs]--
JW: Yeah, and it&#8217;s interesting too.
SW: --from my experience, and I don&#8217;t know really why.
JW: Uh huh.
SW: I just sort of take it for granted that that&#8217;s going to be true and that a lot of the people doing the work are the women, because that&#8217;s my experience.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: And you may not know--.  The leaders may be men. [Laughs] But the groups I worked in were more mixed gender, so.
JW: Yeah.  Well how--?  Do you want to go ahead and say what led you to participate in the organizing of the Tennessee Industrial Renewal Network, and also describe what that process was like, because you were one of the founding members, right?
SW: Yeah.  Well I&#8217;d come to Highlander--.  I got more interested in economics at SOCM.  We had set up a--.  So I worked at SOCM from &#8217;79 to &#8217;89, so I did a lot of work there on lots of different issues, but toward the end we kept saying and then decided to try to deal with it more directly, which we&#8217;re trying to do again, like the economics is so important for what happens in these rural counties and we have to look at the economics.  Highlander was doing some work on economics and education so I may have got that idea from coming here.  I don&#8217;t remember.  So I came to Highlander to do this economic environmental program.  The idea was that people work on economics or they work on environment and they&#8217;re made to think that those are at odds but really they need to be connected.  It&#8217;s the idea of sustainability but when I first did it that word wasn&#8217;t in common use, but it&#8217;s kind of like what is a sustainable community so what are actually ways people can do that, so that&#8217;s what I came to Highlander to do, that program.  That was interesting because I&#8217;d done a lot of environmental work but I really felt like economics was really critical, and actually just this morning I was saying we have to look at economics.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I came to do that and so I was doing that program and then Highlander, the union, which was ACTWU [Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union] then, and CORA [Commission on Religion in Appalachia] had gotten involved in the whole issue around plant closings and trying to raise that up as an issue in Tennessee, partly because ACTWU kept having these plant closings, nobody was talking about those kind of jobs leaving, and the jobs that replaced them were not equivalent in terms of wages or benefits, so people were like, oh, well we&#8217;ve got all these new jobs, but they&#8217;re maybe part time, they&#8217;re service.  So they had a project to try to raise that up, the issue, and they got money to do a conference and so I came in when they were starting to plan the conference and John&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh--.&#8221;  I was like, &#8220;I need some more to do.&#8221; [Laughs] He&#8217;s like, &#8220;Well here.  Why don&#8217;t you come help plan this conference?&#8221;  So I did, and it was really an amazing experience because it was the first time I&#8217;d been with labor and community people in Tennessee who were--.  Well actually I hadn't worked with labor people at that point.  I had kind of a romantic notion of labor because my mother&#8217;s from Pittsburgh so my grandfather worked in the steel mills so I have this kind of idealistic thing about labor people.  You know there&#8217;s times when--I said this about TIRN--there&#8217;s times when people come together and they&#8217;re ready to work and so you just have to ride the energy and see what happens, and that&#8217;s kind of what happened at that.  We had lots of good resource people, it was a good conference, we had a lot of local people working on stuff, it had really good energy, and at the end people wanted to do something, which we weren&#8217;t assuming, but it was just one of those times.  I remember the stories people told were really moving to me, and I think it&#8217;s probably because my family&#8217;s from Pittsburgh.  My mother&#8217;s family&#8217;s from Pittsburgh and so I saw Pittsburgh as a kid when it was lively and I went back to Pittsburgh when it was de-industrialized and I was really--.  Although I never spent a lot of time in Pittsburgh I also have this sort of psychic connection to industrial work.  It&#8217;s kind of funny.  Why do I have that?  I don&#8217;t really know, but that&#8217;s why I love factories.  [Whispers] I love to go to factories.  I don&#8217;t know why.
JW: [Laughs]
SW: And Maxine Waller came and she gave this really moving story about when the plant closed in Ivanhoe, in her community, and her husband made this very moving statement about what it did to him, and I remember crying on the way home because of the stories people told about what the effects are of a plant closing, so it&#8217;s not--.  You can just look at it kind of neutrally, but when people talk about what it means to them, it&#8217;s really very moving.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: And I was like, we have to do something.  So I remember driving home, I was crying, I was like we have to do something, not knowing what to do, because I don&#8217;t know anything about factories or economics.  But there&#8217;s times when there&#8217;s that energy, and that happened with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Wives Coalition, I think.  This energy came so let&#8217;s just ride it and see where it gets, because that energy doesn&#8217;t come along every, you know, it doesn&#8217;t always come along, so if you have it you should help it, and that&#8217;s kind of how I felt, from an organizing standpoint.
So Bill Troy was working on it, and I guess Doug and Mark at the union, and--who would there have been at CORA?  I guess Bill was working for CORA but doing this as a project.  So I just started helping--.  People had some working groups and we just started pulling people together and I was working with the plant closing people, and I loved working with plant closings.  It was mostly women, and I loved doing it, probably because I learned--.  I mean, I didn&#8217;t know what we should do but I could get people together.  I mean what my skills were, I could get people together and talk about what they needed to talk about, because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d learned how to do at SOCM.  I didn&#8217;t have any particular educational background that helped me on this, so.  It&#8217;s sort of like helping do something that seems useful, that&#8217;s sort of how I think about it, so I had some skills so I just was sort of helping.  I was at Highlander just kind of helping, trying to help stuff happen, and it was really exciting that people wanted to work together in the state on these issues.  To me that was really exciting and lots of good energy and lots of good ideas and so that&#8217;s kind of how I got tied up with TIRN.  I ended up working half time with Highlander and half time with TIRN for about ten years.
JW: What kinds of activities did you start to organize?
SW: Well we did two--.  One was just there was a [24:25] what the organization would be and then there were some working groups so I worked with the plant closing working group.  The first thing we did, we did a displaced workers think tank [Laughs] and we brought people together.   ACTWU knew people and then the Center for Literacy Studies had done a research process with Levi&#8217;s workers so there was these different people that were kind of connected in so we brought people together to talk about what should we do, and I don&#8217;t remember quite how--.  We decided to try to form these little rapid response teams and train people so we did the displaced think tank and then we had a series of training workshops to help people think about how they might go out to plant closings and help people who had had the experience, and we did a manual, a plant closing manual, which we did all together.  What was really, I think, good about it was that we really were basing it off people&#8217;s experiences and what they already knew, and so the manual&#8217;s both a kind of official version and then actually what really happens, and for someone like--.  Cheryl Wolf worked at--.  She was chair of TIRN for awhile and she was part of the plant closing stuff.  She worked at Delta Apparel, which is where Cherokee Mills became Delta Apparel, and she&#8217;d grown up, I think, in that neighborhood, that old mill neighborhood.  No, maybe--.  Anyway she worked in factories her whole life, but she was part of this and she was really--.  These people knew so much and they knew a lot about plant closings because some of them had been through it, so the idea was to try to get the information to people before the plant would close, to try to keep the plant open or if not to try to make sure people knew as well as you could about what they should try to do.  If a sixty-day notice was passed they should get a sixty-day notice, and--.  But, so that was really I think for--.
Because I think one thing that happens, and people would say this, in the end organizing around a plant closing isn&#8217;t really a good way to--.  If you&#8217;re trying to build an organization it&#8217;s not really a way to build the organization because people disperse so people have had these--.  You can&#8217;t usually get people to look at it before it closes because their denial&#8217;s so strong and their fears are really strong.  Then once it closes all the dispersion starts happening and people have so much to deal with, so keeping people attached to an organization with the thing that held them gone turns out not to be [Laughs] a very good [way to organize a group.]
So actually I did that for awhile, Bill did some work with people in Clinton, we hired Bob at some point and he did some work with people in Clarksville, so we did some--.  The thing about the rapid response teams is most people were around Knoxville and the plants would close in Clarksville or Clinton, so having the people that were affected be able to go out was hard, because they were all working, of course, so that scheme didn&#8217;t work so well, but I think it did help us all get kind of an education about what was going on.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: It&#8217;s not just about your own factory, it&#8217;s not just about you, it&#8217;s not just about the workers; it&#8217;s about corporate decisions being made to make more money, and maybe they&#8217;re moving here, so that&#8217;s what led us to go to maquilas because a lot of them were moving to the border, in Mexico, during that period.  So I helped plan the trip to go to the maquiladoras the first time, which was in &#8217;91.  So I transferred in &#8217;89, so in &#8217;91 one of the things that was true was plants were moving to Mexico, Fran got hooked up with some people, she talked to Shirley Reinhardt, somebody cooked up a plan that we should take people to Mexico, so I helped do that trip and actually went on the first trip.  I wasn&#8217;t supposed to but someone dropped out because she lost her and then she got a job so there was an empty place and the alternates couldn&#8217;t go, so I actually got to go which to me was really an amazing, really amazing education. [Laughs] And that&#8217;s what got us to working on trade, because it was--.  So that was &#8217;91 and NAFTA was being negotiated in secret, but Fran kept telling us about NAFTA when we were going to Mexico, and being able to see the maquilas gives you such a concrete way to see the--.  The Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras was forming right then so we met up with them, then we formed a fair trade committee, or a maquiladora committee, or whatever, so I ended up working on that and I guess that&#8217;s when we hired Bob because he started doing plant closings.  So for the rest of the time at TIRN I helped do the work around these exchanges and work around trade.
JW: So what were the most powerful experiences about--?
SW: And that was mostly women.  It was almost all women.
JW: Right.
SW: Yeah.
JW: What were the most powerful experiences going to the maquiladoras and seeing women workers interacting?
SW: Well you know what actually was most striking is seeing the plants and the neighborhoods where people work who had worked where the plants had been in Tennessee, so you know--because the first trip we saw TRW, that had moved not very long before, and the person whose place I took had actually worked for TRW.  So we see the TRW plant and we go visit a neighborhood that is in water because it&#8217;s flooded, and there&#8217;s TRW workers walking into this neighborhood where these kind of little huts are, because they settled on this land and it turned out to be a lake and then it rained and it got full of water.  So it gives you this way to see what corporate capitalism does in such a concrete way.  The stories of people were important but it gave me such a way to view the structure of how things worked because up here they maybe made, I don&#8217;t know what.  They had a decent home.  Down there it&#8217;s a beautiful factory but the houses are terrible and they&#8217;re flooded, and that&#8217;s where the workers are, and they think that&#8217;s okay.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: [Laughs] That is really not okay, so I think for me in terms of a larger analysis it gave me a way to see what the globalization was really.  I&#8217;d worked around--.  Now I realize, like I grew up in Oak Ridge; it was run by Union Carbide.  I worked on strip mining; there were all these corporations.  The mining companies, [there&#8217;s the toxic waste companies], [Laughs] so my life has actually been formed by working with people around corporate things and so factories were just another way corporations made their way in the world that hurt people, so that&#8217;s why I think for me I have a very much bigger sense of why the system is bad, because there were all these corporations kind of floating around.  So Union Carbide runs Oak Ridge and then they have Bhopal.  Well that&#8217;s not good.  How&#8217;d they get away with that?  And then we find out they--.  Then we also know they caused all this pollution in Oak Ridge, which was partly government security and haphazardness and partly a corporate mentality.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So, but I didn&#8217;t know much about Mexico at all.  I also realized, how little do I know about this country that is right next door and how amazing is that, that I know so little about this place.  So it really made me start paying attention to Mexico, which is what&#8217;s also made me start paying attention to immigration here, because the first thing I remember was that people came back from there, from Morristown, and they came to a meeting for the maquiladoras.  We came back, we did a slide show and we would go out and show it, and then NAFTA was happening so we&#8217;d show it in the context of NAFTA, so it was really good timing for helping a trip become something--helping us have a way to understand it and work on something much bigger, which is not what our plan was.  It was all very fortunate timing in a way because of NAFTA.  And you know we brought people from Mexico; we brought workers here; we brought people from Canada here; we tried to have an interna--.  We also tried to counter the xenophobic view, because Ross Perot was floating around, like no, it&#8217;s not--.  We don&#8217;t want to blame the Mexican workers. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.


SW: We want to get at the system that is causing this and that is not the Mexican workers, so trying to have not a xenophobic way to look at trade was part of our aim, so that was, I think, important, and that&#8217;s why relationships and going to Mexico was important and people coming here because it is so hard for people to know.  People don&#8217;t know anything about Mexico.  They don&#8217;t--.  I mean it&#8217;s amazing how little we know; Canada, for that matter, too.
JW: Yeah.
SW: So it probably changed my life in a way, made me start studying Spanish, I&#8217;ve been to Mexico a bunch, I&#8217;ve done a lot of work on trade, I think about economics all the time, I get mad all the time. [Laughs] I&#8217;m mad again.  This last fall it just was like, this is ridiculous.  And it gave me a way to think, yeah, we could work on bigger stuff and we have to.  We can work on NAFTA out of Tennessee.  Yes, we can. [Laughs] But I remember when Shirley Reinhardt and I, we went up to--.  So we did this trip and then we did a slideshow and then someone asked us to come to Washington and show our slideshow, I think it was church based people who did policy work, and I went with Shirley Reinhardt, this woman from Morristown, who&#8217;d helped start this group of Citizens Against Temporary Services, so actually that&#8217;s a whole other story because the whole change from permanent to part time jobs was happening and nobody really realized it, so this group, Citizens Against Temporary Services formed in Morristown that was an incredible group because they were like the canaries in the mines.  We&#8217;re like, what are they talking about?  We don&#8217;t really understand what they&#8217;re talking about, because temporary work was seen as Kelly Girls filling in for you when you went on vacation.
JW: Uh huh.
SW: That&#8217;s how people thought of it.  So like, what, temporary jobs in factories?  What?  That&#8217;s not right.  What?  They organized in Morristown which is, I think, an incredible story, and were naming something that was actually a global trend. [Laughs] The truth was with TIRN we were working on global trends but we weren&#8217;t planning to work on global trends. [Laughs] We just found out that&#8217;s what we were working on.  It&#8217;s like, oh, [contingent] work; well that's everywhere. [Laughs]
JW: Uh huh.
SW: And that&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t want us to pass a bill here because they&#8217;re actually doing this everywhere.  So, you know, yeah, it was just--.  It&#8217;s what got me thinking about immigration, it&#8217;s what made me interested in immigration, because I saw it so much as what was happening--.  What was frustrating to me partly about the discourse here is that nobody talked about why were people coming, and I&#8217;d seen NAFTA and I&#8217;d heard people talk about what was going to happen and people displaced from the land and I knew the peso had devalued and so I knew all this stuff about why were people coming, but here it was like as if it was some random thing that suddenly a bunch of people from Mexico are coming, and it was so related to things that our country had helped do.  It helped me get, I think, an analysis that is something that I&#8217;ve tried to work on to help people get, but it&#8217;s not very easy because there&#8217;s so little discourse, dominant discourse, that talks about any of this stuff with any kind of depth to it.  I mean the whole immigration thing has no depth to it.  It doesn&#8217;t help people understand anything at all.  It&#8217;s designed to inflame people.  They make people scared and hurt people who have to come here because they&#8217;re trying to survive. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.  Well how did you all make the decision to have women workers involved in this project, From the Mountains to the Maquiladoras?
SW: I guess the first trip was women because we were going to go visit a group of women, so we were going to visit the CFO group, the Comit&#233; Fronterizo de Obreras, and they were women&#8217;s groups, so I guess the first trip was women, except we had a male interpreter with us, but that was why the first trip was women.  The trips after that weren&#8217;t.  But it was because we had a--.  Our idea was that we would have an ongoing relationship with this group but the language--.  It didn&#8217;t work because we didn&#8217;t have any translation skills on our side and they didn&#8217;t either, so that also got me thinking about language and I think why I&#8217;ve been supportive of trying to deal with language here because--.  And also I went to meetings where there was good translation because there were these international meetings around trade where they had people doing really good translation, and I had the experience of that.  So we ended up not being able to have an ongoing relationship with this group which was kind of what our idea was, that we would try to kind of have an ongoing thing, but it just didn&#8217;t happen, probably for a number of reasons, but part of it was just basic language.  We didn&#8217;t have a way to--.  I started taking Spanish but I&#8217;m not good enough to be a translator, and never will be.  Then other trips went to other parts of the border, so we were part of the Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras but not just with that eastern part of the border.
JW: Well I've talked to [Lavernal] Clark about--.
SW: Oh, you did?
JW: Actually a few years ago when I was doing--
SW: Oh, when you interviewed people--.
JW: --[37:14] stuff.
SW: Yeah, yeah.
JW: I need to look her up again and talk to her some more, because this was such a major experience for her.  I remember she kept going back to that and what it was like to see other workers and have this global perspective and it seems like it must have been just overwhelming for people to see the differences and to see what these corporations were doing, and I wonder if you have any anecdotes or stories about what you came back with and what sort of conversations grew out of that trip?
SW: Well we did a bunch of interviews with people and there&#8217;s a chapter in Barbara Ellen Smith&#8217;s book that has people talking about the experience, so you should look that.  It was interesting because I think I don&#8217;t know what it would have felt like to be a factory worker and go there.  I think that must have been so much more emotional because it was so much more real, and the people we took were Phillips workers, [Lavernal], who worked at Allied, Shirley, who worked at Morristown--two people worked at Morristown, her and Barbara--so they were all people whose companies had sent jobs to the border.  So I thought there was lots of drama and emotional stuff, plus we were exhausted because we weren&#8217;t getting enough sleep, plus it was emotional because what we were seeing was really--.  I remember especially that neighborhood where the water was and talking to people, and you think, this is where people live who are working in these factories.  This is where they live.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: You know I remember some people saying, &#8220;I thought I grew up poor, but this--.&#8221;  I remember Joanne, I think, [38:58] saying, &#8220;Well I would go across the river too.&#8221; [Laughs] So the thing that was good, I think, we had people agree to do follow up and commit to doing follow up and a number of people did.  Some people didn&#8217;t.  The main people who didn't were the Phillips people, and I don&#8217;t know, the whole dynamic was kind of ugly.  So we had a committee--.  So it gave us time to sort of--and we put together a slideshow--so it gave us time to kind of talk about it and take things out so I think in some ways the fact that we did--.  And a bunch of people were already involved in TIRN so it gave us a way to sort of keep thinking about it with each other, and then we were learning about NAFTA, so--. [Pause] Yeah, my main memories are from the trips, not so much about--.  We had tons of conversations because we kept meeting and we&#8217;d take stuff and we&#8217;d try to get it shown and then we started working on NAFTA so it was partly about what are we going to do about NAFTA.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But years later when the Cook Food workers were organizing there was a--.  Ann Lewis, who was working on Morristown, interviewed Joanne and Shirley who came out in support of the immigrant workers at the chicken plant, and they were talking about that it really changed their view, but it&#8217;s hard to tell other people about it.  It&#8217;s hard to explain it to other people because of the anti-immigrant stuff.  In some ways the most practical effect was what are you going to do in terms of trying to deal with anti-immigrant stuff here after NAFTA was [done].  That was actually always a challenge for us because it was so hard to figure out how to help people.  That&#8217;s why keeping taking trips was a good idea.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But it was also, you know, as the economy in like Morristown declined, there was also declining economies, so as economies declined that&#8217;s when peoples fears and anxieties grow, right, so that&#8217;s when the anti-immigrant stuff gets worse.  The whole way everything was playing out has been hard to watch because it&#8217;s like how do you actually affect the dominant discourse about this stuff, and how do trade and immigration people get linked, and that&#8217;s--.  I just saw this woman who--.  I&#8217;m just kind of rambling.
JW: Oh, that's okay.
SW: [Laughs] Just, [blah! blah!]  I just saw this woman, [Chela], who after NAFTA was passed, there was this after NAFTA meeting and Fran and I went.  I don&#8217;t know if somebody else went or not but we went to it, and there was this woman who does work in Mexico and she stood up and she said, &#8220;We need to link immigration and trade and globalization because they&#8217;re very linked,&#8221; and we voted, yes, that was good and we did, and then in the U.S. it never happened.  I just saw her at a meeting at the Solidarity Economy meeting and I said, &#8220;You know, [Chela], you were so right and we so didn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;  We tried to.  They have separate groups; they&#8217;re separate [campaigns]; they&#8217;re separate strategies; so this kind of larger analysis is I think in some ways I&#8217;ve been left with a need for us to think about looking at larger structural issues around economics, and I&#8217;ve been on the same track recently.  I was like this is ridiculous, what it does to people, this system.  What it does to people is just really unbearable.  If we don&#8217;t look at the system then we can&#8217;t change things.  So, that's what it actually did for me, so sometimes it makes me just feel crazy. [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs] Well have you--?  I&#8217;m thinking of the film.  The Morristown film is the one where some of the women who went to the maquiladoras spoke in that film, right?  They were interviewing them.
SW: Yeah, yeah.
JW: Have you shown that much in working communities?  I wonder what people&#8217;s reactions are?
SW: I&#8217;ve heard people talking about showing it.  I haven&#8217;t had the chance to show it much because of what my job is now.  We showed it at UT when we did a film series, and that was interesting.
JW: Yeah, that&#8217;s where I saw it.
SW: Were you there?
JW: Yeah.
SW: Yeah.  A couple of people from Morristown were saying, &#8220;Oh--.&#8221;  We kept wanting to show it in Morristown but we haven&#8217;t quite figured out how to do that.  We had the idea we would do it with the people that were in it but then trying to get people organized to come see it who were in it was very hard.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But I&#8217;ve heard people talk about showing it in different places and how useful it is, and I thought that was interesting because I remember the people from Morristown said, oh, I learned a lot of things that are really helpful to me, about why this is happening, you know.  I think Ann [Lewis] is a really good filmmaker because she kind of lets people speak for themselves so it registers more with you instead of somebody who has a script and try to fit people&#8217;s words in.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But she had so much footage. [Laughs]
JW: It was a great film.  So what would you say were the most important--?  You&#8217;ve sort of gone over this a little bit but I&#8217;ll just ask it a different way.  What were the most important outcomes of the Mountains to Maquiladoras Project?
SW: I think that we worked on NAFTA.  It got us working on trade issues, I think was important, and working on that actually in some ways made--.  Because we didn't beat NAFTA and our congressional people changed their minds at the last minute, but it forced the pro-trade people to come out of the closet and have to show this massive movement to try to buy votes, so it made the machine much more visible, which I thought was good. [Laughs]  Because at that point it&#8217;s like, what do you mean you&#8217;re changing your vote?  But it was this huge machine that rolled out to buy those votes.  Yeah, you know, I don&#8217;t--.  It&#8217;s interesting because I was talking with Doug, who was part of the plant closing stuff, and we were talking about TIRN and for me it was really--.  I was like we didn&#8217;t win but look at what we&#8217;re facing.  We just need to be better organized.  That&#8217;s my opinion.  Doug&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, but we failed.&#8221; [Laughs] Sometimes I think were we crazy to think we could take on plant closings?  Were we crazy?  It&#8217;s the whole thing about what is winnable, what isn&#8217;t, were we crazy, but that was, I think, important for me, is like no, we have to shoot higher.  We have to shoot higher to get further than we are shooting in terms of organizing, so that for me I think in some ways that&#8217;s one thing that--.  We don&#8217;t get anywhere by just dealing with these individual issues.  We have to see the larger analysis and figure out how to get more directed at what the systems are that are causing the problems, and because the economy&#8217;s so much more integrated you really have to do it.  You can&#8217;t just look locally or even regionally.  You just can&#8217;t.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: People keep acting like they can but I don&#8217;t think we can.  So for me that was important, and I don&#8217;t know--. [Laughs] Different people have different opinions about it.  With SOCM we used to talk about it because of the kind of translation of [Saul] Alinsky, although I don&#8217;t think this was so much--.  What he actually really said was you need to pick--.  There was a thing about winnable issues and self interest and so I think it made me think more about if we were better organized could we get higher on the ladder for where the systems are, and NAFTA made me think we could, but it also made me realize one of the problems we have in this country is--and I&#8217;ve seen this with a bunch of issues to do with immigration--there&#8217;s this Washington kind of collection of groups that think about campaigns and then there&#8217;s people outside, and we don&#8217;t have a way to think in terms of movement building that connects with the policy work.  For an example, when I went to that after NAFTA meeting I&#8217;m thinking, oh, this is great; all these people got involved in this; we can keep relationships; we can build a movement.  The Washington people come to this meeting saying okay, now we have to work on GAT.  Go talk to your congressman about GAT.  They did not say anything about what did this mean in terms of who was involved in this and why and where did that come from, because their perspective was kind of this Washington perspective, and immigration is kind of the same way, environmental stuff is the same way.  So I think that that&#8217;s a problem for us in this country, and maybe why we keep not looking at systems, because we have these people in Washington saying, &#8220;We have to be practical, blah, blah, blah.&#8221;  And now they&#8217;re like, oh, well Obama will do it.  I was like well, no, Obama&#8217;s not going to really do it because he can&#8217;t unless we push him, and maybe if we push him he will but I&#8217;m not sure if he will, but let&#8217;s try to push him.  It&#8217;s like we need to regulate financial institutions.  Clearly that is what we need to do because guess what, they were regulated and they got deregulated, and when they were regulated they weren&#8217;t out creating paper based on paper that was complicated that everybody thought was stupid but people were making money.  They weren&#8217;t allowed to do that. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.  But I wonder--.  So with TIRN, it&#8217;s interesting that you had this conversation with Doug about what was successful.
SW: Well it was very funny because I was so struck by it because to me it was so formative of how I think about stuff and it was so formative in terms of what I think would be possible if we were better organized.  Doug&#8217;s analysis was we lost. [Laughs]
JW: Right.

SW: And that&#8217;s why, like you know with the plant closing stuff, I was like were we crazy to do it, because actually organizing around plant closings and making them stop, that was kind of crazy.  But I wouldn&#8217;t not do it again.  So it is a question, I think, for people in this country about what are we trying to shoot for and where is our vision, and I believe that practically you need local campaigns and you need things people can do and you can&#8217;t always work on things that just seem to be completely hopeless.  But actually we didn&#8217;t think NAFTA was hopeless and I think if we&#8217;d been better organized we could have won it.  That&#8217;s my feeling, because I saw what we did here with not a huge--.  I saw what we did here and it made a big difference and people were ready to move if you got them organized about a bigger thing.  It was also a very clear vote, so it was yes or no, so it didn&#8217;t get bought off the way people do when there&#8217;s more fishy water.
JW: Mm hmm.  And I wonder how you, [you know], starting to think about TIRN before it actually completely existed but it was a very personal experience for you, seeing people lose their jobs.  I mean even if it&#8217;s not successful--.
SW: Well it&#8217;s important.  I mean this is an important issue for people to talk about, these kind of jobs disappearing and what&#8217;s replacing them, so that was the first logic.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But there was this Federation of Industrial Retention and Renewal and they were trying to figure out strategies, so that actually helped us think that there were ways to proceed, like there was the [49:49] of a plant closing, so there was stuff that people brought us from the Rust Belt that actually was helpful in terms of thinking there were some strategies.  And actually somebody came and talked about plants moving to the maquilas at that first workshop, so it was a case where there were some people who had already actually experienced deindustrialization sharing a lot of what they knew and that helped us, I think, feel like we could do something, and we were part of FIRR, and FIRR was, I think, a really good formation for how it helped people.  It helped us a lot.  Those connections really helped us a lot because that&#8217;s who we called on for things and that&#8217;s who I would call and that&#8217;s information we would get.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But it is a, you know, it&#8217;s a--.  I think we--.  Sometimes people are like, oh, it&#8217;s too complicated; oh, people aren&#8217;t ready for that; oh, it&#8217;s too this; oh, it&#8217;s too that.  But I don&#8217;t believe that about people, because what I learned I learned from the factory workers and Fran.  I learned as much from the factory workers as I learned from anybody.  It was [Lavernal] Clark who told me to read the business page, the best piece of advice anybody ever gave me, so I&#8217;ve read the business page ever since she told me that and that has really helped me understand economics, and you're encouraged not to read the business page because you&#8217;re not in business.  Why do they call it the business page?  Why don&#8217;t they call it the economics page?  Isn&#8217;t that interesting?  Some of my most important information comes from the people that are the kind of people that people might say, oh, no, it&#8217;s too much, blah, blah, blah. [Laughs] What I couldn&#8217;t really understand after doing stuff with TIRN was why are people so hesitant to look at the larger analysis, even while they&#8217;re doing the local work.  I&#8217;m not saying you shouldn&#8217;t keep doing what you&#8217;re doing, but it&#8217;s sort of the level of analysis you bring in that I think is the question, so it&#8217;s fine to work on local agriculture but shouldn&#8217;t we talk about the larger agricultural systems while you&#8217;re trying to work on local agriculture, because that helps us see the system.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Or, yeah, so, you know, so we did kind of--.  Yeah.
JW: Why do you think there&#8217;s a hesitancy to look at the larger analysis?
SW: Well my latest theory is, because I went to Canada recently for an economic workshop and it reminded me that our brains are colonized here. [Laughs] Here&#8217;s what happened to me.  Last fall the economy melts down.  I am so mad about why isn&#8217;t anyone explaining this.  Why is no one explaining this and shouldn&#8217;t we do something besides just bail out these companies?  There&#8217;s clearly something really wrong with the system, but I don&#8217;t know what it is because I don&#8217;t work on mortgages and stuff.  But I was so mad.  I was like why aren&#8217;t they explaining this?  Because I believe I can understand these things because, why, I understand NAFTA, basically.  I was taught that I could actually understand economics and so I believe I can. [Laughs] So I was really mad but then I sort of went on to other things and I was like we should talk--.  Like why aren't people sending stuff out about regulating financial institutions?  What's happening in Washington and why don&#8217;t I hear anything?  I was so frustrated and I just went to Canada in early June--.  And my first instinct was I need to get people together to talk about economics and what we should be doing and I didn&#8217;t do it because I just went on to my everything--because I kept thinking other people would be doing it but other people didn&#8217;t do it.  You would go places and people wouldn&#8217;t even talk about it.  It was weird.  You&#8217;d be at a conference and people wouldn&#8217;t even be talking about this financial meltdown.  I don&#8217;t understand how people can not even mention it.  It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me.  So I just went to Canada and did this economic literacy workshop, really Canada-based with some other people, and being up there and then coming back here really made me think about how our minds are colonized and how we are in this country that so much promotes this system of capitalism but we won&#8217;t even say it.  We won&#8217;t even say capitalism and we&#8217;ve been taught if we say it then somebody will say, &#8220;You&#8217;re a communist,&#8221; blah, blah, blah.  Somehow we&#8217;re so colonized that it&#8217;s hard for us to actually name the system, so we might do a lot of work on how the political system works but we don&#8217;t do a lot of work on how the economic system works.  Anyway, so my newest thing is we are in denial and we&#8217;re addicted and we have colonized minds. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So there&#8217;s something about that that is keeping us from looking at this system that is causing so much havoc.  We used to say should we talk about neo-liberalism, blah, blah, but we should talk about capitalism, because that&#8217;s what it really is.  That&#8217;s our economic system; it&#8217;s capitalism.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Why shouldn&#8217;t we try to understand it?  And it&#8217;s not really that hard to understand.  So that&#8217;s my new thing, is we have go to look at this system and we&#8217;ve got to name it and we cannot be in denial. [Laughs] I was just talking to [54:33] and she&#8217;s like, well it&#8217;s sort of like what is our fears, and what is our triggers?  It&#8217;s kind of like denial in alcoholism.  How can you deny something that is so in front of your face?  It&#8217;s a lot like that, and part of it we have privilege from the system, generally.  There&#8217;s privilege connected to it.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t look at it.  Something keeps us from actually talking about it and naming it and saying, no, this is not okay, so the economy melts down and we still don&#8217;t do it.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: It&#8217;s clear these financial institutions have been like robbers, like robbers, doing stuff that is completely unbelievable and nobody stopped it.  And Greenspan, all he can say is, &#8220;I was so surprised they did it,&#8221; but if you have a system that&#8217;s actually based on the primary goal being profit by the people who own what else are you going to expect?  It cannot control itself.
JW: Mm hmm.  Well and it&#8217;s so similar to what happened with TIRN, seeing corporations just flee--
SW: Right.
JW: --and nobody doing anything about it.
SW: Right, nobody cared.  It&#8217;s like, yeah.  So I was like--. [Laughs] So that&#8217;s my new theory, is we have some kind of--.  We, as our side, whatever that is, if an economic meltdown doesn&#8217;t make us look at the system then I don&#8217;t know what does, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s been so amazing to me.  So I went to Canada where people talked about the system, so they&#8217;re saying our healthcare system&#8217;s under attach by corporations from the U.S. because they want to make money from our healthcare system, and I was like it is not okay for us--.  It&#8217;s easy for us to say we don&#8217;t need to work on it in some ways because you don&#8217;t have to.  Clearly you don&#8217;t have to because people do all the time.  But it&#8217;s really not okay because our country has so much impact other places, and that is also something I think I got from TIRN.  It&#8217;s not just your responsibility because of what&#8217;s happening to you; it&#8217;s your responsibility because of the role your country plays in the world, and that&#8217;s what I learned a lot about in terms of the economics.  We have responsibility both for ourselves and because of what our country does.  I knew that from the Central America stuff because there was a lot of work done [on solidarity], but not so much around economics.  So, yeah, that&#8217;s been my--. [Laughs] [We have to break through our] denial, we have to say the emperor has no clothes, we have to talk about it and we have to not be afraid to talk about it.  There&#8217;s this guy, Jim Stanford, he came to this workshop.  He&#8217;s an economist for the autoworkers, Canadian autoworkers.  He has a book, Economics for Everyone, and in it he says--.  It&#8217;s a book called Economics for Everyone.  It&#8217;s basically an educational book about the capitalist system and in this chapter he says, &#8220;I am talking about the system we have, which is called capitalism, and yes, it&#8217;s scary when I say that.&#8221; [Laughs] I was like, he's a Canadian, so I was like if the Canadians are afraid to say it then we are really afraid to say it.  So there&#8217;s some kind of psychic thing going on with us that we have to get past.  It&#8217;s like alcoholism. [Laughs] That&#8217;s my new--.  And [57:22] was like we&#8217;re afraid that--.  I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;ll dismantle the system because I do not believe we&#8217;ll dismantle capitalism, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d be for dismantling capitalism, but I am for controlling capitalism.  I was in Slovakia years ago and I don&#8217;t think communism made people happy.  They did have homes and healthcare though.  So I&#8217;m for controlling the system.  I don&#8217;t know why the choice is we have it or we don&#8217;t.  And we know so little about other countries that we don&#8217;t even think--.  We don&#8217;t know about countries that have social democratic systems that also have capitalism.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: I went to Finland.  The farmers get vacations.  They send people to your farm and you get a vacation as a farmer.  Now how sane is that, to let a farmer have a vacation?
JW: [Laughs]
SW: My great aunt and uncle could hardly ever take a vacation because they had milk cows, you know.
JW: Uh huh.
SW: It&#8217;s like, we get a vacation.  The government sends us farmers.  I&#8217;m like, oh, my God.  I was at a workshop in Asheville and they were doing a series of economic workshops in this neighborhood, this little apartment complex, and so there&#8217;s Ukrainians, Latin Americans, African Americans, some white Appalachian people, but not too many, and so it&#8217;s English, Russian, and Spanish [and] we&#8217;re doing this workshop. [Laughs] It&#8217;s fascinating because you have Ukrainians, Latin Americans from several different countries, and then African Americans from mostly western North Carolina and so they were telling stories about their lives and what happened to them and you get this whole picture of the globalization, about what happens to people, and then they&#8217;re all here in this neighborhood, so when they talk about what to do they&#8217;re basically trying to figure out how to make a better neighborhood, which is a good idea, but they have a much larger analysis.  This one woman, she says, &#8220;You know, socialism wasn&#8217;t all bad.&#8221; [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs]

SW: She says, &#8220;You know when I had my baby I got--,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how much time off, with pay.  I said, &#8220;I know.  It&#8217;s not all bad.&#8221; [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs] Right.
SW: We just don&#8217;t know much about it. [Laughs]
JW: Right.  Well and that gets to, I think, who is capitalism really for in this country,--
SW: Right.
JW: --and just the stratification of wealth that we&#8217;ve seen.
SW: Yeah.  And that&#8217;s why this book is so good because he just kind of talks about the system sort of matter-of-fact-ly, and it&#8217;s like we can&#8217;t even talk about the system matter-of-fact-ly because there&#8217;s all these triggers that we--.  It&#8217;s like every time you talk about distribution of wealth they say it&#8217;s class warfare, right?  They just shut it down.  But the gap between the rich and the poor is unbelievable in this country.  They get away with calling it class warfare, the poor people are against the rich people who have all the resources and the power, like [Laughs] how do they get away with that? [Laughs] So, anyway, that&#8217;s my newest like [Growls].  We&#8217;re in denial.  We have to get past our fear.
JW: Well so--.
SW: [Laughs]
JW: So what would you see as the thread through your organizing career, starting with SOCM and then even to where you are now with this bigger analysis you&#8217;re trying to get to?
SW: Well I think the main thread is that I believe that people can organize to do big things, and I do believe that, so that&#8217;s why I want us to organize to do big things, and here&#8217;s a big thing I think we need to do, but maybe it&#8217;s not this but there&#8217;s got to be something bigger we can do.  [1:00:37] working on healthcare, so there&#8217;s lots of big things, but, yeah, so I think that&#8217;s--.  I really believe that it&#8217;s important for people to work together to change things.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: And that--.  Yeah.  And I have a big believe in popular education, which to me--.  So here is something actually that is really true for me that isn&#8217;t necessarily how other people talk.  I believe that popular education and organizing, to have power they&#8217;re done together so that they&#8217;re really the same process if done well.  For example I didn&#8217;t know the term popular education until I came to Highlander.  [Whispers] I was like, what is that?
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: But when I think about I worked at SOCM and what I thought was important, I mean I think SOCM valued having people directly affected come together to decide what to do and our job was to kind of try to help that process happen, so maybe we go get the papers at the office.  Maybe we talk to people individually.  Maybe we help get people together, but the ethic of popular education I think was at play in SOCM, or that&#8217;s what I took from SOCM, so I have a big belief that--.  And that&#8217;s what helps people get to a larger analysis.  If you take the time for people to hear each other and develop analysis that helps you get to bigger analysis.  If you&#8217;re just worrying about what the activity is and who&#8217;s coming that&#8217;s a mobilization, which you have to do, but it&#8217;s not the popular education.  For me I see them as one thing, which isn&#8217;t true for many people, and we just did a workshop last December which was called Popular Education and Organizing and my idea of doing it was trying to smoosh them back together because they&#8217;d been dichotomized in a way that actually isn&#8217;t helpful in either case.  It&#8217;s interesting because I think there&#8217;s movement toward trying to smoosh them back together and I think we just have to smoosh them back together to do better work.
JW: Mm hmm.  So what do you think are the major limitations to achieving that goal?
SW: Which goal?
JW: Of putting--.
SW: Putting them back together?
JW: Yeah, of the popular education and mobilizing occurring as one unit?
SW: Some of it&#8217;s just historical and how it's been dichotomized, although that seems to be more at play with older people than younger people because when we did that workshop the older people were like, &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about organizing.  I want to talk about popular education,&#8221; and the younger people were like, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to talk about that anymore,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t have this division in their head.  It kind of comes from, I think, Alinsky and [Myles] Horton, the division created around them in this country.  That&#8217;s my theory. [Laughs] So I think as actually younger people are more involved then you&#8217;ll actually have less problem with that.  Part of it is just time and that people have sort of--.  People mean different things by their words so part of it is trying to deconstruct what you&#8217;re actually talking about, so I think one of the problems is people see popular education as the tools and methods but not as the purpose.  The purpose to me is helping people come together to share information and analysis and figure out what to do.  That&#8217;s the purpose.  But that&#8217;s the same purpose as organizing, to me.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So the tools and methods--.  So people like that it&#8217;s [more participative,] blah, blah, blah. [Sound of something falling or breaking] Oh!
JW: Uh oh.
SW: And so they get kind of preoccupied with the tools and methods but not the purpose, if that makes sense.
JW: I can pause it for a second.
SW: Yeah, let me--.  [1:03:57] [Break in recording] --and from--. [Pause] I&#8217;m just rattling along.
JW: Oh, it&#8217;s okay.
SW: [1:04:05] rattling on. [1:04:06] like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!  Some people came to this Wacky Work Week thing we did, where we did workshops, and they came from--.  There&#8217;s a group called the National People&#8217;s Action, which has been around a long time, did a lot of work on redlining in banks, and NTIC is their training institute, so people came from there to this Wacky Work Week, which I found fascinating, because they&#8217;re kind of from the Alinsky line, the kind of Midwestern Alinsky line, and they want to bring their leadership back.  We had a really interesting conversation.  They&#8217;ve transferred actually in terms of the founders so it&#8217;s new people who aren&#8217;t young but they&#8217;re new people, and they came to Highlander I think to try and figure if there&#8217;s something that would be helpful to them, so they&#8217;re interested in the popular education part of what we do, which I find fascinating, so they&#8217;re going to probably come back in December and we&#8217;ll help them in some way figure out what they want to do.  But we had a really interesting conversation because they do a leadership training and this woman was saying, &#8220;Yeah, the most important thing is when people tell their stories the first night.  It&#8217;s really amazing what happens.&#8221;  I&#8217;m like, [Whispers] that&#8217;s popular education.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I think part of it is just deconstructing people&#8217;s views of it and just saying what is it we&#8217;re trying to do and what is important to do, and so relationship building, people sharing stories, people&#8217;s connections to each other are really important and they&#8217;re important over time, so it&#8217;s probably also what--.  It somewhat holds people together.  It&#8217;s kind of the--.  [Chela], the same woman, she talks about this factor, Factor C, she called it.  She said some person in Chile talked about this.  She said it&#8217;s like--it was translated from Spanish so I can&#8217;t exactly say but I haven&#8217;t been able to find whoever supposedly wrote about this, but she said it&#8217;s like the things about cooperation and communication and collaboration, and it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s what the glue is.  It&#8217;s what the glue is.  So popular education to me helps provide the glue that will hold people together and help people figure out where they need to go.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: This other woman from Chicago came to the social change workshop we did, Popular Education and Organizing, and she is in Chicago and she wants us to come up and do a popular education and organizing up there, and she works with a lot of senior citizens who were trying kind of an Alinsky organizing, so I think that&#8217;d be fascinating. [Laughs]
JW: And what do you think the relationship is of popular education with getting women and people of color and immigrants and minority populations involved?  Do you think there&#8217;s something important about the popular education?
SW: Oh yeah, because it tries to equalize voices so the fact of trying to have people all be able to participate I think is important, because that&#8217;s not people&#8217;s experience, actually hardly anybody, and trying to deal with power relationships, so not letting racism--.  I mean now we do these ground rules to try to help set a space, which I think all that helps, and you know, like the domestic violence.  I was reading a book about the history of that and it started around these kitchen table conversations, and it&#8217;s very interesting, and that&#8217;s mostly lost, that history, I think.  I was reading it because this group was coming from Texas and wanted to have organizing again in that work and so I read this book that Suzanne told me about and it describes, you know, women can--.  Like this issue was not named.  It was totally present but not named and so women started talking to each other over the kitchen tables and they realized it wasn&#8217;t just them.  It was so much more common than they thought and that&#8217;s what led to the domestic violence movement, and probably also fed the women&#8217;s movement, I bet.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Because Suzanne was involved in both and they were kind of parallel tracks.  But that&#8217;s popular education, and it&#8217;s kind of what people do on their own if they&#8217;re not swayed by hierarchical systems.  If we live next door to a toxic waste dump and you and I start talking, what are we going to do?  We don&#8217;t know anything about toxic waste dumps.  What are we going to do?  That can lead to a popular education process, and often does, without people knowing the words.  When we worked on stuff in SOCM like, well, the National Guard: What do we do?  NAFTA: What do we do?  Plant closings: What do we do?  It was a popular education process that helped us think strategically, which included other--.  It wasn&#8217;t that people with expertise weren&#8217;t included because they were a lot, but the people with the most expertise were actually causing the problem so they weren&#8217;t going to help you. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.
SW:  So I think that&#8217;s probably true for the community and environmental stuff that would be called environmental justice now, that a lot of that was built off of people sharing stories and analysis with each other and to me that&#8217;s a popular education of the process.  To me in some ways having two words isn&#8217;t good.  I mean two words isn&#8217;t really a good idea.  So we try to take the spiral--.  There&#8217;s a spiral that&#8217;s in this book, Educating for a Change, a popular education spiral, and we took it, because I said really that&#8217;s what happens in organizing too.  You get together, you talk about what&#8217;s happening, try to figure out what to do, you go away, you come back, it&#8217;s like, what happened, da, da, da, da, da.  It&#8217;s the same thing in a way but more localized and directed, and so we tried to take it and both cast it as organizing and education when we shared it with this group, [Laughs] which was kind of funny.  Some people had a really hard time with it; other people were like, oh, yeah, that&#8217;s great.  That&#8217;s fine. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.  So what has it meant to you personally to be involved in social justice campaigns over the past couple of decades?
SW: Well I&#8217;ve been really--.  How lucky could I be, to work on things I care about and somebody pay me?  I didn&#8217;t know you could do that, [Laughs] so I feel like I&#8217;ve been tremendously privileged to have people let me in their lives and work on things I cared about and get paid for it, because maybe I would have worked on them anyway but getting paid is a big privilege.  And I&#8217;ve learned so much from people because I've spent so much time.  I've learned so much from people and I learn stuff all the time, so it&#8217;s like I get an education all the time and I don&#8217;t have to go to school, [Laughs] which is fine with me.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I just feel like I&#8217;ve been really lucky, and I always worried about what I was going to be which maybe in some ways might have been good because I wouldn&#8217;t have known to be this, and so the fact that I never could figure it out let me agree to things that--.  When I was leaving SOCM I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d come to work at Highlander.  It never would have crossed my mind, but there was this one program that was really a good fit for me, so I just feel like I&#8217;ve been amazingly--.  Yeah, I&#8217;ve been really, really, really lucky.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: [And somebody said,] &#8220;It&#8217;s not luck.&#8221;  I was like, well I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s luck or not.  [Laughs] Maybe it&#8217;s not luck, I don&#8217;t know.  It seems like luck to me. [Laughs]
JW: Uh huh.
SW: If I was Christian I guess I would say God but I&#8217;m not really Christian, so. [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: Maybe some greater thing was helping me.  I don&#8217;t know.  I think I was lucky, because I could have had a whole different path.  I could have found some other job.  I could have worked for the division of water quality and been the person that the SOCM people came to. [Laughs] It&#8217;s like, &#8220;What about this permit?  Blah, blah, blah, blah.&#8221; I could have been them. [Laughs]  And I don&#8217;t know how long I would have been them, you know.  That&#8217;s kind of an interesting thing to me because the other thing that&#8217;s true is I&#8217;m a scanner by personality.  I&#8217;m a generalist and so I found a job where that&#8217;s actually very useful, so for me that was lucky because I kept feeling like, oh, this doesn&#8217;t fit, oh, this doesn&#8217;t fit, because no one had a way to help me understand that.  But when I think about it, I like knowing a lot about a lot of things and changing what I do, and so this is a really great way for me to do that.  So it suits me, you know.
JW: Mm hmm.  Well would you like to add any concluding thoughts or are their any questions that I didn&#8217;t ask you that you expected and you would like to address?
SW: No, but I&#8217;m really interested in the overall look at southern Appalachia, because I was at SOCM for ten years and mostly was on the Cumberland Plateau, part of the Appalachian [1:12:22] Coalition, but I always feel like I didn&#8217;t know enough about what--.  Sort of taking a bigger look at it is really helpful to do, so I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re doing that.  And it&#8217;s good for Highlander because Highlander had a lot of work during that period with a lot of people.
JW: Well and since you mention it--.
SW: Do you want some suggestions of other people to talk to?  [Or you should tell me who you&#8217;re talking to], or if you--.  You may not--.
JW: I absolu--.
SW: I mean you have five years to do this, so. [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs] Well I do want suggestions because you do know a lot of people, but I guess first since you brought up southern Appalachia, what was your understanding of your relationship to southern Appalachia?  Did you sense that there was a movement, that there was something happening here?  I talked to Helen Lewis and she said things were hot in the &#8217;70s in southern Appalachia.
SW: Well I was late because I came to SOCM in &#8217;79 so I had the sense there had been a movement.  Some of the organizations [we were] part of sort of came out of that, like the anti-strip mining movement, but I wasn&#8217;t really part of it during that time, so I had the sense of it but not--.  I had the sense of a lot--.  I mean there were a lot of people doing stuff and that came out of the--not only the anti-strip mining but also black lung, so there was a lot of stuff.  I was kind of more on the--.  Mostly I was up on the Cumberland Plateau so I didn&#8217;t go out much so I didn&#8217;t--.  My job was very local with these communities and that&#8217;s how I thought about my job.  It actually wasn&#8217;t until I came to Highlander that people used this word &#8220;movement&#8221; all the time.  I mean they talked about the anti-strip mining movement.  That was clear to me.  People sat down and they tried to ban strip mining and you could sort of see in how people talked about it that that meant something to people.  When I came to Highlander people kept talking about movements and I&#8217;m like, [Whispers] what are they talking about?  I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about.  [Resumes normal tone] And that&#8217;s another word that means lots of things to different people, so some people use it as if there&#8217;s a movement all the time, which is not true.  I do not believe it.  So I believe people are doing stuff all the time and sometimes it adds up to a movement, but that stuff is always happening so that&#8217;s--.  Like I feel like with the NAFTA stuff it felt kind of like a movement, like what I think a movement would feel like, for a short period of time, kind of leading up to Seattle.  I mean that felt like a movement somehow, because it&#8217;s like more people coming out of the woodwork than you ever could have imagined.  So that&#8217;s always been kind of an interesting--.  When I came here I was like, could somebody define a movement, because I was like, [Whispers] I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about.  [Resumes normal tone] Because I&#8217;d go to meetings and people would be like, oh, the labor movement.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a movement.  I think there&#8217;s a lot of labor groups [Whispers] but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a movement.  I don&#8217;t.  [Resumes normal tone] So that&#8217;s another word that I think is--.  It means different things, and to me it means when a lot of people are looking the same way.  We could have had a movement around this economic meltdown but we haven&#8217;t had one yet, and maybe we will.  I mean in the Depression it took several years for stuff to coalesce so I&#8217;m hoping that that&#8217;s true.  But, yeah, I think I felt little movements but not big movements.  The whole environmental kind of spiraling out in the communities, [fighting environment], that felt like a movement to me.
JW: Uh huh.
SW: So I think of it kind of in smaller ways than bigger ways but I feel like stuff&#8217;s always happening and stuff can feed a movement, so that&#8217;s why the larger analysis.  It&#8217;s like how do you help people look the same way, and then it could become a movement.  If people aren&#8217;t looking the same way then you can&#8217;t have a movement.  So what can people look at that&#8217;s--.  How can people look the same way?  That&#8217;s what Suzanne used to say it.  I was like, that&#8217;s kind of a good way to talk about it.  They&#8217;re not all doing the same thing but they&#8217;re all looking the same way.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: And we&#8217;re all looking different ways, so we have to have some way to look the same way.
JW: So did you have a similar--?  I mean you were in--.
SW: Mostly I was just trying to do my job, which I was trying to figure out what my job was. [Laughs]
JW: Right.  Well, so--.
SW: [Melody] and I would kind of wander around like, what should we do today? [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs] Well--.
SW: We had some funny moments wondering what we were supposed to be doing.  We&#8217;re supposed to be fighting strip mines.  Do you know anything--?  Think about this.  I&#8217;m--what?--twenty-three, when I go, twenty-four, when I went to work, so [Melody&#8217;s] probably twenty-three.  We end up living in [Piney].  We work a lot together with Lucille.  The three of us know the least about what we&#8217;re supposed to do.  We&#8217;re supposed to organize the southern coal fields.  So there were some strip mine permits that would come up so we would try to figure out what to do about those and then we would get a strip mine permit and just go to these neighborhoods and start knocking on doors.  I mean [Laughs] when I about like here we were, young, not from the place, because I always feel like I wasn&#8217;t from Appalachia because I was from Oak Ridge and people in Oak Ridge are from everywhere, so my father was from North Carolina and my mother was from Pittsburgh, and there was this big thing about you&#8217;re from here or you&#8217;re not.  So that whole thing is another interesting thing I think about who is really from--.  Like a lot of people have come and gone.  People moved in--.  I worked with people--.  People moved in, people had come and gone, people [who had lived] in the same place all the time, but there was this kind of romantic notion of the community people, which I think was not very--didn&#8217;t really reflect in fact, the mixture of people that got involved in stuff, maybe because--.  Yeah.  So you know sometimes I think it&#8217;s--. [Laughs] It&#8217;s sort of like how Highlander started by these two guys in their twenties and how did it ever last seventy-five years.  It&#8217;s like what did I think I was doing and what did people think when I would knock on their door?  What did they think? [Laughs]
JW: Yeah.
SW: So when I think [1:17:51] it&#8217;s sort of funny to me.  I just was doing what they told me to do and it didn&#8217;t strike me as so odd or unlikely and that&#8217;s why I think younger people are good because they&#8217;re braver.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: I was braver in my twenties and thirties than I am now, and that was good.  It&#8217;s good that I worked for SOCM and for TIRN then.  That&#8217;s when people should do this because they are braver and they don&#8217;t think so much about how weird is it that some twenty-three year old is knocking on doors of people [Laughs] [1:18:14]
JW: Well so did you have a period where you were learning what it meant to be in southern Appalachia or what that--?  Because I know Helen Lewis, she was behind the Appalachian Studies--
SW: Yeah.
JW: --at, you know.
SW: Well the first thing I did with SOCM is I came to help do the land ownership study so that was out of the Appalachian Alliance so I had a sense that we were part of this regional thing that I learned about by being part of that in a way, so it gave me kind of a regional view about who the groups were and so I guess maybe because I came in then that did give me some context that was bigger than local that was helpful.  That&#8217;s one thing that was helpful for me is like, oh, there&#8217;s these people around and they have this alliance because of this flooding and this mining, so that did kind of give me a context for [when I was locally], but, yeah.  And I went to Appalachian Alliance meetings and Appalachian Coalition meetings and those were both southern Appalachian things, and that was good I think.  I mean that&#8217;s one thing I think is kind of missing is where do people gather now, because CORA was sort of the last thing and CORA&#8217;s not around anymore.  CORA was the last place where people from Appalachia had a regular gathering.  Now it&#8217;s Appalachian Studies which isn&#8217;t the same.  It&#8217;s got this funny dynamic between academics and the community people and some people want to be more academic, some [1:19:35] people, and I guess they struggle every year and whoever plans it does more or less of that,--
JW: Right.
SW: --but it&#8217;s not the same thing as going to like an Appalachian Alliance meeting.  So I think that that&#8217;s one of those places where it really helped me that I went sometimes to places where I&#8217;d learn things, and some things I learned, like I remember somebody came and talked about Shell Oil in South Africa to one of these Appalachian Coalition meetings and I started boycotting Shell Oil.  I&#8217;m like, yeah, I&#8217;m not going to buy Shell Oil, and I still don&#8217;t buy Shell Oil. [Laughs] And coming to Highlander workshops, those were all ways in which I got some pieces of stuff that helped me develop relationships, know people to call, get a context, and that there was more relationships really between people, I think, then.  Probably people don&#8217;t gather as much now, I mean really now, because of the economy, and so how do people--?  And e-mail and websites don&#8217;t substitute, so I do have a--.  This does relate to popular education and organizing, like how does new technology help us and where do we think it&#8217;s taking care of something that it&#8217;s not taking care of, and I think the relationship building and the strategizing where you really have to dig in are places where it doesn&#8217;t help us.  I think it does help us in other ways.  I feel like one need is for us to really analyze what are we trying to do and what helps us get there, and not just have the conversation this is good or bad, because you sort of have older and younger people like, &#8220;We need more of this.  We don&#8217;t need--.&#8221;  I just want to talk about [1:21:10] and what do you need to do? [Laughs]
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: So I think that in some ways the technology actually, we hoped it would substitute for things that then we&#8217;d let go of and it doesn&#8217;t really substitute for them, and I think the relationship building is really that, because when this economic stuff was happening last fall I started looking online for stuff.  Well I really should have just called people I knew that did economic work, which I know from lots of time working with people.  I should have just gotten on the phone, and why don&#8217;t I learn that?  I kept looking on the Web or waiting for e-mails to come my way.  I should have gotten on the phone.  Now that I&#8217;ve gotten on the phone it is much more helpful.
JW: Mm hmm.
SW: [Laughs] So I think there are some really good questions in terms of transferring it generationally in this region.  We just did the STAY project at Highlander, and this was so interesting.  These young people who--.  They called it STAY because they were like [1:22:05] The media project was, and this youth program we did at Appalachian Studies, [Alandria] and Rebecca did in Huntington.  Were you there?  Do you go to the Appalachian Studies?  Anyway they did a youth gathering and [people were like] we have a voice but really we want to be able to stay.  Just having our voice is not enough.  So we started this STAY project and these young people planned it and facilitated it.  [Alandria] and Rebecca were not in the planning group and they [are trying to start networking].  I was like how do you give people space that are younger to come up with new ideas and try new things, because a lot of people doing stuff now, they were young and they did stuff.  So I think for southern Appalachia and for this whole region how people really--how we start thinking about work is it&#8217;s ongoing work and you always need new people and you always need to transfer skills.  I think SOCM was good that way when I worked there.  It was really about skill sharing, about bringing in new people and that was always the ethic of it, and so I think that that is important to build in more as an ethic for how we do our work.  It gets cast as intergenerational work but really it&#8217;s about what is a way we&#8217;re always bringing people in and helping people learn things and sharing skills and learning from them, that that&#8217;s a--.  I think there&#8217;s a particular time when we really need to do that here but I think an ethic like that helps you just have a system that works better and that that&#8217;s really important.  I was twenty-four and I was given a chance to do a lot of stuff and nobody said, "You're young.&#8221;  Nobody said you were a youth.  So we now have created this youth category that&#8217;s very weird.  I was clearly inexperienced.  I did not know what I was doing and I had no training but I wasn&#8217;t dismissed as young because everybody else was younger, so there is this whole weird dynamic going on in this region that I think is not useful, so it will be interesting because we&#8217;re part of this older bunch of people, the Central Appalachian Regional Network, and then we have the Stay project and both groups are wanting to do some kind of policy summit so that will be interesting to see will the older people be willing to let these young people really have part of it and help plan it, because it will be much better if they do.
JW: Yeah.  Okay.
