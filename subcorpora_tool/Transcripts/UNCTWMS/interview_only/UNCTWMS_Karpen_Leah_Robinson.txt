Daphne Fruchtman: OK, well, this is Daphne Fruchtman and I&#8217;m here on March 21, 2012 with Leah Karpen in her home in Asheville, North Carolina. Today we&#8217;ll be discussing her career and role as a Jewish woman activist in North Carolina and New York and just her general life story. And I thought a good place to start would just be with your childhood-just tell me a little bit about growing up in Asheville. What was it like here?  Leah Karpen: Well, Asheville was quite different in those days. There wasn&#8217;t much going on here. I was born probably at Mission Hospital in Asheville, and I lived on Broad Street, which is off of Charlotte Street. I don&#8217;t remember anything about those early years. What I remember is when we moved to Forrest Hill Drive. My family had a house at 108 Forrest Hill Drive, a big white house, and we were six children so they had to add onto the house (laughter). Built a two-car garage with a maid&#8217;s room and two big bedrooms so that we were very comfortable. My father was an optometrist. We always had food on the table but we weren&#8217;t affluent. And, you know, you wore clothes handed down from the older ones. But I went to school at Newton School on Biltmore Avenue which was torn down and made into a parking lot-makes me very unhappy. In school I was-maybe the other kids were dumb but I was too smart for the class, so they kept moving me ahead. And they moved me up to when I graduated I wasn&#8217;t quite fifteen years old. I won spelling bees, I remember that. I don&#8217;t remember a lot about my classes. It was during the depression in the 30s. We didn&#8217;t have music or art in our classes. I do remember sewing class, because it was the only thing I ever made a C on. And I can understand that, I&#8217;m still not good at sewing (laughter). So I don&#8217;t remember an awful lot about school. We had playmates and friends in the neighborhood. There was a girl named Peggy Brown, lived next door. Kenilworth was a nice, quiet area. It was only a couple blocks from Biltmore Avenue so we could get the bus, or we could walk to downtown, which we did quite a lot. I went to David Miller Junior High School, which was seventh and eighth grade. At that time there were only eleven grades in our school, not twelve. So, junior high wasn&#8217;t terribly exciting. It was the kind of teaching where you had a science course and you memorized everything. Things weren&#8217;t explained. The teachers really weren&#8217;t good. I had a civics teacher that was good. I think I was always interested in civics after that for some reason. I had an English teacher, I still remember her name-Mrs. Stevenson-which I definitely remembered. Then for high school, I&#8217;m trying to remember. I guess the new high school was built by then on McDowell Street. It was called Lee Edwards High, they named it for our principle. I think that was after he died they named it for him. Later on they changed the name back to Asheville High because of the race movement in Asheville and he was a white person. It&#8217;s kind of hard to understand. I did go to my class reunion-was it my fiftieth or whatever? Yeah, I think so. My sister, who was two years ahead of me, went to the same reunion because there weren&#8217;t that many people who graduated in the 1930s. So I graduated high school in 1935. It&#8217;s not a really interesting story because it wasn&#8217;t an interesting life. It was just ordinary. But we had a big yard on Forrest Hill Drive and there were woods behind us and we used to go walking a lot in Kenilworth. So, everything was fine. We didn&#8217;t have any major problems.   DF: Can you tell me a little bit about the Jewish community here during the time? I mean, was there much of one? Were you involved?  LK: There was a Jewish community. There was an orthodox congregation and there was the reform congregation. We belonged to the reform Jewish congregation and I still do. The synagogue was on Spruce Street. It doesn&#8217;t exist anymore. It was opposite with the Thomas Wolfe house is now. It had a loft where the cantor, singer, would be, and the organ. We had some interesting Rabbis. There was a Rabbi Jacobson, who was a wonderful person. His family eventually moved out west and I knew about them for a few years. My brother was much better on keeping up with that kind of history than I am. I was one of six children and I&#8217;m the only one surviving and I don&#8217;t know why. Because I&#8217;m 91 years old, and nobody in my family lived that long. And I can&#8217;t explain it. So what I&#8217;m telling you isn&#8217;t terribly exciting, I know. I went-we didn&#8217;t have-I don&#8217;t know what you know about the Jewish people, anyway, but boys had Bar Mitzvah at age 13. Girls did not, so I was confirmed. Now girls have Bat Mitzvah and some people my age have done that, but I didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not a Jewish scholar. But, we always attended Friday night services. We didn&#8217;t have Saturday morning services. If there was a Bar Mitzvah it would be on Friday night. I have three brothers that were all Bar Mitzvahed. In fact we were three boys and three girls, so we had our own play group. So, what can I tell you about the Jewish community? We had a big house on-I&#8217;m not sure if it was on Munford Avenue, but that history is in the archives at Asheville, the history of our congregation, Beth Ha-Tefila. If you wanted to really research it, it&#8217;s the special collections at University of North Carolina. In the library they have papers, but I&#8217;m not really going to go into the history of the congregation, because that&#8217;s not what you really want to hear from me.  DF: Sure. Can I ask why was your brother-you said that your brother really kept up with the history of the synagogue-  LK: Well, that&#8217;s just the way he was. He kept-he remembered things I didn&#8217;t remember-  DF: OK, I just didn&#8217;t know if he had some reason-  LK: All right, this brother is the one who became a Rabbi. Rabbi Michael Robinson. He died at least four years ago, maybe five. And he and I were very close. There was another brother in between us, but he and I were always very close.   DF: Well let me move onto your college years. Did you stay in the area to go to school?  LK: Well, I went to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, because in those days they didn&#8217;t admit girls to Chapel Hill until their junior year unless they were studying pharmacy. In retrospect I wish I had studied pharmacy, it would have given me a profession. But, I wasn&#8217;t interested in it at the time. So, it was a girl&#8217;s school. [phone ringing] Let me just get that.   [recorder turned off and then back on]  DF: So we were talking about UNC Greensboro.  LK: OK. You wondered if my activism started then and I would say no, absolutely not. I was not an activist then. I don&#8217;t remember that I belonged to any clubs or anything like that. There&#8217;s nothing special about that place.   DF: How did you feel about going to a woman&#8217;s school? Did you enjoy that aspect of it or not?  LK: I couldn&#8217;t wait to get to Chapel Hill. [laughter]   DF: OK, OK.   LK: That really wasn&#8217;t where I wanted to be. And of course I was too young to have dates anyway. I&#8217;d never had a date, so-of course I didn&#8217;t have any social life. But-I didn&#8217;t feel that that was where I wanted to be.  DF: And you said that you wished you&#8217;d gone into pharmacy school-what did you major in?  LK: Well, I thought of that later on. I majored in Chemistry-was my father&#8217;s suggestion. What he didn&#8217;t realize that the chemical industry was just taking off in those years-so it&#8217;s between 1935 and 1939 when I graduated. So it was really just the beginning of the chemical industry. But I graduated with a B.S. in chemistry and in 1939 a woman couldn&#8217;t get a job in the industry. Another woman who was in my class, she took the B.A. degree, which wasn&#8217;t as difficult. She got a job with some chemical firm, but I did not. So I came back to Asheville and took a brush up course on shorthand and typing and I got a job with Ecusta Paper Company, which had just started at Pisgah Forest. Pisgah Forest is just outside of Brevard. The Davidson River runs through it and the river was used in the manufacturing of cigarette paper. Of course, we didn&#8217;t know then that cigarettes were harmful and it was a bad thing to be in. But, that&#8217;s what I was doing. So, at Chapel Hill I became more active in what was going on. I was on the staff of the yearbook one year I think. And I belonged-there was some kind of a science club that I headed. I don&#8217;t remember too much about it. You&#8217;ve got to remember this was a long time ago.  DF: [laughter] I know, I know. We&#8217;re stretching back. Well, let me-  LK: So this is not really the interesting part.  DF: OK, well if you had to pick a moment where you thought, you know, this is when you really jumped into activism or maybe the first movement that you were involved with. When would that have occurred?  LK: Well, during the Vietnam War my brother, who was always an activist, was opposed to the war, and he&#8217;s the first one that really got me interested in being an activist. I&#8217;d say he was a big influence on me-on a lot of people, to tell you the truth.  DF: And which brother was this?  LK: That&#8217;s Michael Robinson. My maiden name was Robinson. But, that wasn&#8217;t all. In 1943, I guess, I&#8217;m just trying to think. OK, here I am working for Ecusta Paper Corporation, OK. In 1943 we were in a war-World War II-and I wanted to do something for the war effort. So, I took some kind of a course and passed the civil service exam, but the job I got had nothing to do with that. I got a job in Vallejo, California, working for the Navy. And we were doing Radar installation on ships, and I don&#8217;t want to go into that, but that is-why is that interesting? Because I met my husband out in Vallejo. I met him in 42 or-let me think-I met him in 43 or 44. So, at the end of the war he was discharged and he took discharge at a base in North Carolina. At that point, I had come home. The war was over and my job was over. So, we moved then to New York, which was his home. And, you know, people would say where did you meet your husband? Met him in California. What were you doing in California? [laughter] So, it&#8217;s hard to remember all this and tell it all and try to get it in the right sequence. So, we lived in New York City in an apartment in a building that had been renovated. It was after the war and there was not good housing, but he knew a builder-he was in the building trades-and so he got us this apartment. And, I found a job, I went to work on the subway. This was not my lifestyle. I was very unhappy in New York. We had a couple of friends there, but I finally said to him I&#8217;m not going to stay here. Either get me out of here or I&#8217;m going to North Carolina. So, he found some land in West Hempstead and he build and had built a house for us in West Hempstead, Long Island. And that was really the beginning of a completely different life. And I&#8217;ve lived in this area since 1977 and it seems so far off now that we were in New York, you know? But that was a big, important part of my life at that time. So, what happened there was I got involved with the League of Women Voters. And I have a habit of saying that everything I know I learned from the League of Women Voters. I joined the foreign policy group because I knew nothing about foreign policy. From the League I learned speaking, leading discussions, getting involved in the community, running candidates&#8217; meetings, all those things the League does. So, that was really an important part of my life. But that was even after we left West Hempstead. In West Hempstead, I was mildly active in Hadassah. But, not in the League of Women Voters. After that we moved in 1948 or so, we moved to Lloyd Harbor, which is just outside of Huntington, Long Island, just north of Huntington. And that&#8217;s when I got involved with the League of Women Voters.  DF: Would you mind explaining what exactly is Hadassah?   LK: It&#8217;s a women&#8217;s Zionist organization which supports Israel. And they provide-they have a hospital in Israel-Hadassah Hospital, very well known, it&#8217;s a wonderful hospital. And the group raises money for Hadassah Hospital and that kind of thing.  DF: When you moved-I don&#8217;t want to jump ahead suddenly to when you came back to North Carolina.  LK: That&#8217;s OK, that&#8217;s OK.   DF:  But I am interested--the connections that you made and sort of the activist channels, the groups that you were involved in when you were in New York City, did those connections-did you maintain them when you came back to North Carolina, or did those two periods of your life separate?  LK: Well not really. When I came back to North Carolina, 1977, the people that I knew before hadn&#8217;t grown. They&#8217;d stayed the same and I was not the same person and they were not my best friends anymore. I had to make an entirely new circle of friends. But, I&#8217;m trying to think-it&#8217;s hard now to separate Long Island from Asheville. [laughter] To figure out just where I became active and what I was doing there. I may have to back up as I remember it.   DF: That&#8217;s fine, I mean, you don&#8217;t have to worry about going in order.  LK: OK, go ahead.  DF: Let me ask you-I read and I don&#8217;t know if this was correct or not since it was from the internet [laughter-interviewer and interviewee joked before interview about how you can&#8217;t believe everything you read on the internet], but I read about you made a trip to Soviet Union at some point. Could you talk to me a little bit about that? Like, how did that trip come to be?  LK: OK, this is when we were living in Huntington.  My husband and I liked to travel, so the first overseas trip we ever took was not to Europe-everyone goes to Europe-so we decided to go to the Soviet Union and we went with an Audubon group. Two of my boys were off on science-some kind of science projects connected with the college. Anyway, my brother came down. He was going to live in my house with whoever was left-my daughter I guess. I had four children by then. So what happened? He ended up with all the children [laughter]. It was really interesting visitng the Soviet Union because, as I said, we had never been outside the United States. So, he&#8217;d be standing in line somewhere, &#8220;oh, American, American!&#8221; they were so interested. So, it was a great trip.  DF: How long were you over there?  LK: I think it was about two weeks. Most of my trips-we were never gone more than two weeks, I didn&#8217;t like to do that.  DF: OK. Now, your father was from Russia. Is that correct?  LK: Well, he was from a part of Russia that may have become Poland. But, he had no fond memories of Russia. He hated the Cossacks. And, he never really talked about his life in Russia. [Large bee buzzed around us] There&#8217;s a huge bug has been flying-they&#8217;re carpenter bees.  DF: OK. So there was, I guess this trip to Russia there was no connection go back to find family. None of that happened.  LK: There was no connection. There was no family there. First of all my grandfather came to Galveston, Texas. And then when my father was nine or ten years old he came over. They lived in Galveston first. So my father graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. He then-he was working in the oil fields and he said this is no kind of a life for a guy who wants to get married, so he took up optometry. He was very bright, I think he did the whole thing in record time. He was excellent at what he did. He could get anybody&#8217;s eyes fixed. He really knew what he was doing.  DF: Was he involved in any sort of community activism?  LK: Yes, he was. He used to write letters to the editor. We still have lots of copies. He was on the metropolitan planning board. He-it&#8217;s interesting, he belonged to the engineers&#8217; society because of his background as an engineer, he kept that up. He would-I think he was an officer of our congregation, but he never became president and that really hurt him. And the people of the congregation didn&#8217;t patronize him for their eyeglasses.  DF: Really!  LK: And that really hurt him, too. That hurt him, too.  DF: Do you know why?  LK: They don&#8217;t like a person that speaks out [laughter]. And that&#8217;s my problem, too, but I get away with it.  DF: That&#8217;s interesting because, at least the general stereotype, lets say-and I have no idea how true it is-but I&#8217;ve heard people say that they think that members of Jewish communities tend to be more active than members of other communities, just as a whole. I take it you didn&#8217;t find that to be the case at all, it sounds like, at least-  LK: Well it may have been true, I just didn&#8217;t know about it. I don&#8217;t know. Well, my father was an avid hiker and he knew all the mountains. We&#8217;d be out and he would know the names of all the mountains. But he didn&#8217;t like the hiking club, he said it was too easy, so he started his own hiking club, the Wilderness Hikers. So, we went with him.  And he had his own little membership cards and everything [laughter]. So, he got us all hiking, every one of us.  DF: Let me ask you about-back to your time in New York City and Long Island. How was it for you as you raised a family and kept your involvement up or began your involvement in organizations. I mean, how did you negotiate those two aspects of your life?   LK: Well, I guess I wasn&#8217;t so involved in organizations that is took too much of my time, is the only thing I can say. I mean, everybody has something they do, and I wasn&#8217;t out playing bridge or playing golf so, I guess I was out going to meetings or whatever.  DF: OK. So you didn&#8217;t find-there wasn&#8217;t much of a tension there or a tension outside of any normal person having their activities outside of their family life do you think?  LK: At that time, there was no conflict. I really didn&#8217;t get very, very active until the children were grown. At one point we lived in Weaverville, and we moved into Asheville here. And my husband used to tell people that we moved here so I could go to my meetings more easily, which absolutely was untrue, because of his health. But that&#8217;s what he said, and I let it go.   DF: So I guess by the time that your children were grown would that have been like the late 1960s or the early 1970s?  LK: No, that&#8217;s earlier. The first one was born in 1948, and the twins were born in 1950. My daughter was born in 1953.   DF: So, did most of your heaviest involvement in activism happen when you were back in Asheville then, is that more or less correct? Or were you becoming more involved before you left Long Island?  LK: You know, it&#8217;s really funny how my Long Island life has become hazy in my mind. So maybe as we talk it will come back to me. I remember the women that got me involved in the League of Women Voters, she lived across the street from me in Huntington. Actually, in Lloyd Harbor is where we lived. Mostly my activism there was with the League of Women Voters, I think. I&#8217;m trying to remember. How I&#8217;d get involved in nuclear issues is just not coming into my frame of reference right now, so this is going to be a disastrous interview [laughter].  DF: That&#8217;s fine, no, no, no! Well just, can you tell me a little bit-I mean you touched earlier on the activities you were involved in with the League of Women Voters.  LK: Well, we did candidate forums where we introduced the candidates in a non-partisan way. I guess we held other meetings, it&#8217;s just-everything that we did on Long Island is just kind of like a blur right now.  DF: What about when you got back to Asheville. Can you-what do you recall was maybe the first organization or-  LK: OK, that won&#8217;t be hard to tell you. We were looking for property to build in western North Carolina and we looked around Asheville, we looked around Marshall, and couldn&#8217;t find anything that really suited us. We thought that if we buy this piece of property we don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re going to develop around it. So, my brother found property in Weaverville for us. It was on Ox Creek Road. So my husband had this house built. He had plans drawn and he kind of revised them. It was a two-story house. It was 1,900 square feet, three bedrooms, and two and a half baths, and we entertained a lot of people here. At this point, our children were all gone, it was just the two of us. So, I think that really made a big difference in what we did with our lives. So, the first thing I remember, and I think probably I&#8217;m starting with Weaverville. The chair of the library board came up and asked if I&#8217;d be on the board-she came up to my house. I said yeah, I guess I could do that. So we kept talking and she said, by the way, would you mind chairing the board. Oh, well ok if you want me to do that.  So what I found out was the library board was in the middle of a building project and architects had drawn plans which were going to cost over 400,000 dollars. Now in today&#8217;s money that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but this was Weaverville. And we had a piece of land, so I started thinking about it and I said, we can&#8217;t raise that kind of money. So, the Baptist Church had moved on the same side of the street to a new building, and had these gorgeous stained glass windows. And at that point they had collected enough money, we bought this church building for 35,000 dollars. The story really starts getting interesting at that point because not only was I chair of the library board, but I was chair of fundraising and anything else that had to happen. So, we needed like 90,000 dollars, something like that, to renovate the building to a library. One of the main things we did we had an auction and everybody donated things. There were two quilts donated I remember I got one them, but it got stolen from me later. And we still needed money, so I went to the Farmers Home Administration, I think that&#8217;s where I got the 90,000 dollar figure, and borrowed that. And I had to sign numerous papers, and I was always going back and forth, back and forth, getting those papers signed and made sure this thing happened.  And I really felt that was the best thing I ever did getting Weaverville a library. So now, instead of being in a dry cleaning store over here on the other side of the street from the Baptist Church, you wouldn&#8217;t believe how the circulation went up. It was what the community needed. And the county wouldn&#8217;t give us any money. They may have given us 25,000 dollars, but that was very little. Twenty years later the county spent I think two million dollars on renovating the building, making it over, and it&#8217;s a beautiful building now. I wouldn&#8217;t let them get rid of those stained glass panels. We had them framed and they&#8217;re hung in the library. You know, they were done in memory of somebody, but I really felt they were pieces of art that belonged to that library. So originally it was two stories, but when they remodeled it they made it one floor, with a basement. I mean, there was a lot of money put into it in the remodeling. So, that library still stands and it&#8217;s flourishing and that was my first contribution, the first thing I thought that I did. So, how did it happen that this woman found me? Well, before this we had started a Great Decisions discussion group. This was sponsored by the Foreign Policy Association. And we used to meet in the old library for these discussions. So, somehow or other somebody saw leadership material in me and said, hey, we need to do something about this. So, that&#8217;s kind of where it got started. I wasn&#8217;t active in the League of Women voters at first-oh excuse me, what I want to do-you want to turn that off.   [recording stopped and started again-Leah Karpen went to get files pertinent to her community activities]  LK: That&#8217;s when I got a job because I couldn&#8217;t go to graduate school. My family couldn&#8217;t afford to send me to graduate school. When I went to the University of North Carolina the tuition was so low you wouldn&#8217;t believe it. And I lived on campus.  DF: Would you mind for this recording just reading that last-what you just read about graduate school, just so I get it on tape, because that was a very powerful statement.  LK: I was the only woman in the organic chemistry class. Physical chemistry was with Dr. Otto Rice, who recommended me for a scholarship at a university in Pullman, Washington. I didn&#8217;t get it, as they explained in a letter, because I was Jewish and a woman. It was years later that I realized the significance of this discrimination. Since I couldn&#8217;t financially attend graduate school, my first concern was to get a job. I took refresher courses in typing and shorthand and was hired as a secretary in the physical testing laboratory of Ecusta Paper Corporation. I found a room in Brevard, which is right near Pisgah Forest, where the elderly gentleman gave us breakfast in lunch bags [laughter] bag lunches. In winter we sledded downhill. On weekends I went home. So, this is all-I&#8217;ll give you this because I&#8217;ve got it on the computer.  DF: Sure, that would be great.  LK: So we really don&#8217;t need to talk too much about that because you can read it.   DF: Sure, but let me-if I could just ask you before that point, before you applied to graduate school, had you felt discrimination either based on your gender or your religion before, or was that really the first time?  LK: I don&#8217;t really know, because it never occurred to me-that&#8217;s just the way things were. And we had a black maid who said well that&#8217;s the way things are. And that&#8217;s the way things were so you didn&#8217;t think a lot about it. Yeah, my life would have been different if they had accepted me in graduate school. I wouldn&#8217;t have met my husbands and a lot of other things [laughter].  DF: Is it fair to say that that event sparked, though, a sort of new awareness on your part?   LK: Well, I wasn&#8217;t into the women&#8217;s movement at that time. And there wasn&#8217;t any women&#8217;s movement. [laughter]. OK, so, we got out of-this is all pretty interesting, but you can read it. Well, you might say I was influenced by working for Friends World College, where I was a volunteer. And they were all-it was organized by the Society of Friends, and they were all activists. So, when we lived in Lloyd Harbor, that&#8217;s when the children were born, and you&#8217;ll get all that in this here. So I went back and got a master&#8217;s degree in management because that&#8217;s the only thing that was available. And my department head asked me to teach a class, oh sure, I taught a class I had never taken, but that didn&#8217;t stop me.   DF: What was the class? Do you remember the title?  LK: First class I thought?  DF: Yeah.  LK: Problems of Motivation. A course I had not taken. So I went to the library and dug up all the information. And now that was about that time 1970, that I got interested in Friends World College. So, that was really the beginning of my teaching. I never intended to become a teacher, but teaching on the graduate level was not like teaching in high school or elementary school. So, then we started traveling and went to Denmark and Sweden.  DF: How long did you work at the Friends College? How long were you active there?  LK: Well they moved to Lloyd Harbor and they didn&#8217;t have any office space for me. But I organized meetings there, and at that time-it doesn&#8217;t sound like I was too much of an activist there. I was with the League of Women Voters and I started editing a quarterly journal called Journal of World Education, and that went all over the world. Well, you might say that my activism started in Weaverville, then.  DF: Can I ask you during your time in New York City, did you cross paths with the Jewish community there, or was that-  LK: In New York?   DF: Yeah.  LK: Oh, well, I didn&#8217;t live in the city very long.  DF: OK. Or, I&#8217;m sorry, in Long Island.   LK: When we lived in New York I did belong to a Jewish congregation. I don&#8217;t know if it was Rot Shalom or some other name. She likes to go in and out [referring to her cat]. It&#8217;s too bad I don&#8217;t have better records on that. Well, maybe we should have begun with 1977 because that&#8217;s when we moved to Weaverville.  DF: And that was when you got involved with the library?  LK: Yeah, after that. Yeah, that&#8217;s all in here.   DF: I think I read something there about the YWCA. What was your involvement with them? Because honestly that struck me a bit, because a Jewish woman involved with the YWCA, did anyone thing that was-  LK: They don&#8217;t stress religion there. It&#8217;s just a name. They&#8217;re goal is eliminating racism and empowering women. And they don&#8217;t talk about religion there at all. [extended silence as Leah Karpen looks through her papers] OK, here&#8217;s some of the things I did. I got on the nominating committee for the League of Women Voters in Asheville, and nobody wanted to be president! [laughter] So I became president from 1983-85, that&#8217;s right in here. And in 1985 they named me woman of the year for community service. So I guess kind of the activism comes in there. But, it was also teaching. And also I was a counselor for SCORE, and I taught courses at the College for Seniors, and that&#8217;s all in here. And it&#8217;s interesting that all that activism isn&#8217;t even mentioned here. And then I was on the board of the YWCA, I was secretary to the board. And then what happened around that time, we organized a chapter of the Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom. And we used to meet at my house around the big table, and we were very much activists in the community around that time. And I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s when I got involved in nuclear issues-probably. There&#8217;s so much left out here. It may be in that other file. So, maybe your questions will be more appropriate, like on page seven. Let me see what I can find here. Well, after we moved here I was always writing letters to the editor. Now, here&#8217;s something, but it&#8217;s out of order. I wrote a letter, state needs moral turn in the prison system, and unfortunately this clipping isn&#8217;t dated. And last August I organized a task force on prison reform, and I don&#8217;t know how long ago I wrote that letter. You can see a lot of my letters in here.   DF: It sounds like you&#8217;ve just been involved in such a breadth of activities. If you had to characterize yourself as an activist, how would you do it? I mean, it doesn&#8217;t seem like there was any one, you know, particular organization that you latched onto or any one cause, but you were sort of the champion of many things.  LK: Well, I was most involved with the Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom. But, eventually our chapter fell apart. We were getting older and what happened-people got involved in politics. So, I think that&#8217;s it. I was just involved in a lot of different things. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re getting a good story out of this. What I can&#8217;t-what I didn&#8217;t find was-here&#8217;s a good one. If you want copies of anything I can make copies. I&#8217;m not giving you the kind of comprehensive story I wanted to, it&#8217;s just not working out.  DF: That&#8217;s OK, I mean you&#8217;re giving me a lot of information. Just because it&#8217;s not in chronological order, that&#8217;s really not that important. It says-I&#8217;m reading-  LK: This was something that I organized workshops for SCORE [going through files] I don&#8217;t know why things are upside down here. I wrote so many letters to the editor. Here&#8217;s-well, I told you about the woman of the year banquet. Really, it was only because of my work with the League of Women Voters. What I did was I made sure the League was in the paper every week. At that time-OK, I know what happened. Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom was involved in nuclear issues, but our chapter fell apart. So, I joined Physicians for Social Responsibility as a lay member, and that&#8217;s when I got really active in the anti-nuclear movement.   DF: And around what period of time do you think that was?  LK: I&#8217;m trying to think-it was one of the elections. I&#8217;m so frustrated because we have important things-well, I was a member of so many important organizations. Well, I was chosen as woman of the year really for my work with the League of Women Voters, and I guess that&#8217;s when they started noticing me.   DF: And you said that nobody wanted to be the president, right, of the League of Women Voters?  LK: Well, I have a whole book on that thing.  DF: I mean, other than that were there a lot of women involved with the organization or was it then when you got to North Carolina?  LK: Oh, the League was falling apart, but I put it back together again. I really thought I&#8217;d be able to do a better job on this. Well, a lot of this about being woman of the year, and I have a whole scrapbook on that, so this doesn&#8217;t even belong in here-that just what I&#8217;m turning over is stuff about the women of the year [referring to her files]. Well, after that when we moved to Weaverville Morris made more money than he&#8217;d made in New York, so we were able to be philanthropists. And twice we were honored as philanthropists.  DF: Was most of your focus with the philanthropic work, was it mostly centered on Asheville?  LK: Well, we would help organizations get started. And Morris gave a big donation to the University, but that&#8217;s really Morris&#8217;s life, not mine. I never could figure out why they made so much fuss over me. Well, about 1983 it was, I decided to take the master of liberal arts-lets see if this is dated-1988, sorry. This must be a copy [referring to her diploma]. Oh, and then I got on this state league board, and I used to go to meetings in Greensboro.   DF: The League of Women Voters?  LK: Yeah. So in 1988 I started to master of liberal arts at UNC in Asheville. And, here&#8217;s my transcript from that time. I want to see when I finished it. Well, it took me two and a half or three years to finish that.   DF: And that was in management? Management degree you said? Or not?  LK: No, that was master of liberal arts. See, I&#8217;ve veered off onto something else. So I said this was all family history here-I&#8217;ve got to go through these files again. Well, this is two years ago, 2011? That doesn&#8217;t make sense. Well, Pisgah Legal Services honored me, yeah, 2011, I was honored by Pisgah Legal Services for community work and I couldn&#8217;t figure out why, because I hadn&#8217;t done that much for them. I&#8217;m really frustrated that I haven&#8217;t given you a good story.  DF: That&#8217;s OK, I mean let&#8217;s just-we still a little bit more time before you have to go, lets just talk a little bit. It doesn&#8217;t have to be in order.  LK: OK, ask questions.   DF: Well just, can you tell me a little bit about what you were doing with the YWCA?  LK: OK, I had been on SCORE, S-C-O-R-E, in capitals, Service Core of Retired Executives. So, the YWCA had asked me to be on the board and I said well I couldn&#8217;t, I was too busy. But after I got off of SCORE, I took a position on the board of the YWCA. As secretary I was a member of the executive committee, and we had meetings in between the board meetings. I don&#8217;t know how important I was on the board, but they thought I was. And at one point, I rescued them financially, but it was a bigger problem than that. And the United Way forced them to take a consultant, which got me very upset. It may have been the right thing to do, but it got me very upset, because we had to pay this consultant. [big gust of wind] Looks like trouble, we may have to go in. Did you lose much? Good thing you numbered those pages. So, we had board meetings once a month. I was on it for two terms, and the second term I quit after two years because we were living in Weaverville and my husband didn&#8217;t like me going to those meetings at night. He resented that more than other things I had done, I don&#8217;t know why. He didn&#8217;t mind when I was in the League of Women Voters. Then, they Y decided to engage upon a capital campaign. So, they made me honorary co-chair of the capital campaign. And theoretically, the honorary chair doesn&#8217;t do anything, but I helped them raise money and it was nice using my name because it was well known in the community by then. I&#8217;ve been a contributor to the Y since then. Oh, we used to have this phone bank where we&#8217;d call people for money. It was awful. Believe me. They don&#8217;t do that anymore. They still have an annual fund, but they don&#8217;t do it that way. That&#8217;s just the worst thing you can do is call. And people would say my husband&#8217;s out of work, or I&#8217;m out of work, and you know, you just hate doing things like that. I don&#8217;t know why they honored me at the YW. I mean, it could be because at meetings I speak out and speak my opinion, and that could be part of it. I don&#8217;t know. So, what did I do after. I guess that was when I went for the MLA program. When I was doing that I wasn&#8217;t involved in organizations at all. Oh, that&#8217;s right, I was looking for my diploma in there and I couldn&#8217;t find it, to remember what year it was that I got it.   DF: What about-was there a Jewish Community Center in town?   LK: There&#8217;s a Jewish Community Center. I&#8217;ve never been active in that because it didn&#8217;t meet my needs. It really centers a lot on children, and I didn&#8217;t have any needs that they would fulfill. I didn&#8217;t need a social life. I had enough going on. I participate a lot in cultures, lectures, things like that. I organized a lot of meetings when I was active in Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom. And even after that at PSR, Physicians for Social Responsibility, I&#8217;d organize public meetings. We met once a month and mostly lobbied our representatives. It still seems like it&#8217;s almost a lost cause. I was going to the PSR meetings once a month on Fridays, and I finally decided that I wasn&#8217;t accomplishing anything, and so I quit going there. And shortly after that I organized the task force on prison reform. As far as the congregation, I had been president of the Sisterhood in Huntington, Long Island, and I didn&#8217;t want to do that again. So, I didn&#8217;t get involved in the sisterhood at all in the congregation. I found in general I didn&#8217;t relate well to women&#8217;s groups, except for the YWCA. There&#8217;s too much small talk.  DF: Was that the main problem with the sisterhood?  LK: So, at one time in our congregation in the summertime there wasn&#8217;t much going on, and I would organize meetings with films on nuclear issues. I guess I did a lot of things that I don&#8217;t even remember because I didn&#8217;t document them. Maybe if I had saved all my old calendars I could tell you all the things I had been doing [laughter].   DF: No, but I mean these tidbits that are coming out are interesting.  LK: You&#8217;re getting the feel? [laughter]  DF: I am!  LK: Over the phone I started talking to you and said, oh there&#8217;s lots of things I can tell you and now I don&#8217;t remember what I was talking about! [laughter]  DF: Well tell me a little bit more about this prison reform task force that you organized. Was this the most-this sounds like this was recent.  LK: This started in August. We meet once a month and Pam Laughon, L-A-U-G-H-O-N, at UNCA, she&#8217;s chair of the psychology department, somebody suggested I should talk with her. So, I went up to meet with her and she said, this is a great idea. I can get you a meeting room and a date. And so she&#8217;s co-chair of the group and she sends out all the emails. I&#8217;ll send her the information and she&#8217;ll forward the email to everybody. We get about eight or ten people usually at our meetings. We usually have a speaker because we&#8217;re still learning. And we&#8217;ve had a judge, we had the sheriff. And it turned out, we invited the sheriff, and he said, well you need to get Karen McDonald because she just retired from work with one of the juvenile justice departments, and she has joined our group. But we were talking to the sheriff about a proposal, House Bill 632 in North Carolina, which would raise the age for juveniles from 16 to 18 to be treated as adults. And the sheriff said he supports that, and I said well can we quote you, and he said oh yes. So he&#8217;s been going around talking to different sheriffs, and if the sheriffs want that it wont be hard to get it through the legislature. We&#8217;ve got a Republican legislature that doesn&#8217;t want to do anything right except repeal everything we&#8217;ve done right. So, we think we can get that through and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working on right now, trying to inform as many people as possible.   DF: That&#8217;s really interesting.  LK: So, the other thing that&#8217;s high on our agenda is abolishing capital punishment. I have some ideas on that, but unfortunately I keep getting distracted so I haven&#8217;t called somebody that I need to talk to about that. But I don&#8217;t know if we can get that in North Carolina, because we&#8217;ve got so many hard headed people in North Carolina.  DF: Is it fair to say that this prison reform task force is your main focus right now?   LK: Yes, it&#8217;s the main thing that I&#8217;m working on. But I&#8217;ve been a volunteer for a long time. I first volunteered at the art museum. I guess this is part of what&#8217;s going on with my community activism. At the art museum I was doing the front desk and that got really boring. I said, can&#8217;t you find something else for me to do, and she said yeah, we want to organize a library. Oh, I said, that&#8217;s easy I did one at the underwriter&#8217;s laboratories. Well, that was nothing like what we do now. That was on card files, and now it&#8217;s all on computer. So, people started donating books. On one of my birthdays my husband gave a check to them for buying books. So we were off. We have four volunteers that meet once a week on Thursday mornings to keep this library going. And if you&#8217;d see it you&#8217;d say, that&#8217;s a professional library! Well two of them are professionals, but, I mean it&#8217;s really organized. We use the Dewey Decimal system. The Library of Congress is too complex for what we&#8217;re doing. So, besides that on Wednesday I volunteer in the mornings for Pisgah Legal Services. I started out in the development department helping with the capital campaign. And they were kind of impressed by what I did-that&#8217;s how they ended up honoring me. But, I didn&#8217;t think it was that great. I would call people and say this is Leah Karpen I&#8217;m calling on behalf of Pisgah Legal Services. So it ended up, it would be Leah, how much money did you get. You know, I didn&#8217;t have any problem getting money from people. So, I&#8217;m still volunteering there, but I&#8217;m doing what I call call backs. They get sixty to ninety calls every day, and they have to call people back and get enough information to turn it over to the legal department. And, so that&#8217;s-it really interesting. It&#8217;s not easy getting information from people, but, well, you feel like you&#8217;ve done something important when you do it. So, I volunteered with the literacy council. I got trained for teaching English as a second language. I don&#8217;t know how many years I did that. One of my students got her citizenship so I said to her, well, I can&#8217;t go any further with you. You&#8217;ve got your citizenship now. But, she still wanted to study English and she took another tutor. I tutored a number of different students, and it seemed they never were able to finish up. They always had so many personal problems or they moved away or whatever. So, I&#8217;m not tutoring anymore. I really was trying to do too much, anyway. So, I guess my volunteer work is kind of interesting to people. Well, another thing, when we came to Weaverville in 1977 I said well, I want to start exercising. This is something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do. So I founded an exercise group, and I&#8217;ve been exercising ever since. This is one thing that has been important to other people because they see my health and it&#8217;s convinced them. We have a group of training partners on Meriman Avenue and a lot of them feel like, you know, look at what she&#8217;s doing. She&#8217;s 91 and she&#8217;s still exercising. So they&#8217;re not giving up. So I think it&#8217;s influenced a lot of people. Then, in the congregation, I haven&#8217;t been active as far as holding any positions there. But, I go to services every Friday. And I used to invite people for dinner on Friday nights. That was when my grandson was here and he and his wife would come for dinner and there&#8217;d be another person. So, there&#8217;d be four people around the table. After he left I did find people, but one of them moved away and the other can&#8217;t come anymore, so I&#8217;m not doing Friday night dinners. But, we had a community wide, what they call Shamas Dinner. So, instead of having services we invited people into our home for dinner. So, I had dinner for twelve, and it was a potluck. And I just had a phone call today of somebody who said how much she enjoyed it. So, that worked out very well. But, I have to say that it&#8217;s almost too much for me at this point in my life. [laughter].  DF: Sure. I&#8217;m trying to think. Are there-I feel like we&#8217;ve touched on a lot of organizations. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ve left any out. We have the League of Women Voters, the YWCA-  LK: Women&#8217;s International League for Peace. That was very important. I used to do the newsletter as well. Of course, now nobody does newsletters except on email. So, what happened is we didn&#8217;t move into the electronic age, but I don&#8217;t know if it would have made any difference, because people weren&#8217;t willing to join anything. If I could just get the date that we disbanded. Who was the president before Bush? There was George W. Bush, wasn&#8217;t it? There were two Bushes.   DF: You mean the first Bush?  LK: Yeah.  DF: OK. Wasn&#8217;t it Reagan before?  LK: No, it was after Reagan. I think that&#8217;s when people got active. They were trying to work against the Republicans taking over. But, you can&#8217;t have that kind of organization and also be politically active. You&#8217;ve got to do one thing or the other.   DF: So, it was probably the mid to late 80s?  LK: Yeah. Well actually, I took all the papers from the Women&#8217;s International League and put them at the special collections at the university. It&#8217;s too bad you don&#8217;t live around here because you could go into that special collections and you could get a lot of information there. So, I&#8217;m frustrated that what I&#8217;ve given you is not a very good picture of my activism [laughter].  DF: It&#8217;s a nice sampling, though. And it&#8217;s nice to know that there&#8217;s so much available at the special collections, because I&#8217;m not too terribly far away. I can come back and look at that and I can follow up with you if specific questions spark from there. But even though this wasn&#8217;t exactly in chronological order, you did give me a lot. I think when we go back and listen, when you hear this recording you&#8217;ll be surprised at how much you did tell me.   LK: Well, I&#8217;m not sure the recording is worth saving in the archives. Some time ago a woman came over and interviewed me. And I thought she was really a poor interviewer. She didn&#8217;t get anything really good out of me, because she didn&#8217;t know how to ask the questions. So, let me think how I can lead you into something. Well, besides the fact that I started that Great Decisions discussion group in Weaverville. I continued my interest in foreign policy, and I go to all the meetings of the world affairs council, which we have in Asheville. I&#8217;m not an officer, I just come to all the meetings. And I did organize a meeting for them on nuclear issues, and they said they wouldn&#8217;t do that again because they&#8217;re not an activist organization, they&#8217;re just educational, because they&#8217;re 501-C3. I used to organize meetings at our congregation. We had a meeting on human rights a couple of times. I guess they&#8217;re lots of things that I don&#8217;t even think about or remember.  DF: Well, were these meetings at the congregation well attended? Because earlier in the interview I think you mentioned how members of the congregation cared-didn&#8217;t seem too terribly interested in activist activities.   LK: Well, what has happened is there&#8217;s a woman named Lottie Meyerson organized the social justice committee, and out of that has come a lot of good things. But, they were never really interested in my nuclear issues. That was something too far off for them. It had to be local. So, I think people have become much more activist. Not everybody, but it&#8217;s around there. Someone said that the churches look to our congregation for leadership in social action, which surprised me, but I guess that it&#8217;s more known than the churches are. So, Reform Judaism is built on the idea of social justice and ethical living. That&#8217;s very important. Somebody asked me the other day about ethical living. Well, you know, they&#8217;re going, what are your ethics? I said, well, it&#8217;s doing what&#8217;s right. What else can you say about that? Isn&#8217;t that a funny question?  DF: Do you think your involvement-or what do you think the connection is, if there was any, between your involvement in the Jewish community with the Reform tradition and your activism later in life?  LK: Well, as I said I was influenced by my brother, Rabbi Michael Robinson, and I think that perhaps I take after my father because you can see that he was active in the community. Maybe I get it from him. Certainly not from my mother. She was a PTA-type person. And I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve influenced my children that much, but I have a grandson that kind of got the message from me.   DF: What does he-is he-  LK: Well, for example, he reads the magazine Mother Jones. Do you know that one? [laughter]  DF: Yes I do. [laughter]  LK: OK. So, friends said to me, don&#8217;t you subscribe to the Nation? I said no. So, I started subscribing to the Nation and I thought, why haven&#8217;t I been doing this? It&#8217;s the only newspaper that gives you the truth about everything. I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to put this together.   DF: That&#8217;s the fun part. [laughter] That&#8217;s the puzzle.   LK: Well, I think part of what it shows you, and you mentioned it, is that I have a number interests. Right now I&#8217;m trying to cut things down because one day I was just going all day from one meeting to another. At the end of the day-so, today, I went to Pisgah Legal Services and I have an event tonight at the art museum. I could have done two other things, but I&#8217;m not going to do that anymore. If I go someplace in the morning and the evening, it&#8217;s going to be enough. It just got ridiculous. Can I get you something else to eat or coffee or something?  DF: I&#8217;m fine, the cookies have been-  LK: OK, let&#8217;s demolish the cookies. [laughter]  DF: We&#8217;re getting close to the time when you have to do-  LK: Well, what are your plans-are you driving back tonight? Oh dear.  DF: Actually, I&#8217;m going to drive to Davidson.   LK: That&#8217;s farther, isn&#8217;t it?   DF: Actually, it ends up being about the same difference. If I drove straight from here to Chapel Hill that would be four hours and if I drive to Davidson that&#8217;s two hours.  LK: Well, if you leave around four it won&#8217;t be too dark at eight o&#8217;clock. All right.   DF: Well, before I turn this thing off is there anything that you think we&#8217;ve missed or anything that you want to add?  LK: Well, I think we've left out a lot because I did a lot of organizing of meetings on nuclear issues and I don&#8217;t have any specifics on that because I turned over all my papers to the special collection. I didn&#8217;t keep anything. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever heard of Karl Grossman. He&#8217;s a newspaper writer and a professor at one of the colleges on Long Island and I was able to get him to come here to give a lecture, and we did a lot of publicity on it. We did a really big turn out on it. I think that after that I kind of stopped organizing meetings. I still hear from him. He knew my name because on Long Island my husband had run for political office. He never got elected. So, Karl Grossman knew about him. So, I had no trouble getting him to come for almost no fee. We didn&#8217;t have any money. It&#8217;s amazing the things you can do without money. I think we really impose on some of these famous people. [laughter] You may not have heard of Helen Caldicott. She's been here a couple of times. She&#8217;s an Australian physician who gave up her practice to work against nuclear bombs and nuclear power. And at first we didn&#8217;t see the connection between nuclear power and nuclear bombs. Now that we know not only do nuclear plants emit radiation, but we saw what could happen in Japan. And I thought, well I don&#8217;t really need to work on that anymore. That&#8217;s really when I quit working on that. I said, well, after Fukushima I don&#8217;t need to work on this. Well people haven&#8217;t stopped yet! Now Germany is going to dismantle all its nuclear plants. France isn&#8217;t going to be far behind. The U.S.-I don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;re so backwards in our thinking. It&#8217;s really hard being a liberal. You can certainly say that I am. [laughter]  DF: Especially in North Carolina.  LK: Oh yeah. You must have felt that in school here.   DF: Yeah. Well, you know Davidson was sort of an interesting bubble, if you will. Davidson&#8217;s a very liberal area. I mean, Chapel Hill is, too, but whenever you drift outside of those borders it hits you, that conservatism in the state.  LK: Yeah.   DF: Especially compared with Minnesota. Well, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and turn this off.   LK: I think you can turn it off.
