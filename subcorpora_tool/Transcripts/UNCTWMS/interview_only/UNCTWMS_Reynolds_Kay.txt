David Cline: All right, good morning, this is David Cline for the Southern Oral History Program. I am in Knoxville, Tennessee and it&#8217;s May the 21st, I believe, this morning, and if you could introduce yourself?
Kay Reynolds: I&#8217;m Kay Reynolds.
DC: And just a little bit about yourself, and I&#8217;ll ask you questions about your background. I find it&#8217;s very useful to start by talking about people&#8217;s childhoods and their people, and get a sense of what sort of formed one of the works that they&#8217;re doing. We&#8217;re meeting right now in the basement of St. John&#8217;s Cathedral. If you could just tell us about, just briefly, your career. And are you retired now or still working?
KR: I&#8217;m retired but I&#8217;m still working as a supply priest. I&#8217;m an associate at St. Luke&#8217;s Episcopal Church, which has been a historically black Episcopal church in town, and it&#8217;s kind of a mixture of white folks and black folks and I&#8217;m an associate there right now, so I&#8217;m still working, but not full-time or anything.
DC: Right.
KR: I grew up in Louisiana. I was born in &#8217;39, so I&#8217;m seventy years old. I&#8217;ll be seventy-one June 1st. I grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana and was always involved in church. My parents took me to the Baptist church and I grew up in the Southern Baptist Church and remained in that church until I was thirty years old and became an Episcopalian. We had the advantage of having very, very fine musicians and that heritage for me has been a wonderful heritage of the music that I learned and the hymnal, and then the classical music that we learned in our choir. I played the clarinet starting with fifth grade and I was encouraged to play offertory music and some other things at church sometimes with clarinet. I knew I wanted to teach music, but I also had a strong desire to do something in the church, and none of the roles that I saw fit me in the Baptist Church. I was not your gregarious, outgoing youth leader; I was more introverted. I&#8217;m on the border between introverted and extroverted if you believe the tests. Sometimes I want to be by myself and read my book and just leave me alone, and other times I really enjoy being with people, especially people that I know. I&#8217;m not much on the cocktail party sort of thing. So I grew up and there were no roles. I mean, we didn&#8217;t have women ministers and preachers, and I was not the youth director and I was not the keyboard person to be the choir person in that that was not as important to me as the instrument. So, I grew up and I was sure I wanted to teach music, which I did. I taught junior high music; went to LSU to get my training, so I lived in Baton Rouge and moved to Mobile for my first teaching job. I taught at a junior high school. I moved to Meridian, Mississippi; I think I was there two years. My boss left, and so I left and went to Ohio because I wanted to go to grad school at Ohio State. I ended up teaching general music and band at a little school system in Mt. Vernon. So I was there for two years and then I went back to grad school and got a master&#8217;s and a Ph.D. at Ohio State in Music Ed., so I was teaching. Meanwhile, I had gone to the American Baptist Church in Ohio and while I was there I attended the Good Friday services at the Episcopal church across the street from our church. I was the choir director at the Baptist church in town. So anyway, I became interested in the Episcopal Church, and after my Ph.D., I went to Otterbein College, a Methodist-affiliated college, to teach, in Westerville Ohio, right outside of Columbus. That was a remarkable experience; the faculty was incredibly gifted and the camaraderie was great and I still have friends from there. I talked to one the other day, and that was ages ago. But, a wonderful place, and we had good experiences there. While I was there--in summer school before, actually before grad school I began attending the Episcopal church at campus, St. Stephens right there. It used to be on the edge of campus and now it&#8217;s kind of enclosed because the campus is expanded.
DC: Right.
KR: That was a remarkable place and that was remarkable clergy people, and I was taken in to that congregation and was in the choir and on the Christian Ed Committee and on the vestry there. I went to the regional liturgy and music--I was totally involved in that parish and enjoyed it tremendously.
DC: How was that transition from the Southern Baptist--?
KR: Well, I was mostly worried about what my parents were going to think. I wrote them a nice letter and said, &#8220;I really appreciated my upbringing in a Baptist church, but this is something I really need to do.&#8221; It was not just the music, which was incredibly good and different, but it was the freedom of belief and expression and I enjoyed that. It wasn&#8217;t so much about what you weren&#8217;t supposed to do as what you were supposed to do in terms of reaching out to people. I think that was one of those places where changing denominations affected my interest or at least increased it in outreach to whomever--you know, needy folks of whatever sort, and social action. That was really important to me.
DC: Was that something that you had found a way to express in the Southern Baptist tradition or not as much?
KR: Well, I was frustrated in the American Baptist Church; I wasn&#8217;t that much interested. I mean, I knew we gave money to help all kinds of people, and I was also not cut out to be a missionary. That was another option for women when I was growing up, and that didn&#8217;t seem like something I should be doing. It appealed, but it just wasn&#8217;t me. And my social skills--I&#8217;m a very shy person and I was even shyer then, so that just didn&#8217;t  --you know, doing that kind of thing. But the transition was really educational for me, but even the hymns, which I greatly attracted to, and it was even the old hymnal and not the current one, which is even more interesting; the hymns speak of community more than they speak of me and Jesus. So the notion of those hymns--or they remind us of what God has done for us in various ways or they remind us of opportunities to praise God or to give thanksgiving. They&#8217;re not so much &#8220;me and Jesus&#8221;; it&#8217;s more community and what we as a church ought to be doing. So anyway, and there&#8217;s plenty in there that helps you develop your own spirituality. I don&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s not, but the sense of community which is different, and I grew up in the Baptist church knowing that I was a part. It wasn&#8217;t that I felt excluded, but the community feeling is just completely different for me. And then, of course, being able to study scripture and have more than one opinion and being able to argue, and nobody&#8217;s going to throw you out. We had all kinds of people, and I grew up in a very liberal Baptist church. You know, rural tends to be a little bit more conservative, but that&#8217;s a sweeping generalization. But anyway, that was very important for my growth, and I attended the Episcopal church from the time I began summer school in whatever that was, &#8217;66, I guess. So, I did all that and then&#8230;
DC: &#8230;So that was a time--I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt, but in the mid-sixties when there must have been a lot going on as far as&#8230;
KR: &#8230;And that&#8217;s what I meant to tell you. The American Baptist Church in this little town, Mt. Vernon, had a great minister. I really enjoyed him, and he taught our Adult Sunday School class. It was kind of a career class, but the problem was, if I brought up what was going on in the area right then, or it was the American Indian stuff that was going on, Native American stuff and black issues. I&#8217;m trying to remember the time frame, but we had Kent State; we had Jackson State; we had Martin Luther King&#8217;s death while I was teaching at Mt. Vernon. There was so much going on during that period, and I could not rustle up any interest in that adult Sunday School class. You know, I would bring in magazine articles or I would bring in something. You know, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; It was like the individual salvation, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re interested in. You know, &#8220;Well, we know all this stuff&#8217;s going on, but we&#8217;re interested in saving people individually, and I was thinking okay, but shouldn&#8217;t we be doing something about these issues? Shouldn&#8217;t we at least take a stand? There were Baptist people who were making trips to the Deep South and trying to be supportive and so forth and so on, or setting an example or being brave and gutting up and, you know, doing things to express an opinion about civil rights issues. So it was a very interesting time, and then I was on campus at Ohio State in the summers and that&#8217;s when we had riots and we had to close down campus, and guess what was open and guess what the place was that invited any group that wanted to meet there on whatever side? The Episcopal Church was open; it never closed. So you could go on campus, because I had to go on campus to visit my advisor, but you know, that&#8217;s when they started closing off--you couldn&#8217;t just drive through cars all the way through it any more.
DC: Right.
KR: They started closing it off. They put up big temporary barriers to avoid crowds and all that stuff, and St. Stephens was open.
DC: And did that--was it really used as a meeting ground?
KR: Oh, yeah, and it was always open to all kinds of groups that were not necessarily welcome just anywhere.
DC: Was there an active campus Y at that time?
KR: I don&#8217;t know.
DC: Yeah, okay, I&#8217;m just curious.
KR: I don&#8217;t have a clue about that then, but our place was the place that was open and welcoming. So anyway, that was important too, and I continued to attend church there and be involved in all the stuff that was going on until &#8217;80, when I had gotten a job, &#8217;75 to &#8217;80, &#8217;74 to &#8217;80, when I finished my degree, teaching at Otterbein. That was a very liberal place. They had seminars for freshmen; instead of just English, you could take regular English, in which you studied literature and you wrote and your composition skills were honed and all that, or if you were lacking some skills, they would do remedial stuff. But anyway, you could either do the standard English course that was literature and composition, or you could take a freshman seminar which was taught by any of us faculty. You wanted to submit a plan, and we could teach a course based on the topic that we wanted to teach it on, and we would follow the guidelines that the English Department had. For the composition, we required that a student send in so many papers. We were told we needed to have at least three papers, whatever it was, but the guidelines were set up. Then we followed those and if we had a question, like once I took a paper to the guy in charge of the program and said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got. I want to check in with you and see if our grading is kind of on the same track,&#8221; so we did. I taught a course in creativity because I had taken a Psychology of Creativity course, and, being in music and all, I&#8217;ve been very interested in all kinds of creativity. So those courses were fine for the kids and then they had to write based on that topic. Somebody taught a course in communes because he had gone to communes; he and his wife had visited communes. Somebody taught a course in urban--I don&#8217;t know what you call it--urban existence. At that point, students were given, you know, like five dollars and dropped off in downtown Columbus, which is a big city, after they had talked about survival skills in an urban area.  You know, they were rappelling off of our building and doing all kinds of interesting things, but this was a place that had an atmosphere that was really kind of neat and open.
DC: Sounds like it.
KR: Yeah, so I enjoyed teaching there, but the problem was, in 1980 we had a recession and they had told me the year before that &#8220;we don&#8217;t want you to go anywhere else; we want you to stay here and do music education.&#8221; I supervised student teachers and taught courses in methods and all that stuff. But the first day of school in &#8217;80, they called me in and said &#8220;Oops, we&#8217;re in a recession. We&#8217;re not changing anybody to tenure because I was on the cheap track. Then, after six years, if you were gone, but they were going to keep the position and keep me in it and make it tenured, so that didn&#8217;t happen. So, for a year I didn&#8217;t have a regular teaching job. That&#8217;s how I ended up in Mississippi, and I always think of it as the &#8220;toe of God&#8221; sending me to [laughter] a whole new situation in Mississippi which was wonderful as it all turned out. So, thus, the toe of God image, but booted out of a comfortable place where I thought I was going to stay. So anyway, I moved to Hattiesburg and at William Carey, which is the little Baptist school. I taught there for six years and then went to seminary from Hattiesburg. I don&#8217;t remember particularly--there were various activist things while I was still in Columbus, and one of our young women who was in our church, a college student, was interested in the peace movement and she was working with some of the Quakers who were doing demonstrations and things like that. Because she was in a march, she lost her job. She was a wardrobe mistress for, I&#8217;ve forgotten, opera or theater or something, and she lost her job. They fired her because I guess they saw her in a peace march. So we were surrounded by social issues during most of that time. I don&#8217;t remember what I did. I do remember when I was in Columbus in grad school, I was pretty grubby because I just wore, you know, [pause] whatever. We had a church group that was going to meet in a park and I had on blue jeans and a sweat-shirt or something, and I got there and I was badly--treated rudely by somebody who was there in the park. You know, we were trying to find out where our group was going to be or something. I got really irate because he was treating us--treating me, because I looked like crap--you know, I was just a student.
DC:  Um-hmm, right.
KR: Of course, I was forty years old, but anyway, and so it really irked me and I mentioned it to one of the other people who basically had a better sense than I did, and I grew into understanding that being irate wasn&#8217;t going to get you far. You had that kind of experience and I went into--as a grad student, I remember going into the big library at Ohio State and returning some books. I looked at the sign and I put the books down on the desk by the sign because I thought was where it was telling me to put them. As I walked away, the student who was working there hollered at me and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave those books there! Put those books over in this thing.&#8221; So I turned around and calmed myself and very slowly said, &#8220;If you want the books put in the correct place, perhaps you need to make the sign less ambiguous.&#8221; I thought you know, if I went in, an undergraduate person, and I wasn&#8217;t forty y ears old, I would have just said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Why should anybody be treated rudely because they&#8217;re a student?
DC: Right.
KR: I had some other run-ins with the red tape at the university because they just said, &#8220;Well, blap! That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s going to be.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, wait a minute. Here&#8217;s what you say your policy is, but this is not clear, and so therefore, I tried to follow your policy.&#8221; I did win a few points that way, but I kept being appalled. &#8220;Well, no, you can&#8217;t pay that here. You&#8217;ll have to go over there, but then why does it say to pay it here? And these poor undergraduates, they just have to do it. I said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t I wait here while you send somebody over there because I have walked across campus now four times and I don&#8217;t want to do it any more.&#8221; So it&#8217;s just that kind of stuff I&#8217;ve always been kind of aware of and probably way too defensive, but I&#8217;ve seen the example of other people and I&#8217;ve changed, of course, to where I&#8217;m able to say, &#8220;Okay, I don&#8217;t have to be offended. I can look on and I can be calm and I can say something that matters, but I don&#8217;t have to be angry and I don&#8217;t have to be ugly.&#8221; That&#8217;s part of my religious background. When I went to grad school, I began to live with a woman who was my mother&#8217;s age and she was widowed, and she was a member, an associate of the Community of the Transfiguration in Cincinnati, and she made it possible for me to drive down with her and become acquainted with that. Then I became affiliated with it while I was in grad school.
DC: What is that? Can you tell me about that?
KR: It&#8217;s basically an Episcopal convent with an order of nuns called the Community of the Transfiguration. I began doing some serious spiritual reading when I was there, about various kinds of spiritual practices, the notion of silence--you don&#8217;t have to say something just because you&#8217;ve been treated rudely. You don&#8217;t have to say something just because you&#8217;re outraged. Sometimes, the best plan is not to speak, but to be silent, so that was really hard for me to get my mind around. But there were other spirituality issues and every time I would go, I would pick up three or four books and then settle on one for the time I was there and try to absorb some new thing from their library because Episcopalians really do have a lot to say about spiritual disciplines and practices, it&#8217;s just that we don&#8217;t push those all the time. We&#8217;re a little better at it now. There&#8217;s a group here, for instance, that does centering prayer and there&#8217;s a Benedictine group that meets regularly, so we&#8217;re more aware. I went to a couple of Catholic workshops on Ignatian spirituality, and one of the reasons I did that was because I was in the process of deciding whether I was really supposed to be going to seminary. Discernment is an Ignatian thing, so I did a discernment workshop as a lay person at a Catholic place in Louisiana. Anyway, the convent was very important to me; that&#8217;s like a home; that&#8217;s like one of my homes, because I don&#8217;t have much family. I have one cousin and his family, which is great, but that&#8217;s all there is and my parents are gone now.
DC: So that&#8217;s a place where you could go and stay for a while and study and contemplate?
KR: Yeah, I can go and be there for a week and be in silence as many days as I want to be, and then come out of silence and talk with folks and meet people from all over the world or the country who are also visiting there and having wonderful conversations. I had one with somebody who had just come back from India, you know, and people of all sorts and places. Not so many from the Deep South, but, so you get all kinds of different backgrounds of folks. So that&#8217;s been very important to me. And of course, the convents are amazingly interested in what&#8217;s going on in the world in terms of social action and caring for people. So the intercessory prayers there always amazing, and you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Well, these are sisters&#8221;; well, they&#8217;re not tucked away from the world. They&#8217;re not a group that&#8217;s completely isolated and they watch television on the news programs; the daily news is on right before the evening meal, when it&#8217;s a time they can talk and it&#8217;s not silent. They all gather in a community room and they&#8217;re watching the news. They know what&#8217;s going on in the world and their prayers reflect that. So, they&#8217;re talking about the earthquake in Haiti, or they&#8217;re talking this, that, and the other. So that was interesting to me in terms of hearing that the prayers and the actions of those folks. They have missions in Honduras and they have a place in Lincoln Heights that&#8217;s basically a black place. They have a--like a recreation program over there. They&#8217;re deeply involved in outreach to the community.
DC: Did you ever consider joining that order?
KR: No, I didn&#8217;t. The person said if she hadn&#8217;t been married the first time she went there, she would have joined him in a second, and I thought yeah, but then she was more spiritual than I am. [Laughter] Learning the silence that you observe was a new experience for me too, and I found that it was very comfortable, but it was new and so I did that. No, I didn&#8217;t really think about it, and basically, they tried to have people there who were younger than I was.
DC: Okay, right.
KR: You know, they didn&#8217;t really have an official cutoff date of forty, I don&#8217;t think, but I don&#8217;t know what they do now or what they say, but no, that did not seem an option for me. It is still a very important place for me, but it&#8217;s not one that I thought I would be able to do. And that life is extremely difficult; I have to tell you. It is a hard life, a wonderful life, but it&#8217;s difficult. So I don&#8217;t know, but I ended up in this job in Hattiesburg and I had no idea what the Episcopal Church in Mississippi was like--had no clue, and St. Stephens had been wonderful. I did not what I was getting into, so I moved to Hattiesburg, checked out the two Episcopal churches in town, because it&#8217;s not a huge town; it&#8217;s a big university town, but it&#8217;s not a huge town. Of course, it&#8217;s in Baptist land. So anyway, when I moved there I checked out the two churches and cast my lot in with the small church which was also the campus ministry, because I&#8217;d have been teaching college and university and was teaching at Carey college while I was there. So I cast in my lot with the small church, which was like maybe sixty people on Sunday, a few more at the earlier service, and sang in the choir and later was the choir director there. The first year I was there I was involved in the adult camping program which came up here to Suwannee, Tennessee, and did whitewater over in Nantahala and all that, and got involved in a camping program for adults, speaking of outreach, so that we could have kids who were court-referred kids. We had a court-referred program for delinquents, basically. We had the boys from St. Michaels Farm in Picayune, Mississippi that came up. We had camp for them a number of times. Then we just simply had camp for junior high and high school kids. So, for the adults to go out, you learned all the ropes and you learned all the safety procedures, and you learned the location and where to get water and how to do everything so that if you were going to do it, you could serve on a camp staff for the children.
DC: Right.
KR: So we went up in October and May, and I did indeed serve on some camp staffs. The first summer I was in Mississippi--I guess it was &#8217;80, &#8217;81; I served on a camp staff for special needs people. That was about sixty campers who were anywhere from maybe--I don&#8217;t know who the youngest was at that point, like they might have been six or seven years old, and we had adults who were, say, seventy or seventy-two. We had sixty campers and a large staff because of ratio needs. Some basically were self-motivated and able to care for themselves, so we might have a whole cabin of people with no counselors and just one adult in the adult room which happened to adjoin in Mississippi at our physical camp. That was a terribly draining emotional experience. Uh! That was life-changing, and I did that then, at least one or two of those camps every summer. I did a fourth-grade camp and I did one of the special camps, and I directed a special camp two years, I believe it was.
DC: So that&#8217;s interesting; you said it was draining and then in the next sentence, you said you kept going back.
KR: Well, it was remarkable, but you know, it was like--in the first place, this was a high point of a lot of those people&#8217;s lives for the year. They looked forward to it, and they would come, and it was high-energy with--not always, but it was high-energy with the counselors and the directors and all, high-energy. It was a lot of activities, quiet activities because they could fish, they could do crafts--. Sometimes it was really around with the weather; we would watch a movie, but we tried not to do movies. It was really, why do you go to camp? Not for a movie, so we tried to avoid that, but fishing and boating and getting people who were scared to death into a vest and into a boat or into the swimming pool if they were scared to death of swimming. We had people who would be scared to death every year because they didn&#8217;t get to swim during the year, and here they were, you know? So that was all very difficult, but it was great and it was exciting and it was fun. They had a big talent night and people would do all kinds of talent. It was great. They would bring their costumes for the talent show because they knew that was going to happen every year. You know, I still think of people who were campers back then, you know? But I was drained. I was also sick the second camp I went to. I had a bad cold and it was really bad news, but I took a lot of music stuff and we had storytelling and music. That was our thing, and so we would do movement or dance. We would have the campers mime the stories that we would tell. Then one year we brought up a storyteller who told great stories for the whole crowd, but he also had each of the counselors memorize a story and tell it in their groups to their campers and the other counselors. So, that was a marvelous summer when we had that person there. These were week-long camps. I also did third and fourth grade camp a couple of times, which was a hoot.
DC: I&#8217;ll bet.
KR: Trying to teach little girls not to get the hook caught in their finger while you&#8217;re trying to help them fish and that sort of thing. But those were fun, so I really enjoyed that, and that was another major experience. Then, I was also surrounded by a whole bunch of clergy because every camp had three or four priests, men or women, so I saw their example in what they could do and their gifts, and they&#8217;re so varied. That&#8217;s one of the things I always felt like in the Baptist church it was like, not really cookie cutter, but kind of. Clergy, you know, the expectations were that you would be this way and it was kind of more conformity. So, in the Episcopal Church, I got this opportunity, especially with the camp, to meet all these different clergy. You know, I--vastly different and vastly effective but so different&#8230;
DC: &#8230;From one another&#8230;
KR: &#8230;in personality and their training. A lot of us are second-career people, so you had people there who had been in different things, and very few who had gone right from college to seminary in the sixties and seventies and eighties. I mean, that had changed a lot; now we&#8217;re trying to get younger people again.
DC: Right.
KR: Anyway, I had this vast array of people and I got to spend a lot of time because we were the adult staff and we had less duties and we just plugged ourselves in wherever we were needed. So we were busy all day, but on the other hand, we got to chat and at night when everybody was down, we would sit out and play ping-pong or talk or visit. So we had a great time with those camps, and like I said, I did that, did from one to three every summer from the time I started doing all that. A couple of them were the junior high pioneer camps that would come up to here and go rappelling and climbing and caving and whitewater, do all that stuff. Anyway, that was very important, so I did begin to think maybe I could do Christian Ed, maybe I could be a deacon, but I was already forty-six by then, so you know, in our tradition it&#8217;s three years at seminary and most people are not too big on trying to do the study by yourself in your diocese. My bishop really didn&#8217;t want people to do that much. Very few people do that--called the Reading for Orders.
DC: Right.
KR: But anyway, I started talking with my priest in Mississippi about the fact that I was thinking seriously about this, and he was urging me not to go the deacon route but to go the priestly route. Then I started talking to other people in the congregation and there was a young women who out of a place to live for a while, and I said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got an empty room,&#8221; because I had lived with other people and they had moved to another house one year, so she lived with me for six weeks or whatever until she could get another arrangement. She said, &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve always seen you as a priest.&#8221; I was kind of aghast and surprised, but I was getting good feedback from people who said, &#8220;Yeah, this is great.&#8221; You have to go through approval from the vestry of the church and they were all gung ho, and my priest was very supportive. So I ended up going to the bishop and I did a summer of CPE because I was past the period of time when I could start into this discernment process. So I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to go and do CPE as a way of testing (34:53),&#8221; which is another term that I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve probably heard. So I did that and I was like a chaplain from the day that I went in there and put on my little tag. I don&#8217;t mean I was very good, but I mean I was accepted by people there as a chaplain. You know, you were going in cold at a county hospital. It was Hines County Hospital, which is a different name now, but outside of Jackson, so I moved to Jackson and stayed with a friend for the summer and did the whatever many weeks--I think it was about ten weeks of CPE. That was very difficult because I had to do the self-study that you are forced to do in CPE work. That was not a terribly pleasant experience, but I had to deal with my anger and some of my frustrations and some of the shyness issues. You know, a lot of stuff you just have to deal with and you&#8217;re forced to deal with it in CPE.
DC: It&#8217;s a clear process, yeah.
KR: Yeah, so it was a really tough summer and it was also very rewarding. I did minister to a man who was in the hospital for a long time. I have forgotten what his situation was, but he was there--not cancer, but he was very sick. He was a Church of Christ minister, Church of God minister, the fundamentalist kind, not United Church of Christ. You know, he basically had told me the first time I went to see him that he didn&#8217;t believe in women ministers. I said, &#8220;Well, you know, I&#8217;m here&#8221;--I made it clear I was a lay person and that I was acting as a chaplain, though, for the hospital and all that. But I would see him reasonably often, and so after a while he said something about &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t believe in women priests, but now I&#8217;m not talking about you.&#8221; I mean, it was like--.
DC: [Laughter]
KR: But this is a typical&#8230;
DC: &#8230;Right&#8230;
KR: &#8230;this is a typical situation--&#8220;Oh, well, now we actually know a black person. Now we actually know somebody who lives on the street. Now we actually know somebody who is a female priest.&#8221; So now our perception is different. &#8220;We don&#8217;t like them, but hey, you&#8217;re all right.&#8221;
DC: Right. Yeah, classic.
KR: So that was an ongoing experience of that sort of thinking. Anyway, I finished that and then I did go to seminary at Suwannee for three years and there were about--I would say, when I went there--we had a very small class; the place was in transition with deans, and I think bishops were waiting to see how things were going to turn out before they sent a lot of people, so we had a very small class. But it was about fifty--no, it was twenty percent women; that&#8217;s right. Now it&#8217;s up to--that figure is up to about half-and-half.
DC: Is it really?
KR: Yeah, in seminaries, but then it was twenty percent, and so it was a matter of [pause] being different. You know, we actually had people--our classmates would always welcome their priests from home, where you can try to come visit or their bishop would come and visit. We could tell, the women in the seminary could tell whether the priestly person was against women&#8217;s ordination or not. You could tell by the middle of the morning because you&#8217;d be walking down the hall, and here would be your classmate with one of these--you know, his clergy or her clergy. Well, it would be his clergy in that case. You know, you didn&#8217;t exist; they would not acknowledge you walking down the hallway.
DC: Really?
KR: Yeah, so there were interesting experiences about women and women&#8217;s needs and women&#8217;s recognition, that whole nine yards. While we were there, while I was in seminary, Barbara Harris was the first woman to be ordained a bishop in the Episcopal Church. Black and divorced! Oh, my God!
DC: My goodness, right.
KR: Yeah, and so she came and spoke. That was a tremendous experience of having her at the seminary. She spoke at the college, or the university, rather, so there were undergraduates there, many of whom were quite conservative.
DC: What year did you start at the seminary?
KR: &#8217;86 to &#8217;89.
DC: What year did the church start ordaining women?
KR: &#8217;79.
DC: &#8217;79? I thought it was earlier than that.
KR: Well, while I was at St. Stephens, somewhere in that long period of time I was there, we had a young woman from our congregation who was about the third or fourth person ordained in the diocese of New York, I think. We actually had three or four people out of that church, women, who were ordained later. We were encouraged by our priest, you know, and although I wasn&#8217;t thinking that way while I was there, I had in the back of my mind: &#8220;Gee whiz,&#8221; and I was seeing these people and thinking that&#8217;s terribly appealing and interesting to me because I&#8217;ve been a religious person all my life. But, like I said, I could never quite find my Baptist niche. Nothing was really looking like this is what I could do. But the Episcopal church, as I was saying with camp, I saw these people with varied talents, and in some, way conservative and some, way liberal, and some in the middle, but they were all being effective ministers of God and doing great things in different ways. Nobody expected you to be exactly like somebody else. You could take your thing and go with it, to a certain extent. I mean, we&#8217;ve got plenty of restrictions about certain things. I mean, you can&#8217;t just do whatever you jolly well please, but on the other hand, if you&#8217;ve got gifts, there&#8217;s all kinds of opportunities for them to be developed. So, you know, to some extent I&#8217;ve used my music background in churches. Like I said, I pretty much set up the really good music workshop that we had, picking a couple of other people. We had great people helping to do it, but I basically--that was my big contribution because I have that background. I was scared to death to stand up and talk in front of people, but I got over that teaching college and teaching public school. I mean, still, when I was just joining the Episcopal church, I would have a piece of paper that said, &#8220;We&#8217;re reading from,&#8221; you know, &#8220;St. Paul&#8217;s letter to the Corinthians,&#8221; and then I would have at the bottom of that &#8220;the word of the Lord,&#8221; which are the things that you say, because I was that nervous and I had my piece of paper with me. I&#8217;d go up there to read and I&#8217;d be &#8220;yuh, yuh, yuh.&#8221;
DC: [Laughter]
KR: And I gradually got comfortable and now I preach without notes, which is astounding. What I do is, I take my piece of paper that may be something that I&#8217;ve read for sermon prep and hold it in my hand; if I have to have it, I won&#8217;t panic. Yeah, but I&#8217;m preaching basically from what I&#8217;ve prepared and what I&#8217;ve thought about and what I&#8217;ve read, and you know, I&#8217;ve got the sermon in my head and I can preach it. I mean, that&#8217;s an amazing transformation, you know, like that, shaking to [laughter]--and to having to have stuff down. So anyway, that whole seminary process was a good thing. I mean, I was scared a lot of the time. I&#8217;m a good book student person, so I did that. I was, I think--what was I in my class? I&#8217;ve forgotten. I think I was second in my class in terms of academics or no--we had a star, Tom (43:21), who is now the chaplain at the University of the South. He was my classmate.
DC: Oh, okay. Yeah.
KR: The youngest guy there, in his twenties when we were forty. Anyway, Tom was great and he was the first in our class. He had a liberal arts degree from somewhere before he went to seminary, and then there was another guy; he and I were tied for second, I think, in our small class. I did all that, but then all the other stuff you have to learn is another whole ball game, and Suwannee is very good at helping you prepare. So when I got out of seminary, I went to St. Paul&#8217;s in Meridian, Mississippi, back to my diocese because they expect you--they pay for you and they expect you to come back and work.
DC: Okay.
KR: Also, they provided a place, so I was (44:09) for two years at St. Paul&#8217;s and my boss was a wonderful teacher, the director there, was very good about helping me learn pastoral care skills and giving me plenty of opportunities to preach and giving me lots of feedback about things, so I got a good example of pastoral care. He was very good at that. He&#8217;s the dean at the cathedral now, in Little Rock, Arkansas, but he was the priest there. So, I had some hard lessons to learn and I did. I basically knew I really did not want to work with youth group and we had some difficulties with that because I had some problems trying to figure out how to work that. It tends to get dumped on the assistant, which is not a good thing. But anyway, I was there for two years and had lots of opportunities to learn things, and helped with funerals, helped with weddings and helped with--certainly helped with hospital ministry. I did a lot of that.
DC: What did you enjoy most?
KR: I think I enjoyed most learning the preaching skills and doing the pastoral care. There was still one woman there who would not receive communion from a woman, and she actually came to me and said--the previous (45:39) had been a woman--and she actually came to me and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing personal; I just can&#8217;t do it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; You know, she just couldn&#8217;t do it. The thinking is that there were people of a certain age, and this was an older woman who simply couldn&#8217;t get their minds around this because the theory is that this is one of the things that they might have done had it been available when they were younger. Now, you know, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this; and why should you be able to do this?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how much truth there is to that, but that is the speculation about some of that, and that was the only person who had that issue. When I left there, it was very difficult to get a job, and I was trying to get a job placement in a college chaplaincy, and that was simply unheard of. The one that was open, I think, was at Oxford. They just weren&#8217;t going to think about having a woman there. I did not get placed there until--I think I was out for maybe seven months, moved back in with my mother in Shreveport and then got a placement that the bishop worked out for me. I had two small, small-town churches, Forest and Newton, and the third part of my income came from being a hospice chaplain for Hospice of Central Mississippi.
DC: Where are Forest and Newton near?
KR: They&#8217;re kind of close to on a line with Meridian and Jackson.
DC: Okay, so you were still in&#8230;
KR: &#8230;Central Mississippi.
DC: Okay.
KR: Yeah, so I was still there. Forty-five hundred, something like that, small towns. Yeah, and small, very small congregations. So I did that, and the hospice chaplaincy there was a wonderful thing for me to do, but I also learned that&#8217;s not what I was going to do forever because it&#8217;s--there again, it&#8217;s terribly draining&#8230;
DC: &#8230;I&#8217;ll bet, yeah&#8230;  KR: &#8230;and terribly hard work and I admired those nurses and those other people that basically rotated their jobs so that sometimes they were doing paperwork so that they didn&#8217;t have the emotional strain of constantly doing patient care. They would swap around, and we were chaplains to them as much as we were to the patients.
DC: Yeah.
KR: Yeah, yeah, because I mean it&#8217;s just hard work, very hard work. Sometimes you'd have wonderful families and it would be great even though it was difficult, and then other times, you wouldn&#8217;t--it would be not so great but very difficult. [Laughter] But that was really a--I mean, what a learning experience. And then the two little churches were learning experiences, and we had a problem with a black person that showed up at church and they were all upset about it. The person who brought the person there was a newcomer who was trying to make a point about how racist we all were. Well, we all weren&#8217;t, but a couple of people were upset and couldn&#8217;t believe it, and I went around and visited every person in the church and say, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; and it&#8217;s, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re from the Midwest and we&#8217;re used to this, but we don&#8217;t have a problem.&#8221; Then this other person said, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d be happy if we had ninety percent black people and ten percent white. I meet feel a little funny, but I don&#8217;t have any problem.&#8221; You know, so I just went around and talked to everybody. This person was really--the person who had brought the black person--was full of issues and was trying to prove what bigots we all were. That didn&#8217;t last all that long and the person, you know, they didn&#8217;t keep coming, and--. I mean, the person was really trying to help this family and they had issues that they needed help with, but that wasn&#8217;t going to fly out that way. He didn&#8217;t continue coming to church forever, although I think he did. But anyway, I had to go to the bishop and say, &#8220;Uh, this is what&#8217;s happening.&#8221;
DC: Interesting, yeah.
KR: You know, dealing with that. I&#8217;m trying to think if there were other social issues that we were involved with while I was there. I just don&#8217;t remember, but it was still how do you deal with there&#8217;s prejudice against having women clergy and there&#8217;s--. You know, I was invited to do supply at the black church. That was fine with me and with them and [pause] it was still an ongoing learning experience. While I was there, I was still doing some of the camp work in the summer.
DC: Did the churches ever swap out preachers? I mean, did you ever have the minister from the black church come in?
KR: No. No, not usually.
DC: Okay.
KR: No, I don&#8217;t remember doing that [pause], although while I was there, there was a lay person who became a priest from that church. I don&#8217;t remember where he ended up serving, but [pause] I just don&#8217;t remember. It&#8217;s been too long ago, but yeah, there were black clergy but not a lot. I was there, doing that for three years and at that point I got word from a friend that there was an opening at UT at the chaplaincy here, so I came here, came and interviewed and got that position and started up here.
DC: What year was that?
KR: Oh, geez.
DC: Early nineties, right?
KR: [Pause] Let me see. Let&#8217;s see, I was ordained in &#8217;90, &#8217;91. [Pause] It must have been around &#8217;95-&#8217;96 when I came up here.
DC: Okay.
KR: And I was at Tyson House for eight years as college chaplain. While I was there, I got involved in--I think I was still there when I got involved in Jobs with Justice, and I also was asked to be the chaplain for the Integrity Organization, which I still am, although we are not real active right now. But at that point, they were meeting monthly, and I&#8217;m still known as a supporter for gay people, LBGT people.
DC: When did the Integrity work--had it been going for a while?
KR: Yeah, it had already been--yeah, it was already meeting before I got--.
DC: Okay. And you served as the&#8230;
KR: &#8230;Yes&#8230;
DC: &#8230;clergy person to that?
KR: Yes, as the chaplain for them, and still do. So I was involved with that, and Jobs with Justice, I attended while I was there. I don&#8217;t remember exactly how long that was and asked one of the Methodist chaplains if he would come and work. It&#8217;s a coalition; I don&#8217;t know if you know about Jobs with Justice.
DC: I do, yeah, a little bit.
KR: Well, so it&#8217;s a coalition that includes religious organizations and I got the Knoxville Ministerial Association to join and be a member of that, and Jim and I are basically the representatives from it. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve had other people be involved in it. The time blurs; I just don&#8217;t remember. I was out doing some demonstrating for different things. We did some stuff at various businesses. The most interesting was when we were downtown at Kimberly-Clark, and I don&#8217;t remember what the issue was at this point with Kimberly-Clark and the way they were treating employees, but we were down across the street from them; I guess there was a group of about twelve of us or so. I don&#8217;t remember, twelve, fifteen people, and we were doing skits, talking about the issue. I wasn&#8217;t doing a skit; I was carrying a sign. They had people who were doing skits and they had people who were speaking. I guess they had a speaker system or something and people were speaking, but the guys from Kimberly-Clark were up on their ramparts with their guns.
DC: Oh, really?
KR: I think they had rifles; I don&#8217;t remember. But they were there and we thought that&#8217;s interesting. I didn&#8217;t get really scared, but you know, it was really weird. Then I thought God, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m in the United States of America.
DC: Yeah, didn&#8217;t seem like it, yeah.
KR: Right, with people up there with rifles, but I don&#8217;t know why they were that threatened because we didn&#8217;t seem to be doing anything and we were following the law. We always followed the law about where you can be and where you can&#8217;t be, and we&#8217;re not trying to get ourselves arrested or anything like that. So we were on the other side of the street on the sidewalk where we were allowed to be. I mean, that was okay. I don&#8217;t remember any Knoxville police people coming along and telling us to do anything. I guess occasionally, we were out in front of Fred&#8217;s demonstrating. Fred&#8217;s had a lot of bad practices, and I was sorry because they were from Mississippi. [Laughter]
DC: What&#8217;s Fred&#8217;s? I&#8217;m unfamiliar.
KR: It&#8217;s a discount store.
DC: Okay.
KR: But their parent store was in Mississippi. But anyway, I think Fred&#8217;s called the police on us, but they couldn&#8217;t do anything because we weren&#8217;t doing anything. They weren&#8217;t going to arrest us; they might have told us &#8220;well, be sure you stay over there.&#8221;
DC: Right.
KR: So I&#8217;ve been involved in a few of those. I was out in front of Methodist Hospital when they were doing their salary and contract negotiations last year as a representative for Jobs with Justice. They had all these people out there, the nurses and the other people from the hospital talking about that, so I&#8217;ve been involved in that, and then they asked me and another person if we would be co-conveners of Jobs with Justice. So I did that for, gosh, seven or eight years--six, seven years; I don&#8217;t remember. Jim might know better than I do, but he&#8217;s the one who basically recruited me for that. So I kind of got us through a period and we were involved in the living wage campaign and we had other people who really did that. I didn&#8217;t really do that, and my leadership was more or less to convene the meetings and help with the phone bank and do things like that, which I did. This other guy and I kind of kept that going during a difficult time. It tends to blossom and flourish, depending on what we&#8217;re up to, and we&#8217;ve got really good leadership in it now. I went to their retreat planning session this year, because after I retired I thought okay, I&#8217;ve got time to go back to this, but I had to kind of leave it the last year because I&#8217;ve had a lot of medical problems. I just didn&#8217;t have the energy to do that while I was trying to finish and the last year I was at my church, after being at UT at the chaplaincy, I moved to St. Thomas church and I was there for about seven years, six, seven years, so while I was there I had all these medical things come up and I had to deal with that. But, I&#8217;m trying to get back into some of the other issues, and what I did at my church was to talk about the issues. Jobs with Justice has this Labor in the Pulpit Sunday, the closest Sunday to Labor Day, and I did--I mean, we&#8217;re not supposed to just pick up an issue and talk about it on Sunday. We&#8217;re supposed to follow the Lectionary and preach the gospel, but what I did was, I used some of the material that Jobs with Justice puts out and I had like a flyer and we had a litany that we could use to pray for workers of all sorts. So, I would include that with the prayers of the people, and then I would talk at the announcements and say, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got this information here&#8221; about, for instance, wage theft or unsafe practices. Jim wanted us to have a worker&#8217;s--what did we call that? A workers&#8217; hearing board, workers&#8217; rights hearing board? Anyway, it&#8217;s a hearing board, and he wanted that to be done. I could not get it done; I was out of steam by then physically. But he did; he set up a workers&#8217; board and I was on the first one we did, as somebody who was a listener and who would make comments and ask questions or whatever.
DC: What does a workers&#8217; board do?
KR: We ask somebody to come before us who&#8217;s had an unfair, unsafe situation and tell us about it, and then we can ask questions of the person; and then hopefully, we get some news coverage. That&#8217;s been very difficult to do, but we hopefully get some news coverage so that the situation is made apparent. While I was at Tyson House and at St. Thomas, we had a lot of stuff going on with the University of Tennessee and the way they were treating their housekeeping staff. I allowed and invited people to meet there at the center to have hearings on stuff--not a hearing board, but to have speakers talking about different issues that were going on. NAFTA was one we had, and we also had a place for the employees to meet to talk about what was going on with that housekeeping staff. We&#8217;ve had I don&#8217;t know how many now, half a dozen, maybe, workers&#8217; boards. We had one last year. We had one about Monterrey mushroom workers and we had a young woman there who talked to us about the fact that they were not allowed to go to the bathroom when they needed to go to the bathroom, and they were given knives that were not necessarily sharp, so they were more dangerous than if they had been correctly sharpened. If you complained, you got fired because there were ten more people they could hire that needed the jobs badly. A pregnant woman needed to change jobs and do something on a different line so that she was not having the same issues she had. I don&#8217;t remember whether it was standing and she could sit or whether it was a dangerous thing versus something else, but they wouldn&#8217;t let her change. She said, &#8220;Well, I know you need people.&#8221; They were actually advertising that they were hiring people for that other job instead of letting that employee transfer to a safer position because she was pregnant. There was all kind of crap going on, so anyway, we did hearings and got the word out, and were supportive and did various things. We also had a big deal with the workers in Morristown, Mexican by and large, workers over there at the plant there and we did a big deal with that. Fran could tell you at the time about that one because she was deeply involved in that one.
DC: Okay.
KR: But, you know, there&#8217;s just been different things that have come up. The living wage was a big one, and getting the workers (1:02:03) is--I don&#8217;t know that they gutted that, but I did do information and I had a couple at my church, at St. Thomas, one of whom works for TVA. Well, there&#8217;s a problem about conflict of interest stuff, you know, and that was difficult. Could she serve on a board? I tried to get the Episcopal Public Policy Network information out. You know, you can get this information yourself right off the computer. I had it and I disseminate a little bit of that, not so much, but not so much that--I did make people aware that some of these issues that the unions were talking about were real issues and deserved to have some attention, and they were not simply a bunch of people who were radically trying to get every cent for themselves. They were being treated unfairly and something should be done about it, and we as church people should be interested in doing something. I also had a member there whose spouse worked; still does; works as a social worker, and they saw false requests and they saw scams. I&#8217;ve seen people who come to the church who are seeking help and we did have a discretionary fund and we were known as a place that helped, and we did have a food ministry and we still do. So we&#8217;re aware of helping people; we&#8217;re also not stupid. We&#8217;re aware that sometimes you&#8217;re going to have to make a decision to give money or food to somebody that you don&#8217;t really believe is telling you the truth. But we try to avoid scams because it&#8217;s wasting money that somebody who really needs it could have.
DC: Right, right.
KR: So it&#8217;s very difficult. It&#8217;s a difficult situation, but that church is known for giving out food and we&#8217;ve always had a food pantry with another local church and we give out once-a-month food. We also have a freezer over there; they have a freezer over there, and we started keeping freezer food. Then sometimes a traveler would come by and they couldn&#8217;t take the frozen food or somebody without a place to live couldn&#8217;t take it.
DC: Right.
KR: But we sometimes had portable food, and sometimes I would just say to somebody on the road: &#8220;I can&#8217;t give you any money.&#8221; We could give gas money; we did that. But I could take food out of the freezer and heat it up and feed them right then. You know, how many people have you got in the choir? Well, we did barbecue meat for our big fall money-raiser and I would just say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got really good barbecue in here and we&#8217;ve got buns; I can heat this up for you and you can have a couple of sandwiches, and we might have something else in the freezer we could heat up.&#8221; Or we would have the ever-present peanut butter--you know, sandwiches, but it&#8217;s food. So we could sometimes do that and other times we could hand out canned goods. We didn&#8217;t do a lot with that except once a month, but we had a little pantry that we would feed. So now we&#8217;ve got a garden; we started a garden at that church.
DC: Yeah.
KR: We haven&#8217;t really gone all out with giving it to the neighbors, but some of our own members who are low on fixed income and other people out of work temporarily that garden--we had tons of tomatoes last summer. That was the first year we&#8217;ve done it, and basically had three or four gardeners and they just thought what a good idea and they got in there and did it. I didn&#8217;t do a thing, except to say, &#8220;You know, this could be an option for a Sunday School program,&#8221; and they said, &#8220;Do we have to do it during Sunday School?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So they got together the first time we had that offering, they went out there and set the boundaries of the garden and decided what they could plant and they just, by God, did it. We had corn and a ton of tomatoes, different kinds, two kinds of beans; something happened; I think the bugs got into the squash, but we had squash anyway. They got that under control and had squash. We had a whole bunch of zinnias that we used for cut flowers for the church.
DC: Nice, yeah.
KR: Yeah, now this year they expanded it and it&#8217;s already planted and it&#8217;s already coming up. Last year we told the neighbors &#8220;come and get the tomatoes.&#8221; People that live along the street, in other words, we just said, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ve got a lot of tomatoes,&#8221; and somebody would ask us &#8220;can we come get them?&#8221; because they would see them over there. You know, there at the end we couldn&#8217;t pick them fast enough.
DC: Right.
KR: We&#8217;ve always taken stuff into the parish hall and said after church &#8220;take home what you want.&#8221; So, I think they&#8217;re going to try--I&#8217;m not there any more--they&#8217;re going to try to make sure that the community knows it&#8217;s there and the church across the street that&#8217;s Methodist has this Angel of Food Ministries thing that they do. I think we tried to tell them &#8220;if you want fresh produce, you can give it out to the people when they come and get their Angel of Food Ministry&#8221;--most of that is frozen and you get one box of fresh stuff maybe, so I think we tried to tell them. The problem with that is that it&#8217;s just once a month, the food delivery, and here, the tomatoes come in.
DC: Right, right.
KR: But they expanded it and a lot of churches now are doing gardens, so a big feeding ministry there. Now I&#8217;m associated with the black, primarily black church, St. Luke&#8217;s, and we&#8217;re dealing, of course, with all kinds of social issues like there&#8217;s a park right directly across the street, but it used to be more difficult than it is--drug dealers were over there. One of the members who&#8217;s been there a long time said when he was growing up in that neighborhood, they had a summer program where they had paid staff and they would have games and crafts and arts and probably refreshments, I don&#8217;t know, but that&#8217;s long gone. Then they have a neighborhood association that had a meeting at the church with the new priest that&#8217;s there. I&#8217;m not their rector; I&#8217;m the associate. But, since he&#8217;s come they had a meeting there and talked about neighborhood issues with the representative from the city, who&#8217;s in charge of neighborhood stuff.
DC: Right.
KR: So they did that and they continue to try to minister with a week of Bible School for neighborhood kids, and most of those are not members of the church. They&#8217;re just neighborhood kids who come in. They have a feeding pantry Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and while they&#8217;re there, one of the people coming over there said, &#8220;You know, I could cut hair while people are waiting for their food.&#8221;
DC: How nice.
KR: So he&#8217;s doing haircuts; anybody that wants a haircut gets a haircut, then they get their food. There&#8217;s a whole pile of ministries that that church has just now brainstormed, and so the question is--it&#8217;s very small; they have about thirty on Sunday, about like St. Thomas where I was.
DC: Right.
KR: But we did tremendous amounts of outreach with thirty-five people or so.
DC: Right, right.
KR: This little church, St. Luke&#8217;s, can do the same thing, so now they have to figure out what they&#8217;re going to be able to do in terms of outreach to the community, which is largely the black community.
DC: Are they trying to get the recreation programs going again?
KR: I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know, but this is one of the things they brought up. You know, that park needs help, and it needs the possibility for doing stuff, but they have a whole long list of stuff they would like to do in the community. Of course, with thirty-five people, you&#8217;re not going to do them all, so you have to choose like we did at St. Thomas. Okay, the garden was easy. It was like a no-brainer.
DC: Where are these churches? Are these downtown churches or neighborhood?
KR: No, they&#8217;re suburban churches.
DC: Okay.
KR: Yeah, St. Luke&#8217;s is on Chestnut Street, which is off of Magnolia, which is in the east part of town. St. Thomas is in the northwest part of town--called Norwood area, and it&#8217;s just a couple of blocks off of the intersection of Merchant Road and Clinton Highway. If you get off the freeway, take the exit for Merchant Road, you cross Clinton Highway and about two blocks down, there it is.
DC: Okay. I actually know where that is.
KR: Well, it has this huge yard, and so we said we&#8217;ve got room for a garden, so we did it. So anyway, that&#8217;s kind of where I am, and I did not give you this bit of information: when I was growing up, my father was a laundry plant manager for the laundry. The laundry was about two blocks from where we lived because we were at the end of the street that was a major artery right downtown, and the laundry was over here, so my father could walk to work. He did, and he was the plant manager, and he basically worked ungodly hours forever until he finally said, &#8220;Wow, I can&#8217;t do this any more.&#8221; You know, he would have to get down there and get the boiler going for the hot water and stuff, but as he got older, he was the secretary-treasurer of the laundry workers union, so he was the one who would have to make sure that people got their insurance money or they got their insurance payment or that they turned in what they were supposed to, paid their laundry worker&#8217;s dues and all that. But, what I learned growing up was that when the contracts were at an end, certain of the laundry owners, not all of them, but certain ones would simply cut back the salary because they weren&#8217;t under the contract, so people were still doing the same work they had been doing, but they were getting paid less, which burned my father up. My father was very racist, but I mean he knew right and wrong, and he would get really ticked because here were these people not treating people fairly. He was the one who was having to try to help negotiate and get the contract and all that, and of course, then they&#8217;d get the contract and then they would have to pay them what they were supposed to pay them. You know, I saw a lot of that stuff growing up and I knew what my father did. Even though he was racist, he was making sure that those black people got treated like they were supposed to be. One of his favorite things was &#8220;me and the rest of the niggers.&#8221;
DC: Right.
KR: You know? &#8216;Cause he was seeing what was going on. I was very aware of some of this stuff, and even though I grew up in a very segregated situation, I would go to the laundry and sit and talk and play sometimes, where I could be without disturbing the work that was going on, mostly where they were marking clothes. I could be out of the way and play jacks or read my book, or occasionally get to ride in the laundry cart or get to go down the laundry chute into a laundry cart full of clothes.
DC: Sounds like fun.
KR: So anyway, but I was around black people and white people, and my father was respected because he treated people right, even though he had this built-in prejudice. I mean, he simply was not going to fold about issues and so he really did work hard to try to make sure people got what they were supposed to. Well, what else do you want?
DC: Well, let&#8217;s end by sort of coming back to this sort of framework that I told you about. We&#8217;re here looking at female leaders in women&#8217;s activism and&#8230;
KR: &#8230;Well, I left out the biggie that I didn&#8217;t think about.
DC: Okay.
KR: That was working in the (1:14:45) Program at Berea College one summer. I could be out in the field on weekends. That was another education which I was really in need of.
DC: The (1:15:05) Program?
KR: Yeah. You know about (1:15:07)? I think I mentioned that to you.
DC: Tell me about that.
KR: It&#8217;s a consortium of seminaries that has a program for clergy of all different denominations, works out of Berea. They&#8217;re active this summer. [Pause] But, one summer I did that program and I think it was four weeks--four weeks or six weeks, [pause] and we were bombarded with educational materials and reading that we had to do. It was a heavy program. [Pause] But, on weekends we had a placement. My placement was Crank&#8217;s Creek in Harlan County. We went to the Pentecostal church with the family that we stayed with. That was their church down the road a piece. She took us to a house, a lovely little rural--all the little houses were really nice on the roads until we got back into the back of that area. There was a house that looked like this. I could have brought you pictures. You wondered when it was going to fall over.
DC: Just leaning right over? Yeah.
KR: And that house had no paint. In that house lived an elderly woman and her mentally disabled daughter--adult. The other daughter and her husband lived in an apartment building somewhere around there. They basically got their welfare checks and spent it on themselves, and the mother and the daughter lived in this place that was falling down. I think it had an outside [pause] toilet. I don&#8217;t think the one inside worked. Their sheets were really kind of gray. I don&#8217;t know whether the other daughter and the son-in-law brought food over for them, or whether they cooked what they had, but I was gray myself when I got back from that experience with the person who took us over there. We were just sort of in shock that people could actually live like that. Crank&#8217;s Creek Center provided little seedling plants, you know, seed, and food, which they could get in, but that&#8217;s where I saw the reason why the diet is so bad for a lot of people. But they were trying to get them plants that they could plant in their gardens and get them decent food. They had clothing and they had donated food, but a lot of it was just basically starch and sugar, so they were trying to (1:18:25). They built a little building so that they could house people that could come, and they were one of the places that (1:18:35) would put people, so we had kind of an upstairs bedroom that three us women in the seminary shared for the time we were there. Of course, we talked with Becky and she talked to us about--. Becky Thompson, there&#8217;s a film, which I&#8217;ve got to return to Highlander about including her in part of the film. She went to Washington and talked about how the clear cutting and the stuff that was being done, and of course the mining had damaged the property and all that, so the place is dedicated to this elderly woman who was killed when one of the sludge ponds finally--the dam broke, and it washed over her house. They found her in there under the mattress where she tried to protect herself. You know, she herself and her children, I think, were caught in a flood because of the mining and the clear cutting, so now there&#8217;s nothing to stop the flooding, so flooding is much more rampant than it used to be, and she and her kids were caught on the fence in her property and managed to survive, but [Recorder turned off and back on] she went to Washington and lobbied it, and she managed to get a million dollars for Kentucky, which immediately went into all the politician&#8217;s pockets and very little of it got to help people. So this is where we were staying, and so we were hearing and learning about practical stuff, about the issues going on there. So that was another mind-changing experience, to really be there and to see the effects, because I grew up--. My father never earned over probably thirty-five-hundred dollars in a year, but we had food and we had a place to live and we were kind of upper-lower class or lower middle class in terms of--you know, and I got my education. Have you read the book about the guy from Louisiana who grew up on the streets after a while? Oh, what&#8217;s the name of that? He was here in Knoxville along with the white guy that befriended him. Aw, shoot! What&#8217;s the name of that? [Pause] Well, anyway, I was growing up in Louisiana at my little white school, and at the same time I was doing that, this guy was working on a farm and never did get to go to school hardly at all in Louisiana. But that was another eye-opener, reading that book only last year or so because I grew up and--ta-da! Everything was there for me. I mean, my mother got a legislative scholarship and they saved money, and they had bonds and I went to LSU. She had to pay quarterly, but it was about a thousand dollars a year and that included everything, plus a little allowance. That was when I was going there; it was in the late fifties, early sixties, and they could do that.
DC: Right.
KR: You know, I had a clarinet; they bought me a good clarinet. I was the only person that ever traded in three when it came time to trade. And my mother made my clothes, but here are these people living in dire poverty and they&#8217;re not being allowed to go to school. They&#8217;re being cheated because they&#8217;re doing, basically, sharecropping.
DC: Right.
KR: I mean, that&#8217;s still happening! You know, my best friend here is from Louisiana too, and I didn&#8217;t know all that growing up. I didn&#8217;t have a clue [pause]. But he knew and he knows still that stuff still happens. People are basically robbed of any chance of education and of any chance of ever getting any land for themselves, by and large. So, this stuff still goes on and I&#8217;m still appalled at it. I&#8217;ve done very little to do anything about it, but in some ways we&#8217;ve helped make it known to people and we&#8217;ve promoted people who are talking about the issues. We&#8217;ve tried to do some education about it and what we can in some other ways, like scholarships and help for the homeless. I&#8217;ve been kind of basically helpful simply by being aware and making my little donations to the Volunteer Ministry Center here who is working on homeless issues. But, that year, that summer that I went to the Appalachian Studies Program was a real, real blow upside the head to wake me up.
DC: Sounds like it, yeah.
KR: And I did not grow up rural; I grew up city.
DC: Right. And by just briefly talking about the women&#8217;s movement, was that something that you were aware of or a part of in the early seventies?
KR: No, not particularly, except that when I got to seminary that&#8217;s really where my education began, you know, in the late eighties, [pause] because some of the people I loved best just didn&#8217;t have a clue and were not involved in the language issues. Some of them were real, real resistant to that and it just never occurred to them. One of my friends still talks about dealing with &#8220;something, something&#8221; man rather than talking about mankind or human beings or people. You know, that language has never changed, because that education missed a couple of generations. I mean, we had it in seminary and we read the stuff, and I&#8217;ve got the books on different kinds of language. I&#8217;ve done the teaching about it, and in preaching, I use fewer pronouns or male pronouns and it makes it really awkward sometimes to talk about &#8220;well, you do understand that God expects God&#8217;s people to be able to do God&#8217;s work.
DC: Right.
KR: So you&#8217;re handing out something--God, God, God, God, God.
DC: Right.
KR: I told Inquirer&#8217;s Class last week: &#8220;Well, you know, the race stuff changes in the prayer book because people have figured out that they&#8217;re making these changes, and then when the prayer book revisers come along and then it changes. So right now in church at the opening part, one of the sentences comes out [pause] after you&#8217;ve said &#8220;Let us praise God,&#8221; then &#8220;it is right to give him thanks and praise&#8221; is what it says in the book, and in many, many places and including St. Luke&#8217;s, you&#8217;ll hear &#8220;it is right to give God thanks and praise.&#8221; So in the next prayer book, if that&#8217;s not in there I&#8217;ll be amazed.
DC: Right.
KR: I expect that change to be.
DC: That comes from the people, yeah.
KR: It does, you know. Changes do come from the people. So, [laughter] there you are, but my real knowledge of the women&#8217;s issues did not really come until seminary. I grew up thinking if you said &#8220;doctor&#8221; my immediate picture was a male person. If you said &#8220;lawyer&#8221; it was a male person. Certainly, a firefighter.
DC: Right.
KR: I was very interested in doing when I was growing up--one of the things I would liked to have been was a fire warden, out in those towers, you know? Well, I would really never have been able to do that, but that was one of the models, but there weren&#8217;t any women. I wanted to be in the Civil Air Patrol; there weren&#8217;t any women. I couldn&#8217;t be a Civil Air--. I wanted to be a ham radio operator and I didn&#8217;t get the support I needed or help I needed to pursue that. I still am going to get that. Honest to God, I&#8217;m going to do it.
DC: [Laughter]
KR: One of the people at St. Luke&#8217;s is an avid ham person&#8230;
DC: &#8230;That&#8217;s cool&#8230;
KR: &#8230;and he&#8217;s an examiner. But you know, there weren&#8217;t--there were all guys; there weren&#8217;t any women around doing that.
DC: Right.
KR: So I didn&#8217;t get the help I needed and my father did have ideas about what men and women should do, although I got to do a lot of what would be called tomboy stuff. I mean, I rode a bicycle all over town when I was a kid, but [laughter] my   thoughts--I still have trouble if somebody says &#8220;Dr. So-and-So&#8221;; I&#8217;m still likely to think male person. And I have a fine female dentist, and I&#8217;ve had a couple other people who were medical people, and my lawyer is a woman, but I didn&#8217;t grow up with those possibilities. I mean, that&#8217;s a long time ago.
DC: Right.
KR: It just wasn&#8217;t there.
DC: Right, and yeah, you&#8217;ve seen this enormous change in the church itself.
KR: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I was here and in Knoxville at St. Thomas when Katharine Jefferts Schori was chosen presiding bishop of the whole blessed church, which was amazing. We were just all astonished--didn&#8217;t believe it. And she is a brilliant woman--brilliant, but also extremely pastoral woman. There is not an ounce in her of egotistical crap. It just is not there.
DC: Right.
KR: So she is just a remarkable person and the people who were working with those issues knew that, and she got elected very quickly. It was not long and drawn out, but everybody was just amazed. So I&#8217;ve been there for the first bishop, female bishop; I was there when the first female priests were chosen; and I&#8217;ve been to seminary when we were definitely in a minority, and now they&#8217;re not the minority. So I&#8217;ve been living long enough to have seen all those changes. Now there are terrifically good women who were chosen to be at Oxford, Mississippi as a chaplain, which wouldn&#8217;t have happened when I was there. It was not going to happen. I went to England a couple or three summers ago, I guess it was now, and they had women on the staff at Canterbury. You know, amazing.
DC: Right.
KR: But when I was in seminary in the eighties, Liz Canham came over here to go to seminary because it was just not going to happen in England at the time&#8230;
DC: &#8230;That&#8217;s a shame&#8230;
KR: &#8230;when she became a priest.
DC: Right.
KR: Of course, now they&#8217;re talking about women bishops. So yeah, there&#8217;s been a whole lot of change in my lifetime.
DC: Now sexuality issues are the big--.
KR: Oh, yeah, and that&#8217;s going to be harder&#8230;
DC: &#8230;A lot of contention, yeah&#8230;
KR: &#8230;in a lot of ways because, well, the research tells you that little bitty children can tell a difference between men and women. You know, little bitty children react differently to men and to women, and you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Okay&#8221;, and we want to know, &#8220;Is that a man? Is that a woman?&#8221; When somebody doesn&#8217;t fit the mold--. I remember when I was doing public school, the kids would say sometimes--it got to a point there where we were finally allowed to wear pantsuits, and the kids would want to know, &#8220;Are you a man or are you a woman?&#8221; because I have a low voice and I was wearing a pantsuit.
DC: Right.
KR: We had a kid that showed up at a camp I worked with a long time ago who we didn&#8217;t know; the staff, we said, &#8220;Is that a boy or is that a girl?&#8221; because we weren&#8217;t in cabins or living in dorms, so we didn&#8217;t know. We were the adult staff and we puzzled over that for several days until we finally asked somebody, &#8220;Where are they living?&#8221;
DC: Right.
KR: I mean, you can&#8217;t seem to know what to do with people unless you can say that&#8217;s a man or a woman. Or, "Is that person gay?&#8221; I just kind of need to know that. It seems to be such a--.
DC: People, yeah, will--.
KR: You know, you&#8217;ve just got to know, and of course, some cultures do better than we do. I think--what is it? Oh, shoot! One of the island cultures, where people tend to be honored if they&#8217;re gay, and they tend to be shamans or--.
DC: I&#8217;ve read about that, yeah.
KR: But we just have such problems. When I grew up in high school, I had a guy that was helping out with the band stuff and he was gay as he could be, and he was definitely not accepted at all, but he and I were friends. Then I had another friend in college when I was in undergrad school--two friends that were gay guys. Nobody even talked about lesbians when I was in college. Somebody even mentioned something about somebody thought that so-and-so was in the music department, but I never knew who that was. I mean, you just did not talk about it, but I just always had friends. And there again, you know, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t like gay people, but I like Charlie,&#8221; you know?
DC: Right.
KR: And I didn&#8217;t have any feelings about it; it was just something unknown. Then of course, nothing was blatant. I had a friend in high school and nothing was blatant when I was in college, but then, in college, the gay guys got to going to a gay bar outside of Baton Rouge, and they would get raided because they were gay, not because they were doing anything illegal. So two of the guys who I knew in college were arrested, and of course, they got their names in the paper. While I was in seminary, we had a guy who was a seminarian and his work was being a dormitory monitor at the school at St. Andrews. He got accused by an emotionally screwed-up kid of doing something he shouldn&#8217;t have done, and he basically--his picture was in the paper. You know, we were all just aghast. He was absolutely--sworn and adamant that this did not happen, but I mean, the damage that this was causing. Finally, the kid said it had all been a passel of lies but by that time, that was, what, months later?
DC: Right.
KR: And this persons life is basically really messed up.
DC: Right.
KR: So I&#8217;ve been aware of all kinds of stuff, you know, being accused. I&#8217;ve seen people accused--we had somebody at Ohio State that was accused of doing some kind of gay action, sexual action on somebody else, and we were all just--ugh, we were ill, because he hadn&#8217;t.
DC: Right.
KR: We had another person at UT who was accused of doing something. It&#8217;s an easy target; just take somebody that you think is a little effeminate, if it&#8217;s a guy, and you know--. I ministered to a gal whose father thought that I was gay because I have a short haircut.
DC: Right.
KR: So, now what do you say? So my comment now is, if somebody thinks that I&#8217;m gay, which I&#8217;m not; but if they say that, I say, &#8220;Boy, that puts me in really good company,&#8221; and I start naming the people that I know that are openly gay who are leaders in our church, who are faithful, who are devout--probably pray more than I do every day, and you know, I say, &#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;m delighted to be put&#8230;.&#8221;
DC: &#8230;That&#8217;s a great answer&#8230;  KR: &#8230;into that company because I really admire so-and-so and so-and-so.&#8221; But we just have to--one, we have to categorize in order to be comfortable, apparently. Then, you know, we get easy targets so that we can deal with our fears, but I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re going to get out of this one. I don&#8217;t know. All I can do is to say--which I had to do when Gene Robinson was elected bishop--&#8220;Hey, folks, we&#8217;ve had positive increments toward acceptance of gay people and support of gay people and it&#8217;s going to happen, and it probably will happen at this convention,&#8221; and sure enough, it did. I tried to prepare people in my congregation, and then when it happened, we had a lot of upset and we lost two families eventually over it. One was definitely over it and the other one was more about the authority of scripture issue. You know, &#8220;I can pull up this verse of scripture, so that must mean something.&#8221;  DC: Right.  KR: That&#8217;s not where Episcopalians basically are, just not, that&#8217;s not there. That was very painful. We had to do a lot of work on that, and there are people now that I expect would be really upset if we decided that we had a right for gay unions in the prayer book, because they don&#8217;t want to be known as those people who have that.  DC: Is that under consideration?  KR: Well, yeah, we&#8217;ve been working on trying to get a right.
DC: Interesting.
KR: If you do one, if you believe it&#8217;s a right and you do one, you can make up something yourself, or you take one that&#8217;s come from some other tradition and adjust it and use it. That would be the next thing, to be able to actually publicly recognize a gay couple in the congregation and be able to do it. Now, the only way to do that is to have everybody in the clergy in that diocese agree to it. There&#8217;s all kinds of stuff, but no, you can&#8217;t do that if your bishop is not going to let you bless a gay union, you can&#8217;t do it. I can&#8217;t do it because our bishop doesn&#8217;t do that. But it is definitely an important issue. I can&#8217;t figure out what would happen after that though. Who are we going to pick on after that? We&#8217;ve already been through all the racial groups.
DC: Right, right.
KR: [Laughter] This is the biggie.
DC: This is it, yeah. Yeah, definitely for the Episcopal Church. Well, I think we&#8217;re good to end there.
KR: Okay.
DC: Thank you very much for your time. It&#8217;s been really interesting.
KR: You got an academic who&#8217;s also a clergy person; you got a talker.
DC: Yeah. [Laughter]
KR: You can&#8217;t shut them up.
DC: [Laughter]
