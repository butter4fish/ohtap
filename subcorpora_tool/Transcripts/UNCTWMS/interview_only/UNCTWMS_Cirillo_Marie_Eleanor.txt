David Cline: Today is May the 26th, 2010, and this is David Cline for the Southern Oral History Program.  I&#8217;m in--.  Are we in Eagan, or where are we?
Marie Cirillo: Eagan.
DC: We&#8217;re in Eagan.  I kept crossing the line so I wasn&#8217;t sure where I ended up. [Laughs] Eagan, Tennessee with Marie Cirillo, and if you would introduce yourself, when and where you were born, and we&#8217;ll start talking about your childhood.
MC: Okay.  So my name is Marie Cirillo.  I was born in Brooklyn, November 16, 1929, which was the year of the Depression, and I guess the month when it really hit.  And my parents: my father came from rural Italy when he was nine years old and my mother moved from rural Kentucky to Brooklyn when she was twenty.  And they were both musicians and they met at a music studio and when they got married they set up their home so that they could teach music, so you just have to imagine teaching music during the Depression and seeing their second child coming along and think, [Laughs] we&#8217;ve got one more mouth to feed. [Laughs] But part of that, we ended up having, you know, there were four girls in the family and we would end up mother packing up the kids and going to Kentucky in the summertime, so we always had that wonderful experience of rural America with grandparents who were very socially engaged in their little rural community.  Grandfather had a good garden and a cow and had pigs and grandmother and the kids did the weeding and the canning, [Laughs] and boxed up stuff to come back to Brooklyn.
So I grew up knowing where things came from, and it was interesting that my grandfather was also the little banker of, I guess it was a privately owned bank in this little community of five hundred people, so often there&#8217;d be people on the front porch sitting on the swing, getting advice from my grandfather.  Somehow I guess I&#8217;d like to think that I inherited something, [Laughs] understanding what cash is all about but also what the natural resources are as part of your economy.
DC: Right and that sense of community too.
MC: Yeah, that sense of community.
DC: Right.
MC: Yeah, so I got it at an early age.  And my father came from a rural mountainous area in Italy.  But at any rate, I grew up and I knew music and I think people identified my talents in a creative way because I remember Mother telling me maybe you&#8217;d like to be a landscape architect, so I must have worked in the garden and she must have seen something.  And then when I was nineteen I joined an order of nuns, the Glenmary Home Mission Sisters, because I wanted to work in rural America.  And it wasn&#8217;t long before they recognized my talent as an artist so it was a strange thing as I look back on it that I didn&#8217;t realize the gifts that I had.  I mean I was using them and people saw them and started using me for that, but I guess I didn&#8217;t have the drive to become a musician, even though two of my sisters were professional and still are professional musicians, and I didn&#8217;t have the drive to be an artist or a landscaper.  But I think I recognized my drive when after fourteen years working in rural places some of us sisters moved to some of the cities where they were migrating, and I was up in Chicago and I guess I got this same feeling that I used to have when I left Kentucky and went to New York, and I didn&#8217;t like Brooklyn.  I didn&#8217;t know where anything came from.  I didn&#8217;t know how the police got going, how the water system came in, and all that stuff.  So I spent four years in Chicago with these migrants and that was a time when three million people had migrated out of Appalachia.
DC: Was that your first--
MC: That was my first ex--.
DC: --posting, or--?
MC: No.  I was a Glenmary Sister for eighteen years,--
DC: Right.
MC: --and all of my years up until--.  Let&#8217;s see, I joined the convent in &#8217;47 and I moved to Chicago in &#8217;67.
DC: Okay, so you had spent quite a lot of time.
MC: Yes.  So I really felt this pain for the people who wanted to move back home and I saw the division between husband and wife sometimes where one wanted to stay in the city and one wanted to go back home.  And so in the year &#8217;67 that was, my fourth year in Chicago, was the year that the Glenmary Sisters for the most part broke up and we organized this group called the Federation of Communities in Service, and that&#8217;s when forty-four of us became lay people and came back to Appalachia.  Not the South in general; we decided to focus on Appalachia.
DC: And you were in Chicago at that time.
MC: No, I came back.  When I left the convent I came back.
DC: But while the decisions were being made--
MC: Yes, all of those decisions about the convent--
DC: --you were--.
MC: --I was in Chicago.
DC: Okay.
MC: Yeah.
DC: And did the sisters come from all over to work that out?
MC: Yeah, because we had sisters in Detroit and Cincinnati--those were the city places--and then we were in places in Georgia and Virginia and North Carolina, Hayesville, North Carolina.  I don&#8217;t know if you know that place?
DC: [06:10] actually.
MC: Yeah.  So when I was looking for a job after I became a member of FOCIS [Federation of Communities in Service], I was one of fourteen who came to Tennessee in search, and I found this place and I was fascinated by the idea that the population had dropped from thirty thousand to three thousand, and I thought, wow.  I&#8217;m going to stay here until I can find out why people can&#8217;t live here.  So I&#8217;m still here, and I&#8217;m still learning. [Laughs]
DC: Did you explore other communities?  How did you find Eagan?
MC: How did I find this place?
DC: Yeah.
MC: Oh, well actually we&#8217;ll show you the map of what we call the Clearfork Valley.  When I came here I lived in Clairfield at first and I lived in this little--.  It&#8217;s hard to find housing because the companies had torn the houses down and the only people that were here were people who had a home of their own, and probably one of the reasons they didn&#8217;t move was because they couldn&#8217;t afford to lose all their investment in their house.
DC: Right.
MC: Which, you know, now I come to appreciate their quality of being indigenous people, especially when all these scientists are trying to figure out how to heal the earth and take care of the water and to counteract the disadvantages [Laughs] of the coalmining, and I think these people need so much and if these scientists and indigenous people could just get their act together we might be able to grow a healthy community.  But they&#8217;re still too separate.  Anyway, I&#8217;m losing my train of thought.
DC: You were in Clairfield--.
MC: Oh.  I lived--.  The post office was in an old commissary building and half of it was like an apartment and the postmaster hadn&#8217;t let anybody live there because she didn&#8217;t want that annoyance, it was too close, but I ended up living there for awhile.  What happened was I had found out about this community that through the poverty program was getting some money to set up a community center and they were renovating an old school building and they would have money to hire somebody, so I applied for that job and she gave me that space.  The postmaster, she was the only public figure in the community and everybody saw her and she dealt with everybody&#8217;s problems, so she was really my mentor.
DC: Interesting.
MC: Now one of the things that happened though was that as different ones of us were looking for jobs we were trying to see if at least two of us could be close enough together, because having been used--
DC: For some support, right.
MC: --to living community life--yeah.  So one of the gals couldn&#8217;t find a job and she came to me.  She was looking in Kingsport and she said if there&#8217;s any way I could, you know, find a job there I could come live with you.  So I said to her, well, if they will give you this job I will go to the bishop and see if he would support me coming here.  And most of our sisters didn&#8217;t want to talk to any bishop because we had just left all of that. [Laughs]
DC: Right. [Laughs]
MC: But I thought I&#8217;m willing to take the chance.  So the bishop said yes and so Jean Luce and I were here together for about two years and she was running the poverty program, and between the two of us so much was happening that the county officials were getting really nervous about what was going on, so they kind of gracefully, or not so gracefully, pushed Jean out of her position, but by that time I felt comfortable enough to stay here by myself.  And at that time I was close to being forty and a lot of our people were thinking maybe they wanted to get married and have a family and I thought, well, I can&#8217;t learn any younger whether I can live by myself or not, [Laughs] because that might be what I&#8217;m called to if I stay here, so I decided I would stay and try it.  And before a couple of years passed I ended up with three other women at my house; they were former nuns. [Laughs] And then over time they left and then I got closer to the people and I feel pretty comfortable now.
DC: Right.
MC: There is one other former Glenmary Sister who is a FOCIS member, who used to live with me but when my house got raided during the strip mining time and [Laughs]--raided, I mean just by being shot into and being threatened and everything--
DC: Oh, boy, yeah.
MC: --one of the neighbors invited her to live in a house that was close to them that they weren&#8217;t using anymore, and she went there, and other people had advised me if I wanted to stay in the strip mine business I should probably move out of town.  I thought about moving out and I found another place in Petros, Tennessee, where people were looking for a house for me, but by the time they found something things had subsided here, so I just have stayed.
So, let&#8217;s see.  Where am I in my history?  I gave myself a title for what I thought I was doing, to the bishop, and I said I wanted to do community development, which in my mind was empowering the people to rebuild their community according to their own priorities.  The first ten years I was meeting people, getting advice from the postmaster, and helping to mobilize people that had common interests.  So the first thing that people in Clairfield wanted was a doctor.  They used to have a doctor in the coal camps and now these were mostly older people and they really needed some medical help.
DC: And where was the closest doctor, or was there any access?
MC: Well you know what&#8217;s interesting, the closest doctor--and this is an interesting story--was in Jellico, and that&#8217;s about seventeen, eighteen miles from here.  Another doctor, the man had permission to function as a doctor until a regular doctor would come in.  Now this man learned how to be a doctor through his father who was a doctor, but because there was no professionally trained doctor he was able to--.  So he was the closest doctor.  Certainly in the past forty-two years that I&#8217;ve been here doctors have come in, and I think part of how even all of that happened had something to do with us organizing for rural clinics.  Linda Mashburn was the first one who came in and helped us and she helped--.  Well I started by helping this group to get their focus on what it would take and how they might, even though it was supported by the poverty program they might want to form their own independent nonprofit because the poverty program might not last forever. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: Which was true.  So while they had that center Linda Mashburn came and got these Presbyterian doctors and dentists from the Palisades, I remember, in New York, and they came and had a health fair.  Then the next summer we had attracted some Vanderbilt medical students who were from rural Mississippi and places so they weren&#8217;t satisfied with the education they were getting because they didn&#8217;t think that kind of medical training fit a rural community.
DC: What they wanted to do, right.
MC: So their help for several years--and it grew throughout the region--in organizing rural clinics was very helpful.  We had our first clinic and then other people came to me and said how can we have a clinic, and I said, well, talk to the people here, and then before you know it in this general area that I kind of claim as my area of influence, there were four clinics.  I should tell you, and I can show you a map, but as I came to understand Clairfield and where I was living and I looked on the map I could see that we had Pine Mountain that kind of kept us enclosed and Cumberland Mountain, and the only places out were Jellico and Caryville and Pineville, Kentucky, and Middlesboro, Kentucky, and the river that flowed through was the Clearfork, so I began to call this the Clearfork Valley and it&#8217;s parts of two counties in Tennessee and two in Kentucky.  So we&#8217;re on the other side of the track in a sense, [Laughs] from four different counties in two states, so we had no political power at all.  So I deliberately decided that I would not engage in activities in the towns because towns had units of government and this whole area had no unit of government so they had no voice about where tax monies could come to serve their priorities.
DC: Right.
MC: So starting the nonprofit thing empowered them.  And I always stayed with the group until they could find the staff they needed and could figure out some ways of running the board and knowing how to get money.
DC: Did these sort of disparate communities then start to see themselves as part of a whole?
MC: Yes, in fact at one point we had four little clinics that were run by volunteers and I tried to pull them together and I said, you know, you can&#8217;t last this way forever but maybe if you work together, so they tried to attract money and they were all too small but I said maybe if you work together, so they did start working together.  Then it was interesting how at some point some volunteer came into Henderson Settlement, which is in this area.  He was a young man and he came to do something, but then he got interested in these clinics so he came to visit me and I told him everything that I was doing and I opened the files and he studied the files.  Then he decided that I was working to overtake these people so he turned all these clinic people against me.  So you know, I thought he&#8217;s just the kind of guy that wanted to find the enemy and find it so I just let him take it and I just started working then more intensely with this other group that was the Model Valley Development Corporation, and that&#8217;s the group where this older man is still coming up two days a week, and the other people that are key to it really have been with it right from the beginning so they are at--I&#8217;m jumping a little bit in terms of history--but they are at a point now where I am, that we have to figure out in a very serious way how to transition us to younger people.  And this where it-- It just dawned on me about a week ago--that&#8217;s how long it takes for things to unfold--but where I really thought the way to organize central Appalachia, because most of the people live in these hinterland areas, would be for them to start their nonprofits and then you figure out how this all works together and how important the land and the water and the air and all that are to this thing.
DC: How it&#8217;s all connected, right.
MC: You have your basic elements, you have the things that live on the earth, you have the groups trying to do things relating to the resources they have, so I thought just start these nonprofits because you all live outside of incorporated towns.  But then I realized the other day with this&#8212;that we were pleased with the nonprofits because we could find the good people--it&#8217;s not a political thing--but now we don&#8217;t know how to gracefully--.  We don&#8217;t have a system for transferring this stuff.
DC: And sort of the next generation hasn&#8217;t organically emerged?
MC: Well and part of it is because we&#8217;ve never had money, and people think they have to get money to--.  These poor kids, they don&#8217;t have a decent house to live in, you know they have their girlfriends and how can they ever get married if they don&#8217;t have a place to settle down, and you know, they love what we&#8217;re doing but they need a little something to live on, so nobody that has the money has recognized this kind of movement sufficiently to give them the security they need, and whether we could ever transform the governments somehow of the regions or the counties to find a way--.  And I know some states have townships and I don&#8217;t understand what they are, but whatever that is it seems like it gathers up more of these rural kinds of places.  I&#8217;m not sure what kind of governmental system could be in a shape that the counties would accept and we could share some of the monies to keep some of our priorities going, so that&#8217;s the latest thing that I have learned after forty-two years of living here, [Laughs] and eighteen years more of being in--yeah.
DC: So how do you--?
MC: But you know in terms of how my--.  I do, before I leave home, and even though I didn&#8217;t care for Brooklyn as a place to live forever because of the reasons I stated, the one thing about my Catholic education in high school was that they really taught us the social teachings of the Church.  We had a really good grounding in the social teachings and later on I came to appreciate that because sometimes the objection I have to having all your faith on the Bible is the fact that people think that&#8217;s the truth, the only truth, and nobody else can add truth, and it gets you stuck somehow.  I saw those social teachings because they came from the popes somehow they were legitimate [Laughs] and broke that barrier.  And I think a lot of the Catholics--.  And I worry about the church now because I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re still teaching that, but maybe something else is.  Maybe this whole environmental thing is teaching us to get back to another kind of religion--
DC: It might be.
MC: --or more primitive religion where you saw God&#8217;s creation as--yeah.  So who knows where religion&#8217;s going.  But that was important to me, and as a high school kid they had this--what did they call it?--the Catholic Youth something or another, but, Lord, I was part of that and I&#8217;d go to these meetings and we&#8217;d do these things together in our neighborhoods.  Catholic Action--.  The name might come to me, but I can&#8217;t think of it right now.  I think that started with some priest up in Canada and kind of got down here.
DC: And there was--.  I&#8217;m just thinking that in the inner cities too there was obviously--and Chicago--the work was all done through the churches.
MC: Churches, yeah.
DC: I have so many questions, but one is: in an area in which there are so many needs and issues and you can see them as being interrelated, how do you prioritize?  You mentioned basically taking ten years to get to know the community.  How do you prepare yourself to be patient for the long haul?
MC: Well I think if outsiders can&#8217;t be patient, then recognize the indigenous people.  Because I said to my church a long time ago, I said I could leave that area if you would give your monies to some of the people in the community.  When we had the Commission on Religion in Appalachia in the early years I used to say to them, if you&#8217;re giving monies to this group kind of constantly it&#8217;s because you identify somehow.  Why don&#8217;t you find somebody there that you can endow some kind of ministry [laughs] on them?  It doesn&#8217;t have to be an outsider.  But it&#8217;s just a long haul for people that have made it well in urban areas and you get your degrees and you get your jobs and you have all these wonderful things to realize that they&#8217;ve lost touch with the earth that supplies the real wealth that can make your money.  You&#8217;re so disconnected from those things, and we have had such a disrespect for people who get their hands dirty in the earth that it&#8217;s going to take--.  I don&#8217;t know what kind of blinds we have on us that we can&#8217;t see the importance of the wisdom and knowledge of people who know the earth, and that&#8217;s why it would be important for you to talk to Carol.  Some people call her Crazy Carol because she&#8217;s so out of it but so sure of her--you know, in terms of what people do to make it right--and she&#8217;s so sure of herself.  Some people wonder why I put up with her, because she seems scattered.  Well she does have a hard time focusing because these things just keep bubbling up in her mind.  She&#8217;s forever moving around. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: But she&#8217;s the one, in her moving around, some of the most valued people who have worked in an orderly manner have been found by her.  She finds them and says, &#8220;Marie, you got to meet this person,&#8221; and then another group finds them and hires them or takes them on, and it&#8217;s kind of--.  And now this group of young people that I have, she decided I think just for her own healing, because she gets involved and gets bounced around and conflicts are hard, you know, that kind of bruises, [Laughs] but she&#8217;s found a lot of peace in the mountains.  I think she started with digging ginseng and then she got interested in yellowroot and then she got interested in medicinal healing and I think realizing how the forests were healing her and how these roots--she could pass on a healing kind of thing.  Well in her doing that she would make a little bit of money and she had this peace of mind, and she found these boys who were restless and hopeless and whatever and she&#8217;d take them with her and they were protection for her and they got excited about this.  So now they&#8217;ve got this little co-op, and Michelle, and they&#8217;re all part of this co-op thing.
DC: Wow, that&#8217;s really interesting.
MC: Yeah.  And now I&#8217;m trying--.  And she used to live on the land trust and she built one of the first houses out of native materials because we thought, heck, if nobody will give us a mortgage because we don&#8217;t have enough money but we know how to get hold of a tree and how to saw it and how to be patient and let it dry and build what we can and add to it as we can.  And then as a land trust we thought well why don&#8217;t we learn from people as they&#8217;re doing this so we can get a system?  So we got a wonderful grant a couple years ago from the Self Development of People, the Presbyterian program, which gave us monies to build two native material houses, and we hired one person to sort of organize the thing, the process, and we gave grants to these two families and we said now your payment back for us is not money but you have to tell us how you&#8217;re doing it.
DC: How you did it, right.
MC: So from month to month they&#8217;d tell us how they found the trees, who they negotiated with for the sawing, how they got their sand, how they swapped car work for electric work, and they were different.  They both went different routes.  But we just didn&#8217;t have enough support, no financial basis to keep something like that going.
DC: Right.
MC: So then you know you fall into not doing anything until you can work through the state to get THDA monies and every year the fund keeps getting more expensive and more expensive and people keep getting more and more into drugs because they can&#8217;t get anything done.  It&#8217;s still a pretty vicious circle, but we keep--. [Sighs] I think the place--.  I&#8217;m jumping now, but the place where I am now, having moved from ten years of just responding to anything people wanted--.  Oh, hold that and help me remember where I left it. [Laughs] But when I first came here one of my questions to these older people was, how come you lost all those people?  And I know when I was in Chicago and I was going to Loyola and I finally found a teacher who would let me do field work in this neighborhood I had some understanding of how to get questions asked that can get us the right response.  In school I&#8217;d be searching for answers from the teachers or from the social workers or the industries and they had their answers that just didn&#8217;t make sense to me, but when I came here I remember the people saying that the biggest reason they couldn&#8217;t do anything was because the companies owned all the land.
DC: Right.
MC: So then I said to them, well what can we do about it, and they didn&#8217;t know and I didn&#8217;t know.  I mean I graduated, [Laughs] but that didn&#8217;t teach me how to deal with that issue, and I think it&#8217;s the best held secret by corporations, right?  I mean they don&#8217;t teach this in school. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: But anyway, they didn&#8217;t know what to do and I didn&#8217;t know what to do so I said, well, let&#8217;s just start with what you think you can do.  Well they wanted this clinic so I was willing to start with that.  I wouldn&#8217;t have cared if they wanted to start with music ventures.
DC: Right, so it&#8217;s what they wanted.
MC: I had to start with whatever they wanted to start and felt like they could do.
DC: Right.
MC: And it took a while for them to realize that I didn&#8217;t come with money, just a way to support what we could do together, because I guess they were waiting; maybe, maybe I&#8217;d come across with this million dollars--
DC: Right, satchels of money. [Laughs]
MC: --that could let them do this. [Laughs] But I think after they got to know me they realized.  Okay, then what I came to realize later was that some of the people who were most driven to want a clinic wanted that because several people, children particularly, had died from hepatitis because of the water, and they didn&#8217;t know what to do about the water problem so they were saying, well, let&#8217;s have a clinic so the doctors can--
DC: Treat.
MC: --keep us healthy.
DC: Right.
MC: Yeah, interesting.  So they knew the land was an issue, but this guy, he never really spoke openly about the water issue.  It took me awhile to put that together, that he really wanted the clinic because it was his only route.  So after ten years of clinics and craft groups and childcare centers and music groups, when group stuff got to the point were they needed a facility the group had to struggle with how to get a piece of land, so we began to have this collective experience and different experiences of what they could do and what they couldn&#8217;t do.
So then, like I came in &#8217;67; by 1977 I found a group willing to start a community land trust.  That was the first time I introduced an idea, and I had introduced this several years before and people said no, but in &#8217;77 there were huge floods all over this region so we&#8217;d start meeting regionally.  And people in West Virginia who had a stable home now didn&#8217;t have because they got flooded, and I remember the government brought all these trailers down and they were on the highway for over a week because they couldn&#8217;t find land to put it on, so that heightened the awareness of land.  We didn&#8217;t have that bad a flooding, but I came home all fired up about we need a community land trust, and I found some people at that moment--it wasn&#8217;t the first audience--people on Roses Creek who said, yeah, let&#8217;s try it.  We had a hard time getting it started because so many people that were living here were living on leased land from the company and it was a year by year thing.  We said, no, this is land that we&#8217;ll own collectively and you have a lifetime renewable lease to the piece that your house is on.
DC: So at that time the company was holding the land but not actively doing anything with the land, or with these pieces of it?
MC: Other than the mining.
DC: But they weren&#8217;t--they were still mining.
MC: They were mining and timbering.
DC: Okay.
MC: And they could do it better because there weren&#8217;t all those people in the way.
DC: Okay.
MC: Right?  So they didn&#8217;t really want people. [Laughs]
DC: Right, right.
MC: There was this one year--.  Oh, it&#8217;s interesting.  When I came here it was an English company that had owned it from 1988 to--no, 1888 to 1988, so I was here when it was sold, and it was sold to the Huber Company, J M Huber.  They own a lot of North Carolina land; maybe you know them.  And they had their headquarters in New Jersey.  They&#8217;re a family owned corporation and it wasn&#8217;t long before they were here because it was after all that strip mining activity, so maybe they were being nice to protect themselves but also I think they were being nice because their company encouraged them to be sensitive to the communities where they were.
DC: Had you ever--?
MC: So they did; they visited most of the nonprofit groups, actually.
DC: Had the previous owners ever visited?
MC: The English company?
DC: Yeah.
MC: No.
DC: Never.
MC: No, but now they had a--.  They were from England but they had a management director over in Middlesboro, Kentucky, so the first shock was when our clinic--.  The Clairfield people were willing to build a clinic.  They had found a doctor, they had a good board, they had a little bit of money, and they went to Middlesboro, all of them, the board and the doctor--I didn&#8217;t go--to see if the company--.  They had forty thousand acres and they were asked if they could sell them or lease them a half an acre and they said no, so I thought, this is unbelievable.  Okay, then the Model Valley Development Corporation, they had gotten to the point where they had everything in place to start a business.  They could have gotten a small business loan; they had the market; from their research they thought there was plenty of good hardwood in the area to build a good pallet, industrial wood pallets--.
DC: That&#8217;s what they were going to do.
MC: Yeah, that&#8217;s what they were going to do.  So, in looking to build the factory they went to the company and the company offered them a piece of land that had these huge piles of black slag and they said if you&#8217;d clean that up we&#8217;ll give you a five-year lease.  Well they came back--they were red with anger. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: Or white with anger, just livid.  You know, any day we&#8217;re going to clean up that trash and invest in something for--.
DC: Just to get a lease.
MC: You know, like, who do they think we are?
DC: Right.
MC: So anyway, they got the factory going and by golly the one who had done the research, even though he knew there was all that hardwood here, they didn&#8217;t think that maybe it was owned by the company and maybe the company would not let us cut the timber, and that&#8217;s exactly what happened.
DC: Right.
MC: Can you believe?
DC: Right.
MC: So they hung on.  They&#8217;d go to little owners and get a little wood here and there and most of the time they would have to close by noon because they&#8217;d run out of lumber.  And it was interesting; they only hired fourteen people but when they were ready to open--and didn&#8217;t realize the problem--they advertised locally but the word got up to the cities where people have moved and over seventy people applied for the jobs.
DC: Wow.  They wanted to come back.
MC: And this was for minimum wages, where they probably had something a little better in the cities, at least some of them.  So anyway, it was a couple of them that came back, in fact one of them that came back anyway, that was a real advocate of the community land trust, and until he died he was very--.
DC: So how did that work with the land trust?
MC: The land trust?
DC: Yeah.
MC: Well, it was a struggle for the first couple of years but we--.  And I stayed with them much longer than I stayed with these other groups because the others were more conventional things, and when we started this land trust I thought, well there are others out there we could get answers from, but we realized there weren&#8217;t many out there and they hadn&#8217;t figured out how to do it--
DC: How to do it either.
MC: --yet either, yeah.  So we were just stumbling over how to do it, but in that process we did this wonderful thing of--.  I realized--this is what I learned--that these people knew that land because they had walked it since childhood, the ins and outs, so when they got a piece of land they had some sense of what its assets were.  We also--and this was probably my doing--invited the university people to come, those that knew how to do landscaping, zoning, whatever, and they made their plan.  I remember they came up to one of our meetings and we had a round table and they had their professional looking maps, you know, and they were showing us what they thought could happen, and once the people understood what that map was saying they said, oh, yes, that&#8217;s what we thought, or, oh, no, that won&#8217;t work because of blah, blah, blah.  But together they figured out a plan.  Our people knew what it was all about so they had done their zoning.  They had done their zoning, and if the county came in to zone them they&#8217;d resist it furiously because it was other people doing zoning for them and not giving them an opportunity.
Then a couple of years ago the county people told me that they were giving some thought to zoning the rural areas, and I&#8217;m guessing that their incentive was that there are some rural areas that could be developed for second home kind of things, so they were going to start doing zoning.  I said to them--because they had never known how to deal with us.  They wanted us to register as a subdivision.  We said, no; we&#8217;re not a subdivision.  I mean, we had four hundred and fifty acres in different plots and only fifty of that is where residents can settle, and probably thirty of that is where their house is and where the roads have to go.  And I said the rest of it is all forest land that we have to depend on for sustaining it, for building our economy, for blah, blah, blah.
DC: Where--?
MC: So they didn&#8217;t know how to--.
DC: Right.
MC: So they finally gave up and then at one point when I heard they were going to zone I said, &#8220;What are you going to do with us?&#8221; and they said, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll probably grandfather you in; don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;  But that wasn&#8217;t good enough for me because--
DC: Yeah, you don&#8217;t want to hear that. [Laughs]
MC: --we want to be able to promote this kind.
DC: Right.
MC: And then about two years ago I finally got the nerve to ask the mayor of the county.  I said, &#8220;I wonder if you&#8217;d consider putting me on the county planning commission?&#8221; because they&#8217;re appointed by--and he just looked at me like, you know. [Laughs] Of course I thought I had shown myself enough that maybe they&#8217;d think of it and I finally thought well maybe I&#8217;d just better ask.
DC: But that didn&#8217;t work.
MC: Yeah.
DC: Yeah. [Laughs]  That land, did that come from--was that Huber?  Who had that land you acquired for the land trust?
MC: There were little pieces and we got them in different ways.
DC: Okay.
MC: The first piece they got--and it would be nice if you had time to really tour some of this--the first piece came from a local group who had tried to start a folk school.
DC: Okay, yeah.
MC: One family had given them fourteen acres of their personal lands, you know, one of their homes, and when that fell apart and it had sat idle for several years.  The woman who sold it was paying the taxes so I figured she thought maybe eventually it would come back to her, but when the land trust started she was interested in it.  I said, &#8220;Do you think your group would ever be willing to turn that piece of land over?&#8221;  So not only did they turn it over but she became one of the first board members.
DC: How nice, good.
MC: And she was basically second generation Native American.  She actually went to the school here when she was a child and she used to tell the stories of how the Native Americans and the black kids were not allowed to go to school, so she said when the other kids were in school that&#8217;s when we blacks and Natives went up into the mountains and explored and had fun together.  Interesting, huh?
DC: Yeah.
MC: Finally, she said, they decided to give [them] night classes, so they started having night classes for them.  But anyway, that&#8217;s all part of--and again that woman died just a few years ago but her son, who&#8217;s raising two boys, lives right next door to me now on the land trust, so it&#8217;s kind of nice.  But he has such a hard time living; struggling to keep his kids going and bringing up enough income.
But the Huber Company did want to give this school away and there was twelve acres that they were willing to let go of for anybody that would take the school, so we heard that they were doing this so we called them because they hadn&#8217;t approached us.  And they said well there&#8217;s several groups that are still interested it so they felt like they should give them priority.  So you wait another year and you hear nothing, and I call them up and they give the same answer.  So I thought who in the heck wants this building?  So I went to all these nonprofits and I said did they approach you, and they said, yes, but we told them we didn&#8217;t want it.  So I called them up again, [Laughs] and I said, hey, there&#8217;s nobody that wants that but we do.  So I said, come up and talk to us, or something.  So that was the first time we ever had some of these company people actually sit around the table at the Woodland office and talk to us face to face.  So what they said to us was--.  They seemed to appreciate what we were doing and were familiar enough with other of these nonprofits but they said we would be nervous about turning it over to you because the board would wonder why one land company is giving land to another land company, and I didn&#8217;t want to go through that again, the difference, you know, [42:35].
DC: Right.
MC: But anyway what they did decide was they would give it to the Model Valley Development Corporation who could then give it to us.
DC: Okay.
MC: Yeah.
DC: Right.
MC: So that&#8217;s what happened.
DC: Okay.
MC: So they turned it over to the land trust, and at that time the land trust had developed--.  Well they were learning how to get hold of land and how to get the money to pay for land and at the same time they were trying to find ways to help people build their homes or to build for them and help them get their mortgages.  They were playing around with that.  As this was happening one of the things that we realized was that now that we had land all of a sudden the local men could get excited: Here&#8217;s land; here&#8217;s a place we can build; there&#8217;s something for us to do and they could be proud of.  Where was I taking that? [Pause] Hmm.

DC: Land, buildings.
MC: I don&#8217;t know.  That was a sideline and I forgot what I was--.  But anyway, it was--.  Oh, I know.  We had primarily church groups at the time that used to send their kids up for mission experience, and as they were here we were so--.  They weren&#8217;t just repairing houses but they were helping with the gardens and they were helping with this, that, and the other thing.  We began to realize that we were teaching them something that was really important, so we established this living/learning center, and it wasn&#8217;t a physical center but it was a concept, and then when they got this place we decided we would make this the living/learning center.  Eventually what happened, because we were dealing with such different constituencies, we ended up dealing primarily with colleges and the housing people had to deal with these Tennessee housing people and banks for mortgages and the land people just had to be figuring out the whole answer [Laughs] to how to get land, that we decided to try to get three different boards so they could really keep that focus, but to work together.  So that&#8217;s why just a couple of years ago the land trust turned over this building to an all women&#8217;s group, because we--.  And I could go through--.  We have a history of over the years, the forty-two years that I&#8217;ve been here, of women trying to do something, so this could start me on my women&#8217;s--.
DC: Yeah.  Let&#8217;s talk about that.
MC: Okay, the first thing was that we had a number of women&#8217;s little nonprofits, even beyond this little valley, but in places in Kentucky and Tennessee where we could get to Jellico in about forty minutes.  So some of us who were running the centers knew each other but the grassroots women never knew each other.  Well anyway, one day I get a phone call from this gal up in Washington, Jane Threet, and she&#8217;s talking with all this enthusiasm about how she was trying to get rural women together for a meeting, this feminist women&#8217;s thing, and I&#8217;m thinking to myself, hey, that&#8217;s not where our women are.  You talk about women and activists, but feminist just doesn&#8217;t cut it here.  So I said--.
DC: Well why--?  I mean let&#8217;s just pull that out.  Why not?  Where were they?
MC: Well, I think there was an image of feminism as being these smart, urban, radical kind of people and rural mountain women didn&#8217;t identify with that kind of an aggressive--.  I mean, we might be aggressive but it&#8217;s very subtle, just as men [do], we have a different style of leadership.  I mean, a leader doesn&#8217;t become noticeable.  It kind of gets under your skin somehow, but--. [Laughs] So I haven&#8217;t quite identified all of that but they have a very subtle way of being a leader.
So at any rate I said no to her and then she called me again and I said no to her, that I really wasn&#8217;t going to make a trip to Washington to organize a national women&#8217;s thing, or to meet with women.  Well then other women from the mountains started calling me and saying, &#8220;Marie, are you getting this call from this Jane Threet?  Do you know who she is or what she is?&#8221;  And I said, no.  But then when Jane called me the third time I talked to her, because I thought she&#8217;s pretty smart to have known--how did she know how to get hold of these women?  And then as she talked to me she said she had planned this thing for ten days, and I said to myself, now that&#8217;s pretty smart, to call people from all over the country but then to hold us there for ten days.  We might get somewhere instead of just running ourselves to death.  So I went to this first meeting, and the other thing she had figured out was that she would get these agencies in Washington that had women&#8217;s departments, or that were oriented that way, to come to that meeting, and she made those people pay to carry one of us.
DC: Got it.
MC: And then she put us in dorms at this 4-H Club where we were interacting, so I thought, you know, this gal has something.
DC: This is about when?
MC: When? [Pause] Well it was after the land trust got started so it was after &#8217;77, but I&#8217;d have to check.  I might find something--we can check that.
DC: Okay.
MC: I don&#8217;t really know.
DC: The late &#8217;70s.
MC: Yeah.  So anyway, after this first meeting one of the things I realized at the meeting was that in terms of--.  She got mostly women who were engaged in development kind of work and that where I sensed that their development agenda--.  The list of things that they were working on or that they knew needed being done were similar to meetings that I had gone to that were primarily men, but when they started prioritizing the priorities were different.  I don&#8217;t know that I could tell you what they were, but I remember being impressed with that.  So anyway, I drove up there and I&#8217;m driving back and it must have been the springtime because after I got off the highway and I&#8217;m coming through the mountains from Kingsport to here I&#8217;m saying to myself, we have seven groups that are within reach and they don&#8217;t know each other.  So the first thing I did was get in touch with some of the leaders and I said, hey, this was such a wonderful thing; do you think we could get our groups together and just share some of this excitement with them?  So that&#8217;s what we did.  We had our first meeting down in Newcomb, which is on the other side of Jellico.
DC: When you say seven groups--?
MC: Seven nonprofit groups that were run by women in this immediate area, and I can tell you one was a childcare, one was a land trust, one was the Native American Association, three of them were friendship centers, which were basically used clothing and crafts kind of things.  I&#8217;ll never forget that first meeting because it was in one of the craft groups and they had a lovely meal, and when we met each other these women were so excited to meet other women that were doing things that you could hardly hear yourself talk, and these were people that if they came into a workshop like at a college they&#8217;d be, mmmm--. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: And one of the things that we realized was happening was that, like this group that was doing a clothing center or a craft group always wanted to have a childcare, so how do you do that, and how do you do this, so we were learning from each other.  So we ended up having meetings I think once every three months.  We started in the morning and went through the afternoon and we used the song, &#8220;Bread and Roses,&#8221; as our theme and we decided the morning was going to be the bread--we deal with the work--and then from lunch on would be the roses part.  After a couple of years we decided that the one thing we all wanted that we had tried and couldn&#8217;t do was a development education, so they decided they would form a nonprofit, and they called it Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, because we were learning through this exchange, and at that time they were set on getting a college degree.  So they learned from some man over in the next county how to go to different colleges and tell them what you wanted, and I remember him telling them, go to the one that you&#8217;re least interested in and practice on them.
DC: [Laughs]
MC: [Laughs] And then work your way up to--.  Well anyway, we ended up getting Carson Newman College--
DC: Okay, yeah.
MC: --to come, and I don&#8217;t know how many years, ten or fifteen years, that program kept going, and finally the original founders--.  Well I think the mistake was that the staff didn&#8217;t think they needed us, and at that point we didn&#8217;t pay much attention because they were running it, but then they really had to build a board and that board didn&#8217;t have the vision and they were doing all sorts of things in this building and they weren&#8217;t orienting the professors.  We used to orient the professors before we&#8217;d let them--. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: And so I think probably the excitement in all that long trip to get here, when it didn&#8217;t have that same dynamic I think the college finally gave up.  So anyway--.
DC: But they did it for some time.
MC: For a long time, yes, and it would be really fun to follow through on women--.  I remember one of the things we said was, and we want a degree not so we can move up and out but so we can do our job better.  I mean these were determined women.  It was so wonderful.
DC: So Carson Newman would come and teach courses, and did women get degrees from that?
MC: Yeah, I think some of them did, and I don&#8217;t know that anybody&#8217;s followed up on where any of them have gone. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] Right.
MC: Okay, so that was the first thing that happened through Rural American Women, that energized that, and then Rural American Women decided to form an organization and this Jane Threet, who started it, was the staff person.  She didn&#8217;t do so well in holding an organization together.  She had a wonderful press person who taught me a lot about how to deal with the press, and at one point--.  I was on the board, one of the founding twelve members, so that energized us for awhile, and we really wanted Rural American Women to hold together, and when it looked like Jane wasn&#8217;t going to be able to do it I offered to spend a year up there working with Jane, and my bishop--.  So I said to the bishop, would you let me do that and I&#8217;ll do half time there and half time here.  So I went up there and ended up spending more time there, but I didn&#8217;t know enough about Washington; Jane didn&#8217;t know enough how to work with me as a team and we could complement each other; so it was a little stressful.  So I went home and she kept on for awhile but it eventually folded.  It&#8217;s interesting; she ended up marrying a guy from TVA that I had introduced her to when we were organizing a hunger event down in this region, and then they moved back to North Carolina so they&#8217;re in Mars Hill.
DC: Okay.
MC: Then she started another group which she invited me on the board called In Our Own Way, so I worked with her for awhile on that and that wasn&#8217;t--.  It was taking too much energy.  But her husband, because he had been in program developments in TVA, between the two of them they did some really interesting stuff with local currency that I was very interested in, and I think now they&#8217;ve given up kind of both of those things.  I guess they&#8217;re old enough to be retired.  The last time I saw them they had a bed and breakfast place and they&#8217;ve given that up now too and I&#8217;ve kind of lost touch with them.
DC: Right.
MC: But at any rate, the year I was up there with Rural American Women, Jane Threet introduced me to a similar group who was working in urban areas, and it was called the National Congress of Neighborhood Women.  So this Jan Peterson said to me, well we always wanted to engage rural people but we couldn&#8217;t attract them, but now that Rural American Women and the National Congress, you know, how can we work together, because we were all empowering women who were working in their neighborhoods to improve their neighborhood.  So then when Rural America folded up three of us from the Rural went to the National Congress, and they were in Williamsburg, Kentucky, which was--I mean Brooklyn--because that wasn&#8217;t that far from where my parents lived, so when I could go up to visit my family, you know, and they began to be part of my family.  They were so thoughtful and good to me.  I remember when my dad died they just came to the funeral as if they had known me all their life, so they were very sensitive, good people.
But, the National Congress of Neigh--.  Now this gets into the heart of community development and what I&#8217;ve considered my ministry.  I think the people in New York who are doing wonders with neighborhood development and wonders as a National Congress of Neighborhood Women, they could not find the money to support their efforts, and in New York you need money. [Laughs] You can&#8217;t live off your vegetables.  But, being in New York they did get connected to the UN and through that they put us in wonderful connection with grassroots women from other countries.
DC: Okay, yeah.
MC: We had one--.  And talk to Carol Judy.  She&#8217;s been to Turkey.  She&#8217;s been to a half a dozen countries, and I&#8217;ve been to some too, and several of our other women have been like to Germany to the Mother Centers.  But what ended up happening was all the leadership of the National Congress then eventually got lured into taking jobs from the International and there was no leadership to support the National, so we&#8217;re hanging on like a thread and just fading into nothing and holding on because we own this building, which now is almost taken over by all these International [Laughs] people.  So the last move from the National Congress, the last strategy, was to identify three strong neighborhood groups, and one was in St. Louis, Missouri, which is a small city; one was this one, which is rural; and the other was Harlan County [Kentucky], which is a huge public housing group.  So we would be their three living/learning centers, and somehow from that things would happen, and I was supposed to be chair of that committee.  Well I am just ready now to write a letter resigning because the board people, who are also on this international thing, just cannot give the national thing time, and I can&#8217;t give it time.  There&#8217;s so much going on here and it&#8217;s a critical time in this area.  The woman in St. Louis, she&#8217;s not as old as I am but she&#8217;s sicker than I am.  She&#8217;s a black woman, wonderful, spirited, oh, such an amazing person, but she&#8217;s getting no income and she said, &#8220;I just can&#8217;t keep--.&#8221;  You know, we can&#8217;t hold onto our facilities.  And I guess the one in Harlan County, at the Weldon Johnson Public Housing, she&#8217;s got a lot of fight in her but it just takes so much every day.  She can&#8217;t give that kind of time to a national thing.  So I&#8217;m not sure that the national won&#8217;t fold and the building would be turned over either to some local organization or the international would keep control.  But now we can&#8217;t even attend these international things where women are doing such wonderful grassroots development.  It&#8217;s kind of from the ground up.  So that&#8217;s kind of sad, but if I can hold on to a little momentum with Appalachia I guess that&#8217;s kind of the most I can do right now. [Laughs]
DC: Is resources one of the major--?
MC: Oh, yeah.  I mean how can these younger people--?  They need something to live on.  Now you know I always had--.  I was pleased with what I had.  I started out in the &#8217;60s with a three thousand dollar stipend.  I also had the car though.  The diocese provided the car and they covered that insurance.  There was no health insurance in those days.  But I gradually got to a six thousand dollar salary and insurance and no car, and then when I got to a certain age when I could get this healthcare from the government, this Medicare, I said to the diocese, why don&#8217;t you contract or something with me, so that you don&#8217;t have to pay that medical, because four thousand dollars for a sick person that&#8217;s never been sick, and I have all these sick people [Laughs] in this community that can&#8217;t afford it and I can&#8217;t transfer that.  I said if I had this money maybe we could disperse it a little better.  So they did that for about--.  I guess I made like ten thousand dollars for the last three years, but I got to be a real problem as the church was growing because when I first went to--.  It was one diocese in Nashville for the whole state and I think that guy had some appreciation of rural life and he was willing to--.  He wanted to put me under the Catholic Charities department and I said, please, no.  I said when we were sisters and worked for Catholic Charities it didn&#8217;t work because the charity services are not the same services of development where you&#8217;re empowering the people to do, you know.
DC: For themselves, yeah.
MC: If you need a thrift shop we&#8217;ll show you how to start your own thrift shop. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] Right.
MC: But you don&#8217;t need Charities to come in and run a thrift shop for you.
DC: Right, hmm.
MC: So anyway, they allowed me to have my own board for awhile, and then another bishop came in and decided that he didn&#8217;t want that to go on, and by that time the board was a little tired of--.  They didn&#8217;t mind supporting me but they were tired of the church not being able to hear them [1:03:24] fighting for a position, and maybe I didn&#8217;t know enough about community development for the board to know enough, you know.  We might not have been ready.  But anyway, this other bishop says you need to work under Catholic Charities.  Well fortunately when I was in Nashville there was a sister running Catholic Charities who really believed in empowering the leadership of the Charities people, so I had the freedom to keep doing what I was doing.  Then when they formed a diocese in Knoxville they wanted Catholic Charities to be a strong organization, and these were new bishops coming into a new diocese and they didn&#8217;t want to fool with a new division.  They wanted to make sure that the traditional things were stable, so they wanted me to work with Catholic Charities.  The first Catholic Charities guy was a layman who was trying to please the bishop and he was determined that I had to work under him.  By this time I had formed an ecumenical advisory board and some of these other churches were really quite upset the way he was saying you have to be under them.  So we kind of gave up on that.  Then that bishop got changed and they had another--.  And he was a bishop who had run a Catholic Charities somewhere in Pennsylvania, so he wanted to really make Catholic Charities strong so he puts a wonderful priest in charge of Catholic Charities, and I think what happened was they probably started drawing in a lot of government monies to support some of these Catholic Charities things, and that probably had something to do with changing policies up there where church and government could do these things together.  Okay, but because they were getting so much of that money they had to have their own personal really high level accountant, and I always had some monies in my program, like I said if you give me three thousand there&#8217;s three thousand that I want to go to the community groups, and I might give them just five hundred and this one five hundred, but I could disperse it.  This guy was saying to me--after forty years they&#8217;re telling me I can&#8217;t do it that way.  Because we&#8217;re not a foundation we cannot give monies away. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: It was just so--.  So then when that bishop was getting ready to change, and I had gone to him several times and I&#8217;d said, look, I enjoy my work and I appreciate getting some support, but I said any time you feel like you don&#8217;t want me I won&#8217;t be hurt, [Laughs] you know.  So he called me in one day and he was getting ready to leave, and I guess he didn&#8217;t want to leave this little bugaboo [Laughs] with a problem for the next bishop, so he thought it was time and he said he would work out some kind of a pension for me and he&#8217;d stay in touch.  Well it was so funny because it ended up when I got the pension it was more than what my salary was,--
DC: [Laughs]
MC: --and I thought, I should have retired a long time ago. [Laughs] So now, you know, it&#8217;s all right with--.  I get a little bit of Social Security.  I never made much so I don&#8217;t get a lot in Social Security, but between the Social Security and the pension and the Medicare I really am living well enough and if I have any catastrophic health thing I&#8217;m just not even going to do it, you know. [Laughs] I&#8217;ve had a good enough life.  But it&#8217;s still strange now that even after having found a way to live and found even a more comfortable way to retire--I mean in terms of money I could, if I wanted to, live more comfortably--that there&#8217;s still people struggling to survive, so I still haven&#8217;t found out all the answers, but figure I&#8217;m not going to find them all out in my lifetime. [Laughs]
DC: Right.  And you currently reside on the land trust.
MC: I live--yes, and I really moved from my larger house.  Well when I bought the house we didn&#8217;t have a land trust but then the land that I lived on was connected to a piece they bought so I turned my land over to them and they gave me a lease and I own my house, and it was a small modest house, but then we didn&#8217;t have a meeting place and as the community was growing I added this piece on.  Then as I got older and we were trying to deal with this place and we didn't have a decent place to live and people were working over in my place and I couldn&#8217;t clean up that place and do this and keep my head together, so eventually I sold it.  If you sell your house on a land trust you have to give the land trust first option to buy it, so they bought it and I bought a smaller house, which ends up being nicer.  It&#8217;s a little further back in the woods but it&#8217;s up on the hill instead of down in the hollow and it&#8217;s got a lovely view.
DC: Is it a house that existed?
MC: Yes, it was one, and it&#8217;s interesting for several reasons.  One is that it was built as the last of seven houses that the land trust got monies for the Appalachian Regional Commission to buy the materials and monies from the Labor Department to train twenty Native Americans, so it was built by someone who had the heritage of--.  I mean you know they weren&#8217;t first generation but they had enough to qualify for getting help.  So there&#8217;s still something, when I look up on the ceiling they put all this stuff with these designs and it looks like it&#8217;s heavy and ready to fall on me.  I thought, oh, I wish I could fix that. [Laughs] And then the family that moved into it first ended up being the first family that gave birth to a child on the land trust, but then they didn&#8217;t do so well and they took off and went to upstate New York because they had a brother there and maybe they could make a better life, and they left without paying some of their rent.  So then they ended up coming back but they couldn&#8217;t get the house, and the house was empty for a few years and I asked for that one, so it took some remodeling because they had been kind of hard on it.
But I&#8217;m satisfied with everything--.  There&#8217;s one room that I want to turn into an office when I&#8217;m not here all the time, but now it&#8217;s just anything that needs to be filed or maybe I can write about, and little extra boxes or anything, pictures.  It&#8217;s kind of like--.  When I was a kid there was a comic radio show, &#8220;Fibber McGee and Molly.&#8221;  When you opened the door everything fell out.  Well that&#8217;s where--I&#8217;m just about there. [Laughs]
DC: That&#8217;s your room. [Laughs]
MC: So anyway.
DC: Another group I&#8217;m interested in that I&#8217;ve heard about is In Praise of Mountain Women.
MC: Oh, yeah!
DC: Can you tell me a little bit about that?
MC: Yes, indeed.  Carol can tell you about them too, because she&#8217;s been part of that, and I must let you have some time with her.  Well it starts with CORA, the Commission on Religion.  When they got started, when they decided to organize, part of it was that any denomination that was part of it had to have a committee in the region, so because I was Catholic the Catholics had to get busy and they founded this Catholic Committee of Appalachia.  So for awhile they took on the concerns of CORA and someone was elected to be on the CORA board, but after awhile what I found was that so many people had come into the region because of the &#8220;Bishops&#8217; Pastoral&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t know if you ever read the &#8220;Bishops&#8217; Pastoral&#8221;, This Land is Home to Me.  Well that brought a flood of people into the area, and the Catholic Committee of Appalachia for the most part got to be just a place to give each other support, and at that point in my life I didn&#8217;t need that.
But anyway, I was still hanging on at one point and by their tenth year because most of these people who came in were women they decided we should do something on the tenth year to honor women.  So I&#8217;m thinking to myself, rather than focusing on the wonderful women that we are--I didn&#8217;t say that out loud--I said, why don&#8217;t we think of some mountain women who have inspired us?  So they thought that was a wonderful idea and they got this little book together and they decided to name it In Praise of Mountain Women.  So then after the book circulated and a couple of years of nothing happening it was sort of like, why don&#8217;t we try to pull some women together?  So they got some grassroots women that had inspired them, and themselves, and they had a gathering of In Praise, and there was no big agenda, like what are you doing, or what are the issues, or stuff, but it was just honoring women and letting them be quiet and whatever, almost like a retreat, I guess.  Then I think they ended up deciding to try to--.  Well they had to raise money for that so that the women could come and wouldn&#8217;t have to pay, so these nuns, primarily, were running around getting monies from different churches, their own orders.  Then it got to be--.  They do this once every other year because it took that long to raise the money. [Laughs]
DC: Right. [Laughs]
MC: And then they began to shape like a board and a staff, both of which were free, but they don&#8217;t call it a board and a staff, and Carol will remember the names that they call them, the circle or--I don&#8217;t know.  They have some kind of name because they wanted to do everything their way and they weren&#8217;t going to fall into these [Laughs] conventional ways.  So they have this key group that meets every so often and then they bring in this other group once a year to sound it out.  Well, as it&#8217;s happening these wonderful women--like myself--are getting older, and Anne Leibig, who has really been--.  She calls herself the &#8220;psychic guarantee&#8221; for these women.  She just has to give up her position, and at one time--.
DC: Was she in FOCIS?
MC: Yeah, she is a FOCIS member, and she&#8217;s married to Dick Austin who went to Union.
DC: Okay.
MC: He&#8217;s one of the people--.  And they live in Dungannon now.
DC: Right, right.
MC: Yes, and you should meet him sometime.  In fact I have one of his books here that I can give you.
DC: What&#8217;s his name again?
MC: Dick Austin, and Anne Leibig.  So Anne is hosting the In Praise meeting the 12th and 13th of this month, I think, and they have gotten five hundred dollars to get this wonderful woman from Nashville to help them think through how they&#8217;re going to carry on without Anne.  So I called Anne not too long ago and said, oh, I&#8217;m so sorry but I&#8217;m probably not going to be able to get there because this is the same time when the Just Connections, which is this partnership between colleges [in the] community are having their board meeting here.  I think she was trying to say to me, well maybe it&#8217;s just as well because you don&#8217;t want them looking to you.  You&#8217;re already carrying enough. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
MC: And she says, I know how to loose myself and you&#8217;re still figuring that out.
DC: [Laughs]
MC: But I&#8217;m hoping Carol and Marian Collette can go to it because I think at some point--.  The last two meetings that In Praise has had they have gotten very much into--.  And this was one of my recommendations.  I said, Anne, you know you have this leadership support thing once every two years.  Why don&#8217;t we try to propagate this leadership support group for these women to have it in their communities where they live, find their friends and be a support to one another?  So she&#8217;s been trying to promote that.
DC: Right, yeah.
MC: And I think--.  I guess part of that resulted--yeah, this is it for sure.  One of the groups decided that the thing that held them together was having something to do and they decided to do a theater thing so they prepared this theater thing for the In Praise, and it was such a wonderful thing about nature and women&#8217;s--.  I think they identified it somehow to a butterfly in the cocoon and, I don&#8217;t know.  It was very nice.  So then they did the same thing this year and I think this year they moved into the theme of water, and I think when we started talking about, okay, what&#8217;s the water that&#8217;s closest to you other than the spigot, if you have a spigot?  And then we told our stories as we were in these circles and some people had a creek right in their backyard, some people had a well, somebody had a polluted stream, so we got to talking about this and the group was hoping that they could move into a sense of watersheds but several of us thought they&#8217;ll never get there because nobody&#8217;s ever heard of a watershed.  Well it was so interesting to see how quickly they got the connection, and when they have these In Praise, the last two times since I&#8217;ve been on the National Congress with these living/learning centers I&#8217;ve invited those two to come here for a meeting, but it would be at the same time as the Mountain Women so they could do the In Praise thing and see how women were organizing regionally.  Well, we all got so caught up on the water thing, and to hear this gal from Brooklyn saying, well, my water comes from the Adirondacks, which is part of the Appalachians, and I think it goes out into the Hudson River.  So then we kind of followed this water until all of us together realized that one way or another we got to the Atlantic Ocean.  And it was such a wonderful experience, but I think it put us in touch with the issues of water, because some of them had water and we got into serious issues.
So I think at some point if they can hold together and if we can hold together that someday this living/learning center, this community institute, will be a useful part to them, but that&#8217;s going to depend on people like Carol and Michelle and some of those younger people maybe going to that and just waiting until our time is right.
DC: Right, interesting.
MC: Yeah.  And I truly believe that Appalachia has something that our country needs, and if they can learn to hear the voice of indigenous people and how they&#8217;re rebuilding community.  One of the things that--and I guess it&#8217;s happened primarily through the National Congress of Neighborhood Women--we know that this incredible disconnect between rural and urban is absolutely disastrous if we keep going that direction.  That&#8217;s where I think we feel our mission when we bring college kids in here, and in a week they have a transforming experience. [Laughs] You should talk to these--.  Is it lunchtime?
DC: Yeah, it&#8217;s after noon.
MC: Okay.  Well I&#8217;ll see if they&#8217;ve got lunch ready.  It&#8217;s awfully quiet isn&#8217;t it, so maybe they do.  They probably would have fixed something for us.  But we have two filmmakers living with us who are from the Knoxville area.
DC: Oh, okay.
MC: It&#8217;s their first effort at filmmaking, and they wanted to be here for two months but they&#8217;ve been here for eight months and they&#8217;ve taken so much I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;ll ever get it edited, but in the process they began to feel some responsibility to participate in something.
DC: Sure.
MC: Just the other day this one, the more quiet one, he said, &#8220;This is the first day I have ever experienced having planted the greens and coming to the table and eating the greens.&#8221;  And now the two of them as their project are working on compost so that they&#8217;re building the soil.
