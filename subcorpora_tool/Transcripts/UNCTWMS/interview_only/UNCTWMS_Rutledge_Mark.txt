CM: This is Christina Mobley and I am interviewing Rev. Mark Rutledge. Hello, thank you for sitting down with me today.
MR: Glad to be here.
CM: Just to start off, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your childhood. Where were you born?
MR: A little farm town in Ohio called Kenton, not Canton but Kenton, the county seat of Hardin County, Ohio, in cornfields sixty miles north of Columbus. My father was a newspaper editor in that town and that&#8217;s the way I grew up, being part of that newspaper mentality.
CM: Were your parents religious?
MR: We all went to the First Christian Church, the Disciples of Christ Church, and my parents actually were best friends with the minister. He was pretty liberal for those days in the 50s. He was the best man at his wedding and when he got divorced and remarried was the pastor of our church. The previous pastor was very close. So I think the relationships there were what was important. My father played the organ at the church every once in awhile. I didn&#8217;t pay it that much attention. I mean, I was a kid and went to the high school. I was baptized and did the high school stuff, but I didn&#8217;t really think about it very much. It was just what you did. It was just part of the culture.
CM: Can you say a little bit about your education? Did you go straight into the ministry?
MR: Well, I went from there. I mean, I graduated from high school. I went to Oberlin College from high school. Kenton High School did not prepare me for the academics or anything else at Oberlin. I struggled to maintain a C average at Oberlin, but I learned a lot in spite of myself. I went there three years only. I graduated from UC-Berkeley after one year at Berkeley. My family went bankrupt and went to California and couldn&#8217;t afford to keep me at Oberlin. So I followed my family out, but those three years at Oberlin kind of opened up a lot of the world to me, even though I didn&#8217;t know what I was getting. I became an agnostic basically. I majored in political science and Russian history, and I carried Russian books home on Christmas vacation. Everybody thought I was a communist. I became an agnostic. So then I went to Berkeley.
CM: Did you go to Berkeley directly the next year after Oberlin?
MR: Right. I went three years at Oberlin and then I moved to Berkeley for my senior year.
CM: Do you remember what years those were?
MR: I graduated from Berkeley in &#8217;56. &#8217;52 to &#8217;55, I was at Oberlin.
CM: Okay, and then did Berkeley change your interests at all?
MR: Well, I had a good time as a senior at Berkeley and then I had to work. How can I put this? Well, when you graduate from college, you&#8217;re supposed to do something and like a lot of students that I&#8217;ve worked with over the years, I didn&#8217;t have a clue and I was interested in the God question somehow. I was curious about religion. I was outside, but I wondered if there was anything there and I thought, well, I&#8217;ll enroll in seminary. There was a seminary in Berkeley, the Pacific School of Religion, which was a liberal ecumenical seminary. And I thought, well, I don&#8217;t know what else I&#8217;ll do. I might as well go for a year and argue with the best theologians and best biblical scholars, and give it a year and then see because if I reject Christianity, I want to reject the best that&#8217;s out there. I don&#8217;t want to reject the street version of Christianity. So I figured I&#8217;ll give myself a year to argue with them and then I&#8217;ll decide what to do.   So I went to seminary and I actually loved it and I found out that you can be a critical thinker as well as a person of faith. This is what my teachers modeled, that like Baptism does not mean lobotomy. And so we had this critical thinking and reasoning engagement at the same time as faith, and I thought, well, if people like this can do that, I probably can too. So I stuck it out. I still didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. I just wanted the degree. I wanted to get the degree. It was a masters. I knew I would never take a church because I would last about two weeks if people knew what I really thought because I was still pretty liberal, but I at least knew that faith and reason didn&#8217;t have to be antagonistic. So that was when I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; And my last two years of seminary, I took four years, the last two I discovered this field called campus ministry, ministry in higher education, and they had teachers who taught this and they had courses in it. I took it and we met other campus ministers who talked about what they did and they came to class, and I said, &#8220;Well, I can probably do that. That sounds like fun.&#8221;   So I did an internship at Berkeley and then after I graduated, I went right to San Jose State University as an associate campus minister. Been doing it for forty years, forty years since.  CM: How did your parents feel about your decision to go to seminary?  MR: They just thought anything I wanted to do that would make me happy would be fine. I think they were surprised, they were surprised.  CM: And did you enjoy campus ministry?  MR: It&#8217;s been the best choice I ever could have made. It's just right for me in many ways, yeah.  CM: Did you get involved in activism at that time?  MR: Well, at San Jose State, I didn&#8217;t. I did kind of the traditional stuff the first five years. When I was there, we built a new campus ministry center and a chapel next to it. The last year I was there, the senior pastor who was conservative, who kind of put me under his thumb, went on sabbatical and a state commission told our board that I was to run the ministry, John was to get out of there, and this was the year of the coffee house ministry. We started a coffee house in the basement with the Lutherans and Episcopalians and our ministry, which was ecumenical, the Presbyterian Disciples UCC. That&#8217;s we&#8217;re talking mid-60s, &#8217;66, when in the Bay Area, the anti-Vietnam War stuff was going on. The pictures of me in those days and our students, everybody&#8217;s got a crew cut and they look like--.   But then things began to change within that one year. We started having rock bands in at our coffee house and open mike where people would read poetry and kind of got scruffy. The Hell&#8217;s Angels, one of those chapters, would come in and be our guardians. We got kind of scruffy and it freaked out my senior pastor, who was getting reports, and it freaked out the board. The whole deal was that I was to have it for a year and then I would go and he would come back because we were cutting staff.  So it was my year to do my thing and that&#8217;s what I did. A lot of that was the cultural change of what was going on in the Bay Area, in San Francisco and Berkeley. It was antiwar stuff and the poetry and the drugs were kind of coming in. So I was kind of part of that. The summer of love was the year after I left, I guess.   So I had to look for a job and I got a job at&#8212;you asked about activism. This is where our interview is going to come in. I circulated my dossier. I got asked for an interview at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. I thought, &#8220;Iowa? In the middle of the prairie? Here I&#8217;m at Berkeley and San Jose. And Iowa?&#8221; So I interviewed and it turned out that they had a multiple staff of four people and they wanted someone to work with the activist students. They had an intellectual that worked with the faculty and administration, who was the head of staff. They had a young hip conservative, I mean a young, hip guitar player who just graduated from Chicago to work with the students. And they had a conservative Baptist to work with the conservatives. And they would hire me to work with the antiwar activist radical students. They thought they would cover their bases, if you can imagine a campus ministry doing this. One of the people who interviewed me and had a vote was the student head of the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society].  CM: Wow.  MR: So they had a search committee and they interviewed me, and I met with the Christian normal students and I met with the activist students and they all said they wanted me to come. So we packed our bags and moved to Ames.  CM: Did you consider yourself an activist? How did you feel about the antiwar movement?  MR: Well, I was against the war because I got that in San Jose and I heard, I mean, Stanford, this is where a lot of the antiwar stuff started and in fact when I was at Berkeley before as an undergrad, I knew Quakers and I was associated with the Campus Y, which was where all the civil rights and civil liberties stuff came out of it, student civil liberties. One of the cofounders of SNCC was a student in a Y. So these were the people that I was associating with. So yeah, I was ready.  CM: What was his name?  MR: Michael Miller, a community organizer.  CM: That&#8217;s great.  MR: So all these--.  CM: Did you want to involve the ministry with the activism that was going on in the 60s?  MR: Oh, I thought that&#8217;s where the church ought to be, yeah. I mean, it was perfect. I mean, I was ready for that and the fact that they wanted to support this, I mean, I almost couldn&#8217;t believe it at the time. I don&#8217;t know too many ministries that did that. This could have been--. Like my campus ministry center, there were two centers, three actually, and mine was where the students would all meet before an action that was planned. We had residence there and so I knew what the students were planning and our head of staff, Paul Bodean, was in touch with the administration and faculty. So we coordinated. I had to be very careful not to violate confidences, but everybody knew what was happening so that when an action would happen or a demonstration, there was communication and the students knew this. Well, the administration credits the campus ministry, the way we operated, with preventing violence. There was no violence at Iowa State and they credit our ministry partly with that because we just kept the doors of communication open.  CM: So you were trying to facilitate the activism, would you say?  MR: Well, yeah, the first thing I did was go with a caravan of VW buses to DC in &#8217;67 for the first march on the Pentagon. I mean, I was right there. I accepted draft cards. Later, we came back for that and I guess the year after that, I worked with three students. We had a public ceremony where I accepted their draft cards, saying the church would stand with students who protest the war in this way. The church is an ally with the students because the church is antiwar. And then I mailed them to the federal marshals with a little letter and that&#8217;s when I got my FBI file. (laughs) Which I got later and saw that they were investigating me.  CM: Can you say a little bit about why you were opposed to the Vietnam War?  MR: Well, I guess two reasons. One was I just thought that the war itself was unjust. I mean, I never bought the case of why we should be there. I mean, I heard McNamara and even with Kennedy, I didn&#8217;t know; we didn&#8217;t quite know with Kennedy. But when Johnson came in and he started making the case, I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why we should be there.&#8221; The whole anticommunist thing, I didn&#8217;t buy it. So why? I mean, it&#8217;s their civil war, it&#8217;s their stuff. So I was opposed to the war, I guess you could say, on political grounds. But Jesus was a pacifist. The early church was pacifist, non-violent, and while I wasn&#8217;t a pacifist, I thought you had to make a pretty good case for a just war if you&#8217;re going to go war. The Christian Church has the tradition of a just war and they have four or five criteria, and I didn&#8217;t see where any of those were met in Vietnam. I mean, maybe World War II, you could make a case for just war theory. So I didn&#8217;t see any of that from the church&#8217;s perspective. So I said, &#8220;Well, anything we can do to end the war, we&#8217;ve got to be doing.&#8221;  CM: Had you been involved with civil rights at all earlier in the decade?  MR: I remember in San Jose marching with CORE when they were picketing the Bank of America. Yeah.  CM: And was the campus ministry in California and then in Iowa, were those integrated at all?  MR: Well, we had national organizations and national staff, but they&#8217;re really independent local chapters controlled by local boards. But there was communication and in some cases funding from the national staff. So there was a network of communication and support and understanding. There were a few things that were nationally, like they had national standards for evaluation of staff. So there were some resources from national and a lot of it was state by state. Northern California did its thing. Southern California, Iowa, did its thing pretty much.  CM: Were the ministries integrated racially?  MR: Of course, but in San Jose, there weren&#8217;t too many black students around to be connected with. In Iowa, well, one of the interesting things in Iowa was we had an extremely active black student population. They were activists and the leader of that, his name was Phil McGee and he was also gay. So he was organizing the black students to talk about black power and black student rights, and that wasn&#8217;t my primary mission from the campus ministry, but I was an ally to that. I wasn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t say, a major factor at all then, but I was an ally and I went to some of their actions just as a participant. They were at our house sometimes. It was, I would say, minor support and moral support and friendship with Phil and some of the other black students. Yeah.   One of the actions they did was they put white crosses on the lawn in front of the administration building based on the number of black students that were at Iowa State, saying &#8220;we need, black students need more services from the university and because the university is ignoring a lot of our presence and needs, these black crosses represent the students asking for action from the university.&#8221;   CM: And what was the response of the university?  MR: Well, they formed a committee. (laughs) Discussed it, made a few changes.  CM: How did you become involved with the abortion issue?  MR: Well, I&#8217;m trying to think if I had any prior reason for that. I&#8217;d have to think about that for a minute. Before that, that was not on my radar screen so much, before I went to Iowa, as a movement or a social need, I don&#8217;t think.  CM: Did you have a personal experience with abortion in Iowa that made you involved?  MR: Well, I remember my wife and I in San Jose used to talk about neither of us wanted children and we just had this tacit, we just said, &#8220;Well, if we ever got pregnant, we&#8217;d get an abortion.&#8221; I mean, but she never got pregnant so we never had to deal with it. I mean, we just said, it was kind of hypothetical, &#8220;If you ever got pregnant, well, we&#8217;d just of course get an abortion, we&#8217;d find a way to get an abortion.&#8221; But that was all we ever talked about. To that extent, it was personal. And the question did I have a personal, no, no.  CM: How did you become involved with abortion and abortion counseling in Iowa?  MR: Well, because I was interested in social justice, it became a social justice issue for me, but it wasn&#8217;t immediately that. I think the way it happened was I guess one of the other ministers, probably Paul on our staff, I think he got a call or a letter from somebody who was working with Spencer Parsons (18:04), one of the other local pastors in town, and they were talking about organizing in Ames a chapter of the Clergy Consultation Service. I said, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Come to the meeting and find out.&#8221; So I went to the meeting and they described how they operated. Spencer Parsons himself was not at that meeting, but I think one of the local pastors&#8212;I&#8217;m very vague about this&#8212;one of the pastors in town that he worked with came and talked about the procedures that Clergy Consultation, the methods and the procedures and the rationale for the service. I just went and learned about it. And Paul said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, I will too.&#8221;   CM: Had you had any experience with female students coming to you with this problem before that point?  MR: No.  CM: No.  MR: I&#8217;d have to think about that for a minute.  CM: What was your experience once you decided to join the Clergy Consultation in Ames?  MR: Well, we had some training. We had a couple of training meetings.  CM: Were those locally organized?  MR: Yeah, in Ames, mostly using the mimeograph, believe it or not, paperwork that came out of Spencer Parsons&#8217;s office, I guess. I mean, there was all this paper we got of procedures, clinics: &#8220;Here&#8217;s how we work with the clinics and here&#8217;s what the clinics do and here&#8217;s how to make a referral. Here&#8217;s our purpose as a service.&#8221; Which you&#8217;ve probably seen all that stuff.  CM: No, I haven&#8217;t actually. It&#8217;s very interesting.  MR: Well, I don&#8217;t remember it, but I remember our ground rules were it was called Clergy Consultation Service on Problem Pregnancies, Adoptions, and Abortions. So we, &#8220;we&#8221; the counselors, were to help women think through the choices, options and choices, non-judgmentally. We weren&#8217;t supposed to have a position, which I didn&#8217;t anyway. My only position was women should be free to choice what they want to do and that was why I did it. It was &#8217;68, just before the women&#8217;s rights thing became big. I think The Feminine Mystique was written in &#8217;67, and I remember getting a copy of that in &#8217;69. So I was kind of beginning to think, &#8220;Oh, women&#8217;s rights.&#8221; I was beginning to think about that. I thought, &#8220;Well, this is part of that movement.&#8221; It&#8217;s a justice issue for women. Women should choose. The government shouldn&#8217;t tell them not to choose, that they can&#8217;t choose. Abortion should not be illegal. And as I began to hear these horror stories about because abortion was not legal and the horrible experiences women were having to go through, I just said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not right.&#8221; I think men generally get into some of this stuff because of justice. I think women maybe have somewhat different motivations.  CM: Did you consider yourself a feminist?  MR: I didn&#8217;t know what that word meant in &#8217;67, in &#8217;68. I think the first time I heard&#8212;well, the director of the YWCA was a flaming radical and she was part of our campus ministry staff, and I think she was the first person that ever used the F-word in one of our meetings. So I made that connection. She really was the one that helped me get it and so I got it in &#8217;68 probably. &#8217;67 was the antiwar. &#8217;68 I began to do other things like that.  CM: Was she involved with Clergy Consultation or with abortion rights?  MR: I don&#8217;t know. I would assume yes. Was she part of our--? I don&#8217;t know.  CM: How did the referral system work?  MR: Well, we would&#8212;  CM: You were given a list of clinics?  MR: Well, that&#8217;s the second thing. One is how we got clients, how did women reach us, and second, how did we refer. So we advertised. We had a telephone system. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re heard this, haven&#8217;t you? Where we would have a message and we&#8217;d change the numbers and we would put ads in the paper and we would say, I forget the wording of the ads, but the idea was if you have a problem pregnancy and want to talk to somebody, I think it was &#8220;clergy are available.&#8221; It was like we were respectable and I think a lot of women were saying is this&#8212;  the reason that we did it was because trying to go to some kind of back alley referral service, I mean, a lot of women wouldn&#8217;t want to do that. It wasn&#8217;t as easy for women to do that. Well, if they knew that there were clergy who were out and doing it, that they would feel safer and feel welcome and maybe this was more legitimate.   So this phone answering service, women would see the ad, either know somebody or themselves, and say, &#8220;Oh, I want to talk. I definitely want to explore this.&#8221; They would call a number that was in the ad, which changed because, I don&#8217;t know, we just wanted to have some precautions. And somebody would record a message: &#8220;If you want to talk to one of our counselors,&#8221; I think it said, &#8220;Leave your name and number and we&#8217;ll call you back,&#8221; or somebody like that, some way to make a connection so we&#8217;d call them back. Maybe we had one clergy that rotated once a month who&#8217;d receive these calls and then they would call me and say, &#8220;Mark, we have somebody who would like to be counseled.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think women would call me directly, but I would call them or they would call me. See how vague I am. But there was a connection made and then we made an appointment and they would come in.  CM: Was it made clear in the ads that one could get an abortion referral from the service?  MR:  Well, that was the name of the service. I think so, I think so. Yeah, we wanted to be out and we were taking a chance that the prosecutors weren&#8217;t going to come after a bunch of respectable clergy.  CM: Were you worried about that?  MR: A little bit, not very much. I&#8217;d already made my risks with the antiwar thing, with the FBI thing. What did I have to lose? That was just the way I looked at it. We knew there was some chance. We were told it was unlikely, but I don&#8217;t think mostly they did go after very many of us, maybe a few. I think there were very, very few that they did, not very many. So we generally felt protected because our, quote, role in the community. Are they going to go after the pastor of First Presbyterian Church? I don&#8217;t think so. But they could have and we knew it and I was &#8220;bring it on&#8221; kind of thing. I was more interested in doing the work that I was worrying about that. It was always kind of in the background. I mean, when you do draft cards and do that kind of stuff, you&#8217;re out there too, which is part of the general 60s, late 60s scene.   So women would come in and I guess somehow they got my number too sometimes. Sometimes they had my number. It was kind of vague how--. Maybe the contact person said &#8220;call Mark. There were layers of contacts. You can tell me after the interview here if you know more how that worked because I&#8217;m so vague. It was a long time ago. So I would sometimes get these calls at three in the morning from these Iowa housewives who say, &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant and no way I&#8217;m going to have this baby. If you can&#8217;t help me, somebody&#8217;s going to die or something bad is going to happen.&#8221; So I&#8217;d make an appointment for the next day and people came in.   CM: What would happen once the women came in? What was the counseling experience like?  MR: Okay, yeah. Well, I would explain my role, that we&#8217;re here to help you implement whatever decision you make and my concern is to help you make the best decision for you that you can make, whether it&#8217;s to have an adoption, whether it&#8217;s to keep the baby, or whether it&#8217;s to have an abortion. Those are the basic three options. And it&#8217;s to help you explore these options by yourself and kind of help you think through them so that when you do make a decision, you&#8217;ll be comfortable with it. So that was our ground rule, to help them think through the options and make a good decision so they didn&#8217;t have to feel bad about the decision that they were making. I think in all the&#8212;I can&#8217;t even tell you how many women I counseled. I&#8217;m going to guess twenty, fifty, twenty over the course of the last two years that I was there. I left in &#8217;71. I think I only referred one for adoption and very few kept the baby and the majority wanted an abortion.   So once they came to that conclusion on their own, all I did was ask questions and explore and listen. But once one of the women said, &#8220;I want an abortion,&#8221; or something like that, then we got these updates on clinics and procedures for making a referral. For the most part, especially in the early, the first year, year and a half, all of our, most of our referrals went to a clinic in Kansas City. And it said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the clinic. Here&#8217;s the phone number. Here&#8217;s what you do.&#8221; The women were to call the clinic, make an appointment. From Ames, they drove or took a bus and they would be met or I think the Kansas City people had a place for them to stay, maybe in private homes or maybe some of them went to motels. They saw the doctor, had an abortion, came back, came home. It sounds fairly straightforward to say it today that way. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t so easy for them in those days since it was illegal.   CM: Did most of the women that you saw have the means to get to Kansas City and to pay for the abortion?  MR: Well, we worked to keep the price down. I mean, we negotiated. Because our network, we were a major source of referral, we had some power in helping them set fees.  CM: Oh, that&#8217;s interesting.  MR: I mean, we negotiated these things with the clinics. We wanted the fees kept reasonable. I think it was between two fifty and three fifty (hundred dollars). That&#8217;s my memory, somewhere, two hundred, three hundred. We wanted to make sure that when they got to the clinic, they were made to feel safe and taken care of. So we negotiated some of the terms of service as well and then we would ask the women when they came back, sometimes, often how was your experience, so we&#8217;d get an evaluation of the clinic. And I remember, a couple of times the evaluations came back badly. So we&#8217;d have to get in touch with the clinic and say, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got some reports. What are you going to do about this?&#8221;   CM: Was it ever the case that an individual was not able to pay for it? And in that case, would you have helped them or negotiated with the clinic perhaps to try to--?  MR: That wasn&#8217;t anything that I personally got involved with. I cannot answer that question. I have a vague memory that in a few cases, we, the clergy, helped some of the women financially, but none of the women that I counseled that was the case. They pretty much could do it, handle the fees themselves. But there was some discussion of that and I think in a few cases, yes, not mostly.   CM: Do you remember if most of the women you counseled were, say, students or married or single, sort of age group?  MR: We didn&#8217;t too many students.  CM: No?  MR: I don&#8217;t know why, maybe one of two students. They were mostly housewives and they were mostly women who, I would say at least half or more were women who were married and already had families, or they were single women trying to start lives. They were older than students. They were over twenty-two, most of them.  CM: Were the husbands in these cases generally aware?  MR: I can&#8217;t separate out how I discussed that with the women that saw me at Ames and how I did it at Illinois later where that was one of my standard questions.   CM: So in 1971, you moved to Illinois?  MR: No, I went to Monterey, California, and then in &#8217;73, I went to Illinois. And then I did my dissertation there in the mid-70s and I had structured&#8212;well, you saw the questionnaires. So I explored that in Illinois, but I don&#8217;t think I made such an emphasis on that in Ames. I don&#8217;t think it was one of my--. I was there to help the woman.   CM: When you left Iowa, was that the end of your involvement with Clergy Consultation?  MR. Yeah. In California, I was doing something else. I was working in a drug abuse program in a community college. It wasn&#8217;t relevant. And then in Illinois, I wasn&#8217;t really involved with the consultation service. Well, things became legal then. So I figured, well, that takes care of that.  CM: Did you have women that returned for counseling after they received their abortion?  MR: In Ames?  CM: Mmm hmm.  MR: I&#8217;d have to really think about that for a minute. I think I said, &#8220;If you want to see me when you come back, call me.&#8221; Most did not call. I think I had a couple of phone calls. I think I had a couple of people who wanted to come back and talk about--. Sometimes I&#8217;d say, &#8220;We&#8217;d like to find out from you what your experience was also.&#8221; So we had a couple of women come back and say, &#8220;Well, here is my experience.&#8221; And a couple of times, women would call and they just wanted to talk about it and let me know how they were doing. I think in two or three cases, people had some residual feelings about it they wanted to talk about. They&#8217;d been raised Catholic and they wanted to talk about the religious part of it. I think being clergy, I think the people would have that perception that we could talk to them about their religious issues, not very often.   CM: Did you have allies or perhaps even enemies in the community?  MR: Well, the other clergy were our allies. If we had any opposition, I&#8217;m not aware of it. We were out there and doing our thing, and I didn&#8217;t pay any attention to what anybody else thought. If we had any criticism from the community or the church, I&#8217;m not aware of it. I did not personally get any flak for this.  CM: And did you see the abortion rights movement as part of either the women&#8217;s movement or the civil rights movement? I know we touched on that a little bit.  MR: Well, because I saw it as a justice issue, I mean, the way I think about it is you go from individual counseling to social change. I mean, what we were doing was putting Band-Aids on a social problem in a way. We were counseling individuals. Well, that&#8217;s fine and it&#8217;s needed and we need to do it, but if we&#8217;re going to get anywhere, the whole thing has to change. So there was an obvious connection to me. I&#8217;m trying to think if I was involved in the political arm of it at that time before Roe v. Wade. I don&#8217;t think I was involved in direct--. I might have written, no, I can&#8217;t say that I was involved in direct political action around the abortion issue when I was in Ames. I don&#8217;t know when the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights was formed. I can&#8217;t even tell you when that was formed. I mean, I was involved in that later. We assembled church statements saying that it&#8217;s okay, that the church supports the rights of women. So it was a  religious liberty issue for me.   CM: How did you feel about the Roe decision? Do you remember when Roe was passed?  MR: Well, was it &#8217;73? In &#8217;73, I was&#8212;  CM: Were you in California or were you in Illinois?  MR: I went directly from Ames to Monterrey Peninsula College, California, and I worked in drug abuse programs. I left the church for those two years. So I&#8217;d switched, I had a different life, and I was working with Vietnam vets who were coming back from Vietnam. I just did counseling and helped get them into college. And I was helping students who were involved in drugs. The college had a program and I was involved in that. I was hired to be the one of the drug abuse education counselor-type people. That&#8217;s what I was doing in Monterey and then I left Monterey in &#8217;73 and went to Illinois in the fall of &#8217;73. I mean, that&#8217;s the way the trajectory went.  In Illinois, I was doing different stuff.   Oh, and your question about Roe v. Wade. Oh yeah, when Roe v. Wade came in, see, in &#8217;70 and &#8217;71 and &#8217;2, there were states, New York, Colorado, California, that had more open laws and I kind of saw that maybe as preparing the way for legal change. I guess we kind of saw it had to happen through the courts, though as states did this, I thought, well, this is a model for what we want to work for. We didn&#8217;t always have to use Kansas City. We could refer people to California and New York if they had the money to get there. We had options. Once New York and Colorado and California became legal, we had some legal options and that slowly emerged. So when Roe v. Wade came along and I knew about the clinic we had in New York, which after Roe v. Wade became one of the first to accept women, well, that was one of, quote, our clinics, our clinics. When Roe v. Wade was passed, I thought, well, it&#8217;s about time and we can move on now. Let&#8217;s get on with it, was my reaction. Hooray for the court. We won. We don&#8217;t have to do this anymore.   CM: So I know that you came back to abortion counseling in your PhD research. Can you say a little bit about why you came back to abortion counseling and a little bit about your research?
MR: Well, there were two reasons. One, I was in a doctoral program in counseling and one of the things you do in counseling, quote, research is to say, &#8220;Does counseling make a difference?&#8221; And we learned these statistical methods, pre-/post-counseling intervention, and I was interested in designing a dissertation proposal that would be clean, simple, and easy to do so I could get out of there in a year or two. And I thought, well, so what kind of counseling can I do that would demonstrate a counseling intervention in a defined population, in a defined way, and still be related to my interest in social justice? And I thought, well, of course. This was in &#8217;75. I thought, well, of course, abortion counseling. Does counseling make a difference for women who choose abortion? I mean, it just clicked. All the interest came together. I could design it as a clean dissertation. I didn&#8217;t have to mess around with open-ended questions and that kind of stuff, and I&#8217;d do a nice statistical analysis and be out of there.   And by focusing on abortion counseling, I guess one of the things I was interested in is all the opponents of abortion talk about the horrible things that happen to women after they get abortions. They&#8217;re going to be guilty, the negative sequel. I mean, the literature was full of, quote, negative sequel, that women have abortions and then they have negative reactions. And I thought that&#8217;s baloney in my experience. It happened in a few, in some cases, but in general, it does not. So I thought, well, if I can refute that argument coming from the pro-life people with some hard data, then I could still somehow do a dissertation and I could then say, &#8220;Look, what you&#8217;re saying is not&#8212;the data refutes what you&#8217;re saying about women having negative reactions.&#8221; So I thought this would be a perfect coalescence of a neat design, counseling that I could do that was meaningful, and contribute to the social justice cause. So I think that&#8217;s why I did it.  CM: What did you find in your PhD research?  MR: Well, I had three measures. Well, it was a nice clean pre-/post-test design study. Because I knew the director of the student health service, so I proposed to her that I be the counselor. And they were getting students coming in a lot who were pregnant.  CM: Did they have a counseling structure post-Roe v. Wade for abortion counseling?  MR: At the student health service?  CM: Or did you create that post?  MR: Well, it was a very enlightened student health service and I think when women came in who were pregnant, they said, &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re pregnant,&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think they had any structured way. I don&#8217;t know if they referred students for abortion or not. Your role was just to say, &#8220;Your pregnant. Your test came back positive.&#8221; Did they refer? I do not know. I know that when I went to the head of the student health service, I made a little proposal and said, &#8220;I will come in here and be your counselor for the women that have positive pregnancy tests.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I need it for my dissertation.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It would do me good. It will do you good because it will free up your other counselors. They won&#8217;t have to do that. You won&#8217;t have to do it. If there&#8217;s any heat, I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221; It was kind of a proposal and it was a very enlightened student health service director, and she said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; So they gave me a little cubby hole in the student health service and I&#8217;d go in periodic, I mean, whenever there were--. I was the one who actually presented the results. The women came to find the results of their pregnancy tests and I was the one to present the positive results. I mean, that was kind of unusual that they would allow an outsider to do that, and I thought, &#8220;Oh, boy.&#8221; This was from the start.  CM: So you really were counseling from the--?  MR: From the very beginning. And I think the way it was set up was while they were&#8212;oh, God, this is terrible. While they were waiting, I had three pre-tests: how much anxiety, self-concept, and your locus of control. Do you have an internal sense that you can make decisions for yourself? And they were standardized tests and they sat in the waiting room and they took these tests while they were waiting to get their pregnancy test results. I think that&#8217;s the way it worked because I had to have a pre-test. Isn&#8217;t that weird? I can&#8217;t remember. I either did it that way or&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t do that, no. Here&#8217;s the way it worked. I gave them the results of their test and I told them what I was doing and that I needed students for my project. And I said, &#8220;I will counsel you and refer you to whatever you want if you will volunteer to be in the study.&#8221; I had a sheet that they signed. And then I said, &#8220;The first part of this is to take these three tests and if you agree to do this, then&#8212;  CM: Did a lot of the women agree?  MR: Almost everybody.  CM: Really?  MR: Yeah. I had very few refusals. I mean, they were happy to do it. Yeah, they did.   CM: And what was the outcome of the study?  MR: Well, they filled out these tests and almost all of them, well, I only took them in the study if they wanted an abortion. We had a clinic at Rockford. It was a very good clinic and I&#8217;d give them all the information about the Rockford clinic and they&#8217;d go up to Rockford and get their abortions. And then four to six weeks after the abortion, they&#8217;d come back for a second counseling session. It was all set up.   Once they agreed to be in the study, I had a brief counseling&#8212;you know all this from reading it&#8212;but I had a brief counseling group that I designed these questionnaires called the minimum kind of decision-making counseling. It&#8217;s what you need least. Then I had a much longer exploratory process to really get further into how the women were feeling about what they were doing, their thoughts, their ideas, all the stuff that their partners, all the stuff related to the issue that wasn&#8217;t in the first questionnaire. What I did was flip a coin, random assignment. I also had a female co-counselor. We did the same thing because I wanted to look at is there a difference between a man doing this counseling and a woman doing this counseling. And she was there with me and half would go to her, and half would go to me. It was all very elaborate. I don&#8217;t think the students knew this, but we told them what we were doing. We were very above board. So they were assigned to her or me, the short brief counseling or the extended counseling, and we did that process. They had their abortions. They came back.   What I found out was, of course, their anxiety decreased; that was obvious. The question was how are they going to feel? Is their whole self-concept about how they feel about themselves going to be better? And that was tricky because you&#8217;d assume that there would be some better just because they&#8217;d gone through this process. How about internal locus of control? Do you feel you control your life better as a result of this? And again, you&#8217;d expect some improvement. Well, I was blown away when I got statistical improvement from counseling. I didn&#8217;t really expect that. I hypothesized it. But I was amazed when it came out that the brief counseling group improved a little bit, but the extended counseling group statistically improved. Now that was significant for me. So I say, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;ve got data that shows that women, whether they&#8217;re counseled or not, improve in these two major variables.&#8221; Well, this is pretty significant stuff and the anecdotal data coming back was I think one of the questions was, &#8220;Did you make the right decision for yourself or do you feel bad about yourself?&#8221; The vast majority said, &#8220;I made the best decision I could.&#8221; Not much in the way of regrets.   So I had data and hard stuff to rebut the kind of popular wisdom that women feel bad about themselves after an abortion. I said, &#8220;No, they don&#8217;t. They feel better.&#8221;  CM: What did you then do with the findings of your study? Did you in any way advocate for abortion counseling or try and take on what you call the &#8220;popular conceptions&#8221; about abortion?  MR: I was more active in New Mexico, where I went from DeKalb. I was a member of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights that was an action group, and I wasn&#8217;t that active, I guess I was only minimally active in Illinois. I was so much involved in doing my dissertation and getting the work, but after I went to New Mexico, I thought, &#8220;My God, I&#8217;ve got all this data.&#8221; And New Mexico had a very active network of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights. We changed our name to something else pro-choice, Clergy for Choice, something like that. I started writing letters. Every time I&#8217;d see a letter to the editor in the newspaper or I&#8217;d see something, I&#8217;d write a letter back and say, &#8220;No.&#8221; I started just writing letters to the editors and getting my stuff out there. Then also how did I get on--? I wrote an article for a book about it. I made this point pretty strongly and I can&#8217;t remember how that connection came about. I think the author, who was writing a book about abortion, saw my dissertation and asked me if I&#8217;d like to write a chapter and I said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; So I put it into a capsule form and summarized my service and sent it to him.  CM: Was it in &#8217;77 that you finished your dissertation?   MR: &#8217;78-79, &#8217;77-78.   CM: And then you went directly to New Mexico?  MR: In 1980, I went to New Mexico, so it was &#8217;78-79 was the wrapping up the dissertation stuff, and I didn&#8217;t write my chapter until I went to New Mexico. He looked, he tracked me down in New Mexico after I&#8217;d moved, the author of this book.  CM: What were you doing in New Mexico?  MR: I was doing campus ministry.  CM: Again?  MR: The only two years I was not doing campus ministry was in Monterey, California, when I was doing counseling.   CM: Did you continue to be involved in the issue throughout the 80s and 90s?  MR: Well, in New Mexico, I was very much involved in the activist, I think it was called&#8212;I forget the title. See what happens. I told you memory was unreliable. &#8220;Religious Freedom&#8221; was in the title. The issue, the political issue was people were saying abortion is murder. The whole pro-choice/pro-life thing was heating up. The issue was they were saying, &#8220;Abortion is murder because you&#8217;re murdering a human baby and therefore there should be an anti-abortion amendment. It should be illegal.&#8221;   The counterargument from the religious community that we were making was one, because most of the mainline religious churches support pro-choice, the freedom of women to choose, you shouldn&#8217;t do this. It&#8217;s a matter of religious freedom because when does the, quote, fetus become a human being? They were saying it&#8217;s at conception and what we were saying is no. For example, if you&#8217;re Jewish, conception does not happen until the crown of the head breaks the birth canal. So here&#8217;s a whole religion for the most part saying no, and there were other religious groups who were taking different positions. So my argument was it&#8217;s a matter of religious freedom. There should not be a national--. You&#8217;re violating my religious conscience if you make abortion illegal for everyone because my church and not only mine, but the Jewish religion and others, say that it&#8217;s not murder and for you to enact a law saying it is, is a violation of religious conscience. That&#8217;s the argument.  CM: You see that a theological issue&#8212;  MR:  Yeah.  CM: Versus a scientific issue?  MR: Well, it&#8217;s a theological one, which leads to a political one, yeah.  CM: Where did you go from New Mexico? How long were you there?  MR: I was in New Mexico from 1973 to 1980.   CM: In New Mexico?  MR: Yeah, I went right from California. I went right from California in &#8217;73 to New Mexico. I might have said something different earlier. Illinois: &#8217;67 to &#8217;71. California: &#8217;71 to &#8217;73.   CM: And when were you in Ames doing counseling?  MR: &#8217;67 to &#8217;71. I&#8217;m sorry, maybe I didn&#8217;t--.  CM: &#8217;67 to &#8217;71.  MR: I was in Ames.  CM: Was in Ames. And then &#8217;71&#8212;  MR: To &#8217;73 was in California.  CM: Was in California. And then from California you went to do your&#8212;  MR: New Mexico.  CM: Okay.  MR: &#8217;73 to &#8217;80. No, I was in New Mexico seventeen years. You know, I really screwed this up. I&#8217;m going to start again, I&#8217;m sorry.   CM: Because you did your PhD in&#8212;  MR: I&#8217;m going to start again, I&#8217;m sorry.  CM: Okay.  MR: I was in Ames from &#8217;67 to &#8217;71. I was in Monterey from &#8217;71 to &#8217;73. From &#8217;73 to &#8217;80, I was in Illinois. I&#8217;m sorry.   CM: And then in 1980 you went to New Mexico?  MR: 1980 I went to New Mexico. I was there for seventeen years, sixteen, seventeen years.  CM: Did you retire after New Mexico?  MR: Partly. When I was in New Mexico, we moved there in 1980 and I&#8217;d just had a baby with my second wife. So Alison and I moved there in &#8217;80 with our brand new baby. Alison and I were divorced in 1985, &#8217;86.   CM: And so you continued as campus minister until 1987 in New Mexico?  MR: 1997.  CM: 1997, I&#8217;m sorry, and where did you go from there?  MR: Here.  CM: You came to North Carolina. What brought you to North Carolina?  MR: I followed my wife. I married Betsy, my current and third wife, living happily after, I should say that, in &#8217;87, and we lived in New Mexico, together in New Mexico for ten years, nine years. We came here in &#8217;96 for an exchange together, my wife and I. We traded campus ministry jobs with the Duke campus minister. He took my job in New Mexico. We shared his job at Duke and then at the end of that year, Betsy said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going back to New Mexico,&#8221; and she got a great job here at Duke with the Kenan Institute for Ethics directing, starting, and founding their service learning program. And so she took that job and I was ready to retire in &#8217;97. So I retired from New Mexico, followed her to Duke, created a part-time job at Duke Chapel for myself about quarter time doing pretty much what I wanted to do in retirement. I&#8217;ve done a lot of interesting things, different things there in my campus ministry job at Duke. And she retired two years ago from Duke, from the Kenan Institute for Ethics.  CM: Have you remained involved with the abortion issue? Would you say you&#8217;re still involved now?  MR: Well, only in the sense of things like this and I was on a panel that Laura Micham, head of the library, did several years ago.  CM: At Duke?  MR: At Duke. I served on a panel talking about this kind of stuff with one of the doctors from UNC who had been one of the doctors who&#8212;  CM: Was that Takey Crist or--?  MR: The other one.  CM: Jerry Hulka?  MR: Yes. He and I were on a panel together at one of Laura&#8217;s programs. So I&#8217;ve spoken about it, talked about it. I&#8217;ve written some letters. I wrote some letters to the editor at The Chronicle and one to the N&amp;O when these things come up saying, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221; So I&#8217;ve stayed active, but politically not so much here, just in those ways.
CM: How do you feel about where the abortion rights issue is now? The abstinence only education in North Carolina or the pro-life movement fighting against&#8212;
MR: Well, I think this health care stuff, and I want to throw a brick through the TV the way they&#8217;re using that issue as a wedge into the health care reform issue, it drives me nuts.
CM: For example&#8212;
MR: I&#8217;m very naive. I think, okay, we had Roe v. Wade, we&#8217;ve had all these years of experience, and yet it&#8217;s still a hot button issue. It&#8217;s a hot button cultural issue. Why? I&#8217;m so naive. I don&#8217;t understand it. In my gut level reaction, I think why are these pro-life people so crazy about this issue? I mean, that&#8217;s my gut reaction. They&#8217;re nuts. They&#8217;re crazy. The Catholic Church, the fundamentalists, the evangelicals, they&#8217;re nuts. And then I realize, well, they have their integrity too. They have their religious reasons, which I think are completely false, that drives them into this arena and so it becomes politicized, and it shouldn&#8217;t be politicized. And this whole push to get an anti-abortion amendment. I give money to NARAL, Women&#8217;s Rights League, and I&#8217;ll make a donation and I&#8217;m willing to speak about it anywhere just in terms of my experience and what I think as a clergy. I&#8217;m willing to do that. Nobody has asked me very much. I&#8217;ve an email list-serve of about seventy-five people, some of whom are Republicans and I send them stuff saying, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to think about this.&#8221; I mean, I argue with people all the time about this. I mean, I don&#8217;t have that much political clout. So what can I do? I just do the few things that I can in my little circle of friends, and give money here and there, and speak and write a little bit. That&#8217;s about all I can do.   CM: If I could ask a question going back a little bit, I&#8217;m curious as to what you found about female versus male abortion counselors.  MR: No difference.  CM: No difference. And do you think that abortion&#8212;  MR: I was surprised by that too, by the way, anyway.  CM: Do you feel that abortion counseling should still be offered as part of a medical or counseling service?  MR: It should part of the medical establishment. It should just be part of the normal, cultural, social, medical complex. It should be a non-issue as far as I&#8217;m concerned. It should just be standard medical practice. For those women for whom it is a, quote, religious issue, there should be people like me around to talk about it with, explore it with. So I guess women go to their ministers and clergy and priests and talk about it if they have religious concerns. Is it a medical concern, a religious concern, both? For some women, it&#8217;s both. I just hope they can find a good minister or priest when they go to them.   CM: Do you have feelings about sexual education? Of course, being in North Carolina, they just re-passed funding for abstinence-only education, which has existed in the state for quite a while. Do you see that sex education is related?
MR: Oh sure because it&#8217;s a complete contradiction to say, well, you can&#8217;t have good sex education that includes contraceptive information on the one hand, and then be opposed to abortion on the other. It&#8217;s a contradiction in terms. Yeah. I give money to SIECUS. There&#8217;s a group called SIECUS that is an advocate. Elise Neil was in town recently and we talked. It&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s a huge issue today politically and it drives me crazy. I don&#8217;t know what else I can say about it. I talked to David Price the other day. He was at Duke reunions, Duke Founders Day, and I saw him and told him how much I appreciated his support in this area: &#8220;You need to know your voters out here support what you&#8217;re doing to keep the abortion laws reasonable.&#8221; I just appreciate his political influence. Little things like that I find here and there to do. Should I be more politically active? I don&#8217;t know.   CM: Well, that was my last question. Do you have any final thoughts?  MR: About political, about the politics, you mean? Or today&#8217;s politics?  CM: Do you have any final thoughts on anything we&#8217;ve discussed about the abortion rights issue throughout the last forty years? I guess more now. I guess forty-five years.  MR: I think the title of Howard Moody and Carmen&#8217;s book, From Illegal Act to Medical Practice, kind of says how I conceptualize it. From illegal act one on one, I mean, individual counseling and illegal act to through social change to medical practice and greater social justice. I mean, it&#8217;s that trajectory that has been very important to me to see. If you could stop that thing and let me think for thirty seconds.  (break in conversation)
MR: The issue is still alive on the Duke campus. My wife is the advisor to an intergenerational ethics course and I teach in the Duke Institute for Learning in Retirement, OLLI, Learning Learning. And these are particular courses where Duke students, honor students, and older members of OLLI who are usually retired meet together to talk about how do the different generations look at ethics, ethical issues. One of the ethical issues two classes ago was abortion and I would say that in general, the class, I can&#8217;t remember how we framed--. I spoke in that class about my experience. I&#8217;ve been to almost all the sessions of the class. I go with Betsy and I know some of the students and three of the older students are people who have been in my other classes and which I recruited for this class. So I spoke about my experience in this class. So I&#8217;m still out there in that extent. I would say most of the people in the class feel that abortion should be safe and legal. They don&#8217;t have any questions about it.   Most of them, here is the point I want to make, the only kind of &#8220;aha moment&#8221; on the part of the class because they were pretty well with it, especially in the stuff they&#8217;d read, was what I brought was statements and I sent them out to the class list ahead of time. I collected online these statements from most&#8212;here is my point. Most mainline religious church traditions today support the right of women to choose. And I collected these statements and sent them to the class, and people were surprised that, sure, most of the mainline churches, except for Catholics and the evangelicals and the Southern Baptists and a few, maybe a half dozen of these others, they&#8217;re the only ones that don&#8217;t support a woman&#8217;s right to choose. All the other mainline churches do. And when I sent that out and made this point in class, people were kind of surprised and I think that&#8217;s the point that I need to make and I had a chance in a class here to make it.   CM: That&#8217;s great.   MR: Yeah.  CM: Thank you very much.
