Jessica Wilkerson: Okay, so I&#8217;ll just introduce us first.
Bernadette McNabb: Okay.
JW: So this is Jessie Wilkerson and I&#8217;m with Bernie McNabb and the date is May 11, 2011. So I always like to start by-. Oh, first of all, can you say when and where you were born?
BM: Okay, I was born in 1948 in Rahway, New Jersey.
JW: Okay, and can you tell me about your childhood, who your parents were, and just your experience of growing up?
BM: Okay. My parents met when my dad was in the service in France. My mother&#8217;s French. My older sister was born in Germany. Then my parents came back to the States, and I was born in Rahway, New Jersey. After being in the States for a couple years my mother was terribly homesick, so my father reenlisted as a civilian working with the Air Force, so we went back to France and I had a wonderful childhood there. I have three younger brothers and an older sister and we were in France until the early [19]60s.
JW: So how old were you when you moved to France?
BM: Three.
JW: So most of your childhood was-.
BM: Was in France, and it was a great childhood because my grandparents were there, and we spent a lot of time with my grandparents during those years.
JW: Did your mother work?
BM: She did not.
JW: Well she had-
BM: Five children.
JW: -five children [Laughs] so she was busy.
BM: She was.
JW: So can you describe your relationship with your parents?
BM: I have a very, very good relationship to this day with my mother and a very good relationship with my dad, but my dad was an alcoholic. So that contributed to a lot of problems when we came back from France in the &#8217;60s. My mother thought that my father might do better being back in the United States since he was an American and was homesick so she was able to get my father a job with a French glass company that was opening a factory in Kingsport, Tennessee, or outside of Kingsport. So that&#8217;s how we came back to the States and how I got to Tennessee. So that was kind of a-it was a culture shock, to say the least, and the years in Kingsport, Tennessee were tough. My parents ended up getting a divorce when I was eighteen, my senior year in high school, and those were difficult years. We went from being upper middle-class in France and having a very comfortable lifestyle. The houses that we always lived in were provided by the Air Force, and so we had big houses and my grandparents were well to do. Then we came back to the States and my parents went through the divorce, or my father was having problems and was fired. He didn&#8217;t tell my mother until the day-. They gave him six months&#8217; notice and my mother didn&#8217;t know until the day that he-. And all the French families-we came with fifty-two French families-they all were looking at him; why is Th&#233;r&#232;se not unhappy? Th&#233;r&#232;se just didn&#8217;t know.   So my mother was faced with five children, a husband that was drinking heavily, and she had never worked, so those were tough years. She had to send two of my brothers back to France to live with grandparents. She chose to send my brothers back to France rather than us because the French school system is so much more advantaged than the Kingsport school system, so my sister and I would have been-. We would have had a very difficult time readjusting to the French school system so she sent my brothers back, and we could also help her more. So those were tough years with family being separated. It was hard on my brothers, it was hard on us.
JW: Did your mother get a job, or how did she support you all?
BM: She did. She went back to school. She started tutoring in French and then went back to school and finished a degree and started teaching school.
JW: And how old were you when you came to Kingsport?
BM: Thirteen.
JW: So probably late middle school or you started high school in Kingsport.
BM: Junior high, finished last year of junior high and then high school.
JW: So do you have memories of what that was like, coming to Kingsport and starting school there? Do you have any stories about that or recollections?
BM: I think it was scary. I can remember math class. In France there [were] no fractions. I didn&#8217;t know what fractions were. I was just overwhelmed, and I think they had to move me from that class into a lower level class so I could learn the basics of fractions. And my sister and I both had a strong French accent. We would spend hours practicing, because you know when you&#8217;re a teenager you don&#8217;t want to be different, so we spent hours practicing how not to have an accent, and now I can&#8217;t even fake one. [Laughs] I wish I could but I can&#8217;t.
JW: So what sort of accent were you trying to emulate?
BM: Not Tennessee.
JW: [Laughs]
BM: Not Southern; trying to just not have a French accent.
JW: So how did the other children react? Or I guess there were other-. Were there other French children who had moved there to work with this company?
BM: There were, but they didn&#8217;t go to the American schools. We knew that we were going to stay, okay, so the company brought a French teacher over to teach the French kids, and she&#8217;s here to this day. She&#8217;s a friend of my mother&#8217;s, and we see her regularly so she&#8217;s been here, what, fifty years.
JW: Wow. So how did-? Well and I guess at the school you were going to, was it pretty much local white kids from Kingsport?
BM: It was all local white kids from Kingsport, yeah. Kingsport desegregated their schools my senior year in high school.
JW: And do you remember what that process was like?
BM: I just remember that there was just a handful of black children, and certainly I didn&#8217;t feel uncomfortable with them. I was all for desegregation, and I couldn&#8217;t understand-. I mean I can remember seeing separate bathrooms, separate entrances to the movie houses in Kingsport. I just thought that was awful. I hadn&#8217;t experienced that in France. Not that there were a lot of black people where my grandparents were living but certainly there was not the discrimination that we saw here.
JW: So what did you do after graduating high school?
BM: I went to UT. That&#8217;s how I got to Knoxville; I came to UT. All my siblings came to UT because it was inexpensive, the state school. I majored in sociology, and at the very end I decided there were no jobs in sociology so I took a second major in French, not that I ever wanted to teach French. But that&#8217;s where I got my first job is teaching French in Gatlinburg, which I had sworn I would never go back to Gatlinburg because I worked there one summer.
JW: Okay. [Laughs]
BM: But that&#8217;s where I got the teaching job, so that&#8217;s where I went back to.
JW: And what year did you start UT?
BM: 1966.
JW: Okay, so what was going on at UT at that point?
BM: Well it was still very-. Women could not wear pants in UT-owned buildings so we had to wear skirts. It was a time when people still really dressed up to go to the ballgames. I think it was in &#8217;67 that we were allowed to wear pants to classes. Certainly the dorms, we had to be in the dorm by, I can&#8217;t remember, ten [o&#8217;clock], and you had to be in your room, off the phone, by 10:15. I mean there were still a lot of rules to be followed.
JW: For the women probably more than the men.
BM: For the women, yeah, none for the men. As far as I remember there was no curfews for the men. If you had a B average, I think, or a 2.0, you could stay out two nights. You had two late nights a quarter, maybe until 1:00 in the morning. I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but it was still very restrictive.
JW: Were women students starting to talk about that when you were there?
BM: Starting to. You know I was rather sheltered, and I guess I was a little shy so I wasn&#8217;t big in the-. I can remember the first people throwing bras and panties out the window.
JW: At UT?
BM: At UT, uh huh, and that was probably in-. Maybe we did that in &#8217;66. I don&#8217;t think so. I think that was really &#8217;67.
JW: And what was the reasoning [Laughs] for throwing the-?
BM: Well we were fighting to get-and I don&#8217;t know why we chose to throw bras, and actually I never did, but I think people were starting to say these curfews are not fair and we want equal rights.
JW: Were you aware of the civil rights movement occurring in Knoxville and elsewhere? Were you keeping up with that stuff?
BM: I really wasn&#8217;t. When I look back on it I think, why wasn&#8217;t I, but first of all we didn&#8217;t have a television in our dorm rooms, and I can&#8217;t even remember having a television downstairs in the lobby. We must have had, but I did not watch television at the time, and I guess I didn&#8217;t read newspapers. I just went to class, so I wasn&#8217;t real aware of all that was going on, even though I was a sociology major. I mean in some of the classes we talked about Martin Luther King and what he was trying to do but I was not involved in the movement.
JW: And what about the Vietnam War? Was there an awareness about that or did you notice any anti-war activities on campus?
BM: Certainly there was an awareness because there was the-what was it called?-the draft, excuse me, where men were having to put their-. Getting picked their-. I can&#8217;t even-. Men&#8217;s birthdays had to be-.
JW: Right.
BM: And there was the lottery where they were picking the--. So everybody was talking about, you know, what&#8217;s his number and that kind of thing when you were talking about your boyfriends, and certainly people concerned about having to go to Vietnam and how they might get out of it and that kind of thing.
JW: And were you dating in college?
BM: I was.
JW: And were any boyfriends drafted or talking about the war?
BM: Certainly, yeah, and not wanting to go and how they might, yeah, get out of it, and I knew several people that were conscientious [objectors] and left the country.
JW: So what about sex education, either in high school or once you were at college? What was the sex education you were getting, either formally or just by being on a college campus in the &#8217;60s?
BM: Okay. In the &#8217;60s, very little. Certainly I had no sex education at home, which surprises me now. People didn&#8217;t talk about it, and certainly in high school I don&#8217;t remember ever having a sex education class. I think the thought was, you know, we grew up okay and we didn&#8217;t get any sex education, but it was a much more na&#239;ve time. The rule then was, &#8220;nice girls don&#8217;t.&#8221;  I considered myself a nice girl, so I didn&#8217;t. And Catholic upbringing was pretty staunch, and I considered myself a good Catholic so those things. I was extremely na&#239;ve, and I think most of us were back in the &#8217;60s, until we started the different movements and until we started being aware of things. But even for me that was a slow awakening. I think it wasn&#8217;t until I went to graduate school that I really-. I can remember when I was teaching school I didn&#8217;t feel like I belonged anywhere. I didn&#8217;t belong in Gatlinburg. It was a very conservative environment and the teachers were extremely conservative, and my ex-husband was working at Lake Shore and all of those people were smoking pot and kind of out there and I didn&#8217;t belong in that group either. So it wasn&#8217;t until, yeah, early &#8217;70s that I tried to figure out, who am I? Where do I belong?
JW: So had you married right out of college or married during college?
BM: A year after college.
JW: Then when did you decide to go back to graduate school?
BM: I really didn&#8217;t like teaching. I didn&#8217;t like teaching in Gatlinburg. I&#8217;m not a disciplinarian and I&#8217;d much rather work one on one instead of in a large classroom, so that&#8217;s when I decided I needed to find a new career path. I stayed in Gatlinburg for three years because everybody talked about tenure, you have to have tenure, [Laughs] so I felt like I had to have tenure. I don&#8217;t know why I felt that because I didn&#8217;t want to stay in the profession, but I got tenure and then moved on.
JW: So you went back to UT in &#8217;70?
BM: &#8217;73. My son was born in &#8217;73 and I went back to school when he was two weeks old.
JW: Wow.
BM: I didn&#8217;t have time to wait. We didn&#8217;t have very much money so I needed to move on.
JW: So how did you juggle being a new mom and going back to school?
BM: Actually pretty well. I loved being a mom, I really did, and, yeah, I found graduate school challenging but not overly so, so it was okay.
JW: What did you do for child care?
BM: I had-. Again, see, the awareness now. We&#8217;re so much more careful these days, you know, but I had this woman in a little house that cared for six other children, but I don&#8217;t remember really, really looking at her qualifications. I just trusted, and as it turns out it was fine.
JW: So you went back to school for social work?
BM: No, it was actually ed psych and counseling.
JW: Okay. So you said you became more aware of these things when you went back for graduate school. What was that process like?
BM: Well there were a lot of encounter groups then. I can remember sitting in classes and people willing to look at their vaginas. I can&#8217;t even remember which class that was in, but there was a lot more awareness of bodies and self and, yeah, there was a lot of encounter groups.
JW: Can you say what-? I haven&#8217;t heard that phrase before, encounter group.
BM: We would sit in circles and talk about who we were and what we wanted and [18:05 chant some]. This was a UT class and I wasn&#8217;t terribly comfortable with it. I can remember somebody-. You had to share with another person what your impression of them was, and I can remember somebody telling me that I seemed kind of aloof and standoffish, which was not how I saw myself. But that was probably what I portrayed because again I was not comfortable with my own sexuality or body. My mother used to say that one of her biggest concerns about me growing up was how kind of prudish I was. I would hide in the closet to undress, and she was extremely concerned. Then she heard that I was a model and let doctors come and practice on my cervix and she was just like, whoa, how did you make that transition? For fitting of diaphragms, so I did make that transition somewhere in those years.
JW: So were you becoming more aware of a women&#8217;s movement?
BM: Oh, absolutely.

JW: Can you describe what you remember about that process, if there were certain books you were reading or interactions with people or organizations that you were-
BM: Involved in?
JW: -becoming aware of? Yeah.
BM: Well I think on some level-. You don&#8217;t know how things affect you, but back in the &#8217;60s I had two friends that had an illegal abortion and I went with one of them, and to this day I just thought how dehumanizing that is. How can we treat women this way and men not, or the men may not even be involved? Their illegal abortion luckily was performed by a doctor. It was in Knoxville, people knew he existed. He was on the corner of Hill Avenue. But I accompanied one of my friends there, and we sat in the car and they waved us in, or I didn&#8217;t go in, they wouldn&#8217;t allow me to go in, and she had to have so many one dollar bills, unmarked bills, so many five dollar bills, and it was five hundred dollars. I remember that stuck in my head. But the process was very dehumanizing and she went in, had a shot, came back and sat in the car, and then she said the nurse held her hand over her mouth so that she wouldn&#8217;t scream, so that&#8217;s probably the first real awareness that I thought life is not created equal here for us and for men. Then again that&#8217;s just a passing event, but somehow it had a profound impact on me.
JW: And do you know how people were learning about this physician? Was it just a word of mouth?
BM: I think it was just word of mouth. I do. I think that the police protected him. If we could find out then people knew he was there, but it was also a very shabby building and made you feel dirty.
JW: Did you think at that point that you were going to get more involved in eventually working in a clinic, or was that just something at the time that happened?
BM: It was just something at the time and, no, I never thought of even birth control. Yeah, I remember that I think I went and got birth control, and that probably had an impact on me too. I was not sexually active, but I&#8217;ve always been pretty responsible and I thought, well, if I&#8217;m going to be sexually active then I need to be protected. So I went to a doctor and I felt like I had to lie. I mean I did lie. I lied and said that my periods were extremely painful and that&#8217;s how I got birth control. At the time unmarried women were still not supposed to use birth control, and I think most of us still felt like we had to lie to get anybody to help us. So there was that awareness and you feel like that&#8217;s not right either. I was on the pill for almost a year before I told my partner, who became my husband, that I was on it because I felt like if he knew I was on it he&#8217;d pressure me to have sex, and I wasn&#8217;t ready. But when I was ready I&#8217;d be protected.
JW: Were there other things, like women&#8217;s studies classes or other things happening at UT that made you aware of the women&#8217;s movement?
BM: Again probably not so much in the &#8217;60s as in the &#8217;70s. There was more going on already on campus in the &#8217;70s, and that may be my not being aware.
JW: No, I think women&#8217;s studies started at UT in the early &#8217;70s, so it wouldn&#8217;t even have been there when you were an undergraduate at UT.
BM: Yeah.
JW: It was when you were a graduate student. Yeah, things changed quickly there. [Laughs]
BM: They did, they really did, from not being able to wear pants in a university-owned building to lack of curfews and mixed dorms.
JW: So what did you do once you had your-when you were looking for a job after getting your graduate degree, what did you do? Or I guess you said you worked some at Planned Parenthood? Was this a part of getting your degree?
BM: That was part of getting my degree. I had to do a couple of counseling practicums, and I did one at Maryville College and I did one at Planned Parenthood. And that&#8217;s where I got really interested in reproductive health and the movement and what was going on.
JW: Can you tell me a little bit about your experience working with Planned Parenthood?
BM: Well it was very small. It was myself and Ruth Martin, who&#8217;s been around for a long, long time. Now she&#8217;s with the office of aging. I gave pregnancy test results and saw how people reacted and was able to help them. At least abortion was legal in New York, and if that was something they wanted to look at how we could get them there, transportation and that kind of thing. So I thought it was very, very exciting work and I loved working with women individually or with their partner or families, so it was a very positive experience for me.
JW: And so how long after that did you start at the clinic?
BM: Well somebody through Planned Parenthood had told me there was a clinic opening and so I applied, but at that point the counseling director position had already been filled. It was a two-day a week position, and I couldn&#8217;t afford to take that, so I turned it down. I had applied for a job with civil service, and they had been waiting for me for a month to take this job. It was testing policemen and firemen, [Laughs] and I&#8217;d ridden in the back of a police car a couple times and I really didn&#8217;t want the job. But it was full time and it paid well, and I was going to have to take it. My father, who considered himself very Catholic, was here that weekend when Dick called and offered me this full time job, because the counseling director position had reopened. I felt terrible, and I remember talking to my dad. I didn&#8217;t tell him what the job was because I wasn&#8217;t sure that he would be supportive, and I said, &#8220;Dad, they&#8217;ve been waiting for me for a month but this is the job I really want,&#8221; and he said to me, &#8220;Bernie, these people won&#8217;t remember you in a month, so follow your dream and do what it is that you want to do.&#8221; That&#8217;s probably the only advice my father ever gave me as an adult but it was good advice.
JW: How did he react when he figured out what that job ended up being?
BM: He never did. He died shortly thereafter so he never did, and I think he would have been fine.
JW: How did your mother feel about it?
BM: She felt fine, she really did, because I was so enthusiastic about the job and I did a lot of sex education on the side and that kind of thing, and did with Planned Parenthood, and she felt that maybe my language needed to be toned down a little bit because it was very easy for me to talk about somebody&#8217;s penis and condoms and that kind of thing. [Laughs] I can remember going home and for her to say, &#8220;Maybe tone it down.&#8221; But other than that she&#8217;s always been very supportive.
JW: So can you describe what you remember about those first weeks or months of working at this new clinic, which was also part of a growing movement of clinics? It was a very new place.
BM: It was. For me it was exhilarating. I couldn&#8217;t have written a better job for myself. I loved working with the women, I loved working with the staff, it was new, you felt like you were part of a movement and no matter how difficult it was, because at first there weren&#8217;t that many picketers and it wasn&#8217;t until I guess the Right realized that this was here and it was going to stay that they started fighting back with such ugliness, is what I would see it as. But for me that job was ideal because one of my strong beliefs in life, that we don&#8217;t teach very well, is taking personal responsibility for decisions we make and the life we create for ourselves and with this I felt that this is a true avenue where you can teach that or where you can help women realize that, and certainly not in every case, and some people will never be terribly responsible people. But we can determine our destiny to some extent, and I think that&#8217;s real important. I think that for me, when I look at how all this evolved for me, is that I watched my mother struggle with five children and I thought, I will never let that happen to me. I knew that I could raise one decent human being to be a good person but beyond that I didn&#8217;t know-. With Dick I might have been able to, but with my first husband, he was not very helpful and I was pretty much on my own. So that was a choice I made, and I reflect with my siblings that out of five of us my sister has three children, but the rest of us just had one pregnancy. And I think that is all because of what we saw with my parents as far as how tough it is. And you can choose to have three or four children or you can not make the decision and not have very good control of your life, or the life of your children. That&#8217;s why being pro-choice to me is so very, very, very important, and that doesn&#8217;t mean-. You know people will say you&#8217;re pro-abortion, I mean we&#8217;ve all heard those things, and that is not-. I have no need to control anybody else&#8217;s life. I think that women need to be able to look at all three options that they have and make responsible decisions concerning themselves and their families.
JW: And was that pretty much the philosophy or ideas that you had going into it or is that something you developed over time?
BM: I think it was probably always in my core, but I think I developed it more and more over time and seeing how some people are unable to make decisions. They&#8217;re influenced by religion, they&#8217;re influenced by their own genetic makeup, but they&#8217;re unable to make responsible decisions. They would rather life just happened for them than to take control.
JW: So after the clinic opened and you were seeing women, how were they responding to this new legal service? What were your experiences working with these women in the &#8217;70s?
BM: I think that most women were very happy about having choices, of not having to-. Certainly pre-legalization it was dehumanizing. It was degrading, something that you shouldn&#8217;t feel guilty about. You were made to feel guilty and ashamed, and when it became legal even though some women still had that those feelings it was far less so, far less so. The outside world or the antis would make you want to go back to that feeling of degradation, but because it was legal there was far less of that.
JW: And do you recall any of those first women who came in? Do you have memories of those patients?
BM: Not the first, but I do have memories of certain women that just left an impact. Sometimes it&#8217;s a very, very difficult decision for people, I mean a lot of times it&#8217;s a difficult decision. One woman wanted to be pregnant more than anything, and then she did get pregnant and found out that her brother needed a kidney transplant and she was the only possible donor. He could have gone on dialysis but she chose to terminate the pregnancy, and for her that was agonizing. I mean there were not numerous cases like that but there&#8217;s a lot of cases where it really is an agonizing decision to have to make.
JW: So the other day when we were talking, I think Corinne had brought this up, that when women come to the clinic they are getting services there but also people can be educated while they&#8217;re there as well, either about women&#8217;s health or other things, so can you say more about that and what the mission is, and that may be too strong of a word, but this idea of educating people as they&#8217;re coming in for services?
BM: Well just even the basic idea that with any pregnancy a woman has three choices, okay? She can carry the pregnancy to term and parent, or she can carry the pregnancy to term and give it up for adoption, or she can terminate the pregnancy. I mean some people don&#8217;t even look at those three options and what those three options mean in your life. What will your life be like, or can you project what your life might be like, if you carry the pregnancy to term? How will you manage? Or how do you think you&#8217;ll feel if you carry this pregnancy to term and give it up for adoption? Can you imagine what those feelings might be? Can you imagine what you might feel if you terminate the pregnancy and what are the ramifications there? So just even in those discussions you&#8217;re asking somebody to really look at what each one will mean. Not everybody can be-especially teenagers. You know teenagers, I can remember one mother saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to have a Twinkie baby,&#8221; and I couldn&#8217;t figure out what she was saying. Finally when the mother stopped crying and I said can you tell me what that means, she said, &#8220;All she&#8217;s had to eat for the last six months is Twinkies and Cokes,&#8221; so that&#8217;s what she meant by Twinkie baby. This thirteen-year-old, she was thirteen and the mother was frustrated. She had one daughter who was fourteen and had had a baby, and the mother was working two jobs and she had two teenaged girls who were pregnant and with teenagers the moment to educate-. I mean it&#8217;s hard to educate in a very short amount of time, but her mother said, how are you going to support this baby? Well, Joey has a job at the gas station. He makes three dollars an hour, and for a teenager that&#8217;s a lot of money.   So all along there are ways, depending on who the person is and what their needs are, to at least provide a little education, whether it&#8217;s on birth control and being responsible about using birth control when this is over, if she chooses to terminate the pregnancy or carry to term. So there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities in a counseling session, and we&#8217;re not forcing anybody [to take] the information but there sometimes are teachable moments.
JW: So how were you getting educated yourself about how to be a good counselor?
BM: The wonderful thing about this kind of counseling is that it&#8217;s very short term and there&#8217;s an outcome rather than it being long term therapy. This is very short, and you have to ask a lot of questions, more so than any other kind of counseling, because you have to get to the root of the problem or what the person is thinking or needs. But what I liked about it is you can really help a person in a short amount of time come to terms with what they needed to do and what was best for them. When it was over, if a person did choose to have an abortion, the biggest emotion is relief that it&#8217;s over with, that it&#8217;s behind them, but then there&#8217;s a lot of other feelings too. There&#8217;s a sense of relief but there&#8217;s also some guilt and there&#8217;s a mix, again depending on what that person&#8217;s situation is.
JW: And were you coming into contact with-I&#8217;ve heard some people call themselves feminist counselors. Did you consider yourself a feminist counselor or was that something you were thinking about or meeting other people?
BM: No, I&#8217;ve never considered myself a feminist counselor and I&#8217;m not sure what exactly that-.
JW: Some people from the Sexual Assault Crisis Center have called themselves that, and that center really grew out of a feminist movement so it was set up as a-. It was kind of an activist community that set it up. I couldn&#8217;t exactly tell you how they defined being a feminist counselor that&#8217;s all that different from just being a counselor.
BM: I think that with the Sexual Assault Crisis Center there tends to be more of an anger, and I think it&#8217;s well-founded in that somebody has been violated to that extreme. So I can see why they would see themselves as more ardent feminists. [Interruption] Where I&#8217;ve never had that anger. I mean I&#8217;ve never had that edginess of I&#8217;m a feminist and I&#8217;m going to fight you to the-. Does that make sense?
JW: Mm hmm.
BM: I have always considered myself a feminist but a quiet feminist in that I&#8217;ve always felt like I could get things done better in a mild manner than if I was angry. I don&#8217;t know if that makes sense.
JW: Yeah, it does. When did you start to consider yourself a feminist?
BM: Probably in graduate school.
JW: And was that because of what you were learning in these classes and encounter groups?
BM: That and I mean there is discrimination to this day. Women make less money than men for the same jobs. Those kinds of things I&#8217;ve always seen myself as a feminist.
JW: So you had mentioned the three or four days of training you did in New York?
BM: Mm hmm.
JW: So were there other resources like that that you were able to tap into, or workshops, or anything like that?
BM: Well the training in New York, you know certainly I had a counseling background from graduate school, but it was learning how to do short term counseling with different kinds of patients. Patients are definitely different. Our youngest patient was eleven; our oldest was fifty-one at the clinic, so you see a wide variety. Some people are married and others are not and some people are in long term relationships so you see a wide array. So it was important for me to see how to do short term counseling and counseling with parents as well. You know a lot of parents want to force their minors into an abortion, but you have to help them see that if that&#8217;s the perception of the minor then she&#8217;s going to act out in some other way and be pregnant again three months from now if that&#8217;s what she chooses. So the parents really need to be listening to the minor, trying to help them rather than forcing them. That&#8217;s difficult to do as a parent because you feel like you know what&#8217;s best for your child, and you don&#8217;t want to be saddled with the responsibility of a child and you know the impact it can have on your teenager, but what we saw is that if a parent forces the child into an abortion-.
JW: It seems like such a unique counseling experience. So were you just kind of learning out there as you encountered it?
BM: Absolutely, and then when you-. Yeah, you had to do your best counseling with each individual person, as you encountered it, yeah, so it was a learning curve. I have good listening skills, and I have good people skills. But it was a learning experience, but I loved it. I always felt that I was being helpful and certainly not harmful, and again because I feel like it is that person&#8217;s responsibility to make a good decision. You can give them all the information so that they have the ability to make the decision, but in the end it&#8217;s their decision.
JW: So how has working at the clinic affected your relationship with other people in the community? I&#8217;m thinking about this because Corinne had told me a story in the interview I did with her about staff going to get car loans, or being at a certain church or something and it becoming an issue, or people have misconceptions and misinformation, and you&#8217;re talking to staff about how to respond and how to deal with that, so I wonder if you have personal experiences of living in Knoxville, which is a Bible Belt town, [Laughs] and what those experiences were and how you dealt with them.
BM: You know, amazingly, not a whole lot. I guess all my life I&#8217;ve put myself in the position where I don&#8217;t let people judge me. I mean I didn&#8217;t join a sorority. One, I didn&#8217;t have the money but I would not join a sorority because I&#8217;m not willing to let somebody decide whether I&#8217;m good enough or not good enough, and I think that carries through this as well. I&#8217;m not going to confront you or I&#8217;m not going to be in your face about the abortion issue. I mean I&#8217;ll calmly state what I feel. Does that make sense?
JW: Yeah.
BM: I try not to go where somebody is going to say you&#8217;re good enough or not good enough and I feel that way about the abortion issue. I think it&#8217;s a very private issue, and if you don&#8217;t like what I have to say, so be it. I&#8217;m okay with that.
JW: I think what Corinne was referring to was when someone would say, well where do you work, and people would have to write where they worked and then people would take that opportunity to say, oh, you work at that abortion clinic, and then take that opportunity to say they didn&#8217;t agree with it, or forcing their own-.
BM: Their own opinion. Truthfully I didn&#8217;t run across that very much. I mean I did not go out of my way to say where I worked or what I did, again possibly because I don&#8217;t want to be judged, but, no, overall I was very proud of where I worked and what I did. If I had to say, did I get more positive reinforcement from the people who knew it than negative, but again I&#8217;m not in a church and I&#8217;m not-.
JW: So the years when the protests did pick up in Knoxville, how did you-? We&#8217;d already talked about how you all created kind of a little fortress in the Fort [Sanders neighborhood] which I think is perfect. [Laughs] But it still must have been really stressful, just to encounter these things occurring around you, so how did you deal with it on a personal level?
BM: I had to be strong because I was the leader and so I tried not to show the stress but it was there. I know we had our phone unpublished because we didn&#8217;t want any calls. During the worst of the picketing, and it was awful, we got a phone call one night saying that we were going to die, which put me in a panic. Also we had gotten a bomb and anthrax at the same time, and then I get this phone call that you were going to die, and then [Laughs] within a week there was a boat every Friday morning with five men reading the Bible outside of our living room. To this day I do not know if it was connected. I don&#8217;t know. But the phone call, I mean I called the FBI. We were working with the FBI on the anthrax, and they followed it up. As it turns out it was somebody at Farragut High School that had taken their mother&#8217;s cell phone and was randomly phoning his friends, so the FBI showed up on this family&#8217;s doorstep. The parents were appalled, and they didn&#8217;t know that their son had taken the-but as it turns out it was not directed at us. But that&#8217;s how stressed I was, I mean to think that you&#8217;re going to die is all related to the abortion issue, and that&#8217;s how it felt. And the men reading the Bible outside on a float boat. We haven&#8217;t seen them in a long time, but I have no idea if that was connected or not. So you&#8217;re super aware of your environment and your-. You know, as we talked the other day, it was at the time that they were bombing clinics and they were shooting doctors and so you never felt-and I also felt the responsibility of protecting the staff. You hate to ask somebody to come to work and have them in harm&#8217;s way, like the nurse in Alabama, so that was stressful as well.
JW: Were you director? Or I guess what year did you become director at the clinic?
BM: I was trying to think-&#8217;82 or &#8217;83? In that period.
JW: So you were director when things were getting more heated.
BM: Yes.
JW: So how did you lead the staff and help to allev[iate] the stress that the protesting would have caused?
BM: Well we talked a lot. I mean we had to talk it out and talk about our fears and what we were concerned about and also talked about safety, make sure that you&#8217;re aware of where you are and who&#8217;s parked around you and that kind of thing. And then picketers were inciting-. There was two other things that you had to be aware of. You had to be aware that the staff might want to thrash out at some of these picketers, okay, and you had to be aware of the partners and parents of some of the patients that were coming in wanting to beat somebody up on the sidewalk when they were yelling threatening things. So it was reinforced that the protestors have a right to be there, and that was real hard for patients to understand and for partners. We had to hire a security guard to make sure that nobody was hurt because that&#8217;s all-. The picketers really wanted somebody to, yeah, so that they could charge them with something, and we had that happen once. A picketer charged one of the staff members of trying to run him over, and it was a big drama and he brought charges, so there was all that legal stuff to deal with as well. We had several years that were extremely difficult.
JW: So who would you say have been your allies in this work?
BM: A lot of times it&#8217;s felt very lonely. There&#8217;s a few churches that have been supportive, certainly there&#8217;s a few doctors that have been supportive and refer their patients, but overall not a whole lot. I mean the health department, the nurses aren&#8217;t allowed or the counselors are not allowed to say &#8220;abortion.&#8221; We heard that some people would open the phone book and point. So there&#8217;s always some activity on trying to restrict it or-. That&#8217;s always been real hard for me to understand because it is a legal service, and if we&#8217;re responsible people we need to tell the truth and help people determine what&#8217;s best for them rather than thinking that we have the power, and that I have a real hard time with. I have a hard time with the health department or hospitals feeling like abortion is wrong, a pharmacist feeling like abortion is wrong, and therefore they will not give the information. Just from a human standpoint I just think that&#8217;s terrible, that you would affect that kind of outcome. And I think there&#8217;s a misperception of what abortion clinics do. At least certainly we never have-. If the person doesn&#8217;t want to be there or they feel like somebody else is making them we send them home. It is not in our best interest or the patient&#8217;s best interest to force them into what we think is right for them. They need to come to terms with what&#8217;s right for them. So back to your question, not a whole lot of support out there.
JW: So the health departments couldn&#8217;t refer patients?
BM: At some point they decided that they could not.
JW: And they still to this day cannot or do not do that?
BM: We don&#8217;t get referrals from the health department unless there&#8217;s a sympathetic nurse out there, but overall, no, they don&#8217;t cover the three options that you might have with a pregnancy.
JW: That&#8217;s incredible. So what have been the most successful moments for you in your career, or the moments that you&#8217;re most proud of?
BM: I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s a moment. If I look back I&#8217;m really proud of the work the clinic has done. I think that we have been a really good clinic, and we&#8217;ve done really good work. And if I have to say that I&#8217;ve nurtured enough young counselors along and stayed in contact with them then I feel like I have an impact on their lives and their career choices and how to be a good boss. Yeah, it is truly a career that I look back on that was very, very rewarding for me.
JW: And being in this career, did it raise your awareness about other issues in the community?
BM: Oh, certainly. I&#8217;m a staunch Democrat and I consider myself liberal and progressive and so all of the issues that affect us that have a negative impact on making progress and moving along and helping people who need help, and I have a very, very hard time with that. So, yeah, I read a lot and I send quite a few letters to our politicians, not that I feel like that&#8217;s terribly effective, and I belong to several organizations like Emily&#8217;s List and some of those so, yeah, I do keep up with what&#8217;s happening.
JW: Could you say what the other organizations are that you belong to?
BM: I still keep up with NAF and NARAL and Emily&#8217;s List and I do some work with Second Harvest. I was on the board of the ACLU but resigned.
JW: So it strikes me that the clinic was-. Dick and I talked about this a little bit and he said you were the expert on the numbers and all that, but that it was a regional clinic because there were people coming from not just east Tennessee or not just Knoxville but from other places as well. Can you say a little bit about how the clinic has served a broader area, and why you think that&#8217;s the case?
BM: Certainly we&#8217;d get people as far as Nashville and Kentucky. There are not many abortion providers, and there&#8217;s getting fewer and fewer. In Tennessee there&#8217;s two clinics in Nashville; there&#8217;s no longer one in Chattanooga; and two clinics in Memphis, as far as I know, and that&#8217;s it.
JW: And two-are there two in Knoxville?
BM: Two in Knoxville, yeah, and so people have to-. There are so many counties that are not served so they have to come from far away. Also, and it&#8217;s not a small thing, but we have [     ]. I don&#8217;t know if you met [     ]. She is one of the most-. She&#8217;s been there for years. She came there and had an abortion early on and then applied for a job and she was-I should not have said that.
JW: We can [59:57 restrict it].
BM: [Restrict it], okay. But anyway, she has been fantastic. She can tell people hop on the bus from Indiana and they&#8217;ll hop on a bus. She is that-. She&#8217;s incredible with people and people trust her, and they walk in the clinic and they [ask for her] and she&#8217;s been doing that for years. You would think she&#8217;d burn out. So if people are shopping around for a clinic and they get [     ] on the phone in all likelihood they&#8217;re going to come because of her, and that&#8217;s amazing that a person can do-.
JW: And is she from Knoxville?
BM: I think she was from [another place] originally, but she&#8217;s been with the clinic since she turned-I think she was twenty-two and now she&#8217;s close to fifty. And we have staff members that have been there for a long, long time, and that&#8217;s good because it provides continuity.
JW: It shows you&#8217;re doing something right. [Laughs] You&#8217;re running the place well. Let&#8217;s see. Well I don&#8217;t think I have any other questions. Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about or any other themes that you wanted to touch upon?
BM: I don&#8217;t think so. I truly, truly hope that there will be no further restrictions on abortion, I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s not going to be the case, because in no way do the restrictions help. Imposing a twenty-four hour or forty-eight hour does not help; it makes things much worse.
JW: Can you say how it makes things worse?
BM: Several ways. One, you know, most-. [Break in recording from 1:02:08 to 1:02:21] So their employer is questioning it, if the woman is not able to tell her partner or her husband about the pregnancy, yeah, that puts her-. We&#8217;ve heard of abuse cases over it and that kind of thing. The twenty-four hours just does not work. At one point the doctor had to do all the counseling so we had to get the informed consent part of the counseling, which is explaining the procedure, the risk, so that a woman can again make a responsible decision, but we had to get the doctor to do it. Well our doctor, Dr. Mueller, was kind of a shy-nice, wonderful man but he was shy and he had a little bit of a bobbing head, and so women had to come in, watch Dr. Mueller, and then go home and wait, and it was not the most effective way of doing it and the patients were not counseled and they were a little concerned about Dr. Miller&#8217;s head bobbing, [Laughs] and it was not-.
JW: When was that restriction in place?
BM: Some time around the Casey decision, when the Supreme Court said that states could pass regulation as long as it was not an undue burden, so they were trying to decide what was an undue burden and the ACLU came and helped us defend it. Women did not have to get spousal consent, parental consent stayed on the books, the waiting period did not, and we fought against the doctor having to do the informed consent, so that no longer stands. But those times were very difficult and it did not help women, it really, really did hinder them.
JW: And I think that when people keep talking about these restrictions more recently they talk about them as though people have never experienced them before, it would be a new thing, but your history shows that you already had to do this and it was a bad idea then.
BM: It was a bad idea, and I mean we&#8217;ve had all different kinds of restrictions come up. At one point there was one, both parents had to sign, and some of the teenagers didn&#8217;t even know who their fathers were but somehow we had to try to locate the parent and have two parent signatures. That one was thrown out pretty quickly but the one parent stayed on. Yeah, so as a clinic worker it was very frustrating because the laws were changing and you had to rearrange your staffing and who&#8217;s going to do the informed consent and that kind of-. Yeah, so staffing was much more difficult.
JW: How would you be notified that these laws had changed and that you had to comply by a certain period?
BM: Well the Casey decision came over the Supreme Court, so if I remember correctly those laws were re-imposed immediately. The ones that were already on the books in Tennessee were re-imposed immediately as of that next week and so we had to deal with that, and that&#8217;s when both the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy and ACLU came and helped us fight those, and those people, talk about support. Those two organizations were extremely supportive, sent lawyers down at no cost and the lawyers would work practically twenty-four hours a day and were very, very effective and very bright people. So I&#8217;m glad that those two organizations are still in existence and they go all over the country trying to squash these regulations. I&#8217;d be for [the restrictions] if I felt that they were helpful, but they&#8217;re neither helpful for the patients or for the clinics trying to provide the service, and most of them are coming from men.   The one that they&#8217;re trying to pass now, all abortion patients will have to have an ultrasound and they have to show the patient the pictures, at the clinic we ended up doing ultrasounds on all patients just because we want to know exactly where they are. When we first started ultrasounds didn&#8217;t exist so the doctor had to do it all by the way it feels, and so you did have more problems because doctors were not always a hundred percent right about how far the pregnancy was. With ultrasound you know exactly, so we did ultrasounds on all patients and if the patient wants to see the picture, the patient wants to know if there&#8217;s a heartbeat, we tell them. I mean we&#8217;re not trying to hide the fact that you&#8217;re pregnant, and we can tell them exactly how far along they are and we do, because we feel like they need to know too what they&#8217;re dealing with. So it&#8217;s a fallacy that we&#8217;re a secret and we&#8217;re trying to, as they call us sometimes, abortion mills, trying to hide and force women into, and not giving them the information they need. That&#8217;s not the case.
JW: And that must be so frustrating to hear all the misinformation that just gets on the news and in the media and that people just have about the process.
BM: It is frustrating.
JW: And the politicians [1:08:53 throw out there.]
BM: Yeah, it is frustrating, and to me the worst is what they call the partial-birth abortion, because those women are not, as we talked before, they&#8217;re not having abortions because they don&#8217;t want stretch marks. Their fetus is not viable or-yeah. And it&#8217;s not a question of they&#8217;re doing this for vanity. They&#8217;re doing it because their doctor feels it is the best procedure to conserve their fertility, or-. But the misinformation that was out there and the gruesome pictures, and the general public believes it and the general public supported that it should be outlawed, and I feel strongly that it should be between a woman and her doctor.
JW: Well is their anything else that you would like to cover? This has been wonderful. I thank you so much.
BM: You&#8217;re welcome. I feel like I&#8217;ve talked in circles but-.
JW: No, no.
BM: I hope it goes well for you.
