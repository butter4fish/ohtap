Jessica Wilkerson: This is Jessie Wilkerson, and I&#8217;m with Polly Murphy.  And it is May 25, 2010.  So my first question, Polly, is.  Well, I&#8217;ll ask you: what is your childhood history?  Where did you grow up, can you tell me a little about your family, so we can start there.  Polly Murphy: Okay.  I did not grow up in the South; I grew up, actually I was born in Salem, Massachusetts, very Boston Irish Catholic family.  And we moved when I was young.  My dad was actually a Boston cop, worked at the GE in Lynn, and then World War Two came, and he was overseas, and I was a baby boomer who came.  I have an older sister who was born during the war, and then he was gone for four and a half years, and then I have a sister and I were like Irish twins.  Because we were a year apart, right after the war, when they came back.    But then they moved to Long Island.  My dad did landscaping, and back in that time Long Island was like the Great Gatsby, all these great places.  So he was doing a lot of that, and we lived right on the bay, and he also did a lot of clamming, you know?  He was a big clammer.  And earned money that way too, you know.  So I had a good childhood.  I mean, I really did.  It was.  I kind of think I yearn to be back with all of my cousins; I have like twenty cousins on one side of my family, my mom&#8217;s side of my family, so you know we would go back to Massachusetts three or four times a year, and I just loved it.  We would be with all the cousins and they&#8217;d come down some and stuff too, but.    I generally had an insignificant childhood, I think.  I had polio, which was a thing that was for a while, but it was in a hard time, it was a hard-hit place on Long Island, and a lot of kids got it.  So my next-door neighbor and I were together, and he died, which was really awful.  And we had shared a lollipop because he had a sore throat, so it was just this&#8212;so I did get it, but I got over it.  They had pumped me up with everything they could when he died.  And other kids, the family behind our house, was paralyzed.  There were some significant hard things like that, sorting out.  But I would say it was like an average working-class family.  JW: Did your mom work?  PM: My mom did, actually.  She tried to go back.  My mom ended getting an RN, which was a big deal in her family.  And it was finished up when my dad was finishing, and he went back on the GI bill and went to school.  But then she really had the main, solid thing.  She was home when we were very little and she tried to go back to work, but I got sick a couple of times with some significant things.  And she would have to quit, because it would be like this hospitalization or whatever.  By the time I was in first grade, she went back and worked as a nurse.  Before that, she worked with sick people going to their house, or something like that.  So she pretty much worked most of the time.    It was a small town, and there were a couple of elementary schools.  It was significant to me that we were not--.  There were a lot of Puerto Rican and Italian immigrant first-generation family, and a lot of the kids did not speak English yet.  And we all went to the same school.  You know, it&#8217;s funny, they say &#8220;Did your parents choose to let you stay at that school, versus moving you to a different school where most of the kids spoke English?&#8221; But no, they never considered it.  It was just the bus picked you up there, and that&#8217;s where you went to school.  It ended up [being] a very good thing for me, because from a very early age, I can remember.  It was the fifties.  I can remember how teachers responded to kids.  Like, condescending and impatient, or talking louder, you know?  When you&#8217;re six years old you&#8217;re thinking: they can hear you, they can&#8217;t understand you.  It was like, &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;   There were a lot of good friends.  The first guy that was a young boyfriend, but a good friend too, it was Enzo Moribito.  And he didn&#8217;t speak English through a lot of that year.  I guess it was about third-fourth grade.  We were very good friends, all the way through.  That was a big deal.  We grew up by the ocean, very important to me, there was a lot of that.  And my sisters, and there&#8217;s everybody&#8217;s dynamics of families.  And sisters, or siblings, are the influence of that.  I was the youngest of three; my sister was in the middle but we were very close.  Or it was always like Jean and the kids.  It was almost like &#8220;during the war, post war,&#8221; because we were together all the time.  I think I&#8217;ve lucked out that we all stay very close, and we probably talk to each other every week.  I&#8217;m sixty-two, and they&#8217;re up North at this point.  I think I&#8217;m the closest to both of them; I get along with both of them very well.  My middle sister had a hard time being in the middle, too, with the oldest.    My older sister always beat to her own drum, and she&#8217;s very, very gifted, bright, and so she never fit in as well.  She graduated at sixteen, &#8216;cause we first lived in a small place where&#8212;I was not in school yet&#8212;but it was two grades in one classroom, and she could easily listen to both sides and move up and move up.  She had no problem with any of that.  And they wanted to keep doing it, and mother said &#8220;No, no, she&#8217;s young!&#8221; [Laughter] Back at that time, I don&#8217;t think it was addressed that much for her.  It was tough for her.  She really helped me, all the way through growing up.  And she was very much a feminist, very much politically an activist; she went to school at Barnard and Columbia.    She was sixteen and she wanted to go to Georgetown, and she had gone to Catholic school.  She had gone to Catholic school until her senior year, and because she was a girl they wouldn&#8217;t let her take advanced calculus, and advanced physics and all these things.  And she left.  She went to the public school her last year.  Taking all this stuff.  So then she went on to col--.  All the priests and everybody in Washington said she&#8217;s too young to go away, she should stay close to home, so they sent her to New York City.  And again, I think my parents [were] not really understanding how all of that worked.  That was when I was [in], sixth grade, seventh grade, and that was the first time I saw New York City.  We were like seventy-five miles away, and everybody says, &#8220;How could that be?&#8221;  And I was thinking, my mama was from Massachusetts and had three little children. I could see how she didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go into New York City!&#8221; She didn&#8217;t.  [Laughter]   JW: Right.  PM: But Jean got--.  That was the first time I saw it, and I remember all those buildings and everything.  Then they were saying &#8220;Where&#8217;s her dorm?&#8221; And they said &#8220;Dorm?  Oh, we ran out of dorms a while ago.  But we&#8217;ve got her up in this hotel over on 93rd Street, or something.&#8221;  JW: Oh gosh.  PM: That&#8217;s how that went from there.  So she&#8217;d spent a lot of time talking to me, and as a result, in high school, I started thinking about things more.  At the same time, I was a totally typical kid.  I really was.  I didn&#8217;t like school that much.  I was a very average student, but I also could tell Jean was so bright they didn&#8217;t want to compare; I don&#8217;t think they were always saying &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;  I was thinking: this is cool, I can just glide along.  [Laughter]  But then I didn&#8217;t want to go right to college.  I wanted to join VISTA, and it was the whole time of VISTA, and my parents really wanted me to get something they could see.  I was the one they worried about, as far as not--.  JW: So where did VISTA send you?  PM: Well, what happened is my parents really wanted me to go to even a two-year program or something, and I didn&#8217;t want to, and there was this tension.  And my sister mediated a little bit.  She knew a friend, Bill Wells, who worked with the Appalachian Volunteers at this point.  She had been one of the early freedom riders down in Mississippi down in the first years, and she went down and did a lot of civil rights work during that time.  And met a lot of people who went on.  They were good all friends; some of them went on to work in the VISTA program, directors of different states and everything.    She said &#8220;Well listen, I have this good friend, Bill Wells, who is out living in Morehead, Kentucky, and there is a college there also, and he is working with college students.  But also full-time volunteers and all.  And what if she goes to school there, and she can do that as a student there.&#8221;   And they said okay.  And I applied and I went.  But then I couldn&#8217;t find this Bill Wells.  And I was still like, going to church, you know what I mean?  [Laughter]  I was really homesick.  I remember the first time I called home.  I said &#8220;Mom, a lot of people down here, they put mayonnaise on a hamburger.&#8221;  I remember that&#8217;s one of the first things I was going, wow.  It&#8217;s because she was such a New England cook.    Then at one point after Mass, I was talking to the priest, and I said &#8220;My sister has a good friend, Bill Wells, and I really would like to find him.&#8221; He said &#8220;Oh, he lives out of town.&#8221; I said &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go see him.&#8221; I thought I&#8217;d go see him, and he was telling me where, but I don&#8217;t think he was thinking I was walking.  So it was like eight or nine miles.  [Laughter]  JW: And you walked it.  PM: I did, I did.  There was this little trailer, and he opened it up, and I said &#8220;I am Jeanie Murphy&#8217;s little sister.&#8221; [Laughter]  And he looked around, he said &#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221;  But that really started an interest in that, and I became an Appalachian Volunteer while I was in school.  Then I stayed on for the next year.  First I was in East Kentucky, and then I was in West Virginia.  And that&#8217;s where I stayed, in West Virginia.    It was a funny time.  The Appalachian Volunteers is a whole other thing.  On some levels there was a lot of strong women, right, and there was a lot of stuff going on.  But then there was a lot of yucky stuff with guys, these young intellectual guys who were hitting [on] all these young women who were coming in.  And were just yucky.  As far as that, I always felt like there was this hands-off thing with me because I was Jean&#8217;s sister, and Bill Wells.  Everybody talked about all this sexuality, all this stuff going on, and I missed it all.  I was just in my community, doing my stuff, and we&#8217;d go to meetings.  JW: But you had a sense of it with other women?  PM: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I did.  It was--.  JW: So it was that men didn&#8217;t respect them?  Or there was--.  PM: Yeah.  There was a lot of cross-purposes as far as a lot of guys who were talking a lot of political active stuff, but were certainly not feeling that with respect to women.  Picking at different volunteers, and who they were going to try to get in bed, you know, whatever.  I still think I was not quite, I certainly wasn&#8217;t a grownup; I was eighteen, nineteen.  I wasn&#8217;t a mature&#8212;I was a very spontaneous, I just sort of did the next thing.  But I really loved being a volunteer.  A VISTA volunteer.  I really felt like that was an important part of my life.    JW: So what did you do as a volunteer, or what area were you working in?  PM: Mainly, when I was in school, it was different because it was East Kentucky.  I think it was really&#8212;I mean I felt like it was exhilarating, and spending whole weekends.  Sue Koback?  Do you know Sue?  JW: I don&#8217;t know her, but I know who she is.    PM: She was a senior at Morehead when I was a freshman.  So as soon as I got to know Bill Wells, he linked me up with Sue.  She was my buddy, and I would do stuff with her on the weekends up there.  Then when I went full-time and lived with a family, it was all the difference in the world.  As far as the continuity, and getting to know everybody.  It was also real clear I had a future with kids, young kids.  That seemed like such an easy means to getting families together, and to getting parents to come to a group, if you had some thing going.    We used an old one-room schoolhouse.  And started a program; it was in the summer when I started there.  There was a lot of family  support to get it going.  Kids are not hard for me.  I did stuff with kids during the day, but we did a lot of putting on plays, doing things like that, that the parents came to.    They were all miners, and it was a coal camp.  It was the trains in Mingo, West Virginia, and the train went right through the town.  So when it was there and stopped, it completely stopped everything.  You couldn&#8217;t get on either side and it was like this big thing, because they would hit each other and bang into each other, so it was a really big thing not to scoot under the cars or under --.That was where I was between the kid and the adult, because I would just lose patience, I would fall on the side of the kids.  We would all look out, so you could go under get to the other side of the train, on the other side of it where something&#8217;s going on.  I&#8217;m not sure.  I think I was bonded with a lot of people there, but looking back at my age, I don't know how grown-up they saw me, in that way.  But I do think it was [an] easy time for me with people, and there was certainly a lot of community talk going on, and people got more comfortable to go to other meetings.  Talking about strip mining, talking about a lot of things.  Then comes chapter two.  At that time, I went to a meeting with the volunteers during the year.  The Kentucky director, his name is Michael Klein, who was, and still is, a folk singer and does a lot of documentaries with oral histories.  He&#8217;s a wonderful guy; he&#8217;s right up your alley.  Um.  We just got married.  [Laughter] We did, that&#8217;s sort of how--.  JW: You just met and got married.  PM: I didn&#8217;t&#8212;well no, no.  But essentially there wasn&#8217;t a lot of; I wasn&#8217;t thinking very much.  JW: You were young.  PM: That&#8217;s right.  We had a good time.  He was pursuing me for sure.  Bill Wells had gone to England, because I think it probably wouldn&#8217;t have happened otherwise.  So we had this good time, and then he really pursued me, and at some point we&#8212;when I left, at the end of the year I was going, left the Appalachian Volunteers.  And I went to school in Buffalo, New York.  I really didn&#8217;t have money; it made a difference, because I could go and get the state scholarships and stuff.  Why&#8217;d I go to Buffalo, I don't know.  It was just one of those times in my life.    So I did.  But I got there well after--.  I remember I was still just being a volunteer and somebody, Bill Wells, saying &#8220;Didn&#8217;t school start in Buffalo, New York?&#8221; and I said &#8220;I think so.&#8221; I remember them putting me on a plane, and I went to Buffalo.  Of course there was no place to stay, and I stayed as a nanny for an art professor.  And his family and kids.  That was an important time, where I probably was starting to grow up more.  Michael was really, he&#8217;s ten years older than I am.  He was in a different place, and he said &#8220;Well, I want to go back to West Virginia.&#8221;  JW: Had he moved?  PM: No, no.  He didn&#8217;t, I had just left.  JW: And you were married?  PM: No.  We weren&#8217;t married.  I didn&#8217;t get married.  I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry.  It was a matter of eight months.  No, at that point I just left there, but then he--.  I went to school that one semester, and I didn&#8217;t have good boots, and it was really cold, and I left.  [Laughter]  So that was my second college that I just sort of went.  But I worked at an inner-city program with kids in Buffalo, and could tell that was easy, and it worked.  It was really good for me.    And I worked with the families, and the parents, and it was such an easy way to talk to moms and to talk to--.  About the problems in the schools.  To say, &#8220;You can go in and say you don&#8217;t like that, you can say.&#8221; It was easy, it was the natural thing to say, as far as a kid having his way.  &#8220;Well why aren&#8217;t they helping him with that?  Well, yeah you can!&#8221;  I liked doing that.  I was just so flighty, I left that at the end of that.  I can&#8217;t even remember why, Jess.  [Pause]  It was so long ago; it was so long ago.  [Pause]   I don't know, but it was probably Michael.  I linked up with him, we did some traveling together.  He was feeling to go back to East Kentucky and West Virginia, and we really needed to be married.  He was doing community action work and all.  And I just wasn&#8217;t thinking.  I said well, you know.  But then at one point, we were in some sleazy motel, and I said &#8220;I just want to go home.&#8221;  I can remember that, and I went home.  Got on a plane, went home, and my sister Jean met me at the train station, and said &#8220;You will break Mommy and Daddy&#8217;s heart if you come home right now.  They don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. They don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;   And my mother kept saying, &#8220;She&#8217;s in drugs, she&#8217;s into drugs.&#8221; Jean kept saying &#8220;She&#8217;s too political for that, Mom, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s--that&#8217;s the only thing where I really know where she is right now,&#8221; and stuff.  But what I did know is I could always go to Jean&#8217;s apartment.  She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m giving you the key to my apartment,&#8221; but I had been there before, when I&#8217;d left the situation.  But she said &#8220;If in like three or four days, if you really want to come home, then you come home and stay for a while.&#8221; With everybody.  So I said okay, and I did.  My dad got me a job, and I was a waitress then, for about six months or so.  And that was a great thing, working as a wait--.  I had worked as a waitress before, but it was like in this restaurant and they were all--.  They weren&#8217;t kids, it wasn&#8217;t like fast food at that time.  They were all women and this was their job.  I got really close to these women.  I guess that was nice; there was no intellectual thought about this at this point.  I just was living it.  And then Michael came and he said &#8220;Let&#8217;s get married&#8221; and I said &#8220;Okay.&#8221;   And all these waitresses gave me this shower, and all of their--.  I still have all of their recipes, you know, a recipe thing, because it was this restaurant.  And they were most of them divorced, raising kids.  And that&#8217;s why they were working as waitresses, and saying &#8220;Honey, you can take those waitress white shoes off for a while, but you&#8217;ll have &#8216;em back on, I promise.  Whether you stay with that man or not.&#8221;  [Laughter]  And we got married.  And I cannot remember much thought in that decision.  But we did.  We were married; we went to southern Ohio, and there was a lot of coal.  It&#8217;s all in southern Ohio right there.  And worked with the Appalachian Volunteers, but it was out of Ohio University.  Met a lot of good people there, we met lots of good people there.  And I was back to being a volunteer, which I was really happy with.  Went to school part-time, different colleges.  It took me six colleges before I finished.  But it&#8217;s interesting, because I took his name.  Partly going, I just thought it was going to be exhausting in those kinds of situations, every time, to explain why I didn&#8217;t have his name.  Community, anything.  JW: And what year did you get married?  PM: I was nineteen.  [Laughter] I was turning twenty.  So what is that, about [19]70, right in there?  Something like that.  No, it must&#8217;ve been something before that, like 1969, because we were married for at least three years.  We moved from southern Ohio--I guess we were married for four years--and came to Highlander.    He was the music director at Highlander, and I was on the staff for a while.  Mike Clark, he&#8217;s a good buddy of mine.  He was the director at that time.  Guy and Candie, the kids were little at that time.  But it was after they were burned out and were in Knoxville, Riverside--what was her name?  Right over in east Knoxville, right when you get off the bridge and go around and go down.  But they were right here in Knoxville, until they found land.  So it was neat, because it was kind of right here.  That was my first time in Knoxville.  And everything was based right here.    I was with Highlander and with Michael when they bought the property, and looking at different properties.  [I] remember going to see that one for the first time and Frank Adams was working at Highlander at that time.  And Mary Tom was a little girl, got to know Charis Horton pretty well during that time.  It was all [a] good time, during that time.  But I was feeling I didn&#8217;t deserve to be on the Highlander staff, in that way that I didn&#8217;t have enough background.  I feel it was that Michael, and he was, they said--.  And I said &#8220;But you hired Michael, he&#8217;s the music director, and that&#8217;s fine, and that&#8217;s good.&#8221; And it wasn&#8217;t like to stop and hire Polly Murphy, you know?    JW: So what was your job while you were there?  PM: It really wasn&#8217;t so defined.  They had a lot of different workshops going on at that time, and it was right there at the place.  I think they were all getting reestablished.  They didn&#8217;t move.  So I felt like I was working with different workshops, and I was certainly supporting Michael a lot.  And we spent time going out; he did a lot of--.  He does just great oral history and music and getting old-time players, so there was a lot of traveling.  I went with him a lot.  It wasn&#8217;t that long a time; that was not even a year.  I took a job, it was like a free school [at a] Unitarian church was holding it, and it was a preschool, kind of.  And said &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to do this.&#8221;  Again, that was really good, but it was of all my experience, [the] first time it was at the Unitarian church and they were mostly college, you know, UT professors&#8217; kids and all.  It was so different from all my other experiences.  From the point I had left home and every place I had worked, and also it was so different than how I had grown up, in a pretty working-class situation. It was so much theory and discussion and all this stuff.  It wasn&#8217;t bad, again, it was just very different.   I don't know, it was a lot of combination of things.  With Highlander, at that time; probably us at that time.  I don't know if you knew Doug Yarrow and Ruth, it&#8217;s now Baker, in Beckley, West Virginia.  They have done a lot of wonderful stuff.  The four of us moved to West Virginia.  Michael, his family had land in West Virginia.  They, Mike and Doug, had a really good--before videos--like a slideshow with music, and Doug&#8217;s a photographer.  Michael had written a lot of songs on strip mining and all.  It was a strip mining slideshow thing that they went off and did a whole lot of.  Ruth and I stayed there a lot of that time.  Ruth was having a baby, and I also got pregnant during that time.  And that was; I think things were--.  I was also teaching; I got a job at the West Virginia School for the Deaf.  I had not graduated at that point.  Before I left, I learned sign language and took as many classes as I could at UT.  I was working at the nursery school, and I took some classes.  And I got some school under my belt.  I probably had two years, two and a half years.  And I took as much deaf ed, just because that was a school I could get a job at.  That was in this rural county.  At that point, I was getting a lot of good women in my heart at this point, and incredible mentors.  Candie and I have been really close friends for a long time.  She&#8217;s a little older than I am, but at that time it made a much bigger difference, but it made her very helpful for me.  Candie is just so nonjudgmental, and so open, and so warm.  No matter who you are, no matter where you come from, it&#8217;s just not this judging if you are politically correct enough, and doing enough.  It was at this time that I was feeling this all wasn&#8217;t going to work.  Michael was agreeing, too.  And Doug and Ruth went back to Beckley, and although we--.  He was gone a lot, and that was how I was feeling, and I remember we had this talk.  I said, &#8220;I really think it&#8217;s time to go.&#8221; And I took the baby, who was six months old, I took an asparagus plant, and I left.  [Laughter]  In this horrible snowstorm.  And the car, this old VW I had, it never started.  It never started for four years, and it was a really small place, Dylan&#8217;s Run, West Virginia. It was so small.  And this tall Paul hippie guy, he would always say, &#8220;I hate this car.&#8221; Because he said, &#8220;I started this business, and I&#8217;m this hippie, and your car is the first one, and everybody sees you all over the town, leaving the baby on the side and jumpstarting it and running back, getting the baby, and running in, and all this stuff,&#8221; and he said &#8220;I mean, you are so bad for my business.&#8221; And so this happened when I was leaving, right, the whole time and it was a snowstorm.    So I picked up a hitchhiker, and he was helping, going &#8220;Downshift.  Downshift.&#8221;  [Laughter]  And Josh rolled out.  It was before they had car seats and everything.  So he rolled out. He was on the floor.  And he&#8217;s going, &#8220;Your baby&#8217;s okay.  It&#8217;s okay.  He&#8217;s down on the floor, it&#8217;s the best place.  Downshift again.&#8221;  [Laughter]  &#8220;Don&#8217;t use your brakes.  Don&#8217;t use your brakes.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;Stop and I&#8217;ll drive,&#8221; and I said &#8220;No, this car doesn&#8217;t stop!&#8221;   But I did that.  Ultimately, I really feel like that&#8217;s when I became a grownup more.  The very first time was when we smoked marijuana.  I did, for sure.  But I can remember the first, after--.  I didn&#8217;t do anything when I was pregnant, but the first time after the baby.  That&#8217;s going back a little bit.    But we were like an hour out of town, and I had to go to Virginia, to a hospital, and it was over an hour to get there.  I was going to be the first one to have natural childbirth in this hospital.  And we&#8217;re getting it all set up.  And I had the worst delivery.  I ended up having a C-Section, but it all went really bad.  He was blue and it was just--.  But I remember having all that talk, but there really wasn&#8217;t much women&#8217;s support around me that much at that time.  I just thought I was dying.  And our house, we had no water, we had no electricity, we had no anything at that time.  We had ladders to get up and down stuff.  I think all that time, though, there wasn&#8217;t any talk about it. You just did it.    I can remember that doctor just putting his whole entire hand up in, trying--because you know the baby wasn&#8217;t coming in right, it wasn&#8217;t working.  And I just felt like an animal, you know what I mean?  He wasn&#8217;t even talking to me, and he was up into his elbow, and I thought &#8220;This is just amazing.&#8221;  What you can be treated like.  It was such a horrible thing; I remember waking up and this same male doctor--I looked at him and I said &#8220;What happened?&#8221;  The first thing he said is, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be glad I gave you a bikini cut.&#8221;  For the C-Section, you know?  I looked at him, and I was t thinking &#8220;You have no idea.&#8221;  You have no idea.  And I just shut my eyes.  But I remember that part, as far as thinking there&#8217;s got to be other ways to do it.  I wasn&#8217;t aware of it so much.  There was enough talk, like &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m gonna have this natural childbirth,&#8221; but when it didn&#8217;t--.  I didn&#8217;t really know how to do anything about it.    When I had to decide what I was doing as far as smoking, I remember having my first when the baby was three months old.  I took this deep drag of the marijuana, and I felt getting really high, and then I heard the baby cry.  It was this incredible, awful feeling of &#8220;I&#8217;ve gotta get in control, I&#8217;ve gotta get in control.&#8221;  You know?  It was like this feeling of [gagging noise].  But it&#8217;s funny because at that point, I felt like I started really taking control of all that.  Michael was really an alcoholic, and I think he would tell you that.  He is a very strong AA member, and has been, but he had a real serious alcohol problem.  My dad was an alcoholic.  He always feels like: my dad was an alcoholic, he was an alcoholic, and I couldn&#8217;t--.  My dad was a wonderful guy, but he was also an alcoholic, and he says you just couldn&#8217;t do that.  You couldn&#8217;t really put it into words, because I really don&#8217;t know why I left that day.  It was a combination.  I remember when I smoked, I said, &#8220;I have to be in control. You can&#8217;t do this when you have a baby.&#8221;  I went to a whole different plane of my life.  Perspective, and being more of a grownup.    We lived seven miles at the end of this road in West Virginia, before you even got to (41:32).  I think he couldn&#8217;t do much about his alcoholism, and somehow we couldn&#8217;t talk about it enough.  I don&#8217;t think I was grownup enough, too.  But I knew I had to leave.  I ended up saying all that stuff about the marijuana because I think it was really connected, because I realized how scary that was to think about this baby and not being totally connected to your head.  I remember thinking, &#8220;He really isn&#8217;t.&#8221;  But I wasn&#8217;t angry.  I then had to decide, are you going to go home to your parents?  And at that point I decided no.  I just couldn&#8217;t go home.  That wasn&#8217;t home anymore.  I felt like the areas I had lived in was my home.  My folks, it was their home, and I loved them very much, and I loved my sisters.  So I ended up going to Morgantown, West Virginia for a while.  Sally Wooster, you know her? (42:42)  She&#8217;s a great person.  She was going to go to nursing school.  She goes, &#8220;Come on Polly, we&#8217;re just going to do this year and a half thing,&#8221; and had been an Appalachian Volunteer, she had done a lot of that kind of stuff.  I remember thinking, &#8220;That&#8217;s great, I don&#8217;t have a degree, I don&#8217;t have a job, I don&#8217;t have anything.&#8221;  Michael didn&#8217;t have any money.  But I got to Morgantown.  They didn&#8217;t have babies or anything, but I was living in this little downstairs apartment with the baby, and thinking I was going to go to school, and I was thinking, &#8220;How am I going to do this?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this with the baby,&#8221; I can&#8217;t figure out how to do this.  And they were just not there yet.  They weren&#8217;t thinking of any of that.  And I decided to come back.    I had not told my parents that I had left yet, and I came back to Knoxville.  Highlander at this point had moved out to the farm, where they are now.  But I certainly had friends in Knoxville.  I got in the car and drove with the baby and came here.  Then decided I had to get a job; I had to do something, so I got into married student housing, flew back up to West Virginia, got a divorce, just didn&#8217;t deal--.  We didn&#8217;t have child support, I didn&#8217;t do child support, I didn&#8217;t do anything.  He really didn&#8217;t have--.  I mean it&#8217;s funny, because I have seen so many custody things, and the anger.  And neither of us had any money.  Nobody was angry.  He proceeded to remarry and have a whole bunch of kids, and it just didn&#8217;t seem--.  So I came back.  That&#8217;s when I got into married student housing.  Just Josh and I, at UT, so we were over at Sutherland Avenue.  Decided I needed to get a degree.  I didn&#8217;t have any job; I was worried about health insurance.  That was before health insurance for kids, you know?  Ear infection after ear infection.  So I was growing up faster at that point.  [Laughter]  And that was a wonderful time in married student housing.  I still hadn&#8217;t told my parents.  At this point I was divorced.  JW: You hadn&#8217;t told them.  PM: I hadn&#8217;t told them.  JW: Did they know you were--?  PM: No, they didn&#8217;t even know I wasn&#8217;t with Michael.  I mean, I would call home and stuff.  But they didn&#8217;t know.  I think it was because they were going to tell me I needed to come home.  And I knew I couldn&#8217;t do it.  At that time, it wasn&#8217;t like I thought things out so much, I just knew.  Certain things I knew.  I couldn&#8217;t go home; if I told them it would be this real hard thing, so I just wouldn&#8217;t tell them.  I didn&#8217;t tell my sisters at this time either.  No, I did tell my--no, that&#8217;s not true.  They knew I was separated from Michael.  I didn&#8217;t tell them when I actually got the divorce, and I didn&#8217;t tell them when I got here.    But then I had this wonderful time in married student housing.  I was with other women.  I was in a one-bedroom apartment, a real small one with Josh, with other women.  Some with partners, but there were other people, and that&#8217;s back in--he was born in &#8217;72--that were living in one-bedroom apartments who were single moms trying to go to school.  So I had some really close friends, and we went through a whole time of babysitting each others&#8217; kids so we could go to classes.  When classes were coming out, we would all sit down in this real serious way and figure out the classes we could each take, so that we could also take care of each others&#8217; kids.  I was on full scholarship at that point.  So that we could do that.  And that was incredibly bonding, with women.  Incredibly bonding.  They were hard times, and you would stay over this other night for studying with this one, and then giving each other an overnight if there was a guy in the picture.  And it was really depressing because there usually wasn&#8217;t.  And I was still going out to Highlander some.  There was some change of staff, change of people.  Mike Clark was still there, who was a really good friend.  I was going, seeing Guy and Candie. I was going more to see people.  Frank Adams was leaving.  Because my plate was pretty full at that time.  It&#8217;s one of the times I felt the strongest, as a woman.  That was my inner growth.  And it wasn&#8217;t so much with people who were politically doing active stuff. They didn&#8217;t have kids.  I remember I did tell my parents at one point.  I was finally in married student housing, you know, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need your love, I don&#8217;t need your anger, I&#8217;m divorced.&#8221;  My older sister married a lawyer, and I remember my dad saying &#8220;For Christ&#8217;s sake, Polly, we&#8217;ve got two lawyers in the family, and you just got divorced without talking to either of them?&#8221;  I said &#8220;That&#8217;s right, Dad, I want to do it my way so it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s done.&#8221;  I can remember going home at one point, and going down to where we always went swimming in a little park.  A high school friend who was in law school, she said &#8220;Polly, I just can&#8217;t believe this.  You&#8217;re married, divorced, and have this kid.  And I&#8217;m not even out of law school!&#8221;  [Laughter]  I remember looking at her and just saying &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;   But at that time, I was getting to know more people.  Jim [Sessions]--what was the group he was in then?  I don't know, but it was all--Laurel.  Jubilee Center.    JW: Was he doing more campus ministry stuff then?  PM: God, what was he before CORA [Commission on Religion in Appalachia]?  Hey Todd?  [calling out] What was it that, um, Bill Troy and Jim Sessions was doing, you know, when they were at Jubilee?  Before CORA, before any of that?  No, no, way back.  SIM.  [Student Interracial Ministry].  Maybe that was it.  So I was going to music there a lot, and met Bill Troy, met Brenda Bell, met Fran.  Met Lucy.  Everybody was wonderful to me.    JW: So how did you end up going over to that--.  PM: Going to the Jubilee Center?  JW: Yeah.  Like how did you find your way there?  PM: Um.  JW: I guess some of those people were involved at Highlander, so it was--.  PM: Yeah.  And there was a lot of music, and there was a lot of stuff.  But I don't think I really remember meeting everybody one day.  They were up in Jim&#8217;s office, in the SIM office.  I met Bill Troy, and then so I knew a lot of them.  And we started this women&#8217;s music group during that time. I don't know if you heard about that.    JW: Only for the first time today.  Fran briefly mentioned it, but didn&#8217;t really talk about it--.  PM: That was great.  Candie Carawan was in it, everybody was in it.  It was a wonderful music group, we just got together.  We sang a lot of Loretta Lynn.  Josh, at this point, I guess that started and went on, but he remembers some of that.  He remembers being passed around.  He probably would have incredible feelings about this time in his life.  Because he just bounced around.  He just was with me.  Really, he was always here.  He didn&#8217;t go to Michael&#8217;s at all until he was six or seven, something like that.  So I felt things were going better, although I certainly was involved politically at that time with, I don't know.  I can&#8217;t even remember.  But if there was something I can remember going to, I can&#8217;t remember.  [Pause]  Trying to remember what was going on during that time as far as--.  I really wasn&#8217;t a member of a women&#8217;s group per se.  Oh, we did have a women&#8217;s group.  Did they ever mention that we went around to certain houses once a month?  JW: Was it the mothers--?  PM: The mothers&#8217; meetings.  That&#8217;s right.  I told you, I can&#8217;t remember so much of that stuff.  There was so much practical about my life at that time. There was all this stuff.  But yes.  I honestly do remember, as Brenda, a lot of my friends had babies.  They had partners; they spent a lot more time figuring it all out, and I was feeling like I wish I&#8217;d done it a little better.  But Josh was doing okay.  JW: Were you the only single mom in that mothers&#8217; meeting?  PM: Yes.   JW: How was that?  PM: It was okay.  At some point in it, I started dating Todd.  I dated some other people in between there, a little.  I can remember seeing if there--.  At one point, everything seemed to crash.  I said &#8220;Oh my god, I&#8217;ve had this baby, and I came back here, and he has no father, and I&#8217;ve done this horrible thing.&#8221;  I went and saw a free clinic therapist, and did that for a while.  [Pause]  I don't know.  It was just more how I grew up, how my cousins were.  You just kind of did what you had to do, you just trucked along.  Oh, I know, that&#8217;s right.  The therapist, who was saying &#8220;You really should date.  You need to get out and see people.&#8221;  And I was in married student housing and all this stuff.    So I did.  I had some dates.  And I can remember one, and he was uncomfortable because everybody was really young, and he was somebody from UT.  We went, and I was rushing and some kid from married student housing was staying with Josh, and I&#8217;m saying all this stuff.  Josh was screaming, not because of me, he just screamed, you know.  Married student housing used to be back then, there used to be an outdoor movie theater, right?  Like by Kay&#8217;s ice cream, right there.  We used to go under the fence and get the things and watch the movies all the time.  It was like, right by my apartment.  But we drove around and went in it, and sat down, and I said, &#8220;So what is this?&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the first movie.  It&#8217;s on first.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t what we came to see.  I just left a screaming kid, I just left all this stuff, and we&#8217;re looking at this stupid movie?&#8221;  And it was like this first date.  I said, &#8220;Listen.  You go ahead and watch this movie.  I don&#8217;t want to watch this movie.  But I know a way back to my apartment and I&#8217;m going to go take care of these things and I&#8217;ll be back in time for the second movie.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;What?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;I gotta go.&#8221; And I just left.  Went back and did all this stuff, and came back and he was gone.  [Laughter]  Which didn&#8217;t bother me in the least.  I just went with the babysitter, kid, and myself, and we went back under the fence and we watched the movie.  [Laughter]  It was fun.  I remember one other time, walking up the hill to get a piece of material; it was a time when everybody wore this stretch elastic that zipped down the back.  This was my second date that didn&#8217;t work.  And I put it on.  I made it, I bought this piece of material.  I didn&#8217;t have a sewing machine, and I sewed it by hand, up the back.  So I had this dress.  And he was uncomfortable too, in a way, that I had this kid.  But I told him, &#8220;I have this.&#8221;  And I picked him up and I said &#8220;This is Josh.&#8221;  And Josh pulled it straight down.  [Laughter]  To my waist.  Date two.  I remember, when I&#8217;d go see this counselor, and I said &#8220;So that was the second date.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to stop this for a while.&#8221;  It was hard.  It was hard because you had to keep on trucking to get everything done.  Dated some other people a little bit along the way.  Bill Troy, who I didn&#8217;t know at that point, and all; Todd was his roommate.  And we started dating.  I also finished school at that time.  And then the mothers&#8217; meetings were going on.  And we had the singing group. It seems like that was going on, and I just can&#8217;t remember, I hate to say it, but politically, you know--.    And as far as Vietnam, we never talked about Vietnam.  Which was a big deal.  Way back in high school.  That was a big deal because my sister was very involved, and my dad was a World War Two veteran.  We were talking to him a lot about it, and the civil rights things with my sister.  He was pacing back and forth, saying &#8220;They oughta be home, they&#8217;re going to be shot,&#8221; you know. And I&#8217;m thinking my sister&#8217;s going to be on TV.  I can remember talking a whole lot about the Vietnam War with him.  Because I was home, but then my sisters did.  And I went to the marches in Washington, and I can remember going with some--.  JW: Antiwar marches, or civil--.  PM: Antiwar.  Yeah, the antiwar marches for Vietnam, more.  I remember I was with some friends, and we drove from wherever I was at that point in my life.  Bending down to fix my sandal, I looked up and there was my sister.  That was a huge, the huge, huge one, like a hundred thousand people, and I looked up and said &#8220;Hi Jeanie!&#8221;  You know, that was my sister!  JW: You didn&#8217;t know she was going to be there?  PM: No.  And Jean goes, &#8220;How can we just run into each other here?&#8221;  I had a boyfriend a lot through high school who was a good guy, and he went to a New York State college--I&#8217;m going way, flipping back--but I can remember the war was really important to me.  At that age, at that time.  I had been to a few demonstrations and some local demonstrations.  When I was working in Mingo County, and it was the Detroit riots, civil rights riots, and that community [was] just terrified.  And I was, had been there, I had no other, I was not hearing anything except from them.  That every black person was coming to West Virginia in Mingo County, to kill them all.  I mean, they were terrified.    But that was [an] important time, because it was just very real.  Talking about that with people.  And it was good.  It was good for all of us.  And there was a lot of talking that happened.  Vietnam, I think I was maybe at home when I was working as a waitress.  And talking to all those waitresses.  Before, maybe after, during Morehead, I remember going to see this boyfriend.  I think he always thought we were going to get married. You know, we talked about it in high school.  He was a good guy.  But I just looked at him and I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s this war going on.  This is so important to be heard. It&#8217;s got to stop.&#8221;  I can remember us just looking at each other, in this divide, of him--he was a member of the fraternity, and just--I kept talking about what was going on in the world, and saying &#8220;Bill, we&#8217;ve got to, this is much more important than school right now.&#8221;  He was freaking out, I was out of school, and I was saying &#8220;This is so important.&#8221; And I can remember looking at each other for a long time, and I said &#8220;I think I gotta go.&#8221;  He just couldn&#8217;t believe it.  I just got a bus.  I went and got on a bus from New Paltz, New York, and went to my sister&#8217;s in New York City one more time [Laughter] and that was the end of that.    I just said &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this.  And I can&#8217;t understand how you can.&#8221;  And I remember all that.  And I felt that.  And it was a good time, because again, I wasn&#8217;t with a lot of people who were politically active.  I was working in a restaurant.  But I remember having a lot of talks, and going to marches in Washington.  And hitchhiking.  The only thing I don&#8217;t tell my kids.  Because that really was bad.  My sisters tell stories on me because I think I just did more.  I don't know if I didn&#8217;t think, but I took dares and did more stuff than my sisters did.  They&#8217;d always roll their eyes and say &#8220;Polly,&#8221; but I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Just don&#8217;t tell them I hitchhiked, just don&#8217;t tell them I hitchhiked.  It was mostly going to demonstrations, though; I would just hitchhike and go up.  When I wasn&#8217;t going with people, if I just was going by myself.  JW: Which was pretty amazing.  PM: Yeah.  It was; I can remember standing on an overpass with a sign, said &#8220;Going to Washington.&#8221;  And I had this hat from Ireland that my grandma gave me, Grammy, and a truck went by and blew it off.  And I went [mumbles] &#8220;Oh my gosh! Grammy I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;  [Laughter]  It was kind of a connection of different times in your life.  JW: Your older sister, it sounds like she provided you a political education.  PM: She did.  She provided me with a lot of education.  And she always provided me with room to grow.  She took me someplace in New York City and got me a diaphragm.  She did.  It was the same diaphragm.  That&#8217;s the only birth control I had, I still had, when I got pregnant with Josh.  And I used the diaphragm!  [Laughter] Time to change that.  I had done nothing else about birth control since the one my sister had gotten me, saying &#8220;You might need this.  In time, and let&#8217;s just have it with you.&#8221;  Which my parents never would have done at all.  I remember  right after I got pregnant, thinking &#8220;I need a new one.&#8221;   Then I was a grownup.  And I feel like I was more involved.  I started teaching and I do think I was at Highlander at educational stuff, and Candy, they had different workshops, and there was other, music stuff.  I think then, as far as being a woman, and feeling strong, and sharing that with other women.  I worked at a residential school, and it was primarily very poor families.  I&#8217;ve always worked with poor families, because if they had more money, they kept their kids out of going to a residential school most of the time.  It was seventy-five percent really poor.  Didn&#8217;t care.  I was comfortable with those families, I was comfortable with those kids. And I think I ended up with them a lot.  I can remember the first year.  How I found this house is I felt fairly alienated, because they always saw me as this hippie.  I remember one teacher, because it&#8217;s a very conservative school.  JW: Are you talking about--  PM: The Tennessee School for the Deaf, yeah.  I remember the first year, one of the teachers, years later, told me, &#8220;I always remember when I saw you got a job and you came, that we were in a sign language class together.  And you had to tell a story in sign language, and nobody could catch your story.  And it was this guy that came on a boat and got to an island and had a revolution.&#8221;  And it was Castro.  I was telling the story, thinking of Castro.  Of course I said, &#8220;I did that?&#8221;  She said "Yes, we were all freaked out, Polly.&#8221;  [Laughter]  But I felt alienated; I felt like I was really different from all these teachers.  And I was a single parent, and I had this kid.    So I hung out with this eccentric retired teacher who substituted.  Her name was Mrs. Carr and she seemed so old to me.  She probably was eighty, but she seemed like she was a hundred.  And I remember one day I was hanging out after school, and I said &#8220;I need to move.&#8221;  And she said &#8220;Oh, I think I&#8217;m going to go back over to North Carolina with my husband.&#8221;  He was deaf, and she was totally oral; she didn&#8217;t use sign language at all.  And she said, &#8220;Come on home.&#8221;    And it was the house up here, which has now been made three times bigger.  The house right up there.  It was like eight acres, plus the house, and that house had air conditioning, heating, and all that stuff.  And water.  It was $26,000, plus (1:09:32), and I said "Mrs. Carr, I don&#8217;t have $26,000.&#8221;  She goes &#8220;Polly, out the back door.&#8221;  And she pointed to this tiny little house.  So we got this.  With like an acre and a half, for $8,000.  So I moved here, and then I remember telling Fran and Jim about it.  That was during that first year.    The first part was things like they said I was Ms. Murphy.  I also, that was the other thing that I did, his name was Michael Kline, I had taken Kline. And I was at this point just twenty-four.  And I said &#8220;I want my name back.&#8221;  I feel like Mrs. Kline is your mom, nobody&#8217;s ever called me Mrs. Kline.  And the judge, I mean the courts here, wouldn&#8217;t let me take my name back without a psychologist that said it was psychologically safe and healthy for Josh for me to take my name back.  I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  So I got that psychologist, I got that free clinic person to come in.  And I got my name back.  Michael had to sign, give them permission, that I could do this.  At the time, I said, &#8220;I want Josh to have Murphy in his name,&#8221; and he said that's fine.  I wanted to hyphenate Josh&#8217;s name, Murphy-Klein.  And the judge--.  And it was also, you know Joan Boyd?  You ever heard her name?  JW: I know her name.  PM: She wrote this wonderful song about Josh, because his name was Joshua--Breathitt County is where I met Michael--so it was &#8220;Joshua Breathitt Murphy-Klein is a friend of mine,&#8221; but wrote up this whole long story, song about him.  I had to do all of this stuff to get my name back.  Then I said, &#8220;Joshua Breathitt Murphy-Klein is an awful long name for a kid that&#8217;s not even a year old. Can I drop the Breathitt and just have Joshua Murphy Klein?&#8221;  And the judge said &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do any of this, and it&#8217;s another fifty dollars.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a nice name, Joshua Breathitt Murphy-Klein!&#8221;  It was fifty dollars for every name change, which was a big deal for me at this time.  [1:12:00]  I can remember that, in front of the judge, juggling what to change.  I said, &#8220;So it&#8217;s fifty dollars, so it&#8217;s fifty dollars.&#8221;  So his name was hyphenated.  My name was back to Polly Murphy, but then I said, &#8220;I want Ms., when I went to school, work, because I wasn&#8217;t a Miss and I wasn&#8217;t a Mrs.  And they wouldn&#8217;t let me do it.  It had to be Miss or Mrs.  JW: The school wouldn&#8217;t let you do it.  PM: Yeah.  And so I wrote this long letter.  And that was the start of my, when I retired, some of the teachers who were all--. I think of it as back when I was with the waitresses, they were all East Tennessee women.  Conservative, Baptist, you know all different, nuns.  We got up, and all my friends, we did all these different things, and I was just going to the same place every day.  And always feeling like he&#8217;s doing all this stuff.  And at this point, I had also gotten married; I had Kate; I had the insurance.  And I think there&#8217;s really a lot to be said about that.  I got very close with a lot of these women; we went through having all of our babies, you know, and all this stuff, but it was always me.  And I was kind of good in that, like when I retired.  The two teachers, who you know are not at all political--very conservative, very religious--and gave me a party and were very close.  And we were talking, and they gave me an incredible wonderful party outside, everything was just how I like it.  And said, &#8220;What we remember about Polly mostly is all those letters.  All those letters to the administration, again and again and again and again.  And I thought, that&#8217;s a good way to be remembered.  As far as being lonesome, where everybody saw you as this hippie girl in some ways, but other ways not.  But I was younger in those ways.  The first year, the first letter, was why I couldn&#8217;t be Mrs., why I couldn&#8217;t be Ms.  And I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a baby and all those kids are deaf and they don&#8217;t really understand.  They do understand Ms., but Miss means not married.  Mrs. means husband.&#8221;  But I said, &#8220;And I&#8217;m holding this baby and he comes to everything I come to here.  And it's a good time for them to learn Ms.&#8221;!  And there were a lot of teachers that would just call me Ms., &#8220;Hey Ms.!&#8221; because that was back in &#8217;72.  And I got bunches of friends that are gone now, they&#8217;d just call me Ms.  &#8220;Hey Ms, what are you doing on the--&#8221;  But the other thing, the supervisor there, we had a love/hate relationship, and it got harder and harder.  She was a southern queen in lots of ways, and thought she was so cool because she had been to New York City and she had done this stuff.  But she was very harsh on poor people.  She was very condescending, and really awful.  And I didn&#8217;t shave my legs, and I didn&#8217;t shave under my arms.  I wore these jeans she hated, and it drove her crazy.  But I went to two meetings with her with families, and she made these uneducated, poor families so uncomfortable.  I waited until after school that day, and I said, &#8220;If we&#8217;re both going to stay here, we have got to get this worked out.  I cannot handle--you know, how here they are, they live in Memphis, they&#8217;re coming all the way over here, they&#8217;re poor black.  Leaving their kid, and you make them feel like shit?&#8221;  And she&#8217;s just sitting there, and finally I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what.  I will shave my legs, and I will keep them shaved.  I will shave them here.  And keep them shaved.  And shave under my arms.  And I will never wear those jeans again.  If you never treat a family like that.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;And that&#8217;s a big deal for you, you have to look at me every day.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Or I&#8217;ll put &#8216;em right in your face.&#8221;  [Laughter]  And she said &#8220;Will you shave them now, right here?&#8221; and so I did.  I shaved them in her office.  And she got better.  She was still her, but she really got better.  JW: What a great story.  PM: It became, and I made sure everybody knew the story, so it was a fun way to work on it.  And I said, &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s treated with respect.  Everybody knows just as much as she does.  And in every meeting, you all have to--you&#8217;re the hall monitors on this, or those hairs grow.&#8221;  [Laughter]  JW: So you were doing political work, in the space of the school.  That&#8217;s a pretty big deal to get someone to be nicer to poor people.    PM: Yeah.  And I did.  I did that a lot.  It&#8217;s interesting because all that happened, but that didn&#8217;t stop, and she had other problems, and ultimately she resigned.  Because of the--.  This friend of mine, she took a year off, because she had her third unplanned kid.  She says this always happened, because she says, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t there to mediate between the two of you.&#8221;  But it was a little black boy from Memphis, and she was awful.  She was just awful.  He was young, and he was deaf, and he had so many strikes against him.  He was put in my class, and I finally couldn&#8217;t.  Somebody was walking out and I said, &#8220;I want you to stay in, I want a witness.&#8221;  We need to have a meeting with all of us at a table.  But we need to have,&#8221; I was naming all of these other administrators; I said, &#8220;This can&#8217;t go on.&#8221;  And she resigned.  It was a hard reality, because I always thought--.  And she has died, and we never worked it out.  That was one of those things in life where you figure out you can&#8217;t resolve everything, and you can&#8217;t work it out.  She would never forgive me because it was the end of her career.  But I had no apologies, I mean that had to stop.  For that kid.  So I do think, yes, I do think I spent a lot of time.  And I ran into the administration a lot.  And I didn&#8217;t realize how exhausted I was from that until I retired.  That&#8217;s a hard job.  The thing that was good with that is that was thirty years of working with a lot of the same people.  And we got to really love and respect each other, even though nobody became political activists.    And I stayed who I was, but I got a lot of support from that staff.  The other part is deaf people are not empowered.  It wasn&#8217;t until &#8217;78, &#8217;83, when was the strike with all the deaf, the college resistance, you know.  What there was, just needing a lot of empowerment.  And most of the parents were not deaf.  Only ten percent of kids come from deaf parents.  Ninety percent have hearing parents.  Most of them are poor, and it just how education, and they live there.  So I was constantly having a hand slap for being involved with the families too much.  But I felt like it worked really well, and as far as support from the rest of the staff.  And then any time at that point, as far as being against, following wars and stuff, people would say &#8220;Ah, I saw you marching, Polly!  I saw you in front of the courthouse!  Something with immigrants!&#8221;  I think it was a good thing to stay in one place in that way.  I&#8217;m proud of that.  I think my heart, I taught--loved--those kids, but my heart was a lot with the families, parents, and when I retired and I&#8217;m working with early intervention now, I&#8217;m a home visitor, and these families whose parents are younger than my kids.  A lot of them, as far as the deaf.  I taught all of the kids. Now I&#8217;m working with their kids.  While I was teaching, I was teaching kids of kids.  They grew up and had kids and I was still teaching.  I can remember I had a really tough kid after school one day, and it&#8217;s residential, so they just have to run up the hill.  I&#8217;d to call the cottage and say &#8220;(1:22:46) is coming up.&#8221;  But he started doing this, and he was a tough kid, and he looked at me and he said, &#8220;My daddy, he wants to know, do you still have that tree house and the chickens?&#8221;  JW: [Laughter]  PM: And I said, &#8220;And who was your daddy?&#8221; you know, a kid I had taught.  And now I&#8217;m working with their kids&#8217; kids, right?  Because they have all--.  [Pause]  Yeah.  Some, it is.    JW: You&#8217;re getting into third generation.  PM: Yeah.  I mean that&#8217;s with the deaf kids, but I don&#8217;t just have deaf kids.  But it&#8217;s like the true, I mean it&#8217;s poor families, rural families, with kids with problems, and just the awesome strength they have and I love being part of (1:23:53) moms.  It&#8217;s the moms who say, "So, I&#8217;m twenty-one and I just had my third kid diagnosed with auditory neuropathy.  So what do I do now?&#8221;  But not falling apart.  You know, &#8220;I&#8217;m twenty-one and this is my first baby and he&#8217;s blind.  Never occurred to me that that was going to happen.&#8221;  But just watching, and saying, &#8220;You are your baby&#8217;s best advocate.  Your family&#8217;s best advocate,&#8221; and parents who just watching them stand up and supporting them with that.  It&#8217;s awesome, it really is awesome.    As far as feminist values, I feel like it gets to the core.  And it&#8217;s not me at all saying, &#8220;Let me tell you how to do this.&#8221;  I see them once a week, and we collaborate a lot, and I have gotten very close to most of these families.  I see them a whole lot.  I still see all the kids.  Supporting their strength as being young women, and just being right foot left foot, right foot left foot.  And they do it. It&#8217;s like a pure sense, it was much harder at TSD, because it was like fighting with that administration the whole time.  And I was pegged with the administration, they didn&#8217;t like me very--they just were tired of me from the get-go.  And we would always be--.  In supporting families, and now I don&#8217;t have that administration in the way.  I&#8217;m just going to the homes, you know?  Saying &#8220;Go for it, go for it,&#8221; and seeing all their strength.    What I left out of this huge picture is a wonderful partner that I married back I guess in [19]76, &#8217;77.  We had another little girl; she is now thirty-two; Josh is now thirty-eight.  I don't know if they&#8217;re--it&#8217;s interesting, because neither of them are--they&#8217;re certainly politically supportive of everything; they&#8217;re not so politically active.  Josh is, I don't know, he&#8217;s--.  But they&#8217;re both doing well.  Kate is right now a special ed teacher, deciding she doesn&#8217;t want to be.  She&#8217;s done a lot of things and she&#8217;s finishing and she said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this.&#8221;  And I think she can&#8217;t; I think she&#8217;s going to go on and do something else.  She&#8217;s been working with emotionally disturbed kids and all.    I had a rough marriage at the beginning, and I think there was a lot of defensiveness.  I&#8217;m at such a good place in my life. I feel like I have been in so many good situations to work with women older than me, when I was younger, trying to figure it all out.  Alongside them, and now I&#8217;m old, and working with young women with big struggles.  I&#8217;m working with the kids, obviously, these babies who are deaf or blind, but interestingly enough, I feel like I do a lot with these kids and saying, &#8220;Okay, this works, let&#8217;s try this and this.&#8221;  But I feel like the hardcore bond is with me and these moms.  It is.  I end up really close, and we stay close.  And I&#8217;m still doing it, and I just love it.  JW: Well thank you for sharing.  PM: Is there any--I jumped around so much, is that--.  JW: It works really well that way.  [Laughter]  That&#8217;s how we like it.  Is there anything else you want to add?  PM: [Pause]  No, I guess just as far as dreams.  With my partner Todd, at some point we would really like to--.  We don&#8217;t have the money, or the ways and means of many of our friends to travel all over and do all these things, and we&#8217;ve got our chickens and our dogs and this house.  But I am slowly listening to Spanish tapes, and I have some Hispanic families, and I&#8217;m saying I&#8217;m going to learn Spanish.  My dream is to do some project, get a part of some project, the two of us for a couple of years.  Someplace in this hemisphere.  In Latin America or Central America and see where I can be helpful.  And I just hope that comes true, comes to pass.  That&#8217;s a dream I have.  So now I&#8217;m doing fine.  Ironically, all that stuff with my mom, my sisters are both up North, and my mom ended up right here with me.  [Laughter].  I can remember when everybody, when she was young and I ended up here, and we had goats and we had chickens and everything, she looked at both of my sisters and she said, &#8220;When I get old, just don&#8217;t leave me down there with Polly and those goats."  [Laughter]  And here she is.  JW: That&#8217;s so funny.
