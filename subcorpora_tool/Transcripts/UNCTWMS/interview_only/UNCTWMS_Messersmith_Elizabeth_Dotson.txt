ELIZABETH JONES: This is Elizabeth Jones at the Moxie Project at UNC. It&#8217;s July 28th, 2014, and I&#8217;m speaking with Beth Messersmith of Moms Rising at her home in Durham, North Carolina. Thank you so much for doing this interview.  BETH MESSERSMITH:  I am really touched that you would ask me.   EJ:  So to start off with, I want to know a little bit about where and when you were born and what it was like where you grew up.  BM:  I was born in April 1977 in a little town called Kingsport, Tennessee up in the mountains where Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina come together. It&#8217;s a really gorgeous place. My whole family is from there for generations. Only me and my brother have left so far. Everyone&#8217;s there which makes me miss them all. But it&#8217;s a very small place. The primary employer is Eastman Chemical. And all my family worked for Eastman Chemical. It&#8217;s also a really white place and very conservative place. If you wanted to get involved in politics, it wasn&#8217;t so much whether you were a Democrat or Republican but which Republican you were going to support. I think a lot of people have very similar life experiences there. And so I didn&#8217;t have the kind of opportunities to know folks from different backgrounds that my kids have growing up here in Durham.  EJ:  Were you parents conservative or your family?   BM:  That&#8217;s a good question. My family, my extended family has always been pretty conservative. And my parents were lifelong Republicans until interestingly Newt Gingrich took the school lunch program away back in the early [19]90s. I think they gave money even. But at that point they were like, &#8220;you know I can&#8217;t be part of this.&#8221; And they stopped being registered Republicans. I think my dad became an Independent.  My mom, I think they may both be Independents. It became less about party and more about issues.   EJ:  That&#8217;s interesting. Do you have brothers and sisters?  BM:  I do. I have a little brother who&#8217;s in his thirties so not that little. But yeah, he lives down in, near Chattanooga. So&#8212;  EJ:  How did y&#8217;all develop your political, your politics growing up? Was there a specific political event that shaped your beliefs or--?  BM:  Probably the biggest determining factor for mine--and I can&#8217;t really speak for my brother but he and I share political beliefs. I think it&#8217;s that while my parents may have been on paper conservative Republicans, in terms of the way they always raised us it was very much about seeing different experiences, caring for one another. They were very active in the church. They were very active in the community trying to make sure folks&#8217; needs were met. And my dad had a job where he traveled about half the year internationally. So he was always coming home with stories from other places in the world and pictures and experiences. And when his colleagues would come here they would come to our house for dinner. So we got to have lots of conversations and experiences that other folks I grew up with may not have had. And those shaped our world view and made us both have a travel bug and this itch to get out and see what more of the world there was. For me personally I grew up during--, my political consciousness was around the time of the first Gulf War and also when Nelson Mandela was being freed and the Rwandan genocide was happening. So it was a lot of international issues. Not as much domestic issues but really seeing that I felt like there was a place in the world for kindness and that policy determined so much of what happens in responding to those crises.  EJ:  Earlier you were talking about that itch to explore out. Where did that itch take place?  BM:  Well, let&#8217;s see. First it took me to Memphis.   EJ:  Okay.  BM:  So I got a chance during high school, Tennessee had Governor&#8217;s Schools for different issues, and we had one that was the Governors School for international studies. And you got to go and spend a summer on the University of Memphis studying. You got one of six choices. You could study Arabic. You could study Chinese, Russian. I wanted to study Swahili.  EJ:  Really.  BM:  And so I had a native Swahili professor who was teaching us and a Liberian professor who was explaining African politics and intersections with American foreign policy. And it was just mind expanding, mind bending coming from where I came from. Memphis has such [history], I mean with Dr. King being killed there. My father was in the National Guard when he [Dr. King] was murdered and went down and was one of the National Guardsmen trying to keep the peace in Memphis, and it was going to the Civil Rights museum, getting to know the BB King, Beale Street cultural side. I mean it was mind blowing for me. And I came back going into my senior year in high school and had decided I wanted to study, I knew I had always known I wanted to do political science. But I knew that I wanted to do comparative and international studies and focus particularly on Africa. And so that&#8217;s, that was what I did for undergrad. I went to Furman University and focused there on international politics.  EJ:  And did you ever go aboard?  BM:  I did. When I was at Furman, I went and spent a semester in East Africa and Israel, and it was amazing and wonderful, but it made me realize a month of Swahili was not nearly enough. And it was most frustrating to me because the people I most wanted to speak to were the women. The further I got out of the city was the only way I could talk to most of the women was through their children. And I knew that I really wanted to be able to speak directly. And so I decided I wanted to go to grad school in a place that I could focus on Swahili and I could do nonprofit management and that sort of thing. So I finished up at Furman and went to Indiana with the plan, the plan, being that I was going to get my degree there and go and do, either work in D.C. on international foreign policy or actually go back primarily to East Africa and work on international development work. But again that was the plan.  EJ:  Well, how did those plans change?  BM : Well, when I was a freshman in college, I met the guy who would become my husband, when we graduated, he said, &#8220;Wherever you want to go is where I will go.&#8221; So we moved to Indiana for me to go to grad school and he worked crazy hours at a minimum wage job at the hospital and took classes at night. And when we finished, it was his turn to go to grad school. So we moved down here to Duke for him to go to school at Duke, and the plan was when he finished, then we would go wherever I chose because he&#8217;s a physician assistant, and he could do that pretty much anywhere. And he was willing to go anywhere I said. But while we were here I found work here that I loved and had some eye opening experiences that made me realize that there&#8217;s, when you&#8217;re talking about democracy and when you&#8217;re talking about building a civil society and when you&#8217;re talking about long standing inequality, that a lot of the places you need to start are home first. And so when he graduated and said, &#8220;Okay where are we going?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, I think we&#8217;re staying here,&#8221; which&#8212;  EJ:  How did he feel about that?  BM:  I think it was the right choice because the work that I can do here is authentic, and there&#8217;s a huge need for it, and I have some, the more I sat with it. I have challenges with the work done by the international aid community and the prejudices and biases that we carry with us in that work as opposed to--. Now I really admire the NGOs that are doing work that builds capacity of local people and provides local leadership. But I think that a lot of the work doesn&#8217;t do that. And I&#8217;m a big believer that true organizing and true strength building has to start with meeting people where they&#8217;re at and giving them ownership. I personally think that in a lot of cases it&#8217;s a better use of international funding to go to local people who know their own communities and have those relationships than it is to bring in foreigners to do that work.  EJ:  How did you get interested in this nonprofit organization work?  BM:  I always knew that I had to do work that would feed my soul. I was fortunate to grow up where and my family was comfortable. We were economically secure. But I never had money as a driving factor. I really wanted something that would bring me contentment and that I would feel at the end of the day like I had served whatever purpose I was here for. And I knew that couldn&#8217;t be something that I clocked in and out of. It had to be like an extension of my values. And yeah, so I have friends--. The other path that I looked at was the Foreign Service and working at the State Department. One of the women I would describe as one of my best friends [who is] actually in the Congo right now doing a lot of the same work that I always thought I would be doing. And I admire her, but when we get together we talk about how we&#8217;re living these kinds of dual sides of a life, and the things that I always wonder about she&#8217;s living. And the things she misses&#8212;the being able to be close to her family and raise her children near her parents and all that she doesn&#8217;t experience necessarily. I think that it&#8217;s the same thing we both wanted work that would feed our souls.  EJ:  Now you have children.  BM:  I do.  EJ:  And how many children do you have?  BM:  I have two. I have a nine year old boy and a six year old girl.   EJ:  Okay. Did you always want children?  BM:  I've always wanted children.  EJ:  Why?  BM:  I had the most amazing parents. And where I grew up family was where it all started. Like you have each other&#8217;s backs. You&#8217;re there for each other. And I felt like mom always said that if she didn&#8217;t do anything else in the world but raise children that would make a contribution, that that was enough. She would&#8217;ve done, she would&#8217;ve replaced herself with someone who she felt like would bring good to the world. And she had this huge thing plastered on her fridge that said, &#8220;Motherhood is the toughest job you&#8217;ll ever love.&#8221; And I think it&#8217;s true, and I have so much, I feel like we give motherhood and family values a lot of lip service. We don&#8217;t value, in the policies that we pass, we don&#8217;t actually act on those values. But I believe that our society is built on relationships that begin at home. And I wanted to be part of that.   EJ:  I definitely get that, those values for sure. But with your parents, what roles did they take in caring for you and your brother when you were growing up?  BM:  Good question.  Like many folks in my generation it was a different time. And when my mom, my parents, they actually said that they wouldn&#8217;t have had me when they had me if the doctor hadn&#8217;t said you have to get on with it because my parents were in their thirties when I was born. My mom had had a fifteen year career. She was an executive assistant at Eastman Chemical. And my dad had worked his way up through Eastman Chemical as well. And they were living their lives, and they were having adventures. They were having a really enjoyable time. And unlike a lot of women of her generation, my mom didn&#8217;t rush from marriage to motherhood. But she really had time to explore who she was. And so many times I would love to go back and meet who she was before she was my mom because from all the pictures--. She is and she was a pretty phenomenal woman and not just a woman of her time.   But when she was in her thirties the doctor said you&#8217;ve got to get on with it if you&#8217;re going to have kids. And when she had me, she left her career and she never went back. And so she was the primary person in charge of the day to day taking care of me and my brother. She was PTA president from like forever for every PTA that I think I was ever a part of. And she mobilized huge groups of people to do all sorts of things. She cared for my grandparents and her in-laws. She, when I stopped working for a while to take care of my kids, she said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t feel like you have fill every spare moment with volunteering to be worthy.&#8221; Like being a mother is worthy enough. And that she regretted that she had spent so much time in the community. I mean she was a Sunday school teacher. She delivered Meals on Wheels. She ran the PTA. She, she did everything while she mothered us. But having her home and having her as a touchstone in my life was always really, really important.   My dad, I mean he always says, &#8220;The credit goes to your mom. The credit goes to your mom.&#8221; But my dad was also not a man of his time in that he, to this day, he&#8217;s in there. He&#8217;s cleaning the dishes. He&#8217;s doing the laundry. He was never really limited by gender roles either, which had a big impact on me. I think it also had a huge impact on my brother. But my dad worked incredibly hard and incredibly long hours. He was at work by six every morning even though he didn&#8217;t have to be there until eight. He worked his way up, and he finished college when I was thirteen by going to school at night. He was traveling, started traveling all over the world when I was nine, and he was gone a lot. And that was really hard. I had lots of childhood memories of meeting him at the airport and changing out his suitcases as he switched from South America to Asia. But they both always really encouraged us to follow our dreams.   EJ:  And did you do the same with your children? What are your responsibilities with your husband and raising your children?  BM:  It&#8217;s hard. I mean we try to divide it up as equally as possible. But the reality is that I have a job that, Moms Rising recognizes the importance of flexible work. And so I can be there and I can do the doctor visits and I can take, go volunteer at their schools when I want to and that sort of thing. He, like my dad, has a job where he&#8217;s at work by six a.m. every morning and works until six p.m. every night. As much as he would like to be, he&#8217;s not able to be here as much. When I first started staying home, it was really hard for me to adjust to, like I don&#8217;t want a 1950s marriage. The reality of some of it is that it depends on who&#8217;s available when.   I look at my brother and his wife and they wanted to be able to truly co-parent, and they both left jobs with big firms to start their own photography studio and design studio so they could truly split childcare, split house care, split work. And it&#8217;s cool getting to see all the ways my brother&#8217;s engaged in his kids&#8217; lives that a lot of men simply still aren&#8217;t able to be even if they want to be, which speaks to the fact that we need policies that recognize that the roles of fathers in our children&#8217;s lives is just as important because I still don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve caught up as a society.   EJ:  How has motherhood shaped your activism?  BM:  Motherhood has completely changed my activism. I've always been an activist. I mean I think always been an activist.  EJ:  Yeah. Even when you were little.  BM:  Yeah, sort of. Yeah. I was forever getting into arguments with my grandparents about things.  EJ:  Oh goodness.  BM:  And one of my biggest, actually one of my biggest regrets is that my freshman year in college my grandmother had sent me a Halloween card that said &#8220;Vote for America, vote for X person.&#8221; And I was specifically instructed by my parents not to call her back and say anything about it because her heart was feeling very timid and her doctor said she didn&#8217;t need to be upset. But it&#8217;s always been about speaking up for what I saw as the truth. And that that has evolved over time. I mean this shift from international activism, to more I North Carolina local state activism. Before I was a mom I was first an organizer and then the co-executive director [of] Democracy North Carolina.  EJ:  Oh what did you do there?  BM:  So for the first couple of years I was a field organizer working on voting rights and campaign finance reform work. We were working on public financing options for state elections, and we were also working on same day registrations and expanding voting hours, and so I did that for a number of years. And then when I started there we were with Democracy South, which was a regional organization. And after I had been there a few years, we spun off into Democracy North Carolina. And at [age] twenty-five or twenty-six was given the amazing opportunity to be the co-executive director there. And so I did a lot of the transition work and the how you set up a nonprofit, how you build a board, how you keep funding, all those sorts of things. But then I was working, I loved my job. I loved being an ED, and I worked crazy hours because this work requires that you meet people when they are available, and that&#8217;s often only the evenings and weekends. And so I regularly worked sixty plus hours a week.   When I finally had kids and called the neighborhood and said, &#8220;I need a card to be able to get into the pool.&#8221; They&#8217;re like, &#8220;How have you lived here all these years and you&#8217;ve never been to the pool?&#8221; I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m like I've been busy. I've been busy. Yeah. So I knew I wanted to slow my hours back and I was, my hope had been to go back as a part-time organizer being in the field again. But that wasn&#8217;t exactly what happened .I ended up having my son nine weeks early, completely unexpectedly. I woke up one morning with blood pressure through the roof and well within stroke range, and I went to the hospital to get it checked and was admitted and stayed in the hospital. I was almost twenty-eight weeks pregnant at the time and stayed in the hospital for several weeks and then finally they had to do an emergency C-section to take my son, and he was two pounds fourteen ounces and he was teeny tiny. So that meant of course that I left that job really early, and they were amazing in terms of letting me make up the time because I was counting on that pay like so many moms. They were amazing about letting me use vacation and sick and comp and all that to get through that.   But so I started this adventure with him of being in the NICU, and most days I was the only person--. My mom and dad drove over. One of them would come and sit with me next to his bed because my husband couldn&#8217;t get off work. And I would sit all day next to his little bed because all the research says that hearing your voice and feeling your hand has tremendous difference in their outcomes, and there were several points where we almost lost him and I wasn&#8217;t not going to be there. But for all these other parents who equally wanted to be there, they didn&#8217;t have any paid maternity leave or if they did have any maternity leave paid or unpaid, they needed to save it for when their baby came home because children like that you can&#8217;t put into childcare. They have too many needs. So I had a lot of time to sit.  EJ:  What was going through your mind at that time?  BM:  Panic, sheer panic. Wondering if my baby was going to make it, guilt that I couldn&#8217;t do the one job that I had which was hold him in and keep him safe, stress not from anyone external but internal stress that I had left a job without transitioning in the person that was replacing me--.  EJ:  Oh.  BM:  But a lot of time to think about the connections of policy. There are a lot of babies there that hadn&#8217;t had access to prenatal care. There were parents who couldn&#8217;t be there because of job and paid leave issues or because they lacked transportation. The children in there were disproportionally children of color, children from low income backgrounds. And the policy wonk in me was like, &#8220;These are individual babies, but they represent something much bigger.&#8221; And so I&#8217;m in there on my phone trying figure out with the laptop while I&#8217;m sitting by the incubator looking up to see who organizes parents in this state because that was where I wanted to put my time.   EJ:  Is that how you became involved with Moms Rising?  BM:  Well, Moms Rising wasn&#8217;t here yet.   EJ:  Oh okay.  BM:  And so there really wasn&#8217;t anyone organizing parents. There were a lot of groups doing advocacy for children, doing it really, really well. But they weren&#8217;t, they weren&#8217;t organizing parents. And so when my son got out, I spent, I didn&#8217;t go back to part-time organizing work because he had physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy. But I did have time to get to know a lot of moms, and I started inviting them over to my house and sitting around this table and discussing policy.   EJ:  Oh wow.  BM:  And talking about maternity leave and talking about while our babies played and trying to do this sort of thing. I was calling it the Progressive Mommas Roundtable or something like that. My son was born in 2005, and then in 2007 I believe in Time magazine they had a Mother&#8217;s Day edition, and in it they mentioned this new start up that had started the year before, Moms Rising out of Seattle. And they were, gaining members, and I joined online and loved it. It was messaging that was exactly what I was thinking about and talking about, but I was emailing them. Apparently I find out later I was one of thousands of people emailing saying can I do this locally. How can I--? As a startup they didn&#8217;t have the capacity at that point to even respond.   And so they in 2000, late 2007 they put out an email in conjunction with MoveOn because MoveOn [sic&#8212;probably meant Moms Rising] was founded by one of the cofounders of MoveOn. Joan Blades helped cofound them both. And so they sent out a letter that MoveOn was having a protest. President Bush had vetoed that State Children&#8217;s Health Plans and wasn&#8217;t going to be funding. Here in North Carolina it&#8217;s North Carolina Health Choice for Kids. And so I went, and I had my Moms Rising t-shirt and my son was almost two, and I put him in a little doctor&#8217;s outfit, and he had his doctor&#8217;s kit and we had our signs and his wagon. We went over to the park in Raleigh, and I looked around and there were all these other moms with their kids, with their posters, and we all started like swapping phone numbers and soon the living room parties got bigger and the house parties.   A group of us formed, the five of us formed this group and started like actively organizing for a Moms Rising chapter and sending messages to Moms Rising National, &#8220;Please let us be a chapter. Please let us be a chapter.&#8221; We had organized hundreds of women before, and we couldn&#8217;t get a response, and it was because they were so busy. I mean they were being flooded by requests from over thirty states for chapter, which shows the demand and the need for this kind of organizing. So we didn&#8217;t get any response. We went ahead and took it on ourselves. We took the Moms Rising as this motherhood agenda that we organized around. Like we M is for maternity leave; O is for open and flexible work; T is for toxics, toxic chemical reform; H is for health care: E is for early learning and education; and R is for realistic wages, and we added an S for sick days. And then now we work on other issues that don&#8217;t necessarily fit in the model.   So we went and did all this research on what issues were being considered in the North Carolina General Assembly that matched up on all these policies and who was working on them. And we organized a big group of moms with our strollers. And we went and we put together our own little agenda and we went and started meeting law makers, and Speaker Hackney at the time opened up the conference room and took us in there and sat all of our children in the chairs around the conference table and talked to us about our agenda. And we were really lucky because Amy Tiemann who is a Chapel Hill mom and she is also the force behind Mojo Moms.  EJ:  What&#8217;s Mojo Moms?  BM:  It&#8217;s a website. She blogs, and she really does a lot of great support for parents. And she happened to be one of the founding board members of Moms Rising.  EJ:  Oh.  BM:  National Moms Rising. And she heard about us, and she lifted us up, and took us, went to national and said you need to, North Carolina&#8217;s organized themselves. You need to give them a chance. And they made us the first state chapter. And so in 2008, two weeks after I delivered my second baby, I had my first conversation with national Moms Rising about becoming a state chapter officially. And so for the next three years I worked a lot as an unpaid volunteer trying to get us up and going.  EJ:  What was that like with two young children and doing all that organizing?  BM:  It was really good. I was also doing nonprofit consulting at the time. So I was writing strategic plans and curriculum and program analysis and all that for these other nonprofits because I needed something that was for me, that let me use the part of my brain that I wasn&#8217;t getting to use otherwise. And a lot of it was organizing I was already, like I wanted to be out in the community with my kids meeting other people. And so it was a topic I was talking about on the playground happened to be maternity leave, then all the better. So it was a really organic outgrowth of where I was at and who I am. I was active in the Durham Mother&#8217;s Club and other mommy groups, and the issues and challenges that my family faces are not unique.   EJ:  So does that balance between motherhood and your work, that&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not a difficult&#8212;  BM:  No, it is difficult. It&#8217;s, because the lines are always constantly blurred.   EJ:  Right.  BM:  So it&#8217;s hard. I mean it&#8217;s hard to shut off because Moms Rising is wonderful, and I get to work from home and that I get to do things that I can take my kids with me to. Like when I go to the General Assembly, I would take them with me. When I did a training, I would take them with me. But it&#8217;s hard to figure out where it stops.   EJ:  Yeah, does it take practice to figure out where to draw that line? Or how do you--  BM:  It does. I still need practice because it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ll be out at a birthday party and I&#8217;m supposed to be in mom mode but instead I&#8217;m talking about the education cuts and the fact that my daughter&#8217;s kindergarten has twenty-seven kids in it, so those sorts of things. So the lines never are clear, and they&#8217;re even harder because the amazing women I have met through Moms Rising are now my best friends. I sent out a note on Facebook this morning. My daughter had a really rough day. She just started kindergarten. So it&#8217;s been a whole new transition and role change for her but for me too. And she had a rough go this morning, and I posted something on Facebook and within minutes I had texts and calls and messages from all these moms that I organize with that we do political work together, but they also like get that I&#8217;m crying because my baby is crying. And so it&#8217;s a beautiful community.  EJ:  How does that feel to be able to have this sisterhood of moms?  BM:  It feels incredible. It feels really, and it&#8217;s not just moms we say we&#8217;re moms and anybody that has a mom or anybody that has a belly button. And so some of our most dedicated supporters are they&#8217;re aunts or they&#8217;re uncles or they&#8217;re grandfathers. I have a grandfather that takes action every time I send out an email because they get why we need a more family friendly state and more family friendly country. And so I don&#8217;t think that the last thing I ever want to be in my organizing work is exclusive. There are women who aren&#8217;t mothers and would love to be. There are women who aren&#8217;t mothers and that&#8217;s just not the path that they would choose for themselves. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t care about kids, and that doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t care about the struggles moms face. So I think that when we do this work and I do this work, I try to be very intentional that it&#8217;s big enough for all of us, and we need all of us. But the relationships I've built with women and men out of this work it&#8217;s hard because the lines cross because they are more than just organizing partners. They are friends.   EJ:  Yeah, I was about to ask what some of the biggest challenges are for Moms Rising particularly in our current state.  BM:  It&#8217;s capacity. Parents have limited time. And they&#8217;re facing more and more challenges. The child care subsidy is being cut, with schools needing more help, with unemployment, with--. Parents are facing really hard times right now, which have made the issues you have in general about by being a parent with limited time even harder. And that the other part for us is capacity. You have me at twenty-five hours a week, and I have two moms at five hours a week that are on contract with me. But the demand is huge and we have people who want groups in Charlotte. They want groups in Asheville, and I mean we could do so much more. And so the hard part for me is always figuring out--, I&#8217;m a workaholic.   EJ:  I got that.  BM:  And if it&#8217;s good and our state needs it, then why am I not doing it? So it&#8217;s trying to recognize where the limitations are. And then how much good can we do with what we have and how do we get more.  EJ:  So something that I've always found to be really interesting and cool about Moms Rising [is that] you&#8217;re often cited doing these really creative approaches to activism.  BM:  Right.  EJ:  Can you describe the creative process around that or how--? I mean yeah. [Laughs]  BM:  Okay, so one of our biggest ones that we did early on was we did This Little Engine that Could for North Carolina&#8217;s children. And the creative process for that came that I got to take a shower by myself [laughter] without anyone banging on the door. And I was sitting thinking about how do we create a theme that carries through the entire legislative session that talks about why do we need a budget that recognizes the many ways we need to be supporting kids. In doing that how do we make it fun for families and how do we bring in people&#8217;s individual stories. And so my son was really into Thomas the Train at that point. So I must&#8217;ve had trains on the brain. And we wanted it to be something that parents could engage in with their kids in multiple different levels. So what we ended up doing was we created this North Carolina little engine that could. And in house parties for like months before the General Assembly went into session, we took wooden blocks that were painted, and our kids, we dyed macaroni noodle wheels, and our kids glued these wheels on at parties. And like when they played, we would glue them on and they would glue them on. And then we took labels, and there was like one for child care and one for K through twelve education, one for health care, one for I don&#8217;t remember, different issues. And then there was an engine. And on the engine we got these little wooden cutouts of trains, and the kids painted them and we glued those onto the blocks. There would be an engine and all these cars. And we put little hooks in between them that connect them altogether.   And the idea was that for like five or six weeks of the legislative session we would go back with a group of moms and kids each week, and we would deliver them a different train car every week. And so for the first week we delivered, we rented there&#8217;s something called Raleigh, Dolly the Raleigh trolley, which is this trolley that goes around downtown Raleigh. And kids love that sort of thing. So we got a bunch of engineer caps for kids and families, kids and moms and dads and grandparents and put about fifty people on this trolley and rode through downtown Raleigh. And then we stopped and we had a press conference in front of the General Assembly, and then we went in and we delivered all these trains, the engines to everyone. And we sent out action alerts. One thing Moms Rising does is our approach called layer cake organizing.   EJ:  Oh, what&#8217;s that?  BM:  It means there are multiple levels of engagement at every time. So with this one there was a creative action with the Raleigh trolley thing that got moms to the General Assembly. There was a media component where there was the press conference, but we also did parent like mom blogging online, Carolina Parent, WRL, Go Ask Mom, those kinds of places. We sent it all out to all the mother&#8217;s club listservs. But then we would send out an alert saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re headed to the General Assembly send us your stories.&#8221; And so for each of those trains we&#8217;d say okay this week we&#8217;re going, we&#8217;re talking about child care. Talk to us about the challenges your family faces in getting affordable quality child care. And all these stories would come pouring in. And then the next week is, &#8220;Okay tell us about education funding or education, why does education matter?&#8221; And all these stories would come in, and we&#8217;d put them together in books. And so the moms and folks that were at the General Assembly each week would deliver a train car and a book of stories so listed by city, all across the state.   It was our first big action so it was a way for us to build rapport with lawmakers. Like every week there was another Moms Rising member showing up. And we are not just legally a nonpartisan organization. We are truly a nonpartisan organization because motherhood is a universal issue. And conservative and liberal moms need paid maternity leave and access to child care, and we don&#8217;t feel like we gain anything by playing partisan politics. And so we, we go into every office just as friendly, just as warm, these are the stories from your community and we want you to hear them.   EJ:  How would you describe that relationship with lawmakers because I know that certain, sometimes it can be easier to step into an office. Sometimes it isn&#8217;t. Did it take a while for you to develop that?  BM:   We&#8217;re constantly developing new relationships. There&#8217;s been huge turnover in the General Assembly since the last, since we started. And so there are definitely lawmakers that are more welcoming to our message than others. I mean there have only been a handful of times that we have been treated poorly. And I appreciate that. I mean I feel like we try to approach offices with respect to even when they may disagree with us. And I feel like for the most part we&#8217;ve been treated with respect. So&#8212;  EJ:  For someone that worked with voting rights and all of the initiatives that you did when you were with what was--?  BM:  Democracy North Carolina.  EJ:  Yeah. How in all the work that you put into that, how do you feel that with all of this happening now, all that work?  BM:  Sucker punched. I mean it was, the day those votes passed I cried and cried and cried and cried, and then I screamed and then I yelled. But it&#8217;s quoted too often that it risks becoming a clich&#233;, but the whole arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice. I have to believe that. And all this work is interconnected. We try to, educate parents about the issues that matter to them but also make sure that they realize that voting is a big part of creating a society that they and their children deserve. And so I feel like the voting rights work, it all blends together. The loss of same day registration was particularly troubling to me because so many women benefited from that. The cutting of early voting poll hours is really hard because especially when you&#8217;re picking up kids from child care, you&#8217;re trying to get dinner on the table, you&#8217;re doing all that&#8212;it can be really hard to get to the polls on election day. And I have serious concerns about who&#8217;s going to be hurt by the limiting those hours. And all the data shows that the voter ID law disproportionately impacts women so because we change our names. We get married. We changed our names. We parents, young parents move a lot especially in these economically uncertain times. So I think we have to, it&#8217;s easy to get disheartened. It&#8217;s easy to think about all those hours of my life that have been turned to nothing. But there are folks who&#8217;ve put many more years in this than I have who reminded me and continued to show me that you take a minute. You take a deep breath and you go back in because we can&#8217;t afford not to. So&#8212;  EJ:  Do you take that same philosophy and mindset with Moms Rising moving forward? Are you using any of the voting initiatives and furthering&#8212;?  BM:  We are. We&#8217;re, voting is one of our key priority areas. We do something called Moms Vote at the national level where we make sure moms are educated on the issues, that they know if they&#8217;re registered to vote, or they have the links to get registered if not. Social media campaigns backing up and helping us encourage our friends because we know that the most trusted bearers of information are your friends. And so and women use social media particularly well. So trying to figure out how we leverage that to make sure women&#8217;s voices are heard. I spent all day Saturday with 120 amazing North Carolina women talking specifically about how we make sure that women turn out and vote. Moms Rising really tries to use humor a lot. If motherhood doesn&#8217;t teach you anything is that you have to have a sense of humor. And so like we&#8217;re working on, a video for this fall that&#8217;s about this picture of, you see these little fingers coming to the bathroom door and someone&#8217;s pounding on the bathroom door, &#8220;Mom, mom let me in mom!&#8221; And then you open, you look inside the bathroom and there&#8217;s the mom sitting there reading the voter guide, like sitting on the floor reading the voter guide. So do whatever you have to do to get engaged and get involved because that&#8217;s the reality is that we&#8217;re, we need to be involved even when we have all these other competing priorities.   EJ:  Where do you see Moms Rising in the next five years? Or do you have any certain pressing goals that you&#8217;re really looking forward to?  BM:  Right. I&#8217;m in full grant writing mode so I've got all this in my head right now. But to me the biggest thing is that people know what&#8217;s happening and what has happened in the General Assembly and that they also instead of using that just to feel, I think it&#8217;s easy to feel disempowered and to disengage because you feel like, &#8220;Oh well, they don&#8217;t ever do anything good over there. Whatever.&#8221; That we find ways to give people their power back. So this fall we&#8217;re going to be doing what we&#8217;re calling Supermom trainings all over the state and they&#8217;re going to be a short portion where we talk about like what&#8217;s happened and how it&#8217;s affecting families. We&#8217;re also going to be talking about okay, well, how does the process work? Because a lot of people are embarrassed to admit that they really don&#8217;t. I mean civics was a long time ago and they don&#8217;t really know how it works. So explaining that and then doing some citizen advocacy about let&#8217;s talk to our legislators. Let&#8217;s role play how that might go. Let&#8217;s talk about the power of phone calls and letters to the editor and let&#8217;s practice them together. So we&#8217;ll be doing those. We&#8217;re going to be doing, we have this program that we&#8217;re doing with national Moms Rising called Moms Rising Near You, which are more self-organized meet up groups so that folks can meet up with their friends and talk about issues and be engaged locally. We&#8217;re going to be doing a lot more story banking where we, everyone has a story, and it&#8217;s about connecting your personal story to the policies that are driving your opportunities. And so we&#8217;ll be doing a lot more working with gathering people&#8217;s stories and then helping empower them to be able to share their stories in their own voices.   EJ:  Sounds very exciting.   BM:  It is.  EJ:  So in wrapping up I was wondering if you could re-live your life completely over again would you change anything?  BM:  I would. I would&#8217;ve called my grandmother even though they told me not to. And I would have not stopped by work on the way home when my other grandmother was in a coma. Or she was, actually she wasn&#8217;t in a coma yet. I was really, really close to my Granny, and I felt like there was one, like there was just this one urgent pressing thing I had to do. So I stopped by the office and she slipped into a coma thirty minutes before I got there. And if I hadn&#8217;t gone to the office I would&#8217;ve been able to tell her goodbye. And those are the kind of reminders like don&#8217;t ever be able to disagree with someone, but do it with love. And don&#8217;t ever let work get in the way, like know what your priorities are. So those are the two things I would live over.  EJ:  Okay. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add?  BM:  I don&#8217;t think so.   EJ:  Okay, well, thank you so much for the interview.  BM:  Thank you.
