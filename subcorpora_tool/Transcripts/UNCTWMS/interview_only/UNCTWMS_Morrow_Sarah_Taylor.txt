JENNIFER DONNALLY:  Good afternoon. This is Jennifer Donnally, and today is April 14, 2010. I am at Dr. Sarah T. Morrow&#8217;s home in Raleigh, North Carolina, and it&#8217;s around 2:30 in the afternoon. Today I&#8217;m going to be interviewing her about her life and her involvement in the Department of Human Resources at North Carolina. With that, I&#8217;m going to ask you to introduce yourself.        DR. SARAH T. MORROW:  I&#8217;m Dr. Sarah Morrow, a physician who was born in Charlotte, North Carolina and have traveled a good bit in my training and all, but have lived the biggest part of my life in North Carolina.         DONNALLY:  And what was your childhood like in Charlotte, North Carolina?        MORROW:  Well, I was the daughter of a woman dentist, Charlotte&#8217;s first woman dentist, who graduated from the University of Maryland School of Dentistry in 1915.  My father was a physician who graduated from the Medical College of Virginia in 1915. They were married in that year and I came along in 1921. My brother came along in 1924. So being in a house of a dentist and a doctor, I think it&#8217;s very natural that my tendency was to study medicine, which I did.        DONNALLY:  Do you have any memories of the Great Depression, the 1930s?        MORROW:  Yes, I certainly do because my mother was trying to establish a practice of dentistry in Charlotte. This was about 1926, [19]27, [19]28, and a woman dentist was a rare thing in the first place.  I remember we used to have people who were knocking on our doors asking for food. They would ask for food and sometimes they would ask for money. If you gave them food instead of money, so often you&#8217;d find [the food] thrown on the ground. They really, they just wanted money for whatever purpose they had in mind.





Yes, we had to live rather frugally, and I remember my mother made homemade mayonnaise and it was delicious, very much like the Duke&#8217;s mayonnaise you find nowadays on the shelves in the grocery store. A sandwich made of mayonnaise with onions and green pepper and peanuts or pecans was a delightful sandwich to me, but you had to be young and you had to be hungry. [Laughter] Yes, I remember those years. We used to drive back to my grandmother&#8217;s home and she would have a chicken for us to bring back, one that she had wrung the neck and had it already prepared for us to bring back to our home to have for the meals. That was in the days when a loaf of bread cost about five cents, instead of $1.95.        DONNALLY:  So then you said you were interested in going into medicine. What were your college years like then?        MORROW:  Well, I went to Queens College in Charlotte for a couple of years because in those days, the 1930s and early [19]40s, Chapel Hill at the University did not admit females into their academic year until they were juniors in college. So I went to Queens for two years to get prepared for transferring to Chapel Hill, and did go to Chapel Hill then, and obtained a baccalaureate in medicine at that time. This is during World War Two and there was interest in getting doctors through college in a hurry because of the need for doctors in the war. So I was one of two girls in a class of thirty-eight boys when I entered medical school.  I graduated from the University of North Carolina with a baccalaureate in medicine and then transferred for the last two years because Carolina only had a two-year medical school. So the last two years, all of us had to transfer, and I transferred to the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. And I graduated from there in 1944 at the age of 23.



So I was called nurse a good part of the time after I got out of medical school. [Laughter] But it was an exciting time [to go] through medical school. Instead of four years, it was three years because we went summers as well as winters. When we graduated, we went into additional training in the hospitals.  I had decided to be a pediatrician, but took a rotating internship first of all in Charlotte Memorial Hospital, it was called at that time, and then transferred to Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia for two years in training in pediatrics. Back in those days, we saw a lot of rheumatic fever and polio, things that, thank goodness, our antibiotics and other good drugs have helped us overcome.         DONNALLY:  Did you face any discrimination other than being called &#8220;nurse&#8221; a lot?        MORROW:  It wasn&#8217;t really discrimination. It was more, I was so young, and I was inexperienced as far as clinical work was concerned. I think the nurses, they all called me doctor, but the patients would call me nurse because they thought I was so young, I had to be, I couldn&#8217;t be a doctor. [Laughter] But it was an interesting time, and I did not feel that I was really being discriminated against. In fact, I remember when I was at Grady, how the waiters would look after me even though I came in to supper late. They would make sure they&#8217;d put back a steak or something, whatever I had, they were serving for supper, to make sure I had a good meal. So I found a lot of people were  looking out after me in spite of my youth and my being a woman.        DONNALLY:  And then how did you meet your husband?        MORROW:  We were classmates in medical school. Of course, both of us were busy with the war and with training. He was in World War Two and then he was sent back in the Korean War later on, but we did not get married until after we&#8217;d finished our training. I received further pediatric training when I was at North Carolina Memorial Hospital back in 1959 to [19]60. I went back to school to get my master&#8217;s degree in Public Health in 1959. I did an additional brush up training in pediatrics in 1960.         DONNALLY:  What did you do then? What do you recall of the 1950s then?        MORROW:  Well, I tell you after getting married, my husband and I had six children, three boys and three girls. And we had six children in nine years. And when he finished his service in World War Two, he went back into training in Baltimore for surgery. After he&#8217;d completed his residency and training in surgery, we moved to South Carolina to a little town called Chester, where he set up his practice in surgery. They needed a health director in the public health department, and in 1953, I decided I&#8217;d take a job part-time as a health director for Chester. I got so involved in that. It was an interesting job, inspection of dairies, the dairy farms, inspection of restaurants to find out that they were serving food appropriately, and just learning about the care that was needed of people who were low-income and desperate for need of medical care in many instances. In fact, they also needed dental care, and I even pulled a tooth in my kitchen at one time. But I think the big thing I got from that was exposure to all of the different aspects of public health and the need of services in public health in communities. And that was why I decided to go back to the School of Public Health in 1959 with six children and a husband. [Laughter]        DONNALLY:  How old were your children at this point in time?        MORROW:  Well, let&#8217;s see. In 1959, my youngest child was three years old, and I had little stair steps on my (11:18) as you can guess. [Laughter] Of course, two of them were not in school and the rest were in school.        DONNALLY:  Did you have any help?        MORROW:  I had a maid in Chester whose name was Maddy who came to work with me about 1952. She stayed with me thirty years, and she really helped raise those children because with me working so much of the time and being out of the house, she took the responsibility of being a proxy mother and did a wonderful job. The children were quite devoted to her and she to them. Now when I moved out of Chester and went back to the School of Public Health in Chapel Hill, she went with me for about two or three months, and then she felt like she and her husband had to get back where he made his living. So they moved back to Chester and then after I finished getting my degree in September of 1960, Maddy decided that she would go to Greensboro where I had accepted a job as the associate health director. Dr. Everett Evenwood was the health director at that time, and he needed an assistant. And with me fresh out of school and fresh out of training in additional pediatrics, he decided that he wanted me to come work for him in Greensboro. So we bought a house in Greensboro, sold our house in Chester, and bought a house in Greensboro. I went to work for the Guilford County Health Department.        DONNALLY:  Did your husband follow you then with his career?
MORROW:  Yes, he went to--. He was not well. He had returned from Korea with some real problems, and so he was under psychiatric care. And then he developed cancer of the larynx and he died quite ill and when he was only fifty-four years old. So the burden of bringing home the bacon sort of fell on me at that time. So I did quite well as the associate health director and we obtained a special project from the Children and Youth program out of Washington. It was called Children and Youth at that time. C&amp;Y. We received a grant. It was a total of one million dollars to provide medical care for fourteen thousand low-income children in Guilford County.  And that program really did. It was [due to] the cooperation of the physicians in Guilford County that first of all I obtained the grant, and secondly I became the director of the grant, the program. It was with the cooperation of the doctors that it was so successful because they chipped in and worked to help us make it good and provided services. The pediatricians were especially good to help us with the care of the children.
DONNALLY:  What kind of services were those in the 1960s?
MORROW:  We provided all kinds of medical care, dental care, laboratory services, injections to prevent disease, and hospitalization if they needed it. So we really provided the whole category of services that were needed to provide good health for these children.
DONNALLY:  And it was mostly low-income children.
MORROW:  Yes, these were low-income children.
DONNALLY:  How many of them were low-income minorities?
MORROW:  How many of them were--?
DONNALLY:  Low-income minorities, at the time.
MORROW:  Oh, probably the majority were minority. We had a few Latinos, blacks. We had Caucasians, too. Many of the farm families found out about the services and began to come. We had a mobile unit, as a matter of fact, that had both medical care and dental care in it, and could go around the county to provide the services. We were able to hire additional nurses. I hired nurse practitioners, pediatric nurse practitioners who were wonderful. We could see a hundred patients in a morning because four nurse practitioners would be seeing the patients and I would go along behind them. They already knew what to look for as far as the illnesses in the patient and the complaints. They would follow up on them and they would take calls at all hours of the day and night to make sure the patients were getting the services they needed when they needed it, and that the parents were relieved of anxieties when the child became ill in the middle of the night. And then as I say, we provided hospitalization. If the child needed surgery or if the child had broken an arm or anything, we provided those services, too. So it was a very comprehensive program, and it was very successful in Guilford County.
DONNALLY:  Did it serve as a model for any other programs across the state?
MORROW:  It was only C&amp;Y program that was funded through the Children&#8217;s Bureau. It went on for years. Into the 1970s, we were still getting some funding in Guilford County. So we were able to keep up the program over a period of time so they really did see a big change. For example, in the dental carries in children, we didn&#8217;t have to see them losing their teeth before they got their permanent teeth.   [Brief interruption due to phone call]
DONNALLY:  So how long were you the director of health in Guilford County?
MORROW:  When (0:18:38) became ill, this was about 1968. He became quite ill, and they appointed me as the health director then because he retired. So I was health director from 1968 until I left there in January 1977.
DONNALLY:  And did you leave to take on--? Yes, that was during Governor Hunt&#8217;s first term.
MORROW:  Yes, he was elected in the fall of 1976. So it was December 7, 1976, I remember that date because it&#8217;s--.
DONNALLY:  Pearl Harbor.
MORROW:  Pearl Harbor day. So I was asked to come down and meet with him at the hotel. And he had received a letter from me. No, I take that back. The senator at the state legislature, Senator Smith, had asked me to write him a letter making suggestions as to what I thought needed to be done in the health field, particularly the public health field.  I wrote him a two or three page letter outlining what I thought some of the changes needed to be. He showed the letter to Governor Hunt, and Governor Hunt read the letter and said, &#8220;I like the way this woman thinks.&#8221; And he says, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to interview her.&#8221; So the next thing I know I get a call in Greensboro and it&#8217;s a trooper calling for Governor Hunt. When I got on the line, Governor Hunt made sure how I spelled my name. He thought it was Murrow. M-U-R-R-O-W. Edward R. Murrow, who was from Garden City in Guilford County. He was from Atlanta, had relatives at least in that area. And I explained that my name was Morrow. [Laughter] Well anyway, he wanted to--. He had already apparently checked on me through the doctors in Greensboro, and I&#8217;m sure that we had people who are in the Democratic Party who had checked on me.

And he wanted me to come down for an interview on December 7, which I did, and met him at the hotel. We were going to talk for about thirty minutes, and an hour-and-a-half later, the trooper&#8217;s knocking on the door, &#8220;Governor, you&#8217;re late for your next appointment.&#8221; By this time, he has asked me a lot of questions and he had some wonderful ideas for services for the elderly and services for children. And some of his ideas were a little impractical because of the limitations of professionals to provide the services. So I told him, I said, &#8220;Governor, you can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; And he says, &#8220;Well, why not?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Because you have a limited number of doctors and so forth to provide all the services,&#8221; but I said, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the way you go about it. You let the teacher act as a proxy parent and find out--. She observes those children in more hours of the day than many of the parents do, and she&#8217;ll pick out the problems in the children. This is what we&#8217;d already done with our C&amp;Y project. She&#8217;ll pick out the problems in the children and refer those children for service, pointing out whether it&#8217;s a fidgety, not able to sit still, whether it&#8217;s inability to see, inability to hear, complaining of headaches, whatever. She&#8217;s the one who&#8217;s going to notice whether the child is limited on the playgrounds.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Well that makes sense.&#8221;

So we parted company that afternoon. And I thought, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the end of it.&#8221; I did not expect to be offered a job as Secretary. I just went down there to fulfill the request by the governor to answer some questions. And the next thing I know, there&#8217;s a newspaper reporter in Greensboro who&#8217;s calling me, asking me if I&#8217;m the new Secretary of the Department of Human Resources. It&#8217;s now the Health and Human Services Department, but it was Human Resources at that time. And I told him, &#8220;No way. I have no intentions. I have no expectations of being Secretary.&#8221; Well he said that, &#8220;What I hear is that there is somebody from Guilford County who&#8217;s going to be appointed the Secretary of Human Resources.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a fellow here in Highpoint that&#8217;s very active in politics.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, I heard it&#8217;s a woman.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t heard a word.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221;






So he hung up and the next thing I [got] a call from the Governor&#8217;s office asking if I would accept the job of Secretary. I turned him down three times. I said, &#8220;Governor, I can&#8217;t afford to. You want to know why not? Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;it only pays thirty-six-thousand a year. I&#8217;m making forty-two-thousand here.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Oh?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ve got children in college.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got expenses here in town.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;It will increase my cost of living to come to Raleigh and keep up this place because of my children.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, let me look into it.&#8221; So he calls me back and he says, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t do anything about your salary now, but we can get it up in July.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;But Governor, I just don&#8217;t need that job.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I need to be here with my family.&#8221; Well, he says, &#8220;You know we&#8217;re going to take care of you when you get down here.&#8221; So he called me back then again. And I said, &#8220;All right, Governor. I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221; [Laughter] But I know he was about to throw his hands up, but I think it was appropriate that I go ahead and [took] that time because I had things pretty well under control in Greensboro as far as the C&amp;Y. It was running itself, you might say.
So I came on down here and I got an apartment and stayed in the apartment until I bought this house in 1979. But that was in January [of 1977] that I came down here, and I tell you, I thought I was going to get fired the first year because we hadn&#8217;t learned to communicate, the governor&#8217;s office and I hadn&#8217;t learned to communicate. And I finally found out that if we let each other know what we&#8217;re going to do before we did it, then there was an understanding as to why I took certain actions. And so we learned to communicate real fast. [Laughter] But anyway, I thought he would change Secretaries after the four years were up, but he called me during the Christmas holidays and asked me if I would continue to be the Secretary for another four years, and I told him yes I would, that there were other people who wanted the job, though. And he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m well aware that there are others who would like to have the job, but I want you. And if you will continue, I would appreciate it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Governor, if you want me, I will continue.&#8221; So I did. So I was there for the full eight years, and then I left to join Electronic Data Systems for twenty-and-a-half-years.
DONNALLY:  So were you really involved in Democratic Party politics before the appointment?
MORROW:  No, I was not active politically. I was too busy being a doctor and a momma. So I was surprised because ordinarily you expect the Secretaries to be picked from a political group. And I was a Democrat.
DONNALLY:  Born and raised Democrat?
MORROW:  Yes, I was born and raised a Democrat. And my county commissioners who--. You know the county commissioners employ the health director through a Board of Health. And I had a group of five. I think there were four Republican county commissioners and one Democrat who saw to my service in the Guilford County Health Department. And the Board of Health, the chairman of the Board of Health was a--. Let&#8217;s see, part of the time it was a Democrat, and of course the county commissioners were serving, too, on the Board of Health. So, I was a Democrat, but I was not politically active.
DONNALLY:  So what were some of the very first things you had to learn as a Secretary of Human Resources?
MORROW:  Well, fortunately I had a lot of experience in public relations. And I had a good bit of experience on radio and television explaining things when we had an outbreak of a certain disease or when a child became ill with scarlet fever or any kind of illness. You usually had to get on the radio and explain, radio or television because television was beginning to become much more popular than the radio, even. But I would say that I had enough experience with dealing with the public and advocates that it was to my advantage when I came down into this political job because there are always advocates that are out there wanting their way and wanting more money for their particular programs or projects. And I had learned to deal with those kinds of things in Guilford County as well as in Chester County because of the experience that I&#8217;d gained in public health all along the way was very helpful.
DONNALLY:  So what were some of the very first assignments you were given by Governor Hunt, to expand programs, initiate new programs?
MORROW:  Well, what we wanted to do was to improve the health of children. We wanted to reduce our infant mortality. And so with that, we were interested in making sure of healthy pregnancies and healthy outcomes of those pregnancies. Then we were interested in the children once born, of making sure we detected any disability or any handicap early in life, and mak[ing] sure then that the child got appropriate services for that disability or handicap. And then we also wanted to make sure when the child entered school that they were able to take full advantage of the learning, which meant that when the child was four years old, four and five years old, that we were again examining those children, especially those from low-income families, to make sure that they had not developed, for example, vision problems or hearing problems or scoliosis or anything that might handicap them in school.




And so we started a screening program for the four-year-old children. We had the screening program for the newborn infants because ninety-nine percent of our babies are born in hospitals now, although the number of home deliveries may have increased some, but I doubt it. So with the babies being born in the hospital, you had the hospital nurse looking at them, and then you had a public health nurse going into the hospital to check on them. They were picking up any problems, imperforated anus, other kinds of handicaps that your child might have, clubbed feet, making sure that there was no mental problem from prolonged labor and so forth. So were checking these newborns out as well as the four-year-old children to make sure that we were picking up problems as early as possible to remedy those problems so that there would not be any future handicapping.
DONNALLY:  What was the political context of North Carolina in the mid-1970s when Governor Hunt came in?
MORROW:  It was quite a contrast to what it is today because Governor Hunt had such excellent support from the General Assembly. He had his lobbyist and his public relations people who were very alert and aware to take care of any problems that arose. He was most astute in governing. He was recognized for his honesty and his integrity and he still is. Governor Hunt has been an outstanding governor in both his first eight-year term and then his second eight-year term. The people of North Carolina, I&#8217;m sure, have a great deal of respect for him.




So with the corporation of the General Assembly and the excellent lobbyist he had working with the General Assembly, we were able to get through a lot of programs, including an expansion of our programs for the elderly, as well as children. And we improved our in-home services, visitation into the homes to pick up problems that the elderly may have, and to help the families take care of the elderly in the home, and to make sure that they didn&#8217;t have to go to an institution unless it was absolutely necessary. Most people like to stay in their own homes and we respect that because if they can maintain their health and the mental faculties and stay in their own home, why, that&#8217;s the ideal place for them. We had services, too, where they were transported, elderly were transported to facilities where they were given lunch and allowed to be involved in quilt-making, making brooms, doing things that were making things that could be sold to the benefit of the group, the group home that they were coming to. There&#8217;s a name for that. I can&#8217;t remember it now, but the different places that they would come into, the elderly would come into for our services.
DONNALLY:  Do you think one of the factors that Governor Hunt--. He liked what you had to say a lot, but do you think he was particularly excited about appointing a woman? Because you were the first woman Secretary of Human Resources, were you not, in North Carolina?
MORROW:  Yes, yes, I was the first woman Secretary of Human Resources, but there were other women that Governor Hunt appointed. Sarah Hutchkins was Secretary of Cultural Resources, and we were good friends. And then Jane Patterson later became Secretary of the Department of Administration after Joe Grimsley left, but these were very capable women, very knowledgeable. Now what were you asking me?
DONNALLY:  I was asking perhaps a little bit about, I mean Governor Hunt was very clearly committed to feminism and the advancement of women in the state.
MORROW:  To what now?
DONNALLY:  The advancement of women in the state.
MORROW:  Yes.
DONNALLY:  And mainly I&#8217;m thinking much of what I&#8217;ve read about him in terms of the struggle to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in North Carolina.
MORROW:  Right.
DONNALLY:  If you can remember any sort of aspects of his struggle or were you so involved with the health programs--? Like what do you recall of the equal rights struggle in North Carolina?
MORROW:  Well, I remember the legislation being passed. I don&#8217;t know that I was ever directly involved in any of the programs that were designed. I, of course, felt very comfortable working with women myself in my own department and had a young lady working very closely with me who was my right-hand and I had a gentleman also who was working very closely with me who was my right-hand and left-hand.
DONNALLY:  Is that Lucy?
MORROW:  Lucy [Bode] and Richard Rideout. Lucy Bode had experience with the legislature. Her father had been in the legislature. So she was excellent to keep me informed of what was going on in the legislature that would directly affect our department. Richard Rideout was excellent in programs and personnel, and he could deal with the personnel issues and when we had to hire people, and he was good for interviewing and getting the full information on them. But the two of them just blended so perfectly in balancing out my needs. I could not really have run the department without those two because I knew I could depend on them. They were loyal to me and very knowledgeable, very bright people. We&#8217;re still good friends after all these years. It&#8217;s nice to know that you have a family affair, that you&#8217;re depending on each other, and you can have confidence in each other, and it does make for a smoother running organization when you know you have that trust and confidence and competence.
DONNALLY:  Now you mentioned earlier that there were doctors who wanted your job. Was there any sort of upset that you were the one who received the Secretary of Human Resources, any doctors who were--?
MORROW:  No doctors were wanting it. There were other people.
DONNALLY:  Okay.
MORROW:  They were not doctors. Doctors didn&#8217;t want the job. In fact, doctors make a lot more money practicing medicine than they do as a Secretary. But no, I don&#8217;t, there were people who were interested in the job, yes, but the Governor apparently felt like we had established a working relationship that was going well enough that he did not need to make any changes there in the Secretary&#8217;s office.
DONNALLY:  So I&#8217;m going to talk about something that&#8217;s a little controversial to see what you remember. What do you remember in terms of right after Governor Hunt got appointed, abortion became legal in the United States in [19]73, but then the sort of big debates in the 1970s was over Medicaid coverage of abortions for low-income women? Do you remember any debates or how the health department found that it could cover those abortions?
MORROW:  Medicaid, being federally funded, had to comply with any federal rules. And my recollection is that the federal funding for the abortion issue was in cases of rape or threatened life of the mother. One of my concerns here in North Carolina was not only rape and risk of life of the mother, but incest. I felt that as long as it was legally right for the wealthy women to have abortions, that it should be legally right for poor women to have abortions. Poor women who could afford another mouth to feed even less than the rich, and so I persuaded the legislature to appropriate some state funds for abortions so that--. For example, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls who got pregnant, and sometimes it was incest in the family, and they had no business first of all in getting pregnant, but they didn&#8217;t have control over it because its usually the male in the family who has control there. And secondly, they should not be forced to have a baby at that young age.










So I thought we needed to have some state funds to abort these youngsters. And so the legislature, even though many of them were very opposed to abortion, they still felt that, you know--. They felt, I think, the same as I did, that to force a teenager to have a pregnancy and carry it through and have a baby that she was not able to take care of was not an appropriate thing to have happen. So our legislature, as I recall, appropriated two-hundred-thousand dollars in state funds for abortions for poor women, which would cover, of course, incest, rape, and risk of life of the mother, just as the federal government did, but it might cover some other situations where the pregnancy existed and was not needed nor wanted. It&#8217;s a shame that we can&#8217;t prevent unwanted pregnancies altogether, but the sex drive apparently is such a strong one for procreation that it alters behavior, especially if alcohol or any other kinds of drugs are involved. So I think it&#8217;s much more desirable to prevent unwanted pregnancies than it is to have to deal with them after pregnancy has occurred.
DONNALLY:  How did you go about convincing or proposing--? Was it just kind of a backroom consensus that the legislators didn&#8217;t think that teenage girls should be having to carry [a pregnancy to term](0:48:29)?
MORROW:  No, it was--. I&#8217;m sure I discussed this with people in the appropriations committee and explained my views of what I was dealing with and what I was seeing because in the health department itself, I had dealt with girls who&#8217;d come in and they were pregnant. Maybe they had arranged through some private enterprise to have an abortion, and then they&#8217;d come back in wanting to get contraceptives and I&#8217;d explain they&#8217;ll have to go and get their mother&#8217;s or father&#8217;s--. They have to have parental consent to even have contraceptives. So I think these were things that I discussed with the legislature, that so often we put so many barriers up because as the girls would tell me, &#8220;You know, my parents don&#8217;t give a damn.&#8221; And that always disturbed me that the parents could not care enough about their children to make sure that they were preventing an unwanted pregnancy. And here the girls were trying to look after themselves and I&#8217;d have to get parental consent for them to have contraceptives. That just didn&#8217;t make sense to me.











So we discussed a number of legislative issues. I do know that as time went on, the two hundred thousand dollars, I know was reduced at least fifty thousand dollars because there were objections to abortions being made available through state funds. And I think ultimately the fifty thousand was omitted from the budget, but the legislators at that time were very willing to listen and they were open-minded on so many things rather than just having already pre-decided what they felt.  [Brief interruption due to phone call.]
DONNALLY:  We were talking about attempts to provide contraception and contraception to teenagers.
MORROW:  [Unintelligible due to lack of microphone]
DONNALLY:  Oh, would you put your microphone back on?
MORROW:  The family planning programs in our local health departments, our county health departments do an excellent job of providing means for people who do not want a pregnancy to avoid those pregnancies. I think that in itself has lowered both maternal mortality and infant mortality by providing contraceptives to those people who are not able to or disabled or are not in a financial position to afford pregnancy.
DONNALLY:  During the second term of Governor Hunt, do you remember any sort of political hot water that you all got into as a result of efforts to offer contraception to low-income and teenagers? Did anybody begin to start targeting you?
MORROW:  You know I don&#8217;t remember that being a major issue with us. I don&#8217;t recall. Can you cite what--?
DONNALLY:  It was an issue in the 1984 run for governor, for which Governor Hunt wasn&#8217;t running because he was running against Jesse Helms for the Senate spot, but it came up in the campaign of Governor Martin, who promised he would cut all of the state abortion fund and stop offering contraception.
MORROW:  Well Governor Martin and I are good friends, by the way.
DONNALLY:  Oh. [Laughter]

MORROW:  I knew Governor Jim Martin when he was a county commissioner, and I was a county health director. So I got to know him at that time.
DONNALLY:  He was one of the people who appointed you at Guilford, then, one of the Republicans?
MORROW:  No. He was not in Guilford County.
DONNALLY:  I was going to say he&#8217;s not from Guilford.
MORROW:  No, he&#8217;s Davidson County, not Davidson. It&#8217;s Davidson, North Carolina, but that&#8217;s Davidson County. I guess it&#8217;s Mecklenburg County. Davidson is in Mecklenburg County. He was a Mecklenburg County commissioner, as a matter of fact. I don&#8217;t recall anything about abolishing contraception.
DONNALLY:  Not contraception. Programs offering contraception, just particularly targeting sex education programs for teenagers and then the offering of contraception to teenagers without parental consent.
MORROW:  Well, I don&#8217;t, frankly I don&#8217;t remember any of those. You&#8217;ve got to realize now we&#8217;re talking about twenty-five years ago, and I just do not recall that being an issue with our department because apparently there was enough support in the legislature to recognize that family planning is a good and necessary program for public health departments to have. And I don&#8217;t remember any opposition from physicians nor the political party at that time. So I would say I don&#8217;t recall any big changes occurring in the program.
DONNALLY:  Do you think that is in some ways due to the fact that North Carolina&#8217;s had such a history of offering family planning services as a state in the nation? I mean it was the first state to offer them in the 1930s.
MORROW:  We have offered family planning services for as long as I can remember. And I think the high infant mortality at one time was one of the things that precipitated a good family planning program. That high infant mortality has come down dramatically, but it&#8217;s still higher than some of the Third World countries, but maybe it&#8217;s not the Third World countries, but it&#8217;s still higher than some of the other countries that provide good care for their mothers during the pregnancy. You know you&#8217;re asking me to remember things that I can&#8217;t even remember things in the family twenty-five years ago. [Laughter]
DONNALLY:  It&#8217;s so hard to believe that at the same time as all these things in your career is going that you&#8217;re raising six kids and getting them through college and all the transitions.
MORROW:  It&#8217;s been an interesting life, to say the least. [Laughter]
DONNALLY:  You commented a little bit about this earlier, but what was your relationship with Governor Hunt like? You said you had to learn how to communicate your first year.
MORROW:  Yes.
DONNALLY:  And then after that you--.
MORROW:  We understood each other and we did communicate. The Governor had his Secretaries and his immediate staff to meet Monday mornings at 8 o&#8217;clock at the mansion. And that gave us a chance to update the Governor on anything that was going on, any hot potatoes that might be in the department, or any issues that might be coming up. We could also alert him to personnel as well as programmatic issues. I think this open discussion that we had at that dining room table on Monday mornings was a very good way for us to open up communication and to be sure that we were on the same wavelength as far as action that we would take about certain issues. So I think we learned to communicate there and also when things came up that I felt he needed to know about, I would pick up the phone and call his office. He had an excellent secretary, Barbara Buchanan that I could always leave a message with.
DONNALLY:  What do you think were some of the great accomplishments that you achieved as the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources?
MORROW:  Well, we did lower infant mortality. We did increase the services for the elderly, and we improved services for children. That was probably, in the standpoint of Human Resources, the things that we did. Of course, mental health has always been an issue, but mental health was well-controlled and I think that the care that was provided in the hospitals during the 1970s and early 1980s was as good as one could provide with the difficulties that are -- the patients themselves are very difficult to handle. And then sometimes the staff is not as well trained or doesn&#8217;t have the temperament or the patience that&#8217;s needed to work with some of these patients, but by and large, we did not have issues of patient abuse that you&#8217;re seeing nowadays. So I think we did a pretty good job of providing the care that was needed to those who were in need.
DONNALLY:  Is there anything you&#8217;d like to add?
MORROW:  No. I just so appreciated the support that the Governor&#8217;s office gave me and the legislative body gave me in those eight years because they were an unusual group of people who were working together to do the best that they could for the people of North Carolina politically and financially. I was very devoted to Governor Hunt and I still am, and to his wife. She&#8217;s a lovely lady, and they have very fine children. And to the legislative body, you couldn&#8217;t find finer people to work with. And I found those people both in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
DONNALLY:  Who were your key legislative allies?
MORROW:  Senator Kenneth Roy. My legislative allies?
DONNALLY:  Mmm hmm.
MORROW:  Senator Kenneth Roy was, he was a very thoughtful man and very stern, but he was--. You know, they would listen. And Senator Arlie Harris, he was a fine man. He ran a funeral home way up in Kings Mountain. Representative Billy Watkins, he was from over in Granville County. Senator Harold Harrison, he was down in Kinston. Senator Mary Seymoure from Guilford County, she was a great gal, died of pancreatic cancer.
DONNALLY:  Yes, I&#8217;ve heard some stories about her as well.
MORROW:  And let&#8217;s see. There&#8217;s another senator. Who was that? A little woman. Oh, come on. Oh, heck. She was a delightful lady. Who was that little woman down from the eastern part of the state? Senator Bob Warren from Greenville. Oh, I&#8217;m not thinking of all these people. What was her name? Oh, goodness. She was a delight. And then we had Margaret from Winston-Salem, Senator Margaret--. Oh, I&#8217;m losing out on names now, from Winston-Salem, but she was one of my real friends, Margaret (1:05:23) her name.
DONNALLY:  We already said names are very hard to remember thirty years after the fact.
MORROW:  Huh?
DONNALLY:  Names are very hard to remember thirty years after the fact.
MORROW:  I wish I could pull out my--. If I had all that information that&#8217;s upstairs tucked away somewhere in one of those boxes, oh, my gosh. I&#8217;m wanting to think of the little woman who was Rosa--. What was her name? Down in the eastern part of North Carolina. She was a petite woman, very petite, but she was a very strong and effective legislator. Oh, come on. I&#8217;ll have to call Lucy and ask her who she was. I can&#8217;t remember her name, but oh, she was so delightful. I thought the world of her. That&#8217;s what happens when you get to be eighty-nine-years old, you see. Your memory fades and it doesn&#8217;t recall things very well, especially twenty-five and thirty years ago. [Laughter]
DONNALLY:  Well, again, is there anything you&#8217;d like to add before we call it an interview?
MORROW:  No, I think I&#8217;ve been very fortunate to have had the experiences that I have had and to have had the support of the ladies and gentlemen in the political arena, because you cannot do things unless you have the support of those who are in powerful positions. I was very fortunate to have come along at the time that I did, and I don&#8217;t envy Secretaries in today&#8217;s world. [Laughter]
DONNALLY:  Well, thank you so much for this interview and for your time this afternoon.
MORROW:  Well, I hope that I&#8217;ve given you a little information that will be useful to you. As I say, the archives of history probably have a lot of the literature, information on budgets, information on legislative matters that I cannot recall. But those were interesting years for me from 1977 in January to December of 1984. The new secretary was sworn in in January of [19]85.
DONNALLY:  Sounds wonderful. Thank you so much.
