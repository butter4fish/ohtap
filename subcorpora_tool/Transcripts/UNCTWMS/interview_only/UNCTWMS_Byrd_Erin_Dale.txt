 CARA SCHUMANN:  Today is June 12th. This is Cara Schumann with the Southern Oral History Program interviewing Erin Byrd for the Moxie Project&#8217;s Women Activism and Leadership Project. So I&#8217;m going to start off by asking you what was your childhood like and where did you grow up?  ERIN BYRD:  So I grew up in a military family and I spent the time in Texas and in Germany. The strongest memories that I have growing up are Biebecheim, Germany from the time that I was six until I was about twelve years old. So six years we lived overseas. I grew up with my mom, my dad, and I have two younger sisters now. One was born in Texas, and the other was actually born when we were in Germany. [I spent] a lot of quality time with them, a lot of traveling. We would take weekend trips, and I remember we would go to restaurants to eat out. We would visit different places in Germany. So I feel like it was [a] pretty insulated and pleasant&#8212;childhood.  CS:  So what was it like in Texas? Then when did you live in Texas?  EB:  I lived in Texas. I was even younger when I lived in Texas. So probably Texas, so I would say I was born in Maryland, and then my family moved to Georgia for a very brief period of time, then to Texas. And I don&#8217;t even actually know how long we lived in Texas. It was as couple of years, and then we moved to Germany. And in between there was a year in Korea, and when they left Germany, they moved to Virginia,    a couple of places in Virginia and Newport News, and now they live in Gloucester County and pretty much almost, it felt like every three years except for the six years we lived in Germany, it was always like restarting, new friendships, having to start over to meet new people, try to fit somewhere. That&#8217;s been my story.   But when I grew up in Germany--, I grew up in the [19]80s. And during the [19]80s the Red Army was fighting imperialism there. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar, but there were like car bombings and a lot of security stuff where I&#8217;d come home from school, and there&#8217;d be a car blown out in a parking lot. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay. Guess we can&#8217;t play outside today.&#8221; The Germans really wanted us out of Germany, and if you study you know we have military bases all over the world, but there weren&#8217;t any military bases in the United States from other countries. And I learned that when I was really young. And as a military brat I don&#8217;t think I understood it until I was grown, but those were some of the memories that I had during childhood. I don&#8217;t know that I ever felt unsafe, just questioning, &#8220;Why is this happening and questioning like why would people not want us in their country without people really explaining what it meant.  CS:  So do you feel like watching that revolutionary influenced how you felt about the world when you came back to the United States?  EB:  I always questioned the military. It&#8217;s interesting because there&#8217;s a real critique of the military industrial complex, as it&#8217;s called, and the role that the resources in our country going to war really oppress brown people in the rest of the world or lower class people in the rest of the world. What is the point of proving that America is this military might and what role do we, or should we, actually have internationally in trying to direct other countries in their business? One of the things it did was it made me a socialist, which is probably not what you would expect, but in the military you have dental care, health care; you go to the PX; you have reduced groceries. Everybody has basic benefits in the Army. And like I was saying to you, my parents grew up to tell me to &#8220;Get benefits, get benefits, get a job with benefits. That&#8217;s what we want you to do.&#8221; So that was something my parents found really important and ultimately because they don&#8217;t pay their health care costs. They have been able to accumulate resources for our family and their retirement and such. So it&#8217;s been beneficial, in that way. And a lot of African Americans actually go into the military because it gives you equal access to these kinds of resources because it pays for college. Both of my sisters are officers in the Army. One of them is a major, and the other one is a captain in the reserves. And they have no college debt. Whereas I am working a nonprofit and I have considerable college debt. So it offers some benefit, and it made me question, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we have those resources in the rest of the world? Why can&#8217;t we have them in the rest of the country? Why can&#8217;t everybody have health care? Why can&#8217;t everybody have dental care? Why are these resources only given to some and not to others when we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world?&#8221; So I grew up seeing everybody that I was surrounded by have basic care in many ways. And I was questioning, why it was not something everybody has the benefit of.   The other thing it made me question is status that&#8217;s unearned. So in the military obviously there are ranks, and you can be a sergeant first class, second class whatever [after] twenty years of experience because it goes up E1, E2 to become sergeant, which is [an] enlisted leadership role. And then there are officers. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with how the military rank.  CS:  Vaguely.  EB:  So there&#8217;s enlisted and then there are officers. So you can be your age coming into the military [with] no experience at all and your rank is higher than somebody who has worked twenty years because they&#8217;re enlisted and you&#8217;re an officer. I always thought that didn&#8217;t make any sense to me that people could have authority over you when they didn&#8217;t have as much experience as you. And I mean that&#8217;s how the military is structured for whatever reason. I always found that really intriguing. The other thing you get, you obviously get more pay. There&#8217;s different living quarters for officers. So we lived on a different side of the base because my father was an officer. The neighborhood that I grew up in when we came to the States so this is probably from the time I was--we moved back in [19]86, and I was twelve if I&#8217;m right. We moved back to the States and I was sixth grade. And we were again living on a military base in Virginia and officers also had different quarters. So we lived in a house on a different side of the base, and then enlisted soldiers and their families lived in apartments on another side of the base. When you interact with people, if you&#8217;re an officer and you interact with somebody that&#8217;s enlisted, it&#8217;s called fraternization. You&#8217;re not supposed to do that. You&#8217;re allowed on the job, yes, but every day [contact is] frowned upon. So he would make comments like, &#8220;Oh you can&#8217;t play over there,&#8221; or whatever. It wasn&#8217;t like they were [sound effect] strict about it, but it was the culture that I grew up in. So I questioned like, &#8220;Okay everybody has benefits, but when I leave everybody doesn&#8217;t. And people are going hungry or they are dying in hospitals because there&#8217;s no health care.&#8221; When I grew up in a system where everybody at least had basic health care. [I] wonder what that&#8217;s about. And then this rank where people have more authority when they don&#8217;t have experience, or in my mind hadn&#8217;t earned it. I guess you earn it by being credentialed and getting a college education, but that doesn&#8217;t actually mean you know anything of substance, certainly not anything about leadership. When you ask me about childhood that&#8217;s what I think about, but that&#8217;s the system I grew up in, and of course I believe even now that if you send somebody to war, we do a terrible job taking care of veterans. These people are sacrificing their lives for us, for our &#8220;freedom&#8221; and they do this. And when they come home they get nothing for it, or they get maltreated, or they don&#8217;t get what they have earned or were promised before they went to war. It&#8217;s immoral how that&#8217;s happening. I didn&#8217;t even know that you had to wait eighty-six days to get help from a VA hospital in Fayetteville, which is something on the news right now. So that was my childhood.[pauses] Flashback. [laughs] Yeah, man. Oh my God yeah.  CS:  So what were the like gender roles in your family if you grew up on a base, which is obviously a male dominated world with your father and your mother. Did your mother work outside the home as well or was she in the military?  EB:  My mother worked for the military. She worked for Army Community Service, which is basically like being a social worker in the civilian world when I was growing up. She ran the food bank, and they provide emergency support to soldiers, counseling, things like that, and she also for a period of time really worked on domestic violence. I still remember one night where we were having dinner and she had to go to a soldier&#8217;s apartment because he was beating his wife and she tried to hit him with a car. This was in Germany when I was little. So she dealt with a lot of cases of sexual assault and cases of domestic violence in the military.   And now my mother, she still works for the military. Then she went to work for the Coast Guard for a few years. She did very similar work because [the military is] almost like a different-- it&#8217;s not a different world, but it&#8217;s like a world within a world. So everything you can imagine having in a civilian world they have in a military world. Social services, my father was a finance officer. He managed the budget for the military base. So that&#8217;s what she did. Logistics, equipment maintenance, it goes on and on and on. She still works for the military, and she is the director of the Wounded Warriors program on the military base that she works at. So she cares for veterans when they come home, helps them find jobs if they&#8217;re leaving, computer r&#233;sum&#233; stuff, has programs that are actually just for veterans and particularly wounded warriors, veterans that have come back and are wounded in war. So that&#8217;s what my mother does.   In terms of gender roles, my mother always worked. As long as I can remember, she has worked out of the home, maybe not when I was little-little, but my mother&#8217;s a pretty strong person. She really cares about what she does. She&#8217;s very passionate about veterans or about whomever she&#8217;s serving. She does direct service work and she&#8217;s very passionate about that. She&#8217;s a really strong [laughs] woman and really supportive of all of us. And when I say us, I mean me and my sisters.   CS:  So do you feel like her being a strong woman influenced you in any ways in like the work you do now or your ideas of how gender works in the world?  EB:  I would say that my mother influenced me a lot, particularly around issues of race. I don&#8217;t really know how to even articulate it, but she always made us proud that we were black, not necessarily in the way like someone who grew up studying the Black Panthers and Stokely Carmichael, because my parents are probably more conservative than that. They didn&#8217;t really talk about that kind of stuff when I was growing up. I learned a lot of it when I was an adult, but certainly they would make us aware of injustice if it ever showed up. They made sure that they weren&#8217;t abused on their job because they were black and if it happened it would be a discussion that we would have at home. My mother has filed suit against the military a couple of times for different things when she felt like she was being mistreated or being undermined or being harassed or bullied on her job. She&#8217;s a really strong woman.   I don&#8217;t know if she would define herself as a feminist. I&#8217;m going to ask her. But she certainly doesn&#8217;t take anything off of nobody, and when I say nobody, I mean like the store clerk, the waitress in the restaurant, the boss on the job, the subordinates on the job, her children, her husband, her neighbor. My mother will dig into you. She will dig into you, and I know a couple of times she was digging into someone in a store or something. I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Mom, they really&#8212;&#8220; &#8220;Don&#8217;t you interrupt me when I&#8217;m trying to tell someone!&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Whoa, okay.&#8221; So she definitely taught me that I should use my voice, that I shouldn&#8217;t take no mess from nobody. I&#8217;m just as good as anybody else. So that was what my mother and my father raised us to know and that level of confidence has helped me like even now. It doesn&#8217;t matter where I am. I look people in the eye. I&#8217;d say that it helped me develop a lot of confidence in my abilities and in my voice.  CS:  Wonderful. So those racial dynamics that you described within their jobs in the military, did that bleed into your life on the bases in various places?   EB:   I don&#8217;t know if it bled in to my life, but I definitely know that I knew I was black. I knew I wasn&#8217;t white. I grew up around white people my entire life. They were everywhere. And I knew I wasn&#8217;t white. I also felt mistreated in ways, but it was not [in a] being called out type of way. It was very elusive to me what was actually really happening. We would have conversation in high school in civics class and stuff, and I would be the one digging into them when they said anything that might be really construed as being racist or prejudiced. I would be on all the other white kids and even black ones if I felt like they needed it. It wasn&#8217;t until I went to college and started to study sociology&#8212;I&#8217;m a sociology major and study systems&#8212;that I understood like, &#8220;Okay, this is what racism really is. This is what inequality is; this is why it exists. This is how it manifests and shows up in my life and in other people&#8217;s lives and this is why my people are suffering as a result of it.&#8221; It helped me to understand what is actually happening, and that led me to this work. I think it was the understanding that actually I didn&#8217;t have to take it. I could fight against it. In some way, shape, or form I could do something about it. I feel like while I wasn&#8217;t necessarily dealing with stuff directly while I was growing up, it was definitely present.   CS:  So you went to William and Mary, correct?  EB:  Yeah, I did.  CS:  Can you describe William and Mary in terms of race since you said you came to this awakening about racism? So what was William and Mary like? Because it is a private school if I understand. What was it like in that world?  EB:  Have you ever been to Williamsburg?  CS:  I have, yes.  EB:  I would say that Williamsburg is where people go to see how it used to be and how they probably want it to be again because it&#8217;s Colonial Williamsburg and the campus is connected to Colonial Williamsburg. So you can run from my dorm down to Colonial Williamsburg and run back and that would be like a mile and a half or something like that when I was there. I went to William and Mary when I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do. A friend of mine was going there, and so she encouraged me to join her. Yeah. I regretted it after I got there. I regretted it for a couple of reasons. One reason was because I felt like it actually wasn&#8217;t the best place for me, and I wasn&#8217;t really a part of it. The second thing, I regretted that it wasn&#8217;t very diverse. In my mind it&#8217;s not like a UNC. I don&#8217;t remember that feeling. What I mean is a lot of white young people, there&#8217;s a good core of them that seem to be relatively progressive. And Chapel Hill is a progressive place, right. So it wasn&#8217;t like that at William and Mary. But it was thirty minutes from my parents because my parents lived in Newport News so I could go home a lot, and I had friends in the area because it was where I grew up. It was a culture shock in that I had all this freedom and I could do whatever I wanted to do. So I found that to be a little bit over the top. I was kind of wild while I was there. So I had a lot of fun. I think what I wish is I&#8217;d taken more advantage of the opportunities. Like I think if I had gone to college now, I would have a completely different experience than at that time because I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do or what I wanted to pursue or even really who I was.   It was a time at William and Mary where it wasn&#8217;t welcoming to people of color at all. I didn&#8217;t feel that. We had an office of multicultural affairs, but there wasn&#8217;t like a black student union or a Latino student union or it wasn&#8217;t anything like that. And there were 400 black students when I went there. It was out of 8,000 students, I think. Something like that. It was a very small number of black students there. Maybe it was&#8212;I&#8217;d have to go back and look. But I feel like it wasn&#8217;t a lot of us. So many of us went to a summer program because like they said, &#8220;Your math isn&#8217;t high enough; your this isn&#8217;t high enough.&#8221; So I met a lot of people before I actually started. And when I graduated a lot of people that started that program with me didn&#8217;t graduate with me. My own roommate didn&#8217;t graduate with me. So I feel like a lot of people didn&#8217;t matriculate, and I don&#8217;t feel like it was a lot of support for us there. There was a multicultural affairs director named Dean Harding who has since passed on who was my mentor. I would say [she was] somebody who had a deep affect on me [as] another woman leader, but she left before I graduated and a number of black faculty had left while I was there. So it just didn&#8217;t feel like a place for us. It was probably the only place that I was ever called &#8220;nigger&#8221; aloud in my life. That&#8217;s the kind of place it was to me when I remember it. I was walking across campus, and some guys were drunk and they were screaming. You know how they do. That was my experience. I was really glad to graduate. I actually have only been back once since I graduated from that school. Yeah.  CS:  So around what time then did you break into the social justice community? Was it at William and Mary or was it after?  EB:  Yeah, interestingly no. It wasn&#8217;t at William and Mary. I was kind of radical. They would name me radical, but I wasn&#8217;t an organizer in that I wasn&#8217;t being trained to do anything with my frustrations. When I graduated from William and Mary then I went to graduate school, I met the father of my kids now. We got married. We&#8217;re not married any longer, but when we decided to move to North Carolina in 2000, I interviewed for some different jobs. I actually did some call[ing]. I called this guy named Winnette Hoggins who ran Democracy South, which used to be what Democracy North Carolina is before it split. [I also called] Peter Walls who I still know now, and Lynice Williams who&#8217;s since passed on with North Carolina Fair Share. And I did networking and I asked people who I should talk to, and I got this job application to be the coordinator of Voters for Clean elections, which is a campaign finance reform coalition. I interviewed for the job and I got it and I went &#8220;Oh, well okay, that&#8217;s cool.&#8221; I think I got it because I was young, passionate and again the sociology class, we had studied money and politics so I had a sense of what it was and I had studied it some. I could talk about it in a way. I think one of the other reasons was because I was a person of color, and they didn&#8217;t have very many people of color in their movement at all. The campaign finance reform movement is not very diverse because I feel like people of color are concerned with all these other issues, and so you don&#8217;t give a lot of thought to how you should fund elections with public money. That&#8217;s not something that would occur to people. That makes it hard for that to be a diverse issue, but of course it impacts everything else as does the budget and other types of issues.  CS:  I know that while working for that coalition you guys got that first piece of public funded legislation passed.  EB:  That&#8217;s right.  CS:  How was that experience of having a success in this kind of movement? Is that what inspired you to continue doing it or&#8212;  EB:  Interestingly enough, when the Judicial Public Financing Bill was passed, which was seen as a success and a victory, there were those of us who actually wanted full public financing of elections and felt like that was a compromise. And it was a compromise. So I feel like I had mixed feelings about it, but there&#8217;s also like what can you realistically do. And interestingly at this moment because then the Democrats were in control of the legislature, and it was like they could&#8217;ve done what they wanted. They had the majority. Another example in my mind now of why I&#8217;m now probably very non-partisan or very unaffiliated as a voter though that may change&#8212;when the Democrats were in power, they didn&#8217;t really do the things that they should have done. Now we have these Repubs in power, and they&#8217;re terrible, but if you think back there were things that they did, like raising the minimum wage to seven-twenty-five. But those things were such fights. Things that shouldn&#8217;t have been fights for people who were representing working class, working families. They did a poor job of representing us. I don&#8217;t want to say poor job, but I remember so many things that they could have done that they didn&#8217;t do. Now they&#8217;re out of power, and everybody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, we should go back to how it was&#8221; and it was not like &#8220;how it was&#8221; was awesome. That&#8217;s the truth. What was good about that was yeah, it was a victory that I can put on my r&#233;sum&#233; or whatever, but what really sticks with me are the relationships that I built with people doing that work. [I still have relationships with a] lot of people that I worked with then. I think the other thing was how do you get these groups of people to work collectively, and I think it was really a training ground for me. I learned a lot from the really smart people that were part of the coalition at that time. They were really supportive, and some of them even allowed me a lot of leverage in how I might want to talk about the issue and how I might want to do things. So we did something like &#8220;the color is green&#8221; and we had different people from different issues come and talk about how they&#8217;re affected by campaign finance reform. Whether you were for the environment or you worked in health care or you worked for minimum wage, whatever your issue is. Money and politics impacts that because we don&#8217;t get to decide who runs for office. The cost of running for office is really high, still is. Average working people can&#8217;t afford that. So then you&#8217;re represented by people who are already moneyed up or wealthy and not by working class folks because they have got to go to work to pay their bills. I felt like at the time this is really an issue that affects everybody and it does. But you combine that with the role of government and how the tax system is organized and how the voting system is organized to one, suck all the money out of working class people and then B, make sure they can&#8217;t vote. And then campaign finance, we don&#8217;t have people to represent us in the first place&#8212;they really hoodwinked us into thinking that this democracy, this democratic process is working for everybody and everybody has an opportunity to honestly engage in it and that&#8217;s actually not true.   CS:  So as you learned that the democratic process didn&#8217;t work and became more non-partisan, is that what motivated you to move to different nonprofits from this coalition or how did that influence the rest of your nonprofit work?  EB:  So when I was with Voters for Clean Elections, there was a point where I got tired of it after the judicial campaign bill passed, I really felt like I needed to do something different. I was burned out on money and politics, and I was tired of what I felt like was this continuous struggle to get members of this coalition to see that talking about campaign finance reform in isolation really wasn&#8217;t moving folks that looked like me. So I left that work, and I went to work for a people of color organization that had all people of color on the board. I found that I had a lot of freedom. They allowed me to bring my son to work because at that point, when Jai was born in 2004 is when I left the Voters for Clean Elections and I went to work for Southerners for Economic Justice. In that work I learned the importance of having enough capacity to actually fulfill your vision. Because we didn&#8217;t have a lot of resources or capacity. It was a very small organization. While I felt really excited about the work we did, it was only me. I was young, younger than I am now so what I felt were real struggles in that work because it was deep and I felt really good relationships. I learned a lot. I did some youth leadership work with some young women. We did some women of color organizing, bringing together lots of different women of color. We worked on the minimum wage [bill] that passed. I don&#8217;t even remember what year that was now, 2000, and--, oh you&#8217;ll have to look it up. I felt like we did really good work, but what I wasn&#8217;t able to do in the midst of doing the work was build capacity for people to be able to have more infrastructure, more staff, more resources, and that was a real struggle to try to make that happen and now that organization and after I left it closed its doors. I think it lasted another year or two and then it&#8217;s not operating anymore. It shut down.   Then I got offered the job at Blueprint, which is where I work now. I got offered that job in 2007. I was with SEJ, I was very active with HK [Historical Thousands on Jones Street]. I was one of the first folks in the steering committee, at the meeting. It was really excited about that work and that&#8217;s because when I was at SEJ we had started this women of color legislative thing and women of color organizing, and we had a big lobby day and we&#8217;re moving that work, and when it got time to do the next lobby day [side conversation with daughter]. That&#8217;s going to be on the interview isn&#8217;t it? [laughter]  CS:  No, don&#8217;t worry about it.   EB:  Well, it would be part of my story. Oh my God. The person that was organizing that with me asked Reverend Barber to come in because her organization was funded by the general fund and didn&#8217;t feel like they could really be out front and didn&#8217;t feel like the Southerners for Economic Justice had the capacity to take it to the next level and it became the people of color legislative day. And then out of that came HKonJ and now the Forward Together work that&#8217;s going on. I feel like that was this lineage around organizing different groups to come together around multiple issues instead of focusing on one issue which has always been part of my work. We can&#8217;t do this work alone.   CS:  So do you feel like you get to finally work outside of your silo with Blueprint?   EB:  Yeah.  CS:  Can you talk a little bit about what Blueprint does and--.  EB:  So Blueprint is this collaborative of a bunch of different nonprofits, and ultimately what we&#8217;re trying to do is to get our partners to work more effectively together [and] to see that we need to be more than the sum of our parts. It&#8217;s great to come together in a coalition, but if people aren&#8217;t really in a relationship with each other and if they don&#8217;t have shared power where they&#8217;re making decisions together about the work that they&#8217;re doing and how the expenses, the resources are being expended, then you don&#8217;t have a coalition, right. We do a lot of work to get people off to vote. So it&#8217;s about how do you evaluate more effectively the work that you&#8217;re doing. How do you have more reflection in your work? How do you communicate more effectively based on values instead of on facts because what we&#8217;ve found is that you can spit facts at people all day long. But there&#8217;s something called cognitive dissonance, right? So if you hit me with a fact, if I have a certain frame of reference and your fact doesn&#8217;t meet my frame of reference I&#8217;m throwing away your fact. I&#8217;m not changing my frame of reference. And so we&#8217;re talking to all these people, and we&#8217;re spewing things at them. But we&#8217;re not resonating with them with what they care about. Blueprint is really an effort to increase civic engagement, get more people voting, engage in the public dialogue, as well as help organizations communicate more effectively based on values and get groups to work more effectively together towards that end. We hope that from these efforts more policies that benefit the public good [will be implemented], so health care is an example, or election day registration would be another example, or anti-discrimination policies on the job and increased wages for folks, things that [improve the quality of life of] working folks and what we call the rising American electorate are people of color, women, and young people.  CS:  So do you feel like it&#8217;s a lot to take on that many issues within an organization?  EB:  So we don&#8217;t actually work on issues, right. What we&#8217;re working on is a strategy that gets people more effectively together. I think that it&#8217;s hard to get people to work together, but these social problems that we&#8217;re faced with are really large and the idea that your organization by itself will resolve them is a fallacy. No organization really has the capacity, the resources, the staffing to take on some of these big problems by themselves. It&#8217;s really critical that we figure out how to connect, how to find shared purpose and how to work together, how to be strategic, what is strategic, what is a strategy, how do you build a shared strategy and implement that. That&#8217;s the kind of work that we&#8217;re trying to do and it&#8217;s been in the background. It&#8217;s not an organization that&#8217;s seeking to have all this public credit for its work. What we&#8217;re really trying to do is build the capacity of our partners to meet the goals or the missions of their organizations.  CS:  So as you&#8217;ve done all this organizing work, how do you feel like you&#8217;ve balanced being a woman of color and being in the South and having to organize in these networks? Do you find it difficult to do in the South, particularly in North Carolina?  EB:  What do you mean? Say more about that.   CS:  I know that HKonJ was born specifically out of people of color coalitions and how most nonprofits in my experience in the South tend to be dominated by people not of color. Do you find it difficult to be the token person of color in the first coalition you worked with? Do you find that that&#8217;s been a pattern through your social justice work?  EB:  [sighs] I don&#8217;t think I used the word token. It&#8217;s an interesting&#8212;  CS:  That&#8217;s just my interpretation.  EB:  No, it&#8217;s an interesting interpretation. I think that it did feel that way sometimes. I didn&#8217;t use the word, but I did feel that way. I feel like, [whispers&#8212;let me see what I would say] the challenge [of] balancing being a good mother, which is my priority, with working, I imagine that&#8217;s the challenge that many women face. What&#8217;s also a challenge is white supremacy and racism and the systems and how they show up and how people in our organizations work together. So you&#8217;re dealing with real people, but these people have their own perceptions&#8212;and you know how they grew up&#8212;and I think the challenge really is working with white people who don&#8217;t even understand that they are racist. In my opinion all white people are racists because you&#8217;re in America, [laughter] and it&#8217;s kind of like being in the water and not getting wet. It&#8217;s not possible in my mind. The lack of acknowledgement of that and of how our strategies to improve the conditions for everybody need to be rooted in, &#8220;How do you dismantle racism? How you dismantle patriarchy?&#8221; and these types of things so that we actually can look at each other eye to eye and really work together. I feel like it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m actually trying to balance because you&#8217;re unable to balance that. What I try to do is be honest. I try to call it out when I see it. I try to call out the patriarchy in a lot of this work. So we have and the ego and the control and the, even the tokenizing of women. So if you need women to show up to show that you have gender diversity, but women don&#8217;t actually have power in making the decisions about the strategy, then you&#8217;re tokenizing women and the same with people of color. Black people, brown people, Native American, otherwise. The other thing I try to balance is not doing that because the nonprofit industrial complex almost sets you up to tokenize because your grants and all these types of things, they don&#8217;t actually give you the time to build the relationships with people that are necessary to actually have real coalition. I feel like it&#8217;s a lot of urgency in our work and a lot of &#8220;Hurry up and get something done&#8221;, and I also feel like a lot of people are not connected to their own feelings or their own emotions around this stuff. So it&#8217;s kind of like they&#8217;re, [banging on table] &#8220;What&#8217;s on the agenda, what&#8217;s next, what&#8217;s the strategy, what&#8217;s the data, blah, blah, blah, what does the research say.&#8221; and not connected to the either the people that they&#8217;re working with or understanding that the work that we&#8217;re doing is actually impacting actual, like real people. They&#8217;re not statistics, and so the challenge is balanced, it&#8217;s not even something I can even balance or even try to balance. We don&#8217;t try to balance that stuff. What I try to do is raise it when I can raise it and then not participate in it to the extent that I can stand it. I really can&#8217;t stand it. [I] try not to replicate that in my own work, which is hard when other people are doing it around you. I think it&#8217;s really important to try.  CS:  Understandably. So you mentioned trying to be a good mother as your top priority. Is it really difficult to do nonprofit work and be a mother? Is that very challenging? Even in a progressive world that should celebrate working families is that difficult?  EB:  I think yes. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s difficult just because it&#8217;s a nonprofit or because we&#8217;re working mothers. I would imagine that women who are trying to advance their careers and really trying to compete with people who don&#8217;t have children, I would think that that&#8217;s hard in any type of work you&#8217;re doing because people don&#8217;t really honor motherhood and they don&#8217;t make space for children in these spaces that we have. Like they&#8217;re not really conducive for parenting a lot of times and they should be. We even try, like for Blueprint we pay for childcare if you need it and somebody will come and sit with your children and do activities and stuff with them. But even that is in another room sometimes, not necessarily in the same room where our meeting is. I feel like it is really hard. The other thing that&#8217;s hard about it is flexible hours. So like my job doesn&#8217;t end at five o&#8217;clock. Like I&#8217;m talking to you tonight. It&#8217;s not necessarily my job, I make a distinction too between what is my job and my work, but so my work is really hard to manage because I volunteer for other things other than my job. I am on the board of a foundation called Southern Partners Fund that supports rural organizing across the South. It&#8217;s really important to me. I&#8217;m their board chair. And then organizing Fertile Ground, which is this food cooperative that we really need here in southeast Raleigh. I feel like it&#8217;s hard to balance the work. I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about that lately. Then of course it&#8217;s my job at Blueprint. So my children, my Blueprint, Fertile Ground, and Southern Partners Fund is sort of how I organize my work to say it broadly and some days I&#8217;m just feeling like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221;   One of the things that I&#8217;ve decided for myself, so Erin&#8217;s purpose is to work very hard so that in ten years I&#8217;ve helped create systems where my people can have ownership of their labor. So what I&#8217;ve become clear about, and this is something that I have been thinking about and studying so that I feel like a lot of my people are struggling because their work every day, they don&#8217;t own. And their passion, they&#8217;re not able to produce income off of their passion, and they don&#8217;t own their labor. I feel like when you have so many people that don&#8217;t have the opportunity to figure out what their passion is and then earn an income from that passion in some way, shape, or form, then the economy doesn&#8217;t work. Capitalism is not working for us. That&#8217;s basically the bottom line of it. What I&#8217;m saying, using all these other words. That&#8217;s the bottom line and so for me, cooperative economy is solidarity. Economy is this idea that we need to build [a] different economy, even if it&#8217;s a local economy that supports people owning their labor and owning the enterprises that they work in and sharing the power and the governing on their job. That&#8217;s actually my purpose to figure that out and to grow that movement. So the question of balancing the passion with the parenting is a, I struggle with it. I bring my kids in there. I bring my kids to meetings and they engage in that. We have a lot of conversation about it. I also try, I really try hard if I&#8217;m with them to focus on them. But I find that the technology and all these things that has us plugged in all the time&#8212;sometimes I&#8217;m addicted to my work is what I am. So I&#8217;m addicted and then trying to pull away and focus on what I need to do with my kids and make sure they eat like you saw us doing. Make sure they feed themselves and do their chores. I&#8217;m like clean your room, but my room is dirty. I&#8217;m like oh my God. Oh my God. How am I going to manage all of this? I just love them to death and tell them how smart they are and I support them in every way that I possibly can do it. The other thing that I try to do is let them know that I&#8217;m not perfect. I&#8217;m fallible. I make mistakes and so hopefully by me showing up as a real person it&#8217;ll give them the space to show up as real people in their own lives and not beat themselves up so badly when they themselves make mistakes.  CS:  So you mentioned that your passion is creating this kind of labor, you own your labor and you feel like your people don&#8217;t own their labor. So can you give me an example or elaborate on your passion, and how you came to that passion?   EB:  So we live in a capitalist system and that system is set up by basically paying as little for people&#8217;s labor as possible so that basically wealthy people, corporations benefit. So when I say, and I don&#8217;t actually own my labor right now, so when I say to people &#8220;Ownership of your labor&#8221;, that means in your mind that you work every day in something you really love and you&#8217;re earning an income off of it and it&#8217;s benefiting you, and it&#8217;s a decent wage. I&#8217;m really now studying cooperatives, are you familiar with cooperatives?  CS:  Somewhat yes.  EB:  Somewhat. What I find is a lot of the women, or leaders that I admire like Ella Baker, A. Philip Randolph, they were also supporters of cooperative economy and economic development. It&#8217;s this idea that we come together as a group and we start an enterprise, and we own the enterprise, and we share the benefits and the profit at the end of the year as an example. Why I think that that strategy is important is it&#8217;s not one person owning a business and everybody else works for that person. Everybody actually owns the business. Then you come to work, and you, you&#8217;re coming to work for your business, not working for somebody else&#8217;s stuff, right. And I feel like, so there are two sides of this actual labor and work part of it, but then there&#8217;s also this part that I&#8217;m thinking about a lot which is how are you, how are we encouraging people to find out what their passions are? And then figure out from that, from what they enjoy doing every day or have the skills to do, how they earn an income off of that instead of going to work every day at some job that you just can&#8217;t stand but you actually go because you have to feed your family. Like what if you could actually find ways to feed your family off of something you loved to do every day? I came to that because as somebody who has been, we didn&#8217;t even talk about all the organizing I did whether it&#8217;s organizing people or organizing organizations, at the end of all of this work I find that my community, my neighbors aren&#8217;t doing any better. Like even if you raise the minimum wage to seven-twenty-five, a damned hamburger still costs six-fifty. I feel like all of the organizing work doesn&#8217;t actually meet people&#8217;s daily needs. I want to figure out how do I organize and also meet people's daily needs. When I started organizing, there was this idea that there was different organizing. If there was a change there&#8217;s organizing, there&#8217;s advocacy, there&#8217;s litigation, there&#8217;s direct service. I might be missing one. I can&#8217;t think of what the other one is. And so when you and I used to look down on director service, &#8220;Oh they&#8216;re just putting a band aid on the problem. They&#8217;re not really organizing to find the root cause of the problem and fix it.&#8221; In all of this work I&#8217;ve been doing to try to find the root cause and fix it, I haven&#8217;t thought that people are still hungry. Like they still need this band aid. So how do you find organizing strategies that meet both needs simultaneously? So cooperatives, one, they have general principles around education, around membership, economic participation around governance, one person one vote so you&#8217;re actually governing your entity, making decisions about your entity, coming to work for something that you own, but you&#8217;re sharing the power and the decision making in that enterprise. In my mind if you are willing, if you have that power on your job to vote and you own your labor, then maybe you&#8217;re less likely to take crap because you vote on your job. Maybe you&#8217;re more likely to vote period. You&#8217;re more likely to understand what a budget is and the implications of that and these other things because you&#8217;re participating at that level. It may not be for everybody, but for me I find it might be the best solution for this moment particularly this terrible recession and we keep saying to our young people &#8220;Go get a job, go get a job, go get a job.&#8221; But there are no fucking jobs. There are no jobs. Where are people getting these jobs from? They don&#8217;t exist. Or the skills are mismatched or whatever. So what we need to figure out is, how do we help people create the enterprises that we need so they own their labor and their passion? I think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got to do. I don&#8217;t necessarily mean there are other places like Mondragon in Spain, this whole region of Spain that&#8217;s run by cooperatives. So [in Mondragon] the bank&#8217;s a cooperative; the university is a cooperative; the automobile repair shop is a cooperative; the grocery store is a cooperative; graphic design is a cooperative, all of the whole thing is run cooperatively, like the entire region are majority cooperatives employing hundreds of thousands of people and making millions of dollars a year in profit, multiple millions of dollars a year, hundreds of millions. That is a huge economy all by itself. So what if I could over the next twenty years do that in southeast Raleigh.   CS:  So is that how you came to your food coop?  EB:  That&#8217;s exactly how because they closed two grocery stores here. Originally I thought it should be a coffee house, and I asked some people to have dinner with me. We talked about it. We were organizing this idea of a cooperative coffee house. The other part of it is a cultural center because there&#8217;s not a lot of cultural stuff in southeast Raleigh. Particularly there are not coffee houses. There&#8217;s not a lot of places where you can go and hear spoken word and stuff. There are places in other parts of Raleigh, just not in southeast Raleigh. They closed two grocery stores in this community. I moved here recently, but where I used to live the grocery store in that neighborhood had closed down, and they closed one down on New Bern Avenue. They recently opened IGA on one of them. But this area is in desperate need of more groceries [and] also a higher quality of food and more options around the food. If I go to this grocery store up the street and I look at the meat, they have like something called chuck eye something. When my dad came here to visit, he was like Erin that&#8217;s not actually a real cut of meat. I was like really Dad. You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me. So I took a picture of the cut of meat and take it back to him because he&#8217;s like I never even heard of that. What is that? But seriously, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;What in the world? Is that a (       ), I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; So, if I go over there I can find a T-bone or a rib eye. I can&#8217;t find that up the street from my house. And so because the powers that be may think that this is a lot of working class people and we&#8217;re not interested in buying it or it&#8217;s not economically feasible. I mean when they closed the Kroger grocery store down, they didn&#8217;t close it because it wasn&#8217;t profiting. It wasn&#8217;t profiting enough. We just need more options for healthy food here. We need a new economy here. We need more culture here. And I feel like the Fertile Ground is one place where those three things are coming together for me and, I hope, for other people. So we&#8217;ll find out.  CS:  That&#8217;s really, that&#8217;s really inspiring. For sure, no definitely. That combination is great. The other thing about culture I wanted to ask you is, I know you&#8217;re part of a singing group. Can you touch on that? Just what that serves in your life perhaps.  EB:  I&#8217;m not active with the singing group anymore. I used to be very active for a number of years. It&#8217;s called the Fruit of Labor singing ensemble, and it&#8217;s the cultural arm of Black Workers for Justice. What we believe is that you should have music with a message and the message should have music. But this kind of idea, and it&#8217;s really important to me too, is culture in our work. And when I say culture, I don&#8217;t necessarily mean [a] somebody&#8217;s singing you a song or reading you a poem or entertaining you kind of culture, because that&#8217;s what people typically think of when they think of culture. There is a framework called cultural organizing, which is essentially about being thoughtful about what you&#8217;re creating. God I wonder if I&#8217;m saying this right. I have a sister in Ann Brown out of Mississippi and she says, &#8220;Culture is the what.&#8221; You&#8217;re like, &#8220;The what. What does that mean?&#8221; But it&#8217;s like everything. It&#8217;s how are we organizing our meetings. What does it feel like to be in this community with you doing this work? What are our values that we&#8217;re working together? How are we talking about the issue? How are we honoring each other? There&#8217;s ways of teaching and educating using culture as well&#8212;to use culture, whether that&#8217;s poetry, plays, music, video, all of these other kinds of things as ways of communicating messages and educating people and engaging people from the heart instead of from the head. I also feel like it&#8217;s honoring the innate culture in a particular community as you&#8217;re doing work, and so I loved the singing ensemble. I would just say there came a point where I wasn&#8217;t enjoying [the singing ensemble] as much as I used to and I decided a number of years ago if I really hate or dislike being in a space with you for whatever reason then I don&#8217;t actually have to do it. I can chose not to do it and it got hard for me. There are a number of reasons and that&#8217;s a different conversation. So I&#8217;m not active with the singing ensemble. The singing ensemble is still going, and it probably will for a long time. I&#8217;ve written a couple of songs and I enjoy cultural work periods. That was a way for me to practice other types of organizing.   CS:  So I think we&#8217;re coming to the end just for time&#8217;s sake probably. Is there anything that you want to talk about, you feel like I didn&#8217;t ask you or touch on or that you feel like is really something burning in your life that you need to be part of your story or history?  EB:  Hmmm. I guess the thing that I would say should be part of my story, that I hope was part of my story anyway when I die is some kind of phrase on my tombstone that said &#8220;She loved.&#8221; Because I really, I guess I really feel like one of the things that is preventing us from really connecting and seeing all of us as collectives instead of as individual people living our own lives is a lack of love that currently exists in this moment. I feel like people are really concerned with themselves but not concerned necessarily with everybody else. And that we see ourselves as individuals and not part of a collective body. For me, the cooperative is another way of building this community that&#8217;s diverse in many ways too. I really feel like we&#8217;re dealing with a lack of love and a real selfishness and a real sense of individualism, and I think capitalism encourages that in deep ways that we don&#8217;t quite in our minds even realize. I will hope that a part of my story is to counter that energy and to bring love into our relationships and into our movement and to acknowledge that we have to love each other as people and find ways of accepting each other to actually have this world that we&#8217;re all seeking that&#8217;s better than what we&#8217;ve got. So that would probably be an important part of my story.  CS:  How do you think you put that love into your work so far?  EB:  I think I put it into my work by really building real relationships with people and by caring what happens to people and also by like being the kind of person that you can connect actually with. So as an example, if you asked me &#8220;Erin, how are you doing?&#8221; I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;I will tell you.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, girl, what happened to me (            )&#8221; &#8220;Whoa, I wasn&#8217;t expecting all that.&#8221; Well, you asked me how I was doing. Don&#8217;t ask me if you don&#8217;t really want to know. Don&#8217;t ask me a question if you don&#8217;t want the truth. So I  feel like that&#8217;s part of it as well as really loving my people and really loving being black and really loving being a mother and really trying to encourage relationships to develop between other people as well because that&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;re going to make it any better. It&#8217;s kind of like with each other it&#8217;s got to be better. This idea that you can make North Carolina a more just state but then behave as an individual in ways that are unjust&#8212;It&#8217;s just like, what are you talking about? We have to be what we want to see in the world, and I know it&#8217;s kind of a clich&#233;, but I actually really believe that a lot of the challenges that we have as a movement are because we haven&#8217;t done an assessment of who we are as individuals and how we work and how we treat people and how we make people invisible and all these kinds of things that we do to each other&#8212;and how we feel about ourselves actually is part of that too. I talked about that at breakfast. I feel like all of that is work we have to do. So yeah, you can go out and fix the world, but first you&#8217;ve got to do a self-assessment. And so for me I say that in love. And I try to love myself too. I&#8217;m not fully like completely and totally in love with me yet. But I feel like that&#8217;s part of what I&#8217;m sent here to do and encourage, and that&#8217;s just a mandate from God. I guess I would also say yes, she loved God. And she was really trying to follow the most high&#8217;s will for my life. And I say, sometimes I say he or she because I haven&#8217;t, nobody has proven to me that God is a man even though they look at the Bible. A man wrote that. [laughter] I would say [I was] really a spiritual person, worshipped God, believed in God, believed God commanded us to love, believed we should be loving each other, believed we should love ourselves and believed that Jesus was a revolutionary and that he saw for the least of these. That&#8217;s what we really should all be trying to do, we should all be trying to do that whether you&#8217;re Christian or not. You should be doing that work or you should be thinking about how can I help someone else who needs my help and how can I love everybody and if everybody did that regardless of what your actual faith was, if you practiced the principles, we would be living in a different type of world.   CS:  I know I said I was done, but I just have one more question. You&#8217;re now talking about your faith, and so how has that influenced you to be--?, You mentioned in grad school you and your husband became very radical and you moved down here and got involved in these radical movements. How has your faith--?   EB:  You&#8217;re so cute. You think this work is radical. [Laughing]  CS:  Well, I mean, I don&#8217;t know specifically but that they thought that you were radical as a person not necessarily your work. Not that your work isn&#8217;t radical. You could consider it radical.   EB:  I think some people could. I certainly don&#8217;t.  CS:  I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s North Carolina, some people consider it radical.  EB:  Oh my God.  CS:  But how has your faith--?  EB:  Informed that.  CS:  Informed that.   EB:  Yeah, so I would say how has my faith informed it. I would say that as I study and I struggle with this because I love Jesus, sometimes I worry, I wonder about Christians. I don&#8217;t know about Christians, but I really do love Jesus. He really said a number of times what he was most concerned about was how are you treating the least of these, the widow, the orphan. I follow that. I don&#8217;t even know where it came from. Like my passion for how are we really helping folks. I think part of it also may be my guilt from the kind of life that I grew up in the military, the privilege on some level. It&#8217;s not every other people&#8217;s privilege, but it was a privileged upbringing that I had, and so I think I carry a lot like well, why can&#8217;t everybody have more. This doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me and why should anybody suffer. I just don&#8217;t understand. I don&#8217;t understand. What is wrong with us? Why are we like this? I just don&#8217;t get it. This selfishness is beyond me. So I feel like Jesus called that out, and he did command us to love and he didn&#8217;t say love some people. Love people that look like you. Love, he said love, and we are commanded to do that in my humble opinion. And so for me it shows up in the work that I do, but it also shows up in, &#8220;How am I supposed to treat people?&#8221; Everybody, not just people who agree with me but also people who don&#8217;t agree with me. I don&#8217;t have to, and my mother used to say to me when I was growing up, she&#8217;s like I love you but I don&#8217;t like you. It doesn&#8217;t mean you have to like everything, but certainly there is a level of honoring everybody&#8217;s humanity and seeing that. I think it&#8217;s really hard when people don&#8217;t honor your humanity to do it. So I&#8217;m not arguing that it&#8217;s easy, and I know I&#8217;ve fallen short a number of times but I try. So I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the center of what it is. And then everything kind of flows from there.  CS:  All right. Well, thank you so much for giving me your life history and participating in this.  EB:  Oh my God thank you for taking the time to do it and collect it and I&#8217;ll be sharing it with my sons and my grandkids I hope when I&#8217;m really old.
