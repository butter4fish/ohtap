MEG FOSTER:  Okay. So this is Meg Foster. I&#8217;m interviewing Janet Ward Black on Friday July 25th. Can we start by you telling me a little bit about when and where you were born and grew up?  JANET WARD BLACK:  Sure. My name is Janet Ward Black. Like a good southerner I go by both of my first names Janet Ward rather than Janet. I was born in Kannapolis, North Carolina, in February of 1959. I grew up in Kannapolis, went to school in Cabarrus County, and in fact my mother still lives in the house that she brought me home from the hospital.  MF:  Wow. What did your parents do?  JB:  My mom was a high school English teacher. She actually started out teaching thirty years earlier--Bible at A.L. Brown in Kannapolis--and eventually went to Concord High School and taught senior English and Advanced Placement English. My dad was a depression baby, and he and his brothers started a small chain of drugstores after the depression; it was called Baxter&#8217;s Drugs and Black&#8217;s Drugs in Cabarrus County. He was not a pharmacist, so he was in fact grandfathered in and didn&#8217;t have to have a pharmacy license. He just had to have a pharmacist that worked with him after that law came into effect. And he passed away when I was twenty-one.  MF:  Alright. Do you have any siblings?   JB:  I have a half-brother. My half-brother went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was the chief cheerleader and president of the senior class. He ended up being a military officer in the Army, lieutenant colonel, ran hospitals for the Army, served in Vietnam, and ended up after his career in the Army running hospitals as a civilian. Then he and my sister-in-law ran the only Christian talent agency in Hollywood for a number of years.  MF:  Wow. That&#8217;s awesome. So where did you go to school as an undergrad and what did you study?  JB:  I went to Davidson College. Davidson College is a small college outside of Charlotte and not too terribly far from Kannapolis. I had started out as a chemistry major. The Charles A. Cannon Foundation, which started Cannon Mills --the Cannon family did-- in Kannapolis, which was the center of economic life of Kannapolis, had a scholarship program, and I did pretty well in science in school so they awarded me a scholarship in chemistry. So I went to Davidson as a chemistry major with the intention of being a doctor. Then I hit organic chemistry and changed my mind about that. And the nice people at the Cannon Foundation allowed me to change my major to economics, and that&#8217;s what I ended up [choosing] as my major at Davidson. In addition to the Charles A. Cannon Scholarship, I was a Davidson honors scholar, which is a general scholarship that I was able to enjoy while I was at Davidson as well.   MF:  Great. So what made you want to go to law school?  JB:  You would think that I had some great plan about why I was going to law school, but I didn&#8217;t. It goes back to what I said about my dad, because he was raised in the Depression. He was from Union County, North Carolina, actually a small town called Marshville. There weren&#8217;t any jobs. So when the Depression came along, he and his sisters all moved to Washington, DC to be able to get a job. And he had to start sweeping up in People&#8217;s Drug Store. That&#8217;s where he started working, as a stock boy. So from the time I grew up he always said, &#8220;I want you to have a job where you don&#8217;t have to ask anyone for a job.&#8221; So I always knew I wanted to be a doctor. Doctors didn&#8217;t have to ask people for jobs. And then when I decided to change my major I said, &#8220;Hmm, who else doesn&#8217;t have to ask people for a job? I know, lawyers. I&#8217;ll be a lawyer.&#8221; And it was at that level of intellectual rigor I made the decision to become a lawyer. So it was one of those things where it was not my plan and I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, but it worked out just the way it was supposed to.  MF:  And you went to law school at Duke?  JB:  I did.   MF:  Is that correct? Okay. So in doing some research I also found that you were Miss North Carolina in 1980. So when did you get into beauty pageants and what inspired that?  JB:  Well I was only in beauty pageants a total of thirteen months.   MF:  Oh wow.  JB:  This is an interesting little piece of North Carolina lore actually. Cabarrus County had not had a pageant--where I grew up--had not had a pageant for a number of years. So the gal who was Miss Cabarrus County, whose name was Dakeita Vanderburg, had been Miss Cabarrus County for a number of years because there had not been another. So some folks came and talked to me about whether I wanted to participate, and I had taken piano most of my life and thought, &#8220;Well, what the heck, I&#8217;ll give it a try.&#8221; So I participated in the Miss Cabarrus County pageant in the fall of 1979. So Dakeita was the person who ended up crowning the girl who won, and her name was Candy Cohen. I finished as the first runner up, and then I&#8217;ll come back in a second about the rest of the people who finished in that. But I ended up saying, &#8220;Well, I bet I can learn how to do this better,&#8221; because there was a lot of pageant science that I didn&#8217;t know a whole lot about. I didn&#8217;t know who you&#8217;re supposed to buy dresses from and exactly how you were supposed to respond or act or stand and the like. So I used the next few months to try to do a little bit better. So I ended up participating at Miss Charlotte-Mecklenburg. I won that pageant. That was in January of 1980. My dad passed away in March of 1980. I went to Miss North Carolina and won in June of 1980. Then I participated in Miss America in September of 1980 and won one of the grand talent awards there for my piano performance.   MF:  Wow.  JB:  So from about August of 1979 to September of 1980 was the extent of my pageant experience. And it was wonderful. It was a great experience, but let me tell you a little bit about the people who won, about the Miss Cabarrus contestants in 1980. So you know how I said Dakeita had been the person who was Miss Cabarrus County. So she crowned Candy Cohen. Then I was Candy Cohen&#8217;s first runner up. And then a girl named Lorie Boggs was the most talented non-finalist in that competition for Miss Cabarrus County. Well, ultimately, Candy moved to West Virginia and became Miss West Virginia. Lorie Boggs went on about three years later and competed again at Miss North Carolina and won Miss North Carolina. And then Dakeita went to Connecticut and won Miss Connecticut. So in that little small Miss Cabarrus County pageant there were four women who ended up competing at Miss America.  MF:  That&#8217;s incredible.   JB:  Yeah, and pageants generally--. I know a lot of times people think, &#8220;Oh that&#8217;s not too women&#8217;s lib-ish if you participated in pageants,&#8221; but the Miss America program continues to be the largest scholarship foundation for women in the world. And I had a very expensive education at Davidson [and] Duke, even in the 1970s and 1980s; and with my dad passing away, the scholarship money was very helpful for my education. And then the tremendously wonderful part of it was I spent that entire year--I took school off--and spent the year traveling North Carolina from Murphy to Manteo, going to every festival and parade you can think of, and it was a great way to learn about the state.  MF:  Wow, that sounds really cool. So what was your first job coming out of law school and what were the gender relations like in the office?   JB:  Well, I had a hard time getting a job out of Duke actually. You would think that one wouldn&#8217;t because Duke has a pretty good placement percentage. And I think perhaps the fact that I had been Miss North Carolina stood in the way of that a little bit. And I had at least one law firm that I had done some work for that did not offer me a job, and subsequently one of the wives of one of the lawyers said, &#8220;[The wives] were really glad to hear you didn&#8217;t end up working at the firm.&#8221; I was just na&#239;ve about that sort of comment.   So I was surprised, and I ended up getting a job with a two-person--, two male lawyers in Charlotte, North Carolina. [I] thought when I was in law school that I was positive what I didn&#8217;t want to do, and what I didn&#8217;t want to do was be a trial lawyer. Now the height of irony is I&#8217;ve been a trial lawyer for the last almost thirty years. But I was afraid to speak in public, and in law school at the time, particularly at Duke, it seemed like there was almost, not an intent to embarrass you, but you were stood up in front of a class of 100 people and interrogated by the professors. It was not exactly the most comfortable of things. So I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a contract lawyer. I&#8217;m going to represent movie stars and sports people and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do so I don&#8217;t have to worry about speaking out in public.&#8221; Well, I started doing contract work for that small law firm in Charlotte, and I found out that what I thought I wanted to do when I got out of law school I didn&#8217;t enjoy at all. I didn&#8217;t like worrying about whether there was a comma or a semi-colon on page seven in the second paragraph. That just didn&#8217;t really make my heart sing.   So after about ten months I heard that there was a job open in the district attorney&#8217;s office in Cabarrus and Rowan counties. At that time the court was combined, Cabarrus and Rowan County. Well, I went to talk to the elected district attorney who is the one who is responsible for hiring folks. They had never hired and I quote, &#8220;a girl lawyer before.&#8221; And he interviewed me, and in spite of the fact that I had not taken trial (             ) at Duke or had any litigation skills, he hired me. So I spent about the first two weeks with another assistant district attorney, and then after that I was on my own trying cases. And on a typical day in Rowan or Cabarrus Counties we have 200 cases on the docket.   So I had to learn pretty much on my feet about how to try cases, and I created a notebook where I had every single case that could be in district court, whether it was a speeding case or passing a stopped school bus or trespassing, so that I knew exactly what each of the elements were, and then I would use the highway patrolmen--the North Carolina state highway patrolmen are trained very well about how to testify in court--what&#8217;s important, what&#8217;s admissible, what&#8217;s not. And so I would ask for a highway patrolman to sit with me at counsel table and kick me under the table if I needed to object. Sometimes I would yell, &#8220;Objection!&#8221; to the judge and have no idea what the basis of my objection was. But I just hoped that he would not ask me what the basis was. But I learned on my feet and did that in the DA&#8217;s office for a little less than a year, and then they moved me to superior court. So then I spent about the next three years trying jury trials, everything from passing a stopped school bus to some murder cases. So it was pretty much the gamut. But that was a great way to learn how people respond and how jurors listen to evidence and how they make decisions. So it was a great learning ground. So I was there in my first job--or second job actually--with the DA&#8217;s office about three and a half years.  MF:  Wow. Is there any particular case that stands out in your memory?  JB:  Yeah actually. That&#8217;s a good question. There are two that come to mind. When I was in district court, we would prosecute, like communicating a threat warrant. And a woman came to me who was a beautiful African American woman, heavyset, had two young children, and she was married to a preacher. Her name was Freddie Berthes, and her husband&#8217;s name was Ernest Berthes. They&#8217;d been married for about thirty years. They had separated, and she took a warrant out against him for communicating a threat. Because Reverend Berthes had no criminal record he got what&#8217;s called a PJC, prayer for judgment continued. And the prayer for judgment was, he wouldn&#8217;t have a conviction as long as he didn&#8217;t come around or bother Freddie anymore. Well, Freddie came with the two kids up to the DA&#8217;s office one Friday afternoon and said that the Reverend Berthes had been calling her school where she was a kindergarten teacher. And she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to lose my job if he keeps calling up there,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Are you afraid of him?&#8221; She said, &#8220;No, no. I just want him to stop calling the school.&#8221; So I did the paperwork to bring him back into court. The case was set on one day, and the judge who was there said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not the one who heard the original prayer for judgment continued. I&#8217;m going to put it on the next time that the judge who originally sentenced him is going to be in court.&#8221;   Over that period of weeks the oldest daughter of Reverend and Mrs. Berthes graduated from high school and they, Mrs. Berthes and the two younger kids who were maybe six and eight at the time, drove in a car with the oldest daughter driving to pick up a cake. So they drive up to this store and the daughter that&#8217;s graduating goes out to the house to pick up the cake, and Reverend Berthes had followed behind them and Mrs. Berthes&#8217; window was down. And he came up to the car window and stabbed her to death in front of her two small children. And the quantity of blood was massive. It was seventeen maybe stab wounds. Shortly after that the Reverend Berthes showed up in the Rowan County jail and had a bible in his hands and his hands were still covered in blood. And he said, &#8220;I have sinned,&#8221; and turned himself in. I was about twenty-six or twenty-seven when that happened. And I got a call from the police officers to tell me that she&#8217;d been killed. And I was very upset because I was wondering if I hadn&#8217;t done something quickly enough or had the system let her down or what. And what was shocking to me that when the house was investigated by the detectives, they found Mrs. Berthes&#8217; diary where she talked about how for almost thirty years he had been mentally and physically abusive to her and that she never told anyone because they were prominent in the community. She didn&#8217;t want to get her preacher husband in trouble. So she just put up with it. And one of the quotes was &#8220;I am guilty of being an abused spouse.&#8221;   So that probably heightened my sensitivity for the rest of my days to try to listen to people to make sure that even when they tell you no, if no is not the correct answer that you try to push through that. And then when I talk to younger women now, I tell them often the story of Mrs. Berthes and about how those children ended up orphans. Their mom was dead. Their dad ended up going off to prison for first degree murder, and it&#8217;s tremendously sad that that&#8217;s how that story turned out. But it was in large part because she would never ask for help.  MF:  Wow. That&#8217;s devastating. What was the second case?  JB:  The second one was the one that got me involved in politics and the North Carolina legislature a bit. There was a woman who had been beaten so badly by her husband with his fists that she became brain damaged and was unable to work forever. I believe her last name was Pepper, P-E-P-P-E-R. And there was nothing that was a felony charge that we could charge [him] with. It didn&#8217;t seem to rise to the level of an attempted murder, but everything that was under that at the time was a misdemeanor. So the most that could happen to this gentleman for having eliminated his wife&#8217;s ability to live and function and earn a living was a two-year sentence. So I started a writing campaign and tried to get there to be a felony that was related for just a fist or hand related assault. And I wrote a number of legislators, and Senator Tony Rand became interested in what I had raised. And he had me come to Raleigh and testify at one of the legislative committees. The bill never made it anywhere, but I was, again, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight at that time and I was just shocked to see that you could walk into the North Carolina legislature, and there wasn&#8217;t any security, and you could walk into a senator or house member&#8217;s office and be able to talk to them directly. There might be a secretary in your way, but that otherwise you had this open forum to talk to members of the legislature. So I think that was a good time in my life to learn that you don't have to be scared of what&#8217;s going on in Raleigh. But if you do nothing, good things will not happen and bad things can happen. So I guess ever since then I&#8217;ve continued to go to the North Carolina legislature.  MF:  That&#8217;s awesome. Did you get a lot of support for what you were doing?  JB:  Yes. Yes. And a number of legislators had pushed it subsequently, but we got criticism as well by saying well you should&#8217;ve prosecuted him for attempted murder, and at the time I didn&#8217;t think that was right. The elected DA did not think that that was correct given the particular circumstances, because it wasn&#8217;t that he meant to kill her. He meant to hurt her badly, but he didn&#8217;t mean to do the damage that he was doing. So the choice was either a two-year misdemeanor or potentially him being found guilty of something that was lesser than that. [Coughs] Excuse me.   MF:  So were there any female trailblazers or personal role models that encouraged you to have a career in law?  JB:  I guess I saw members of the U.S. Supreme Court and in North Carolina at the time, particularly from the time I got out of law school in [19]85 through the time I was in the DA&#8217;s office, there were very few female judges. As I mentioned when I was in the DA&#8217;s office, I was the first female assistant that they had. I find that kind of shocking to be able to say in 1985 the DAs office had never had a woman. It&#8217;s not that too terribly long ago in my view. But there were a number of women that I learned good things from and a number of women [from whom] I learned how not to do things. I think that particularly as a woman you have to realize you can&#8217;t operate exactly like a man can. And that if you do you&#8217;re criticized for being an inappropriate lady, at least in the South. And I had to learn a lot from many people about blending the right combination of trades and steeliness and courage and fearlessness to do what I needed to do. But still trying to do it using the feminine skill set that I have as well.   MF:  Okay. So when did you start your own firm and why did you decide to do that?  JB:  Well, much like going to law school, I never meant to start my own firm. I always would have been happy working for somebody else, but we had a law firm here in Greensboro that had a number of cases and we had a lot of activity going on, and I had a partner where he and I had a disagreement about the future of the firm, and I really felt like God was leading me to tell him that we needed to separate, so much like a divorce. We were fifty-fifty partners and that was the direction that we needed to go. What ended up happening was the vast majority of the cases stayed here at the firm in Greensboro and the staff as well. So we went from a fifty-fifty partnership to where he moved away and diminished his practice somewhat, and then I end up sitting at the head of the table going, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got all these employees, now what am I going to do?&#8221; And that was almost ten years ago. So I never had the intention to start my own law firm; it just worked out that way.   What I know now in retrospect is it has been one of the great joys of my life. There is a whole lot to be said for being the monarch of a business. You get to decide how things are shaped and what&#8217;s important, how the culture is going to be in a particular business, and so I think I&#8217;ve been extraordinarily blessed to be able to set the course for the sailing of the ship that is this law firm. And we&#8217;re a work in progress. We&#8217;re always trying to do better, be better, be better community servants, and I think being pushed into the position of being an entrepreneur is one of the best things that&#8217;s ever happened to me.  MF:  Wow. So what would you say the vision of Ward Black Law is, what kind of culture do you try to set?  JB:  We have thirty-five or so employees right now. In our office we have the pictures of our staff and their families in the hall, and we use that to be a reminder not just to the people who come visit that we are humans, that we have actually lives outside of this, but also to remind us who are the decision makers, that the decision that we make for our employees don&#8217;t just affect the employee, they affect the employee&#8217;s family.   We do some pretty nurturing things here. There&#8217;s a wonderful national business that&#8217;s based out of North Carolina called Corporate Chaplains of America. Ward Black Law has a corporate chaplain that comes here every Tuesday and says hi individually to everyone, and then that individual is a resource for our employees and their families and if they are going to the hospital, Pastor Dan shows up. If somebody has had a funeral or a loss in the family, he&#8217;s the first one to show up there. If there&#8217;s someone who has a family member in Florida who&#8217;s in trouble, Corporate Chaplains will help assign a pastor in Florida to go visit that person&#8217;s family member. So that&#8217;s an example of the culture we try to set.   Last year we started on what we think is a pretty revolutionary path for our business. We started pledging ten percent of our gross revenue for good works in the community. We consider it a tithe. We set that ten percent of the gross aside, and then we very strategically try to identify regional, national, global partners that are best in class for what they do to try to make the world a better place. So we sew into the companies [and] the nonprofits that are doing the work to look after those who are less fortunate in the world.  MF:  That&#8217;s great. Wow. Can you tell me a little bit about the 4ALL program that you created and why public service and nonprofit work seems to be really a big part of your life?   JB:  I was had the great honor of being chosen to be president of the North Carolina Bar Association in 2007 and 2008. There is not an election for that. You are chosen by the past presidents, and it is very much like the selection of the pope. We laugh and say there&#8217;s a puff of smoke that comes out of the chimney when the past presidents decide who&#8217;s going to be the one for the next year. There are almost 20,000 members in the North Carolina Bar Association. So to get to be the one is a really remarkable thing.   I went to a conference for the American Bar Association during my year as president-elect. And I heard this profound statement about serving in a presidency role in a nonprofit. The man said, &#8220;Your term will begin six months before you think it does and it&#8217;ll end six months before you think it does.&#8221; Meaning that if you don&#8217;t have what you plan to do in place a half a year before your presidency starts, then you&#8217;ll also miss the fact that they&#8217;ll be focusing on the next president-elect six months before your term ends. So I took that very seriously and tried to identify what I thought would be something that would have a lasting impact. And that&#8217;s hard to do with lawyers.   One of the great sadnesses in my life is the recognition that about one-third of North Carolinians cannot afford a lawyer to help them do anything. On the criminal side there are constitutional rights for someone to be appointed a lawyer if their crime reaches a certain level and they can&#8217;t afford it. But that&#8217;s not true over family law issues like divorce and child support and child custody. It&#8217;s not true when the landlord won&#8217;t fix the property that you have but you&#8217;re paying the rent and paying a deposit. When people need help to get Medicaid benefits there are not lawyers that are providing those services to people who can&#8217;t afford them. So you had created in North Carolina--, the predominant entity is Legal Aid of North Carolina, which provides free legal services to the poor on the civil side of cases in all 100 counties.   What has happened to lawyers though, over time, is much like what&#8217;s happened to doctors. We&#8217;ve become very specialized. If you go to a doctor, it&#8217;s very hard to find a general practitioner anymore. If you&#8217;ve got something wrong with your head, you go to a neurologist. If you&#8217;ve got something wrong with your feet, you go to a podiatrist. And lawyers are like that now. It&#8217;s so hard to keep up with how quickly law is changing in so many different areas. The easiest thing is to find one area of law and stick with that so that you can conquer the knowledge that&#8217;s required there. So what that means is that there are a whole lot of lawyers in North Carolina out of that 20,000 that have never handled any of the kinds of cases that I&#8217;m just now mentioning. So you put the burden on an entity like Legal Aid that has only 150 lawyers in the entire state of North Carolina trying to cover 100 counties and almost three million people. And then every time the federal government looks at their budget or the North Carolina legislature looks at their budget commitments and things are tight, it&#8217;s Legal Aid&#8217;s budget that will often be on the chopping block. So they have progressively less and less support from a governmental standpoint and are depending more and more on, as Vivien Leigh would say, the kindness of strangers in A Streetcar Named Desire.   So what we tried to do in the 4ALL program was to do about four things. One was to help people who--. Particularly in [20]07, in the 2000s, lawyers were taking it on the chin with a lot of politically generated negative publicity. It was a great idea to say how rotten lawyers were and how they were ruining the world. So we knew that from some polling information that we had received that had been done by the Georgia state bar that people still, even if they didn&#8217;t like lawyers, believed in the concept of liberty and justice for all. So the name we got for the program is the end of that pledge of allegiance, and we decided well, let&#8217;s make it a little edgy, so we&#8217;ll use the number four and capital A-L-L to bring people back to, &#8220;That&#8217;s what lawyers do.&#8221; Lawyers are the ones who are trying to say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what the law is and let&#8217;s comply with it. Let&#8217;s make others comply with it to be the police of the law in the United States.&#8221;   So part of what we wanted to do was improve the image of the profession. But that was only a slight component of all of this. What we knew that was important was, how you get lawyers, these highly specialized people now, to want to learn how to do a landlord tenant case or a child custody dispute. And lawyers have--, now it&#8217;s like doctors as well, there&#8217;s so much pressure on what you have to do to be able to keep your doors open. You think about, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not sure I want to volunteer to take this case that&#8217;s going to take 200 hours that I&#8217;m going to do for free, and I don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s going to end.&#8221;  So we thought well, let&#8217;s find something that&#8217;s a circumscribed day [for] all the fears that lawyers have: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get too involved; I don&#8217;t want this to be a tremendous drain on the time that I&#8217;ve committed to other people; I don&#8217;t know how to answer the questions.&#8221; What we did was we created an &#8220;ask a lawyer&#8221; day where we created this spectacular manual that tells lawyers how to answer the questions on virtually any of the main topics that people would call about. We set that for April of 2008 and more than 1,000 lawyers volunteered to answer the phones on that day. Major media, major TV stations in every single market, I believe, except maybe one, provided us a call center and television coverage and did it from six o&#8217;clock in the morning until six o&#8217;clock at night; we answered the phone for whoever called. And it didn&#8217;t matter whether they were poor or rich. We didn&#8217;t ask them their name. The lawyer didn&#8217;t identify their name. They would just say, &#8220;Hi I&#8217;m a volunteer lawyer for the North Carolina Bar Association. What&#8217;s your legal question?&#8217; And then the person could ask their question and they could talk as long as they wanted to.   And what was stunning to us the first day--. We had a lawyer from here in Greensboro who only does banking law. And he was like, &#8220;Well, if any banks call here I&#8217;ll be happy to handle the question.&#8221; And he started answering the phone and realizing that even though he was so very specialized, a lot of the questions people had were things that he really did know or he could use his manual to find out. But one of his other partners was on the phone at the--we had a bank of like twenty phones in Greensboro with lawyers manning them and phones ringing off the hook--and he&#8217;s trying to figure out why his female partner is so long on the phone. Well, come to find out, a doctor had called in and was going to sell his practice, and he was asking her questions about multi-million transaction. And it was such a surprise that some doctor would feel comfortable enough to call an anonymous hotline to be able to find the answers to some of his questions.   So one of the big components of the 4ALL program was that ask a lawyer day. And then the other parts were to try to educate lawyers about the huge number of people, that three million in North Carolina that needed lawyers, and to let the call 4ALL day be the first step to say, &#8220;Look you really can do this. You only had to do it two or three hours this one day, but maybe you could take a case.&#8221; So there have been some programs that have been created subsequently by the bar association to let lawyers talk to people for free any time they want to, but only for an hour, not agreeing to quote, &#8220;take the case,&#8221; but just to counsel somebody at no charge. And that&#8217;s been an offshoot of the 4ALL program. They&#8217;re now calling that lawyer on the line.   It&#8217;s been at this point seven years since we started the &#8220;ask a lawyer&#8221; day and it has continued every year. And we have answered somewhere between seven and almost ten thousand calls on each of those days. I used to know what the running tally was, but I think it&#8217;s safely over thirty-five thousand North Carolinians. It&#8217;s probably a good ways north of fifty thousand would be my estimate. So we had some good press about that. The ABA gave us an award for that program. And Tennessee subsequently copied the program. They&#8217;re in the process in Alabama now of copying the program, and then a couple of provinces in Canada also picked it up.   So it was a really rewarding thing to realize that there were ways to get lawyers to do what they didn&#8217;t want to do, which was to answer questions that they didn&#8217;t think they knew the answer to because it wasn&#8217;t their area of expertise. But the most rewarding thing was on that day of call 4ALL they actually had ways for me to get to all of the TV stations and one of the corporate sponsors had even volunteered a plane, so I was able to fly from Asheville to Wilmington so that we could do a really good kick off of the day. But what I was so surprised at [was] every time a lawyer left from his shift--or she--they said, &#8220;That was great. That&#8217;s why I wanted to be a lawyer. I love getting to answer people&#8217;s questions.&#8221; And even to this day I study the manual the day before 4ALL day because I&#8217;m still like, &#8220;Oh I don&#8217;t know enough to be able to answer these people&#8217;s questions.&#8221; And I&#8217;m anxious about it, and I know that if I&#8217;m that way all those hundreds of other lawyers that are going are doing the same thing. But if they can press through and come out to the end, they realize just how they are able to add value to some folks who often times can&#8217;t pay somebody&#8217;s retainer or just because of a function of the way their life is, don&#8217;t know any lawyers. They don&#8217;t see somebody at church or at business or at work who is lawyer and they&#8217;re afraid. So they look for sources or other people who they think are smarter than they are and oftentimes get bad advice. So one person said about 4ALL day--when people said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to know how to answer any of these questions&#8221;--they said, &#8220;But you as a lawyer are always going to know more about how to analyze the question than the caller is because they&#8217;re not a lawyer.&#8221; And that was a great way to break the ice for some people.   MF:  Yeah. That sounds like a win-win for callers and lawyers.   JB:  Yes. Yes.  MF:  Can you tell me about how religion has influenced your life and your professional work?  JB:  Sure. Let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;m very much a work in progress. To be forthcoming about the split of the law firm, I really felt like God wanted me to separate from my partner at that time. He was a fine man. This is not criticism of him at all. But I think that God was looking to do something different with this law firm that would never have happened if I had stayed connected to my partner at the time. And what was remarkable, in something that I thought was going to be the financial ruin of me and the firm because of the burden that was on us over the cases and being able to pay the salaries of people. I worked for a number of years where I didn&#8217;t take a salary. But no person who worked here ever missed a check. That was what was important to me, and the fact that we&#8217;re still standing here now almost ten years later is quite the miracle, but short within a matter of six months after I got the connection, actually less than that, of when a representative of the past presidents came and said we want you to be president-elect of the North Carolina Bar Association, that was within about two months of the firm having split up. So I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Wow, isn&#8217;t that interesting?&#8221; I think God&#8217;s doing my marketing because all of a sudden rather than--. They say that if you change the name of a business that it&#8217;s almost like starting over. So we were having to go from a name that had been established in Greensboro for fifteen years. We&#8217;d done a lot of marketing. People knew the name. And all of a sudden it had to be completely different than what it was before. So I knew we were starting from scratch about trying to build a brand. So for me to get the sort of recognition that I was able to enjoy and the connections I was able to meet through being president of the bar association was remarkable timing. The more that we have served the downtrodden--. What we do here is primarily represent people who are injured or disabled, and that representation of that over time has solidified and shown to me how, at least for my Christian faith, the Bible is replete with references of looking after the poor and the jailed and the hungry and the thirsty and the strangers, the widowed, the orphaned. When I felt that God was leading us last year to commit ten percent of our gross revenue, we didn&#8217;t have ten percent profit margin. So it was a mathematical impossibility for us to be able to pull it off, and somehow we were blessed in such a way that not only did we give ten percent of our gross revenue last year; we gave the highest bonuses to every single staff person we&#8217;d ever given and we had money left over. So for me personally it&#8217;s God&#8217;s math. If you do something that he says to do, even though it seems impossible, he can make it turn out that way. And what has been interesting about our commitment, we call it either the Ward Black Law tenth or the Ward Black Law tithe, [is that] we have a small committee that goes out researches this best in class sets of nonprofits and tries--. We intentionally--, and in fact we have spreadsheets and graphs where we graphed hungry, thirsty, jailed, sick, orphaned, strangers, widows and we look for entities to fill those holes.   And we are really seeing how government is not going to be able to solve what&#8217;s wrong in the United States. The reason in my view why there is a split between Democrats and Republicans frankly has to do with provision to the poor, because if you did not have to talk about Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, there&#8217;d be more than enough money to be able to build whatever infrastructure that we needed in the United States. The way the Democrats are solving it is, their theory is government pays for it. The Republicans&#8217; theory is the government should not pay for it. And therein lies the great divide.   Well, I hope part of what the rest of my life will be is trying to encourage business owners to say government can&#8217;t do it. This is what&#8217;s causing the violence in our political system now, the great split. So what if every business owner donated ten percent of their gross revenue? How much money would that be and could we not serve all of these people groups and float everybody&#8217;s boat higher? And isn&#8217;t that what we want, to really have a thriving community, a country that is healthy? You can&#8217;t have it be forty percent poor people and ten percent super rich and then a middle class. If you want that country to be the best, most enjoyable possible place to live in, you would want everybody to be doing okay.   So I think for us, part of the solution, at least for our little microcosm of the world, is this ten percent gross revenue plan. I have a good connection of other Christian business people, and a number of them--. We are having good conversations and people are making small strides in that direction in this little part of Greensboro, North Carolina, and there certainly incredible corporations that are great philanthropic partners, but what we do and why it&#8217;s a little different is we require the nonprofits to maintain our anonymity. We do not allow them to say that we&#8217;ve donated a dime. We don&#8217;t let them put our name on a plaque anywhere. We don&#8217;t let them put our names out in a newsletter. We want to make sure that there is purity in what we&#8217;re doing with the ten percent. We have a marketing budget. We spend money for marketing in this law firm. We pay for television commercials. We pay for billboards. But that&#8217;s not what this is. And we&#8217;re trying to keep it very segmented in our own minds so that we&#8217;re doing it for the right reason: that we&#8217;re not doing it for our own glory but we&#8217;re doing it for God&#8217;s glory.   MF:  Do you think that&#8217;s it been catching on at all?  JB:  Yes.  MF:  In your community?  JB:  Yes, I think it is so surprising to people that when--. We have no problem telling people that we tithe. The restrictions are on the amounts and people using us for things that we think would be helping our reputation, and that&#8217;s really not what we&#8217;re looking for. But the thing that&#8217;s shocked me the most recently was we had somebody come in to do a culture survey of the staff, and they judged things on internal communications and are your skill sets being best used and things that are very practical, but the last question is, do you think that the work that your business is doing is having a real impact in your community or the world? And we got perfect grades by all of our staff on that. And I don&#8217;t think two years ago we would have. That even though we represent hurt people for a living--we have a heart to help people--I think the tithe has really made the seminal difference in the culture here, because now I in part work because I want to give away more money, that it has changed my thinking.   And there are some amazing businesses, and I haven&#8217;t been this brave yet, where the owners of the business say, &#8220;Look I&#8217;m going to take a certain salary, and I don&#8217;t care how much money we make I&#8217;m never going to take any more than that.&#8221; And that you struggle as a business owner at certain levels to say, &#8220;How much is enough? And how much is silly? How many more vacation houses do you need? Do you really need a new car every year? How big does the bank account need to be when you have people working for you who are never going to be in that level?&#8221; And for us we want the staff to be proud of what we are doing here and they have become that way. It&#8217;s interesting to me that something that I didn&#8217;t expect a hundred percent buy in on has been a hundred percent buy in.   One of the ways that we reveal to them how we had invested the money last year was for our annual Christmas party we rented a bus, and we then took a police officer from Greensboro who got on the bus and explained to the staff what poverty really means in Guilford County, what he sees about the homeless and homeless children and people living under bridges and not able to get medical care, not able to eat. We then stopped at every nonprofit in Guilford County that we support, whether they were providing shelter for individuals or providing food or help to AIDS victims. That allowed our staff, many of whom didn&#8217;t understand the full extent of the problem in our county, to be able to see tangibly how people are making a difference and how huge the problem is.   The one thing that blew the staff away was we went to one of the shelters here, and the question was, &#8220;Why is there just men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s? Where do the kids go?&#8221; They were told you can&#8217;t have children in an adult shelter because a lot of times you don&#8217;t know what the criminal background is of the people who are involved and there are real safety issues. Well, what we learned was there was no at the time shelter that would take a homeless parent with children. Well, so that meant that you have the predominant number of those folks had no place to go. So they&#8217;re either couch surfing or they&#8217;re living in a car or they&#8217;re living in a tent in one of the tent villages here. And when the staff were told that according to the Guilford County School System records for 2013-2014 there were 2,000 homeless children in our little county, 2,000&#8230; that shocked our people so much. And then we also started putting together that there&#8217;s really not good facilities for them now. So we are actively looking. We are saying, &#8220;Who&#8217;s got the solution to this and then can we help, can we help sew into that activity?&#8221; Because that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s real and tangible and makes a difference. There was a nonprofit in that operated here for a long time, and then had some financial trouble that and so it stopped for a while, but it&#8217;s coming back and it&#8217;s going to provide the first shelter for homeless women and their children. But it only is going to be able to house about thirty-two at a time. So what happens to the other 1,968 of them? What happens tonight? What happens tomorrow night? What happens when it&#8217;s 102 degrees and what happens when it&#8217;s seventeen degrees and it&#8217;s snowing? What happens to these people now? Those thing were questions for us that were burdensome, and if you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s out there in the community, you really don&#8217;t know how you can make a difference.   BF:  Yeah, that&#8217;s true. So you&#8217;re also a motivational speaker, is that correct?  JB:  Um hmm.  BF:  What do you talk about and who is usually your audience?  JB:  Good. I actually have been [laughs] the Girls State speaker on law as a career for women and the judiciary for twenty-five years in a row and I missed one. So I&#8217;ve been doing it for twenty-four years. And I tell stories much like you and I have talked about today, the Freddie Berthes story. I use some extraordinarily graphic photographs about the death of a woman from a drunk driver to explain about cars. I think when you&#8217;re sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years old like the girls at Girls State--all of whom who&#8217;ve been identified as leaders in their high schools, 350 high schools, each year--you think you&#8217;re not going to ever die. So I use pictures and I tell them, &#8220;I know I&#8217;m speaking right before lunch and you may want to turn your head away, but I&#8217;m going to show you some pictures,&#8221; and then I tell them the story of Rob Moroso.   Rob Moroso was NASCAR rookie of the year in must&#8217;ve been about 1982 or so. He was twenty-one years at the time, extraordinarily handsome. At the time Oldsmobile had a slogan. It was the new generation of Oldsmobile. He was driving Oldsmobile for NASCAR, and Oldsmobile provided him a brand new Oldsmobile to drive out in public every thirty days. He had a bright red Oldsmobile at the end of a race in North Wilkesboro. He and some of the other drivers and crew people ended up going to a bar in Mooresville, North Carolina, where the table at which Rob Moroso sat consumed fifty-six mixed drinks over about a two or three hour time frame. When the NASCAR racers race, they lose a lot of body fluids. So they&#8217;re already in a dehydrated state. Well Rob Moroso didn&#8217;t start driving the Oldsmobile when they left Woody&#8217;s, the bar, in Mooresville. His girlfriend was driving. But at some point shortly thereafter they switched and Rob started driving. And he was on 150 heading back to his house in Mooresville and came around a corner sideways [at] about a speed that was estimated in excess of ninety miles an hour. From the other direction was coming a Hospice nurse, twenty-seven year old Tammy Williams. Miss Williams had two small children. She was driving her Toyota Celica. She was in her lane. She was doing the speed limit, and she didn&#8217;t expect a bright red Oldsmobile to come over ninety miles an hour sideways and hit her car in her lane of travel.  The accident was called what they refer to as a t-bone accident, meaning the front of her car hit the driver&#8217;s door of Rob Moroso&#8217;s car. Moroso&#8217;s head hit the pillar, the metal, what they call the pole in between the driver&#8217;s window and the front windshield. It hit it so hard that his head almost exploded and threw him into the back passenger seat, the force was so great. So I show them a picture of Rob Moroso on the passenger seat, dead with his eyes open. I show them a picture of Tammy Williams sitting straight up in her car seat, still with her seatbelt on her, a little bit of blood coming out of her mouth and her eyes open as well. And I explain to them about when people are hit in a car wreck like that where somebody&#8217;s going fifty-five miles an hour one way, and you have something coming at the other direction in at least that kind of speed, what happens at the intersection when you have your body going fifty-five miles an hour, and all of a sudden you ostensibly hit a concrete wall by the fact that this vehicle is coming the other way. It does something often called transaction of the thoracic aorta, and what that means is your aorta and your heart are tethered together. But when you&#8217;re going that fast and all of a sudden you stop, that tethering is not strong, and so your aorta and your heart separate, but your heart is still pumping blood. So the blood ends up spilling into your abdominal cavity and usually die in a relatively short order: fifteen, twenty, thirty seconds perhaps. And I want them to understand that the ramifications of drunk driving are substantial. On blood alcohol at autopsy, Rob Moroso had a point two-two. Right now point zero-eight is the level above which you&#8217;re considered intoxicated in North Carolina. He was almost three times that at twenty-one years of age. In the lawsuit that was involved, we took the testimony called taking a deposition of friends of his who said, &#8220;Oh yeah, he usually, he could drink six or eight beers and you couldn&#8217;t tell that he&#8217;d had a thing.&#8221; So when the issue was, did the bar serve him too much alcohol, his friends were saying, &#8220;Oh no he could drink lots and nobody could tell that he had consumed that much.&#8221;   Well, the moral of the story is he, this incredibly handsome young man with the world by the tail at age twenty-one, is just as dead as he can be. And Tammy Williams&#8217; children grew up without a mother, and she was doing nothing except the speed limit in her own lane on the highway where she was supposed to be. She had a zero-zero blood alcohol, but she&#8217;s just as dead as Rob Moroso.  MF:  Umm.  JB:  So but let me add another point.   MF:  Okay.  JB:  So I scare them to death as part of what I do in my speeches and just because I do want it to have it be visual enough that they don&#8217;t forget about it. But then I talk a lot about the disparity in wages for women, and I talk about--and have interestingly because of the PowerPoints that I&#8217;ve done over the years--I&#8217;ve charted how the percentage a woman earns versus a man has changed over those twenty-five years. We haven&#8217;t made a whole lot of difference, frankly. That number has gone up and gone down every once in a while. But people make assumptions that the differential between women getting paid seventy-seven cents on the dollar for a man or eighty cents or the like. There are a lot of excuses that are in there about saying, &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re just taking these low paying service jobs and women are usually working in more of the minimum wages industry than men are.&#8221; But there&#8217;s also data that shows that differential holds true irrespective of the educational level of the person involved. So women doctors are making a dramatically less rate per hour than men doctors are. What possible reason could there be in that?   So I help them and I show how important it is to go to college. That if you just have a high school education, the differential in your wage rate for the rest of your life is massive. So that&#8217;s important. Then I show them the differences between the men and the women&#8217;s rates so that they can understand that as well. Then we also break it down by ethnicity, and we show that in fact Asian women in North Carolina on average earn more money than white women do, than Caucasian women do. And then African American women earn less than that, than white women or Asian women, and Hispanic women earn less than that. So that you have if your--, you have strikes against you and that you need--, whether you are a woman or you have a non-Caucasian background even though those populations are growing greatly, the differential is still there. So what is the perception that Asian women would make more money than Caucasian women? What is it about the way we process information that has caused that to happen? Is it just true that they all have higher IQs? Well, then why is there still a differential if a PhD female is judged against a PhD male or an Asian woman is judged against a PhD Asian male? Why is that differential still there? So I think until we start looking and recognizing those differentials, you don&#8217;t ever appreciate it. But I can tell you I&#8217;ve had to have the discussion in my head when we&#8217;ve hired people of, &#8220;Oh well he&#8217;s a guy and she&#8217;s a woman. Her husband is probably making a wage.&#8221; I shouldn&#8217;t be considering that at all in what I am paying my people, but it is very hard; no matter how independent somebody tries to be, we have discrimination that we participate in intentionally or unintentionally no matter how hard we try to do right by people. So I think that&#8217;s a really important factor.   Then the other thing that I teach these young women, and this to me is so one, fascinating and two, important. For the last ten years the number of women in college versus the number of men in the United States has been V-ing off such that there are more than three million women in college right now than men. So there are about ten million men in college in the United States, and my facts are not exactly right but they&#8217;re close enough for the example. Ten million men right now in the United States in college and thirteen million women. Well, the differential between those two numbers is growing. So think about what that means over the next ten or twenty years if that continues, and there&#8217;s no reason to think that it will not continue. This differential really started about 1990 where there was no longer an even number of people in college. The women started taking, going ahead. Now I of course try to make a joke with the girls and I say, &#8220;Now this means that the minute you get to college you need to go find you a guy because there are not many to pick from.&#8221; That may be the practical application of it. But the women are by definition are going to have to start taking over the positions because you&#8217;re going to have, what? Thirty million more women in the country with a college education than men every ten years even if it just stays steady?   We see now about how few women are in the U.S. Senate, how few women are in the United States house, how those Fortune 500 companies--. There still are a paltry number of women who are at the leadership of those countries, companies. So how can--, why is that? If there&#8217;s real equality, why is it that you still have ninety-five percent of the Fortune 100 being run by men? And how is that going to change over the next ten or twenty years and can we be ready for it?   Then my other favorite thing as a southern woman to tell these young ladies is this: there are studies out there that [report] one of the main reasons why young women when they get out of college make less money than young men do is because women will not negotiate their starting salaries. And men do it innately and are not offended by saying, &#8220;Well, can&#8217;t you pay me fifteen dollars an hour?&#8221; or, &#8220;Well, what about insurance, health insurance?&#8221; Whereas as southern women sometimes we go thank you very much I&#8217;ll be here tomorrow morning at eight. We don&#8217;t think about pushing back in any way because we&#8217;re afraid of a couple of things. I think we&#8217;re afraid that somebody&#8217;s going to tell us no and that that&#8217;s going to affect our self-worth. &#8220;Oh well, I asked for fifteen and he told me I wasn&#8217;t worth it. I&#8217;m not worth risking that emotion, suffering that emotion.&#8221; And then I think women have a tendency to receive rather than give back, that we don&#8217;t think that we are--, that we should have the right to negotiate for ourselves.   And I&#8217;ve read recently some really interesting studies that show that women politicians&#8230; oftentimes there aren&#8217;t many because they don&#8217;t want to have to go raise the money. They don&#8217;t want to go say, &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Kay Hagan and I need you to write me a check for five thousand dollars because I&#8217;m so great.&#8221; That&#8217;s really what we&#8217;ve--, the political system in the United States has pushed the fundraising side of it so hard and so high and with women having this natural tendency to not want to negotiate for their own worth. But these studies are showing that women are just as effective as men in negotiations as lawyers, for example, if they are negotiating for a third party. So if I have a mediation here at the office, and I&#8217;m mediating for my client who was killed in a tractor trailer accident or a man was, I&#8217;m able to muster what is necessary for me to--with equivalency--mediate, negotiate, argue for my client aggressively. But if it was me saying, &#8220;I got hurt in a car wreck, will you pay me?&#8221; then all of a sudden I have the struggle.   So one of the suggestions in one of the ADA publications now is that women lawyers when they go to negotiate their own salary in partnership tracks and the like, that they intentionally visualize the other people they are affecting. Go in there and negotiate as if it&#8217;s your kids or that your dog, whatever your family looks like. Don&#8217;t think about it being just you. Try to pull in that ability to negotiate for third parties when you go to try to negotiate for yourself.   So I just try to encourage young women to say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s one of the stats and it&#8217;s substantial, that less than thirty percent of women negotiate their starting salary. There&#8217;s no reason that--, all they&#8217;re going to do is tell you no, and frankly you might make the way of the executive track because you had--even if they tell you no the first time--that you had the guts to ask for it, they may see leadership potential in you down the road. So maybe sometimes you&#8217;ve got to risk the no.&#8221;  MF:  That&#8217;s interesting. That&#8217;s helpful for me. [Laughs] I think that&#8217;s all my questions. Is there anything that I&#8217;ve left out that you would like to talk about?  JB:  I think you&#8217;ve done a splendid job. [Laughs]  MF:  Okay, great.
