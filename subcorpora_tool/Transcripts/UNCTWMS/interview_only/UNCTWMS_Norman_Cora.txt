Jessica Wilkerson: This is June 6, 2009, and I&#8217;m at the Southern Association for Women Historians conference, and I&#8217;m interviewing Dr. Cora Norman. [Break in recording] Okay, Cora, I thought I would start by asking you when did you first learn about women&#8217;s rights and feminism?
Cora Norman: It was a gradual thing, I guess, because I didn&#8217;t call myself a feminist for years; then I realized I had been doing feminist activities.  The first thing that hit me, I was in medical school and dreaming of becoming a doctor.  It was my first semester and just before the finals I took pneumonia so I missed my finals.  I was one of the first patients who got antibiotic for pneumonia.  I went back after the holidays and found out--.  Now I came from a family that loved me dearly but there was no money in the family, and I had shared this room with another female in the medical school and she had moved out, leaving me with the room.  That meant more money, and makeup exams, and by this time my husband-to-be had fallen in love with me and he took me back to Little Rock for the spring semester and kept insisting, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get married.  Don&#8217;t go to med school.&#8221;  Well, as I&#8217;ve said many times, hormones took over and I had to check out.
So I had an exit interview with the dean, and the dean told me that day during that exit interview that I had taken the place of a male student that would have gone on--I don&#8217;t know how he knew this--that would have gone on and become a doctor, and then I drop out.  I never forgot that, and years later I realized how anti-female he had been, because they had a history of some of their early students dropping out, males.
Then when we came here--.  Well then we moved as soon as we married.  My husband got a job at what is now the University of Texas at El Paso and I went back--because I only had my AB degree when to med school--so I started back to get my degree in chemistry, and all my fellow students were World War II vets that had come back and started to school.  I remember one day one of them asked, &#8220;Are you planning to raise your baby in the laboratory?&#8221;  Well, I wasn&#8217;t even pregnant at the time, I don&#8217;t think.  But those things hit me, when I look back, should not have been questions aimed at a female.  Then when we moved from Austin, Texas here I wanted my name on the bank account, our mutual bank account.  The bank didn&#8217;t want--.  They said, &#8220;It&#8217;s too much trouble.  You go by Mrs. W.H.&#8221;  Well my husband finally had to intervene to get my name, Cora, on our bank account, and I realized years later that most women wouldn&#8217;t have fought that fight.
And then it wasn&#8217;t until I--.  I really got involved in the feminist movement in Mississippi.  I had a mentor, Lucy Howarth.  Her mother had been Nellie Nugent Somerville, the first women elected to the Mississippi legislature, and Lucy, her daughter, had spent most of her adult life in the Washington area and she spoke as a feminist, and she spoke one day to a group at the White House when Roosevelt was there, and she said--and I read these and I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be a feminist&#8221;--she said, &#8220;I glory in being a feminist.&#8221;  I think when I read that, much, much later in Mississippi, it gave a lot of us in Mississippi the courage to say, &#8220;I am a feminist.&#8221;
So I started--.  I was always interested in feminist activities, I guess, but we weren&#8217;t organized in those days to do what we later did.
JW: So what did the word, &#8220;feminism,&#8221; or what did it mean to be a feminist?
CN: Well I think in my day it meant--.  Unfortunately it meant anti-male.  You hate males.  Well by this time I&#8217;m a grandmother.  I had a son, and most of my friends had sons or grandsons, and we weren&#8217;t trying to hurt them, and we loved husbands, but especially to a lot of--.  Even women of my day thought if I call myself a feminist it means I&#8217;m anti-male.
JW: But when your mentor used the word, &#8220;feminist,&#8221; she meant something different?
CN: She gave me legitimacy as a human being, as a citizen with some brains, that I could use the word, &#8220;feminist,&#8221; also.  But, you know, in I think it was the early 1960s, I had a grant from the American Association of University Women to apply toward my work for a master&#8217;s degree in chemistry, and it was money that the AAUW had gotten--.  Marie Curie, she had gotten a lot of money, and died before she spent that money on her own research.  Somehow or another the courts in New York gave what was left to the American Association of University Women.  I hope I have this story right.  It&#8217;s been years since I&#8217;ve quoted it.  They provided fellowships for women in only the southeastern United States to go back to graduate work.  They had to have an AB degree, they had to be out of school for fifteen years, and the real test was we want to know if you&#8217;re going to have brains enough to do graduate work.  Then there was this theory too that if a woman was educated she&#8217;d go crazy.  Her brain couldn&#8217;t take it, so.
JW: So how did you come to be involved in the Civil Rights Movement?
CN: Well that was really--.  I got involved there before I got involved in organized women&#8217;s activities.  When we moved to Oxford, Mississippi, a year before Meredith came, and we had been--.  I&#8217;m from Arkansas, my husband was from Texas, and we had talked among ourselves that integration was the way to go, but we didn&#8217;t share those thoughts.  Our closest friends had no idea that we were integrationists.  Shortly after Meredith came, and we had just organized the League of Women Voters in Oxford, had a number of women from Oxford and a number from the University, and the Oxford women just pulled out, left the University women still a member of the League of Women Voters.  And then, why, public schools were at stake because of integration, and I worked on that, to keep public schools open.  But then we had to finally announce we were integrationists and that brought our group down to a very small number, which made us very close.  Being a Southerner I never questioned it, my family never questioned it, and as I look back now there were always black people, Negroes, around our house.  My father had a very close friend, [T-Bo], but we never questioned the fact that they had a role to play [and] we had a role to play.  Although we had black women in our home, I had never eaten with a black until I got involved in civil rights.
Now some of my closest friends are black, and I realize through sensitivity training--because my family never real questioned it either; we just accepted the situation--that, well just it was not the thing to do if we called ourselves Christians, number one.  I think that really got to me.  Then we found--I did--that of all the organizations in Mississippi that our churches were some of the last to integrate, and even now out in the rural communities our churches are--.  You don&#8217;t find blacks in white churches or vice versa.  You do in Jackson, Mississippi and the larger towns, but very few.
JW: You said your group became smaller as you let people know that you were integrationists.  Do you mean the League of Women Voters?
CN: No.  The League of Women Voters, that group that stayed together, we were fine, because the Jackson [sic] women had already pulled out, the ones from the city.  But Southern people--it was like my family.  In fact I&#8217;ve written this in my book, how I didn&#8217;t want to tell my mother and daddy that my daughter had opted to room with a black student at Rhodes College.  Daddy was on the deathbed in Texarkana and Judy was already at Rhodes, and I was talking to Daddy and he was asking about his granddaughter and I said, &#8220;Daddy, she has a black roommate.&#8221;  I thought, &#8220;He&#8217;s going to explode in his bed.&#8221;  Nothing was said, very quiet, and then for three or four minutes, and finally he said, &#8220;Times are changing.&#8221;  [That&#8217;s the way he accepted it.]  Daddy died on that trip and after the funeral Mother went back to Mississippi with me.  I still had not told my mother, and we stopped in Memphis to visit her granddaughter, my daughter, and as we pulled up into the parking lot I said, &#8220;Mother, I must tell you, she has a black roommate.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know if I told her then or not.  Anyway, we went on in and here&#8217;s this black guy sitting on the bed, and her roommate&#8217;s there, and I [introduced them.]  We got back in the car and mother simply said, &#8220;Now why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221; and that was all that was said.
Then she came, became--because she spent a lot of time with me and I started working with the Mississippi Humanities Council, and that&#8217;s when I really got into civil rights.  With federal money a program had to be open to all citizens, and the only thing that we had integrated at that time were our schools, and the last person who wanted to do a program at night was the superintendent.  He was--most of them were males--he wanted to be rid of everything. [Laughs] I never shall forget.  I worked to get an invitation to the state superintendents&#8217; meeting.  They were on the Gulf coast meeting, and they did invite me, and I went down to tell them about this new program where they could get money to do a humanities program to discuss public policy issue, and our theme was around education--we had a lot of issues in education--and they&#8217;d have to use professors from the humanities to discuss it.  We could not have a program that was pro or con.  The professor would give the historical background of the issue.  After I spoke, those guys fell out of that room.  Not one of them came [by.]  My mother was with me.  She was not at all involved in academicians&#8217; activities but she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s no way to treat my daughter.&#8221;
Then when she went back to her home in Arkansas, a little town, Waldo, her neighbors were a black couple, and I learned very shortly she took them out for dinner one night at a local restaurant, unheard of in that town, so she became also a worker and they became her fast friends.  So we were just brought up to accept things as they were and you didn&#8217;t question them.
JW: That&#8217;s interesting that you were brought up not to question it but then you did.  What do you think--?
CN: That took--.  When I questioned it we were already at the University of Mississippi and a woman who was dean of women when we went there and then went over to the school of education to teach, she promoted some sensitivity training--. [Knocking] Excuse me. [Break in recording] Anyway, this women, my mentor, she became a very close friend and traveling companion, [Dr. Catherine Ray].  She was an integrationist and provided some sensitivity training for those of us on the campus, like myself, that were Southerners, and she really introduced me to several people that came in to speak to this group, and that&#8217;s where I learned how stupid we&#8217;d been, just plain stupid.
JW: What sorts of activities did you do with her?
CN: Well they were all women&#8217;s issues.  I went with her to--.  I never shall forget.  She was from Meridian, Mississippi, but then she taught her first school at Gulfport High School as counselor there, and she had a good friend who taught school and she wanted her to come back and work on her master&#8217;s.  The woman was middle aged, I guess, so Catherine convinced her that she would drive from Oxford, Mississippi, over two hundred miles to the Gulf Coast, and drive behind her all the way to Oxford to get her back in school [for the summer].  I went with Catherine, and I&#8217;ve forgotten the woman&#8217;s name except her first name was Ruth, and we did that.  She got in her car, Catherine stayed right behind her, and we got on campus.
She was always very close to all of her students.  She knew what their problems were, just an unusual woman.  She started the first course on women.  It preceded the women&#8217;s studies courses that we have on our academic campuses today, and the comment was, even with the male students, &#8220;Have you had the course yet?  Have you had the course?&#8221;  She introduced us to a lot of issues in that course and she was really my inspiration and she was always there.
JW: Do you remember what sorts of issues came up in that course?  Was it a history course or--?
CN: Well she was in the school of education so the history department didn&#8217;t have anything like this.  In fact it was twenty years later before they had a women&#8217;s studies at the Ole Miss.  We were probably the last in the nation to do it.  Then she was also, while she was dean of women, she was a member of their organizations, and I went with her once or twice to their meetings.  She was really the dean of deans, just a marvelous organizer and trendsetter and opened doors.
JW: Can you describe your approach to activism?
CN: [Laughs] My approach. Well it started, I guess, with League of Women Voters activities here.  My first television appearance was for the League of Women Voters to get women on juries.  Then got to Mississippi and found women could not serve on juries there so I started speaking to legislators in meetings as an AAUW person.  Really AAUW got me started, as a member of that organization, into becoming an activist, and I [found it--.  The male legislators--.]  And all through my work with the Mississippi Humanities Council I had to deal with legislators.  They were my goal out there.  But I learned a lot through AAUW.  These male--.  [When it got down into a real argument,] why women can&#8217;t serve on juries.
Well by that time we had women coming out of the institutions of higher learning with PhDs, not many of them, but certainly for years I went to graduation at Ole Miss and I counted the ones graduating with honors.  I counted them, one, two, three, and invariably there were a few more women than men who graduated with a BA degree with honors at Ole Miss, so education to me and to my group was no problem, then what&#8217;s the problem?  It came down we only had one bathroom in the courthouses.  When I finally got on a jury I went looking for that one bathroom, you know, [Laughs] because that had been their argument, and of course at that time, forty years ago, most of us living in the South we only had one bathroom in the house for the family, if we had a bathroom in the house.  The rest of us went out to the toilets outside.  I never remember seeing a [line of family] standing outside of the toilet.  But that was a big question.
JW: Did you see yourself as identifying with one particular movement over another?
CN: I think we were so closely tied to the Civil Rights Movement.  We really gained a lot as women from the Civil Rights Movement.  The legislation that went through for the civil rights group included women and we haven&#8217;t paid our debt, I don&#8217;t think, to our black leaders who really got that through, because they opened our doors as well.
JW: Do you remember--?  Were you still involved with the League of Women Voters during your civil rights activity?
CN: Yeah.  I joined here in &#8217;59, paid my dues in the League of Women Voters up until this year.  At this age I decided I&#8217;m no longer nonpartisan.  I cannot represent the league as a political person.  I&#8217;ve got to work for my party.  So I was fifty years a League member.  Still a member of AAUW.
JW: Well in your work with League of Women Voters did you find any resistance to working toward civil rights issues, or were white women pretty open to the idea that civil rights was going to help them too?
CN: I don&#8217;t think we realized at the time that we were going to benefit as well as the blacks, but by this time I&#8217;m so involved in my job with the Humanities people and there I&#8217;m trying to work with black groups.  We had a population about thirty-five percent black, and when I got this job with Humanities--I was the founding director and worked there twenty-four years--we had a population roughly thirty-five percent black and I thought in my mind they&#8217;re going to get thirty-five percent of this federal money, which meant I had to go out, meet them, talk to them, help them write proposals.  If they wrote a proposal--and we wrote a lot of their proposals that were funded--but I insisted that if it was a black group they have one or two white professors on their program.  If I got a proposal from a white group I insisted that they too must have one or two black professors so that our professors would not be either white or black, so that brought me--.  I was in both camps there.  Then because my real interest was women we had a lot of programs funded by the Humanities Council that dealt with women&#8217;s rights, women&#8217;s legal rights, and so forth.
JW: What challenges did you face that surprised you, particularly in the Mississippi Humanities Council?
CN: Well I shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised, but to find a place--.  The first year we couldn&#8217;t find a--.  It was very hard because the superintendents did not want us to use their--didn&#8217;t want to submit a proposal.  They didn&#8217;t want us to come back to school [at night].  We funded a radio program in Holmes County.  The public schools there had about fifty-five thousand students and less than twelve [thousand] were white.  The white students either just dropped out of education altogether or there were a lot of private schools set up for the whites.  A lot of them didn&#8217;t survive.  One or two have.  We even installed a telephone so people could call in to the radio station when a professor was there and ask questions.  Finally I asked the radio people if they had any calls.  Not one while the professor was there, but [they] said a number of calls afterwards asking when will the next program be.  Well they were funded the second year--the same guy wrote the proposal--and they moved it to a community center in Lexington, Mississippi.  Even though it was open to everyone it was mostly blacks who came to that program.
We went to a school that was predominantly black, and Peggy Prenshaw from the University of Southern Mississippi was very much involved in that humanities program, and she stopped one day--she was speaking at this high school--and picked up her father to go with her.  They had to stop for gasoline and the father asked about the high school, and Peggy realized that the attendant at the filling station was giving them directions to the white school, and she said, &#8220;No, Daddy, we&#8217;re not going--.  We&#8217;re going to the black school.&#8221;  At that the attendant just turned and walked back into his station.  But she was very much involved in helping me, a white woman.
Then early on we had to get the issues that citizens were interested in so we had five meetings around the state, and the one in Hattiesburg that Peggy attended had one black woman who became very much interested in what we were doing, and she had a number of programs.  She could get a large group, she could involve whomever I asked her to put on the program, and she opened it to everyone, but of course it was mainly blacks who came.  Prentice Institute, which was an all-black institution, she had retired from Alcorn State University, which was predominantly black, but she became very much involved in our program.  So one by one I became her white daughter.  She talked about her children, and I thought this old woman had a houseful of children.  She didn&#8217;t have any children, but any young person that she thought had any ambition and stick-to-it-iveness became her friend, her daughter.  I became her white daughter.  She gave me directions every week what to do.  She was finally recognized at some school in Virginia by the Methodist Church for what she had done on the campus, and I got this call from Mrs. Dunham: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be in Virginia.  No one knows me there and I don&#8217;t want them to think that I&#8217;m just a black woman from Mississippi with no friends.  You send a telegram.&#8221;  Okay, I did.  [Laughs] I did just as she said.
So I made friends--.  [26:31 became the black woman.]
JW: So it seems really interesting to me that you were a leader of this Mississippi Humanities Council, you were involved in both civil rights and human rights, and you had a family of your own.  It seems like it must have been really difficult to handle all those things at once.  I&#8217;m wondering how you dealt with--.
CN: Well my husband was very cooperative until I just went to meeting after meeting.  Then he&#8217;d get irritated and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s enough of that woman&#8217;s stuff,&#8221; but he put up with it.  Then we had a commuter marriage.  We were on the campus, because we moved to Oxford in &#8217;61, and I got the job with the Humanities people in &#8217;72, and the first five years we were given an office on the campus to have the Humanities office there.  Then after five years it was very obvious that people were seeing the program not as a statewide program but as an Ole Miss program, so one of our members from Mississippi State entertained the director of higher education from Jackson one day, fed him cornbread and something, anyway over lunch, finally got us a room at the Institutions of Higher Leaning building in Jackson, Mississippi, so we moved there.  I knew that whomever went with the office was going to run it so I decided I&#8217;d better get up and move, so I did, and we had a commuter marriage then for over twenty years.  But my children were grown.  [In the] early years they had finished school.  My son went into the Marines and my daughter went to Tennessee to school in Murfreesboro and married a Tennessean.  So I had nights, and nights were devoted to women&#8217;s issues.
JW: What alliances did you rely on to help you do your work?
CN: AAUW was always behind me, League of Women Voters was behind me, but then I had a council of eighteen persons, black and white, and they stuck their necks out too in those days, but they were always behind me and gave me total support.  I remember while we were still at Oxford one day I got a call from a guy from Byhalia, Mississippi, white guy, because they were having a strike there.  The blacks were staying away from the white businesses and it was really in a mess.  He knew that we were doing programs on communication between the races and he suggested that we take a program to Byhalia.  I took that request to the Council and they said we&#8217;re not in the business to negotiate.  Stay out of Byhalia.  Well in about a few months they sent a federal person down to Byhalia to work to bring the group together and they had a bi-racial committee and the head of that committee was a minister.  It had three whites, three blacks, and then the secretary was white, which meant whites were four to three.  They invited me to come and talk about how they could do a program.  I went, and then I get this proposal where they&#8217;d written a proposal to do a program there.  Then the next day I get this call from this Baptist minister saying he signed the proposal; it all looked fine.  He said, &#8220;If that proposal is funded all hell&#8217;s going to break out in Byhalia.&#8221;  I thought, &#8220;One day I hope I see you in hell,&#8221; but I couldn&#8217;t work on the proposal by myself.  I couldn&#8217;t make a decision.  I had to take it to the Council.  They were the ones who granted or turned down the money.  I told my story and I confessed to what I had done, and I never shall forget it.  We had R.A. McLemore, who had been president of Mississippi College, a white guy, and he immediately moved, after he heard my story, &#8220;I move that we not fund this proposal because of limited funds.&#8221;  It passed.  No one ever questioned on that Council why I had done that or how I got myself in that predicament.  But I never did meet that white minister.  I could have kicked him.
JW: So what was the outcome?
CN: That we didn&#8217;t fund the proposal, so they didn&#8217;t get money for a program there.  After they told me to stay out of Byhalia I had gone.
JW: So did you--?  How did you deal with--?  I imagine white, Southern men were--
CN: Yeah.
JW: --very resistant to change.  How did you approach them and how did you try to negotiate with them?
CN: I never shall forget.  The League of Women Voters started doing a questionnaire.  They asked the candidates for whatever office they were running for certain questions, and these were published and then we distributed the answers, you know.  Two or three women, we drove out into the rural area from Oxford to distribute these brochures.  We came to this rural grocery store and there were some men on the porch, so we got out [to give them] and one man said, &#8220;Now you women just go on back home.  We&#8217;ll take care of this election.&#8221;  [That was the first 32:41]
But I dealt mostly in the legislature with the men, and of course they couldn&#8217;t kick me out.  They had to make some--.  So I went in with a smile, and told them what I needed, and didn&#8217;t get it, and walked out with a smile, and I&#8217;d go back.  That was true even when I was in Washington with the congressional people, because they had to pass out money for the National Endowment for the Humanities and I had to keep them apprised of what I was doing.  Eastland and Stennis, they were our two Senators at that time in the early &#8217;70s, and they were integrationists through and through, but Frank Barber, whom I met, he worked in Eastland&#8217;s office, Mississippian, so I began to talk to Frank.  When I was waiting to see Eastland I&#8217;d talk to Frank Barber.  He got interested in what I was doing and one day he took me to the Senate dining room.  The only time I was ever in the Senate dining room Frank had taken me.
Then after a number of years I decided it was time to meet the head of the Endowment.  I had been pushing the programs.  I had never met the chair of the Endowment.  So when I called the NEH they said, &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t have time to see you,&#8221; you know, &#8220;He&#8217;s going on a trip.&#8221;  So I immediately called my newfound friend, Frank Barber, and I said, &#8220;Frank, I&#8217;d like to meet this guy&#8221;--I&#8217;ve forgotten his name--&#8220;but he doesn&#8217;t have time to see me.&#8221;  [34:36] take him out for a drink.  In about five minutes Frank called me back.  He said, &#8220;He can&#8217;t have a drink with you, he&#8217;s going out of town, but he can have lunch with you before he leaves.&#8221;  I thought, I didn&#8217;t want that much time with him, but here we go.  So I said, &#8220;Frank, you&#8217;ll go with us?&#8221;  Yes, he&#8217;ll go.  So I was sitting in the chairman&#8217;s office.  He was busy.  I had to wait.  But then he saw Frank coming in and he got up and grabbed his coat and he was ready to go.  But just before he got there I said, &#8220;Frank, I&#8217;m having to wait on--.&#8221;  My memory&#8217;s not what it used to be.  So he said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ve got to go and dismiss the chauffeur.  He&#8217;s driving the Senator&#8217;s car and we&#8217;ll just have to walk.&#8221;  Before Frank got back he was out there, and we had a good time, and then later he came to Mississippi and I entertained with a group of the Council members on the river in Greenville, Mississippi.
But that&#8217;s how I worked my way into the Endowment activities and became quite personal with their staff.  In fact the first day I went I really made lifelong friends.  I had been hired in Mississippi for a humanities job.  I didn&#8217;t know what in the world the humanities were, but we had to deal with public policy issues, and there were five men that I had to deal with: the chancellor at Ole Miss, the dean of the law school at Ole Miss, and the philosophy professor at Ole Miss, and then the vice president at Mississippi State University and the president of Jackson State University.  I knew when the philosopher called me that he had convinced the chancellor.  I didn&#8217;t know until after I retired that it was really my mentor, Catherine Ray, who got me the job, but they were looking for someone to run this program and Tom Flynn had gone to Catherine Ray and apparently she gave him a recommendation that he could live with.
Earlier I had been working on continuing education for the director.  I had a desk in his office.  I did all of his correspondence, composed all of his correspondence.  After Meredith came all of the administrators were invited one day to the Lyceum Building to talk about the new policies that they had to enforce in order to get federal money.  I don&#8217;t know what policies they discussed, but when my boss came back he informed me that all women--we had a number of men working there--all women would sign in in the morning, sign out at night.  No man had to.  When I said, &#8220;You mean no man will have to?&#8221;  &#8220;No, just you women.&#8221;  I just turned, picked up my purse, and walked out.  Goodbye.  Well he was away from there before I got out in my car to go tell the chancellor what had happened, because I just left.  I knew that Chancellor Fortune knew all the details about my doing that, but Tom Flynn kept with it until he convinced the chancellor I was a person.  Then I knew [38:22] Williams, dean of the law school, would certainly follow the chancellor, and Tom Flynn was on my side, so I drove over to meet John Bettesworth at Mississippi State.  I had not met him, and he was nice but now warm.  Then John Peeples at Jackson State, the black guy, he had sent in his place to Washington for this group to be oriented his dean, Estes Smith.  So I went in to see Estes and he got out from behind his desk and came over and talked to me, just as nice as he could be, and he told me later my history in black studies started that day.
But after I finished the interview with Estes it was about mid-afternoon and normally I&#8217;d have a cup of coffee, and I thought well why not go to the student union and have your coffee?  Well I went--only black males.  I thought they were just giving me the once over.  I realize now they were having their own conversation.  They weren&#8217;t paying any attention to me.  But I didn&#8217;t finish that cup of coffee; I left.  That was my introduction to an all-black situation.
Estes became--.  He stayed on the Council longer than any other member and then I got him--.  He was elected to the Federation of State Humanities Councils when that was formed in 1977 and he&#8217;s been an advisor to that group ever since.
JW: What were the main goals you were working for on the Council?
CN: The main goal was to get issues out in public.  We&#8217;d had educational issues always.  We&#8217;d had programs [40:14] politician, but that politician would be either for or against.  In our program we had to bring them both together to talk about it and why they held onto these positions.  It was a first in Mississippi for that sort of thing.  And then it got where there was such a competition for our funds that I had to start raising some money.  That&#8217;s not my deal.  I&#8217;m not a good fundraiser.  But the second year, I think, we had the largest appropriation of any state from the federal government because of our background, so.
JW: So what sort of issues did the Council mostly focus on?
CN: Well the first few years [41:03] in education: Are our teachers really trained to do what they&#8217;re teaching?  That was a big issue.  Then even the first year we had programs on the communication.  With the schools now integrated, supposedly, they still had white teachers, and many of these white teachers were teaching in almost an all-black school that was a public institution but sending their own kids to a private school, and the communication was bad.  Then I heard about this black guy.  What I got, he could drop in one sentence from corporate English to the black dialect, and I said, &#8220;I need him.&#8221;  So I went to Mississippi Valley State University one afternoon to meet him and he was off campus and would not be back until that night, but he was living on campus in an apartment.  I went to his apartment, I was sitting there when he came in that night, and I told him what I needed.  I was dealing at that time with Tunica, up near Memphis, and they had the same situation that we had in Holmes County.  Most of their white students had withdrawn from the public school and were now in a private school, but they had these white teachers trying to teach the black kids and the communication sometimes was just out.  So Roy Hudson, and Roy went up the first time with our money, paid a small honorarium, but he did such a good job the school superintendent had him come back two or three more times and paid him out of their money instead of asking for us.
Roy later--.  Since I studied higher education for my PhD I knew that students had always rebelled against something on campus, organized and rebelled, and by now my office is down where the Institutions of Higher Learning is situated.  I looked down on the courtyard and it was filled with these black students, and there was Roy in the midst.  I went downstairs to go out and speak to Roy and there were our watchdogs holding the doors: &#8220;You can&#8217;t go out there.&#8221;  &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I go out there?&#8221;  &#8220;Well we&#8217;ve got a group of blacks out there.  You can&#8217;t go out there.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;But I am going out there.  I&#8217;m going to speak to them.&#8221;  Roy Hudson is a tall man; he stood out.  I went up to Roy and gave him a hug and kiss, and I mean those white guys are watching me, thinking they&#8217;re going to capture me, I guess.  Roy said, &#8220;They want to talk to Ted Thrash,&#8221; who&#8217;s head of the Institutions of Higher Learning, &#8220;and he won&#8217;t see them.&#8221;  Well, I said, &#8220;You know, they&#8217;ve always had such on campuses, and maybe, Roy, if you just get two or three to go sit down with Ted Thrash maybe he&#8217;d see [you.]&#8221;  Well that&#8217;s what they finally worked out and that was the end of that.  I never heard any more about it.  But just a matter of being human, humane, treating another one like a--.  I thought later I think I did a lot for Roy simply with that one hug and kiss I gave him.
JW: And it sounds like you became a mediator between some of the--.
CN: Well trying to get people to talk, that was my real problem.  They could attend and they could state their views, but if those views differed from a white person or vice versa, you know, they just shut up.  Well that ended one day.  We had a Council meeting and we had blacks and whites on it, and I had a new person, Connie Slaughter.  She was the first black woman to graduate from Ole Miss law school and she came on the Council determined that they were going to give the black proposals an equal chance.  Connie did not know that they had always been that way.  We had funded as many black proposals as white proposals.  But anyway, she kept raising these questions with this old guy who was in insurance, a white guy.  At this meeting we had a liaison person from Washington, D.C. there, and I don&#8217;t know what the issue was that day, I&#8217;ve forgotten it, but Connie said something and Newt, my white friend, jumps up and he has this stack of proposals in front of him, starts shredding them right there in the Council meeting.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to put up with this.  I&#8217;ve got to get back to work.&#8221;  So that ended the Council meeting, and on the way out Connie said, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ll just resign.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t.  You started this mess.  You can&#8217;t.&#8221; [Laughs]
So she missed the next Council meeting.  Then the governor appointed her to a position in his office.  Then that governor left and Connie went over to the state attorney&#8217;s--no, that&#8217;s not it--a state office, and found that they had an opening and they had an applicant from McComb, and that&#8217;s where her adversary lived.  In fact he ended up mayor of McComb.  So she picked up the phone and she calls Newt to ask about this man.  They had, apparently, a very nice conversation.  Then several years later there was a black board of aldermen in McComb that was retiring after a number of years and Connie was asked to give the address at his retirement dinner.  I wasn&#8217;t there but I was told that she looked up during her speech and Newt, the mayor, walked in, and she gave him as many plaudits as she was giving this guy she was down there to talk about.  That was what I heard, and they became good friends.
So I wrote all this up because that&#8217;s what we wanted to do.  We wanted people to express their views if they were different from the other point of view, get them out on the table, and then leave friends.  I wrote this up for my book and I sent each of them a copy and they both told me I could print it.  So they have become very good friends.  They got it out, got it said.
JW: Well I read in one of your bios that you also helped integrate women&#8217;s rights into the Academy, or bring more women into the Academy.  Is that correct?
CN: Bring women into the Academy.
JW: Or have women promoted into--have women&#8217;s positions in the universities--.
CN: Oh yeah.  That&#8217;s where I spent most of my time.  We realized, and this really started with AAUW but then the League joined us and the business and professional Women&#8217;s groups joined us, and we began to talk to our governor about appointing women to boards and commissions.  We realized that if a president of a university or college had to go to the Institutions for Higher Learning, to that board, every time there was a promotion in his ranks of professors, it had to be passed by that board, the Institutions of Higher Learning, and they were all men.  There had been a few women through the years but not very many.  So our goal was to have the governor that appointed the boards and commissions to appoint more women in those positions.  We found that very few of our English professors got beyond an assistant professorship, spent all their time teaching and grading essays.  They [went home], they had a--.  The associate professors were usually men and the full professors were always men, and in the history department at USM, and even Ole Miss, we didn&#8217;t have any women at all for years.
So we started that.  We started interviewing the gubernatorial candidates in my little condo in Jackson, we had a hot seat for them, and one of the women said, &#8220;I feel like a rat.  Every time we&#8217;re here and I start unwrapping cheese and getting them out for--.&#8221;  We had cheese and wine.  And so there we asked them two questions, the candidate that was running for governor: Will you appoint women to boards and commissions, and will you also appoint women to positions in your office, other than a secretarial position?  Well I think in 1980 or &#8217;84 William Winter was elected governor, and he had a press conference [and he] gave the name of a woman to some commission, but instead of Cora Norman--it wasn&#8217;t I; it was another woman--but he used the husband&#8217;s name, Mrs. W. H. [50:33] is [on the], and Norma Fields, a longtime friend and about the only female at the press conference, I think, raised her hand: &#8220;Governor, doesn&#8217;t that woman have a name?&#8221;  Well, I don&#8217;t know if he knew the name or not, but that really branded Norma, that she was looking for a woman&#8217;s name.
So it was hard, but as we did finally get more women appointed it meant that our presidents, when they were taking recommendations for the board to pass on, were more conscious that they had women in there.  We never saw a woman at graduation at the podium.  It was always male administrators and the dean of women, and then shortly after we went to Ole Miss they changed that title to dean of students and that was always a male.  The dean of students was not a woman, not there.
So it was a hard go and I think what helped us--and now we&#8217;ve got to keep it up--is that when more women started voting and a politician has just recently been aware that he&#8217;s got, or she&#8217;s got, to carry that women&#8217;s vote as well as the men&#8217;s vote if they want to be elected.  Now we&#8217;ve got to maintain that, and it&#8217;s still--.  We have a record in Mississippi that probably it&#8217;s up in the upper part of the rating in the nation of more women registered to vote, but they don&#8217;t go and vote.  They register and then that&#8217;s it.  So we&#8217;ve got to make sure those women start voting, and then eventually--.  We don&#8217;t have any female in the congressional group but we&#8217;ve got to get some female voices there.
JW: How would you say your views on feminism and activism have changed over time?
CN: Gotten stronger, both.  Activism, much stronger.  I mean we&#8217;ve got to open our mouths, we&#8217;ve got to go in and greet these people, and especially our power now is that vote, and if they&#8217;re running for a senator or representative they&#8217;ve got to be conscious of how those women are going to vote.  Now our problem in Mississippi, too often women follow the pattern that their men, their husbands, how they vote.  I campaigned--.  I decided to run for office in 1990 and I started out campaigning [to be auditor].  I remember knocking on one door, handing my card to this woman, she said, &#8220;Well my husband tells me how to vote,&#8221; and I think that&#8217;s typical of our women still in Mississippi, so we&#8217;ve got to change that.  Education is one way, and with less than fifty percent of our adults having finished high school we&#8217;ve got a long way to go in education.
JW: And what about your views on feminism?  How have they changed over time?
CN: Stronger, because I think a strong woman is needed in these top positions.  You&#8217;ve got to make sure that--.  And some of our women have failed in this respect.  They&#8217;re not perceived--if they&#8217;re the top dog--they&#8217;re not perceived as one who cares about the workers under them.  They have their favorites.  And I think--.  I hear a lot of stories now.  My son-in-law, he was with Nissan and now he&#8217;s working with--.  I don&#8217;t know exactly what they do but they make these big panels and all men are working there.  We&#8217;ve just got to know that it&#8217;s not anti-male, it&#8217;s not anti-person, but it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to sell.  If we&#8217;re in business to produce couches or whatever it is, the people who are under that female, she must recognize that it&#8217;s a product, that she needs to make sure that they hold a line there and live up to the product, and I think women still have a lot to learn there, how to do it.
JW: What was the impact of these movements on your life?
CN: Well I&#8217;ve traveled more.  I became an internationalist, a lot of it in Jackson.  When I was in Oxford I began to entertain foreign students.  In Oxford, especially at Thanksgiving, they didn&#8217;t have--.  We had a lot of--.  There those early ones, I guess, were from China or [somewhere] from Asia.  Thanksgiving was something new.  Then when I went to Jackson I got very much involved in international affairs with a group on the Jackson campus.  They had internationalists to come from mostly Africa and that part of the world, and I entertained them often in my little condo, and I was also president of their advisory group.  When I retired I went immediately six weeks to China on a Fulbright-Hays scholarship to look at women&#8217;s issues in China.  And then my friend who got me on that list, who had the grant from Rust College, Gemma Beckley, I&#8217;d known her--a black woman--known her longer than any other friend in Mississippi, and in a year or two she took me to South Africa for the same thing, six weeks there visiting their universities there and what women&#8217;s issues were.  Then she was invited to give the introductory speech to a social workers international conference in South India, and by then I really began to love the travel.  I said, &#8220;Gemma, I&#8217;ll go along and I&#8217;ll carry your bags.&#8221;  So I went with her.  Because I was with Gemma I was treated like a dignitary too.  They met us at the airport, took us to lunch, drove finally to the campus.  The president and two or three of the staff people were standing out [at the end] with roses in their hand.  Then after the conference--it was about a three-day conference--after the conference the [school social worker] who had put this conference together, he and his wife took us on a two-day trip of that area and then back to the airport.  I&#8217;d never been treated like that in a foreign country.  It was wonderful.  So, now I&#8217;m working on a trip to Thailand.
JW: How would you describe your legacy as an activist?
CN: My what?
JW: Your legacy.
CN: As an activist? [Laughs] Simply not only meeting people of different cultures but really wanting to get to know them.  When I went to South Africa with Gemma I think there were about fifteen in our group, and we had this woman from India who taught at Rust College but she and her husband both had come from India.  I really wanted to know more about her so somehow I arranged where we would room together on that trip.  Well our first night, afternoon, in Cape Town I was running to the bar, not to get a drink--I should have--but to get a bottle of water, and I fell.  There was a little step, just about like that.  I just splattered, fractured my arm up here in three places.  I couldn&#8217;t lift my arm.  Sheila, my roommate, she undressed me, she dressed me, she bathed me, she laced my shoes.  I didn&#8217;t miss a thing because of Sheila.  The group got started the next morning and I was right there with them.  I&#8217;ll love that woman forever.  She&#8217;s a--not a Buddhist.  What is it they practice there?
JW: Maybe Hinduism?
CN: Hinduism, or something like that.  I&#8217;m not sure what it was, but it didn&#8217;t matter to me.  She was certainly my friend, and whenever I&#8217;m at Rust I always see Sheila.
JW: Well are there any other topics you would like to bring up, or are there any questions you thought I would ask that I didn&#8217;t that you&#8217;d like to address?
CN: Well I think I did not want to go to Mississippi when we moved there but it certainly made an interesting life for me.  It opened my eyes.  [I was] changed.  I could state my views and live a life openly.  I could go up and hug any black man I wanted to and he wouldn&#8217;t slap me, just have that freedom that we don&#8217;t have usually in the South.  So, it was a good life.  I enjoyed it.
