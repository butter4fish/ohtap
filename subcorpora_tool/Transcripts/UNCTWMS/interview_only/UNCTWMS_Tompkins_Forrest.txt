Jessie Wilkerson: This is Jessie Wilkerson and it&#8217;s May 17, 2011, and I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee interviewing Dr. Tompkins, also known as Dr. T, I hear.
Forrest Tompkins: Yes.
JW: So Dr. Tompkins, can you first tell me when and where you were born?
FT: I was born in Irvona, Pennsylvania, which is a little tiny town in western Pennsylvania about a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of Pittsburgh. It&#8217;s a brickyard town, or was a brickyard town, and I lived there until I was almost sixteen. Then we moved to Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, which is north of Irvona, and that&#8217;s where I graduated from high school. What else did you need to know about that?
JW: Well, can you tell me a little bit about your family? What did your parents do?
FT: Oh, okay. My dad was one of the old time country docs, and he was the brickyard town doctor and surrounding area farmers and coal miners and stuff like that. My mother had been a grade school teacher until she married my father. When he set up practice I was almost three years old because he was still a student in medical school when they got married. I don&#8217;t know what all you need to know about this, but-.
JW: You can keep going. [Laughs]
FT: Okay. I just didn&#8217;t know how deep to go. This was way back in the [19]30s now, right after the Depression, and things were not too great then, financially and so forth. My grandparents, my mother&#8217;s parents, lived in Irvona, and they had some crazy laws in the state at that time and one law was if a lady got married they couldn&#8217;t teach. They had to become a housewife and a mother and all that stuff. In fact you would never see a pregnant woman teaching school. So when my mother got pregnant with me she had no job, so she moved in with my grandma, her parents, there. The town doctor then was a Dr. Early, and he had been a year or two ahead of my dad in school. Pittsburgh Medical School is where my dad went. In those days their senior year in medical school they were farmed out to GPs [General Practitioners] in towns and my dad chose to come to Irvona for his, I guess you&#8217;d call it a type of internship. Anyway, he spent several months there with Dr. Early. So when he graduated from med school he went and took his internship in Altoona, which is thirty-six miles from Irvona, and then Dr. Early wanted to leave and go to another town and go into partnership there so he turned his practice over to Dad. So that&#8217;s how Dad got to Irvona, plus the fact my granddad was there. My dad was in debt because he didn&#8217;t come from a rich family, so my granddad was a well-respected citizen there and he could sign notes and stuff for my dad because that&#8217;s the only way Dad could get financially started in practice. So that&#8217;s pretty much the background there.
JW: Did you ever go with your father to the office? Did he inspire you to study medicine?
FT: Well, that&#8217;s the other thing. The years that he was in Irvona there his office was in his home. We had a big home and the office was part of the home, so I was right in the mix there, with patients coming and going all the time. He made house calls of course, that was the thing they did in those days, the GPs. He used to take me occasionally to the farmhouses and I would see him treat patients and so forth. That wasn&#8217;t real often but occasionally he did take me on house visits. So I was pretty close to medicine the whole time growing up there.
JW: So when did you actually decide that you wanted to become a doctor?
FT: Well, it was some time after my freshman year in high school I know that, because my freshman year in high school we had to write a paper for a class about what we wanted to be. I had an uncle by marriage who I admired very much and he was an engineer, and I always liked airplanes and stuff-nowadays it would be called aerospace; it was aeronautical engineering then. So I wrote in the term paper that I was going to be an engineer, an aeronautical engineer. Some time after my freshman year I decided to go into medicine and I can&#8217;t [say] just exactly when that was. I think it was when we moved to Philipsburg my junior year in high school. Now I have a younger brother, four and a half years younger than me, and from the time he was five years old he said he was going to be a physician, and he is. He&#8217;s a dermatologist, retired now.
JW: So what was your mom doing all those years after she had to give up teaching? Was she mostly a housewife?
FT: She took care of the house and ran everything. She was a homemaker, or whatever. In those days they worked pretty hard. It wasn&#8217;t always that easy up there.
JW: What are the types of things that she did to run the household?
FT: Well my dad wanted to concentrate on the practice of medicine. He wasn&#8217;t a handyman or anything like that. He didn&#8217;t fix things around the house, nothing. So Mother took care of all that and got people in and supervised everything. When we went on vacations she planned everything and took care of us kids and that sort of thing. So she ran the house, is what I&#8217;m saying, and that was pretty much her role. Now years later after we got to Philipsburg-I don&#8217;t know how much you want about my family history, but I have a sister that&#8217;s twenty years younger than me. My mother was forty-five when she had my sister. Back in those days that was a no-no.
JW: So you have one brother and one sister; any other siblings?
FT: Yeah. My sister&#8217;s twenty years younger than me. She teaches at Hiwassee College down in Madisonville. She has a PhD in philosophy and English.
JW: Let&#8217;s see. So can you tell me about how you made a decision to go into the Army and be a physician in the Army?
FT: Well, [Laughs] that&#8217;s a little involved. When I went to college at Washington &amp; Jefferson the Korean War was on, and I joined the ROTC, and most of the students joined the ROTC the first two years. They were advised to do that or, I don&#8217;t know. But then if you wanted to get a commission you had to go on to advanced ROTC the last two years. I really wasn&#8217;t that interested in going into advanced ROTC, and my grades were pretty good at that time. But my mother was afraid that they would draft me out of college and I would interrupt my medical training. So she advised me to go back and sign up for the advanced ROTC and that way I would get a commission as an officer. The only thing they offered there was transportation corps so when I graduated I got a BA degree, which is unusual for medical students. [Laughs] That&#8217;s another story.   But anyway, when I graduated I also got a 2nd lieutenant&#8217;s commission in the transportation corps. When I was accepted in medical school they deferred me, and at that time they also had medical ROTC under Eisenhower. He discontinued it later, but I joined the medical ROTC in med school until they discontinued it. But they deferred me for med school and internship but then I owed them two years, so my initial plan was to go in and serve my two years payback for ROTC and then get out. I was going to go back home and work in the hospital for awhile, but I decided I wanted to specialize, because they had a hospital in Philipsburg that would hire house physicians and my dad could get me in there. So that&#8217;s my plan initially, but then I got to thinking-. I got married right before I went in the Army, actually I got married before my internship, and by the end of my first year in the Army we had our first child. My dad was not a rich doctor-you don&#8217;t get rich in general practice in small towns-and he was in debt, too. He had to pay off debts, and he did. So I was thinking about specializing but I thought, gees, on the outside in those days they didn&#8217;t pay enough for one person let alone-. I&#8217;d have had to go into debt up to here, and I didn&#8217;t really want to go into debt.   So I was interested in urology, ophthalmology, and OB-GYN and a residency became available. They started a new residency in OB-GYN at Madigan General Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, that&#8217;s Ft. Lewis out there, in the Army. So I applied and at first I was an alternate, so I still decided to go back home. Then they accepted me in the program. Now I was a captain in the Army and that&#8217;s a pretty good salary and the benefits and healthcare and all that, so I decided to get my specialty in the Army although I knew I would owe them three years more, so that&#8217;s what I did. At the end of the two-year I went and had a three-year residency at Madigan General then I owed them three more years.   After my residency I went to Ft. Campbell, Kentucky and I&#8217;d planned to still get out in three years, but my second year all of a sudden I get overseas orders. Now, I could go overseas and take my family on my own and just spend two years there and then I would still be able to get out. Or I could let the Army send my family with me and all, pay for that, but then I had to stay there three years. So I decided that&#8217;s the way I&#8217;d go, so we moved and went to Germany for three years. Well one thing led to another and we decided to extend in Germany for another year so I was four years in Germany. By the time I got back to the States I was a lieutenant colonel, and I had eleven years invested in the military. So then I started thinking about career and that&#8217;s when I made the decision to stay in, and I stayed for twenty-one.
JW: And where did you go after Germany?
FT: I went to Ft. Eustis, Virginia and I was the chief of professional services there. That&#8217;s second in command of the hospital. It&#8217;s like chief of staff and also second in command of the hospital. I did that and then I was thinking about when I retired what I was going to do, and I thought maybe I would go into public health, so I applied at Chapel Hill and I was accepted. Oh, I had to go and get permission from a general. At that time in the Army they were handing out fellowships for various things, but I wasn&#8217;t sure they would give me a fellowship for public health because they were usually giving it for other academic things, super specialties like oncology and stuff like that. So I went to this general and had an interview with him, he was the head guy that made the decisions about this, and I didn&#8217;t think I was going to get approved for that. After I talked to him he said, okay; you get accepted at North Carolina, I&#8217;ll approve you. So I went for an interview at North Carolina and I got accepted there and sent him the letter and he set up everything. So I was allowed to leave the Army and go to civilian life for one year at North Carolina to get my master&#8217;s in public health, so I got a master of science in public health.
JW: Did your family go with you?
FT: Yeah. Oh yeah, they moved the family and everything.
JW: And at that point you had three daughters.
FT: Yeah, well by that time my youngest daughter was born in Germany, at W&#252;rzburg, Germany, in 1967. She was only a year old when we moved back to the States. The Vietnam War was on then, when I was at Chapel Hill, and of course at that time the University of North Carolina had done away with ROTC, they were against the war, so in some circles I don&#8217;t think I was too popular there. After I finished at Chapel Hill I figured they were going to send me-. They were sending everybody to Vietnam; even OB-GYNs were going. The chief of OB at Walter Reed Army Hospital and Medical Center there, he even was sent for a year to Vietnam and somebody had to take over and run the program, so I figured I was a prime candidate now to go to Vietnam. So I called my consultant in Washington and I said, hey, I&#8217;ve got my family settled here, my kids are in the schools and everything, and if you&#8217;re going to send me to Vietnam send me now. He says, nope; we have other plans for you. We&#8217;re going to send you to [Ft. Belvoir, Virginia], and that&#8217;s Darnall Army Hospital there. So that&#8217;s where I went, and I was also chief of professional services there and I did some GYN. I&#8217;d already given up OB pretty much and I did GYN work and was deputy commander and supervised the doctors in the hospital at Darnall, and I was there five years. Then I finished up at the hospital there at Ft. Hood the last two years and decided to retire at that time.
JW: Can you say a little bit about the OB-GYN training that you received through the military?
FT: Yeah, we had a good residency program there. Some of my instructors-. The chief of our service was a career military OB-GYN, but one of his assistant chiefs that ran the program was in for just two or three years. He was an academic guy with a good background and he later went back to the University of Michigan and taught there, but he was one of the assistant chiefs that taught me, so we had two really good assistant chiefs, and then there were the regular residents and all. But it was a good program, and the only thing I&#8217;d wish for was that the chief of the service there was pretty conservative as far as the surgery and so I didn&#8217;t feel that I got as much surgical training as I would have liked. But the OB, we delivered more babies than most civilian medical centers because the Berlin crisis was going on and they sent a whole division, wives included, out in one year and we went from about a hundred and fifty deliveries a month to two [hundred] forty in just a short time, and that was something, so the OB experience was excellent.
JW: So when did you develop this interest in reproductive health? Can you think of anything that-? How did you make that decision?
FT: Well, I&#8217;m not sure what aspect-. I considered myself in reproductive health in OB-GYN.
JW: Exactly, and I mean in general.
FT: Yeah, but I was one of the few in the Army in the later years that would do abortions, so even though I was-. At Ft. Hood I was chief of OB the last two years in the Army. I went back to running the OB service, and there were only a couple of us out of a fairly good staff of about six or seven doctors there in OB, there were only two of us that would do abortions. We were doing them in the Army then, so I was one that was willing to do abortions. That&#8217;s one of the reasons I came to Knoxville, because I had known Dr. Mueller in the Army, but he got out after about seven years in the military and he came to Morristown and later came on his own to Knoxville. He needed a partner here in Knoxville so, instead of going into public health, I decided to come here and go into partnership in GYN practice with him and then work at the clinic. So that&#8217;s one of the reasons I came here, because I was willing to work at an abortion clinic.
JW: So you were trained to do the procedure pretty early? I mean you were willing to perform abortions through your whole career in the military? Was that pretty common, that military physicians were trained?
FT: No, actually every physician is trained in D&amp;Cs and stuff, but as far as the abortion training I think I-. It&#8217;s hard to go back that far and remember just how I learned the abortion techniques. I think I learned it from other guys that were doing them, but it wasn&#8217;t a specialized training at that time. But I picked up the technique because once you know how to do D&amp;Cs you can pick up the suction and all that stuff. That&#8217;s not so different. So I guess I picked it up pretty much on my own, but I had done some in the Army before I came here and then I did a lot more here.
JW: So you were performing abortions in the military when for citizens in the US it wasn&#8217;t legal under most circumstances yet. Was the military ahead of the curve?
FT: Well, yeah, they approved abortions and also I did them on WACs and the Army military females that needed abortion, that wanted them, but we didn&#8217;t do a lot. It wasn&#8217;t that high a percentage that we did there over the years. I believe I first learned it at Belvoir from some of the guys that were trained in civilian hospitals that were working for me there and doing abortions and so forth, but there weren&#8217;t a lot of us doing them in the military. Most of them didn&#8217;t want to do it.
JW: And why not?
FT: Well some had religious hang-ups about it and others, they just didn&#8217;t want to do it, and nobody could force them to do it, so it was just the ones that agreed to do it that performed them at that time.
JW: Had your father delivered babies as the general physician?
FT: Yeah, the country docs there, he delivered out in the farmhouses and everywhere. He had, not a trained midwife like they have today, but he had an old time midwife that went with him, and sometimes my mother went and helped him with deliveries. That&#8217;s one thing she did, and actually I&#8217;m a home delivery. I was delivered in my grandma&#8217;s house by Dr. Early, the friend of my dad&#8217;s, and my grandma helped him deliver me. See, my grandparents were blue collar. My grandfather was a carpenter and at the time I was born he was head carpenter at the brickyard. My grandma grew up on a farm and she was used to delivering farm animals and stuff and she was a farm girl and moved into town when she married granddad, so she knew how to assist in delivering. So I was delivered in her home. Now my brother, four and a half years later, he was born in a hospital in Altoona where my dad interned. She had a specialist deliver her then, but Doc Early delivered me. So, most all of them up in those towns did obstetrics.
JW: Do you know if they also performed abortions?
FT: Not at that time, no. At that time it was illegal.
JW: Right.
FT: See it was illegal then so the only people that did abortions were in the back, [Laughs] you know, in the back alley.
JW: Uh huh. But in the military abortions were legal.
FT: Yeah, at that time they were, but I think later on in recent years I think they won&#8217;t use federal funds for-.
JW: Right.
FT: Isn&#8217;t that the way? I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s it now. I&#8217;ve lost track of it, but I think it&#8217;s been shut off in the military now, that they won&#8217;t use federal funds for elective abortion unless there&#8217;s a medical reason.
JW: Can you say why you were one of the doctors who was willing to perform abortions?
FT: Well, early on I believed in free choice and I figured, as my partner did too here, we figured it was better for well-trained people to do abortions in legitimate facilities rather than the back alleys, so I always felt that it was better for a trained person to be doing them. Of course some doctors did them in their office and some of them were caught. Then I went to the school of public health and when I went through that year of public health there, too, they favored abortion and free choice, so I sort of got indoctrinated there, too.
JW: Had you seen women who had gone to the back alley, who had gone through illegal abortions that hadn&#8217;t been safe?
FT: No, I didn&#8217;t have much contact with septic abortions that were done. It seems to me I did have one lady that came to me years ago, and I can&#8217;t remember the circumstances, that had had an illegal abortion and she was in bad shape when I got her, but I didn&#8217;t see too many of that because when I was doing them it was legal. There weren&#8217;t as many in the off areas because people could go to legitimate clinics.
JW: I&#8217;ve heard that Dr. Mueller had some conflict about abortion. Did he-?
FT: Yeah.
JW: He thought they should be legal, but-.
FT: We used to talk about that. He had to rationalize it because he didn&#8217;t really like abortion and yet he was the medical director of the clinic and he did them, but when we talked about it he said the way he rationalized it was that it was better to have it done by a well-trained person in a legitimate facility than in the back alley, and that&#8217;s the way he rationalized it. But he had some hang-ups about abortion, yeah, but he did them because he felt it was the best solution.
JW: And did you have that similar conflict?
FT: No, I didn&#8217;t. I felt that I was helping a known quantity versus an unknown quantity. [Laughs] That&#8217;s the way I looked at it, you know. I mean for a girl thirteen or fourteen to have to go through a whole pregnancy and then give up the baby, that is really, really difficult, I felt, so I had a different aspect of looking at this whole thing. I thought I was helping someone. Even though I realized that I was terminating a potential life I felt it was justified.
JW: What year did you start working at the clinic?
FT: Well, when I came here in 1978. Fourteen years I worked there.
JW: Can you describe those early months or years at the clinic? How did it change your understanding of women&#8217;s health, or did it change your understanding?
FT: Well, early on we did a fair number there, much more so than the military, so I got a little different viewpoint as far as the needs for counseling and all this sort of thing because we didn&#8217;t have all that in the military. We did the abortions in the operating room and that was it, and I don&#8217;t think there was a heck of a lot of counseling going on for the women, and when I got to the clinic it was a whole different ballgame. We had counselors sitting with the patient in the abortion room, in the operating room, and that was a little different aspect. I got a little different viewpoint of what was needed for the total picture, to help the woman in totality rather than just doing the procedure.
JW: So those women in the military, like the WACs, they just wanted an abortion, came and got one, and there was no other services that you know of?
FT: I don&#8217;t think there was much counseling. Maybe they had to see a psychiatrist. I think they had to go and see a psychiatrist there at the Army base or talk to him, but it wasn&#8217;t like the well run clinics. Now there are some that weren&#8217;t well run. They were the mills, you know, and that&#8217;s not the kind of clinic I&#8217;m-. I would not work at a clinic like that. But the clinic down here was what I considered well run and with the whole aspects of the woman taken care of and counseling and all that sort of stuff, but there wasn&#8217;t a lot of that in the military. I think they had to see a psychiatrist before they had the abortion, if I remember correctly. It&#8217;s been a long time, though.
JW: So how did it make you feel when the protest movement started at the clinics?
FT: That was very aggravating, and sometimes they even harassed me at home here, but the harassment was-it was tough to take, you know, because-. I can&#8217;t say I liked it.
JW: How did they harass you here, at your home?
FT: Well once in awhile, not frequently but once in awhile, somebody would come put something on the door or knock and say something. I didn&#8217;t get a lot here but occasionally. But they really harassed us pretty good down at the clinic.
JW: Have you kept up with the recent attacks on abortion, the political uses of it?
FT: I haven&#8217;t kept up with all that, but I know they&#8217;re trying to change the Roe v. Wade. I can understand the concern with the real late abortions. To be honest I really didn&#8217;t care much for the [late-term], the third trimester abortions, or second trimester actually, but I did them because I was good at it, but I didn&#8217;t really-. When we started doing those at the clinic I really didn&#8217;t favor that too much, but I did them because it was needed and I could see the need, and I had done a couple in the Army for medical reasons. A diabetic I had done; she was almost twenty weeks when I did her in the Army. I got a lot of criticism for that too from some of the nurses and people but she was diabetic and I felt it was indicated. But I&#8217;ve never really-. I would much prefer doing an abortion in the first three months, that&#8217;s my feeling, so I really didn&#8217;t care much for the second trimester ones, but I did them because I thought it was a need.
JW: Did you ever imagine that the word, abortion, and these ideas of abortion would be politicized the way that they were, that people would use that as a wedge issue or a way to attack other programs?
FT: No, I didn&#8217;t really think much about that aspect of it.
JW: Or that candidates would run on a pro-life platform?
FT: No, I didn&#8217;t really think much about that, really. I&#8217;m not really into politics that deep. I just sort of do my thing and vote the way I see it, and I don&#8217;t get into a lot of political discussions or conflicts. I just sort of do my thing and maybe I should be more politically active, but I never have been. Doctors tend not to be, a lot of us, and we probably should be more active politically in medicine because the politicians-. One of the reasons I retired, not the only reason, but this managed care moved in, and when they start telling you how to practice-and if we had more physicians in politics it would be a little different-but most physicians don&#8217;t want to mess with politics, that&#8217;s the thing. There should be more of us politically active, I think, the way things are going today. Even medicine needs some regulation, there&#8217;s no doubt about it, but the way it is now where you almost have to conform to certain things to practice, it&#8217;s difficult. It&#8217;s driving a wedge into-. As one of the presidents of the Tennessee Medical Association in a recent article, he was saying it&#8217;s sort of driven a wedge a lot of times between doctors, that in order to practice-. We don&#8217;t have the unity we once had because there are so many conflicts in what you have to do to practice and you get centered on specifics in the practice and you don&#8217;t unify like we used to, you know. I guess he&#8217;s right.
JW: What have been some of the biggest changes you&#8217;ve seen since you started practicing in the &#8217;50s until when you retired in the &#8217;90s?
FT: Well, the whole managed care system. I grew up more in the free practice and now in order to survive a lot of doctors have to go into groups. It&#8217;s hard out there in a single practice now the way things are set up, and that&#8217;s probably the biggest thing, from individual practices or small partnerships into these large groups, and they feel they have to do that to survive now so they&#8217;re banding together into big groups, specialists and everybody, and it&#8217;s changed a lot that way, from even in the early days of my practice. That&#8217;s probably the biggest thing.
JW: And especially like your dad&#8217;s practice doesn&#8217;t seem like it would really be viable.
FT: My dad wouldn&#8217;t even recognize medicine today. Back then-. After we moved to Philipsburg where he had a more regulated practice he occasionally made a house call even in Philipsburg but not like he did up in the country, and he had a hospital to work in. He didn&#8217;t have a hospital up there and so forth. But even in his practice it was a lot different than practicing in a tiny little brickyard town.
JW: And what was your wife&#8217;s name?
FT: Dorothy.
JW: And did she work?
FT: She was a medical technologist at Temple, that&#8217;s how we met. When I was an intern she worked in a small hospital on the outskirts of Philadelphia as a medical tech, but then after I got in the Army she decided to just be a homemaker and raise the kids and so forth, but after our divorce-I got divorced in &#8217;82-she went back to work and she worked for the state public health as a medical tech. She had to retrain some and all that because it had been years since she&#8217;d practiced, but she was a board certified medical technologist when we married.
JW: So how did working in women&#8217;s health affect how you raised your daughters?
FT: I can&#8217;t say that-. I really don&#8217;t have an answer to that. I mean my daughters were always special to me, and I don&#8217;t know as I looked at them any different because I was in OB-GYN and the clinic and all that. I think I was pretty broadminded with them. I had some certain rules and discipline, but when they needed birth control they came to me and I arranged for a doctor friend of mine to give them their examinations and put them on the pill.
JW: So there was an openness there.
FT: Yeah, pretty open. We communicated pretty well and we still do, in spite of the divorce and all that. That hit them pretty hard. Of course my oldest daughter was already married then, she married fairly young, and my middle daughter was in college, so Cathy, my youngest, was only thirteen when the divorce happened and that&#8217;s the one it hit the hardest. But I think my wife and I handled it pretty well. I&#8217;m still very close to my daughters, all three of them, and they&#8217;re close to their mother, too. It&#8217;s sort of a strange situation; they didn&#8217;t take sides. They understood both our problems so they&#8217;re fine with both of us right now, and in recent years I&#8217;ve mellowed some. At first I wouldn&#8217;t even talk to my ex-wife, but that&#8217;s changed in recent years. We go to soccer games and sit beside each other, watching the grandkids, so we&#8217;ve sort of settled our differences somewhat.
JW: So did you see yourself at all as part of the women&#8217;s movement or helping facilitate the things that were happening in the women&#8217;s movement?
FT: Yeah. I think that when I thought about it I considered that I was part of the movement, especially after the public health experience. We had a lot of guest speakers and people and a lot was surrounding abortion and these issues with the women&#8217;s movement at that time when I was at Chapel Hill so I got to feel a part of it there. And then I always felt that I was somewhat a part of it.
JW: Do you recall any of the speakers or any of the conversations you had in that program at Chapel Hill?
FT: Not specifically. It&#8217;s been a long time ago and we had numerous guest speakers. I know one of my advisors at the school of public health, he had been the chief of OB at Vanderbilt over here and when I was in the military stationed at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, when we could we would travel down to attend some of his lectures and the resident get-togethers at Vanderbilt University, so several of us would make the trip from Ft. Campbell down to Nashville. His name was Bob Noyes and he did a lot of research on endometriosis and expert on that, but he went into public health for awhile. He bounced around some so I ran into him when I got to the school of public health. He came in there and he was one of my advisors, and I had known him when I attended his lectures at Vanderbilt. [Laughs] It&#8217;s funny how-. And so he was an advisor and he was into the movement, too.   When I got my master&#8217;s in public health, when I came back to Belvoir my advisor in Washington instructed me that I had to put on a family planning panel and get together this panel at a national meeting. So at the Armed Forces Division OB-GYN meeting, I think that was in Seattle-that was a long time ago-and so the panel I had was Bob [Noyes] and, oh gees, there was a lady who was well known and I can&#8217;t remember her name right now, and then there was a military-. He was a colonel then, he later became a major general, and he was interested in the family planning movement and all. So I had a panel on family planning, and I gave the introduction lecture and then they each gave their own lectures on the topic of family planning and birth control and abortion and so forth. So I did have a national meeting I put on for that, after my stint in public health.
JW: Do you recall how that panel was received?
FT: It was received pretty well at the meeting.
JW: Well, I don&#8217;t think I have any other questions. Is there anything else you can think of that you would like to add?
FT: No. I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s been so long that I don&#8217;t remember all the specifics about so many things, but it&#8217;s over eighteen years since I practiced here in Knoxville and that goes back even further when I was in the military.
JW: I think what you provided is great. It fills a gap. We haven&#8217;t heard from as many physicians so that&#8217;s an important story to hear, how people got to the point where they were working in a clinic, so you were very specific about that.
FT: I hope I helped out some.
JW: Yes, you did.
