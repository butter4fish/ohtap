Mary Koenig: This is Mary Koenig. It&#8217;s June 7, 2013, and I am here with Salli Benedict in her home in Carrboro, North Carolina, and we are going to talk a little bit about her experiences as a public health worker in Chapel Hill and about her life during several important moments in the women&#8217;s movement. So if we could start with your early life, can you tell me a little bit about your experience growing up?
Salli Benedict: Sure. My father was in the Air Force so that meant that my family moved every two or three years the whole time I was growing up&#8211;I think I went to nine schools&#8211;but had a really wonderful experience through that of traveling around the world. So we lived in Japan when I was in first, second, and third grade, and we lived in the Philippines my last year of high school, and we lived in California, and Washington state, and Florida, and had a lot of interesting experiences, and I think that I flourished in that, in that it&#8217;s pretty easy for me to make friends and I really like people a lot and I like traveling a lot. So a lot of my life has been working with people in a positive way and I think that childhood had a lot to do with it.   Do you want to ask another question, or do you want me to continue?
MK: How about we talk about how you ended up in North Carolina.
SB: Oh, well, I should back up because my experience with the women&#8217;s movement started before I moved to North Carolina.
MK: Okay, yeah. Let&#8217;s hear about that.
SB: So the late [19]60s were an incredible time in this country in that there was so much upheaval in so many ways. There was music. That was changing a lot. I remember the Beatles had a song, &#8220;All You Need is Love,&#8221; and that seemed like such a revolutionary song at the time. So I was going to&#8211;. My parents were living in the Philippines and I came back to the States to go to the University of Florida, but I fell in love with someone whose parents were also in the Air Force. And I had known him in Florida and I knew him in the Philippines, and we fell in love. He went to Williams College, which was in western Massachusetts, which was a hotbed. I mean New England was&#8211;. College kids were really getting revolutionized.   So we dropped out of college after two years and we got married and we moved to North Adams, Massachusetts, which was a struggling mill town, a poor mill town, and we became VISTA volunteers, and we organized&#8211;. This was my first introduction really to the fact that there was poverty. I remember meeting these welfare mothers, and we were friends, and they were really great women, and how they struggled raising their kids and making ends meet until that welfare check came. A lot of people worked in the factories in that town and I had never really been exposed to that, and I remember one of them saying, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re rich,&#8221; and I had never thought of myself as rich. I had only thought of myself&#8211;. I was just middle class but to them I was rich, and that particular statement, and being a VISTA volunteer at that time, and being exposed to all those things was a huge eye-opener. It blew my mind, and my husband at the time&#8211;-my first husband, so we were like nineteen and twenty years old when we got married, and we were VISTA volunteers&#8211;-he and his friends were radical, went to a lot of demonstrations and organized against the Vietnam War.   So all of that was going on, and I met a woman, who&#8217;s still a friend of mine, who at the time&#8211;. So I was probably twenty-one, it was maybe 1969, and she had lived in New York and she told me about the women&#8217;s movement and she told me about consciousness-raising groups. She also introduced me to yoga. She taught me some yoga, which I had never heard of, and in fact right now I actually teach yoga to seniors. I&#8217;ve done yoga pretty much ever since then. She also introduced me to whole foods, like brown rice, all of this. So here I am, twenty, twenty-one years old, married, far away from my family, and being exposed to all kinds of new ideas.   So after our year was done with VISTA my husband went back to Williams College and I went to a Massachusetts state college, North Adams State College, and was majoring in education, but I met women who were coming in to be the next wave of VISTA volunteers who wanted to start a women&#8217;s birth control and abortion referral and information service.
MK: And what year was that?
SB: This was like 1970.
MK: Okay, so pretty radical.
SB: Abortion had been legalized in New York State but prior to that women had to go Puerto Rico, to illegal abortion clinics, the coat hanger was a symbol, or to Japan. If women had money they would fly all the way to Japan for an abortion. So when New York State&#8211;. So we were in Massachusetts, which is very close to New York State. We were able to refer women to abortion clinics in New York if they needed an abortion and we set up this birth control counseling. Well there were two publications that came out during this time. One was the Boston Women&#8217;s Health Book Collective and they put out a book called Our Bodies, Ourselves. You know that book, right?
MK: Yes. [Laughs] I do.
SB: So it came out, and it was a stapled-together little newsprint, maybe forty pages, and it talked about our bodies, ourselves&#8211;-radical. I had never, ever experienced anything like this, and most women hadn&#8217;t, I think. Look, here&#8217;s how your body works. Here&#8217;s how you can not get pregnant. And in the [19]60s the birth control pill came out, so that was also part of this whole revolution where women had control over their reproductive health. Then there was a book called the Birth Control Handbook, I believe, and that was from McGill University, and that talked about all the birth control methods that were around. So we had those two resources to use when counseling women who came to this little free birth control and abortion counseling service in North Adams, Massachusetts. That is how I decided that I was passionate about women controlling our own bodies and about working with healthy women. So I was never interested in being a nurse or a doctor or working with sick people. I thought it was absolutely incredible and wonderful to think about a healthy person and how a woman can stay healthy through understanding our bodies, and then at the same time I&#8217;m learning about yoga and I&#8217;m learning about healthy eating and I&#8217;m learning about all of this. So to me it was a wonderful, heady time.   My husband at the time was going to be drafted and we were trying to make a decision whether we were going to run away to Canada or whether he was going to go to jail because he wasn&#8217;t going to go&#8211;. Both of us were so against the Vietnam War. Then something called the lottery came along where you got picked and you got a number and a list and if you had a low enough number, or a high enough number, you weren&#8217;t going to be drafted, so he won that lottery. All of a sudden, we didn&#8217;t have to worry about him going to jail or us moving to Canada, which we didn&#8217;t want to do, and that meant that he could apply to graduate school, because we both graduated from our colleges. At the time right when I graduated I got pregnant with my first child, so that was 1972.   So he chose as his graduate school the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and he went into a curriculum in ecology, so he was in a PhD program in ecology. We moved down here with our baby, who was about four months old at the time. We moved to North Carolina, we lived out in the country, and I was lonely and bored, very lonely and very bored. We joined a baby daycare co-op and I set type at the Chapel Hill newspaper a little bit but basically I was not knowing what I wanted to do, and I heard about this field called public health that I had never even heard of before. I looked into it and I went and I met with the professors in the Department of Health Education and I thought, &#8220;This is a way for me to pursue my interest in the women&#8217;s movement and in women&#8217;s health. I can do public health.&#8221; Public health is about keeping the public healthy and a lot of public health is focused on empowerment and organization of low income and un-empowered people and health promotion.   So by that time I had been in groups of women, I had been in consciousness-raising groups, I had been in Lamaze. That was another revolution in the women&#8217;s health movement, prepared childbirth and taking control of your body when you&#8217;re pregnant and having babies, insisting on not having a lot of intervention, insisting on being taught about breastfeeding, and at that time that was really radical. My mother and my mother-in-law could not figure out why in the world you would want a father to be present at the birth of their baby. No men would want to ever have to see that. And why do you want to breastfeed when it&#8217;s so much easier to bottle feed, that kind of thing. So that was also a revolutionary thing for me and very empowering, being pregnant with both of my children and being in control of the birth and the breastfeeding and all of that, and then taking that passion and background and starting my master&#8217;s in public health program here at UNC, where I focused on the women&#8217;s health movement as much as possible.   There was also something called the Human Sexuality Information and Counseling Center through the Student Union, and that was graduate students who had started that, so that was similar work where students could go for counseling on sexual issues. Then there was a course in the school of public health on sexuality that I helped to get graduate students to help to lead small groups. We had a women&#8217;s health collective of women from different departments in the public health graduate school, and we actually taught medical students how to do pelvic exams. We were like the patients and we helped them learn how to do pelvic exams. There was something called the Women&#8217;s Self-Help Movement where everybody had a speculum and you looked at your own cervix, and it was like this is not anything to be ashamed of. This is where every person in the world comes from. We all come from a woman&#8217;s body, and yet there was so much shame about that. So, all of that was going on at that time.  MK: Wow. [Laughs]  SB: I know.  MK: That&#8217;s a lot of really, really great stuff. So can you tell me a little more about the work that you were doing at this time when you were in the school of public health, or what your experience was like there?  SB: Yes. Well it was a really hard experience because I had a baby and I had a husband who was in a graduate program. He was getting a PhD, I was getting a master&#8217;s, and our baby was about one when I started that program, so that was difficult, and we didn&#8217;t have any money. We had food stamps and we struggled a lot. But the fact was that I was working with a group of other women who were also in the same exact mindset of women&#8217;s bodies, women being in control of our bodies, so that was a fabulous experience for me. I wrote my master&#8217;s thesis, I think it was called &#8220;Health Education and the Women&#8217;s Health Movement,&#8221; and it was about how various aspects of health education were incorporated and used in the women&#8217;s movement as organizing tools. So when people think about health education they think about brochures and pamphlets and books, and there was certainly that, but there was also the organizing. In health education, community organizing was at that time and still is a lot of the focus of the behavior health education program, so I wrote my thesis on that.  MK: Can you tell us a little about what was in the thesis?  SB: Oh my gosh.  MK: It&#8217;s probably been a little while [Laughs] since you last looked at it.   SB: It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve looked at it but I have a copy, and there&#8217;s&#8211;. I have a lot of this stuff&#8211;. When I retired a year and a half ago, I packed up all this stuff out of my office and it&#8217;s all packed up in boxes, but I was thinking before you came, Mary, that it would be cool for me to show you some of these archives. I actually sent, when I was&#8211;. That&#8217;s the dog running around. Do you hear him?  MK: [Laughs] Yeah.  SB: [Laughs] When I was packing up my boxes I found some old radical feminist literature and I mailed it off to Joey [Fink], so she&#8217;s got some of that stuff.  MK: That&#8217;s so cool.  SB: But it wasn&#8217;t a research paper. It was mostly a survey of the women&#8217;s health movement and how health education and education was used, so much empowerment. There he is.  MK: Aw!  SB: Mary wants to see him.   MK: So cute! [Pause]   SB: I can&#8217;t believe he just left him out there. Oh, well. [Laughs] Okay, I&#8217;m sorry.  MK: No, that&#8217;s okay.   SB: When you were first introducing what you were doing, I wanted to tell you this important thing about my undergraduate. So I dropped out of the University of Florida and I was working with welfare mothers, which was my first experience working with low income women.  MK: Was that with the VISTA volunteers?  SB: Yes.  MK: Okay. I was going to ask you about that.  SB: You can ask me about the VISTA volunteers. I was getting my undergraduate degree and I took a class in sociology and we got to choose what we wanted to write about, and I wrote about the history of the women&#8217;s movement up until that point, up until like 1970, right, and doing all this research blew my mind. I was so excited about the feminist movement. And I remember, I took this paper home to Florida to my mother and I said, &#8220;Mom, this is going to rock your world,&#8221; or whatever expression we used at the time-- &#8220;This is going to really change your life.&#8221; So I&#8217;m looking at my mother as a traditional housewife and from my na&#239;ve perspective in my early twenties I&#8217;m like&#8211;. [Laughs] I&#8217;m thinking that my mother is going to become a feminist by reading my paper, which was a really stupid thing to think, but my mother wouldn&#8217;t even read it. She didn&#8217;t say anything negative about it, she just didn&#8217;t read it. She never read it and never said anything, and I was so disappointed because I thought, &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t every woman, every woman, everywhere, want to know about this and to be liberated&#8211;-it was women&#8217;s liberation&#8211;-to be liberated from these roles?&#8221; With my mother, my father made all the decisions, she followed him in his career, he got transferred from one Air Force base to another, and she was there just being his helpmate. But she didn&#8217;t want to hear anything else about it. In those days too people talked about bra burners, and I think that never really happened, it was a myth, but they made fun of women who were in the women&#8217;s liberation movement. So that was an interesting part where I really thought that I was going to save my mother&#8217;s life. [Laughs]   So that was a paper that I wrote as an undergraduate, and then I wrote my master&#8217;s paper on the women&#8217;s health movement, and I can find that paper, but I don&#8217;t know if you want to see it or not. I can probably find a copy of it.  MK: I would love to see it, but only if you don&#8217;t mind, only if it&#8217;s not a trouble for you.  SB: VISTA is still going on. It&#8217;s like AmeriCorps. You know AmeriCorps?  MK: Yes.  SB: So VISTA was called the domestic Peace Corps and it was where people volunteered for a year to work mostly with poverty reduction. So we did that for a year, year and a half, and then went back to college.   MK: So I&#8217;m wondering, do you remember what you were thinking, or do you remember experiencing these landmark occasions that we talk about now, like Roe v. Wade, Title IX, et cetera?  SB: Not Title IX, but Roe v. Wade was key because&#8211;. Yes, that was huge. I remember that very much because I was involved with the women&#8217;s counseling and all. Because I was at that point starting my family, I was pregnant and breastfeeding and have two children, my interest in women&#8217;s health was more on having babies at that point. And then I moved to the Philippines for a year and a half. I was just writing my thesis and I had a baby and a three-year-old, or a baby and a four-year-old at the time.  MK: So what year was that?  SB: So that was 1975.   MK: I saw also on your CV that you wrote a pamphlet called &#8220;The Morning After Treatment.&#8221;  SB: Yes!  MK: Is that like the same as the&#8211;?  SB: Yeah. Well, it was diethylstilbestrol, and it was probably a lot stronger then, but, yes, it was available through the student health service, and that was a project that I had to do. I think I had to do a health education something for graduate school, so I wrote that brochure, but then later on I wrote a book on pregnancy called the Complete Pregnancy Workbook. That was when I was working in the Department of Family Medicine.   MK: So when you were writing that, was&#8211;  SB: On the morning after treatment?  MK: &#8211;that like a&#8211;? Yeah. Was that a controversial issue, or do you remember what the&#8211;?  SB: I don&#8217;t remember it being so controversial, and it&#8217;s interesting. When you look&#8211;. In some ways there was more freedom than there is now to talk about sex in the [19]60s because the [19]60s was the free love, and the birth control pill had come out, and it was before AIDS. It was before Herpes was even known. So there was some acceptance of sex outside of marriage, and if you watch some shows on TV that were in the [19]70s it seems a lot more free, at least it does in such a conservative state as North Carolina, in such a fundamentalist state with religion.  MK: Yeah, I just thought that--, since it&#8217;s been so controversial today.  SB: I know, I know, and Mary, so this is something that could be seen as discouraging or else it&#8217;s just a lesson from history: We&#8217;re still fighting a lot of the same battles, and now it&#8217;s even moving backwards, and it&#8217;s very discouraging, because when I was your age we were fighting these battles and you think you&#8217;ve won them: the right to control your body, the right to access to birth control, the right to access to abortion, all of these things, equal pay for equal work. All of these things that should have been&#8211;. Those battles should have been won and over, we shouldn&#8217;t be talking about them anymore, and now it&#8217;s back again and that is discouraging.  MK: Yeah, it&#8217;s a constant fight.  SB: It&#8217;s constant. You can&#8217;t ever let your guard down.   MK: So if we could switch gears a little bit.  SB: Okay. Let me just check on my puppy. [Pause; transcription suspended until 24:08] Okay.  MK: So can we talk a little about all your various HOPE-related jobs?  SB: Yes.  MK: How did you get involved with that?  SB: Well my first job after I got my master&#8217;s degree&#8212;when we came back from the Philippines and I had two little kids&#8212;my first job was in the Department of Family Medicine, and there I was not working in women&#8217;s health and was a little bit frustrated but I was working with wellness and health promotion. So I kept doing that and for a few years wasn&#8217;t really focusing on women, but toward the end of the--. I don&#8217;t know, I worked there like twelve years. My funding was ending and a job came available through the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention to develop a women&#8217;s reproductive health promotion program for blue collar workplaces. At that point I had published this book with two family doctors called the Complete Pregnancy Workbook, and I had had such a strong interest in women&#8217;s health, and here&#8217;s an opportunity to do something in blue collar workplaces working with low income women in North Carolina. I got hired to develop a program, it was called New Beginnings, and we worked in nine factories in rural North Carolina, bringing information, pre-conceptional health promotion, pre-natal, and post-partum, and some birth control, to blue collar women. And I worked with the occupational nurses and I developed a training manual for them and a program for them to implement in workplaces. So that was my first experience working in workplaces.   That funding ended, and because of my experience in workplaces. That funding ended and I got invited by a few women, who were just finishing their PhDs in public health, to write a grant that we called Health Works for Women, that was going to take health promotion to blue collar women in eastern North Carolina, and that was funded through the Centers for Disease Control for five years. So Health Works for Women addressed&#8211;. It wasn&#8217;t women&#8217;s health but it was women and their health, so it wasn&#8217;t reproductive health but it addressed smoking, exercise, healthy eating, and eventually stress, and that was a very successful program. We worked in nine workplaces and we had changes in diet&#8211;. We used a lay health advisor strategy so we trained women leaders within the workplace from all aspects, from frontline workers to secretaries to managers. We trained them on these areas of health that we were addressing and then they spread the word to other people, we also did computer tailored health messages in those workplaces, and we were successful. So the Centers for Disease Control said they wanted people who were doing those grants&#8212;instead of quitting that grant, writing up the papers, publishing the papers, and then moving on to a different grant&#8212;they wanted us to build on our successes in the communities that we had worked with and what we had learned and build another program, and that they wanted us to do something called community based participatory research.   So that was probably 1998. So this project, Health Works for Women, was from 1993 to 1998, and then from 1998 to 2003 we expanded this program to work not just in workplaces but to work with communities, and we really started addressing stress more because we kept hearing from the focus groups and from women in the workplace that the main health issue they had was the stress of their lives. The stress that they talked about was not just from the jobs they had. They had blue collar jobs, but then when they went home they had another job. They had another full time job which was to take care of their husbands, their children, their husband&#8217;s mother, their sister, their church, and they had so much on their plates&#8211;-we called it the &#8220;struggle to juggle&#8221;&#8211;-that they said, well, the reason we smoke and the reason we&#8217;re obese and overweight and don&#8217;t exercise, it&#8217;s all about stress. We don&#8217;t have time [and] we&#8217;re so stressed. So we kept hearing this issue of stress from women, and they were working but they were barely making ends meet. But they did have health insurance through their workplaces and they did have paid vacation, and people in the [19]90s--. If two people in a family worked in a manufacturing plant, they made enough money to send their kids to North Carolina state schools and they made enough money to buy a house. Those were pretty good jobs, those blue collar jobs.   So we went to do the second program and about a year into it, the development of the materials and the&#8211;. You had to recruit workplaces, which takes a lot of time. In research recruiting subjects or recruiting organizations to work with you is always very time-consuming, so we spent months and months. We spent a year getting ready to start this program in twelve workplaces in four counties in eastern North Carolina. It was called Health Works for Women/Health Works in the Community, and one year into it, Hurricane Floyd hit eastern North Carolina, so that was 1999. It flooded several of the manufacturing plants that we were working with, a lot of roads were flooded, people couldn&#8217;t get to work; it was the biggest disaster to ever hit North Carolina up to that point. Some people were killed and a lot of livestock were killed. There&#8217;s pictures of carcasses of hogs floating.   So, I remember really clearly on a Sunday morning opening the News &amp; Observer and looking at these pictures and reading about&#8211;. These are the towns that we&#8211;. This was where we were working, and we were over there recruiting these companies and getting ready to start a program on eating healthy and physical activity and all of these lovely things, but these are people that can&#8217;t get to work, and people were stranded, particularly in the Hispanic community because there hadn&#8217;t been any organized effort or way to get the word out to them through their own communication channels. So I called the director of the center, Alan Cross. I called the principal investigator, Marci Campbell, on Sunday morning and I was like, &#8220;What are we going to do? This is terrible, not just for our project but for the people that we know there, that we&#8217;ve been working with for a year, the health departments and the people at the migrant health centers.&#8221;   So on Monday I started calling them and they said, &#8220;Well, we really need diapers, we need food, we need water. No one&#8217;s coming forward to do this.&#8221; So I started collecting money from the exercise classes I was teaching at the senior center and from people I worked with. We didn&#8217;t even have receipts or anything. We just had envelopes, we were getting checks and money, and we went to K-Mart and Food Lion and we filled up vans and station wagons full of stuff and drove it over there and distributed it through the Migrant Health Center, which is now a community health center in Newton Grove in Sampson County. And that act of us doing that and then going to the community advisors and calling a meeting and saying&#8211;. We said to them, &#8220;Look. We understand if you don&#8217;t want to continue with this program. It seems like healthy eating is not going to be your priority right now when you&#8217;re flooded. What do you want us to do?&#8221; They basically said, &#8220;We still want that program, that&#8217;s still important to all of us, but we really need something to address this incredible level of stress that&#8217;s going on in this community, particularly violence against women, so intimate partner violence. All kinds of violence [were] increasing.&#8221; This is what they told us, and then the stress of not knowing what&#8217;s going to happen. People were called in to where they actually got waders, rubber boots, to go in and shovel mud and muck out of their factories so that people could get back to work.   So we went, those of us working at the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, we called the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which was our funding agency, and we said, &#8220;Look. We&#8217;ve got this big issue here. We don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221; They brought down some leaders and we took them on a tour of eastern North Carolina and they met people who were affected by the flood and they saw areas that were affected by the flood, spent a day just talking to people, and they went back and found, they call it &#8220;shopping money&#8221; in grantsmanship, and they found a piece of money. Part of it was from the injury prevention, which focused on violence against women, and we got a grant, another grant to add on to our Health Works for Women/Health Works in the Community grant, and we called it Health Works After the Flood. In that one we added a big component on stress, on post-traumatic stress&#8211;-which a lot of people had in eastern North Carolina&#8211;-post-traumatic stress, stress in the workplace, intimate partner violence prevention, training managers and people in the workplace to recognize signs with women, working really closely with the local domestic violence agencies, particularly one called U Care in Clinton, in Sampson County. [We] became very close with the women who worked in that women&#8217;s shelter and women&#8217;s center, and focused for the next three years, in addition to the healthy eating and the exercise, focused&#8211;-and then the stress management that we were doing, which we were teaching great skills like deep breathing and all kinds of ways to manage your stress, but this was another whole level. So we did that project for three years, and we put on Women&#8217;s Empowerment Days at the local community colleges, and that was a turning point, those Women&#8217;s Empowerment Days, because&#8211;.  MK: What exactly were those? I&#8217;m sorry for interrupting. [Laughs]  SB: That&#8217;s fine. Those were&#8211;-. So the community advisors were telling us&#8211;-. This is the thing about community based participatory research. The people in the community a lot of times don&#8217;t want to do what the researchers in Chapel Hill want to do. We might say we want to do smoking cessation because smoking is the leading cause of death and you have a big smoking problem in this community. And they might say, &#8220;Well, sure, we know smoking&#8217;s bad for us, but we&#8217;re not really interested in quitting smoking and we don&#8217;t believe in pushing it,&#8221; and they did say that to us. What they said was &#8220;What we&#8217;re interested in&#8221;&#8211;-and this is when it first came up-&#8211;&#8220;is economic development.&#8221; And we went&#8211;-. I mean it&#8217;s what we did when we heard from the community about intimate partner violence. We said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have that experience.&#8221; So we brought in researchers from UNC who were experts on intimate partner violence and we connected with the domestic violence agencies. So with the economic piece we were like, &#8220;Okay, well we have resources at UNC. We have lots of people at the business school in various kinds of development efforts who know about the economic piece and some of the things that we could do.&#8221;   So we put on this day where we had part of the day, I mean throughout the day, we served only healthy food. We had exercise breaks. We had stress management and nutrition workshops. But we also had people come in from the unemployment office and have a table there with stuff about jobs. We had people come in from the&#8211;. We were in the community college but they had a table telling women how to go back to school and get your GED, how to go back to school and get a degree. Then the domestic violence agency had a thrift shop and we had a fashion show with clothes that they had that you could use: &#8220;Look, this ensemble is only three dollars and you could wear this for a job interview.&#8221; So we combined the economic piece and the health piece for the first time.   We did those two Women&#8217;s Empowerment Days, one in Duplin County at James Sprunt Community College and one in Sampson County at Sampson Community College. Being researchers, we wrote an evaluation form for all the women. Oh, and for that Women&#8217;s Empowerment Day, women who were on welfare&#8211;-Work First&#8211;-had to show that they were looking for a job, and they got to come to that day&#8211;-. It was all free. We didn&#8217;t charge anybody anything. They got to come to that day and count it [as looking] for a job because there were people there talking about jobs and getting a job, and they walked in&#8211;-there was a whole group of them&#8211;-and they were walking in and they looked like they were really pissed off that they had to be here. I&#8217;m always the one that taught the exercise breaks, so we were doing an exercise break, we have music on, we have pictures of them laughing. At the end of the day they were like, &#8220;This was great! What a wonderful day!&#8221; And that was the first time that our projects ever combined, as I said, the economic piece and the health piece.   Well&#8211;-. [Brief interruption] So, in real life we don&#8217;t separate. People live their lives. They don&#8217;t think, &#8220;Oh, I have an economic piece of my life, I have a health piece of my life.&#8221; I mean it&#8217;s my life. It&#8217;s a holistic life that you&#8217;re living and a lot of times the economic has to take a priority, especially if you&#8217;re low income. You&#8217;re having to figure out how you&#8217;re going to buy the groceries and put gas in your car. So we combined those two. We did this evaluation and I added a question, an open-ended question, and it said, &#8220;When you think about your life in the future, how would you like it to be?&#8221; We got all those questions together, all these open-ended questions, a lot of women took the time to write answers, and they said, &#8220;I want to get a college degree. I want a good job. I want to show my kids that I can take care of them without a man.&#8221; Not one single person said, &#8220;I want to meet a rich man.&#8221;   MK: Yeah.  SB: Not one person said anything about what kind of car they wanted. They all wanted education, they wanted to be able to raise their children with dignity; those are the things they wanted. So that was like a kernel of the direction that we felt like we needed to go in with the future projects.   At the same time that that&#8217;s all going on, I went to a conference in St. Louis, I think it was a Prevention Centers conference, and I heard&#8211;-. I blanked on his name, but I heard this grand old man in public health speak. Leonard Syme. It&#8217;s S-y-m-e, Leonard Syme, and he&#8217;s famous for-&#8211;. One thing he&#8217;s famous for is there&#8217;s the Berkman-Syme Stress Index, I think. Anyway, he&#8217;s probably a social psychologist. So he was talking about all these projects that we did in public health where we&#8217;re trying to make a change&#8211;-people eating fruits and vegetables and adding minutes a day to their exercise program&#8211;-and he was like, &#8220;We&#8217;re not making any impact. What we really need to be talking about is hope. We need to measure hope. It&#8217;s all about hope. If people don&#8217;t have hope then they&#8217;re not going to make any of these changes. Why would you? Why would you quit smoking? If you enjoy smoking and it&#8217;s helping you with stress, you have no hope for the future anyway.&#8221; Being middle class and educated, it&#8217;s a hard concept for us to even imagine not having any hope for the future, but if you&#8217;re poor it&#8217;s pretty much impossible to get out of poverty in this country with what&#8217;s going on.   So I heard that and I thought, &#8220;Hope, wow,&#8221; and at the same time there was a school principal in eastern North Carolina, in Duplin County, and she got in a lot of trouble from the community because she said&#8211;-. At one point she was like, &#8220;Our kids have no hope. The only thing they can hope for is to do like their parents do and work at the McDonald&#8217;s on I-40 over there. There&#8217;s no hope for them. There&#8217;s no jobs here,&#8221; da, da, da, and the parents were like, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with working at McDonald&#8217;s,&#8221; which wasn&#8217;t her point. Her point was, &#8220;Is that what you wish for, for your kids? Is that the highest level?&#8221; And it&#8217;s really true that it&#8217;s really hard in [eastern North Carolina.] So we got this idea. We had to write another grant, we were finishing the Health Works After the Flood, Health Works for Women, we were finishing that project, gathering all our data, and the factories were all closing. Basically manufacturing in eastern North Carolina went from being where everybody worked to now being there&#8217;s very few jobs in manufacturing, and no other jobs came in to take over.   MK: And why was&#8211;-?   SB: Why was that? That was because of something called NAFTA, which is the North American Free Trade Act, which pretty much sucked-&#8211;. Almost all the jobs in textiles and manufacturing that could went to Third World countries. So those jobs left, the economy had tanked, and the people who own the manufacturing plants, they only go places where they can get the most out of the people that work for them. Most of them are not community oriented. So they left and they closed down the factories and people were laid off, and while we were ending that Health Works in the Community program factories were closing right and left. We didn&#8217;t know if we&#8217;d even be able to-&#8211;. Most of the companies that I worked with are long gone. I worked with I think I&#8217;ve counted twenty-five different manufacturing plants over the time that I worked in those projects. They&#8217;re gone. Their jobs are not there. So I mentioned to you that those jobs, people could send their kids to college, because it was a steady paycheck and they had health insurance. Now those jobs are gone and people are either unemployed or they&#8217;re doing really menial jobs. They&#8217;re working part time at Wal-Mart; they&#8217;re working at McDonald&#8217;s; they&#8217;re cleaning houses.   So we had this hope, the principal in Duplin County talked about hope, I heard this talk about hope, and I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;We really need to take what we&#8217;ve learned from the two previous projects, add this whole component of hope, but have this project focus on economics and poverty as well as health.&#8221; Because they really go hand in hand, because it&#8217;s really, really difficult to be healthy if you&#8217;re poor. It&#8217;s not impossible but it&#8217;s really hard and you have to be heroic to move beyond that poverty and eat healthy and exercise and do all those things that we take for granted. So HOPE stands for Health, Opportunities, Partnerships, and Empowerment, and with the HOPE projects we used HOPE Circles, so this is going back to the beginnings of the women&#8217;s movement, the consciousness raising groups. Circles of women: think about sewing circles and quilting circles and women gathering in circles always. A circle is powerful because it&#8217;s never-ending and it&#8217;s egalitarian, and then talking circles, with Native Americans. So with the HOPE projects we, for the first time, really focused on working with Native American women in eastern North Carolina, and there&#8217;s a high minority African American population there anyway, so most of the women in the project are African American and Native American. Some are white.   But we did circles of women, we trained lay leaders from the community to lead the circles, and they did interactive empowering activities around healthy eating, weight management, exercise, stress management, and starting a small business on your own, going back to school, getting a better job--so the economic piece--and financial literacy. So HOPE Circles did that, and&#8211;-. What was I going to say? So as this is going on, we started getting attention from the Centers for Disease Control and we got this idea that we would actually start a women&#8217;s business as part of our project, so we weren&#8217;t just going to talk about economic empowerment, we were going to start a business. We started a project called Threads of Hope, which was a small conference bag manufacturing enterprise, and we used the back of a-&#8211;.  A seamstress in Wallace, Mae Tuggle, had her own drapery and upholstery shop so she had the heavy duty sewing machines and she had actually already taught sewing to women in community colleges, and a lot of the women that we worked with were laid-off textile workers. So we called this Threads of Hope and we had a design made. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen this. There was a website, and it&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve looked at all this. I don&#8217;t know if I have one of these bags. I must have a bag still.   So we made these high quality conference bags with this beautiful logo, Threads of Hope. We had a design contest, and the design actually represented women in circles, and the circles are connected to represent community, and there are four colors of women, so there was white, black, Hispanic, and Native American. There were four women together dancing. And it was Threads of Hope, and we actually sold-&#8211;. We got contracts with public health meetings and we sold thousands and thousands of bags. We had Ms. Tuggle in charge of it and she hired a couple of women and we distributed them, marketed them, and all, but then in 2008 the economy crashed. People had to even cancel confrontations and then those conferences that still went on, they could not afford&#8211;-because our bags cost like fifteen dollars each. You can get bags from China for two dollars each. So that business tanked, along with a lot of other things in the economy. We actually got a nonprofit designation for that business, but one thing and another, the funding has decreased.   So anyway, we had Threads of Hope--. So there&#8217;s all these HOPE projects or spinoffs, and then that project-&#8211;. Oh, so this is the economic piece. So, let&#8217;s take a little break. I&#8217;m going to get a sip of water.  MK: Okay, that&#8217;s fine. Do you want me to turn this off?  SB: Yeah. [Break in recording]  MK: Okay.  SB: Okay, so we had these HOPE Circles and we had started a business and we&#8217;re combining the whole aspect of poverty reduction, trying to help women move out of poverty by starting small businesses. That was a big part of what we were looking at. But we tried to get loans for the small businesses and we tried to get grants and we come to find out, because we&#8217;re learning as we go, that most of the women that we worked with had really bad credit, of course, and didn&#8217;t have any real collateral to get a loan, and there&#8217;s really not money available for low income women to get loans to start businesses. Employment and business is one aspect of reducing poverty but--when we were doing research--there&#8217;s another whole aspect, which is assets, financial assets, and it&#8217;s something that I was really na&#239;ve about and a lot of people in the middle class are na&#239;ve about. If you think about family assets, I think many of us expect that we&#8217;re going to inherit a home, or if we&#8217;re not going to inherit some amount of money that at least our families are going to use assets to put us through school. We&#8217;re going to have an education, which is an asset. So home ownership is an asset, retirement accounts, savings accounts, education, those things are assets that for the most part poor people don&#8217;t have. Even if they have a steady income, if they don&#8217;t have savings and they don&#8217;t own a home and they don&#8217;t have an education there&#8217;s no real chance for their kids, it&#8217;s very, very difficult. It&#8217;s a generational thing.   So we started looking at, what are other ways to help women out of poverty besides employment and businesses? And it&#8217;s asset development. It&#8217;s getting those assets. So we found out about something called an IDA, which is an Individual Development Account, which is used as a poverty reduction tool. It&#8217;s run by the Labor Department for the most part, or it&#8217;s run by Self-Help Credit Unions and that kind of thing, and it&#8217;s a matched savings. So women get into this&#8211;-and it&#8217;s usually women. Most times it&#8217;s not closed to men but it&#8217;s usually women who do it. You get in this program and you agree to go to financial literacy education and to save money toward a goal. The goal could be home ownership. It could be education. It could be paying off debts. It could be some of those kinds of things. Then at the end of the program you get a matched amount. If you stay in the program and you meet your goals you get a match. So we wrote a grant to the National Institutes of Health-&#8211;and this is at the time with the economic stimulus that Obama was doing, so Obama had been elected-&#8211;and it was called a Challenge Grant. We said, &#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s take everything we&#8217;ve learned about the social determinants of health.&#8221; And that&#8217;s the phrase that you use when you talk about poverty impacting health. It&#8217;s a social determinant. Racism is a social determinant, sexism, violence. Those are all social determinants of health versus just medical care, what you eat, disease kinds of things. So we were addressing social determinants of health.   We wrote a grant to the stimulus grant to do a matched savings where women could save up to six hundred dollars and at the end of the program we would match it with twelve hundred dollars and then they could use that to for instance, say a woman was really interested in mending clothes and having a little tailoring repair thing, but she needed a better sewing machine. So she could buy that with $1200, so she could save for that and then she could start her business, or a laptop to work on her business. One woman in Robeson County already had chickens and eggs but she used her matched savings to buy better chicken coops to do her organic egg business. So we got-&#8211;. This was like a one in--. I want to say ten thousand people applied and only one&#8211;-. There were a few of these grants and it was very, very competitive, and we actually got one of these grants to do HOPE accounts for women, to do this matched savings program.   So that was the last project that was ending in August of 2011, it was actually carried forward a little more when I retired, and they&#8217;re still doing qualitative assessment of that program. But that was a radical idea to combine the health&#8211;-. We did the HOPE Circles, we had health, and we did financial literacy, and we did savings. So that was my final grant that I wrote, that project.  MK: Wow. That was a lot. [Laughs]  SB: Yeah, it was a lot.  MK: Were you ever part of the HOPE Circles?  SB: Well, yeah, sure. I mean, they were in eastern North Carolina. We did the training. We went and trained the circle leaders and then I would get invited to do the exercise component, physical activity, then I would go and do a more&#8211;-. We would sit in for some of it. Yeah.  MK: What was that like? Do you remember anything in particular that stood out to you?  SB: Well, what women always say when women get together like that, is how empowering it is. In the very, very beginning with consciousness-raising, the phrase was &#8220;personal is political,&#8221; and that is an incredible statement. I remember in the late &#8217;60s feeling that, &#8220;You mean I&#8217;m not the only one? I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s felt this way?&#8221; And guess what? It&#8217;s not just about an individual woman. It&#8217;s a whole system. I think these HOPE Circles did the same thing for women, where they would get together and they would say, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve had this problem with the banks too. They&#8217;ve treated me this way.&#8221; So what can we do with banks to help, because banks discriminate against low income women, right? So there was that, and then there was the sharing of the personal stories. A lot of women have stories, sad stories of abuse, rape, violence. Many, many women have been battered and they would share those and we would hear about that. I know there was one leader training that I was [at] with Marci Campbell and me&#8211;-Marci was the PI of the projects&#8211;-and we were all crying because women were talking about these stories. But for them, then they would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s so wonderful to have a place to go and be able to say whatever you want to say and not be judged for it.&#8221; There was a vow of confidentiality in the circles, and that was one of the major ground rules, is nothing goes out of the circle. So it was powerful in many ways, and it&#8217;s hard to quantify that kind of thing with surveys, but then with the qualitative piece where women can say what it&#8217;s meant to them, it&#8217;s powerful.  MK: Absolutely.   SB: Yeah. So I do want to say that Marci Campbell was&#8211;-. She was just getting her PhD in 1993 and she was on the project from the beginning and she was a brilliant woman. She was the principal investigator and I was the project manager and then the project director for these projects over sixteen or seventeen years, and just a couple months after I retired she died of colon cancer. She was fifty-nine. So all of these projects really-&#8211;. Her thumbprint is on all of them. She really supported them and she and I had so many great ideas together and with the team of women that we had at UNC and then the team of women in eastern North Carolina--with those two teams we had what we called power team meetings every week or two for like a half a day. We would go and we would hash things out and do the work. We would always go to eastern North Carolina and work with the women there to run the projects. Then we had community advisory or community action council meetings once a month, also in eastern North Carolina, and we would have dinner meetings and we would go through the work of the projects and get ideas from them. It was an amazing experience to work with all the people in eastern North Carolina that I worked with.  MK: So you said those are like the consciousness-raising groups that you were a part of earlier&#8211;-  SB: Yeah.  MK: &#8211;-and when you were talking about that earlier I really wanted to ask you what they were like. Can you--?  SB: Well, let me see if I can remember, because it&#8217;s a long time ago. I remember we would sit together and we would often have a topic, and topics would be your parents, or how you were raised to think about sports, sex. I know I remember one evening it was about sexual abuse, and I had not thought about it since I was a child, but when I was twelve I was abused by a friend of my mom and dad&#8217;s, and it was horrible. It was traumatic. I had repressed it, and because we were talking about it in this group I remembered it, but I didn&#8217;t remember-&#8211;. I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of it anymore because every single woman in the group, every one, had either been raped or abused in some way, every woman. One friend of mine was talking about she was hitchhiking in her hometown and this guy that she knew picked her up and raped her, and I don&#8217;t think she even reported it. But it was everybody, so that&#8217;s such a good example of &#8220;the personal is political,&#8221; because when women are abused or raped, often we are ashamed of ourselves and we hide it, and my parents certainly never-&#8211;. I never told my parents. I never opened my mouth. I just turned into this really angry little girl for a couple of years and I hated my mother, because part of the way that I was raised in those days, adults were right and children weren&#8217;t. You respected adults and you weren&#8217;t taught, like kids are now, that it&#8217;s okay to tell if someone does something. But that was that meeting that night that I remembered it and I went through&#8211;-. It raised my consciousness about women and about experience.   MK: That&#8217;s really powerful.  SB: It was really powerful, and I don&#8217;t remember all of the-&#8211;. I do remember processing whether or not I was going to have an abortion with my first child, and I actually knew I wasn&#8217;t going to. I mean I was happily married and I always wanted children and I didn&#8217;t get pregnant on purpose, but I remember talking about that. There are things I want-&#8211;. And you&#8217;re weighing it, it was an option, but then I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have the baby. I want this baby.&#8221; But it was like there wasn&#8217;t anything you couldn&#8217;t talk about, and that was the first time in my life, Mary, that I could talk without feeling ashamed of things.   MK: That&#8217;s important.  SB: It&#8217;s powerful. It&#8217;s powerful.  MK: So, that&#8217;s amazing. You said that was how you got started with the women&#8217;s movement, and I know what you were talking about earlier with abuse and violence relates again to the work you were doing after Hurricane Floyd. I was interested in, when you were talking about that, how-&#8211;. I think you briefly mentioned it, the connection between&#8211;-.  SB: Intimate partner violence?  MK: Yeah.  SB: So, I know when I was talking I was saying so many things at one time, [Laughs], but&#8211;-.  MK: No. [Laughs] I mean I was interested in all of them.  SB: So after Hurricane Floyd we called together our community advisors. It was in Goldsboro, in Wayne County, and we were at a Mexican restaurant, and we actually have a picture of that first meeting. So these are like maybe twelve people who we&#8217;d been&#8211;. They&#8217;d been helping us figure out how to start this program and how to recruit the industries and everything, and then the flood happened and we said to them, &#8220;How can we help? What can we do?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We&#8217;re really concerned about&#8211;-. We&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of stories about violence, particularly child abuse and intimate partner violence. We&#8217;ve just anecdotally been hearing these stories.&#8221; And we said, I mentioned, &#8220;We are not experts on that area, but we certainly have resources at UNC to bring in, and what could we do? We can still work through the workplaces, because there&#8217;s thousands of women in the workplaces, and there are great programs about domestic violence coming to work.&#8221; Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that rare for a boyfriend or a husband to stalk his wife or girlfriend at work or the parking lot, guns and things like that.   So that&#8217;s where we were able to bring in people from UNC, women from UNC, and bring in the local domestic violence agencies to help us figure out how to do these programs, and some of the stories that women would say about the inequality in their relationships, like focus groups in the&#8211;-. In 1993 there were a couple of these comments in these focus groups that were&#8211;-. We joked about them forever. One woman said, &#8220;A man&#8217;s only going to do what a man wants to do. If my husband feels like helping me, he will. If he doesn&#8217;t, he won&#8217;t.&#8221; And women would say, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come home from work all day, standing up on the production line. My husband&#8217;s sitting in the chair. I walk in the door. He&#8217;s been sitting there, watching TV all day, and the first thing he says to me is, &#8216;What&#8217;s for dinner?&#8217;&#8221; Then one woman said, &#8220;My husband makes me cut his hair. He won&#8217;t even go to the barbershop. I have to cut my husband&#8217;s hair.&#8221; And one woman said, &#8220;A man&#8217;s only good for two things, sperm and lifting heavy objects, and nowadays you don&#8217;t even need him for sperm.&#8221; [Laughter] So there were some great quotes. But that was the life that these women had, whereas the women&#8217;s movement, all of us had been through the women&#8217;s movement and we weren&#8217;t living those lives as much.  MK: And these are the women in eastern North Carolina.   SB: They still were pretty much under the--, whatever their&#8211;-. If they had a husband or a boyfriend they still had that double standard, a lot of them, and that was twenty years [ago],1993. But I always had this experience over and over and over again, because I would drive to eastern North Carolina. I drove to eastern North Carolina hundreds of times during my career. Sometimes I would go three or four times a week, sometimes I would just go once a week, but I was always going over there for meetings in workplaces. So I&#8217;m there where it&#8217;s hard to get healthy food, the country roads are [terrible], it&#8217;s very dangerous, there&#8217;s no resources, there&#8217;s just poverty and violence, and I would drive back and I&#8217;d come back to Carrboro, to shop at Weaver Street, to a husband who cooks. I live on a walking trail. I don&#8217;t have to do anything, basically. It&#8217;s not hard for me to be healthy. It&#8217;s not hard for me at all because I have access to healthy food, and healthy restaurants, and a husband who cooks, and trails, and I&#8217;d be over there and I&#8217;d come back and it would be like I&#8217;d be coming from a Third World country to home. Then you think about the women there who have all of that to deal with, that&#8217;s their lives, and most of them are obese and they have all the health issues that come with that. They have diabetes and heart disease and they have difficulty walking, and it&#8217;s not through any fault of their own. It&#8217;s just the chance of where they were born.   MK: So that was probably a huge thing to learn from.  SB: Well, it&#8217;s like all my life I&#8217;ve been struck by that first time that one of the welfare mothers that we were organizing-&#8211;. There was something called the National Welfare Organization. Have you heard of it?   MK: Yeah. We learned about it in Joey&#8217;s class.  SB: So we were part of the National Welfare Organization, and these are all these poor women, standing up, and saying, &#8220;I have a right to a standard of living that I can raise my kids,&#8221; and them saying to me, &#8220;Well you&#8217;re rich, you don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; and me going, &#8220;Rich? I&#8217;ve never thought of myself as rich.&#8221; But compared to them I was rich and it&#8217;s the same compared to the women that I worked with in eastern North Carolina. Learning about the financial aspects, assets and savings and banking and all of those things, you see that once you&#8217;re poor the whole system comes down on your head and it&#8217;s just about impossible to get out of it.  MK: So what else, if anything else, do you remember learning from your experience working with women in low income areas?  SB: I&#8217;m going to turn the air conditioning off, or up a little bit. Just one second. I&#8217;m starting to get cold. [Pause] I think this is the same lesson to me, which is that it&#8217;s the system that needs to be changed. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so happy to see so many people going to Raleigh every Monday for the Moral Mondays. The system, it was already difficult but with this legislature it&#8217;s just making everything so much harder. It&#8217;s the way things work, and to impact lives and health it&#8217;s poverty that has to be changed, and it&#8217;s the dual system that we have in this country, which is getting worse and worse. We saw that in the election with the one percent and Romney and all of that.   MK: What do you mean by the &#8220;dual system?&#8221;  SB: Well, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  MK: Okay. That&#8217;s what I thought. [Laughs]  SB: Yeah.   MK: [Pause] So I had a ton of questions written down and you have talked about so many things. [Laughs] Hmm. Oh, I did want to ask what you remember thinking about other progressive social movements that were going on when you were getting involved with the feminist movement.  SB: Well, certainly supportive. I mean they&#8217;re all&#8211;. What is it: A rising tide floats all boats? I think they&#8217;re all important, the civil rights movement, and feminism, and the environmental movement, social justice, and living through the times that I&#8217;ve lived through, I see that things can really change. Things have changed a lot. Things that you as a young woman would never accept, when I was a child were accepted. Have you ever watched Mad Men? [Laughs]  MK: Yeah. I&#8217;ve been watching that a lot recently, actually. [Laughs]  SB: And that&#8217;s the way it was.  MK: And that&#8217;s insane to me.
SB: It&#8217;s crazy.
MK: That it&#8217;s accurate is insane to me.
SB: It&#8217;s crazy, right, and that is the way it was, and that&#8217;s our lifetime. That was the [19]60s, right? I was born in 1947 and my mother was one of those women. She didn&#8217;t work. But from a health perspective a woman holding her baby with a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, [Laughs] or there was a scene where they had a picnic and they just got up and left all their trash.
MK: I remember that. [Laughs]
SB: Remember that? [Laughs] You were like-&#8211;. [Gasps] Not everyone has changed but certainly a huge amount has changed, and with&#8211;. We have more to go. I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;ve made it. There&#8217;s still sexism and racism and all of those things, but I feel optimistic because things have changed so much, and I think I was a much better parent because of being a hippy. I mean I never said that, but I felt like I was a hippy. I was pretty straight because I got married and I had children and I went to graduate school. I never &#8220;dropped out&#8221; but I certainly had that-&#8211;. That was the culture, which was so much more free than my mom and dad. My mother and father had these ideas that didn&#8217;t make any sense at all, about a lot of things in the world: Well this is just the way it&#8217;s always been done. The hippy movement and the cultural revolution changed that. Just because that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s always been done. I mean I rejected&#8211;-. My upbringing was Christian and I rejected that because it was during the civil rights movement and I said, &#8220;This kind of Christianity that says it&#8217;s okay to segregate churches, that says it&#8217;s okay to segregate schools, to me that&#8217;s not a religion that I want to have anything to do with.&#8221; But up until that point people didn&#8217;t question it. They said, &#8220;That&#8217;s just the way it is&#8221;. My parents were racist, and they weren&#8217;t bad people. That was just the way it was.   So I think, yes, all the movements are connected, but in the women&#8217;s movement-&#8211;. In the beginning with the radical movement, the anti-war movement and all those things, women were supposed to be in the kitchen making coffee, you&#8217;ve probably read about that too, and, wait a minute. How can you be talking about social justice for other people but not for women? And the environmental movement to me has been really important. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s pretty weak right now. And certainly North Carolina is moving backwards in every direction it could possibly move. It&#8217;s really distressing. But as a child we probably could never imagine having a black President, and a black First Lady, and a black family, proud to be black, and it&#8217;s just-&#8211;. You could not imagine it. My parents were-&#8211;. My father was anti-Catholic, and Jewish, and I&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Why?&#8221; So, I feel lucky that I lived through all that and raised my kids in a different way.
MK: [Turns pages; laughs] I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m like really overwhelmed.
SB: [Laughs]
MK: So, let&#8217;s talk about the job that you do today, or the work that you do today.
SB: Oh, okay. Well I&#8217;m retired, so I&#8217;m not working, but I&#8217;m teaching senior fitness classes. I had always done that. I mean I&#8217;ve always been interested in health promotion and staying healthy and I&#8217;ve always believed that exercise is the most important way to do that, that we can do ourselves. So twenty-five years ago when I was working in the Department of Family Medicine we got a small grant to do a wellness program for retired people in the community and I went away and got trained to teach fitness to seniors and started teaching it and I never stopped, and I teach four exercise classes a week at senior centers. I teach my own program, which is called Salli&#8217;s Senior Workout, which is yoga, strength, dance, and then I teach something called Ageless Grace. I do that in the senior center in Hillsborough and I have some people from the adult daycare who have dementia that come over and participate in that class, which is wonderful, and that&#8217;s a chair exercise program that I got a certification in teaching [for]. Then I&#8217;m teaching a chair yoga class for seniors, so it&#8217;s yoga, you get a lot of benefits, and you either stand behind the chair or you sit in the chair or I do a sun salute where you use the chair. [Demonstrates] So instead of going to the floor for the sun salute you go to here and then you can do that.   So I teach those four classes, and I love it, and I have four grandchildren. You can look at their pictures over there when we&#8217;re through. I have four grandchildren and they all live in town, so one is almost eleven, one is nine and a half, and they&#8217;re boys, and those are my son&#8217;s children. Then my daughter has two little girls and one is six and one is four. So they&#8217;re all here and I spend as much time as I can with them. I think grandparents are really important. My grandparents were important to me but I was an Air Force brat so I didn&#8217;t get to spend as much&#8211;-. My grandmother and grandfather lived in Silver Spring, Maryland. My maternal grandmother lived with us some of the time. But I think grandparents can have a great positive impact on their&#8211;-. It takes some of the pressure off of the mom and dad. So since I retired I&#8217;ve been picking up my grandsons from school one day a week, and I&#8217;ve taught them to cook, and they have bicycles here, and I took them to a movie yesterday because it was pouring down rain, which was really fun. The four grandchildren and my daughter and some others of us are going to go away overnight this weekend and go to the mountains and go to a fruit orchard and pick cherries. I took my grandsons zip-lining last summer and then in January we took them skiing. So I feel like I&#8217;m so lucky to have them here. And then I have a lot of women friends that I walk with, do stuff with, go to the beach with sometimes.   That&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t really work. I&#8217;m retired. [Laughs] I love it. I worked for thirty-two and a half years at UNC, in just two departments, Family Medicine and the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, always in public health. And public health, I feel so fortunate to have found that field and to have been able to focus my whole career in public health and most of it in women&#8217;s health, but it&#8217;s such a positive. It&#8217;s filled with incredible people who really want to make a difference. People don&#8217;t go into public health if they don&#8217;t believe that they can make a difference and that there is a difference to be made. And I always wanted to have a career where I didn&#8217;t feel like I was taking but also giving.  MK: Well, that&#8217;s great.  SB: Yeah.  MK: So I think I just have one more question.  SB: Okay.  MK: Is there anything that you thought I&#8217;d ask that I didn&#8217;t ask, or anything you wanted to talk about that didn&#8217;t come up?  SB: I will probably think of things, because this is&#8211;-. I really wanted to help you&#8211;-. I wanted you to hear what it was like to be in the very beginning of the women&#8217;s movement. I wasn&#8217;t a leader in the women&#8217;s movement but I was really there. And I&#8217;m not sure I have enough memory, except that when I left Massachusetts after being exposed to that, and being in a consciousness-raising group, and being in prepared childbirth, and being in birth control and abortion counseling, and I came to North Carolina, I brought that passion with me and I was able to really search out and find other women in public health and do the women&#8217;s self-help and the women&#8217;s health work, because I brought it here with me so it came. I&#8217;m really grateful. So, I guess the answer was there weren&#8217;t any specific questions. I wish I had a little more memory of all of that and maybe now that we&#8217;ve talked about it, it will come up. Maybe I&#8217;ll dream about it or something. Sometimes I have dreams and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, yeah,&#8221; subconscious, in other words. [Pause] No, I can&#8217;t think of any questions.  MK: Well if you think of them you can email me.  SB: Okay. That would be great. Yeah.  MK: But if you&#8217;re-&#8211;. Are you-&#8211;?  SB: I&#8217;m finished.   MK: [Laughs]  SB: I do want to say that I&#8217;m really honored to have this chance to talk about it, and also that I hope-&#8211;. I mean I know you never really know how many lives you touch, which is a quote a nurse friend of mine said on a video about one of my programs. She said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sending information home to this man whose girlfriend is pregnant, and he said it had really helped her,&#8221; and she looked at the camera and she said, &#8220;You never really know how many lives you touch.&#8221; We try to figure that out in research but you can&#8217;t capture it all, and it&#8217;s been sad for me to see the lack of funding for some of my projects and I don&#8217;t know whether there&#8217;s going to be any that really continue. But I said that to Joey Fink and she said, &#8220;You know what? You have made an impact.&#8221; I hope that I&#8217;ve made a positive impact. I know that I&#8217;m making a positive impact through the exercise that I teach to seniors. I can see that every day. But these projects that you do for years and years, and you have these groups and then never see the women again, you just hope for the best, hope that they did make a difference, some little kernel.  MK: Thank you so much.  SB: You&#8217;re so welcome.  MK: I know this interview will make a difference, so thank you.  SB: And I&#8217;m honored. Thank you.
