KIERA BRINSON:  My name is Kiera Brinson and I&#8217;m interviewing Mayme Webb-Bledsoe. Did I say that right? At Smith Warehouse which is located at 114 South Buchanan Boulevard, Durham, North Carolina. It is Friday July 19th, 2013. Okay. So tell me a little bit about yourself.   MAYME WEBB-BLEDSOE:  All right.   KB:  Wherever that takes you.  MWB:  I am a native of Durham, North Carolina, an only child, was born to parents when they were in their early forties. So it was a different experience learning to live with multiple generations, mostly everybody being older than I. It was also an interesting time to grow up in Durham because it was around the [19]60s and in the early [19]70s, and it was lots of various types of energy around fighting for justice around race issues, in particular, and this was a gritty place to live. I mean people experimented and had lots of different ways of looking at life, and I was growing up in a village where there was a lot of opportunity for one to explore different kinds of efforts and interests. And so I&#8217;m from Durham, and I am very proud of that. I didn&#8217;t think I would always live here because I left for about twenty years and then I came back. And I&#8217;m glad that I did because I was able to spend the last days with my mother and father before they passed.   KB: I understand that your cousin is Reginald Glenn Blackston. Can you tell me a little bit about him?  MWB:  Yes, being an only child he was one of my first cousins, and you tend to use your cousins as your sisters and brothers when you don&#8217;t have them. We were, I felt, probably the closest of all the first cousins. I guess I looked up to him, [I] had a lot respect for him and his knowledge. He was much brighter than me, very well read and very sensitive as an individual to causes and specific issues.   KB:  How much older than you was he?  MWB:  He was probably four years older than I.  KB:  Okay. And you said you felt like y&#8217;all were the closest. How was his relationships with other cousins or family members?  MWB:  Well, he had his days where he was very black and white. And he never minced words. He was very articulate and very clear about what he wanted and what he didn&#8217;t want. I was closest to him primarily because of the relationship that he also had with my mom. And his ability for us to talk and communicate when there were times he could not do that with his own parents or others within our family around gay rights or other issues that he was dealing with, [his] sexuality. And probably another one of our cousins would probably see himself as another one that he was close to. It was probably me and Larry that he most identified with. And I can say that because we were probably the first that was introduced to his partners and other friends that he was close to.  KB:  So when did you first learn about his sexual preference?  MWB:  Probably in high school. He really wanted to be a dancer, and I don&#8217;t think he ever felt that his parents would understand that. He was very interested in the arts as I think about this. He also played a pipe organ. So when I would go with him to places even during his ordination when he became an Episcopal priest, he played in these cathedrals, and I mean music would come from everywhere. It was so beautiful it was as if you were in heaven listening to him play, and he played with such enthusiasm. And his feet would be going as fast as his hands, and his mother taught him how to play. Everybody was musicians in my family except for me and my mom. So we were always the happy invitee or the person that was in the audience cheering him on or enjoying the work. He was, as I said, also closer to Larry, and Larry was a musician. He still is. He&#8217;s a jazz musician in DC, and they were close because they were closest in age. They were also in the same city, and I was the country bumpkin that was Durham.   So in thinking back on that, I said that he probably came out with me when I was in high school. And didn&#8217;t matter to me, but I knew that there were issues within the family, particularly with his mom. His father would&#8217;ve been very open to it, but he never could bring himself to talk to his father about it either. And I know that because Uncle Sammy and I talked quite a bit about how we could make him comfortable enough that he could be who he wanted to be.  KB:  Do you feel like that&#8217;s one of the things that made him closer to your mom? What is it about your mom that made them so close versus with his own mother?  MWB: Yeah. Because his own mother was very black and white. Like he could (       ), she saw everything straight and narrow, and even when he became an Episcopal priest, even when he shared various stories with us that was obvious. We had other members in our family that also were gay, and they were in the New York area. And I very seldom got the chance to hang out with my cousin Connie. She was older, had experienced the life for much longer than Reggie but was a great ally for him. And actually when they died, he was their executor of their estate, and this was all prior to any of our parents dying. So I knew that he had a more special connection with them and why. But my mom never saw black, white, gray, she was very open about well, let&#8217;s talk about that, and she saw you for who you were and not necessarily getting to, trying to tell you how to live your life; whereas moms tend to do that sometimes. And that was hard for Aunt Lois.   KB:  Would you consider your family to be religious in nature?  MWB:  Yes. Yes. We&#8217;re either Baptists or Episcopals. And I love both because of what both brings in a setting for me. I love times when nothing is written, and it&#8217;s natural and evolves like in a Baptist ceremony, but in Episcopal I love the smell of the incense. I love the readings and the differences that that plays in terms of the religion. And really, I like both and we have had priests, not ministers, I don&#8217;t think. But we have priests in our family, lots of deacons, and the majority of all of our roots come from our relationship with God. And so my mother even when she got her first job at North Carolina Mutual, she was interviewed in the church because she went to Sunday school. At that time that was the time, that&#8217;s what people did. They found good people in church I guess, so to speak.   KB:  When Reggie first announced his plans to become a priest, what type of responses did he get from his family?  MWB:  We loved it. We loved it particularly as I said our inner beliefs are so aligned with the belief in God and how important of a role that plays whether we are working in the church or a member of the church. It&#8217;s in our roots. It&#8217;s really was a special time. And I got a chance to be there for his ordination. He was in Chicago. I was in graduate school in Iowa, and Iowa is only about six hours, six maybe eight. Anyway, about six hours from where I was in Iowa. And I always found a way to get to Chicago. At that time, he was living there for a couple of years as well. So we even became closer when he was going through the period of time of his ordination.  KB:  Did he have any reservations about becoming a priest? Did he have any inner conflicts that he was battling with before he went through with it?  MWB:  I&#8217;m sure he did. I&#8217;m sure he did. And even talking with you now I realize how much he really was unable to even share with me. I was more of the connector with him [and] his parents. He always knew he could come to Durham, and he could be himself here. But he really needed and wanted to do that with his family, with his immediate family.   KB:  We&#8217;ll take a quick switch turn in questions.  MWB:  Yeah. Let me also say this. The other thing that I have not mentioned is that he has a brother and his brother is the total opposite.  KB:  How is that relationship?  MWB:  At that time there was a big moat in between, and I was the bridge across the moat for both of them. My mother raised his, this is what&#8217;s weird. Before I was born his mother, Reggie&#8217;s mother, had a son from a previous marriage. And that marriage did not work, and she decided during that time period when most of our family members that couldn&#8217;t do well in their towns, they migrated north. She migrated to Washington where she met Reggie&#8217;s father. But in the meantime she had a son that she left in Durham under the care of my mother. My mother had no children at that time. So she actually, with my grandmother, raised Reggie&#8217;s brother who was [a] Vietnam vet, the whole opposite of what Reggie is. Had his own homophobic behaviors, so they weren&#8217;t as close. They grew up eventually to become closer in the end, but it was almost too late. And I was their connecting tissue. I have very different relationship with his brother because he grew up here. He also was in love with my mom and had accepted my mom as really his mom more so than my Aunt Lois. So all of these pieces also had a lot to do with Reggie not sure or not feeling that he had allies within immediate nucleus. But outside of that, one step outside of that into the cousins ring, into his aunts, he had that.   KB: Do you have any thoughts about the fact that his brother was raised by your mom and he was so close to your mom and your mom was so understanding and welcoming of him and his entire self? Do you have any thoughts about why maybe that didn&#8217;t rub off onto his brother since she did raise him?  MWB:  Because his brother was a nut. He ran women. He couldn&#8217;t go to college even though he would&#8217;ve gone to A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University], but he didn&#8217;t go because after a year they had to kick him out. He was a different personality. But what he loved about my mom is that they had developed this relationship over time that became special to him. And that that&#8217;s something that, a mother, I can imagine what my Aunt Lois was going through because she couldn&#8217;t be there with him, she was working at the Pentagon at the time. So for her she had to make the money and send the money home, and so they had this understanding back then maybe families knew that if one couldn&#8217;t take care of the other, someone within the family would do that job. And it doesn&#8217;t negate the fact that you still are missing valuable time with your loved one, it doesn&#8217;t negate the fact that you might not even like it and you would prefer it was you. But my mom and my aunt dealt with that I guess, and we always said if anybody was sick or ever hurt or in need, &#8220;Forget the rest of the crap.&#8221; We have to do what we need to do for each other because we&#8217;re family.  KB:  Do you have any idea what drew Reggie and his brother closer in the later years? What bridged that gap?  MWB:  The part that I would say about the gap that really didn&#8217;t help was for thirty years his brother, my half-brother if you want to call it, lived in Greece. So internationally [he] had married someone from Greece, and his lifestyle was not, he wasn&#8217;t here for us to work on him or for us to figure out what was really going on for him. You have to remember I&#8217;m the baby out of all of these. And for some reason I&#8217;m dealing with adult matters and I&#8217;m the child, the youngest out of everybody. But the thing about it is that I&#8217;m more like my mom in that everybody either gravitated to her or gravitated to me depending on what the issue was. And my cousin Reggie&#8217;s oldest brother realized over time even though he was a part from us that we&#8217;re still family, and in the end he had no idea how ill Reggie was. I mean I didn&#8217;t know. I mean I (       ). And I even remember now having a conversation with him. We were both in a position where we both inherited our family homes. And I remember having this conversation with him now, which I know was one of the last conversations we had around what should I do. And he was thinking then because he had created this nucleus, this other family with an African, I don&#8217;t know, son. He was adopted by two friends of his, and they made him the little boy&#8217;s godson. Well, all of what he owned except items and a sum of money they gave to my daughter as well as to Larry&#8217;s children, all went to this little adopted son, which I and Larry and my daughter got to meet, but no one else from the family has ever met. We&#8217;re weird. So I know I&#8217;m rambling on, but it&#8217;s bringing up all kinds of things that make me realize--  KB:  It&#8217;s perfect. (       )  MWB:  I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really realize it at this time when we were talking that he&#8217;s asking me what should he do, and he really needs to know, and it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s dying. I didn&#8217;t realize that. And at the end of it I kissed him, and he turned away, [he] didn&#8217;t want me to kiss him. I didn&#8217;t ask him at the time, &#8220;What?&#8221; But this was before I really knew what was going on, and then I realized he was trying to protect me. He didn&#8217;t know what he had. He wasn&#8217;t sure what was going on.  KB:  So well, that&#8217;s perfect, perfect segue. How did your family respond to his work with the HIV-AIDS community?  MWB:  I&#8217;m not sure that they knew. I really don&#8217;t know. I think they would&#8217;ve been very proud of him looking back. At the same time, he was dealing with this--his mother and his father were dying. And so I think they really didn&#8217;t know. I think that they understood some of his work, and he was dealing a lot with the religious community and there was a lot of politics as it relates to that. I won&#8217;t even get in the fact of the issues with working for the mayor at that time because Mayor Barry was a trip.  KB:  What were some of the issues?  MWB:  If I&#8217;m allowed to say that.   KB:  If you don&#8217;t want to.  MWB:  Well, he if you read anything about his tenure. He was the man, and everybody loved him in DC. Yet and still he was not going to carry DC into the next millennium with his ways of work. But it was during a volatile time when not dealing with the epidemic but also trying to understand how to get these churches involved and trying to help. And given the fact in general that the black Baptist community was not interested in talking about issues like this and supporting that, I now have a better sense of what he&#8217;s up against or was against. I was also younger so I was jetting to Hawaii or running to here or going to Iowa. So I really wasn&#8217;t putting two and two together. My cousin is potentially with some fatal disease. I had no idea. I really wasn&#8217;t thinking like that, and that&#8217;s the way our family was blinded by the fact that where is Reggie going. He was so vocal and so strong and so vibrant. But we both were dealing with older parents that were aging and, with his older brother not being really around, he was feeling like me, being an only child. And that that was really more than I thought that he was dealing with. I had no idea.   KB: So when Reggie did speak about his trouble or if he did speak about his personal struggle with this illness, how did he talk about it?  Did he ever address what it was specifically?  MWB:  Not until it was late. Reggie went to Colby College, and something happened up in Colby, in Maine. I don&#8217;t know what it was about us, but we all went to some either undergrad or graduate, we all went away as if we wanted to get away from our families to figure out life was for us. He went to Colby. Larry was a hundred miles from Canada so he was at Michigan Tech. At that time I was still in North Carolina getting ready to go somewhere. I don&#8217;t remember where it is. My other cousin was in Boston. So we were all apart from each other, but it was a critical time. His [Reggie&#8217;s] time of understanding and really dealing with who he was came around the time he was an undergrad at Colby. And I know that he knew in high school but, and I can even look at some of the pictures that we took when we were children that, yeah that was him. But I believe that he really grew a lot, understanding his life, living a little bit in New York because he went to New York. He hung out with a lot of actors and dancers and the arts. Then he went to Oxford, and over there I don&#8217;t know any of the people that he was connected with. When he came back he was in Chicago and he had made the decision to become an Episcopal priest was a lot of his understanding, trying to figure out how does all this fit with who I am and who I say I am.   I never knew how special Pauli Murray was to him until his parents and my mom and all of us would talk about, because they knew Pauli or they grew up in, they all grew up in the same neighborhood. So they had been telling me for years to read Proud Shoes. I didn&#8217;t have time for that. I was doing other things. It wasn&#8217;t until I came back here fifteen years ago that I read it, and it was like light bulbs were popping in my head. I mean I knew this woman. I knew of her. I was not of that generation that she was around when I was there. But of course my parents were and my Aunt Lois was, and she often told me you need to read that book. And it never dawned on me. This (       ) was their teacher. So they knew her aunt and they experienced that. But in our community even then when people were different, that was said, but it was, the rest of it, it was an understanding. Yes. They are different. Okay. But when you got outside of our bubble, then people realized their ideas and interests were challenged. And I don&#8217;t know what happened to my Aunt Lois and why she was so adamant about not mine. I know she didn&#8217;t feel Reggie was gay. Just no. She was not going to have that. But it kept Reggie, it kept everybody from being able to talk candidly about it. When we have other members that lived in New York at the time that he was close to that was my aunt&#8217;s age that grew up with my aunt and they knew. They knew that they were gay. It&#8217;s weird.   KB:  Did he ever talk about you or relay conversations that he had with his mom around the issue of being gay?  MWB:  I remember having a talk with him in his room. He was in tears. Reggie would be angry at times and would close himself off at times. He would let me in because sometimes I would stay for a couple of weeks. It was a known fact. Mom would send me up there for six weeks or more, and I'd hang out with him and Larry and the rest of them. But his anger now as I look back on it was because of him trying to wrestle with who he loves and not being able to share really what he was feeling. But he talked to me about coming out to his parents and why he could not. He would never do that because he didn&#8217;t feel that they would ever understand.   KB:  How were the reactions of your family when they learned about his status or about his illness?  MWB:  It goes back to our understanding of we are our brother, our family&#8217;s caretakers. From my generation up we dealt with it. We accepted it and we accepted who he was. And we were there for him as much as he would allow us to be. At that time his partners, I don&#8217;t even know if he had a significant other at that time. But he had two dear friends. One worked for CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] and he traveled a lot, and that&#8217;s how they adopted this African child that were there for him quite a bit. But Reggie&#8217;s nephews and nieces they couldn&#8217;t deal with it. And it was at his funeral that I actually had to say something ugly to a couple of them. &#8220;Either leave or be respectful.&#8221;  KB:  Why did you feel the need to say that?   MWB:  Because some of the things that they were even saying about people in the audience about their sexuality, the whispers. No, you&#8217;re not going to say that here. And if you cannot be respectful, then you need to go. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve ever recovered from that. His nieces and nephews are still close to me and were very honest with me about how they were feeling. It didn&#8217;t change our relationship. They understood how I felt. They respected my point of view as well as others in our family that felt that they were being ugly. They did not come to certain occasions as a result, but now over time--and these are actually his older brother&#8217;s children-- they are very, still very close to me, but I don&#8217;t know that it has changed them. I&#8217;m praying that it has. And as time has gone on that people have grown to understand why people make decisions that they make. And their lives are their lives and who are we to judge. That was hard. I mean I was where our family I felt like that&#8217;s not us. And before my mother died she told everybody, all of our cousins, she pulled all of us together, and there was one other aunt that was still alive at the time. And they said, &#8220;You have just you. We&#8217;re family. Don&#8217;t let that separate you or keep you from being family.&#8221; So we have to continue to press on, and even though I have people that have their own phobic ways and ideas, not to stop the conversation. You&#8217;ve got to talk about it. And that was one of the reasons why Reggie did not feel safe enough but certainly could not talk about it.   KB:  What do you think that your family could have done to make him feel more comfortable or to make him feel more accepted by them?  MWB:  Doing some of the things that I&#8217;m espousing today to his nephews and nieces, the importance of us being open-minded and seeing the heart of the individual, understanding them for who they are. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s most important. I mean he has to wrestle with, this is my opinion about what was going on with Reggie. Reggie has to figure out who it is and what it is that he wants to be. Once he figures that out, then we need to be there to support it, whatever that is. I can do that. My mother did that. My mother did that with me. I&#8217;m sure I made decisions that she did not agree with. And I have to live with the choices that I made as well my daughter. But we can&#8217;t do it walling ourselves off, locking ourselves away as if we don&#8217;t matter. Because he mattered to me. I miss him today. He mattered to me. [Emotional]  KB:  What do you think he&#8217;d want you to do being doing today?  MWB:  He would be proud of me continuing to work for my community. But our family has that type of history. My grandfather was one of the ones that helped create Lyon Park School. We&#8217;re proud of being a part of a family that doesn&#8217;t look at itself but is looking outside of itself, and to me that&#8217;s important. The work that I've been led to, thank God, has allowed me to be able to give back to my community and continue to use other sources and resources to do that. Because I don&#8217;t have it. I&#8217;m poor. I am just like anyone else trying to figure out what makes sense. How do we as a people continue to act like people and not animals and be more supportive and open-minded to those kinds of ideas even though they may not be our own? What makes us different can make us stronger, make us all healthier if we were willing to embrace that. So I hope that even though he&#8217;s not here, I believe he&#8217;s here with me in spirit as is my mother and the things that they taught me to look for in people and not to give up on them. I hope I am giving that same breadth of knowledge to my daughter that she will have learned to not be selfish but to think outside of herself and to find whatever it is that she wants to be, that she will then take that and help not just herself but others in the process. So that is my hope. [Background noise]  KB: Beautiful. How do you think your experience with Reggie has influenced you with others like your daughter who come to you with issues around any type of oppression or any type of stigmas that exist?  MWB:  Well, it&#8217;s interesting because my daughter has decided that she wants to play basketball, not as a career. But she loves the camaraderie, she loves the team aspect, and I encourage that. As an only child I need her to be more engaged in activities that will help grow her into a human being that is socially able to cope with anything. I never know how long I will be here, and she needs to be able to do it on her own and understand that. My daughter recently is experiencing other team members that are coming out or believe that they are gay. So that has allowed us to have lots of conversations about that. She was too young to really know Reggie. But he got to know her. She was three or four years old at the time of his illness. So she was able to get to know a little bit about [him], and she knows him as being the one that has given her a trust fund for her education. So she knows and respects him as an individual and his knowledge. But she&#8217;s also been able to, in reading his book and understanding where he&#8217;s coming from, to be more sensitive and open to other people that she now is meeting and learning about as friends on her team. It has allowed us to be able to talk candidly about that. She can talk to me and other teammates can talk to me when their mothers and fathers are not willing to do so. So that in and of itself teaches me that my experience with Reggie is now moving into a realm, into my daughter&#8217;s generation and helping me understand. I know what it&#8217;s like when you&#8217;re a mom and you ain&#8217;t there. You can&#8217;t help. But it&#8217;s still not going to erase the hurt that in this case I witnessed with my cousin, the anger that I could see him feeling. It&#8217;s an emotional rollercoaster when you&#8217;re not sure of who you are. I feel sad for that because I always knew who I was. At least I thought. And I still think, and I knew that there were issues around for women, race, but that&#8217;s not anything that you can really take away from that except that it&#8217;s going to be always be, when you&#8217;re in Reggie&#8217;s position you can hide some of that. But can you really? If you can&#8217;t talk about it and feel support in the room, then even if people don&#8217;t know. And taking care of one&#8217;s self is what Reggie has taught me. And not think that it&#8217;s going to be handled by somebody. You have to really be willing to open and share and not mind if you hear things you don&#8217;t really want know. My mom did that. I mean I know when I was very candid with her about things, and I got to where I could tell her anything that I realized then that how lucky I was. Because in her older age she would tell me, &#8220;Remember when you told me this. I was cringing. I did not want to hear that.&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t know that. She listened anyway. I hope that I can be that for others. I hope that will be the case with my daughter with her friends.   KB:  So how do you feel that Reggie influenced your involvement with a struggle for LGBTQ [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer] rights in particular or your involvement in that?  MWB:  Well, I&#8217;ve always been open to different lifestyles even if they weren&#8217;t mine. And that that is one of the things that Reggie&#8217;s experience has taught me. It gets back to what I said before, you can&#8217;t close those doors if you really want genuine relationships, and I really want that kind of authentic relationship to emerge with anybody that I&#8217;m with. And that is what I can&#8217;t imagine. If he didn&#8217;t have me to talk to or Larry, I mean he probably would&#8217;ve felt abandoned by his family. And I don&#8217;t want that on my plate. I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s healthy for me as a person.   KB:  So you take on a sense of personal responsibility.  MWB:  Yes. Yes. As I say to Barbara even in doing this journey with the Pauli Murray project and all of that, it has opened my eyes to how people really believe and think and some of which are surprising to me. But others tell me that if we don&#8217;t talk about it, when is it going to be okay to talk about it? We have to demonstrate it, or so that people can see that it&#8217;s okay if I&#8217;m straight, I mean I&#8217;m an ally. Why? Because I believe in this person and that they have the right to believe as they so choose and that they can drink after me. They can eat with me. I've got to be able to feel that, and I don&#8217;t know that closing a population off from that is healthy as a community.   KB:  So you already went into a little bit about your daughter Maya and her basketball team, their struggles. Can you tell me a little bit more about these girls, their backgrounds?  MWB:  Since many of them are playing travel ball, then I would say that their parents are like myself. They have a good career. I&#8217;m sure that many of them go to church (       ). Some of them are Seventh Day Adventists. So that, the religious piece could vary. But for the most part they&#8217;re regular African Americans that go to work every day, that probably go to church if they are affiliated, and sororities because a couple of them are some of my sorority sisters so to speak. So they&#8217;ve gone to college before. They&#8217;re younger. Most of them are younger parents than I am, because I had my daughter when I was forty. They probably see me as the grandmother, but anyway, I look at things a little differently.  KB:  Do you have specific example or a story behind that?  MWB:  Well some parents may not have curfews and boundaries for their children for example. My daughter has to have boundaries. I&#8217;m old fashioned. As long as she&#8217;s under my roof, she has boundaries. They may think that they can afford it. They probably can afford it better than I can. That their children-- &#8220;If I buy them a car, they don&#8217;t have to work, they can just go to school and just play basketball.&#8221; Well, I don&#8217;t believe like that. My daughter has a job. Not because I wanted her to have a job because that was a question whether she would be able to handle the job, her school and her basketball. Because her first goal is academics and is her school. But she has a job, and I&#8217;m trying to teach her responsibilities about why it's important for you to know the difference between what you need and what you want. She already has a good work ethic. She goes to work and even if she has a tournament and she&#8217;s leaving town, then she works those two hours. She&#8217;ll get on the bus and she&#8217;ll travel and she&#8217;ll play games. But that&#8217;s not typical. My daughter is not typical in that sense because many of them have bought their children cars and they give them money for gas. Well, heck, if you can&#8217;t pay for it, then what do you need a car for? It&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s very different in that regard. I hope and I like to think that this is helping my daughter to become a mature responsible individual and that she realizes money does not grow on trees and that if there&#8217;s something that she wants, like she wants to go to Costa Rica in May, and she wants to still continue with basketball, then she has to pay for it. And so that&#8217;s the difference.  KB:  How do you feel that your relationship with your daughter and the way that the dialogue between your daughter differs from that of your parents since there is a generation gap?  MWB:  First of all I&#8217;m not going to live my life through Maya.  So there are people in her basketball situation that they&#8217;re on, they&#8217;re there and they&#8217;re living their lives through their daughters or sons because they want them to play, get exposure, do all this. So I&#8217;m not going to play that route. My first hope is that Maya does well enough academically that she can do what she needs to do, with or without basketball. But that&#8217;s not necessarily the case for some of them. Some people might not have the academics, and basketball is the only way that they make it to school and I understand that. But children have to realize that much of this decision is going to be on them. And when they leave their parents and they go to college, if I haven&#8217;t taught you what you need to know and you&#8217;ve got the fundamentals, when you get there, it&#8217;s not going to be me that they&#8217;re going to be calling and asking you and trying to, it&#8217;s going to be you. So this is the only time that I have with Maya to let her practice and to see how that feels. When I make a decision about what she does in basketball, it is not because I made it. She made it. So if a coach comes to me and says, &#8220;Well I like Maya blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, la, la, la, la.&#8221; Fine, I will talk with her. We will discuss it as a family, as a parent, as a mom. But in the end she has to make the final decisions. She&#8217;s going to have to live with it because it&#8217;s she that&#8217;s going to have to get up five a.m. I will get up with her. I will support you. But in the end it&#8217;s your doing that&#8217;s going to make the difference, not me. So with parents and others at this age for me what I see that&#8217;s different with me being an older parent is that I don&#8217;t sweat a lot of the small stuff that some parents seem to do. It&#8217;s wild to me because I hear some of the things when I&#8217;m sitting there, we&#8217;re all sitting there together waiting for them to continue to practice or play basketball or whatever. And I hear some of them and they&#8217;re like well, one of them was like, &#8220;Well, are you thinking about putting Maya into this, there&#8217;s a pre-camp and this, da da da.&#8221; I says, &#8220;That&#8217;s up to her. If she can afford it, then she can go.&#8221; You should see the faces on the parents. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;What?&#8221; But anyway, it&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s different in that way, in that regard. When she comes to me and she can tell me what her friends are saying and how her friends are feeling and that they can talk candidly about that in front of me, that&#8217;s what I hope. I hope that I&#8217;m raising a child that feels comfortable bringing her friends to my house, and at least I know where they are, and they can talk freely, and they can work it out because this is a time when they need to practice, and they need to figure out what life is really about. Now my daughter has a boyfriend, and as far as I know she has not indicated to me that she&#8217;s gay, but it wouldn&#8217;t matter to me if that&#8217;s what she wanted. But it has to be what she wants. I have provided her with a foundation with Bible classes and our traditional kinds of belief systems. Now I have to let it work. It&#8217;s up to her however she ends up becoming. It&#8217;s her that has to answer to God, just like I have to answer for my actions. So I want to be there to support her. And I&#8217;m hoping that if need be, and there are others that are out there, understanding more now through the work of Pauli Murray and listening and hearing from people that are wrestling with these issues recapping or revisiting what my cousin must&#8217;ve been going through and me being ignorant to all that, tells me that there&#8217;s much work to be done. I need to be about doing that in a way that&#8217;s inclusive.  KB:  You hinted earlier about her friends talking to you as she could openly talk to you, have her friends specifically spoken to you about what they&#8217;re going through as far as their sexuality or their relationships with their parents?  MWB:  No, not yet.   KB:  Does she talk about&#8212;  MWB:  I&#8217;m glad that they haven&#8217;t because then that would put me in an awkward position, but it would put me in a position that I would have to ask the daughter or son how do you want me to use this information. What do you want me to do with this information? How can I be of help particularly if someone is at a point where I&#8217;m really concerned about their mental health, and I would never want anyone to be alone through whatever they&#8217;re trying to deal with. I feel like my cousin was alone in some respect.   KB:  So Maya, does she talk about her teammates and the struggle they&#8217;re going through?  MWB:  Yeah.  KB:  How is her reaction to it? What&#8217;s she feeling? What are her thoughts?  MWB:  Well, it depends on who it is. She&#8217;s had an experience with one of the seniors on the team who had really related to Maya. We knew she was gay. She had said this. Her mother was having a difficult time dealing with it and had kicked her out of the house. She found another family member that was willing to take her in. Even though by the end of the year the mother accepted her daughter back into the home, but I&#8217;m not sure if she ever accepted who she was. After graduation and it was determined that she would be going to a college in South Carolina to play ball, I noticed that she was carrying around this stuffed animal everywhere. It was like a little stuffed animal that she would have in her armpit and I said something to Maya, I says, &#8220;I noticed this. What&#8217;s up? I mean, why does she carrying this little stuff animal? This is a twelfth grader that&#8217;s just graduated that&#8217;s going to college.&#8221; And so Maya would say to me, she said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a gift from her friend and it&#8217;s some understanding that they have between each other. And everybody is noticing it but nobody is saying anything to her about it.&#8221; And she still had it. And her mother never mentioned it, but this young lady was walking around for months with this stuffed animal. I don&#8217;t think her mom and her had really dealt with everything, but she was going to school then. And so it was almost like her mother had just accepted the fact well, she&#8217;s going to be who she&#8217;s going to be. But they never talked about it. Maya talked with me about it but because there was no real answer for it and no one really addressed it peer wise. They would ask her but she said oh this is a gift from so and so. But it was so strange. That type of behavior to me says that she probably needs some counseling, in my opinion.   KB:  Did she ever tell Maya anything deeper than that?  MWB:  Probably but Maya may not have told me.   KB:  Does Maya ever talk about her (       ) how they&#8217;re being treated or her confusion for why, like for that particular instance why nobody talks about it?  MWB:  Well, she thought that that was silly. But even though she felt that it was silly she felt like it was a tell, like in poker or something that it was telling you that hey, I&#8217;m okay but I&#8217;m not, which I thought was very astute on her part. But over time because of all of these different kinds of instances and issues that were coming up for this young lady, and she&#8217;s trying to go to college. She was the point guard for the team. So they were close enough to stay together to finish the season out but pretty much after that she hasn&#8217;t been as close or around her as much.  KB:  Is Maya close with the entire team this way or was that a special relationship?  MWB:  She&#8217;s, Maya, Maya is developing this leadership role on the team. And so I, she has, actually Maya&#8217;s other dear friend, that is a dear friend that she played with in middle school, she wants to come out but she won&#8217;t. But she and Maya are very close. And sometimes it&#8217;s awkward. I know what the situation is, but I&#8217;m not sure I can talk to her parents or her mom yet about it because her mom will say things, &#8220;Oh I wish my daughter would dress like Maya. I think she looks so girly.&#8221; And I want to say, &#8220;She looks great as she is.&#8221; That&#8217;s the best I can do with her mom at this point not knowing her well enough to say, &#8220;She&#8217;s fine.&#8221; Anyway, so we&#8217;ll see. That&#8217;s another chapter, and Maya and this young lady have two more years together on the team. So we&#8217;ll see.   KB:  In your opinion what makes being a queer teenager or being questionably queer I guess if you want to say quote unquote different from being a straight teenager or someone who falls into the norm?  MWB:  I have to say I don&#8217;t know that I could say. All teenagers have things that are going to be common for them that they&#8217;re wrestling with. I also think that there are uniqueness, similarities as it relates to things that are different. So I can&#8217;t take away the fact that I&#8217;m a woman and that I&#8217;m black. And possibly if you&#8217;re queer you would say, I can&#8217;t take away if I&#8217;m flaming or if I&#8217;m what, I don&#8217;t know what--. I mean some people that would not necessarily use that term may be queer, but I can&#8217;t tell that they are or not. I mean they don&#8217;t necessarily display something that would be stereotypical that might make me think that. So I guess in looking at all of this whether it&#8217;s, whatever that difference might be that there&#8217;s something common about that, those differences, the ones that you can&#8217;t erase, the ones that you can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. That is what you are. That is what I am. The best thing that I would say that would be important for all of them is to figure out who they are and to be accepting of who they are as a person, and that&#8217;s the best we can do. I&#8217;m not sure that my cousin, he may have come to that realization in the end especially when he was dealing with his ordination, be proud of who he is. Be proud of that and don&#8217;t let anyone discount that. God created you. You&#8217;re a creature of that, and I feel like if we can be genuine and relate to being who we are in the long run it&#8217;s what we all have to try to do.   KB:  When you spoke earlier about Maya&#8217;s best friend who is struggling with this in the closet, I guess you can say, and her parents or mom you don&#8217;t really know how you would even address it or now is the right time to address it. As far as that next step comes, how do you think you would train adults or help adults to understand these kids and their different experience with being queer?  MWB:  First of all if you&#8217;re dealing with adults there has to be a willingness to want to understand this life. This life. If not, it won&#8217;t make a difference. You&#8217;re not going to change anything. We&#8217;re too old to change. But now if they&#8217;re willing and if because they have a family member that they know their heart, then they might be more open to trying to understand, and that&#8217;s where (       ) comes from. That&#8217;s where it&#8217;s important to try to force one out of their comfort zone and possibly begin to think differently about something. I mean now that you have family that now may relate to this style of life, now what are you going to do? You can&#8217;t solve it unless individuals are ready and willing and open to talk about it. There&#8217;s lots of things I didn&#8217;t understand about my cousin&#8217;s life and his lifestyle, but what I loved was him. Now can we get passed that now that we know that it&#8217;s really about the individual and the care that you have for them. Then can we talk candidly, can we relate now because we have an opportunity, a willingness on both parties to talk. Dialogue is important in these kinds of efforts to begin to understand because sometimes you think you know and you really don&#8217;t. You really don&#8217;t know. And I feel like that right now even in my family, you don&#8217;t.  KB:  What kind of support do you think these kids or people that identify this way would want or need?  MWB:  They want to be seen. They don&#8217;t want to be invisible to folks in some cases if you don&#8217;t like who I am, don&#8217;t trash me, don&#8217;t destroy me. Let me be. Let me be maybe in an environment that will accept me, and we have to be willing to work with that.   KB:  So other than you seeking to or being willing to help these kids get through this struggle or help get along on the way. Do any other adults in that social sphere that would also be willing, maybe coaches, teachers who have expressed a need to maybe express this?  MWB:  Yeah, I lately my work has been moving me into the homeless arena, and I've found that lots of people, youth, as they determine who they are may not be able to stay in the home because their parents or whomever are not supportive of their lifestyle. So I&#8217;m still learning and understanding what all this really means and how it&#8217;s manifesting itself within our community. There are people out there that like to work with people, but the question is where are they and what can we do to help provide safe havens or places--this is what adults can do--for youth that need more support. If we don&#8217;t have identified areas for that, then they&#8217;re going to fall through the cracks and in the end we have not really done anything. I would say there are people out there, but they&#8217;re not mobilized. They&#8217;re not quite sure what to do. You&#8217;ve got parents now that are wrestling with it because their children are wrestling with it. And they may not know how or what to do as well. My experience with my own family taught me that. Now even though they&#8217;re allies within the family, sometimes you&#8217;re not as accessible, and allies are not totally up to speed. They don&#8217;t have all the information and so they don&#8217;t know how they could&#8217;ve been of help. But if we don&#8217;t talk about it and if we sweep it under the rug and if we just continue to put it in a closet, then will we ever know. And we as adults should be able to begin to talk about it so that it makes it a little bit easier for you to feel that safeness.   KB:  Well, those are all the questions I have right now.   MWB:  You sure?  KB:  Um hmm. But is there anything that you thought I'd ask that I didn&#8217;t or anything you&#8217;d like to add.  MWB:  Only that I&#8217;m very impressed. You were very well prepared. I like that.  KB:  Thank you.  MWB:  You made me cry. I wasn&#8217;t, I had already said I&#8217;m going to be strong. I&#8217;m not going to cry. I have to say that this, the questions was enlightening for me and very thoughtful. Thank you. No, but what this experience will do for me and I&#8217;m going on vacation is to make me reflect some more. And I&#8217;ll probably re-read his work. Did you get a chance to read his work?  KB:  I did.  MWB:  What did you think?  KB:  I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it from a standpoint I feel right now I&#8217;m at a crossroads in my own faith. I've always been very spiritual but not very into organized religion because I didn&#8217;t like the restrictions or the judgments that were placed on me in my lifestyle and my beliefs through structured religion. I was raised Christian, and so now I&#8217;m accepting it I&#8217;m walking my own path with God trying to become stronger with my faith and with my relationship with God. When I read pieces like this from people who are coming from the perspective of walking with God I feel like I&#8217;m more in tune with it. I&#8217;m adequate. I&#8217;m able to really read it for what it is and understand it in a better way.   MWB:  Yeah.  KB:  So it&#8217;s enlightening. It&#8217;s exciting.  MWB:  That&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s nice. That&#8217;s what Reggie would&#8217;ve wanted. That&#8217;s very good.  KB:  Also do you think Maya would be willing to talk with us or getting any of her friends so maybe they could talk with us. All of their information would be confidential.  MWB:  Sure.  KB:  If they were interested.  MWB:  Sure I&#8217;ll talk to Maya.  KB:  That would be great.  MWB:  I&#8217;ll let you figure out if she&#8217;s willing the friends part. But I&#8217;ll talk to Maya and you can talk to her.   KB: Or you can talk without a recording, just talk.  MWB:  Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;ll be glad to.   KB:  And do you have a problem with this interview being placed in the archive or do you want any restrictions placed on its access?  MWB:  I don&#8217;t think so. It is what it is.   KB:  Sounds good. Anything else?  MWB:  No, you&#8217;re good.
