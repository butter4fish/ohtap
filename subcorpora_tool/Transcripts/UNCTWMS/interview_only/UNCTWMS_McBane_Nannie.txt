Karen Griffin: This is Karen Griffin on Friday, June 6, 2013, Karen Griffin, 2013, June 7. I&#8217;m at the home of Nannie McBane in Eli Whitney, North Carolina.  We are on now. First of all, thank you for agreeing to let me come and interview you. I appreciate it and I know that you know that we&#8217;re going to do another interview later in the summer. But today I want to learn about you and your life, so why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about growing up, what that was like for you.
Nannie McBane: Well, I grew up in the country, like most of us did. My father was a tenant farmer so we moved every three or four years until we moved to Saxapahaw. By that time Dad had accumulated enough money to buy some property and he almost bought some that was in Durham County but he didn&#8217;t because he was a tobacco farmer and that land had the Granville wilt in it, so the land was no count as far as my dad was concerned. So he bought a farm up at Saxapahaw on Rumley Road. That property on Rumley Road will not perc now. Of course nobody&#8217;s farming it. But the land that was no count in Durham County is in Research Triangle Park.
KG: How about that? [Laughs] It wasn&#8217;t good for tobacco but it was good for other things.
NB: Yes, it was.
KG: So how old were you when you moved to Saxapahaw?
NB: I was in third grade so I was nine.
KG: Well you had spent some time traveling then.
NB: Yes, a little.
KG: Now when you came to Saxapahaw your dad was a tobacco farmer.
NB: Right.
KG: And you started school.  NB: Right.  KG: In Saxapahaw or in Eli Whitney?  NB: Saxapahaw.   KG: So there was a separate elementary school.  NB: Right.  KG: Okay. Well tell me about that. Did you ever come to Eli Whitney to school?  NB: Yes, in high school.  KG: Was that the only high school around?  NB: Yes, it was.  KG: Okay. And what year did you start high school?  NB: 1949.  KG: 1949. So the Quilting Bee had been going on for eighteen years then.  NB: Right.  KG: And were you familiar with the Quilting Bee then?  NB: By that time I had heard about it, but I&#8217;d never been to the Quilting Bee.  KG: Did your mother quilt?  NB: Very little.  KG: Were there other children in your family?  NB: I have two sisters.  KG: Are they older, younger?  NB: One younger, one older, but they did not care about quilts.  KG: Did you care about quilting?  NB: Yes. I&#8217;ve always liked quilts.  KG: Okay. So, when did you meet Henry?  NB: About 1949.  KG: Now one of your daughters thought maybe y&#8217;all had gotten married while you were still in high school.  NB: That&#8217;s right. We did.  KG: You did? So you hadn&#8217;t finished school and got married.  NB: Right.  KG: But you went on to finish school.  NB: Mm hmm.  KG: Was Henry the same age as you?  NB: No, he was three years older.  KG: So he had finished school.  NB: Yes. He was in the military at this time.  KG: In the Army?  NB: Yes.  KG: Did he have a home?  NB: Well, no, he didn&#8217;t. But after we got married, after I finished high school, I did go down to the military base to live with him.  KG: And lived with him.  NB: Mm hmm.  KG: So after y&#8217;all married you stayed at home and he went to the base.  NB: Right.  KG: Now were your parents happy? Were they agreeable to the marriage?  NB: Yes, they were.  KG: Well that&#8217;s a good thing. So you went to the military base, Fayetteville.  NB: No, Fort Jackson.  KG: Fort Jackson.  NB: Columbia, South Carolina.  KG: That&#8217;s a hot place. Were you there in the summertime?  NB: Yes.  KG: That&#8217;s very hot in the summertime.  NB: Yes. It was very hot that first summer.  KG: I imagine. Did you work while you were down there?  NB: A little. I worked with the Social Security Administration of South Carolina.  KG: And this is 1959, 1960?  NB: No, this was 1953.  KG: 1953, okay. Now, the world was very different then. Tell me what it was like as a newlywed living in Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  NB: Well, I was looking for a job and got used to people telling me they couldn&#8217;t give me a job because I was not permanent. See, you always get excuses when you&#8217;re being told no, regardless.  KG: You think it was because you were a woman?  NB: No. I think there just were not that many jobs available.  KG: But you did eventually get a job.  NB: Yes.  KG: And that was doing what?  NB: Let&#8217;s see. The employers everywhere, sends in a report of how much social security you&#8217;ve paid in.  KG: Right.  NB: So we&#8217;d go to those lists and retype the information on forms, so each person had their own files.   KG: Very good. So how long did you stay with the Social Security Administration?  NB: About nine months.  KG: And then did Henry get transferred?  NB: No. It was time for him to be relieved, so.  KG: So he didn&#8217;t stay in after that.  NB: No.  KG: So what did he do? Did y&#8217;all come back to Eli Whitney or Saxapahaw?  NB: Yes, we did, came back to Eli Whitney, and he farmed a little.   KG: Did y&#8217;all live here? Is this where you moved to, the house we&#8217;re in now?  NB: Not this house; his mother and dad&#8217;s house. We lived with them.  KG: Okay. Until Henry built this house? Is this the house y&#8217;all built together?  NB: Yes, this is the house we built together, but in the meanwhile we did live with my mom.  KG: Okay.  NB: And then after we started having the children we moved out here to this house.   KG: Okay. So, you worked before you had children.  NB: Uh huh.  KG: And when you had your first daughter, Kathy, in 1957, I believe&#8211;.  NB: Yes, that&#8217;s Wendy.   KG: That&#8217;s Wendy. I&#8217;m sorry, Wendy. You stopped working.  NB: Yes.  KG: Was that something that you and Henry planned, for you to stay home and raise the kids?
NB: Well, no, it&#8217;s just the way it happened. Then people did not have the time off from work like they have now, so where I was working, (       ), you had to leave your job. That was it.
KG: When you had a baby?
NB: Uh huh.
KG: So they wouldn&#8217;t hire you back.
NB: Well, they might hire you back, but you wasn&#8217;t guaranteed a job. [Pause] I lost my train of thought.
KG: That&#8217;s fine. You were talking about you didn&#8217;t go back to work after you had Kathy, that you didn&#8217;t have a job. So Henry farmed. What did he farm?
NB: He grew tobacco.
KG: Okay.
NB: And he [had cows and sold milk.]
KG: Okay. And did you have a garden for the family?
NB: Oh yes.
KG: And did you have cows and pigs that you ate as well?
NB: Yes.
KG: So everything was right here.
NB: Right.
KG: So did you put those girls to work in the garden when they got up of any age?
NB: I tried.
KG: [Laughs] It didn&#8217;t work? How about milking the cows?
NB: No, they never did have to milk. I didn&#8217;t either.
KG: You were smart. My mama was the same way. She said she knew if she started milking cows that the boys would make her do it.
NB: That&#8217;s right.
KG: And she didn&#8217;t want to do it. So what was a day like for you when Wendy was a little girl?
NB: Really by the time Wendy was born I was living with my mom, and I can&#8217;t say it was any different from any other day.
KG: Did your day start off early?
NB: Mine didn&#8217;t.
KG: So, what, 7:00, 8:00?
NB: 7:00.
KG: 7:00. Did you have to cook breakfast?
NB: No. At that time Henry was driving a truck out of Durham so he only came home on the weekends.
KG: Okay. So where did he drive to?
NB: Different places. He worked for Epes and he hauled tobacco [     ] all around the country.
KG: So you didn&#8217;t have to get up every morning and cook his breakfast.
NB: No, I didn&#8217;t.
KG: Or his lunch or his dinner.
NB: That&#8217;s right.
KG: Oh! You got off easy then. Now were you helping your mom? Was her health not good?
NB: She was working at that time, so really I&#8217;ve never had to cook.
KG: Well weren&#8217;t you the lucky one?
NB: My mother-in-law was a very good cook too. I never did have to learn to cook as good as she could, but only as good as Henry could.
KG: [Laughs] It sounds like you were ahead of your time then, if Henry cooked.
NB: [Laughs] Well he likes to eat, so he cooked it.
KG: He cooked it. There you go. Well now did you work in the garden or work with the farm in tobacco?
NB: Anything that needed to be done.
KG: How about sewing? Did you make your clothes?
NB: Well yes.
KG: Is that when you started to quilt?
NB: Yes, because I think about quilting as a byproduct of sewing.
KG: Right. So tell me a little bit about how you got started quilting.
NB: Well I realized I wanted to make a quilt so I sewed some blocks together, and my mother-in-law, she used to help me quilt it, but I ended up quilting on a sewing machine. It wasn&#8217;t necessary for us to use the big old frames. But later on she did show me how you used the big old frames.
KG: Is that real different, quilting on one of the big frames?
NB: It is a little different, but that was always traditional. You always see pictures of people around a big old frame.
KG: Were your stitches pretty and even?
NB: Well, no.
KG: [Laughs]
NB: But you grow into that.
KG: You grow into it. So did you make quilts for everyday use, or did you make quilts to show, or did you make both?
NB: Well I make quilts for everyday use but make them look as good as I can.
KG: Did your girls get quilts when they got married, from you?
NB: Only Kathy has received a quilt. [Laughs]
KG: [Laughs] But I see you have other quilts hanging around here. Did you make the one that&#8217;s behind you?
NB: No. That was given to me. I quilted that one, though.
KG: It is beautiful. I will have to get a picture of that before I leave today because it is beautiful. So tell me, you grew up essentially during the Depression.
NB: Right afterwards.
KG: Right after, and the South was still pretty depressed.
NB: Right.
KG: Tell me how that was different from today.
NB: [Pause] Hmm.
KG: What&#8217;s the biggest difference?
NB: Between growing up when I did and today?
KG: And today, yes, ma&#8217;am.
NB: I don&#8217;t know. I think I still have the influence of the Depression on me enough that I don&#8217;t know the difference.
KG: Tell me how it&#8217;s influenced you then.
NB: Okay. Use everything, make what you can. What&#8217;s that expression? Use it up, do without.
KG: Do you wash your aluminum foil?
NB: I don&#8217;t. [Laughs]
KG: I have known women that do.
NB: I do, uh huh.
KG: And reuse it.
NB: Right.
KG: Now is this how you raised your girls?
NB: I think I did.
KG: Okay. Well, I know Libby and I think you did. At least with her I feel like you did, because she&#8217;s not a wasteful person. Have you seen a change in the quality of things that you buy now from the Depression since you were growing up, for instance in furniture or things that should be lasting a long time?
NB: I still try to. I get the best I can for the money.
KG: Okay. So did you and Henry build the house, or did you have someone build it for you?
NB: Someone built this for us.
KG: Okay. Well he must have saved up a good amount of money, to be able to build a house, and he must have worked very hard.
NB: Well, I don&#8217;t know.
KG: [Laughs] Tell me, your girls grew up in the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s out here. There was a lot of stuff going on in the country. Did you see a lot of that out here, when the schools became desegregated?
NB: I don&#8217;t think so. Not me personally.
KG: Did you remember them coming home and talking about the first time they went to school with an African American child, or did they?
NB: They did. I do not remember them talking about it though.
KG: Okay. Well how about the women&#8217;s liberation movement? Did they talk about that, or were you involved in that in any way?
NB: I wasn&#8217;t personally involved but I think me and my girls, we&#8217;ve always been liberated. We&#8217;ve always done what we wanted to.
KG: What you wanted to. Well where did you get that from, Nannie, because that&#8217;s very unusual?
NB: I don&#8217;t know.
KG: Was your mother like that?
NB: My mother was a very strong person, and my daddy was too, but. [Pause]
KG: Did you have the feeling growing up that you could do anything you wanted to do?
NB: I&#8217;ll say yes, that is if you want to do the right things. [Laughs]
KG: Right, right. But you felt like there was not a job you couldn&#8217;t do if you wanted, or&#8211;.
NB: Right.
KG: And you married Henry, so you got married and you had a family, and you were a young woman, but you went back to work after the girls were born.
NB: Mm hmm.
KG: Had the work force changed a lot when you went back to work?
NB: Oh, yes.
KG: Can you tell me one of the major ways that it had changed? What did you notice?
NB: I noticed more people, I&#8217;ll say coworkers, fussing among themselves, very unhappy-like.
KG: Do you think it was personal or do you think there was friction because of what y&#8217;all were doing, or your bosses? Where was that friction coming from? Do you have any idea?
NB: I don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t concentrate on it at the time.
KG: Now you worked at UNC Student Health Services.
NB: Right.
KG: After the girls went to college.
NB: Mm hmm.
KG: What was it like working over at UNC in 1985?
NB: It was different, because see I&#8217;ve always  lived on my own, out to myself, and certain things you don&#8217;t talk about in public. The things I was hearing people talk about over there we whispered at home.
KG: Can you tell me what kind of things y&#8217;all had to whisper at home? What were they talking about?
NB: Like, of course at Student Health a lot of girls came in needing pregnancy tests and so forth.
KG: Right.
NB: And that&#8217;s something that it was whispered when I was growing up. But seems like nowadays they don&#8217;t whisper nothing.
KG: [Laughs] Well, that&#8217;s probably very true. Well, how did you feel about that, and was there birth control available for them?
NB: Yes, there was birth control available.
KG: How did you feel about that?
NB: I guess I&#8217;m for it. I thought it was a shame that it wasn&#8217;t available for the high school girls.
KG: You thought it was a shame it wasn&#8217;t there and available for high school girls?
NB: Mm hmm.
KG: Well that&#8217;s a very liberal way of looking at things. Did you talk to your girls about sex and birth control?
NB: No, I didn&#8217;t.
KG: Did they learn about it at school?
NB: I guess they did. I hope they did. [Laughs]
KG: [Laughs] You hope they did. Well now one of your daughters put a little bird in my ear about something you brought home from over there that you used to lay beside the telephone that was a topic of conversation. Do you remember that?
NB: No. What was it?
KG: I don&#8217;t want to embarrass you, but Libby said you brought home some condoms one time and put them by the phone. I&#8217;m sure that was something that you were not used to discussing out loud either.
NB: Right.
KG: Well how did Henry feel about this? How did he feel about you working over there, and here you have unwed girls coming in, maybe pregnant?
NB: Well he didn&#8217;t know about it I guess, because I never did talk about my work at home.
KG: Okay.
NB: And he didn&#8217;t talk about his work to me either.
KG: Okay. But your girls knew what was going on&#8211;
NB: Oh yes, they did.
KG: &#8211;I&#8217;m sure. So were they proud of you for working in an environment like that? Were they proud of you for going back to work?
NB: I really do not know.
KG: Well, they&#8217;d gone off to college. Is this something you wanted to do or something you had to do?
NB: I felt I needed to go to work. By this time, see, my children was already grown; all the parents had died; so I had no excuse not to work.
KG: And Henry was okay with you going back to work in the public.
NB: I&#8217;m not sure he was.
KG: You didn&#8217;t ask. You just&#8211;  NB: I didn&#8217;t ask&#8211;  KG: &#8211;went.
NB: &#8211;him, I just went.
KG: And I get the feeling that&#8217;s a lot like how your married life was. You just did and he was&#8211;. Did he ever say, &#8220;Nannie, maybe you shouldn&#8217;t do that?&#8221;
NB: I can&#8217;t remember him ever telling me that.
KG: So he was a pretty liberated man, then.
NB: I guess. I didn&#8217;t think about it like that. [Laughs]
KG: But you didn&#8217;t really have to worry, because I know during that time some women didn&#8217;t go to work because their husbands didn&#8217;t want them to go to work.
NB: That&#8217;s right.
KG: But you always felt like you could do what you wanted to do?
NB: Yes.
KG: And you were glad to see birth control come about. How did you feel about segregation?
NB: Well, like I say, I was never really prejudiced as some people I knew, but I was taught that the Afro-Americans, they had their life and I had mine but they weren&#8217;t the same.
KG: I guess you probably worked with some African American women though when you were at UNC, or did you not?
NB: Yes, there were some there, and some of my best friends are black.
KG: So did you find your lives were very different, or similar, and how?
NB: I remember one lady I ate lunch with every day. We were the same age, we both had the same number of children, and our lives was very similar growing up. She was black and I was white, and we did not do the same job, we just happened to eat lunch the same time every day.
KG: Have you stayed in touch with her?
NB: Yes, I have.
KG: Well that&#8217;s very good. That&#8217;s very good. Let&#8217;s go back to the quilting for a few minutes. That started what year, 1931?
NB: That&#8217;s right.
KG: And that&#8217;s right during the Great Depression.
NB: Right.
KG: Can you tell me a little bit about why they started Uncle Eli&#8217;s Quilting&#8211;Bee, I think it was known then&#8211;why it was started?
NB: Okay. There was the integration of the schools and everybody wasn&#8217;t agreeable to this integration so it was one way of bringing parents together and trying to get some cooperation between the parents.
KG: So who actually started it?
NB: Mr. E. P. Dixon, the former principal.
KG: Now did you ever go to the quilting party while you were in school, or was it after?
NB: It was after I was in school.
KG: What made you start going?
NB: I guess my mother-in-law wanted to go.
KG: Okay.
NB: And so.
KG: Do you remember what year it was, that first year you went?
NB: [Pause] Probably about 1963.
KG: Okay. What was it like, that very first one you went to? Was there a lot of people?
NB: Yes, there was several people, not as many as we have today though, and a lot of these old women, I used to see them come in there and quilt and I didn&#8217;t know who they were but I did get to know them later.
KG: And did you start quilting then?
NB: Yes, I started quilting on my own back then. When I did my first quilting we quilted here at this house. My mother-in-law, my aunt, and my mom and I, the four of us would get together and quilt, and that&#8217;s where I learned to use the big frame and all that, and because we were quilting we took a quilt over to the quilting party and quilted it. We also came up with a method of quilting, little small shells, where we could finish a quilt in one day.
KG: That&#8217;s impressive. And this was the four women in your family?
NB: Mm hmm.
KG: What did your girls think of this? They were little.
NB: They were small, but I guess anything Mama does they like it too.
KG: So did you start going every year then?
NB: Yes, I did.
KG: So when did you take on the responsibility of running this show and getting it together?
NB: Let&#8217;s see. When did the school close?
KG: Was it back in the &#8217;80s? I can check on that. The Eli Whitney School closed?
NB: Uh huh.
KG: I&#8217;m not sure, but I can check on that.
NB: No, earlier. Let me think. I know the PTA usually sponsored the Quilting Party over there, and the year there was no school, I&#8217;m trying to think how we managed that quilting.
KG: Did you have it still in the gym, or maybe the fire department?
NB: We&#8217;ve always had it at the school except one year we had it down&#8211;. That was the year the school was closed, I think.
KG: And you had it at&#8211;.
NB: The fire department.
KG: At the fire department?
NB: And the next year they must have opened the school again. But anyway, when the PTA was no longer available to sponsor it we had to do it ourselves.
KG: So they no longer sponsored it, so who started doing it, you?
NB: Me, Bonnie Braxton, Miss Mildred Gregory. She was in home demonstration clubs.
KG: Mildred. What&#8217;s her last name?
NB: Gregory. We just saw to it the plates and cups were there at lunchtime.
KG: So everybody knew this was the first Thursday in April.
NB: That&#8217;s right.
KG: And was this for the community, or did people from other towns and villages come?
NB: It was for everybody but it was mostly the community.
KG: But no church sponsored it or anything like that?
NB: No.
KG: Did you have African American women show quilts, or was it primarily the white women?
NB: At first it was primarily white.
KG: Okay. Has that changed?
NB: Yes, it has changed.
KG: When did you first notice that?
NB: I can&#8217;t tell you a year, but we enjoy the black people bringing their quilts.
KG: Are these women from this area as well?
NB: Yes. They were women from this area.
KG: Okay. So when we say &#8220;this area,&#8221; does this include Chapel Hill or Greensboro or is it primarily southern Alamance County?
NB: Right now? Right now it&#8217;s so much bigger. It includes quilting guilds from Vance-Granville College.
KG: Right.
NB: And quilting guilds from Asheboro. [Pause]
KG: Well, that&#8217;s a good&#8211;.
NB: And from Danville. So the community has really grown quite a bit.
KG: It has. And do you send out any kind of notice every year that this is going to happen?
NB: We will make sure the newspaper gets a notice of it.
KG: Okay. I know the Burlington Times News usually runs an article and I&#8217;m sure the Alamance News does as well. Now, I understand one year you made a quilt that was presented to the governor. It was a quilt of Alamance County, is that correct?
NB: Uh huh, Kerr Scott.
KG: To Kerr Scott. Who made this quilt, or did y&#8217;all all make it?
NB: That was before my time, by the way. I was in high school&#8211;
KG: Well you were just a child.
NB: &#8211;when Kerr Scott came over and they presented him that quilt. I remember him driving up in a chauffeured limousine.
KG: Oh, my. That was&#8211;.
NB: At the school.
KG: That was fancy.
NB: But I remember Mr. Hutchinson, he drew all the townships on a piece of fabric for the ladies. So Addie Belle Richardson, I know she was one of them that worked on it.
KG: Have you seen this quilt?
NB: Yes.
KG: Is it beautiful, I bet?
NB: Yes, it is pretty.
KG: I&#8217;m going to try and see if I can&#8217;t find it and take a picture of it. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s probably somewhere in the Scott family. I&#8217;m sure they probably have it. [Pause] It would be nice if maybe one year they could bring that back to Uncle Eli&#8217;s to show for the community.
NB: Mm hmm.
KG: That would be nice. Tell me how the women have changed since you first started going to these quilting parties. How have the women changed?
NB: Well, in a way quilting has changed too, because now most of us wants to make something that&#8217;s very pretty for our beds. They really don&#8217;t appreciate other people working on it. So you can become the type of quilter you don&#8217;t want nobody else to put stitches on your quilt.
KG: Now is that a good thing?
NB: Well I think it is. I&#8217;m also happy to see people bring their own projects to work on.
KG: Well I&#8217;m sure the need has changed, because back when you were young you had to have quilts for warmth.
NB: Right.
KG: Now you see quilts hung on the wall as artwork. But there&#8217;s probably still a need for both, do you think?
NB: Yes, I think we need both.
KG: Have the women&#8217;s attitudes towards quilting changed, do you think?
NB: I don&#8217;t think so. You could sit down anywhere in public and start working on a quilt and you&#8217;ll have people coming, speaking to you, talking to you about quilts. Everybody has a memory of somebody working on a quilt.
KG: Right. How about, do you think women are more serious today than they were, or do you think this is more just a hobby for fun, or how do the women approach this now? Do they approach it as art that they&#8217;re wanting to preserve, or folk craft?
NB: Well there&#8217;s so many variables so that you have so many different women, different reasons. But I think most of the women I see now, they go purchase their fabrics and they want it to look a certain way. They don&#8217;t mind spending the money to make sure it looks that way too.
KG: So how do you make your quilts? Do you go purchase the fabric?
NB: Usually I do not because I have a lot of fabric here. I try my best to use what I&#8217;ve got. That&#8217;s the Depression-era thinking, you know.
KG: There you go. Did you use like the girls&#8217; clothes or Henry&#8217;s shirts?
NB: I have done all of that.
KG: What&#8217;s the most favorite quilt you&#8217;ve made?
NB: I don&#8217;t know. What I&#8217;m working on at the present, I guess.
KG: [Laughs] And what are you working on right now?
NB: Let me think. I do plan to finish up a quilt I started in 1977.
KG: And what is it?
NB: It&#8217;s an appliqu&#233; tulip.
KG: Oh my. Now why has it taken you&#8211;?
NB: I do not like working with appliqu&#233;.
KG: Okay. So why did you start it?
NB: I remember one day we had several days&#8217; cold weather and I had a little old heater here, trying to keep warm. I found a little piece of red fabric and I started drawing off tulips, thinking about springtime.
KG: So did you do your own designs in everything, or did you ever do&#8211;? I&#8217;m not sure what all the different patterns are called, like the wedding ring or&#8211;. Did you do that kind of thing, or did you do your own design?
NB: I have done wedding rings. I appreciate seeing people do their own. You can use the wedding ring pattern but you could vary the shape of that piece a little bit or something, to make it yours.
KG: So you like things that don&#8217;t look like everything else.
NB: That&#8217;s right.
KG: Very good. What did you think about the controversy over that little girl with the&#8211;Sunbonnet Sue? There was a lot of controversy over her for a while.
NB: I can&#8217;t think what it was about.
KG: The group of women that did the quilt of Sunbonnet Sue, because she was real popular, and they got tired of it and this one group of women, I can&#8217;t remember the name of the place offhand, they did a quilt of Sunbonnet Sue hanging herself and getting killed in a car crash, and trying to kill her off. Do you remember any of that?
NB: No, I do not, but there&#8217;s many forms of, I&#8217;ll say Sunbonnet Sue. Some of them calls it &#8220;Little Dutch Girl.&#8221;
KG: Right.
NB: But you have the ones where, growing up, &#8220;Little Southern Lady,&#8221; and all that. So I don&#8217;t think we could really get rid of Sunbonnet Sue.
KG: No, I don&#8217;t think we could. She was so popular there for a while that that&#8217;s all everybody was seeing, and these women got tired of it. [Laughs] So what was the biggest year that you remember of Uncle Eli&#8217;s? What one year sticks out in your mind above all others?
NB: The fiftieth year.
KG: The fiftieth year. Tell me about that.
NB: What year was that?
KG: &#8217;81?
NB: &#8217;81, yes. That year we wanted to something special, but when we got over there that morning I realized they had quilts hanging from everywhere, and quilts were just hanging. We didn&#8217;t have them identified or nothing. That scared the tar out of me. But everybody received their quilts at the end of the day, and then we set up a check and balance system from then on, displaying quilts.
KG: That&#8217;s a good idea. So what did y&#8217;all do to celebrate the fiftieth year?
NB: Okay, we had this big quilt show. [Pause] My mind is blank. Who was the&#8211;? [Pause]
KG: President, or&#8211;?
NB: I don&#8217;t know&#8211;. [Telephone rings]
KG: Go ahead and answer that. I&#8217;ll stop this.
NB: [Telephone continues to ring] Hello? [Break in recording]
KG: So the secretary of agriculture was Jim Graham.
NB: Yes.
KG: Okay.
NB: And he came over for the quilting party and he brought lots of people with him. And in the afternoon we also had a production of&#8211;. I can&#8217;t think what you call it. This is a group that was going around doing these productions of Eli Whitney. He wasn&#8217;t known just for the cotton gin.
KG: Okay.
NB: He was&#8211;. I can&#8217;t think what you call it.
KG: Was this something he invented?
NB: With guns, uh huh.
KG: With guns. So were they doing a little play or something like that?
NB: Yes, with this&#8211;. This was a group of maybe four boys.
KG: Okay.
NB: And some girls too. Anyway, they stayed in different homes in the community that night.
KG: Were these high school age children or college age?
NB: College age.
KG: College age, okay.
NB: I cannot think where they came from. I can&#8217;t think what you call that type production, where you travel around and do it with no scenery.
KG: With no scenery.
NB: Uh huh.
KG: Well I don&#8217;t know. They weren&#8217;t gypsies.
NB: No.
KG: I&#8217;ll check on that as well. I&#8217;ll have an answer for you when I come back to see you again.
NB: Okay.
KG: I&#8217;ll check on it.
NB: It&#8217;s been so long I haven&#8217;t thought about them.
KG: Now I understand that you taught quilting at Alamance Community College.
NB: Yes.
KG: When did you do that?
NB: That was about 1976, &#8217;75. That&#8217;s when a new interest in quilting began.
KG: Okay. How long did you teach there?
NB: I don&#8217;t know, up till eight years ago.
KG: Up until eight years ago? Now did you teach at the college itself or did you teach out here?
NB: I taught classes everywhere. Everywhere they could find a space that people wanted a class we&#8217;d set it up.
KG: And has that changed a lot since 1975, the way you teach and the people that were coming?
NB: My attitude is still the same, but [Pause] now I realize the way they&#8217;re teaching is everybody working on the same block, type of thing.
KG: Right. And I know you said you would rather&#8211;. You like working on your own stuff. Do you see quilting going more towards that as opposed to people sitting around in a circle working on&#8211;?
NB: A group effort? Yeah, I think we see more of that, people working on their own stuff.
KG: Okay. Now there&#8217;s the big AIDS quilt, and it&#8217;s gotten so big it&#8217;s like in four different pieces.  NB: Right.  KG: Did you quilt a patch for that, by chance?  NB: No. I thought about it but I did not. There&#8217;s a real nice fellow that worked at Student Health that died of AIDS, but I never did work up a quilt in his memory.   KG: Well I know I had a first cousin who passed away with AIDS, and two of my cousins, I&#8217;m not sure if they did it or had someone do it, had him&#8211;.  NB: Included in the AIDS quilt.  KG: Mm hmm, included in the AIDS quilt. Have you ever done a quilt&#8211;? I know some churches will do quilts and they&#8217;ll put the family&#8217;s name embroidered in it and that kind of thing. Have you ever done anything like that?  NB: No, I haven&#8217;t. I am familiar with that type of quilt.  KG: You are just a true quilter.   NB: I don&#8217;t know. [Laughs]  KG: Do your girls quilt?  NB: Wendy, she has surpassed me in quilting. Hers look so much nicer than mine. And Libby has made some. Kathy, if she wanted to she could make one but she hasn&#8217;t wanted to.  KG: I bet they think yours are nicer than theirs though. Now, when y&#8217;all have these quilting parties I know you said that you see black women coming in now. Do they come and quilt as well or do they come and just show their quilts?  NB: Most of them quilt themselves.  KG: Okay. I know I took my children to Uncle Eli&#8217;s back when they were very small and there were several quilts there that when they left there were going over to Raleigh to be displayed in one of the museums. There was a big quilting exhibition over there, exhibit over there, back in the &#8217;80s. Did you ever go see that, late &#8217;80s, early &#8217;90s?  NB: I can&#8217;t remember. I know down at the Research Triangle, I can&#8217;t think of the name of the building, I&#8217;ve been to several nice quilt shows down there.  KG: Okay. Now I understand that Jimmy Carter came to Alamance Community College when you were over there teaching quilting.  NB: I didn&#8217;t see him.  KG: You did not meet President Carter?  NB: No.  KG: Okay. I wondered if you had met him.  NB: No, I haven&#8217;t.   KG: Okay. I&#8217;m going to do one more question for today and we&#8217;ll stop for a little while, and then I&#8217;ll come back to see you and we&#8217;ll talk some more about quilting in a couple of weeks, if that&#8217;s okay with you.  NB: Okay. It&#8217;ll be fine.  KG: Tell me how you think your daughters&#8217; lives have changed compared to your life, and do you think that&#8217;s a good thing?  NB: [Pause] I guess I&#8217;m trying to say it hasn&#8217;t changed a whole lot.   KG: Okay. Can you tell me what you mean by that? Do you think things&#8211;? I mean it&#8217;s a very different world that we live in now, but your girls are still out here in a fairly rural place.  NB: Mm hmm.  KG: But we have a stoplight in Eli Whitney now.  NB: Don&#8217;t we though. [Laughs]  KG: And a Dollar General in Eli Whitney.   NB: And who would ever have thought you&#8217;d go down to the crossroads and pay for a cup of water.   KG: Exactly. That&#8217;s changed.   NB: Well we even go down there and buy water.  KG: Even go down there and buy water, you&#8217;re right. [Laughs]  NB: [Pause] But I can&#8217;t think of any big change between my life and my kids&#8217; lives.   KG: Well have you ever lived in a more urban area, a city?  NB: No, I haven&#8217;t.   KG: Ever had any desire to?  NB: Yes, I think I could try it.   KG: [Laughs] I don&#8217;t think your girls would let you go now. I don&#8217;t they would. So you raised your girls to be independent.  NB: I sure hope I have, if I&#8217;m getting credit for it.  KG: Well you were independent, long before women were really independent. Did you realize that at the time?  NB: No.  KG: No. That&#8217;s just who you were.  NB: Mm hmm.  KG: Well, like I said, I&#8217;m coming back in a couple weeks, but is there anything else that you wanted to share with me today that I haven&#8217;t asked you, or that you can think of?  NB: I can&#8217;t think of anything, and I&#8217;m sure if we play those tapes I&#8217;ll sound like I have led a very sheltered life out here.  KG: Well in some ways, but I also think that you saw a lot of things other people didn&#8217;t see. I&#8217;m quite sure working in Student Health opened your eyes to a lot of things.  NB: Mm hmm.  KG: And it appears that you shared some of those with your girls.   NB: [Pause] Is it still running?  KG: It is. You want me to turn them off?  NB: Yes.  KG: Okay. I&#8217;ll turn them off. I got too comfortable in that chair.
