Paris Vaughn: This is Paris Vaughn and I'm interviewing Ms. Sylvia Ray at the
Center for Economic Empowerment and Development in Fayetteville, North
Carolina. How are you doing today?

Sylvia Ray: Doing great! Thank you.

PV: So can you tell us a little about life growing up?

SR: Well I grew up in a very small town in Duplin County. I graduated from
high school in 1959 and it was, like I said, the town was very small, fewer than 1,000
people. My father was a country doctor. My mother was a homemaker. Course life
was very different. We didn't have television and so we relied on our own mischief
to [PV and SR laugh] have fun. But it was good. You could walk anywhere. People
knew who you were. If you got into trouble, you knew they would report back to

your family. But the school I went to at that time, everything was in one building. We

Sylvia Ray

didn't have kindergarten but we had first grade through high school; it was all in
one building.

PV: So can you describe your parents a little bit?

SR: Well my dad had grown up in Lenoir County, the son of farmers. And he
was the, you know, going to medical school was a big deal. He went to Chapel Hill
and then Tulane in New Orleans. And my mother was a homemaker. She was very
active though with different organizations: garden clubs, things like that. And she
actually was somewhat of an activist until the end of her life. She got very upset at
injustice. But of course the town that I grew up in in that time, the schools were all
segregated. And it was a different life. It was more simple. I read a lot for fun. We
didn't even have a movie theater most of the time. My dad was a typical country
doctor, delivered a lot ofbabies, went to people's houses at night, you know. I grew
up with people who would walk on our door at all times of the night asking him to
come out to see what was wrong with people. And so it was, like I said, a more
simple life, you know. You had one telephone in the house. You were on a party line.
So you know it's hard for my grandchildren to imagine what it was like without
television. And of course there's bad to that and there's good to it.

PV: Right. So what did you do after high school?

SR: I went to Salem College for two years and at that time, a lot of the women
that I knew planned to be teachers or nurses or, you know, to get married. And
nothing wrong with any of those, but I didn't want to do any of it. And so I left and
went to New York City and went to Katharine Gibbs Secretarial School. Graduated

from there and went to work at Elizabeth Arden Sales Corporation, a big cosmetics

Sylvia Ray

firm and worked there several years. And then moved to Atlanta and moved back to
North Carolina where I met my husband. And then we moved to New York. So I was
sort of not traditional even back then because I wanted to get out and explore and,
you know, live in a different place. And I loved living in New York and I still love
New York City.

PV: From working at all those different places, did you ever face any
discrimination for being a woman?

SR: I don't really think so. I think probably the most discrimination was
because I had not finished my college degree. But I will say at that time when I
worked in Atlanta and I went to work for a bank, I lived with a group of women who
had graduated from college. And I know one was told where she worked at this bank
that she could not be, she'd have to be the teller because all the positions had been
filled for women, you know, in a more executive position in the bank. And she's very
very smart. She would have probably been Phi Beta Kappa had that been at Emory
University. But, you know, you just couldn't apply. I don't think I thought about it a
whole lot at that time. It's just sort of the way it was. And of course at Elizabeth
Arden, the woman, Ms. Arden, was the boss. And a number of women were in high
positions there. So I didn't think about it so much. Now it took me a really long time
to think about issues like that.

PV: So what ﬁrst [5:00] sparked your interest in the feminist movement?

SR: Well I had moved to Fayetteville and had two children, and a woman that
I had met through the church had been very active with the National Organization

for Women. She was a minister's wife and so, of course, very non-threatening. I

Sylvia Ray

never really thought about it very much. And she invited me to a meeting and I
immediately--I had been involved with another organization on the issue of child
abuse--and I sort of immediately connected problems within families as somewhat
going back to women's lack of education or power or ability to cope with issues. And
so I became very involved and eventually became very involved in trying to get the
Equal Rights Amendment passed in North Carolina. I met a wonderful group of
women, you know, statewide; still somewhat connected to some of them. And we
worked very hard and it was very sad when it did not pass. It should have passed,
but of course it didn't. It really opened my eyes more to discrimination among races
or, you know, women. And, you know, there have been so many changes now.
There's still a glass ceiling in lots of places and women are still held back. I think a
lot because of having to do with children or other issues.

But when I became involved, though, because I am married to an attorney,
there were a number of people who just thought I was crazy or wouldn't speak to
me because I had stepped out of the role of an attorney's wife, which they thought I
shouldn't be doing. And I didn't want to do, you know. I tried the traditional
women's clubs and organizations and I have a lot of respect for them. But I was
never really happy. I wanted to be doing something to change, to change lives and
whatever.

PV: Right. Is there any speciﬁc moments or events from your working with
the feminist movement that stood out to you?

SR: Wow. [Pause] Goodness. I don't know if any moment. I just felt that there

were so many very smart women and women who really cared about other people.

Sylvia Ray

And that it made me very happy to be part of it. I was away from home some and I
had very young children. Fortunately my husband was very supportive. But I'm sort
of hardheaded so, you know, I probably would have done it anyway [laughs]. And I
took my children with me to marches and demonstrations. And we walked in
Washington and we rode the bus. And it was just nice to be around people who
thought outside of their own little lives and who cared about other people. And yeah
it was very happy. It did change my life. It led me to finding money to start the
center and um, it just--I know when we started here in getting money, a
Presbyterian minister that I knew came up to me and said something like that
you've really found your mission in life and what I'm called to do. And part of it is
my Christianity, my belief that we are all called to do something beyond ourselves. It
is not just about us. Fortunately I've been able to turn it into a career and it's made
me very happy and given me a very fulﬁlled life.

PV: So you mentioned you took your children [SR laughs] with you.

SR: Oh yes.

PV: So how did they feel about what you were doing?

SR: Well they liked it. We were very involved in some of the Democratic
campaigns. They were "Teen Dems" and they enjoyed it. And they have gone on to
be very caring young women. They've participated in events and, you know, raising
money. And they think about things outside themselves. So do their children. Both of
my grandchildren were very sad when the Amendment One was passed. They really
said, my granddaughter who is only four said, "People voted against love."

PV: Wow. [10:00] So what finally motivated you to start the center?

Sylvia Ray

SR: Well I had been very active here. I received a lot of calls from women who
had moved here and did not know where to ﬁnd help because this is a very transient
community. People didn't know that there was sort of a Department of Social
Services. They didn't know there was a domestic Violence center. You know, they
didn't know and I kept saying, "Well here's where you go, here's where you go." And
I had actually gone back to college and ﬁnished my education at Fayetteville State
University and was selling real estate with a friend and another woman from my
church said, "Well you know you've been talking about needing a women's center.
When are you going to start one? I've seen this one in Raleigh and, you know, what
are you waiting around for?"

So I decided in 1989 to go after a grant and ifI got the grant it was a sign that
we needed to start a women's center. If I didn't get it, that would be a sign. I knew
nothing about non-proﬁts. I knew no terminology. I knew nothing! But fortunately, I
had a very good friend who knew about grant writing and she and another woman
and I wrote the grant to start a women's center, to Z. Smith Reynolds. We did a
needs assessment. We interviewed people all over town because our concept was
really to have a resource and referral. We really were not thinking about doing
programs. People could call in and say, "Where do I need to go to get help?" And so
we wrote the grant and received notification in November that we had gotten
$2 5,000. And so immediately we had to put together a board, and a guy here in town
said, "You know that's fine, but you need to raise some more money." So we wrote a

letter to the community.

Sylvia Ray

Now we didn't have an office. We didn't have a computer. We had nothing [all
laugh]. And I kind of stole lists from people [PV laughs] and through my husband's
ofﬁce, fortunately, printed out a letter and we raised $10,000 by the time we opened
in 1990. So we started out very small. Volunteers and, you know, just trying to lead
women to resources here. Immediately became apparent that the big issue was the
economic: jobs, lack of education, lack of affordable housing. And so that's how we
got started.

PV: So what kind of people work here?

SR: Well we have a wide variety of people who work here. We have a fairly
large staff because we have a large housing program which is very unusual. We own
a lot of property. We own houses that we rent with opportunity for people to buy
them: struggling families, you know, who need help getting their credit straight, or,
you know, saving money--that sort of thing--so that they can rent at a lower rent
than they would be charged otherwise with an opportunity to purchase. And we
have a small business center which works with small businesses trying to get
started or expand. And of course we have our displaced home micro-program. So we
are sort of different from a traditional women's center because, first off, we do have
quite a few male clients, still mostly female. But having a business center on site and
a large housing program makes us different. But those are issues of concern, you
know. How do women, especially heads of households, find a safe affordable place to
live? And then maybe they need to start a business because they can't ﬁnd a job or
whatever.

PV: Right. Do you guys work closely with other women's organizations?

Sylvia Ray

SR: We have contacts with them here in town, you know, domestic Violence
center. Not so much with rape crisis at this point. You know, we do have people
coming here looking for jobs who then it turns out that they are Victims of domestic
Violence. But we really work, we're more, you know, we're members of the Chamber
of Commerce. We work with workforce development. Our whole focus here is
economic empowerment: helping people learn how to help themselves.

PV: Right.

SR: To look within themselves to see how they can take care of themselves.

PV: Right. So other than grants and donations, how are you guys funded?

SR: Well we have fundraisers. We have always done a letter at Christmas
time to the community to raise money. And then we have had four Dancing with the
Fayetteville Stars events in the spring, and that's to raise [15:00] money for our
housing program. And that's been very successful. The one we recently had cleared
about $75,000 to go into our housing program, and we had different people in town
who were willing to dance. It's a big event. It's very nice. There's a dinner, you know.
People sponsor tables. First year we had our mayor dance [PV laughs]. And these
are not all people that can dance. They just want to get up and do it to raise money.

PV: Right. Wow. So is there any specific cases or people that you've worked
with while being here that really stood out to you?

SR: Well, you know, I don't really work with clients at this point, but I
certainly did when we started out and I'm aware of the people that come in. You
know, I think [pause], hm, well they're all special, the people that we're able to get

into affordable housing and help them move into home ownership. But there are

Sylvia Ray

many that are special, you know. But I guess that I won't forget because this was
when we ﬁrst opened the first year. We opened in May and I know right around
Christmas time I had come down, we were closed, but I came into the ofﬁce. And I
had a recording on my phone and this woman thanked me. And I wish I had saved it.
And we couldn't really have done a whole lot because we didn't have programs. But
she and her children sang on the phone.

PV: Wow.

SR: And just is the way I defined us. And I thought, you know, this is whatever
we can do it's a good thing.

PV: Wow. Is there any specific changes or anything you would like to see in
the future as far as the women's movement?

SR: I think that particularly women your age need to really understand the
sacrifices that were made, not just in the recent past, by the women in the suffrage
movement who gave their lives, some of them, just like the ciVil rights movement. I
think the African-American community needs to really get in there and be aware
that, you know, discrimination hurts no matter who you are. If you are a gay couple,
it hurts. And we all really need to work together. I mean I think people like me, you
know we still can be active but we really got to count on you guys to get up there
and know how to vote and realize that these rights can be taken away and are being
taken away. In some states, the right to get a legal abortion are being taken away.
And just to know what could happen and it's very scary. You always want things to

be better and not go backwards. I know recently I was watching television about the

Sylvia Ray

obesity problem in this country, and then it said that children in some families will
not have as long a lifespan as their parents.

PV: Wow.

SR: And so it's wonderful having you guys here and that you obviously care.
But really understanding that the people that we vote into power can have some
real effect on your rights, some of the rights of everybody. And to be involved and
understand just like getting the right to vote for women and African-Americans.
That seemed like it was a long time and it seems silly that we couldn't vote. It hasn't
been that long ago.

PV: Right.

SR: And you gotta stay involved and informed.

PV: All right. Thank you. Do you have any other questions?

Kirsten Leloudis: Yeah. I guess would you call yourself a feminist today?

SR: Yes. I think that word has been maligned. What it means to me is that
people should be treated equally according to their gifts and they should never be
turned away. You know, if a woman can do the job equally as good as the man then
she should be paid that. If she can't, she shouldn't; it's just that simple. But it's not
that way. And so I don't, I still like the door to be held open to me. I'm still a
feminine-type person I think [20:00]. You know, I think there are people that think
that it's all women who are rough and crude and whatever and that's not true. We
come from different places and some of us look one way and some another. What
does it matter? We're all caring about other people. And yes, I've been a feminist for

a long time, and some say a radical feminist [all laugh]. I've been called a lot of

Sylvia Ray

things. Trust me. What was it? Oh I know, one time I was called a gay lesbian
abortionist. I thought well that was an interesting combination [KL and PV laugh].
I've been married forty-two years with the same man.

PV: Wow.

SR: And I have two beautiful daughters and three wonderful grandchildren,
so I don't really care what people call me. I know what I am, what I'm trying to be,
trying to be better. I'll be seventy—one tomorrow.

PV: Wow.

SR: And I'm still ready to ﬁght [PV and KL laugh].

KL: Well happy early birthday [PV and KL laugh].

SR: Thank you.

KL: Do you remember at one point in your involvement in the women's
movement that you decided to claim the term feminist?

SR: I would say pretty early on. I would say that probably my Views before I
got involved were probably negative. But once I got involved and saw the kind of
women, and really, you know, it's just like what is right? What is just? It's not
complicated. Is it right for people to be beat on because some people think it's ok? Is
it right to be turned down for a job when you're just as smart. These are just basic
values that I have, I guess came from my Christian faith. But also it's just simple to
me.

And I would say I got involved pretty quickly and I felt, I had tried the more
traditional type of activities for an attorney's wife and I was just kind of [pause]

bored [laughs]. It's not that I didn't think that they were good. Like garden clubs are

Sylvia Ray

wonderful. It just was not me. And when I found this group of women I found where
I needed to be. I have not been involved for a long time because I'm too busy here
and because we get supporters from very different political persuasions because we
work toward helping people learn how to help themselves and that appeals to
everybody. But I'm very glad that I got involved. Yes I'm a feminist. I'm a liberal
feminist, whatever you want to call me. That's who I am.

PV: Wow.

KL: Earlier on in the interview, you mentioned that for a while, even when it
was called the Women's Center, SEED has had male clients. What do you think is the
role of men who would like to be allies to the women's movement? What should
their participation look like do you think?

SR: Well now I would say our clients a lot ofthem know nothing about the
women's movement and nothing about what I've been involved with but there have
always been men who have been supportive of the women's movement. You know
we had a t-shirt one time, "It takes a real man to support a feminist," [KL and PV
laugh]. But, you know, I think the people men who wouldn't be are threatened
somehow, that something’s going to be taken away from them. I'm always amazed,
particularly men in the military, who want their wives to be very subservient and
very dependent. These are men who have gone for months at a time. Who is going to
take care of their children? Who is going to run the household? You know, these
women have to be very tough. Who is going to do it when they're not here? And so I
don't know, you know, we've always had men that have been supportive. And for

men who are not, and from my perspective, it has something to do with their being

Sylvia Ray

threatened, I guess. But it's like anything, whether it's the ciVil rights movement:
white people think that black people are going to take their jobs or something crazy.
I don't know. I can't answer for everybody. I'd like to [laughs].

KL: How do you think that SEED's services and the needs it's trying to meet in
the community are inﬂuenced by the organization's proximity to Fort Bragg, [25:00]
just going on with how close you are to the military base here.

SR: Well we are a very different community because of the military and there
are many good things because of Fort Bragg that come out ofit and there are some
sad things. When you see men who return from overseas who do not wish to be
married to their wives any longer. And they're put back on the community sometime
with children and they're really bad off because Fort Bragg is like a town: everything
is out there. Some of them never leave. So it does make it different than other
centers across the state.

Like I say, there are many good things that come out. We have lots of military
connections right here in the center. We've had a number of women--in fact, one of
our directors of our New Choices program has a husband in them military. And we
have good contacts out there. But it's a difficult lifestyle for families that people
outside don't really understand. Just, you know, can you imagine that your husband
goes off to Afghanistan, or your wife, and you don't know whether they're going to
be killed or come back and you've got young children. It's hard. [Pause] You know I
go back to eat and I look around at men the ages of you two and I think, are you

going to be alive next year? You don't think that when you go out to eat where you

Sylvia Ray

are. You don't look at these people who are obviously in the military and think,
you're twenty-one years old are you going to come home alive?

KL: I think maybe my final question unless Paris has more would be looking
back at your career and your involvement with women's movement, is there
anything you would have done differently?

SR: [Pause] Goodness. [Pause] Well certainly with this non-profit I would like
to have been more aware of some of the pitfalls. I really knew nothing. I mean
nothing. And I always felt that some of the people who were involved with us always
had our best interest at heart, and I realized at some point that they didn't always.
But as one of our board members said one time, "You know Sylvia, people who are
involved with you because of what you do, you're trying to help people. They'll take
advantage." But, you know, that's just part of being involved with anything and
learning. I have tried to tell a lot of people who are trying to start a non-profit, you
know, try to give them some advice from my mistakes. My favorite quote is by Carol
Burnett who said, "I never learned anything from my successes." And certainly
we've made a lot of mistakes here. We've had programs that didn't work. We've had
staff that didn't work out. But it's just part of life, it's part of learning.

But we're at a very good place here, you know. We enjoy, I think, a good
reputation in the community. We have some new exciting plan. I have a fabulous
new staffperson who is our chief operating ofﬁcer. I sort of am half—timing at this
point, sort of. But I know that if anything happened to me, this staff could carry on
and they would be wonderful. And I love all of them. And we do have one guy who

works here [all laugh]. Poor thing, he has to put up with all of us [all laugh]. Yeah

Sylvia Ray

and we have men on our board. We have always had men on our board. I dare say
that there are many women's centers who don't. You know, we have to be in
partnership with people, we have to work together. And, you know, there are men
that care more about our issues than women sad to say. Yeah.

PV: Well is there anything else that you still have on your list, that you would
still like to accomplish in the future?

SR: Oh my goodness! Many things! [PV and KL laugh] Well we're hoping to
open a kitchen incubator, business incubator that would provide space for people to
make products to sell. I mean the issue is always [30:00] trying to find employment
for people that don't have the education or the skills to become employed. Oh I've
got lots of stuff to accomplish but I've got a great staff, and so you know there's
always good to be done. So what is good to me is to send you two young women who
are going to keep on and keep us old people stirred up [all laugh]. I told one of my
daughters I said, "You know when I'm about ninety I'd like to have a cane and be
walking in marches, you know, and hitting people I don't like with my cane" [all
laugh hard]. And then they'll say, "Well that old lady," you know, they'll forgive you
[KL and PV laugh], you know, so you can get away with it. So that would be fun.

And there's always stuff to do. And you know, life is to be lived. Who wants to
sit around and, as my mother said, she'd rather wear out than rust out.

KL: That's a good saying [all laugh].

PV: Well thank you so much. We really appreciate it.

Sylvia Ray

SR: What a pleasure! Yeah, you guys are great. Thank you. I hate my voice. I
sound like Loretta Lynn, you know, just off the turnip truck [PV and KL laugh]. But
anyway, it's what it is. But thank you. Hope it turns out ok!

PV: Thank you.

SR: And let me know how you connect in to all these interviews. It'll be
interesting to hear all these other women.

KL: Deﬁnitely will.

PV: All right.
