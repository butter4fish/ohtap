Liz Lundeen: This is Liz Lundeen of the Southern Oral History Program and today is Monday, August 13th, and I&#8217;m here with Beth McAllister. We&#8217;re at Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, NC. So we&#8217;re just going to get started by talking about your early days growing up. If you could say a little bit about where you were born, about your parents, about any siblings you have.
Beth McAllister: I was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Stayed there, lived there until I was four years old, I believe and then we moved to Charlotte. My father changed jobs. And they stayed in Charlotte until their death.
LL: Oh wow, ok.
BM: Yeah they stayed there a long time. I went to elementary school and junior high school and high school in Charlotte. And then I went to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. When I went, it was Woman&#8217;s College, and I went in the fall of 1959. UNC-G- the women&#8217;s college-was a great place to learn because the people who made the decisions were women. It was a good place to learn how to be an assertive woman. I&#8217;m grateful for that experience.
LL: Absolutely.
BM: I met a fellow named David McAllister who was at Chapel Hill, who was at UNC. And we dated for about a year and a half and then he asked me to marry him. So we got married in November of 1963. Now I don&#8217;t know if you want to talk about the civil rights movement now or wait until later.
LL: Can we talk about a little more about your growing up in high school and stuff and then get to Woman&#8217;s College if that&#8217;s all right?
BM: [Laughs] Sure! I don&#8217;t, you know, I don&#8217;t know what you want to know.
LL: If you want to say maybe a little bit about your parents, how you were raised. You know, did you have an idea of your parents&#8217; political leanings when you were growing up?
BM: Yes. My parents were Democrats. My father worked for the Southern Railway, and Southern Railway had unions. So he was the member of a union. I will never forget that he crossed a picket line, and my mother was very frightened. She went down to the place where the picketing was going on just to be there with him. So they were &#8220;yellow dog Democrats.&#8221; And there were people in Charlotte they knew who ran for political office and they would participate in the campaigns. That was kind of unusual for that day and age, but they did that. As far as the way I was raised, my grandparents lived in Union, South Carolina. Another part of the family lived in Spartanburg where I was born, and [laughs] it reminds me when I think about my family, it reminds me of the Waltons. [laughter] Are you familiar with that?
LL: [laughs] Yeah.
BM: Because you know, we used to all get together at church on Sunday and have Sunday dinner and then go on the front porch and rock and just sort of take it easy. Somewhere in the afternoon there would be a churned ice cream passed out.
LL: Nice [laughs]
BM: You know we were just a very close family is what I&#8217;m trying to say. A very close family.
LL: Absolutely. And so was religion an important part of your life growing up?
BM: Absolutely.
LL: Yeah?
BM: Absolutely. I remember-and this is fresh in my memory because I just talked about it with friends-I slept in a bedroom with my grandmother and grandfather and there was not air conditioning so they had the windows up. And I could lay there in the bed and this beautiful breeze would blow in and it was full of honeysuckle; you could smell honeysuckle. But after everybody went to bed and the house was quiet, my grandmother would come in, and she would set a chair down, and she would get on her knees and she would pray. And I could hear a little voice but basically it was a private conversation between her and God. And I just, I hadn&#8217;t thought about that forever until we, a group of friends were [clears throat] talking about growing up. But no, my parents were Southern Baptists. My father had this beautiful, beautiful bass voice and he was constantly asked to various churches to sing. And most of the churches were Baptist churches. When I went off to college, I &#8220;fell from grace,&#8221; so to speak, and became an Episcopalian.  LL: Uh oh [laughter].  BM: And my father thought I had one foot in hell [laughs]. He was very very upset. But to his credit, he came to my service where I was baptized in the Episcopalian church. It was in my senior year in college. But you asked the question was religion a part of my life, and absolutely. The woman for whom I am [named], Yelena Clinkscales Gary, just did all kinds of things for the church. She was the church lady. She and my uncle formed a couple of churches, those kinds of things. But everybody was a Christian and it was very much a part of their life. The only person that didn&#8217;t have a deeply religious life were my two cousins who still live in Spartanburg. And I&#8217;ve never quite understood why they escaped but they did [laughter]. And we still talk.   I have a brother who is nine years younger than I am; he lives in Austin, Texas. He moved there because his daughter started a medical clinic. She&#8217;s a pediatrician, so he moved there to be with her. It wasn&#8217;t just him that moved, my sister-in-law also moved. But again, one of the first things they did was to find a church. So religion was a very real part of my life growing up.  LL: Yeah, what were the differences in the way that your parents looked at you and your brother in terms of what you would do after you left home? In terms of going to college, for instance.  BM: Right. In my family there wasn&#8217;t the [coughs] there wasn&#8217;t the dichotomy: men will do this, women will do this. In my family, women were very strong. My aunt Yelena for whom I was named ran her husband&#8217;s business. He formed the business but she ran it. My mother was the office manager for an engineering company that had several engineers and she was just a very strong woman. My Aunt Bert, my mother&#8217;s sister, had a business of her own. I mean the women in my family were not shy [laughter]. They were very assertive and very much involved in the community and in careers. And so the message to me was, &#8220;You can do this, you can do anything you want to.&#8221; And my father, to his absolute credit, told me, &#8220;Now Beth, you can do anything you want to do, be anything you want to be.&#8221; I appreciated it and I had the opportunity to tell him that. I appreciate the fact that he supported me in what I wanted to do. Except that Episcopalian thing [laughter]. He didn&#8217;t like that I became an Episcopalian. But I was, I never ever felt like a second-class citizen. I never never did. You know the women in my family came through for me.  LL: Right. So let&#8217;s talk a little bit about, so you were in Charlotte in high school and this would have been [19]50, mid-[19]50s, yeah?  BM: [19]50-um, I graduated in June of 1959.  LL: Ok, so can we talk a little bit about race relations in Charlotte and your high school experiences after the Brown [v. Board of Education] decision comes down. I know integration takes a lot longer than that but I&#8217;m just curious in what your impressions were at the time and looking back as well.  BM: I would say one incident my senior year radicalized me. My mother told me that I was going to have a black woman coming to my high school. That&#8217;s all she said. You know, she didn&#8217;t condemn it. She just said, &#8220;This is the way it is.&#8221; So I didn&#8217;t think much about that until I went to the first day of school. Those of us who were going into our senior year went first to get our schedules. So I went in I got my schedule. I was on the staff of the Harding Highlights, which was our newspaper, and I went in and talked to the advisor of the newspaper. And then when I came out, there were all these people, and I kept looking around to figure out why all these people were here at Harding at my high school. And then, at the end of the driveway that led up to the auditorium, I saw a car. And it was from the United States-I don&#8217;t know what the proper term would be-but anyway these were [federal] marshals.   LL: Wow.  BM: And out came a little black female. People were jeering, people were throwing things at her, they were spitting and I just stood there completely stunned. I had never seen one human being treat another that way. I mean, my family grew up in the South, but they didn&#8217;t condone that kind of behavior. So anyway, a man came up to me-he was later arrested, I think, in Tennessee-he said, &#8220;You want that nigger in your school?&#8221; And I looked at him and I said, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; And he looked at me like I was crazy and had two heads. But that, that was a turning point in my life. Because I went home, I remember going home and my mother said, &#8220;What happened at school today?&#8221; And I explained to her what I had seen. She supported me in what I thought and felt. But I was just stunned. When the young lady went into the auditorium, there was an entrance from the side from the school, so I went around and I went into that entrance. And when she walked into the auditorium - the students started jeering and moving away from her. I watched her eat by herself for two or three weeks. Now the thing that I didn&#8217;t do was eat with her. It didn&#8217;t occur to me to eat with her. But I just, that, that was a turning point in my life. It really did radicalize me because I just, I was a Christian and I couldn&#8217;t condone that kind of behavior.  LL: Now did she stay at that high school?  BM: No, no.  LL: She left?  BM: She left after about a month. And I saw her picture in the paper. Several years ago there was an article about the integration of high schools in Charlotte and in other parts of North Carolina and she was one of the people who was interviewed. She lives in Chicago and she is the principal of one of the schools up there and they interviewed her. Her name is Dorothy Counts. You know and I had to smile and say, &#8220;Well I guess you showed &#8216;em!&#8221; [laughter]  LL: Yeah, exactly. So do you remember growing up, you know, in high school beforehand, did your family - did you have interactions with African Americans with your parents&#8217; work or with the church at all? Or was it that you were aware that there was a separation between the races? You said that you hadn&#8217;t experienced that hatred; that you hadn&#8217;t seen people being hostile toward each other. But I&#8217;m wondering if you still sensed a separation between the races?  BM: My mother worked, as I said, and she had black women that came in and helped her with the housework and they became friends. I will never forget when my grandmother died, Aunt Yelena - the same one - the first person she called was Pauline. Pauline was a black woman who helped my aunt in the house, and that was the first person she called, because Pauline had become family. And I know, I mean this was not talked about a whole lot, but I know that my Aunt Yelena sent Pauline&#8217;s children to school. So as far as being separate, yes there was a line, but there was interaction and there were-. I will never forget when I was a little girl. I loved Pauline, because Pauline played with me. So we were having dinner in the dining room, and I informed my Aunt Yelena that I was going to go eat in the kitchen with Pauline because Pauline had a little set of dishes and flatware in the pantry that were hers. And my aunt looked at me and said, &#8220;Beth you can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; And having been given the freedom to be assertive, I looked at her and said, &#8220;Yes I can! It&#8217;s alright!&#8221; And she said, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t.&#8221; Now my aunt is not used to being told no, so she told me, &#8220;No, no you can&#8217;t, you have to come in here and eat with the family.&#8221;  And I could not understand that. I mean I must have been maybe four or five; I was young. But I&#8217;ll never forget that and I&#8217;ll never forget the fact that my aunt had a little fit because I put my little flat feet on the floor and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to eat with Pauline,&#8221; and off I went into the kitchen. But my mother came and got me.  LL: Yeah, she made you come back.  BM: And I had to eat with the family. But Pauline and her husband were family. They were family. My father, as he was growing up in South Carolina, played with and had black friends, but again there was a line. There was a line that separated the whites from the blacks.  LL: So looking forward I know you mentioned women&#8217;s college. How did you decide to go there? Were you thinking of other places?  BM: I was given a scholarship to a small college, female college, down in Hartsfield, South Carolina. But I went to Girls State, are you familiar with that?  LL: Mm-hmm.  BM: Okay, I was the representative from my high school at Girls State. And it was at the women&#8217;s college. And I loved it. I just loved it. I loved the college itself, but we played politics, you know, and I was the campaign manager for the woman who was running for governor at Girls State.  LL: Oh wow.  BM: I mean women were encouraged to run for office and so forth. I loved it. I loved it. And so I chose that and of course my parents were delighted because it was cheap!  LL: Right, yeah.  BM: It was inexpensive. As colleges go it was inexpensive.  LL: So at Girls State you had mock elections?  BM: We sat in the Supreme Court. We sat in the legislature. All the offices were played out in that setting.   LL: Yeah.  BM: Yeah.  LL: That&#8217;s great. So you started in [19]59.  BM: Yep.  LL: Can you tell us a little bit about what the campus was like, what your first impressions were upon getting there, the environment?  BM: [laughs] My mother and father took me to get me moved into the dorm. And across the campus comes five or six, I don&#8217;t remember how many, black women. And my father-oh my father-said, &#8220;Look at that? Are they part of the help?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No, dad. No. They are students here.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; It hadn&#8217;t occurred to him that these were students and of course if you know anything about the history of the university, they had been integrated for quite some time.  LL: Yeah it was [19]55 I think they had their first African American students.  BM: Yeah and I mean there were not tanks on campus. There were not people standing in the doorways saying, &#8220;No you can&#8217;t come in here.&#8221; So I knew where I was going, but he obviously did not. But that would just tickle me to death and I remembered that through the years. He got used to it. Now my freshman year, I went home with my mother and we were doing some shopping downtown, and up came one of my black classmates. Well we embraced in the middle of Belk&#8217;s department store and I was curious to see what my mother would do. I introduced her, and I didn&#8217;t get any kind of negative feeling from her. She took it all in stride [laughs]. But it was just interesting to watch her. The woman, Gwen Jones, who I hugged in the middle of Belk&#8217;s, has become an artist. She makes quilts. And I&#8217;m sorry to say she died this spring. [coughs] Excuse me. But she was one of the black women. They had all the black women in all one dorm.  LL: I was just going to ask. There were definitely black women students but I was curious about the kind of separation between.  BM: Yeah. Of course they came to the dining hall and did all the stuff that we did but they lived apart and separate.  LL: Yeah. So you had women like Gwen that you were friends with.  BM: Yeah.  LL: And did you-I mean-[19]59, [19]60 was your freshman year?  BM: Yeah.  LL: What sort of awareness of the civil rights movement getting started, what sort of awareness did you have of that? Obviously there were some pretty big events that happened in February of [19]60.  BM: We were called together in [19]60. We were called together as a student body to go to the auditorium and you know the house presidents came around to be sure that all of us were out of the dorm and down in Aycock Auditorium. And the chancellor said that there was a situation downtown that was very volatile and that under no circumstances were we to go downtown, that it would be dangerous for us to do that. He said, &#8220;If you want to help these young men,&#8221; he explained what they were doing, &#8220;you will stay away from downtown and not create hostility.&#8221; He felt like we would inflame the situation. Well, I had just been through integration in my high school and saw history made, and I knew that there was history being made downtown at Woolworth&#8217;s. And so, quietly [laughs] so that no one saw me, I went downtown, caught the bus and went downtown.  LL: By yourself?  BM: Yes, yes I went by myself. I didn&#8217;t want to get anyone else in trouble. I know in retrospect that there are people that would have come with me. That just came to light at one of our reunions about ten years ago. We went down to the museum and saw the counter, the lunch counter and so forth. So I walked down Elm Street, which was the main street, and I decided the chancellor was probably right, because there were all kinds of people there yelling, jeering. There were people all over the place; they were trying to keep some order, but it was hard. It was hard with that mob. A friend of mine who goes here [Pullen Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh, NC]-I don&#8217;t know why she was looking through a newspaper, an old newspaper-and she found a picture of me standing up behind the men who were sitting in, reading a book. I took something with me so that I would have something to do. And I decided that I wasn&#8217;t going to sit down, but I would stand behind these men and try to keep people from hitting them, but the people were doing the same thing that they did at my high school. I mean they were spitting and hitting and putting cigarette butts out, and it was, again, it was a scene that I could not have imagined. As I said, the chancellor was right: it was dangerous for us to be there. Now, there were two white women sitting down with the black men.  LL: And were they from-  BM: UNC-G  LL: The Woman&#8217;s College?  BM: Uh-huh the Woman&#8217;s College, yeah. And I recognized them as upperclassmen. So anyway I stayed for, I don&#8217;t know, for about an hour and I knew I had class. So I slipped quietly out and went back to campus [laughs]. It wasn&#8217;t until many years later, as I said, that we, as a class, discussed it. And the people in my class [said], &#8220;You did that? You went downtown?&#8221; And the woman who was my house president at that time-Emily Herring Wilson at Wake Forest-told me, &#8220;I wish you had told me that you were going down there cause I would have gone with you.&#8221;  LL: Mm-hmm. Do you recall seeing any African American women sitting in as well?  BM: You know I didn&#8217;t see any African American women.  LL: I was just curious from the people, you know, the black women that were at Woman&#8217;s College, but also Bennett as well.  BM: Yes, but I didn&#8217;t see any. There could have been some later.  LL: Absolutely, yeah. So you discussed obviously with Emily [Herring Wilson] years later, but I was curious, did you have discussions with your fellow classmates at the time about the sit-ins or about the movement in general?  BM: Very little.  LL: Uh-huh.  BM: Very little. We did have some conversation but it was certainly not extensive. It wasn&#8217;t a lot.  LL: Mm-hmm. And were there any organizations, any chapters of civil rights organizations in Greensboro that students were a part of, like NAACP?  BM: Not that I know of.  LL: Okay. So I&#8217;ve talked to a couple of other women who went to Woman&#8217;s College [laughter] and they mentioned Warren Ashby as sort of a force to be reckoned with, a philosophy professor. He held meetings in his home with students from Bennett [College], from A&amp;T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical] and from Woman&#8217;s College and so I was wondering if you recall any instances of - either if you knew Warren Ashby while you were there or if you were a part of any interracial dialogues.  BM: I knew who he was. I did not have him for a class.  LL: As a professor, yeah.  BM: I did know that some of my classmates had discussions with him and with others but I was not a part of [them].  LL: Yeah, I was just-it&#8217;s a very interesting story and you know it&#8217;s funny when you hear multiple people mention the same thing in separate settings.  BM: Right.  LL: So, I mean the rest of your years at Woman&#8217;s College-this happened when you first got there-what classes did you take? What major did you end up focusing on?  BM: My major was Sociology. My classes were in the Sociology Department, but my lead professor was Dr. Lyda Gordon Shivers. As far as race is concerned, there were several women, black women, who were in the Department of Sociology who were a part of our professional associations and so forth. But I don&#8217;t remember a lot of interaction. Anyway.  LL: So was this professor you had, was she like a mentor for you?  BM: Yes.  LL: Were there other sort of female professors that sort of served in that capacity?  BM: Dr. Shivers was one. Elaine Burgess, Dr. Elaine Burgess. As far as Doctor Ashby was concerned he was in Philosophy, and I was not in that track so. But that&#8217;s about it.  LL: And what sort of student organizations were you a part of?  BM: Oh my [laughter].  LL: You don&#8217;t have to name them all but if there are any that stick out in your mind that you took a leadership role in.  BM: Yes, I was a member of our student legislature. And then I was junior house president, which was considered to be a very big honor, to be chosen, to be one of the house presidents. And then my senior year, I was a part of the judicial system on campus and it was the-I should have this all down!  LL: [laughs] No it&#8217;s fine!  BM: I should have brought my annual with me because I&#8217;m putting together articles, so I should have brought that but anyway. I was the Secretary of the Court of Social Regulations. I sort of helped run the judicial system and made sure everybody obeyed the rules. And that was kind of funny [laughs].  LL: Considering you had broken one of the rules at the beginning right?  BM: Yeah.  LL: So what kind of infractions came before that court? I mean was it mostly academic stuff, or you said social regulations right?  BM: We had a handbook full of regulations and if you broke one of those then you came before the court.  LL: [said simultaneously] -came before the court.  BM: Yeah came before the court. But it was just so funny because, as I said, I was in a place where I, as you said, I had broken a cardinal rule. I had done something that the chancellor had told me not to do. So, anyway.  LL: So you described your time at UNC-G as between the civil rights movement and the women&#8217;s movement.  BM: Right.  LL: And so I&#8217;m curious if you could say a little bit about how you got involved with the women&#8217;s movement, or even pre-involvement, what you were aware of, when it started happening really in your mind?  BM: In 1963, The Feminine Mystique was published. As I&#8217;ve already said to you, in my family, women were respected and that was the beginning for me, that we were respected and we were encouraged to be whatever we could be. As far as when the women&#8217;s movement started for me, I moved to Raleigh and joined the League of Women Voters, of which Betty Ann Knudsen was the president. It was during that time that the Equal Rights Amendment had come through Congress and was being put out for voting to the states.  LL: Like ratification.  BM: Bonnie Manninger [34:11], I told her this was all her fault. Bonnie Manninger [34:12] is still a very good friend, but she called me up and she said, &#8220;Beth, you know, we&#8217;re kind of tired of hearing the anti-ERA people saying that God is on their side. And that they are mothers and we are not.&#8221; So, she said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to meet over by Meredith College and we&#8217;re going to declare publicly that we are for the equal rights movement and that we are not horrible people, horrible mothers who don&#8217;t, you know, don&#8217;t take care of their children and break all kinds of rules.&#8221; She says, &#8220;I want you to come.&#8221; So, I went and the place was packed! And the speaker, the person who chaired the meeting was the president of the League of Women Voters. I was very impressed with her, so I decided it was time for me to join the League of Women Voters, so I did. Another woman who went to the Woman&#8217;s College - the Reverend Maria Bliss from Asheboro - have you talked to her?  LL: No I haven&#8217;t.  BM: She&#8217;d be a good one for you to talk to.  LL: So she was also at the meeting?  BM: No she was in Asheboro.  LL: Oh sorry, yeah.  BM: But she, at this time, was the president of something called North Carolinians united for ERA. And she asked me- Well, let me back up. We formed a group called Wives and Mothers for ERA to sort of counter this thing of, &#8220;You&#8217;re not mothers, you&#8217;re not anything.&#8221;  LL: Right, and that was the late [19]70s?  BM: Oh, when did I do that? [laughs] Probably.  LL: I&#8217;m thinking because it didn&#8217;t come up in the [NC] legislature until after [19]75, right? So that would be sometime in the late [19]70s.  BM: Right, anyway Maria invited this new organization to become a part of this coalition that had formed. And we had, according to ER America, we had the best coalition, the most effective coalition because there were fifty organizations that came together. They could sit around a table, they could set aside their own agendas and focus on the Equal Rights Amendment. So we joined, and I was the representative [coughs]. I was the representative of Wives and Mothers for ERA. The League of Women Voters was a part of this coalition. Business and Professional Women, Nurse&#8217;s Association, teachers, it was quite a large coalition. To have this group come together to work together to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment was kind of unusual. That&#8217;s why I think ER America thought that we had such a good coalition [laughs], because we could do that. What did I do next?  LL: Well, can I ask about the coalition? Do you remember in terms of - was it mostly white women, was it mostly middle class women? Would you say that the coalition was diverse in terms of class and race?  BM: There were black women. They were members of BPW [Business and Professional Women] and the League. They came out of these organizations. And the women, I would say for the most part were middle class. I mean there were some who had money, but BPW is not made up of wealthy women. It was a diverse group.  LL: Okay. So was ERA the first issue that really got you active in the women&#8217;s movement?  BM: Yes.  LL: And to backtrack a bit, you said you got married in [19]63.  BM: November of [19]63.  LL: And then your son was born in 1970.  BM: Yeah.  LL: So what kind of did you do after Woman&#8217;s College before ERA, if you could just rehash that a little bit and then we can talk more about the ERA?  BM: I taught school. I was a schoolteacher.  LL: You were a Sociology major, so did you teach Sociology classes in school?  BM: No, I taught elementary school.  LL: Elementary school, so not Sociology then. [laughter]  BM: No, not Sociology, no.  LL: Great, and how did you end up in Raleigh? Did you come straight from Greensboro to Raleigh?  BM: No, David and I went to West Lafayette, Indiana where Purdue is.  LL: Oh, Purdue.  BM: Yes, and he went to graduate school and got his master&#8217;s degree while I worked and paid the bills. Then we came to North Carolina, and we were in Greensboro. It was so strange for me. Here I was not too far removed from my undergraduate degree, and here were all these professors saying, &#8220;Call me so and so&#8221; And I thought [laughs], but you&#8217;re doctor so and so! You taught me! Anyway, it was just funny being there in the midst of all of that. So we stayed in Greensboro two or three years and then we went to Chapel Hill where David completed a PhD and I had a baby. I had a mentor in the Sociology department, the school of Social Work. She saw me get in my car getting ready to leave a party. She came over to me and said, &#8220;Why are you leaving? Why don&#8217;t you stay?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well I got to go take care of Tim.&#8221; And she looked at me kind of funny and said, &#8220;Let your husband do that.&#8221; It never occurred to me.  David had a real problem with me being involved in the ERA. I was president of the coalition and I was the spokesperson for the coalition and I was on the phone a lot, and he just he didn&#8217;t like it because he was called upon to be supportive, and he could not do it. So, David and I are no longer married. David is a nice guy, but he just didn&#8217;t have it in his repertoire to be a supportive husband.  LL: When you were married did you plan to pursue a career outside of taking care of Tim?  BM: Yes.  LL: What was that? I know you eventually went back to get a degree in social work, so did you plan to go back to school?  BM: Right.  LL: And was David supportive of that plan?  BM: No, he said, &#8220;How in the world do you think we&#8217;re going to pay the bills if you go back to school?&#8221;  LL: Mm-hmm.  BM: Yeah.  LL: So you were dealing with a lot of these issues that you encountered in the women&#8217;s movement in your life as well. So the ERA was the cause that you got behind.  BM: That&#8217;s right. The ERA got me working on behalf of women and it was great. It was great. We had two marches in Raleigh, and nice girls don&#8217;t march in North Carolina. At one march we had something like 5,000 people, and another march we had something quite close to that. One was in [19]81 and one was in [19]82. You know, it was exciting to be a part of that movement. And now, for example, if I went to Maria&#8217;s house, she would greet me warmly. You were connected for life [laughs].  LL: Mm-hmm. Yeah I&#8217;d imagine.  BM: As I said, Bonnie and I are friends. I think it&#8217;s just like men who go to war, and they&#8217;re always buddies. They&#8217;re always friends. Not that we were at war.  LL: It&#8217;s certainly a battle.  BM: Well it was a battle, that&#8217;s for sure. But we have remained close and when we see one another it&#8217;s just so exciting to be with those people.  LL: Outside of the formal work that you did with the ERA, did you have sort of informal conversations with female friends about some of this injustice against women and the unfairness in your own personal life with your husband?  BM: Yes, yes.  LL: Care to share any anecdotes? Did you meet at a designated time, or was it casual conversation like, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t fair.&#8221;  BM: I have to think [laughter], it&#8217;s been a long time.  LL: That&#8217;s okay.  BM: I don&#8217;t remember a lot of anecdotes. We were just working together for justice. Jill Ruckelshaus-I should bring that for you-Jill Ruckelshaus wrote a statement. And the closing part of it was absolutely moving. I would cry every time I would talk about it. She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m asking you to give your last measure of devotion and to ensure justice for your daughters, your granddaughters, your mothers.&#8221; That&#8217;s a paraphrase [laughs]; it&#8217;s not very exciting to hear that.  LL: No, it&#8217;s great!  BM: But there was a lot of sisterhood involved. That&#8217;s what I remember more than anything was the sisterhood: the feeling of being connected. Some people had husbands that supported them and worked with them like Maria. And then there were people like me whose husbands did not support them. So, we had all kinds of people.  LL: And were there Democrats as well as Republican women in the coalition?  BM: Both.  LL: Ok, so how did you reconcile the political leanings outside of-  BM: We stuck to ERA. [laughter]  LL: You only talked about ERA.  BM: We focused on the issue. A lot of the people were Democrats.  LL: I would imagine.  BM: Yeah I can&#8217;t wait to see what we have next in this country.  LL: Yeah, I hope it&#8217;s not too scary.  BM: It already is scary, I think.  LL: So I&#8217;m curious. You became president of the coalition shortly after you joined it?  BM: Maria was the president of the coalition for a couple of years so I was working with her. And then I was selected to be the president of the coalition. It took a lot of time.  LL: I&#8217;d bet.  BM: Yeah because I was working with men and women all over North Carolina. Up in Washington they had a national coalition and so we were working with all of these people.  LL: And what kinds of - I&#8217;m familiar with the coalition in that it was lobbying the legislature, the General Assembly in North Carolina. But what kind of tactics did they embrace to get voters on its side? Did you use phone calls or direct mail campaigns? Or was that up to the individual organizations within the coalition?  BM: Well the individual organizations did work with their own memberships to encourage them to support the Equal Rights Amendment ratification here. We learned a real lesson, and I was trying to remember what the date was, but the first time the ERA was voted on here in North Carolina we had worked very hard to line up votes. We had an office downtown and we had people who would run that office so we thought we were ready to go into legislature and get the votes; the votes would be there. So the day came in the House and I was just ecstatic! Now Maria was president of the coalition then. And then we went to the Senate. And in the Senate-well a guy ran up to me that I knew. All of these people who were working for the ERA were working together. He said, &#8220;They&#8217;re going to take a vote, Beth, you had better get upstairs.&#8221;  LL: Yeah to the gallery, yeah.  BM: So I went upstairs into the gallery just as they voted, and they voted it down. And they voted it down by a couple of votes. And I was crushed, because I had said earlier to Maria, &#8220;I need to order the champagne!&#8221; Then she looked at me and she said, &#8220;Not yet Beth.&#8221; So McDuffie from Charlotte had promised to vote, when he was running for office, he had promised to vote for the Equal Rights Amendment. And he did not. I rounded a corner to where his office was and there were the women from Charlotte saying to him, &#8220;You will not come back here. We will see to it that you will not come back.&#8221; And he didn&#8217;t. And they were with the Women&#8217;s Political Caucus, another very active strong group.  LL: Were they part of the coalition?  BM: Oh yeah, they were. I didn&#8217;t really talk to anybody that day. None of us did. I went out, I got in my car, I went home, I closed the door to my bedroom and I just wept. I was crushed because I thought we had it. And then you begin to see the things that were given to these men who voted no. This guy got a crane for his community. What else did they get? One of them became chair of the finance committee. Now he lived in Gastonia, and he made Christmas tree models. But anyway, he got his place. And you could just see. Now a lot of people don&#8217;t like Jimmy Greene, who was our Lieutenant Governor, and I didn&#8217;t like him either because he didn&#8217;t support my bill, but at least he told me.  LL: Yeah, he was honest.  BM: He let me know. What we learned is that you cannot depend on people. You have to be sure, and the only way to be sure is to elect them; that&#8217;s what happened with McDuffy. So we put together a movement to put enough House and Senate members on our side to support the bill and ratify. We had an office downtown again and Betty Ann [Knudsen] called me and said, &#8220;Beth, there&#8217;s a young woman who has moved back to Raleigh and I think she would be really really good to work with you. Her name is Anne Franklin she&#8217;s right here.&#8221; So I called Anne and I said, &#8220;Come on in and let&#8217;s see what you can do.&#8221; And she obviously knew how to organize. So the next day - she was in Hickory, North Carolina - and Betty Ann and I traveled together. So we&#8217;d leave on Monday night or Tuesday morning and we&#8217;d go to the community and hold a rally and we&#8217;d speak and meet with the leaders and tell them how to put together a winning campaign. We just worked the politics. We just worked it. I have a good friend in Lenoir, North Carolina; Betty Ann wanted him to run [laughs]. She felt like he would be a good candidate, and he really would, but he didn&#8217;t want to run for office, but we went to his home and spent the night with him and with his wife. So there was just a lot politicking.  LL: And was there any effort to get any women elected?  BM: Absolutely.  LL: Or was it mainly men who would support the ERA?  BM: Both. But absolutely, we wanted women to do it. And the Women&#8217;s Political Caucus, I can&#8217;t say enough about them, because they footed the bill, you know. They were the ones who helped me and Betty Ann go around the state. Ha, I&#8217;ll never forget [laughs]. It was funny to go with the people from Washington. We were headed out to the Pamlico Sound in Eastern North Carolina, and the woman in the backseat was from the Nashville coalition and she was very quiet. She kept looking around and she looked at me and said, &#8220;Where are the people?&#8221;  LL: Oh wow. [laughter]  BM: I said, &#8220;Just be patient, we&#8217;ll get there.&#8221; So we did, we did. And we recruited a woman who I think had been mayor of Aurora, North Carolina, and she won. But lord knows. I mean the woman who asked me, &#8220;Where were the people?&#8221; I mean she was right. We didn&#8217;t see any until way out toward the Pamlico Sound. If I sat down and thought I&#8217;m sure I could tell you a million stories [laughs] but right now I just can&#8217;t think of a whole lot of them.  LL: Now so you went through this process a couple of times, trying to get people elected and coming back during the long session hoping somebody would bring back the bill, and then losing, trying to get people elected. I think that cycle probably happened.  BM: Yes.  LL: From [19]75 through [19]80 because the final due date was [19]82 right when it had to be ratified. What was that like? I mean the continual cycle of campaign and defeat?  BM: Well I learned a lot. I learned a lot about politics.  LL: Sounds like it, yeah.  BM: I learned about [pause]--what would I call it--how to work together.  LL: Mm-hmm.  BM: How to really work together for a cause. And it was disheartening, to be perfectly frank. We had three cycles and the cycle that I talked about with the Speaker of the House on our side. We won that one; we only won one house. But I just I learned about people. Alan Alda came and he--this was so funny--ER America called me and said, &#8220;Beth, who is this woman that has called us and wants Alan Alda to come?&#8221; And I laughed and I said, &#8220;Well she&#8217;s secretary of the coalition.&#8221; &#8220;Do you know her?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I know her, and she thinks Alda&#8217;s presence would make a difference.&#8221; &#8220;Well are you willing to put things together?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Sure! If he&#8217;s willing to come, we&#8217;re willing to put it together.&#8221; So he flew into the Norfolk airport and came to Eastern Carolina, Northeastern Carolina. The biggest building in this little town, Elizabeth City, was the high school cafeteria. So sitting on the stage were the musicians, and they played the Alan Alda theme that they always played on MASH. And first we went to a woman&#8217;s home where we had a fundraising dinner, and I asked him-people were wanting his attention so he couldn&#8217;t eat--I asked him, I said, &#8220;How do you do this day in and day out?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I&#8217;m here for a reason. To give them all my time until we&#8217;re finished.&#8221; So anyway we did that. Then we went to the cafeteria and had the public thing and the people went wild! I mean he was just sort of engulfed. I was afraid that they were going to hurt him! [laughter] And then we went back to the motel. The next day, we had lunch with some very powerful Senate and House members and spoke to them. He spoke to them. One of them, Monk Harrington [State Senator Joseph Julian &#8220;Monk&#8221; Harrington], came up to me and put his arms around me and said, &#8220;Little lady, if you want something out of the legislature you just come and talk to Monk, Uncle Monk.&#8221;   LL: Oh my.  BM: And I thought, &#8220;You so-and-so&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m in church! [laughter]  LL: Mm-hmm.  BM: And Alan Alda heard that. So we drove Alan Alda from Eastern North Carolina to Raleigh for another fundraiser and on the way down we talked a lot about the amendment and the political climate. And he said, &#8220;How do you stand that? That condescension?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221; But I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m like you, I&#8217;ll put up with it if it means that we&#8217;re going to get their vote.&#8221; Of course we didn&#8217;t get their vote. I knew they weren&#8217;t going to vote. So anyway we went to Scott Pavilion out at the fairgrounds we had this huge rally. He spoke with the press, he had a press conference, but it didn&#8217;t help. It didn&#8217;t help.  LL: And do you remember any sort of dividing lines within the coalition, things that people didn&#8217;t agree on? Or would you say that everyone dedicated so much to the cause that no rifts kind of came to the fore?  BM: Pretty much they were together in what they were doing. Now, and I don&#8217;t mean this to be a derogatory statement, but my understanding is that NOW [National Organization for Women] was difficult. They wanted to be the leaders, they wanted to be on top and tell us all what to do. But they weren&#8217;t able to take me on, and not because I was all that tough; but because they knew that people trusted me. That was the bottom line. I&#8217;ve had friends tell me since then that the reason we were so successful in North Carolina and almost got it was, &#8220;because people trusted you.&#8221; But after we went down in defeat again, I left the coalition. [laughs] I walked into the restroom in the YWCA and one of the ladies from the coalition was crying. And I said, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so sorry you&#8217;re upset,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;You&#8217;re leaving! Do you have cancer?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;No, I just need to move on,&#8221; because it was about that time that David and I started our divorce proceedings. And also I needed to go to work. I went to work at hospice. I was hired to work on the hospice program here in Raleigh.  LL: Now did you already get your master&#8217;s in social work or did that come later?  BM: No, that came later. One of the main reasons why I got it was that I realized - I was at hospice for nine years - and I realized that if I were going to do anything else, I was going to need that master&#8217;s degree. That was just a given.  LL: So you left the coalition for personal reasons, and you needed to focus on some other things. If you care to share, could you say a little bit about your husband&#8217;s reactions? Was he looking after your son when you were doing all the campaigning? Or did you need to make other arrangements for your son when you were doing a lot of the campaigning?  BM: I&#8217;ve said this to my son. I wish that I had had more time with him to help him understand what I was doing. Now he marched with me. The first time we had the march, though, David took him fishing, you know. The second time, he came down and marched with me. And now, in retrospect, he&#8217;s very supportive of me. But David didn&#8217;t like having me out there. And it was interesting because after we separated, I had people tell me that they were very aware that David was not there and present and supportive. And they just couldn&#8217;t understand why he wasn&#8217;t there with me, because some of the other women of course, like Mariah, had husbands who supported them. And they were there; they were at rallies and supported them.  LL: Did you stay involved with the coalition, with the ERA after you left as president?  BM: Not a whole lot. I really was working with the League.  LL: Yeah then can you say a little bit about the League, then? Were they still in favor, for the cause of the ERA? This would have been the early [19]80s?  BM: Right.  LL: Yeah.  BM: And of course the ratification effort failed so there really wasn&#8217;t a ratification effort. People have asked me over and over again, you know, &#8220;Are you willing to do it again?&#8221; And I tell them, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll have to think about that.&#8221;  LL: Yeah. It&#8217;s a lot of time and effort.  BM: Well at that time I was in my forties and it was easy. My life is a little different now!  LL: I was wondering if you could say anything about the opposition?  BM: Oh good lord! Let me, let me tell you a story. You&#8217;ve triggered a story. I got a call from WRAL and they wanted me to come down and talk. And they were going to have an anti-ERA person. So I told them sure, I&#8217;d be glad to do that, because I did this all the time. The woman that they chose was Marilyn Devries. I don&#8217;t have [any] idea if she&#8217;s still in Raleigh. So Marilyn and I went down to WRAL for this taping and we went through the usual discussions and pros and cons and then it was over. We started walking down the hall, and she ran to me. She said, &#8220;Beth, you&#8217;re different from these other women.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Marilyn what do you mean?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I believe if I invited you to my home and we sat down and we had a cup of coffee, I could show you where the ERA will damage the family.&#8221; And I looked at her, and I very seldom use my religion, but I looked at her and I said to her, &#8220;I am a born again Baptized by immersion Baptist, and if I thought that the Equal Rights Movement was going to harm the family and harm my community, I could not support it. I just [couldn&#8217;t] do it.&#8221; But that just, good lord! PBS made a, do you know about this? PBS made a special.  LL: No.  BM: Yeah you need to call Vicki [Victoria] Costello at PBS. I think I&#8217;ve got a copy at home; in fact I&#8217;m sure I do.  LL: This is about the ratification in North Carolina?  BM: Yes, and they followed Marilyn Devries and they followed me. Vicki Costello came down the hall just as me and Marilyn were talking and they just whirled away. But I thought, &#8220;Marilyn you don&#8217;t understand it. You don&#8217;t understand where I&#8217;m coming from.&#8221; A lot of the groups that belonged to the coalitions were faith groups. Mariah was a Methodist minister. You know a lot of faith-based organizations, and Marilyn just didn&#8217;t understand.  LL: I imagine there were a lot of labels thrown on everything you said.  BM: Oh yes [laughs] oh yes, yes.  LL: So did you identify with the term feminist at that time?  BM: Yes, I am a feminist. I was and I am.  LL: Can you say a little bit about what being a feminist means to you?  BM: Let me think just a second [laughs].  LL: No problem!  BM: I think a feminist is someone who loves and cares about women and their children and is a person who is willing to support women in their efforts to create a healthy life for themselves and their family, their community. You know, feminist took on a negative connotation, but to me it&#8217;s not negative and never has been. And, of course, who was it that termed the phrase, &#8220;womanist?&#8221; Was that Alice Walker?  LL: Yeah I think it has a couple meanings as well, yeah, yeah in the [19]70s.  BM: [sniffs] Excuse me, for some reason my nose is dripping.  LL: I think some of those things in the air are starting to come out. Allergens in the fall season. I&#8217;ve been feeling the same way. Well can you say a bit about your social work career? I know you worked in hospice for nine years before you went back to get a master&#8217;s.  BM: Yes.  LL: Did you see your work in social work as connected with your work in the women&#8217;s movement, or at least with your fundamental beliefs about feminism?  BM: Yes, in the sense that I had a master&#8217;s in social work and I was committed to helping people put their lives aright, and women were a large part of that. And a lot of the professors in the school of social work were very supportive and I had seen them at the rallies. You know, I knew them, and they were so supportive and I couldn&#8217;t have asked for better support.  LL: Yeah, I&#8217;d imagine. One of your mentors, I know you mentioned Betty Ann Knudsen, can you talk a little bit about your relationship with her? For the tape, she&#8217;s just recently passed.  BM: Yes.  LL: And was she older? How much older was she?  BM: Betty Ann was about twelve years older than I am. She was eighty-five.  LL: But definitely was kind of a mentor, a role model.  BM: Yes, yes.  LL: Can you say a little bit about your relationship?  BM: Well [laughs] she helped me believe in myself! You know, she made it real clear: there&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t do if you are committed and really put your mind to it. When my mother died, excuse me. [pause] When my mother died, she went off suddenly. She was fifty-nine. One day I went to the mailbox and there was an envelope with butterflies, which is Betty Ann&#8217;s symbol. It had the colors orange and yellow. So I went inside, I opened the envelope, and I took that butterfly-. Sorry.  LL: That&#8217;s ok. Do you want me to turn this off for a minute?  BM: No. And in that, in that envelope [with] that butterfly, Betty Ann said, &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry about your mother passing, but know that she has broken out of the cocoon and that she is touching everything with beauty.&#8221;  LL: Wow, that&#8217;s beautiful.  BM: That&#8217;s the type of person Betty Ann was and she did that. I am amazed. She did that for everybody. She was known as a community leader. She was the first woman to serve on the county commission, first woman to be the chairman of the county commission. And that&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s Betty Ann. Betty Ann was very committed to this community and did wonderful things for us but she also was the kind of caring person, friend, that would send you a butterfly. She&#8217;s just amazing. Excuse me; I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t know I would get so emotional.  LL: No, no, she&#8217;s very important and that story is beautiful.  BM: Excuse me.  LL: How do you think, and maybe you know the same is true for Betty Ann, but how has being in the South and being a Southerner affected your activism, your belief system? I mean I know there are other fellow Southerners who don&#8217;t share those beliefs as far as the women&#8217;s movement goes. But I&#8217;m just curious if you see anything about a southern flavor toward women&#8217;s activism or how you see the women&#8217;s movement playing out in the South? What was unique about it? Or, what wasn&#8217;t unique about it?  BM: To answer that question requires some thinking.  LL: Yeah it&#8217;s not an easy one.  BM: And this is from my perspective, of course, but I always found that women were respected in the South. As I said, in my family, women were respected, you know, they were supported. But I don&#8217;t know if I can pinpoint for you a way in which the women&#8217;s movement in the South is unique.  LL: Maybe if you can just say a little bit about [how] religion was very important to you?  BM: Yes.  LL: But there were people on the other side of the ERA, for instance, that also thought of religion as critical to their views. How did you reconcile that? How did you reconcile the fact that this woman in the hallway was saying to you, you know, if I could basically change your mind based on how the ERA is going to hurt the family.  BM: Well, a little note, Marilyn Devries was from up north [laughter]. She was not a Southerner. Well it&#8217;s the same struggle that we&#8217;re having now with gay marriages. You know this is the same thing. The Equal Rights Amendment was one of those issues that really splits the church, you know, and it just takes work to help people understand what religion means in this kind of situation. As far as I was concerned, religion was very much a part of the ERA. I believe that you want to do justice and love mercy and practice kindness and that includes what we&#8217;ve been talking about. Excuse me.  LL: After the ERA were there other causes related to the women&#8217;s movement over the next couple of decades that you were involved in or that you identified with?  BM: When I got my degree, I was asked to develop an agency called Summit House, which was for women and children, trying to keep women out of prison. And I see my social work as a part of a justice movement. So in a sense, yes. There were other things that I did.  LL: Can you say a little bit about Summit House?  BM: Summit House is a private non-profit agency. It was established to work with women and their children to give women a place to live, a structure to help them overcome drug addictions and create a new life for them and their children.  LL: Very much connected I can see. So I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s any insight you can offer, any take away messages. We&#8217;ve already alluded to that we&#8217;re in another sort of critical moment. There are a lot of efforts even in this upcoming presidential election to take away certain rights for women.  BM: Yeah.  LL: You know, what do we do now? That&#8217;s not an easy question by any stretch of the imagination but you&#8217;ve been through these battles before so I&#8217;m just curious if you have insight to offer young feminists.  BM: You keep the faith. You keep the faith. You have confidence in yourself, in those that you love, in your church, and you keep the faith.  LL: Do you have anything else that you&#8217;d like to talk about that we haven&#8217;t hit upon?  BM: No. No not really. I hope I haven&#8217;t left something out that&#8217;s crucial.  LL: No you&#8217;ve said a lot and that&#8217;s been great to get sort of the nitty gritty on the ERA struggles and I appreciate that.  BM: Well you&#8217;re welcome.  LL: Great. Should I go ahead and turn this off?  BM: Yeah   [Pause in recording]  [Recording resumes]    LL: This is Liz Lundeen. I&#8217;m back after a short break with Beth McAllister and we&#8217;re just going to talk about another aspect of her work over the years with the AIDS service agency.  BM: I got involved with the AIDS service agency through my church. It was a religious thing, a faith thing.  LL: Was that here at Pullen [Memorial Baptist Church]?  BM: Here at Pullen.  LL: Ok.  BM: Of course it was a matter of justice at that time because so many of the AIDS patients were being discriminated against and were not being recognized. So I became a member of the board of the AIDS service agency or the board that formed the AIDS service agency and put together a service agency that would help the AIDS patients get what they needed. And it was just, I wish I could remember more about that. But the AIDS service agency is still very active. And they are doing really good work in this community. But I was a member over several years helping to get them started. I was president of their board and I was helping them lay out a business plan and so forth. Anyway, it was a really good experience.  LL: And did that grow out of Pullen or was that related to your social work?  BM: Well I think it was both. It was both.  LL: Yeah, that seems to gel really well. Actually that made me think of another question that maybe would be great for the tape. Could you say a little bit about Pullen, the values it stands for as a church, and the social justice work that it does that you got involved with?  BM: Ok, Pullen Memorial Baptist Church has been in Raleigh for I think it&#8217;s been 184 years. I don&#8217;t have my calendar with me, but it&#8217;s always been a congregation that has stood for justice. First of all, we opened the doors to women in leadership positions and that just wasn&#8217;t done. The next step was to open the doors to African Americans. They came to church here. They were in the choir. They came to Sunday Schools. They were in the services. And once again, we shook the roots, the foundation. Other Baptist churches thought we were just wild radicals.   And then, two young men came up to our minister and requested that he marry them or that he join them in holy union, and he said, &#8220;No,&#8221; that he needed to go to the congregation and see what they thought we should do. And so over the course of many months, there were house meetings, there were congregational meetings to discuss what our stand was going to be on this very sensitive issue. By that time, most people accepted women in leadership positions. They accepted most African Americans. But this, this was a different thing; this was more serious. Or at least that was what people felt. After all that, there was a congregational vote, and, lo and behold, the congregation voted very much, very strongly, in [favor of] doing this holy union. So ever since that time, Pullen&#8217;s ministers have carried out holy unions. They have just taken a stand that the church will not marry anybody until we can marry everybody, again keeping with the equality and the justice thing.  So after we voted to do holy unions, we were asked to leave the Southern Baptist convention and so we did. We had been waiting, quite frankly, for somebody somewhere to say, &#8220;they need to go.&#8221; But if you feel like you&#8217;re hearing a little pride in my voice, I am proud of my church because they have stood for justice forever and this is probably the only church I can belong to. Maybe not. Maybe there are some others out there but this one is very special to me because of the stand that they have taken for justice and equality.  LL: And women&#8217;s leadership too.  BM: Women&#8217;s leadership. Absolutely.  LL: That&#8217;s probably part of that. You have a woman minister right now.  BM: We have a woman minister. Right.  LL: Well thanks, that&#8217;s great!  BM: You&#8217;re welcome. Thank you.
