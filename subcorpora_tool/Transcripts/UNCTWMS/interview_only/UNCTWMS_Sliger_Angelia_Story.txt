JW: This is Jessie Wilkerson and I am in&#8212;are we still in Unicoi?
AS: We&#8217;re in Johnson City.
JW: We&#8217;re in Johnson City, Tennessee. The date is May sixteenth, 2011, and I&#8217;m here with, your full name is&#8212;  AW: Angelia Story Sliger.   JW: Okay, Angelia Story Sliger, daughter of Gail Randolph, who I just interviewed a little while ago. So could you first tell me a little bit about your childhood?  AW: I grew up in Bumpus Cove. Most of my dad&#8217;s family still live in the outer skirts of Bumpus Cove. We lived in the upper part of the Cove that was near the landfill. We lived in a log house. I don&#8217;t think we had running water. No, we didn&#8217;t have any running water. I remember, we carried the water to the log house. Things were a lot more simple. People think that I&#8217;m not old enough to have lived and not had running water and electricity, but we did. When we grew up there, we grew up swimming in the river and all of my family lived up in there. So it was very close. I call it &#8220;clansy&#8221; because we were all related. It was kind of hard because I was the oldest girl. So I had to help with the younger ones, and I had to go to work when I was fifteen.   Then I spent most of my teen years at the Bumpass Cove Citizens Group Center because that&#8217;s where most of the meetings went. That&#8217;s where plans to take actions happened. I wound up babysitting all the little kids while my mom and dad was meeting with all the families. (laughs) It was different in that time because there was a lot of times that it was very scary during my mom and dad&#8217;s activism of trying to shut down the landfill. There was times that I know that they were desperate to get to stop a lot of the trucks to go up into there. I remember that one day, there were trucks that were coming through Embreeville to go to the Cove, and all of the families got all of us kids together and we all stood in the middle of the road and held hands and wouldn&#8217;t let the trucks go past us. And of course, they&#8217;re going to stop because it&#8217;s children. There wasn&#8217;t small children, but we were all probably ranged from five to eighteen. I was about thirteen, I guess, fourteen at the time. It was very scary to us because of a lot of the things that was said. I remember one of the truck drivers getting out and making lots of threats to move out of the way and yelling at our parents. It was scary. Of course, our parents got us out of the road with them and they continued on.   I remember when my Uncle Hobart had went up onto the landfill and had hidden in the woods and videoed some footage of Waste Resources or one of the companies that were up there with a backhoe. I remember watching the video with him. They were digging at these barrels, and when they would hit the barrels with a backhoe, it was busting holes in them and it was stuff flying everywhere. That&#8217;s when we weren&#8217;t allowed to play in the river no more. That&#8217;s when every time it would rain, we would go down to the riverbank and the water that was coming from the direction of Erwin would be the greenish-blue river color and then the water coming from Bumpus Cove where we lived, coming down, was solid black. And so when you stood on that Embreeville bridge, you literally, the river looked like two stripes coming down the river and it was a black side and a green side.   I remember a lot of people, well, a lot of people got sick. And when the students came from Vanderbilt to do all of the health screenings on all of us, there was one word that stuck in my head that when I got older, I researched to find out what it meant. When they tested the water, they said they had found something called &#8220;trichlorethylene&#8221; and that word just frightened me for some reason and I didn&#8217;t know what it was. So when I got older and started using the computer and using the internet and stuff, and found that that was a chemical that was used in washing car parts and it was found in our water, our drinking water. I don&#8217;t know why that was the one. I remember there was a list of things that they had found, but that was the one word that just always stuck in my head for some reason. So it just always bothered me. So when I researched it and found what it was, then I really, I think, at that time, realized just how serious that was then.   I was still young enough that I wasn&#8217;t involved in the actual meetings or anything like that because they were too busy needing me to watch the kids so they could meet. (laughs) But there was a lot I did see and hear. It&#8217;s really--you can&#8217;t forget things like that. I went fishing with my dad a lot and we would go down to the river, which we didn&#8217;t fish in it no more, but if we went down to just throw rocks in or something, there would be dead fish laying everywhere along the banks floating. My uncle, when he did the walk up on the landfill, he had videoed the stream coming out of the mountain down from the landfill, between the landfill and the river, and he had videoed, there was a dead baby deer. There was a couple of dead rabbits. There was lots of dead fish everywhere. And I remember seeing that video and hearing him talk about it and hearing him and Dad and Mom talking about how dangerous this was.   And ironically, every single one of us that grew up there have had cancer, have had children with disabilities, or have died. My cousin, Linda Walls, she passed. She actually worked here with me and she died a few years ago. She was in her 50s. Her sister died back in the [19]70s of a brain aneurysm. Linda died of a stomach aneurysm. Her daughter, Amy, she had cancer at the age of seventeen maybe, couldn&#8217;t have any children. I had cancer when I was twenty-nine and then just this past August, I had uterine cancer and had to have another surgery. My daughter was born with cerebral palsy, mental retardation, scoliosis, several other diagnoses. My cousin, Travis Rogers, which is Russell and Mary Lee&#8217;s son, that was part of the Bumpass Cove Citizens Group, his son was born with severe autism and mental retardation. Pretty much every one of us. My sisters have had bouts of cancer. Mom&#8217;s had cancer.   And nothing [that says] that it definitely goes back to what we were drinking and growing up in, but ironically, I was having lots and lots of stomach problems after I had moved from Bumpus Cove. And I had them for years, and it got to the point that I couldn&#8217;t eat or drink. I became very, very sick about twelve years ago and the gastrologist actually sent me to the University of Virginia for three or four days for some tests, and they had discovered that I had helicobacter pylori, which is a gastric disorder. The doctors at the University of Virginia stated to me that that is mainly caused from drinking contaminated water. He didn&#8217;t even know where I was from. So then he asked me if I had cistern or well water and I told, I said, &#8220;Currently, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But I have had both.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But I&#8217;ve had these problems with my stomach since I was a child.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, did you grow up with cistern or well water?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;I grew up in Bumpus Cove.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Well, that answers my question.&#8221;   So what this disease did to my stomach is put me on a lifetime of stomach pills, lots of bleeding in my stomach. It deteriorated the stomach lining, the lining of the wall of my stomach. Lots of things I can&#8217;t eat because it just totally messed up my--. [It] causes so much acid reflux that it dissolved part of my esophagus, and so I have to have it stretched open every couple years. They have to put me to sleep and go down to stretch it open because the acid from all of that just kind of comes up and dissolves, has eaten up the layers. I was told by them that that was caused from drinking the contaminated water.  And of course, back then, my family wasn&#8217;t educated enough to know to get me tested for staying nauseous or vomiting: &#8220;There&#8217;s lot of home remedies we&#8217;ll give you and it&#8217;ll get you through it.&#8221; And when you&#8217;re a kid, a lot of times it&#8217;s not as bad, but as I got older, it got worse. So that kind of made me feel like that that was another thing that we get to live through after it&#8217;s all said and done.  JW: But it&#8217;s not all said and done on your body.  AS: Well, on my body, exactly. It was ironic that the doctor had told me this because when he started telling me how you get this and the shape that my stomach and my intestines were in, he&#8217;s like, &#8220;This has to be you&#8217;ve had this for years.&#8221; Because it apparently had really messed my organs and things up and had just really torn my stomach up, because I had gotten to the point that anything I ate came back up. So after I had told him that I grew up in Bumpus Cove, he pretty much knew. He said that he strongly felt that from drinking the water up there would have caused lots of lifelong damage to your body.   Pretty much, both my sisters fairly have stomach issues. There&#8217;s lots of things that they can&#8217;t eat. It&#8217;s not as bad, but I do know that they both still have issues with things.   JW: Do you remember the first times you got sick, as a child getting sick?  AS: Well, I, for years, thought that it was a nervous stomach, that it was from my nerves, just being nervous. When all the things that were going on at that time and they were trying to get the trucks to stop, there were so many things that happened. That just made us very scared and I stayed kind of nervous a lot. So for years, I honestly just thought it was from being nervous and then, of course, when it got worse, I found out it was not just nerves, but it was an actual bacteria in my stomach. I guess it was around when I was seven, eight years old, maybe a little older, when I started feeling--. I&#8217;d get out of bed and I&#8217;d be nauseous, and I would try to eat something and I could start feeling it. And like I said, for years, until I really started getting old enough to question things, I just always thought it was a nervous stomach.   My daughter is the same way because she does have a nervous stomach, and she has a spastic colon. So when she gets nervous, she gets nauseous and gags and sick, but she also has a lot of health issues, too. My brother that lives in Maryland now, his son was also born with severe disabilities. He was born with cleft palate, no chin. He is nineteen and has already undergone thirty-some surgeries, I think. My cousin, Steven, who grew up in the Cove with us, was born with heart birth defects. He had to undergo numerous heart surgeries and some other kind of surgery when we were younger.   Oh gosh, there are so many. I know there&#8217;s been numerous, numerous people that have died up there at very young ages for aneurysms, which is kind of scary. I don&#8217;t know that that can be caused by that, but it&#8217;s just kind of ironic. I&#8217;m talking not just one or two, but I&#8217;m talking five or six different people have died that live just in that cove of aneurysms bleeding. It&#8217;s just kind of scary that that&#8217;s just they all happened to live in the same Cove when it&#8217;s such a small community.   JW: And do people still talk about the health effect that the landfill had on people or is it something that you deal with individually now?  AS: Well, me personally, I&#8217;ve dealt with it individually because I work all the time and I really don&#8217;t get to go visit my family over there much. But I do know that there has been numerous other issues with other people. I can&#8217;t say exactly what. A lot of people still live in the Embreeville area. I know in Bumpus Cove, pretty much all the houses are gone. I have one uncle that still lives up where he always did in the Cove. He&#8217;s probably the last house up in there now. He seems to be fairly healthy and he&#8217;s older. So I don&#8217;t get to see him much. I do know that, over the years, people that grew up there and those of us that lived there have had numerous health issues that was pretty much unexplainable, but could be related back to contamination.   And my daughter has seizure disorder also and so does my cousin with the autism. I was told when I took [her to] Shriner&#8217;s Hospital, and they had did some tests on her for the cerebral palsy, I had talked to a nurse there. We had got to talk. She knew about Bumpus Cove, and we had gotten to talking about the different things that had went on there and from my understanding, at one point, she had come to Bumpus Cove and was one of the students that had come and helped with the health screenings on us. I just asked her. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wondered if maybe a lot of Bianca&#8217;s disabilities now has come from the damages or health issues that I got or had gotten from growing up there.&#8221; And she said that it would not be surprising.   Disabilities have run through my family that&#8217;s lived in that Cove pretty rapid. A lot of them were uneducated, but there was a severity of seizures and the autism and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. There&#8217;s just a lot of health issues that I found could have related back to the way we lived growing up and drinking the contaminated water and the things that it caused.  JW: So during that time, what was it like to go to school and be around other kids who maybe their parents were active in everything that was going on?  AS: Well, I remembered, of course, with me being one of the older kids, I remembered it was an embarrassment to me, not because of my mom and dad. I wasn&#8217;t embarrassed of my mom and dad or what they were doing. I was very proud of the fact that they were&#8212;to be someone that was uneducated that could fight such large companies like Waste Resources and as I always say, &#8220;Mean what they say and say what they mean.&#8221; But the embarrassing part was that there was Waste Resources and some other, I know that there was some other companies involved, had started some stuff in the newspapers and the local news about my parents being communists and just trying to really deface their character when all they were doing was trying to fight for their community.   It was hard because some of the people that lived out of the community didn&#8217;t understand and so, of course, kids hear things at home, they come to school, they say things, that aspect.   But I learned with a lot of it, I&#8217;m very opinionated like Mom, so I really didn&#8217;t care what they thought. But it was still the point that, I remember that it was such a big deal. I remember watching the news and seeing them video us when Mom and Dad and the community was picketing and us kids were out there with our signs in the road in front of the trucks. And then we go to school and the kids is like, &#8220;Well, my mom and dad says that they&#8217;re a bunch of troublemakers.&#8221; And it wasn&#8217;t a whole lot because a lot of us kids that were in Bumpus Cove all went to school together and there was a lot of us. So they weren&#8217;t going to say a whole lot to us. But you know, it was difficult at times, but at the same time, it was very enlightening, I thought, because the community there came together. They all stood together and they weren&#8217;t going to back down no matter what.   I&#8217;m pretty proud of my mom. She&#8217;s really done a lot. For someone that quit school in the fifth grade, she&#8217;s really done a lot and been through a lot and lived to tell about it. And I&#8217;m a lot like Mom. I&#8217;m the kind of person, I&#8217;m very direct and upfront and I fight for what I believe in. That&#8217;s kind of how I got in the field I&#8217;m in now and have been here because it&#8217;s something that I firmly believe in.   It wasn&#8217;t like a big, huge thing at school to the point that I was ousted, because I was very athletic. I played ball. I was in track and stuff, normal. Mom and Dad always tried to make our lives as normal as possible. After school, it was just a routine that we went to my Uncle Hobart&#8217;s house and the Bumpass Cove Citizens Center was right next to it. So we went there. We played. I watched the kids. They did their meetings and then pretty much whatever they told me to do, I did it. I went to Highlander [Research and Education] Center a lot with Mom. I remember going. We used to go down to the workshops. I loved sitting in the workshops with them and listening to all of the activists there talking about the black lung and about Yellow Creek, I think was&#8212;  JW: Yeah, Becky Simpson.   AS: Yes, the people from Yellow Creek. So there was people from different states was there meeting about all the problems in their states and stuff, and it was really interesting to hear all of these people talking and realizing that we weren&#8217;t alone, that this is happening everywhere. All the singing and dancing and stuff, they always seemed to find time to do that. I remember Mom left to go to Italy for some type of world peace conference on behalf of this and Bumpass Cove. We stayed home, but she had come back and told us about the people she met and how interesting it was and how people were very curious to learn about what all they were doing. I&#8217;m trying to think of what else. It&#8217;s been so long ago.  JW: Well, do you remember writing the school report and, I think, a poem?  AS: I wrote quite a few. I actually probably still have the poem because I have an old folder at home with all of those in it. I wrote quite a few back then and just kept them and put them away and swore that one day I would continue writing and never did. Well, I do write now, but it&#8217;s for my job. It&#8217;s not short stories or poetry. But yes, when I did write that, I was very emotional because&#8212;are you talking about the one that I mention my Uncle Hobart in?  JW: Mmm hmm.  AS: Okay. It was very hard because I saw how hard he fought, and I&#8217;ve seen how hard my family fought. I remember one night, I had spent the night with one of my cousins down in Embreeville, and I heard people talking in the middle of the night and I heard my uncle and my dad and Russell and a few of the others outside. And they didn&#8217;t know that I snuck out to peep and see what they were doing. They were supposed to have stopped taking the trucks to the landfill during this time and it was trucks going up in the middle of the night. And they were talking about what was coming out of them. And so going up the road, there was a stream of liquid, I say water, but it was liquid coming out of the back of the truck, leaking out as it was going up, and it was glowing. It was like a purplish, like a flame glowing color, but you could see it in the dark. And so they, of course, were all upset and I remember they all got in the cars and went up to the landfill. Somehow, I don&#8217;t know how or who did or what, some tacks got in the road and gave the truck a flat tire before it made it to the landfill. I don&#8217;t know how it happened. I take the fifth on that one. But I did overhear that one, too, because I was a little bit nosy. I did like to hear everybody, listen to everybody because I was curious.  My Uncle Hobart was probably one of the biggest activists, him, Dad, Mom, and them, when they started this, he was gung ho and he did it until he died, actually. He and Dad and them did go up and sneak in to do the videos to try to prove in court that they were sneaking up and still doing this and that there was toxins. He did a lot of videoing of the mountains and what all kind of damage that was done. I should have shown you in my office. I actually have a painting that my Aunt Peggy painted for Dad of the log house we lived in there in the Cove, and it shows the mountains around it and stuff. With Dad&#8217;s family, there is a lot of Indian in the Story family, and so they were very old-fashioned about a lot of things. When we were growing up, Dad, he would take us to the mountains to show us how to find wild mushrooms and now to find birch to make homemade root beer and things like that. This thing, it was their home and they were fighting tooth and nail and they were very passionate. And my Uncle Hobart was very, very passionate about it.   I had a journalism [class] in high school that had saw some of things that I had wrote and encouraged me to continue writing. So I had wrote that and gave it to my Aunt Gladys, Hobart&#8217;s wife, as a gift. That&#8217;s kind of where that came from.  JW: And this is after he died?  AS: Yes, right after he died, actually, I think.   JW: How did you see your parents change as they went through this process of getting so involved in the community and so invested in this attempt to stop this injustice?  AS: Well, especially in my mother. My mother was very uneducated. She quit school. She got married at fourteen. She had my brother when she was fifteen, me when she was seventeen, Pam when she was eighteen, Teresa when she was twenty-four. She had a fifth-grade education. So she had to cook and clean. We carried water. We raised our own chickens and pigs and things like that. So she stayed so busy with four kids and with us that that&#8217;s pretty much. Not putting Mom down by no means because she didn&#8217;t know then, but by going through this, Mom, first of all, earned her self-esteem, something that some people are born with and are taught to have their entire life. She wasn&#8217;t, and so when this all started, she met people that encouraged her to go on fighting. She met people that encouraged her to go back to school, and she got her GED. She had people that encouraged her to write. She actually wrote a paper for her GED class that got her invited, I think, as a guest speaker at the University of Virginia one time. Did she tell you that?  JW: No.  AS: Yeah, oh yeah. It didn&#8217;t have to do with Bumpus Cove, though. It had to do with overcoming ignorance and being uneducated and going through all the things that she went through and fighting to shut this landfill down and learning that she is somebody and can make a difference and did make a difference. So she wrote this thesis or this paper for her GED class. Then the next thing you know, they&#8217;re calling her and she went to Virginia, the University of Virginia, as a guest speaker for this paper. So big change for a woman that had never probably been more than ten miles or fifty miles at the most from home. She was going to Italy to this world peace talk. She was going down to Highlander Education Research Center and meeting people like Nimrod and Sissy Spacek and Guy and Candie Carawan.   And then when we would get there for these workshops, I found it so neat that all these people sat in these big, huge, wooden rocking chairs in a circle and that they were telling all their problems and their stories. I really was kind of leery how Mom would do because Mom didn&#8217;t really tell us about being a girl growing up. She grew up especially with me and my brother, Allen, because we were older. She wasn&#8217;t much older than us. So it was like she was playing with baby dolls to a point for a while, and she just didn&#8217;t have the education to know how or know how to even seek our resources until she started with all of this.   But I know that she, when we did go to Highlander and the first time that she went and spoke out, she started crying, talking about everything that we had been through. And then I started crying and the next thing you know, everybody in the entire room was crying because it hit home with everybody because everybody was there for similar reasons. But I think that was the day that Mom really started building her self-esteem up as a woman because she got to speak up for the first time and once she did that, it was just like there was no stopping. She was down there. She participated. Anything to help and to learn, she wanted to do it.   And so I think that that is probably, I know living in Bumpus Cove and the things that happened was the worst thing that could ever happen to us, but in the same sense, I think it was probably the best thing that happened for my mother. Because if she hadn&#8217;t of took the initiative to be involved and help do this, I don&#8217;t know that she wouldn&#8217;t still be that little, country, mountain woman, still living in the Cove, still living a simple life, not having an education, and not really discovering that she&#8217;s got a lot of potential to do a lot of things. There are still one or two that probably still live up there that I&#8217;m related to that are like that. So it really changed, I&#8217;m sure, it changed her life dramatically.  It taught me a lot because I loved&#8212;my sisters were younger. They didn&#8217;t really care about going to Highlander with Mom and even as adults, the last few times Mom went, I went with her because not only the people that you meet down there and the things that you learn about other places, but it makes you realize that you&#8217;re not alone when it comes to a lot of issues like that and that there is people out there that you can get resources. I used to love to go down to the Highlander library, and they would be having the workshops and I would go down to the library and sit by myself and just pick one book after another and it was like, &#8220;Oh man, this is so cool because I&#8217;ve got all this access here,&#8221; and stayed down there all day long. I just loved it.  JW: Did you meet other people your age there?  AS: Oh yeah. I was friends with Guy and Candie&#8217;s daughter. She had this tree house they made her out of doors, and it was so cool and so we used to play in that a lot. But she was there a lot. Nina, who was the cook at Highlander, she had two children and so they had become our friends and with all those fields and stuff at Highlander, we were constantly--. There was a barn with horses. So we were always finding something to play in and like I said, the people that came there from other states, even the people we met there that came from Africa for assistance and stuff, they just all seemed like such a big, loving family there. They would love play music and everybody would dance. They&#8217;d play different kinds of music, African music they would play. There was people that brought their kids to the workshops. I know there was many times when we would go for workshops that we took a tent and people would come out to be there or we stayed in the dorms if there was room and if not and there was an overflow, then we didn&#8217;t care to sleep in a tent. So it was really kind of like a mini-vacation to us. Plus, you learned so much there.   JW: So was it usually you and your mom going together?   AS: I went with her a lot when I was younger. Then I left home when I turned eighteen and I was gone for several years. When I moved back to Tennessee, I was twenty-four or twenty-five maybe. It seems like I went with her once or twice after that when she had went down to visit. They had invited us down for a celebration, and so we had went down for that. That&#8217;s pretty much been about it. I haven&#8217;t really got to go . I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s got to really go much the past several years or anything. But I loved it. I loved it.  JW: You two should go back soon.  AS: I know, I know. I would. I&#8217;d go to say. I always loved it down there. And Myles Horton, I loved him because he was a cool old man with his walking stick and so we, of course, all the kids used to follow him wherever he went. And then of course, as I got older, I learned that he was the backbone of Highlander for a long time, but he was pretty cool. And then I was at Highlander the weekend that Guy Carawan wrote the song, &#8220;Eyes are blue, cheeks are red&#8221; and he was singing it to my youngest sister, Teresa. That was pretty neat because she was little, and he liked her because she was cute and they were just so family-oriented and stuff. Then I met Seeger, Pete Seeger. Later on in life, [I] found out that he&#8217;s related to Bob Seeger, brother to Bob Seeger, the rock star.   JW: Yeah.  AS: So I was just like, &#8220;Wow.&#8221; But I remember Pete being there and singing a lot of his songs and being involved. I remember meeting him. A lot of interesting people that then, as a younger person, didn&#8217;t realize really who they were and then now that&#8217;s I&#8217;m older, I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Man, I can&#8217;t believe that they were a hell raiser like my parents. I remember them.&#8221; But yeah, I went with Mom a lot. I loved going, though. I enjoyed it and I was into, I loved school. I loved going to school. I think I went like eight years perfect attendance, didn&#8217;t want to miss school and made really good grades. So it was interesting for me because it gave me an opportunity to learn stuff that I could use at school.   My grandmother always used to say, &#8220;A wise man is the man that realizes that he always has something to learn and the dumb man is the man that thinks he&#8217;s so smart.&#8221; And so I kind of understand now the concept because I&#8217;ve always been one of those that I always feel like there&#8217;s always something more I can learn, and Mom has learned that. When we were little, I didn&#8217;t see that in her and then after all of this happened with the Bumpus Cove, she started going to Highlander, she started seeking more. She start[ed] to learn more. She started wanting to live a fuller life than taking care of kids and cleaning house. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve seen her more involved in things and going places and getting her education and getting her cojones, as I call it, to speak up and speak her mind and stuff. So I&#8217;ve seen a dramatic change, I feel, in her when all this happened.  JW: Do you remember when they started filming for the documentary, You Got to Move?  AS: Yes, and I remember when all of us kids were singing the song that was written and I couldn&#8217;t sing worth a lick. So they had me to move in the back of the group because I couldn&#8217;t carry a tune in a bucket. It kind of hurt my feelings, but I didn&#8217;t let them know that. But I do remember when they started filming it, and they had actually come to our house. There were some of the medical students from Vanderbilt stayed at our house with us. We got pretty close with them and of course, they loved Mom&#8217;s cooking. But we met a lot of people because there was so many people came, or it seemed like there was, so many students there from Vanderbilt when they were doing the health screenings. With it being communitywide, it was almost like an open, I don&#8217;t know what you call it, an open carnival-type thing because everybody is there and everybody&#8217;s here to get this done and these students were so nice. They really made everybody feel comfortable. Then they would come to our home and they were very, very polite and so appreciative of being able to sleep on our couch and my mom cook them biscuits and gravy. I do remember that. I had to share my bedroom. That was the only thing I didn&#8217;t like at first until I got to know them and then it was okay.   It was a different time and I don&#8217;t really talk about it much, but then one day I decided to Google my mom&#8217;s name and it shocked the hell out of me to see how many articles she&#8217;s in and stuff where they had did write-ups over Bumpus Cove over the years. Actually, the gentleman I share my office with, he said when he was in college, he did a thesis on Bumpus Cove.   JW: Oh really?  AS: It was so interesting and I just found that out last week. So it was so funny that he had said that. He was like, &#8220;Really? That is your mom and dad? I didn&#8217;t realize that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I met your mom and I didn&#8217;t realize that was Gail Story.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; (laughs)  JW: So how did it influence you to grow up around all of this once you became an adult and were making your own decisions about how you were going to live your own life?  AS: Well, honestly, I think by going to Highlander, well, by watching my parents fight tooth and nail and not back down taught me to do the same. I guess I&#8217;ve never really, there&#8217;s people that will fight for things, but they don&#8217;t really believe in them and they don&#8217;t have the passion for it. I think I got my passion from growing up watching my family fight then because I worked in a lot of fields and wasn&#8217;t never really content. When I worked in the legal field, I worked for some judges and lawyers for years. It was a good job, paid good money, great benefits, but I just didn&#8217;t have a passion for that, and I just felt like I wasn&#8217;t accomplishing anything. I felt like I want to be able to accomplish something. I always felt like I wanted to compare the end of my life to accomplishments that my mom and dad made, who were less educated than I am. Then I got into the banking industry for many years, and I realized that wasn&#8217;t my calling.  And then when my daughter was born and she started having a lot of her health issues growing up and more doctors that I would take her to and find out she would have more disabilities and there was this and there was that. She needed this therapist and she needed that. I realized that maybe that is my passion because I spent her entire school life fighting the education system and rights for children with disabilities and how those children are getting put on the back burner and they get shut off from other kids and they don&#8217;t get that one-on-one: &#8220;Well, you have mental retardation. You need to go in this class and play with a ball all day long.&#8221; No, it don&#8217;t work that way.   At my first IEP [Individualized Education Program] meeting with my daughter, they gave me an IEP plan, her education plan, and they gave me a packet parents&#8217; rights and responsibilities. I felt like at her IEP meeting, they had just pretty much run over me and had me in tears. They said, &#8220;Oh your daughter is too severe to be in a normal kindergarten class. She requires too much attention and she needs to go back to Asbury School for Handicapped Children.&#8221; Well, my daughter is high-functioning and enough to where I knew that was a bunch of crap. So it just insulted me, but it upset me because I hadn&#8217;t, I guess, learned to speak up yet or my voice hadn&#8217;t come yet.   So I took my packet home, and I stayed up the entire night and I memorized the parents&#8217; rights and responsibilities list in numerical order. And so I called a couple days later and set up another meeting and then I quoted them to them and I said, &#8220;I do have a right. I have a right to tell you she&#8217;s going to be in a regular school. I have a right to tell you she can be in a special ed class, but I want her mainstreamed during lunch, during physical education. I want her to have therapy.&#8221;   Most parents today with children with disabilities are uneducated and don&#8217;t know that they have a right to demand speech therapy and whatever that child may need in that aspect while they&#8217;re still in school. Most parents don&#8217;t know that if they have a child with a lot of disabilities that they can stay in school until they&#8217;re twenty-two years old.   And those are things that even though that&#8217;s outside of my job, I still do. I still talk to parents, and I got involved in a transition school to work program fair that they have every year with Washington County schools of talking to families with children with disabilities on what services there are when they get out in the community and when they get older and day programs like The Dawn of Hope and things like that. I found my passion at that time. I worked with children at one of the schools. I did one-on-one teaching for children that had autism and stuff. Then I had the opportunity to interview here, and I&#8217;ve been here going on nine years.  JW: And can you say what your current job is?  AS: Yes. My title is independent support coordinator. That&#8217;s a glorified word for case worker. I carry twenty-seven individuals on my caseload that do have mental retardation, lots of physical disabilities. Some still live home with families. Some live out in the community in what&#8217;s called supported living, which is funded by (46:31) and Medicaid Waiver. It&#8217;s agencies that are non-profit that bill the Waiver for services such as having staff in the homes to care for them and to teach them to be independent.   It&#8217;s my job if an individual, say, is having behaviors, the team meets: the agency that provides the home staff, the agency that provides their day program, their therapist, their nurses, and myself. I hold the meetings and we discuss. We do brainstorming on what therapy they may need, if they&#8217;re having a behavior, what may be causing the behavior. In some situations we found a gentleman&#8217;s having a behavior and he&#8217;s biting his hand and beating himself in the head, but it was all because he was afraid of the linoleum in his kitchen because it was squared and it had a depth perception and it scared him and he felt like he couldn&#8217;t walk across the kitchen floor. We moved his house and he stopped.   A gentleman on my caseload came from Green Valley twenty years ago, been living in the community, and for years, he had behaviors: beating people up, screaming, hollering, just really severe behaviors, until one day I saw him and he refused to wear suspenders and a belt. So he was constantly having to hold his pants and they would fall and he had to pull them back up. So I suggested, &#8220;Buy him overalls. You don&#8217;t have to worry about it. It&#8217;s his pants. It&#8217;s overalls. They&#8217;re not going to fall down. It won&#8217;t hurt.&#8221; So I went to a thrift store myself and got him a pair of overalls, put them on him, and they decided to go buy him some because that was four years ago and he&#8217;s not had a behavior since. He needed overalls. He doesn&#8217;t talk.   So it&#8217;s things like that that I really like my job. I go in their homes when they&#8217;re in supported living. I check and make sure that the agency has got a minimum of seventy-two hours worth of food, they have appropriate clothes for the seasons, there&#8217;s no bruises on them. I check their medications to make sure that no one&#8217;s taking it or it&#8217;s gotten lost and that they&#8217;re being taken care of. We work with therapists and they write plans on training the staff how to feed the people that can&#8217;t feed their self, or if they&#8217;re in the wheelchair and they require physical movement, how to transfer them.   I write a plan that&#8217;s called an &#8220;ISP.&#8221; It&#8217;s an Independent Support Plan, which is a much bigger version of an IEP from school. The plans that we write is all aspects of that person&#8217;s life from at home, day program, community, relatives, chronic medical, all their diagnoses, what treatments they&#8217;re having, what doctors they see, what medications they take, when they&#8217;re at home, what they do from the minute they get up from the minute they go to bed, what they eat, how to fix their meals. If they&#8217;re on a chopped diet, it should be one-quarter to one-half inch. It has to be very detailed. Some of the ones I&#8217;ve written has been fifty pages long. So we write those plans every year and update them as to how the person&#8217;s life has changed and how they can be taken care of. It&#8217;s our responsibility to monitor that plan that we write to ensure that the staff are following that plan that we wrote and if we find they&#8217;re not, then that&#8217;s when we report it directly to the state: &#8220;They&#8217;re not doing their job and this is what is going on.&#8221; Most of the time, I don&#8217;t call the state immediately. I usually call a meeting with the agency and with the family and say, &#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ve been in the house and she&#8217;s supposed to be doing this, this, and this, and it&#8217;s not getting done and we need to get this fixed.&#8221; So I give them thirty days or whatever and then if it&#8217;s not fixed, then I report it to the state.  I also check the homes and make sure there&#8217;s no health or safety issues and that they&#8217;ve got smoke alarms and if they&#8217;re in a wheelchair, they have a ramp. And the good thing, too, is that we used to be able to get funding for things like lifts on vans. For HIPPA reasons, I can&#8217;t give you a name, but I will say I have a young gentleman that&#8217;s in his late 20s, that has lived at home with his family for his whole life. He&#8217;s in a wheelchair, he doesn&#8217;t talk, and he is just an angel. He&#8217;s just so beautiful when you look at him with his blonde hair and blue eyes and just the way he stares at you. He had never gotten to get out in the community because we have a ninety-some-year-old grandmother and a mom that&#8217;s having to lift and take care of him while dad does the working. They couldn&#8217;t afford to go out and buy a thirty-thousand-dollar handicapped-accessible vehicle. So I worked with them on ideas of what they could do and get their current vehicle traded in for a plain, white conversion van. Then on my job, I was able to get funding through Medicaid Waiver to have a wheelchair lift installed on that van. So after twenty-eight years, this young man got to go to the mall and his mom got to take him to a park and to the Bristol Motor Speedway to see the lights and things that he never got to do before.   That was worth all the work right there, and there&#8217;s been lots of cases that I kind of became a hell raiser like my mama. There&#8217;s lots of times that we do have to fight the state for funding, and we have to do appeals and we have to prove why we need to do that. I&#8217;ve kind of learned watching my mom and dad growing up that I can do anything I want to if I believe in it strong enough and so that&#8217;s kind of how, the attitude I take now. If I firmly believe that it is something that is going make them have a good life and feel equal to me, then I&#8217;m going to fight tooth and nail until they get it somehow, even if I have to go to every agency in the country and beg for it.  JW: Well, and has your work gotten you more involved in local or state politics? Do you need to keep up more?  AS: Yes, I do. When the commissioner went out and the new commissioner came in, of course, there was lots of budget cuts and lots of changes. I have emailed and wrote letters to numerous congressmen and senators on the cuts in Medicaid Waiver funding for people with disabilities. There&#8217;s so many other areas I strongly feel that could be cut back instead of making people that can&#8217;t take care of their self pay for it. Yes, it makes me very involved in political views, especially in this field, in this area. We have had a few senators. We have a family forum every year, and we had a senator come to speak and then Mr. Ford, I can&#8217;t think of his name, he&#8217;s so funny, he came. He&#8217;s a congressman, I think. But anyway, they had actually come to our family forum. I&#8217;ve met quite a few interesting people in this field, too. I went to the Mega conference and I met a lot of people there and a lot of talented people, people with disabilities with a lot of talent that are activists in this area.  JW: Well, and another aspect of our project is documenting the women&#8217;s movement and so I wonder if as you were growing up as a teenager in the [19]80s, going to places like Highlander, seeing your mom be active, if you ever thought about the women&#8217;s movement or gender equality or if that was ever something that was around you or that you became aware of?  AS: Oh yes. I got in a big, heated gender battle in high school because I wrote a poem called, &#8220;Equal Rights.&#8221;  JW: Really?
AS: Yes. It was talking about in the 1800s how the parts were divided and men went to work, women stayed home and had babies, I can&#8217;t remember it all, and how a man felt like he was the man and the woman was to stay home and be uneducated. Then it says, I think the last verse said something about, &#8220;But in these times, things are fair.&#8221; And it talks about equal pay and being treated with more respect. I can&#8217;t remember. I&#8217;ve still got a copy of it somewhere. But I had written this for a journalism class in high school. We had to read it out loud and I had every boy in the room mad at me because I said we were equal and they didn&#8217;t like. This was in the early 80s.  [Are you needing to lock up and leave? Okay.]  So it kind of started a little ruckus at the school because I had wrote this poem about&#8212;I know, I&#8217;m always a troublemaker. So I had wrote this poem about the equal rights and women&#8217;s rights and how women are treated more fairly than they used to be and that we weren&#8217;t just supposed to be barefoot and pregnant, that we did have a voice to speak out. I learned that when Mom started going to Highlander because that was the first time I&#8217;d ever seen a woman speak out and it wasn&#8217;t Mom speaking out. It was the other women, Candie Carawan, it was these women there talking about all of these things that&#8217;s happened and what they&#8217;ve done and the education that they had received. And a lot of them had college degrees or masters degrees and they had been through all the things to learn and to have what they wanted. So that just kind of, I guess, helped me grow my cojones to speak up and I&#8217;ve kind of been that way ever since. (laughs)  But yeah, I had wrote a poem, matter of fact, about at the same time I wrote the one that you had seen. It was published in the school paper and then that&#8217;s kind of when everybody, &#8220;Well, who do you think you are?&#8221; But it was called, &#8220;Women&#8217;s Rights.&#8221;  JW: What about the other girls in school? How did they feel about it?  AS: Well, you know, the girls liked it. Of course, they just thought that was so cool that I wrote something like that. You don&#8217;t think about it at the time. I just knew that that was my opinion, and I&#8217;m still kind of like that. Even when I write these plans, I write it the way that I think it should be. Now if it&#8217;s wrong, I respect anyone&#8217;s opinion, but it kind of has made me that way my entire life after that, I think. I honestly don&#8217;t think that I would have been such a forward fighter if I hadn&#8217;t of went with Mom to Highlander and if I hadn&#8217;t of, because I was very quiet until then and Mom was. Mom didn&#8217;t know how to have a voice until all of that started happening, and so it taught me that it doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;m a girl or a boy or if I&#8217;m rich or poor. I have a voice, and I&#8217;m going to voice my opinion and I have a right to say and if someone I voted for in office isn&#8217;t doing their job, I have every right to email them and say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel you&#8217;re doing your job and I helped put you there.&#8221;   So yeah, I think it really helped me to have a voice and speak up because some of the workshops we went to, there was a lot of women there during the rights movement and there was people still about civil rights. I probably got more education, I&#8217;ll be quite honest with you, going to Highlander and just attending those workshops and listening to those people than I could have gotten in a lifetime of school because things there, you could read about things in school all day long, but when you&#8217;re living it and you're watching it and you are watching people, like the people from Africa was talking about what all was going on with them and the wars and how their families were killed or how they were beaten or treated or whatever&#8212;
