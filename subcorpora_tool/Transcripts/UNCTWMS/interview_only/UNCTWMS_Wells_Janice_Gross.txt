LIZ LUNDEEN:  This is Liz Lundeen of the Southern Oral History Program and today is August 10th, 2012. I&#8217;m here with Janice Wells in her home in Chapel Hill, NC.  So we&#8217;re just going to get started by talking a little bit about your early life, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about where you grew up and say something about your parents or your siblings?  JANICE WELLS:  Well, my parents were originally from Catawba County [North Carolina].  My dad actually joined the Air Force because there were very few opportunities for him in Catawba County.  If you didn&#8217;t work in the cotton mills or the weaving mills, then there weren&#8217;t a lot of opportunities.  My mother got a $200 scholarship to college, but she had no, there was nobody in her background who had gone to college.  So she didn&#8217;t go to college because $200 wasn&#8217;t enough to pay for everything.  So they married at age 19.  She was 19.  My dad was 21.  And they moved to Arizona.  He was a career Air Force person.  So I grew up all over, but I was born in Tucson, Arizona, left there when I was only one year old.  My mother ended up having four children in five years.  I&#8217;m the oldest.  And we lived in Nebraska, Kansas, North Carolina for a brief period, Texas and South Carolina.  So that&#8217;s generally where I grew up.  [We] ended up back in North Carolina.  So I graduated in North Carolina.  I always was excited about moving to a new place, and for me it was sort of an adventure to move every two years or so.  But for my siblings, especially for my brothers, it was much more difficult because boys usually get involved in athletics.  But also I was very different from my siblings because they loved being outside and climbing trees and building tree houses, and I loved reading and staying at home and was very unathletic, and so I usually got disciplined for reading books under the covers at night.  We were very different growing up.  As far as where I went to school, I started to school in Texas in the first grade.  And then second grade I was in Catawba County because my dad was sent over to Korea, and so we came back home.  My mother came back home with the four of us.  So I attended the second grade here, third grade in Kansas, fourth through the tenth grade in Greer, South Carolina, when my dad came back and was stationed at Donaldson Air Force Base, which has since been closed.  And then after my tenth grade year we moved to Goldsboro, North Carolina where he was stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. And then from there to WC&#8212;  LL:  Right, right.  JW:  What was WC then, Woman&#8217;s College [in Greensboro] and then to Chapel Hill.  So that&#8217;s a little bit.  LL:  Yeah, that&#8217;s really great.  I was wondering if you could maybe say a little bit about, we were talking just before the tape went on about where you parents were from&#8212;a rural part of Catawba County, right?     JW:  Right, my parents were from the rural part of Catawba County.  They grew up on subsistence, what I called subsistence farms.  There was an area where farmers had about thirty-five to seventy acres apiece.  There were about ten of them in my parents&#8217; community.  One of the farmers was African American.  Because they had such small farms and only raised enough to feed their families, and all of them had eight to ten children, they formed a co-op and helped each other plant their fields and then they did their harvesting.  They shared harvesting, and I shared with you how they also during Prohibition had their own moonshine still just for the ten farmers.  What was I think interesting as an adult, as I look back on some of the stories my parents told, is that the African American [farmer].  This was a very community-oriented effort, and the African Americans were treated the same as everybody else until the children got to be teenagers.  And at that point all of the kids sort of stopped socializing with one another.  It wasn&#8217;t &#8211;  They just sort of drifted apart at teenage years.  But before then the African American children and the white children all played together in the pastures.  The white church, the African Americans would come to the white church for revivals, but they would have to sit on the outside.  And then when the African American church had a revival, the white people went to their church, but they had to sit on the outside to listen.  LL:  Uh-huh, yeah.  JW:  So it was very, it was a difference experience [for] my parents than I think a lot of people being raised in the rural South in the 1920s and [19]30s.    LL:  And the way they kind of communicated these stories to you, did you get a sense that they were trying to impart lessons about race relations to you when you were young and growing up?  JW:  Yeah, I think so because we were taught growing up several things.  One is that if we wanted to incur the wrath of our parents &#8211; If we made fun of someone, that was totally not tolerated.  Whether it was somebody different because of skin color or disability or social class or lack of money or whatever.  Those kinds of things we were punished for.  We were taught by our parents to respect everybody regardless of what their station or circumstance was.  And our parents lived that way as they moved around to these different places geographically people were very different.  And our lives intersected with people from other cultures, and our parents always treated everybody the same.  And so they had not, they didn&#8217;t have high tolerance for us when we were showing attitudes or behaviors that were not consistent with that.    LL:  Just to go back to when you said you were moving around.  You spent your high school years, part of them in Greer?  JW:  Greer, South Carolina.  LL:  And then part of them in Goldsboro.  JW:  And part of them in Goldsboro.  LL:  So this is after the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education] decision comes down, right?  JW:  Yeah, when I was in Goldsboro High School, in the eleventh grade, which would&#8217;ve been 1961, we had &#8211; I guess it was either 1961 or 1962 when the first African Americans started to school in Goldsboro High School.  LL:  And what was that like?  Do you have any memories or &#8211;?  JW:  What was it like?  People talked about not associating with that person.  So there was sort of like, that person [was] sort of an island that was sort of cut off from everybody else.  My feelings at the time were how awful that was.  And what courage that person had to have to come into that kind of hostile environment and be a part of a movement that was very significant.  But I felt like both that person and their family had to be very courageous in doing that.  LL:  Was it understood in your family that you would go to college?  Were you always college-bound or was this a decision that you had to make yourself?  JW:  I&#8217;m actually the only college graduate in my family.  I always knew, and I don&#8217;t know whether it was because of teachers or whatever, but I always knew I would go to college.  My parents listened to me.  They didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;No we don&#8217;t have the money,&#8221; or anything like that.  They were always supportive of that decision even though they didn&#8217;t know how that would happen.  Because we didn&#8217;t really have a tradition of college in my family, and if you don&#8217;t have a tradition of college and if you are moving around every two years and don&#8217;t have a significant person that&#8217;s going to be emotionally supportive of that decision, it&#8217;s pretty miraculous.  My sister and I were together at the beginning of this week, and we were talking about this very thing.  And I said, I always knew that I was going to go, and so when I graduated from Goldsboro High School, I had a $200 scholarship and that was it.  LL:  Same amount that your mom had been offered, yeah.  JW:  Same amount my mom had been offered, except for during her period of that time that would&#8217;ve probably paid for a year.  So I went off to college.  My dad had applied for an Air Force Aid Scholarship for me.  But we hadn&#8217;t heard anything.  So when I went off to college, all I knew this first $200 was enough to pay for my first six weeks.  And that&#8217;s it.  But my mom and dad, they didn&#8217;t say, &#8220;What a crazy idea you have.&#8221;  They just said, &#8220;You understand when you go there, we take you there, but we may have to pick you up in six weeks.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Yeah, I understand that.&#8221;  They were saying, my dad was saying, &#8220;Well, maybe you should wait until next year to see whether or not you actually get this other thing.&#8221;  I said, you know I just felt convicted, or convinced that I should go ahead and go.  And I did.  And the scholarship did come through.  And so it worked out.  LL:  You were able to stay.  JW:  Yeah.  LL:  And can you say a little bit, one quick question back to your family  Were there different expectations for you and your sister versus your brothers&#8212;  JW:  Of course.  LL:  In terms of what you would do?  JW:  My brothers and sisters, my sister and I always felt like our brothers always had it easier than we did because we helped with the cooking and just the household chores that you have to do.  And it seemed like our brothers didn&#8217;t do any of that, and then when we got older, it seemed we also cut the grass and did the other things.  And it was like, &#8220;What are these boys doing?  They don&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;  So we felt like we had the brunt of it, but if you talked to them they probably felt something else.  My younger brother had a paper route, so he had other things that he did.  L:  And when you went to UNCG, what was, the first year maybe Woman&#8217;s College, I don&#8217;t remember&#8212;it changed in [19]62 or [19]63.  JW:  It had changed&#8212;yeah, it had changed.  I went there in [19]63.  It had just changed over to UNCG.  So I think the first year that I was there&#8212;  LL:  It was still all women, right?  JW:  Primarily women at the undergraduate level.  But UNCG always had men for the graduate programs, and so yeah, it was primarily women.  We had curfews.  We lived on campus.  We had a few African American students, and I was in some of the honors classes with those students and got to know them that way.  I was a sociology major, and so I had some fabulous woman teachers&#8212;one woman who had been one of the first female attorneys and judges in Louisiana.  A woman who had been a missionary in China and just wonderful, wonderful women instructors who communicated to us that they realized that a lot of women who were there would be women who would be married and take on traditional roles.  But that whether you took on a traditional role as a wife or mother or had a career, you had a responsibility to the community because you were an educated woman.  You had a responsibility to make your community better.  I agreed with that philosophy.  So a lot of people had the opportunity to transfer to Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill] at the end of their sophomore year.  I didn&#8217;t do that.  I really didn&#8217;t have any desire to transfer to Carolina.  I wanted to stay where I was.    LL: Can you say a little bit about why; what [about] being at Woman&#8217;s College made you want to stay?  JW:  Well, they had phenomenal instructors and phenomenal women, I think. Phenomenal female instructors who were not only excellent teachers but who opened up new worlds sort of to you.  And for me who came from a very poor family, because at the time my dad was in the Air Force, we had very little money.  There&#8217;s a big difference now between what people in the military live on, which is a very good salary, especially if you don&#8217;t have a college degree, and what my father lived on.  And not until some of the military people started applying for food stamps in the late [19]60s and [19]70s did the government become ashamed of how poorly treated some of these people were.  So trying to live on $200 a month for a family of six when I was young was very challenging.  So I don&#8217;t know how I got on that.  LL:  Just talking about, I think you were saying that some of your mentors and your teachers&#8212;  JW:  Oh yeah and so because we had come from a very poor background &#8211; although my family had, wherever we moved you just enjoyed whatever place that you were at.  You explored the state parks; you got to know the area.  Our parents tried to teach us that every place had richness to it.  So even though I didn&#8217;t get to go to things like concerts and have music lessons and do all that other stuff, there was that heritage of just enjoying the richness of whatever was around you.  But in college we were required to go to these cultural events.  So those all opened up to me a different world.  The professors opened up a different world.  And it was just a matter of, &#8220;nothing was impossible.&#8221;  I guess that&#8217;s what was communicated to us.  I think that for me being in a women&#8217;s environment was a comfortable place to learn.  And I wasn&#8217;t so focused on getting married.  That&#8217;s not to say, I&#8217;m sure a lot of the women who transferred weren&#8217;t focused on getting married either, but that really was not my focus.  I enjoyed learning.  I enjoyed being there.  It was an exciting and comfortable place for me.  LL:  Were you exposed to activism, to social justice movements that were going on at the time?  JW:  In Greensboro.  Actually we were, I did some tutoring in the housing project, and that was stopped when they started having some of the riots and things like that because it wasn&#8217;t considered safe for us to be there.  So that&#8217;s the only exposure I had at the time.  LL:  Did you have a sense of sort of, before you got there&#8212;the sit-ins had happened before you got there.  Did you have a sense of that legacy or was it kind of just&#8212;  JW:  No, it was just, no.  No.    LL:  Yeah.  JW:  Now Goldsboro had some issues around social activism because [of] the civil rights movement.  I remember the church I was going to at the time was sort of racist to tell you the truth, which surprised me when it happened. The ministers were told that African Americans might come into our churches and to reserve the front pews for them and not to be hostile to them.  But anyway, I had a private conversation with my pastor about that, which was very disturbing to me because I, from biblical passages I didn&#8217;t see &#8211; biblical passages to me demanded behavior that was so much different than that.  I couldn&#8217;t put how my church could be that racist and then also purport&#8212;  LL:  Yeah, &#8220;the Bible said&#8230;&#8221;  JW:  Purport to do the Bible.  So anyway I had a conversation with my pastor, which did not go well.  So I didn&#8217;t see myself as an activist; it was just that&#8212;  LL:  It didn&#8217;t make sense.  JW:  This was not right and it doesn&#8217;t make sense.  It wasn&#8217;t consistent with what I knew, and so it didn&#8217;t make sense with the way my parents treated their friends in the service.  There were a lot of different cultures.  So we had had people from a lot of different colors in our house and backgrounds.  So it just didn&#8217;t make sense to me.  So during college I sort of dropped out of church.    LL:  Mm, yeah.  JW:  So that&#8217;s the sort of the brushes with activism that I had.  LL:  And then how did you decide that you wanted to go pursue a master&#8217;s in social work.    JW:  I&#8217;ve told my daughter that if it had been ten years later, I probably would&#8217;ve gone into medicine or city planning or something other than social work.  But the way I chose social work is that I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do.  So I went over to the career services office, and I took all of these tests, and it told me some of the things that I would be well-fitted for, and actually I think medicine was one of those, but for women, there weren&#8217;t that many women being accepted in medical school then.  And I had instructors who were strong social workers.  And so I think they influenced me, and I know one of them wanted me to go to Columbia or to Chicago, and I just couldn&#8217;t see myself being plopped down in the middle&#8212;this little country girl&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t really see myself being plopped down in these big cities in the 1960s, late 1960s.  I didn&#8217;t see how I could survive that or have the money to do that.  So I ended up in Chapel Hill instead.  LL:  This was [19]67?  JW:  [19]67.    LL:  Okay.  Great.  Can you talk a little bit about what kind of the curriculum was like?  I&#8217;m sure you had placements or internships.  JW:  Well, before I went to, I graduated early.  So I graduated in January, and I worked for the North Carolina Fund&#8212;  LL:  Oh fantastic.  JW:  Which was a Ford Foundation project.  North Carolina was one of the states, it was sort of like a research state for the Ford Foundation.  So during that period of time before school started, between January 1st and September, I traveled all over the state, and we worked in various communities where they were doing community action programs.  But when I started to school, I had an NIH, National Institute of Mental Health, I had a mental health grant.  So my first placement was at in Mecklenburg County Department of Social Services, and I was placed in the Child Welfare unit.  That was also a time when they were having a lot of, I guess, unrest in Charlotte.  And we had to drive county cars when we did our work with families.  And so when they started having a lot of unrest, we had to pull back in and not make home visits.  I think it was just the student interns at that point that weren&#8217;t allowed to make those home visits because it was considered too dangerous in the inner city of Charlotte.  I never felt unsafe myself.  So that was my first field placement.    And then during the second year I worked at the state economic opportunity office, which was policy planning and traveled across the state.  But it was during both years at Carolina, probably the second year at Carolina because we had what you call a block placement.  The first year we were in classes in the first semester.  Second semester we were in Charlotte the whole semester.  LL:  It was all of you or just that was your particular&#8212;  JW:  All of us, first year&#8212;  LL:  Oh wow.  Okay.  JW:  So it wasn&#8217;t what we called a concurrent thing where you&#8217;re in class and internship.  But the second year I had a concurrent placement so I was in class and also had the placement in Raleigh.  We were very involved with, that&#8217;s when I became involved with the local civil rights movement, attended some SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] meetings, but really didn&#8217;t&#8212;I mean, that was not my thing.  My thing was civil rights and the Vietnam War.  So we were very involved in that.  And it&#8217;s probably some of the most, you know you just know that something is right.  And so you just get involved with it.  You just protest or well, to me it&#8217;s just standing up for it.  It&#8217;s not really protesting.  It&#8217;s like, I like to think of it in a positive way.  It&#8217;s not protesting something bad.  It&#8217;s being for something that&#8217;s right and good.  So I think that for me when you think of that in that more positive way that you, it sets a&#8212;[door knocking]&#8212;it sets up a&#8212;you want to stop for a minute while he comes in.  LL:  Sure.    [Pause in recording]    LL: This is Liz Lundeen.  We&#8217;re back after a short break, interviewing Jan Wells, and we&#8217;re going to return to talking about the civil rights movement and her involvement in it.    JW:  So I got involved in it mainly I think from [19]68 to [19]70.  We were heavily involved in both the civil rights movement &#8211; then there was the Poor People&#8217;s March in Washington taking place at that time and the Vietnam War protests.  And one of the more memorable events that I participated in, we were at Northgate shopping center in Durham carrying our signs protesting because they would not hire African American to work for them, or if they did hire African Americans, they wouldn&#8217;t let them work in management positions.  And so we were just walking on the sidewalk one evening when a pickup truck pulled in front of us up onto the sidewalk and the man, there were two men in the truck, and they had shotguns pointing at us.  So we were thinking, &#8220;Well this may be the end of us.&#8221;  But just about the time that we were, it happened so quickly, and it took us so much by surprise.  And just about that time one of our African American friends that we had been working with pulled up beside that truck, and he had a pistol, which scared us even more, and pointed it at the guy with the shotgun and said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I were you.&#8221;  So there was this macho standoff between those two just with gazes back and forth and then the pickup truck, the guy who drove the pickup truck drove off.  But we were, the person that I was protesting with at that time happened to be my husband now.  So we shared common interests and, but that was very scary.  But it wasn&#8217;t scary enough for us to stop protesting either.    A lot of the marches and the protests sort of dwindled after a while over a period of years, and there were court decisions and things like that that changed and, but it takes much more than court decisions and policy changes to change people&#8217;s attitudes and to help people truly integrate into society.  And so after we moved &#8211;.  We moved from Raleigh, we got married in 1969, January of 1969 before I finished my master&#8217;s degree in social work.  And my husband finished his degree in education, and we ended up thinking we were going to go to the Peace Corps and ended up not going to the Peace Corps and ended up in New Bern, North Carolina for our first year of marriage.  And my husband got a job with the educational system there on the base at Cherry Point.  And when he showed up in his wire-rimmed glasses for his interview, that concerned some people, and so they transferred him to a school that integrated its faculty, but the student body was African American.  It was Newbold High School outside in Craven County.    And so that school had very few people who went on to college, and my husband really encouraged some people to go onto college from there.  At the time the farmers would come up, and the principal would make an announcement, whoever wants to go and work in tobacco for Farmer John get on the truck and they would get on the truck and leave for the day and bring these kids back in time to take the bus home at night or in the afternoon.  So but my husband would take some of the kids to North Carolina Central and other places to help them to begin to think about the possibility that they could go to college.  And other things that he did in Craven County is that that school had no running water, no paper towels, and then they did have running water, cold water, but it was just the sanitation conditions there were horrible.  So he went to the school board. He went to the public health department and got the demographics of where the highest incidences of some infectious and communicable diseases were, and of course right there around that school system, you had some very high incidences of communicable diseases.  He went to the school board and asked them to at least make sure they had running water, toilet paper, paper towels, so that kids could wash their hands.  And they weren&#8217;t very happy about that, and so we threatened other things.  He took them the data from the public health department and they did, within a month or so, make sure they had running hot water, and so that was something good that happened there and for him.  So he continued, and he&#8217;s continued throughout his life as I have trying to create better conditions for people who are being disenfranchised in one way or the other.    He was one of the first people in his organization to hire an African American.  When we were living at Syracuse, New York at that time, he was one of the first people in his organization to hire women.  And likewise I've done similar things, serving on boards and you say, well, it&#8217;s very simple to be an advocate in an unobtrusive way.  You can say, &#8220;Well, I look around the room and I see we&#8217;re making policies for this group of people and there&#8217;s nobody here&#8212;&#8221;  LL:  No representative.  JW:  No representative.  &#8220;Is there a way that we can have somebody who can come and speak for themselves?&#8221;  Trying to get people involved on boards and commissions that have an impact on programs that affect who they are as a group. I got a Ph.D. later when I was forty-two &#8211; let&#8217;s see I guess I was forty-seven when I got a Ph.D.  And encouraging students, opening up opportunities to students who had never been out of the states that they [grew up in]. I taught at the University of Alabama and Winthrop University in South Carolina and then at [North Carolina] State [University].  In many of those rural universities, a lot of kids who come to school there have never been out of the state, and just getting them to think about opportunities and possibilities and seeing, helping them to see that they can find a way to do a study abroad, for instance.  If you can get a poor, rural, African American student to study abroad, it changes their whole life.  And so trying to be supportive and inclusive and getting other organizations that we&#8217;re a part of to do the same, not in a hostile way but in a positive way, because we have confidence that when those people, when different people&#8217;s voices are heard, that experience gives the other people on the boards and commissions a different experience with them that challenges their attitudes, which are often based on what somebody else says or somebody else&#8217;s experience.  It&#8217;s not based in reality.  So if you can open up those experiences for them in some way, it has a very positive impact.  Again it&#8217;s not loud and it&#8217;s not like when we were carrying placards, but in some ways it&#8217;s more effective.  LL:  When you were carrying those placards, were there particular organizations that you were involved with like SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?  JW:  Well, all of those organizations were, came together&#8212;  LL:  Coalitions.  JW:  But it was a coalition and some of the people that we worked with from those organizations were certainly together, but we were there mostly as a student group at Carolina to begin with. They were the organizers but we were their bodies.  I guess really that&#8217;s what it boiled down to.  They were the organizers and we were there bodies.  We never joined SDS.  We never joined SNCC.  We never joined NAACP, but we worked with all those people.  LL:  I've been wondering if you remember who the lead organizers were? Were there lots of women in leadership positions or were there people voicing discontent about that?  JW:  Mainly men.  LL:  Did that make people upset?  I mean do you remember thinking&#8212;  JW:  You know I don&#8217;t remember the women&#8217;s issues at the forefront at that time.  I think that there were mainly, the people that we worked with were almost all men.  Women were involved as bodies, but men were the ones who took on most of the leadership roles, and the &#8211; I should say men were the visible leaders.  I think about The Help, the film The Help, and certainly women were participating in a different sort of way.  But the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War were so prevalent in the consciousness of our country at that time that that was the focus.  Which is consistent because African American males certainly got the vote long before women got the vote.  So it sort of makes sense that African American issues and war issues took precedence before the women&#8217;s movement.  Now even at UNC-G we were very much aware of the beginning of the women&#8217;s movement, but it was sort of overshadowed here I think in the South at that time.  LL:  When do you think that changed?  When do you think sort of the women&#8217;s movement came to the fore?  JW:  Hmm, I think probably well, I think the men were back home.  Well, Simone [de] Beauvoir I think&#8212;  LL:  Simone de Beauvoir.  JW:  Yeah, certainly you had women who were beginning to write in the late [19]50s and in the [19]60s and then overshadowed and then came back into focus again in the [19]70s.  After it was like the civil rights things had been settled to a degree.  I mean they are always going to be with us, but settled to a degree, and now let&#8217;s focus on other area of inequality.  And so you had more women writers.  You had the pill.  LL:  Legalized.  JW:  I think that really the invention of the birth control pill, I felt like that was the one thing that had the most significant impact on the women&#8217;s movement because women were no longer tied to children.  LL:  Absolutely.  JW:  And so that gave them, that gave them the ability to control their child bearing in a way and to have careers. So that they wouldn&#8217;t be in and out of the workforce.  They weren&#8217;t so financially dependent on men.  You began to have research that came out comparing men and women.  I&#8217;ll never forget reading this one about this group of&#8212;and I don&#8217;t even know when it was&#8212;it was probably in the [19]70s or [19]80s when I read it where they looked at salaries between men and women who graduated from Wharton College.  There was at least $10,000 a year difference in their salaries, but what was interesting to me about that study was that the men felt like they were being underpaid, and the women felt like they were being adequately&#8212;    LL:  Compensated.  JW:  Compensated.  So women didn&#8217;t really have a consciousness of being adequately compensated for the work they do.  So as more and more research began to come to the forefront, I think women became more and more aware and began to speak up for themselves.  LL:  And did you feel a part of the women&#8217;s movement, of the women&#8217;s movement of the [19]70s?  JW:  Well, I've always been accused by a lot of my friends of being a feminist, but my daughters tell me, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re not a feminist.  You&#8217;re a womanist.&#8221;  And so I don&#8217;t know if you know the difference between those two terms, but a feminist is more of a radical term and I've never seen myself as a radical.  I've seen myself as a centrist and a womanist appreciates who women are and how they&#8217;ve been made biologically and their differences.  We don&#8217;t hate men; we love men.  It&#8217;s just that we want equal rights.  So we&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m not a&#8212; I think in the early parts of the women&#8217;s movement, women involved in the movement were considered man haters.  And I've never been in that camp.  I've been in the camp that here we are and what phenomenal abilities we have and we can do anything that men can do and we want to be paid equally.  And we&#8217;re still not.  Here we are in 2012 and still we&#8217;ve made some advances, but women are still being paid less.  I mean even with women taking over as chief executives of major corporations &#8211; I think there&#8217;s a women now in head of Hewlett-Packard.  In spite of all of that, here we are.  I know at Winthrop we were doing a study of salaries and there was compression, salary compression because people who were hired many years ago were getting a lot less pay than new professors, assistant professors coming in.  As I was working on that study with somebody I said, &#8220;You know I think we need to go a step further.  We have an issue of salary compression here.&#8221; But as I was looking at some of the data, [I said], &#8220;There are issues around; there are male-female issues here.  There are gender issues also.&#8221;  So one year [we] addressed the compression issues just due to the time when people were hired, and then they said, &#8220;Okay, we will do that. We will do another study on gender issues.&#8221;  And the next year a lot of the women got at least a $3,000 raise who had been there because there was that much inequity.  There was that much inequity.    So it&#8217;s always just being aware; it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s sort of in your brain.  If you are, if you are an activist&#8212;.  But it&#8217;s not really an activist.  If it is just a part of who you are as a person, that you want justice for people, you look for and you don&#8217;t consciously go in looking for, but when you see things like, &#8220;Well, yeah, there are inequity here in regards to when people were hired, but look.  There&#8217;s also this.&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t go in looking for, we didn&#8217;t go looking for gender inequities.  But you have to be somebody who pays attention to that.   It has to be on your radar screen all the time, and I&#8217;m not conscious of that.  It&#8217;s just when you look retrospectively, it&#8217;s there.  It&#8217;s always there.    And you know my parents lived that. I think that all of us have a responsibility for teaching young children to treat others with respect.  I think it boils down to that.  It&#8217;s not just social justice; it&#8217;s a respect for human beings.  And you have to, you have to do something about it when it&#8217;s not just.  You just have to.  LL:  It sounds like the various causes that you were an advocate for were all sort of related under respect and dignity&#8212;  JW:  Respect and dignity, yeah, justice.  LL:  So I&#8217;m wondering if we can go back, I was so intrigued to hear you say that you had worked for the North Carolina Fund after you graduated.  I&#8217;m wondering if you can say a little bit more about that experience and reflect maybe on how that might have influenced you.  JW:  Well, the North Carolina Fund, I think my family actually influenced me more than what I did.  But I probably chose places to work that were also consistent with my personal values.  So I was research assistant, and the North Carolina Fund was one of numerous projects that focused on poverty.  And North Carolina had a statewide project.  So I had an opportunity to play with data that and work with people, with Lumbee Indians for instance and with African Americans and with people from the mountains of North Carolina, all who were disenfranchised groups and were very poor and had limited resources and limited access to things. And just playing with the data, gathering the data and looking at the data and understanding that all parents have the same desires for their children.  They all want them to be well educated, no matter whether you&#8217;re a mother on welfare or you somebody who&#8217;s very wealthy.  You have some of the same desires for healthy children and for education and for opportunities.  So we&#8217;re all the same in some ways.  Don&#8217;t have the same access and that can certainly come out to very different outcomes for people.  LL:  Are there any other jobs that you had as a social worker in your many moves across the country that stand out?  JW:  Yeah, when I was in Chicago, I worked with a research project that dealt with children, seriously mentally ill children and adolescents.  These were kids who were homicidal or suicidal.  They were not kids who were having problems with their friends.  This was much more than that.  The focus of the research project was to prove that children could stay in their community with the right array of services without being hospitalized.  Chicago at the time had the most psychiatric beds for children and adolescents per population of any place in the country.  They had numerous psychiatric beds.  So the project that I worked with brought together seventy public and private providers, and of course money was one of the reasons this project was funded because a lot of Medicaid dollars were being used for hospitalization for these seriously mentally ill children and adolescents.  The average for this very intense population, the average hospital stay was eleven days per year.  And within a two-year period of time with the efforts of these private and public entities, we brought that down to two days per population.  But more than that it was just healthier for the kids because if you can treat children in the community, so that they aren&#8217;t labeled as mentally ill, then they think differently about themselves and the community thinks differently about them.  I&#8217;ll never forget this one foster mother who said to us one time&#8212;she was a foster mother for children who had serious mental illness.  She said, &#8220;My two boys can act up in school.&#8221; [They were] grammar school kids.  She said, &#8220;They&#8217;re immediately sent to the office and I&#8217;m called and have to take them to the psychiatrist for some kind of evaluation.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Your two kids can act up, do the same behavior and because they don&#8217;t have a label on them, they&#8217;re just &#8216;being boys.&#8217;&#8221;    I think the most difficult thing to do in terms of advocacy is to change public agencies&#8217; way of dealing with problems, social problems.  Here we had the juvenile justice system and the Department of Social Services saying, &#8220;Oh we can&#8217;t provide services for these kids in their home because we&#8217;re responsible; we have custody and what if something goes wrong.&#8221;  We said, &#8220;The research shows you if you can put a respite care worker with this kid for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, the crisis is going to pass and they can stay where they are.  They&#8217;re not treated like they&#8217;re mentally ill and can&#8217;t cope.  They just have some pretty severe challenges, but you&#8217;ve got to change.&#8221;  The research project did have the funds to provide that level of community support, but it wasn&#8217;t community support for the life of the child; it&#8217;s [for] when the child was in crisis.  The other part of that was beginning to build relationships for these children in the community that could sustain them &#8211; getting an employer, for instance, when a kid was a teenager, to take a chance.  &#8220;Say, why don&#8217;t you bring them in and let them work with you for awhile and begin to develop some social skills and some job skills and life skills when the kids were young.&#8221;  But getting employers to sign on and say, &#8220;Oh okay.  I&#8217;ll cut them some slack and I&#8217;ll do this.&#8221;  And getting the DSS [Department of Social Services] to say, &#8220;Okay, they can stay at home with the wrap-around service instead of going to the hospital.&#8221; That was a big advocacy project.  The most difficult thing for me was not change&#8212;we could change the public&#8217;s attitude.  It was changing the agencies, the bureaucracy who said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it this way.&#8221;  I've always chosen things that were a little bit cutting edge like that.  It&#8217;s more exciting.  So now here we are, thirty years later, instituting some of these things that research has&#8212;  LL:  Shown for a long time.  JW:  &#8212;shown [for] thirty and forty years that it&#8217;s the better approach.  It costs less, and it&#8217;s better for the kids and that population group.  So it&#8217;s a crazy society to live in.  LL:  You mentioned in the notes you sent me beforehand that domestic violence was also something that you had been involved in.  JW:  Yeah, not directly but just teaching in the classroom.  We see our students who are domestic violence victims.  As a hospital social worker I saw domestic violence victims all the time and working with women and helping them&#8212;not in a domestic violence program, per se but screening for domestic violence long before we were taught to do that, long before emergency rooms starting screening for domestic violence. And most of them do that now.  But it&#8217;s more than identifying that as a problem.  I think you have to teach young women early, &#8220;Here are the signs and it&#8217;s easy to get caught up.&#8221;  For some women, for whatever reason, it&#8217;s easy to get trapped in these relationships. You have to teach young women, I would say in junior high school, high school, here are the signs.  Don&#8217;t get involved beyond this.  And along with that you have to offer some kind of alternatives for these young women.  You have to give them the skills they need to avoid those kinds of relationships in the first place, and if they&#8217;re in them to get out of them early if possible. I think the research shows that women will be battered pretty severely seven or eight times before they will leave that partner if they leave.  And of course often what we see is this murder-suicide thing that occurs.    But we&#8217;ve gone through a whole period of time where we&#8217;ve had to advocate for changes in the legal system.  Domestic violence was considered in some states, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware of domestic violence statutes, and it&#8217;s considered a misdemeanor. It was considered a misdemeanor, and then we started saying, &#8220;Why is it when a man, a person, beats their spouse here it&#8217;s a misdemeanor.  But if he beat one of his friends at a bar, it&#8217;s assault.&#8221;  So speaking out to get laws changed and to get people to think differently about how they prosecute cases. Some places if the woman drops the charges, then the legal system doesn&#8217;t pursue then.  Now in many places it doesn&#8217;t make any difference what the woman does.  If they&#8217;re assaulted, then the person doing the assaulting will be prosecuted no matter&#8212;I mean she doesn&#8217;t have a say so of whether or not that person&#8217;s going to be prosecuted.  So the onus is not on her, it&#8217;s on the legal system.  Our best chance always is prevention; it&#8217;s always educating young girls.    LL:  And boys too.  JW:  And boys too.  You get bullying a lot of times with boys.  But in the junior high, it&#8217;s got to be done in junior high and high school.  It&#8217;s just got to be.  It&#8217;s much easier to do it then.    LL:  So you have two daughters.  JW:  I have two daughters.  LL:  I&#8217;m just curious in terms of raising them&#8212; You and your husband were educators, right?  JW:  Well, he started off&#8212;  LL:  In education.  JW:  In education.  He taught one year and then we lived in New Bern one year. And then my state economic opportunity office, where I had done my internship at Shaw University&#8212; they had gotten a HUD [Housing and Urban Development] grant, and they called me to see if I'd like to come and work with them on this HUD grant, which was a national research grant of Model Cities programs.  It was a research project to evaluate the effectiveness of those programs to give inner city dwellers job skills that would be meaningful and help them to secure jobs that would pay a living wage.  So we worked in the Model Cities [Program] across the U.S.  We were in Harlem, Chicago; we were in L.A. right after the Watts riots.  We were in Asheville and western North Carolina was not a very safe place to be.  LL:  Buncombe County, yeah.  JW:  Yeah, if we were working there, we had to be&#8212;well, I was the only white person on that project, and when we worked in Asheville, we could never stay anywhere there overnight.  We had to go early in the morning, get our work done and come home to Raleigh because, in all the other places we had no problems traveling together or staying together, but in Buncombe County we never spent the night because it was a dangerous thing to do.  It was a dangerous thing to do.  When I came to Raleigh to take that job, my husband took over.  He worked with a program called Jobs for Ex-Offenders, where the Justice Department had given a grant to the state of North Carolina to help prisoners find jobs in the community because that was at a time that if you had a record&#8212;  LL:  You couldn&#8217;t get a job.  JW:  You couldn&#8217;t get a job.  My husband&#8217;s a very successful salesperson so he got banks to hire forgers.  I mean&#8212;  LL:  Wow.  JW:  Isn&#8217;t that great?  Because who knows forgery better than somebody who&#8217;s been in prison for forging, right?  He got people to hire murderers, people who murdered because of&#8212;usually it was some kind of passionate thing where someone had caught their wife in bed with another friend, and they murdered their friend.  I don&#8217;t mean to make lightly of&#8212;  LL:  No.  JW:  But the murderers that he helped find jobs were people who really were generally nice people. But I mean if you or someone you loved were threatened in some way, you might end up doing&#8212;hopefully not.  Hopefully you&#8217;d have more control, but I mean it is feasible.  So he was very successful in that, and then he changed to the business world.  He went from there to association management.  That&#8217;s when we moved to Syracuse, New York, and he&#8217;s from upstate New York.  And that&#8217;s where he hired the first African American with the company that he was working with, the first woman and opened up opportunities.  It&#8217;s amazing how you can do that at the onset, and those people are so successful, and [in] two years, it&#8217;s nothing unusual for them to do that.  But it takes the first person to take that step.  And you get a lot of criticism for it and you say, &#8220;But he&#8217;s very good at reading people, people who can be successful in sales.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see how it&#8217;ll work.  There&#8217;s nothing bad that could really happen as a result of this.&#8221;  But then it just changes everything in two years.  I mean something that&#8217;s so simple. It just has to have somebody that [as] part of their character want[s] to do that because the easier route is not to consider that and to avoid it altogether.  You don&#8217;t have the criticism from your superiors.  It&#8217;s just an easier path for you.  But to speak up for somebody&#8212;and again, it&#8217;s not done [with] a &#8220;Here we are&#8221; placard.  It&#8217;s, &#8220;I have hired this person.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know how to explain it other than the fact it&#8217;s got to be part of your character.    LL:  So I&#8217;m curious as to how you two tried to impart some of these lessons of social justice&#8212;  JW:  With our children?  LL:  With your children.  JW:  I don&#8217;t know.  You just have to live it, I guess.  When we were in Syracuse, we chose a multi-cultural daycare center.  And our older daughter got into a fight one day&#8212;and she&#8217;s a very gentle, young little girl.  She was three years old, four years old, and the childcare worker, when I picked her up, said, &#8220;You need to ask Jennifer about her day.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Well, what happened?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;She got into a fight.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;My Jennifer got into a fight?  That just doesn&#8217;t make sense.  What happened?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Ask her on the way home?&#8221;  So we were driving home and I said, &#8220;Jennifer, what happened today at school?&#8221;  &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;  And we talked a little bit further.  And she said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to tell you what happened.  You know that new kid that just came in?&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  &#8220;He called Mrs. Smith, who was one of her teachers, black.  And so I told him to stop calling her that.  She was not black.  And we got into a fight.  He wouldn&#8217;t do it.  He kept on doing it.  And so we got into a fight.&#8221;  Mrs. Smith was as dark as our pants.  She did not know, she did not know she was dark.  Children don&#8217;t see colors.  But she knew somewhere along the way that black was not good.  Somewhere that had been picked up, that that was not good.   LL:  So when he said that&#8212;  JW:  Yeah, so when he said that, she got into a fight over it.  We just taught our children what we were taught, and that is you treat people with respect.  And sometimes you might have to stand up for people when they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t stand up for themselves. So she ended up as a social worker.  Right now she&#8217;s a stay at home mom, but she became a social worker not because of my influence.  And then the younger daughter, as I said, had a degree at Indiana University.  She had a joint degree in English and Gender Studies.  She got a lot of flak for that and a lot of guffaws: &#8220;How are you ever going to get [a job]?&#8221;  LL:  From her peer group or adults or&#8212;?  JW:  Both.  &#8216;How are you ever going to get a job with that,&#8221; and that kind of thing.  When she was still working in arts administration, she had opportunities&#8212;they were giving out grants.  New York City has more grants for arts and arts development than the U.S. government.  Her job was to encourage new groups to make application for some of these grants.  She used her position to try to get groups that had not applied for grants before, like Asian groups or female groups.  It ran the gamut&#8212;museums, dance, sculpture, art&#8212;whatever the arts was very liberally interpreted as being.  But she has as real knack for finding and encouraging burgeoning artists and she could work [with] them to help them know that this money is available and they could apply for it and how to apply for it.  Then there was a certain period where they had to stop and then the application had to come on their own.  Both of our girls just, they have friends of all groups, and they&#8217;re just, they&#8217;re wonderful daughters.  LL:  So I&#8217;m wondering if I can ask you to reflect back on your many different activities and [the] many different places you&#8217;ve lived&#8212;you grew up for a good chunk of time in North Carolina and in the South and you&#8217;ve lived here or Alabama.  How did living in the South or growing up in the South influence your activism and has it limited your activism in any ways?  Have you felt differently about the times when you&#8217;ve been in the South versus the rest of the country in terms of how that influences your social justice?    JW:  When we were in Chicago, I worked with that program, which was basically taking on the public agencies as well as society in general.  When I lived in Ohio, I worked with Shaker Heights Equal Opportunity Housing program.  That program has been sued left and right.  Nobody has ever won.  I don&#8217;t know if you know about that program, but their housing program is focused on getting balanced diversity in all parts of the community.    When I was living in Syracuse working in the hospital, I was constantly advocating for patients against physicians.  For instance when you&#8217;re working in a medical center like UNC or Duke, you have people from all different cultures, and I happened to be working on a service where there was an Iranian doctor who was a cancer specialist, and he one day called me and said, &#8220;I want this woman out of the hospital.  She won&#8217;t take my chemotherapy.  She&#8217;s going to die.  Since she won&#8217;t take it I want her out of the hospital today.&#8221;  I went up and talked to her, and I found out, I could tell that she was, from her accent that she was probably from the South along the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina.  She was probably a Gullah.  And sure enough she was, and I asked her if she understood what the doctor had told her about her disease.  She said she did.  And I asked her if she understood that if she didn&#8217;t take this medicine, she would die very quickly.  She said she did.  And I said, &#8220;Well, tell me a little bit more about that.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;He told me that he would have to put a needle in my arm,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;That lets in evil spirits.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Oh, I know a little bit about your religion.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Does that mean if he can give this to you in another way, that you might take it?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Yeah, but I&#8217;m not going to have any needles put in my arm.&#8221;  And so I talked to the doctor.  I said, &#8220;This woman is not crazy.&#8221; He thought she was crazy because she wouldn&#8217;t take&#8212;.  I said, &#8220;She&#8217;s not crazy.  She just has a belief system that will not allow you to puncture her body.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Give this to her in a different way.&#8221;  He said, &#8220; We can&#8217;t do that.  That&#8217;s totally not allowed.  It&#8217;s not possible.&#8221;   He said, &#8220;I want her out of here tomorrow.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, it might take a while for me to make arrangements for home health care and all that.&#8221;  And the next day he called me and he said, &#8220;I want you to know I spent my whole night not being able to sleep because of you.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, why is that?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I've called all over the country,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;You bothered me,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, why am I bothering you?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I can give that medicine in a cocktail, I found out.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;But you understand it&#8217;s not as going to be as effective.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Meet me in her room.&#8221;  So I went up to her room and we had a discussion and he changed his way of thinking and doing and took into consideration her religious beliefs, which had an impact on treatment even though he didn&#8217;t think it was going to be as effective.  It&#8217;s interesting because over the next five years they resorted more to the use of a chemotherapy cocktail instead of just IV [intravenous].  But so no matter where you live, it doesn&#8217;t make any difference where you live.  There are always social justice issues.    LL:  Absolutely, either nationally or internationally.  JW:  Always.  So I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s a North-South thing.  You either do it or you don&#8217;t.  And it&#8217;s either part of you or it&#8217;s not.  It&#8217;s almost like having, like where people have these little metal detectors at the beach and you look at the beach and you don&#8217;t know whether there&#8217;s anything.  But those little metal detectors come along and you can pinpoint the little pieces of metal.  It&#8217;s sort of like that.  I think people who have this commitment to respect and social justice, it&#8217;s just always there. It&#8217;s always there.  It just pops up, in a hundred places and a hundred different ways.  You can be talking with your friends and somebody makes a comment about an older person or they make a comment about somebody&#8217;s weight or they make a comment about I don&#8217;t know&#8212;a hundred different things.  It&#8217;s just an opportunity and you don&#8217;t, the trick is to address that in such a way that they don&#8217;t get offended or turned off, but it really makes them think about themselves.  How do you put yourself in that person&#8217;s position and how would you want people to respond to you?     LL:  Well, is there anything I haven&#8217;t asked that you want to add or anything&#8212;  JW:  I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;ve just rambled on for an hour and a half.    LL:  No, it&#8217;s been great.  It&#8217;s been great.  JW:  So yeah, you just have to, everybody has to take responsibility for that.    LL:  I think that&#8217;s a great way to wrap up.  JW:  Okay.  LL:  Okay, thank you so much.  JW:  Yeah, if you look through your recordings and you might want to ask me some&#8212;
