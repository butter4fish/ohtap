Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell: This is Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell and I am here interviewing Serena Garcia, and we&#8217;re going to talk about SisterSong and reproductive justice in the South. So I just wanted to start out with kind of a general question about who you are and where you come from. I notice you&#8217;re from St. Simons Island?        Serena Garcia: Yes.        CGD: Can you tell me a little bit about where you&#8217;re from?        SG: Yes. St. Simons Island is on the very coast of Georgia. We&#8217;re one of the barrier islands that are along the coast of Georgia and also that leads up to South Carolina, and when you talk about southeast Georgia you&#8217;re talking about areas that are considered a very strong part of the Gullah/Geechee culture. The Gullah/Geechee culture started off, in terms of proximity, in the northern areas of Florida and it moves along the coast of Georgia as well as to the southern and mid parts of South Carolina. So you have generations of families that are descendants of former slaves in those areas. The Gullah/Geechee culture is one of culture, one of language, one of food, one of spirituality, one of embracing and preserving our African-ness and our history, and also different ways of life. Growing up in that environment really afforded me the opportunity to get closer to my African-ness, and I consider myself an Afro-Latina. My mother is full Mexican and my dad is Haitian and also Geechee, so I have a triad going on, and the different cultural bases that I come from all revere indigenous culture. Also too I was very thankful to be in an environment, family wise, that did certainly embrace that and preserve those traditions, whether they be of the indigenous Mexican culture in general or that of the Gullah/Geechee culture. So I have less of the Haitian exposure, unfortunately, but I am working on that in my adulthood, to gain that understanding and awareness too.        CGD: Did your parents meet on St. Simons?        SG: My parents met in El Paso, Texas. My dad was just coming from his first tour in the military, in the army at that time, in the late [19]60s in Vietnam, so he had been shell shocked, and sadly he came back a very wounded soldier, not so much physically but mentally and psychologically wounded. He was placed at a local military hospital at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas and my mother was brought in with several other Mexican women to provide comfort, if you will, to the soldiers. There was an interesting placement of Mexican women at that time [in] the military hospitals in the area. They were not quite as innocent as candy stripers, nor were they as blatant as prostitutes or escorts, but there was this grey little area that they fell in. So these very young Mexican women, I&#8217;m unsure whether they were coerced to come &#8211; which I&#8217;m sure they were &#8211; but I don&#8217;t think many of them came too voluntarily [Laughs] on many different levels.         When she was brought there she was brought to bring some companionship to the soldiers and she and my dad met and somehow an instant connection happened and they fell in love. They were not able to be married legally in the U.S. of course at that time in the late [19]60s, especially in that area.        CGD: Because it was an interracial marriage.        SG: Absolutely, [an] interracial relationship. For interracial marriage to take place they had to elope to Juarez, Mexico, which was right across the border. Their love led them to elope and get married where they could be married safely and legally. So when you look at the term &#8220;reproductive justice,&#8221; that may have been one of my earlier, not memories, but certainly later in life, one of my earlier understandings of the impact of that, because reproductive justice principles are very seriously noted in SisterSong&#8217;s work. We talk about three different things: the right for a woman to parent, not parent, and parent the children that they do have, but that also includes the right to marry who you want to marry. That&#8217;s a reproductive injustice, to simply base on the fact that my whole upbringing was one that was based on scorn and shame in the black community, as it was in the Mexican community, and certainly the more mass community.         By virtue of them having to go to another country to get married, when I was born, I was very much a secret in the family. My birth represented one of change on both sides of the family, and so that interracial child now begat other problems. Because there was so much racism in our immediate area in El Paso, Texas, my dad decided it would be best to go to southeast Georgia, of all places. So [it&#8217;s] racist in southeast Georgia but if it were better in southeast Georgia, then we needed to do that rather than staying in El Paso, Texas. And so we moved. My birth at that time posed a major problem for our families that were in El Paso, Texas at that time, and so when we fled we came to St. Simons Island. And I was raised there, so then I was more saturated around the culture of the Gullah/Geechee connection there and it was very interesting.         So another RJ [Reproductive Justice] situation that happened in my childhood that I do remember was one of racism, and also ethnocentrism in addition. Because we were living in a predominantly white/black neighborhood, and the entire St. Simons island proximity, which is white or black &#8211; there was no grey in between or any other cultures at that time. Part of my family were the only Latinos that were living in that area at the time, so that posed a problem, understandably so at that time during the late [19]60s to early [19]70s, understandably.        CGD: What types of problems?        SG: So when I speak of problems I&#8217;m talking about just the mere awareness of other cultures that exist, that coexist in this country. Because it was a predominantly white and black environment, there was not much openness towards other cultures and other races at that time, as there still is to some great degree now. But it was more blatant in the early [19]70s when I came. The other problems would be acceptance of our difference in culture, our oftentimes difference in religion. You&#8217;re talking about a population of Gullah/Geechee people that more so related to Southern Baptist religions. A smaller more undercover group of that would more so relate to what would be considered an offshoot of Yor&#249;b&#225; African tradition, which we call the roots back home. Sometimes secretism crept in so we would hide our Orisha, or our deities or saints or spirits, behind that of Catholic saints or spirits on occasion. But when you&#8217;re looking at a larger group of people that really truly embrace this as being an interracial family and child, it actually was the gay community that embraced us far more. There was a small gay community that was there at that time and same sex&#8212;.        CGD: At St. Simon?        SG: Yes, same sex relationships, more so male, and of course white. Black same sex relationships among men were of course not acceptable but they were more acceptable amongst white men. The white gay community embraced our differences and somehow they saw intersectionality. They saw that we were struggling for some of the same rights and justice. Sometimes when you&#8217;re in a struggle you oftentimes want to seek out people who are also struggling too, to provide a unified front. So we were invited into their homes; we were invited into their social networks; and we thrived and survived amongst them and were protected by them oftentimes, even before we were protected by the black community. It took awhile for the black community to really embrace us at the time.        CGD: And so your parents, because they became part of this community&#8212;. Now did they have any previous bias against same sex couples?        SG: My parents did not, as far as I&#8217;m aware of, they did not. And so to be embraced &#8211;. No, it was very comforting. It was very comforting to us as a family to know that there were other groups of people who were different, like we were, in the mainstream scheme of things. We could relate to them, so we stayed close with them for a number of years. So again my earlier reproductive justice exposure before I was born, obviously, with the interracial relationship and marriage that could not even happen in El Paso, Texas during that time frame. And then being a product of a marriage and not being accepted equally as well by either side of the family. And then moving into a community of black people and we are in fact more embraced by the gay community, which was so rare in the early [19]70s anyway for there to be gay couples that were there.         So the lineages going back to my experience are really far deep and before I can even say the most impactful&#8212;. Well that was the most impactful, too, in my life in terms of experiencing racism and classism as well on St. Simons Island. You had a number of families that were extremely affluent and very prosperous and influential and so us being low income was also another struggle. Dealing with the economic situations and conditions that we were placed under, living in a community of other low-income families but amidst the masses on St. Simons Island that had very infinite bank accounts and certainly more influence than what you really want to deal with. And so they expect you to stay in your place on the island. You were of color; you stayed in your place. You didn&#8217;t go into their neighborhoods. You didn&#8217;t spend time at their beaches. We had our own separate beaches. There were no signs, but the unspoken rule was that this was the black beach; this was the white beach. This was in the early [19]70s. So the only place that we were valued around them and their circles were as housekeepers and grounds men.         CGD: And so did your mother ever talk about her experience being brought to be a comfort woman?        SG: Very rarely, very rarely. I think it was something that she obviously was very bothered by and she didn&#8217;t feel open enough to talk about it. Other indirect family members talked to me more about it, far more than she did, and so I can only imagine some of the experiences that she had. I do know that at one time she was&#8212;. Some could perceive this as sex work. She was a go-go dancer back in the late [19]60s and to a degree that could be considered sex work, certainly, depending on the situation. She is supposedly getting some type of&#8212;or giving some type of&#8212;services, providing some type of services, from a sexual standpoint, or sensual, or through the physical body. Yeah, I think I probably would consider that to be sex work, absolutely. So that may have been the foray into her coming into being a comfort woman, if you will.         This is not my first time hearing about this kind of background for another mixed race child. My last husband was, too, a product of a very similar situation. He is Vietnamese and black and his mother was a prostitute in Vietnam, back in the late [19]60s, mid [19]60s, and she came across a black soldier that she subsequently fell in love with and had a child by him. She was very much a part of sex work, and I don&#8217;t think that was voluntary for her either, obviously, in Vietnam during that time, but she did keep that child.         So that&#8217;s a reproductive justice standpoint as well: the ability to take care of your child and keep your child, as my mom chose to keep me. It was her choice. She could have had a back alley abortion, knowing about the racism that would been looming overhead with her making the decision to keep that child. But she decided to keep it anyway, and so I was glad that she did. Sadly my parents did not stay together much longer than maybe five or six years and by them not staying together it created a much more devastating impact for me. So when you look at conservatives who are pitching messages around the shame of black women making decisions around their reproductive bodies and choices around how they want to lead their families or how they don&#8217;t want to provide for any other children outside of what they may already have&#8212;. Just by saying that black women need to consider two options instead&#8212;adoption or foster care&#8212;and [reducing] that just to those two options and nothing else is absolutely ridiculous. Knowing full well I was five seconds away, probably, from being in an adoptive situation at best and, at worst, in foster care. When my parents split up neither one of them decided that they were going to take full responsibility for me. They both left and went their own separate ways and I was dropped in the middle and dropped off at my maternal grandmother&#8217;s front door, literally. So neither one of my parents took full responsibility as a parent, which again&#8212;your right to parent.         After they left me, a multitude of issues began to hover over me because I was extremely vulnerable to society at that time, not having strong parental roles in place. My grandmother now had to work several jobs to take care of us, the two of us. She was oftentimes gone from home so she had to put me in the care of other people in the community. I had a godmother, a black woman, who was very much in her senior years. At that time seniors would be more than willing to take care of neighborhood kids. At the same time there were certain things that, if they felt like they had trust of other people who were around them, they just did. This person that&#8217;s in their family, they just know they can trust them. They would think that the perpetrators would be living down the street or homeless or someone who may have a mental illness or someone who is a substance abuser. So I was very much protected by the outside community, but as we know, in 2011, oftentimes the perpetrator is not going to be that same stranger from down the street or somebody that you just come in contact with. Sometimes and oftentimes it&#8217;s going to be someone that you know and someone who&#8217;s been brought into the family. When you look at some of the stories that Anne Rice [author of the novel, Interview with the Vampire] created for the New Orleans area and you look at the entr&#233;e of the vampire, [for] the vampire to come into a person&#8217;s home, that person has to open the door. The person has to open the door, and the same thing happened with me. By virtue of me not having the protective systems in place, the door was open for the vampire to come in. When the vampire comes in then, they prey. That&#8217;s what they do. So that&#8217;s exactly what happened.         I was eight years old and it went on continuously, with this one person who was a relative of my godmother, for the next two years. So I suffered in silence, and to be very honest, at that age, the way that I rationalized what was happening&#8212;I knew it was wrong&#8212;but when I looked at the situation at eight years old and saw how me and my grandmother were living, which was not extreme poverty but still very low income to where we couldn&#8217;t afford certain services or health care or a car or air conditioning or things like that. Because she had to work so much to try to take care of our rent and she was often gone, [I was] in the care of the landlord sometimes, and the landlord was the relative of my godmother, and they had a son that was considerably older than me. He was already a young man when I was only eight years old. So by my godmother thinking that this family member was going to be someone that she could trust and that we could trust, oftentimes when she turned her back she put me in the care of him and delivered me right into the hands of the vampire. So that meant complete and full access. But because his father was our landlord, I felt the responsibility for maintaining our house was bent on me taking the responsibility for providing for the needs that he had in mind. Even though they were wrong needs, I still felt like it was my responsibility to keep a roof over our head, and so that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t say anything. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t tell.        CGD: So what happened to stop the abuse at ten?        SG: He finally moved away. It wasn&#8217;t going to stop on its own. I didn&#8217;t have the wherewithal to stop it and I was too fearful to tell the family. For one, for fear of us losing our home, and number two, for fear of them not believing me. I&#8217;m this little biracial child who has extremely low value in the community as it is, so what value do I have? This is my thinking at eight years old, obviously, and so the only reason why it stopped was because he went to college. That was the only reason why it stopped. That was the only reason why it stopped, and I didn&#8217;t disclose it to my family on my mother&#8217;s side until I was getting ready to graduate from high school. There was a mental blockage of it for some number of years. Sometimes when children go through extreme psycholog[ical] trauma they block things out. They block out memories in their mind, and they&#8217;re blocked out for so long.         As I began my teenage years, becoming a young woman, I think the way that began to manifest itself was in substance abuse. That&#8217;s how it began to manifest itself. It didn&#8217;t manifest itself in terms of sexual promiscuity by any means. I was extremely selective and very protective about that. In fact after the first time that I had sex with someone I went to my dad immediately and told him that he needed to get me on the birth control pill like tomorrow, because I&#8217;d just started having sex last night. After my dad passed out&#8212;. [Laughs]        CGD: How old were you?        SG: I was sixteen. I was sixteen years old and I gained strength sometime during that time frame, as I mentioned to you before, to confront my perpetrator. I found the strength to do that after I had enlisted into the military and I knew what I was going to do with my life and I felt empowered somehow. I saw him on the street one day. He came back and I saw him and stopped him, and I very boldly announced to him, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to do this again. You had the opportunity to do it without any consent from me whatsoever, but I&#8217;m sixteen years old now. It&#8217;s been eight years; I dare you to try now. I dare you to try it now. I&#8217;m taking everything back and I&#8217;m not going to be silent anymore. I&#8217;m going to start telling people about it, and you can call me a liar if you want to but it&#8217;s the truth. I&#8217;m not going to allow you or any other man or any other person to silence me again and take my liberties from me. I&#8217;m going to always put that in the forefront of my agenda from now on, so thank you for that.&#8221;         Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn&#8217;t someone I was in love with, it wasn&#8217;t someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you&#8217;re ready, let&#8217;s get condoms and let&#8217;s go.&#8221; He looked at me and said, &#8220;Well don&#8217;t you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Keith Sweat is not needed. I&#8217;m ready to have consensual sex and either you&#8217;re going to be my partner or I&#8217;m going to find somebody else,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Okay, well I guess I&#8217;ll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together.&#8221;         So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, &#8220;I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven&#8217;t done anything else for me. I need you to do this. At least protect me from having children that I know I can&#8217;t take care of.&#8221; My grandmother was completely against the idea of me being on the pill because she was Catholic and so she was very much a conservative[ly] minded woman from the standpoint of family planning and pregnancy prevention. So I went to somebody who I knew would say yes. I cornered him [Laughs] into saying yes.         So that was my upbringing, coming up as a young woman. Then I went into the military and enlisted in the army reserves for eight years. While I was serving my duty in Savannah, I was also matriculating at Savannah State, then College, in communications. So now I begin to have a vehicle to tell my story and a vehicle to talk about different reproductive justice issues. HIV at that time, coming out of the late [19]80s, was a very serious topic of concern in our community. I most certainly was very involved in providing awareness and prevention information to my classmates at Savannah State.        CGD: What did you actually do?        SG: What did I do? I figured the best way for me to be heard would be to have an official position at Savannah State. I didn&#8217;t think that organizing by myself, singlehandedly, would work. I needed to be in office. So I had two decisions: either I was going to run for student government or I was going to run for Miss Savannah State. I said, &#8220;What would be the most awkward thing to do? Let me find the most difficult thing to do. The easiest way to pull off an HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness campaign would be as the SGA president or vice president. Let me find a nontraditional means to have a very political platform.&#8221; [Laughs] So I decided Miss Savannah State&#8217;s going to be my medium. I had already been preparing for some years anyway for pageantry by running for different pageants. [I] won two of three and [in] the third one was first runner up. I&#8217;d already gained some insight on the public speaking part and the preparation and the planning, so I was just readying myself for Miss Savannah State, to unveil this political platform and agenda. In a very awkward way I presented my HIV and AIDS awareness campaign on the campus of Savannah State College and it was met with some very open mouths and shock, because no one was talking about HIV at that time.        CGD: What year was this?        SG: This was back in [19]89. We weren&#8217;t talking about it on the black college level. We weren&#8217;t talking about it, especially in the Deep South. It was something that you just didn&#8217;t discuss. So I brought on together different county health officials and practitioners and asked them what would be a good plan to bring awareness on the campus. So they gave me some agenda items to talk about to bring some rallies together, to have some discussions, and I thought, well, what else could I do that would be controversial to push this whole agenda? So during the week of campaigning I spent two days giving out condoms on campus while the other young ladies were giving out ice cream cones.        CGD: Wow. That must have sparked dialogue. [Laughs]        SG: [Laughs] It did. It did. The faculty and the staff of the college were less than impressed with my move [Laughs] to distribute condoms, but by the time the word got around to them that I was giving out free condoms at my table the condoms were already gone anyway so there was no evidence. What condoms? So it was very impactful and I think that that and a really good strategic plan for mobilizing voters and organizing voters, I think that that certainly led to a win, because certainly from a notoriety standpoint I was certainly the lesser known underdog, but that helped propel my publicity, so it was good PR. It was really good public relations.        CGD: Did it get out of the campus that you were doing it? Did it make other news media?        SG: It didn&#8217;t make any other news media, the campus made certain that it didn&#8217;t as best as they could, but certainly it got around: Serena is giving out condoms for HIV prevention. You ought to go see her and get a pamphlet. Go get a brochure. She&#8217;s got some folks who are going to come on campus and talk about it and maybe we want to listen into that. So the campaign was sealed, the votes came out and I won, and I was able to use my platform the way that I wanted to use my platform, in conjunction with the student government association and the college. They were a little concerned about the radicalness of the platform, but they said, &#8220;well, we&#8217;ll give it a shot,&#8221; [Laughs] and see what happens, and so it was met with a little less resistance than I thought it would be.        CGD: They didn&#8217;t try to talk you out of it?        SG: Yeah, of course they did initially, of course they did. They wanted something far more sedate and comfortable. But what I explained to them was: Did you see how fast my condoms went when I gave them out? That&#8217;s got to tell you something. That&#8217;s got to tell you something. So I also produced a mini film about HIV awareness and interviewed&#8212;. Because I was in the communications department I figured I&#8217;ll use my major, communications, to get some messaging out, and so the first mini documentary that I ever produced was one in college about HIV awareness and interviewed the health practitioners at the local health center and certainly gave some really good resources at the end of the mini documentary. So it worked out well and had students to be able to view it, so it turned out well.         CGD: So when did you actually hear about reproductive justice, because it sounds like your life in some ways, really you lived reproductive justice and reproductive injustice, but when were you able to put a name to that?        SG: Right. Well it goes the same way that I look at the term &#8220;feminist.&#8221; I&#8217;d always lived as a feminist. I&#8217;d always lived with the truer understanding of what reproductive justice meant. I didn&#8217;t have to attend a women&#8217;s studies program at a private college to get that knowledge. I didn&#8217;t crack open a book and learn about what the early feminists and black feminists in particular, how they coined that term. I didn&#8217;t major in African American studies, I didn&#8217;t take sex and gender classes, so I certainly didn&#8217;t get it by the halls of academe by any measure; I lived it, completely and fully. So when a title finally presented itself I said, oh, this is what you call this, feminism, reproductive justice?         So when I found out what reproductive justice meant was when I was working&#8212;. I had been working in communications for a number of years and I was also working with foster care youth as well because my heart went out to them, and for obvious reasons I could really relate to them being abandoned by their parents as I was abandoned. So I was working with foster youth at that time and I was looking for a speaker to talk about sexuality and sexual freedom and sexual health. I just happened to be at a Latino festival, attending, and happened to go past a table that was hosted by the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center here in Atlanta and met with some of the Latinas there and talked to them and said I need a really good speaker to talk about the real, real aspects of sexual health that young people need to know. I don&#8217;t want it sugarcoated for the foster youth. I don&#8217;t want you to paint this picture of abstinence only. I want you to talk about it in very plain language and give them the facts also. They said they&#8217;d be willing to do it, so I brought them in to speak to my group of foster youth that I&#8217;d been working with, and it was a really good session, and the term &#8220;reproductive justice&#8221; began to creep up at that time.         So I developed an interest in it and got on their Lifting Latina Voices initiative with Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center and served as a marketing person. They didn&#8217;t have a full time marketing person at that time so I was just assisting them in different marketing towards the Latina community here locally, and one effort begat the other because the next following year to a year and a half I was asked to serve on the board of directors for the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center. So I did that and still assisted with communications, with their website, the redevelopment of that, and also messaging and mission statement. I had begun to learn more about reproductive justice but what I had not learned quite at that time was how closely it was interrelated to human rights, because there are some people who believe in reproductive justice without using the human rights framework, and we value them as well, but at SisterSong and many of our collective members and partners and allies, human rights comes up. It&#8217;s a part of it. It&#8217;s an integral core part of it. So I began to learn more about the human rights connectivity once I was able to find a role here at SisterSong on the staff.        CGD: Now how long have you been at SisterSong?        SG: I&#8217;ve been here for two years now. I&#8217;ve been here two years. So it was Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center that mentioned to me at that time that there was a new communications position opening up and it was going to be a first at the organization, and one of the Latina members of the group that I was a part of said, &#8220;I looked at the job description the other day and it sounds just like you. It sounds just like you. You&#8217;ve got to apply for that job,&#8221; and so I did. When I applied for it, it was at the same time in 2008 at the end of the year when SisterSong&#8217;s membership conference was taking place here in Atlanta, and so I interviewed with SisterSong two weeks prior to their conference and told SisterSong, I said, so you&#8217;ve got the opportunity to interview me and I&#8217;m going to interview you. I&#8217;m going to be attending the conference and see what I can find out about the response to SisterSong and its work from the membership base. So they said, yeah, we&#8217;d love to have you at the conference, so it was my first glimmer on finding out&#8212;. [Interruption 32:12 to 33:10]         CGD: So if you started here in&#8212;2010?        SG: Actually January, 2009. I attended the conference in 2008 in the fall and then I was offered a job at the end of 2008 and started January, 2009. So my charge was to create a functioning communications department which, Charity mentioned to you earlier, reproductive justice organizations, particularly the ones that are women of color led, it is a very serious luxury to have a full time policy person-slash-advocacy person, let alone a communications person or department, because both of us are in the same department. Dionne and I are in the same department, and so she works as a support system for the communications department&#8217;s needs. But, it is so rare to have either one of those positions full time. A lot of us just don&#8217;t have the money.        CGD: So there are two of you, and that&#8217;s a luxury.        SG: We are in two luxury positions, we really are, much needed positions, but luxury from the standpoint [that] it&#8217;s just very difficult for a lot of women of color led organizations to be able to find the funding to be able to bring extra capacity in like that, and that&#8217;s really not even extra capacity; that&#8217;s streamlined. At SisterSong we&#8217;re in very streamlined basic capacity. We could have three times as many staff and really be able to do some huge, huge things. We have a lot of tasks that have to be done to provide the needs for work and impact and outcomes with reproductive justice strategies, and mobilizing and organizing, but yes, our two roles certainly are by far very rare to find amongst women of color led organizations. They really are.        CGD: And so if you came in on 2009 then you were not here too long before a lot of things started happening, because 2010 was when we hear the Senate Bill 529, right, and the billboards, and so how did that all go down for you?        SG: It was a whirlwind. All of a sudden it just seems like I was just getting settled in well and just getting the strategic plan situated for what communications&#8217; role would be to support the work of SisterSong and then here comes Senate Bill 529 [officially named the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act]. The bill&#8212;and I&#8217;ll name it out&#8212;the OBGYN Criminalization and Racial Discrimination Act, when that came out and hit Georgia we had already seen some of the symptoms of the sore coming up anyway with the nasty anti-abortion billboards that were really making a very serious attempt to shame black women around their choices for reproductive choice and freedom.         CGD: Did you know about the billboards or the senate bill before they actually went live?        SG: We knew. We knew. We didn&#8217;t know just how strong the volume would be in terms of the billboard numbers that would come out and the numbers of billboards across the state of Georgia were just volumous [sic]. We&#8217;re talking in the numbers of eighty-some odd billboards that came out in Georgia, and we&#8217;re looking at how much those billboards cost to lease for every so many weeks. The cost is astronomical. You&#8217;re talking about a couple thousand dollars to lease one billboard over a period of maybe two months time, maybe three at the most. So we found out that CBS Outdoor Advertising was the lessor, I think you can say, and so it was interesting at that time because the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center had already been working on creating and publicizing a billboard that spoke about the services that they provided for women, and also the trans community too. So they wanted their messages put up around the same time, just ironically, or maybe it was directed. I don&#8217;t know. I wasn&#8217;t on the board at that time. I was already gone and here at SisterSong full time. So they wanted to provide a message to the community on the whole that reproductive health services were available and affordable and accessible here in Atlanta, so the word &#8220;abortion&#8221; was going to be on the billboard also. CBS Outdoor Advertising had a major issue with that word being on the billboard so they denied Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center the opportunity to lease the space with that verbiage, and so they were already very upset about this and was waging a war against CBS anyway. So now you&#8217;ve got these nasty billboards that are just saying terrible things about black children being an endangered species and being slapped right in the middle of our black communities here in Atlanta, and throughout the state really.         So we all wondered how is it that CBS Outdoor Advertising can allow a message like that to go on and be publicized with no problem but we can&#8217;t offer services and care on a billboard and give people the opportunity to be able to make decisions about how they want to run their lives? We can&#8217;t offer that option, but this other billboard gets to stay up instead. So there was this other sub-fight that was going on as well, in addition to the terrible policies that were going to be criminalizing abortion providers. That was a terrible thing that was happening. There was a lot of anger from the anti-abortion community towards Planned Parenthood in particular. It was like a witches hunt and they were coming after them and anybody else who affiliated themselves with them. That&#8217;s how we got involved. Anybody who was affiliated with it certainly was a target. So interviews in the media began to spur up. The first one was the New York Times, the New York Times came here twice to interview us about the situation, and when I say&#8212;that was the first national news media outlet.        CGD: And they actually came to Atlanta.        SG: Came right here, just where you&#8217;re sitting. But the first story that cracked was through the AJC [Atlanta Journal Constitution], through a column. There was a local columnist here at the AJC that really pitched the story first about the senate bill, and he talked about the billboards too. That just happened to be about the same time. So we got called into that story and the New York Times saw that story in AJC and picked up on it and then it led into a whirlwind of media frenzy, and from media frenzy it went to media failure. So now national news agencies are calling us left and right to interview us about what our stand is on the situation in Georgia, what are we going to do about it, what are we already doing about it, and so we had multitudes of interviews that were lined up back to back, back to back, from MSNBC to CNN, a second interview from New York Times, BBC, so many different national mainstream news outlets. Then the progressive news outlets began to come in and independent and feminist news outlets began to come in.         So the failure had happened with the national news outlets on a number of levels, and that was although we were being interviewed by radio and TV and print and web media through national news services the sound bites that we were truly given to talk about our perspective and our story and the impact truly that was happening on black women in particular, we were getting a much smaller and shorter time frame of being able to provide our information messaging than that of the anti-abortionists&#8217; messages, much more. So you would hear maybe a sound bite of two minutes of a thirty-minute interview and you&#8217;d hear ten from the other side that was being interviewed. You&#8217;d actually hear that much content from them. So it was unfair balance in terms of the length of time that we able to speak about our messages, the amount of inches in newspapers we were getting certainly, the amount of content that we were provided in other stories through other media outlets, and so that was one means of failure. The other means of failure was that we were also positioned in a way that black women and women of color were not able to speak on women&#8217;s issues. What I mean by that is there were times when national news media outlets would interview black men to talk about reproductive justice issues before you would ask a woman of color to talk about reproductive justice issues.         CGD: Did they have any favorite black male spokespeople?        SG: One of the interviewees was from the National Action Network, Rev. Al Sharpton&#8217;s organization, and I&#8217;m unsure if&#8212;. There was a black woman that helped run the Action Network. I&#8217;m not sure if she was there at the time when they were interviewing but I do know that they went right to a male, a black male staffer, who was in a very high ranking role and they interviewed him instead on a national news network, and it was also going to be a debate. It wasn&#8217;t just an interview it was a debate with Catherine Davis from Georgia Right to Life at that time. So let a black woman talk about her perspective from the anti standpoint, but they wouldn&#8217;t let a black woman talk about it from our standpoint. They chose a black man over talking to us. We should be asked questions about our own wounds, not someone who doesn&#8217;t have one.        CGD: So how did you reverse that? Has it been reversed?        SG: Well the issue, as I said, media failure. Media failure continues. Until you can get in the heads of editors and the heads of producers and other folks who are making major decisions at news outlets, until you can get into their heads it&#8217;s going to be a process. It&#8217;s going to be a process of helping them to understand, and it just so happens that we are going to be looking at really creating some serious communications tool kits and they will be for fellow activists and advocates that are already working the movement, but they&#8217;re going to also have to be for the mainstream media too. The mainstream media only know what they know, and so sometimes when you point the finger at their ignorance they either want to try to change that ignorance and be open or they&#8217;ll continue to be closed. So I&#8217;m hopeful that we will at least, in the very near future, be able to have some training with some national news outlets and say, hey, these are reproductive justice issues, which are also human rights issues too, by the way. You might want to provide that angle when you&#8217;re interviewing and provide that perspective and not be so biased on the content so that it&#8217;s just landing on the conservative side. Give us fair and balance coverage. That&#8217;s what any news reporter is supposed to do.         CGD: So if you think there was a media failure in the ways in which media approached and represented the issue and the debate,&#8212;        SG: National media.
CGD: &#8212;who they chose to have as spokespeople, was there any success, particularly around the billboard, whether it was mobilizing&#8212;? Were there some successes associated with the billboards? I know you had some success with the senate bill.
SG: We did. Of course there&#8217;s going to be a difference of opinion of how the billboards came down. We look at our successes here in Georgia really by rallying political figures locally, particularly political figures of color, and also women, and so we really spent a long time talking with them and having conversations about the relevance of reproductive justice and how impactful this is in our community and how they need to stand in solidarity against criminalizing of abortion providers and other reproductive health providers. So we were able to get to them and they understood what we were saying, so we got the buy in from them, which was good. I think the other thing too that happened was that there was some wedge that was being built even between the anti-abortion community as well. There was some wedge that was being built. So we definitely were very influential in the ear of politicians of color and women politicians, but they also created their own divisiveness too on the other side of the camp in terms of conservatives. They created their own division mechanism and it was by accident, so a number of different variables helped bring the legislation down.         When you take at this report that I&#8217;m going to give you there&#8217;s a lot of background in terms of how we won and the different ways that we won, and some of it was response through&#8212;. A lot of it was response through media messaging, researching the opposition, reframing the debate, for example, developing the communications plan, providing data and facts, engaging faith communities, recruiting civil rights organizations, organizing the legislative strategy that I mentioned to you, bringing together medical and legal communities; so these are all the ways that we won. We didn&#8217;t win singlehandedly by one particular strategy; we won by integrating all of these different strategies. We had policy, advocacy, communications, bringing together influential members of the faith based community, other partners in different social justice movements, allies as well, so we won this battle in Georgia as a full frontal assault. It certainly wasn&#8217;t singlehanded by any means. Everything that SisterSong does is collective. We don&#8217;t do anything in a silo. We always work collectively.
CGD: So what were particularly black politicians&#8217; support&#8212;? I heard that black politicians&#8212;some black politicians, I&#8217;m not going to say all&#8212;were supportive of Senate Bill 529 initially, and maybe some of them remained so.
SG: Right.
CGD: So how do you&#8212;?
SG: Sometimes it depends on how quickly you&#8217;re able to get the information to [them], simply put, and also I did not want to omit certainly we have strong reproductive justice partners that are here that are women of color led organizations. That was our strongest hold to help us win the war of the policy issue here in Georgia. Sometimes politicians honestly will listen to who talks to them first and on so many occasions we found that conservatives were going to talk to different politicians and got to them first, and so then their mind was already made up after they left that meeting and the opposition provided just enough background to seal the deal, so we may not have been able to make any headway with that politician. So I certainly did not say that we won all. I said we talked to them, we discussed with them. There were some that we were able to sell on more than others and really have them understand the true issues that were going on with black women and how their issues should be on the forefront of agendas of all policies. Reproductive health issues need to be in the forefront, not some side backburner issue. And this is not a single issue, this is not just about abortion, and the conservatives were making it out to be as if it was just about abortion and it was so not about just abortion. It was not about that. It was about race, it was about class, it was about gender. The conservatives were trying very hard to build a wedge in between the black community, building a wedge by gender. There are so many different ways that they were coming at us, so we just had to really build a firm solidarity base of so many different groups of people who represented so many different communities and intersections, and that&#8217;s what really helped us win, was the collective work here in Georgia.
CGD: How long did it take for the billboards to come down?
SG: It took some months for them to finally come down. We did have a major rallying strategy around just the billboards themselves certainly, working again with partners and allies and getting our membership base to organize around getting those billboards down and coming after CBS Outdoor Advertising, coming after the conservatives: Shame on you for putting these billboards up in our communities and saying these terrible things about our babies that we love very dearly and that black women are not killing off their babies. Black women are in different situations for different reasons and recognize that, and if they decide to have a child, what are you going to do to help raise that child anyways? What are you going to do to offer any type of support to that woman when she has to parent that child? So those are the different strategies that we put in place to get the billboards down, and again the opposition will certainly say something totally different in that regard, that we weren&#8217;t successful. I&#8217;ve seen an article recently that said that it wasn&#8217;t us that brought the billboards down, but we know the truth. It was working together in solidarity collectively that brought those billboards down, absolutely, and we&#8217;ve had the same fight throughout the country. It started here in Georgia and it went on to other cities and states too.
CGD: So why do you think it started here in Georgia, at least with the billboards? Why is Georgia kind of ground zero for that part of the opposition?
SG: Well my personal perspective on that is going back to when Obama first came in office, and when you talk about a very pivotal meeting of white conservative Republicans who saw Obama getting ready to come in office several years ago, and they decided to have a meeting. We know this because a reporter talked about this in one of the articles in AJC, I think the same columnist in fact that broke the story about the legislation and billboards in reference to us. When you look at this early meeting several years ago, that happened on my hometown of St. Simons Island, naturally, the same site of the G8 summit from years before, when these white Republican conservative men came together and devised a plan to derail from a race, gender, class standpoint, and one of the ways that they looked at attacking is by criminalizing reproductive health providers. They knew this healthcare plan was coming out. They knew there was going to be some strong language in that. There was going to be a lot of pull on different sides regarding that. That was one way to provide some divisive strategies. So they&#8217;ve been working on this for some time now, it wasn&#8217;t anything they just happened to create all of a sudden, and Georgia just seemed like the right place to do it. It seemed like a very open place to get the amount of votes they needed to have and also a very impactful place in terms of black women, who are here in large population. It was the right temperature for the right pot, and all they had to do is put the right seasoning in.         What they didn&#8217;t realize is that we are so many in number. SisterSong is not just SisterSong, 1237 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd., Atlanta, GA. SisterSong is nationwide. SisterSong is women of color in allied organizations all across the country and beyond. They didn&#8217;t realize the collective spirit that we really had. No, our pockets are not nearly as deep as theirs, but our reach is very far, and they weren&#8217;t bargaining on that. So we remain to be a serious thorn in their side and a major obstacle even more so, so they had to really contend with that, so they moved on for awhile. They moved on from Georgia for awhile and then they managed to find their way back in the freedom rallies that came to Georgia much later on, and by virtue of them bringing this god-awful bus [Laughs] to Atlanta&#8212;.
CGD: What did the bus look like?
SG: Oh, I&#8217;ve got pictures. I can give you pictures.
CGD: Can you describe it?
SG: Yes. It looked like a rock star bus. It looked some major rock star [Laughs] was coming to town to play at Lakewood Amphitheater. That&#8217;s what it looked like. It was the most disgusting, ridiculous, silly looking bus I&#8217;ve ever seen and I&#8217;m not [Laughs] saying that just to be biased, but it really was. It looks so awful for this prolife group of other organizations to plop so much money into the graphic design, the full-out extravagant graphic design that was layered on this bus. You couldn&#8217;t see the chrome for the images that were on this bus, and when I tell you they had certain black leaders that they had put, or so-called leaders, really, people that&#8212;their token leaders. Not our leaders, their token leaders, people like Alveda King, who&#8217;s had several abortions herself, [Laughs] case in point. Her face was draped all over the bus. You had other black figures whose faces were draped all over the bus, men. What was interesting is that they tokenized all these black people, including Catherine Davis, and positioned them in such a way to be the spokespersons for these prolife efforts, and then when the bus arrived&#8212;. We knew the bus was coming a long time ago and we knew they were rallying in Alabama first and they were going to make their way to Atlanta, so we were ready for them. We rallied up all the troops, we rallied up all the women of color organizations here in Atlanta that are RJ-oriented, and we had our horns ready, we had our information sheets ready, we already had the press kits ready, we already had the folks ready; we were there waiting on them, actually. We got there before they did.
CGD: That&#8217;s kind of like the original Freedom Ride crowds waiting on them&#8212;
SG: Right, right, right.
CGD: &#8212;but in a different way.
SG: Right, right, right, it was total co-optation of the civil rights Freedom Rides, total co-optation. It was really stinky and very ugly. So we beat them before they got to the King Center, we beat them there about maybe an hour to an hour and a half. The National Park Service did not want us there rallying so they pitched a fit about us being there. Although we had already talked to them and gained clearance prior to, now all of a sudden now we can&#8217;t be there rallying. We&#8217;d have to go across the street to where the newer Ebenezer Church is, so we went across the street to the Ebenezer Church, and we waited for them and waited for them, and we talked and rallied and organized some more. So when this rock star bus pulled up in front of the King Center we looked at it in complete shock, and despite the black images that were on the structure of the bus what came off the bus was primarily middle aged white families, very conservative white families. Mostly middle aged white women and middle aged white men came off that bus. There were very few people of color that came off that bus. Alveda, of course, was on there, one or two other pastors were on there, and a gentleman who is the vice chair of the Republican Party of North Carolina, who is a black man.
CGD: Which one is that?
SG: Dr. Timothy Johnson, who I know very well, and of course he was carrying a cross-shaped wreath of flowers, and so what they were doing is they were eulogizing dead black babies, as they called it. They were eulogizing dead black babies. So they had a series of spiritual hymns and songs and [Laughs] so they were singing a lot of religious songs and praying. They were praying and praying and praying and praying to help these poor black babies that these black women have killed, so we just began to shout back and say, &#8220;Black women don&#8217;t kill babies; racism kills black babies.&#8221; So we were saying some very striking things in opposition to them, and we were giving out some good data too, and we reminded their constituency that, by the way, one of your spokespersons has had several abortions. Are you aware of that yourself? Now she wants to stop other women from having the opportunity and choice of abortions.
CGD: How do you know that?
SG: We did research, oppositional research.
CGD: Has she responded?
SG: No, she didn&#8217;t respond, not during that time. She responded in other ways and other interviews. We were always doing debate interviews with Alveda and Catherine Davis for months and months and months and months, and Ryan, of course, for months and months.
CGD: That&#8217;s the interesting thing about Atlanta, in that people are taking the civil rights mantle and using it in a lot of different ways, and so you occupy, since your headquarters is here, a very symbolic ground. So how does SisterSong garner that same kind of meaning, because they&#8217;ve done it in some ways very effectively?
SG: Well interestingly enough a lot of what the conservatives use are very ultra-sensational marketing techniques and sensationalism in general, so it&#8217;s the flash of their message, it&#8217;s the tone of their message that causes such an uproar. I don&#8217;t look at it as being effective because we have interviewed and researched so many black women about the situation with the billboards, across the country, we&#8217;ve done extensive research with other partners and allies, and found that on some occasions black women honestly just have not paid really close attention to the billboards, but so many of the women who have are very offended, very offended. So if anything they&#8217;ve been successful at is drawing attention to their platform and their agenda. They have been successful at that, but they&#8217;ve not been successful at just changing black women&#8217;s minds about their bodies. They&#8217;ve not been successful at that, which was what they were trying to do.         So how we had to really turn this around was again reframing the message, and that&#8217;s something that we talk about in our report when we&#8217;re talking about reframing the debate, and so some of the things that we talk about is reframing it so that people understand that this is a clear attack on black women and the options that they should have accessible and affordable to them. So, for example, I&#8217;m going to read some things to you that may help provide some context: &#8220;We also aggressively link women&#8217;s rights to civil and human rights,&#8221; so we link the human rights piece of it to it, because although you&#8217;ve got a lot of organizations that are conservative that are co-opting civil rights you have to go back to the very foundation of civil rights was human rights. You can&#8217;t forget that. So when you&#8217;re trying to say that this is civil rights, to protect the unborn, but you&#8217;re not protecting the woman herself, and that&#8217;s going completely against human rights. So, &#8220;We aggressively link women&#8217;s rights to civil and human rights to make a message that matters in the larger social justice context to thwart the divide and conquer mechanism and the blame and shame narratives of our opponents. Strategically using civil and human rights language from our reproductive justice framework demonstrated that we were authentically embedded in both movements versus that of our opponents.&#8221; We&#8217;re in both movements. That also said that our messages provided for our allies in civil and human rights movements to echo.         So it was not something that was extremely challenging to bring together other civil rights leaders&#8212;as we still are doing now&#8212;other human rights leaders, other leaders from other social justice organizations. Once they understand the intersection of all that and see that human rights is at the core of all of it, it makes sense for all of us to be on the same team. The opposition is not able to do that. For one, they&#8217;re basing their argument on a single issue situation, they&#8217;re basing so much of their messaging around abortion, but if you&#8217;re talking about leaving women with no opportunity to make choices, it&#8217;s not just about abortion. It&#8217;s about preventive means and having access to that. It&#8217;s about what happens if this is a young girl who&#8217;s been raped. What happens if this is a trans-woman who needs services? What if this is even a male who needs reproductive health services from a fertility standpoint?         So SisterSong is a collective, and as our framework we really don&#8217;t look at any single sex issues. We look at all issues that are impactful, that means all reproductive health issues, so I look at what I call the trinity: Reproductive justice, in terms of the movement building, there&#8217;s reproductive health, in terms of making sure that reproductive health services are accessible, affordable, and available to women, and then there&#8217;s the reproductive rights part of it, to make sure that policy understates that. Policy should also be able to provide not only protection but provision, not just protection but provision too. So that trinity is very important to us, so in all the different ways that we were able to defeat them we&#8217;re finding ourselves using the strategies that all of us put together as a means for a template, so that template has been very helpful for a lot of our partners who&#8217;ve experienced the same thing in L.A., in New York, in Tennessee, in so many other cities across the country where these nasty billboards are popping up. Now they&#8217;ve been delving into Latino communities in California, and so now with the latest one that you&#8217;re aware, the billboard that came out this week, now it&#8217;s pointing a finger at civil rights leaders and saying that civil rights leaders are now betraying them, so now they&#8217;re the next hit on the list of check-offs to make.
CGD: You think now that politicians are&#8212;that this is going to make them allies for you all?
SG: Absolutely, absolutely. Again, we&#8217;ve not had to try to twist people&#8217;s arms to understand what human rights means, and so those who truly have human rights at the core of their work, whether they be civil rights leaders, whether they be faith based leaders, community organizers, or other folks who are different social justice movements, we&#8217;ve not had to twist their arm. Once they understood that the human rights framework was a part what all of us were working towards it made sense for us to come together, as it will continue. That&#8217;s going to be our strength. The human rights framework is our strength, and bringing together other social justice movements is just going to cause us to be stronger and more solid in our organizing and mobilizing together. So thank you for trying to build a wedge between all of us, but that&#8217;s just going to make us feel a lot closer and pull our resources together, of intellectual means, of hopefully financial means, or organizing together, of demonstrating together, of standing side by side together.         And it&#8217;s not really a matter of denouncing pro-life efforts at all. SisterSong certainly does feel very open and very acknowledging and certainly accepting of people who prefer a pro-life theory. That&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;ve got a member of our management circle who is very pro-life and abstinence oriented. There&#8217;s a seat at the table for everybody but you can&#8217;t try to ramrod and make people feel as though your option is the only way and that&#8217;s the only means it should be but then you&#8217;re not trying to provide provision for the aftermath once that decision&#8217;s been made to have a child. Now what? We&#8217;re not even going to get into the discussion of the prison industrial complex and how many people are subjected to living in real time slavery. This is real time slavery.         So again, they&#8217;re not providing any provision. What we&#8217;re talking about is empowering people, educating people, helping them to find that voice, and that&#8217;s why SisterSong and reproductive justice resonates so strongly for me, is because my voice was taken at a very young age and so I just chose not to be a victim. I chose to be a survivor. You have two choices when things like that happen to you. I chose to be a survivor but in choosing to be a survivor that also meant that I would no longer be silenced. I wouldn&#8217;t allow anyone to silence me any longer. So here is the perfect place for my voice to be heard in the work that I do through communications and the work that I do to support policy and advocacy here and the work that I do to work with other movements and other social justice organizations and other RJ organizations. I&#8217;m no longer silenced, and I don&#8217;t think anybody else needs to be silenced, and we&#8217;re here to empower others to keep them from being silenced.
CGD: Well I think that is a wonderful place to stop. Thank you so much.
SG: You&#8217;re welcome. Thank you.
CGD: I appreciate it.
SG: Thank you.
