Joey Fink: It&#8217;s May 11, 2011. My name is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee at the University of Tennessee with Professor Suzanne Kurth. Dr. Kurth, could you start by telling me when you were born and where you&#8217;re from?
Suzanne Kurth: I&#8217;m from Illinois. I&#8217;m not really sure why you need my date of birth, because I don&#8217;t always give that out.
JF: Okay. What was your neighborhood like when you were growing up?
SK: I grew in the suburbs of Chicago. We lived in more than one but where we ended up was Glen Ellyn, which used to be far west. You know as the cities keep expanding [Laughs] the definitions change, but a relatively affluent suburb of Chicago.
JF: Was there an expectation that you would go on to college?
SK: Unquestioned.
JF: Unquestioned? Did you know you wanted to study sociology?
SK: I decided in high school when I took a high school sociology class that I wanted to study sociology.
JF: And what was your focus?
SK: Social psychology.
JF: Can you explain to me as a layperson?
SK: I try to study how people see themselves, how they&#8217;re influenced by other people.
JF: Okay. And you did your Ph.D. at the University of Illinois?
SK: At the University of Illinois-Chicago, yeah, because my mentor ended up there so that&#8217;s how I ended up there.
JF: Okay. And how would you characterize the atmosphere for women graduate students when you were there?
SK: Actually that department had two married couples in it, had women faculty members, a famous woman in sociology, so it was actually quite open, and I wanted to look at gender so I looked at differences in male and female self disclosure, so there was an openness to looking at gender, to women succeeding. The only thing I think that would be on the other side of the ledger there is people couldn&#8217;t see, and I think this plagues women to this day, how they&#8217;re going to balance an academic career. Does it mean really giving up on your sort of ideas of marriage and children if you pursue a full time academic career, so that&#8217;s what I remember as an issue for women in the program.
JF: Did you see the women who were successful in your area having to make that choice between a career and a family, or were there role models for people who were successfully balancing both?
SK: Certainly I was reading the literature at the time and looking at the people and what you undoubtedly know is that academic women have a lower probability of marriage and a lower fertility rate. It was true then and it&#8217;s still true today. [Laughs] So realistically it does make a difference.
JF: And when did you come to UT [University of Tennessee at Knoxville]?
SK: I came to UT in 1970.
JF: Did you come straight from Illinois or did you work somewhere else before?
SK: No, no, no. I&#8217;m not that old.
JF: [Laughs] Can you explain the process of how you got to UT, the hiring, the interviewing?
SK: At that time I think things still operated not all that differently in some ways than they do today, that you use social networks, okay, and so through those you could have higher probability of an interview somewhere, which was the case with Tennessee. I&#8217;d been to this region of the country before and liked it so I always sort of joked about that. It was the old boy network to which I feel primarily I got my job, but again while there&#8217;s a lot of window dressing today there&#8217;s a lot of, certainly at elite schools like Chapel Hill, of circulation, of who are your best graduates and, you know. I mean people do all that kind of stuff. This is the real world. Yes, there&#8217;s affirmative action; yes, we all advertise; yes, that&#8217;s all true. [Laughs] But in many ways the system is still one where there&#8217;s a hierarchy and there are social networks and social capital that sort of perpetuate a system.
JF: I spoke with a woman in the biology department at UNC who started there in [19]84 and she had a real interesting perspective on women in the sciences. She just said it&#8217;s a culture that values this sort of aggressive, dominant, competitive spirit that white males are usually encouraged to possess and exhibit and women are not. Would you say that characterizes social sciences as well?
SK: No, not as much. Certainly one of the things that I sort of fell into was teaching for a graduate student seminar in philosophy of the social sciences and through that have looked at people like Sandra Harding and Evelyn Fox Keller and their arguments about science and the masculine nature of the hard sciences as they&#8217;ve evolved. I don&#8217;t think they have to be that way but that&#8217;s been the dominant kind of mode, certainly. If you&#8217;ve ever read the book The Double Helix about Watson and Crick and DNA you get a perfect model of that macho, [Laughs] shoving the other guy with the elbow so that you can get ahead and be famous and stuff, but I don&#8217;t see the social sciences as [being as] testosterone-laden as that.
JF: About how many women would you say were in the sociology department when you arrived in [19]70?
SK: I was the first tenure track woman in the department and sometimes we&#8217;d have lecturers. I can&#8217;t remember if we briefly had another woman in the 1970s for a short period of time. I guess there were two women briefly. By the 1980s then we did much better, but there was a substantial period of time when I was the only tenured or tenure track woman in the department.
JF: What was your office like? Did you have an office when you got here, this office?
SK: Just like this one. Not this one but&#8212;. I mean I worked for a number of years as the campus ombudsperson so I had an office somewhere else and then I was department head for awhile so I&#8217;ve moved offices around, but parallel to this office, yes. [Laughs]
JF: And did you meet other women in other departments? Were there networks across campus for&#8212;?
SK: Yes, of course. You couldn&#8217;t have survived if you didn&#8217;t have other people. One of my friends was in history, which was in the same building at the time, friends in psychology and various other departments.
JF: Did you know Susan Becker?
SK: Yeah. Susan was one of my friends.
JF: I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t get to meet her. One of the things that I&#8217;ve heard women faculty members talk about when they would come into a male dominated department in the [19]70s is sort of little things, like day to day things that they noticed. Male colleagues would be referred to as &#8220;Professor&#8221; and &#8220;Dr. So-and-so&#8221; and they would be referred to as &#8220;Jane&#8221; or &#8220;Barbara&#8221;, being asked to get coffee in a meeting, or something like that. Did you notice anything like that in the [19]70s when you first started here?
SK: Well I think you have to separate who&#8217;s the actor. Students in the 1970s were much less likely, and still are today, to assume that you&#8217;re Dr. or Professor so-and-so and more likely in the South to call you &#8220;ma&#8217;am&#8221;, which really irritated me when I first ran into it and then I learned to accept it. So that occurred. I don&#8217;t see that among my colleagues in terms of asking me to get coffee. I don&#8217;t think they would have had the nerve. It&#8217;s much more subtle than that. It&#8217;s people coming by and assuming that you&#8217;ll be helpful to them. Even today, students are much more likely to stop by my office and ask me to let them in somewhere or where they can drop off a paper or whatever than they are my male colleagues. A lot of these things fundamentally have not changed. Window dressing has changed on that but fundamentally I think it&#8217;s the same.
JF: Sort of that when people are not thinking, just being impulsive, that&#8217;s when they reveal the most about what they think about.
SK: Or don&#8217;t think about.
JF: Or don&#8217;t think about.
JF: That when they&#8217;re on autopilot, and what they&#8217;re doing, in part, is placing a bet that a guy might brush them off and they assume that from a woman they might get a more positive response, I think, underneath it, you know.
JF: Or that you&#8217;ll be easier on grades or more sympathetic to sob stories about not getting done.
SK: Yeah, yes, some of that, yeah, and that sort of treating you as mother, and certainly that occurred when we were graduate students. I mean I still hear our graduate women complain about that.
JF: Was there any kind of women&#8217;s movement activity on campus? Do you remember?
SK: Sure.
JF: What kind of stuff was going on in the [19]70s?
SK: Well I came in 1970 and so before I got to campus I&#8217;d gotten a letter from a sociology student named Diane Crawley about forming a feminist coalition and they wanted to have a faculty sponsor. So she was involved in it&#8212;she went on to be an artist&#8212; [also] a graduate student in sociology, who went and got her Ph.D. at Penn State eventually, and some other students and some other players were involved in that, and the idea was to have some sort of feminist activity on campus. Also at the time a really, I think, important figure on campus was Gail Clay, who&#8217;s now deceased. She was the director of the university center and got that position, oh, I don&#8217;t know if it was in the 1950s or 1960s, because obviously I wasn&#8217;t here, but she was very supportive of doing things for women. She&#8217;d talk about how difficult it was as a single woman to buy a house because they didn&#8217;t want to give her a mortgage, and all this kind of stuff, so Gail Clay, a really important figure back there. So she&#8217;d have us over to her office in the university center and we&#8217;d talk about what we could do on campus, and so I came in the fall of 1970. This is the student&#8212;I got this out here for a couple of reasons for you&#8212;the issues committee, sort of the big speakers kind of thing, so we worked that first year on getting this program, and I have this poster still today because we were very offended by this particular poster in its depiction of the women&#8217;s movement, okay, so we sort of ripped these down. But the program was great.
JF: [Laughs] And for the record, may I take a picture of this after the interview?
SK: Oh, sure.
JF: I&#8217;ll take a digital picture and it will be with the interview. It&#8217;s a very&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know. How would you describe this woman, crotchety?
SK: Masculine.
JF: Manly, masculine, prominent jaw and chin bone, pushing a baby stroller with a bomb in it. [Laughs] But you got Betty Friedan to come speak?
SK: Oh, she was hysterical. She drank us under the table afterwards.
JF: [Laughs]
SK: I mean she was just as funny as she could be.
JF: And this is from 1971, February of 1971. The title is &#8220;Women: Motherhood to Militancy.&#8221; So there was some stuff going on.
SK: Yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to say. So people were doing various things. We got them to give us that program. In the 1970s, as I indicated to you, I guess it was in 1972, 1973 that Alvin Nielsen was dean of arts and sciences and he formed the ad hoc committee on women&#8217;s studies, of which I was appointed chair. That was a byproduct of something called the Task Force on Women, which I mentioned to you. So there was a Task Force on Women, and it&#8217;s one of the documents that is in the library and a lot of other places, that original Task Force on Women report, which proposed a variety of things, including creating women&#8217;s studies and you name the women&#8217;s issue, like women&#8217;s athletics and everything, and of course you have all the issues about Title IX coming in, so that document was really important and sort of what came next. Then the Commission for Women was the outgrowth of that task force also so a whole bunch of things on campus came about because of that original Task Force on Women. So then we recommended the formation of a women&#8217;s studies program, just a minor at that time, and that went through and then, you know, you started having the women&#8217;s athletics, and I had suggested that you talk to Gloria Ray, who was the first director of the women&#8217;s athletics, because that&#8217;s always an interesting kind of thing, that people assume that female athletes will be real advocates of women&#8217;s rights but actually they&#8217;re not. They&#8217;re sort of concerned about appearing feminine a lot of times. [Laughs] But Gloria was just a real go-getter and enthusiastic about supporting that program, so anyway. She&#8217;s with the Sports Corp&#8212;. I can&#8217;t remember the title of the outfit that she&#8217;s with in Knoxville.
JF: Yeah. I interviewed her yesterday at her office down there.
SK: Okay. Well she&#8217;s still the most energetic person in the world.
JF: Oh, for sure, yeah. You know I asked her if there were alliances between she and her fellow advocates for women&#8217;s athletics and then the women&#8217;s groups and she indicated that there was some anger from the women&#8217;s groups over the name &#8220;The Lady Vols&#8221; and over what they thought were concessions she was making to the male athletic department.
SK: Sure. Well people didn&#8217;t like the title, Lady Vols.
JF: What did you think of it?
SK: It wasn&#8217;t my personal issue but, you know, I don&#8217;t care for the Lady Kittens. It&#8217;s the Kentucky Wildcats and then they had the Lady Kittens, or something insane, so Lady Vols, I suppose, is not as bad as some of the others. But anyway, yeah, people were concerned about the concessions that were being made. I think everybody respected Gloria for being a real go-getter, but I mean she would do anything to get them, so, you know, if she had to kowtow, that&#8217;s okay. She&#8217;d do that. Because, you know, she&#8217;s a businesswoman. That&#8217;s how I see Gloria.
JF: That&#8217;s very much how she described herself.
SK: Okay. [Laughs] But that fit with women&#8217;s athletics, and the real fight that I saw much more was the fight between the old AAUW [American Association of University Women] women in the&#8212;. They changed the titles of these things but basically physical education, you know, where they recognized that if you adopted the &#8220;male model&#8221;, is what they called it, and I think that&#8217;s really what the fight was about. The Lady Vols was sort of a linguistic kind of thing but some of it was do you want to be like the men are, as corrupt as the men are, is basically what the question was, and will women&#8217;s athletics then be another sort of male bastion in the sense that you&#8217;d had women coaching women as long as it was not high prestige but if there was more money in it&#8212;and we can see what came to pass&#8212;that indeed in a lot of places that men indeed took the coaching positions and so on. There&#8217;s a women, who I believe is now deceased, Nancy Lay, who was in that fight here on campus, and I think there was some tension with Gloria on the AAUW, and you can certainly understand why there was that kind of thing, but I did want you to talk to her because I think you&#8217;ve got to round out your picture of what was going on. People in a lot of different ways pursue social change and you need all of them.
JF: And how did you see yourself fitting in? Would you have called yourself a feminist in the [19]70s?
SK: I&#8217;ve always called myself a feminist and I&#8217;m sorry that today that so many young women your age are unwilling to call themselves feminists. We&#8217;ll have graduate students and they say, well, you know, I don&#8217;t like to do that because people react to it. What do you suppose it&#8217;s all about? If you&#8217;ve ever read the history of feminism it was sort of created to be in your face.
JF: [Laughs] What do you think&#8212;? I ask people this and I know this isn&#8217;t like [one] answer [to this] kind of question, but what do you think feminism meant? What did it mean for you in the [19]70s and why do you think that term has gotten so banged up over the years?
SK: It&#8217;s something that I still try to study today. I got very involved&#8212;although my area is social psychology so basically while I&#8217;m interested in gender it&#8217;s not my research focus per se, except at times I focused on the movement polarization, the anti-ERA [Equal Rights Amendment], the Phyllis Schlaflys [founder of the Eagle Forum], all these kinds of people. A lot of what happens with movements is rhetorical. People positioning themselves, just like pro-life, anti-abortion, whatever you&#8217;re doing linguistically to sort of put yourself in a positive kind of position. That poster is an example of sort of that. Women&#8217;s lib, which is of course not what anyone called themselves. I mean they did say women&#8217;s liberation but they didn&#8217;t say women&#8217;s lib so much to describe themselves, which was easily transformed into people saying women&#8217;s lib and all kinds of stupid jokes that way. It&#8217;s not just feminism, is my number one point, that gets played in this way, that there&#8217;s an effort to sort of rhetorically or linguistically, whichever words you want to use, box people into corners, to redefine who they are by making them appear more radical or extreme or whatever. What I&#8217;ve been interested in and have been looking at is the Third Wave declaration, and I&#8217;m very suspicious that there really is something that recent that could be called a Third Wave. What&#8217;s that? And why is it that Sarah Palin, just as a representative of a whole category of persons, are using sort of male bashing [Laughs] as part of their game plan. And I keep thinking that for all the years that the feminist movement was sort of accused of male bashing to have the right wing talk about &#8220;put your man pants on&#8221; and &#8220;be a man.&#8221;
JF: [Laughs]
SK: That is what they&#8217;re [saying]. I&#8217;ve got reams of this stuff. So that terms get taken, that it&#8217;s hard to maintain control of them, it's hard to maintain control of images to this day. People will argue with you that there was bra-burning when there was not. I mean you can find students, anybody, and say, yes, there were bra burnings, and, no, there weren&#8217;t. Why is it that the images that get picked up in the media and get repeated over and over again take root in people&#8217;s minds? I&#8217;d love to find out the answer to that. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
SK: It&#8217;s the vividness of it, whatever, that just grabs their attention.
JF: So, trying to understand how feminism maybe played out particularly in the South, did it hurt the women&#8217;s movement in the South that these sort of vivid, radical, extremist images were the ones that got promoted and&#8212;?
SK: Promulgated?
JF: Promulgated.
SK: I don&#8217;t think so, because I think that while those of us on campus might have more often directly talked about feminism and used that word there were lots of people doing things that didn&#8217;t have the label &#8220;feminism" plastered on them, so certainly a lot of things dealing with, you know, people active in working with Appalachian women, the cooperatives and collectives and everything trying to sort of help them economically. There were a bunch of nuns who were very active in doing things. I don&#8217;t know that they particularly called themselves feminists or their activities feminist but they were caught up in part in the need to do something for women. So, no, I don&#8217;t really see it that way.
JF: Did you know of the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center? It started in [19]74 and then&#8212;.
SK: A very strange organization.
JF: Can you tell me about it? I&#8217;ve been hearing bits and pieces.
SK: No, not a whole lot, because what we fought for on campus&#8212;. You know we fought for a bunch of things on campus and we did get a women&#8217;s center in the university center, the women&#8217;s studies program, women&#8217;s athletics, you know, we were doing all those kinds of things on campus at that time. In the 1980s we were fighting for things like sexual harassment policy. The Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center didn&#8217;t seem clearly conceived. It sort of turned into a jobs training center as far as I could make out. It certainly wasn&#8217;t a place that people went to come together as women, and sort of unstable in terms of director and stuff.
JF: Yeah, I did remember reading that there was a lot of concern. They didn&#8217;t want to get pigeonholed as a pro-abortion group or any sort of&#8212;
SK: Right, then they sort of&#8212;
JF: &#8212;pro-something group.
SK: &#8212;ended up as a jobs training center, [Laughs] so I don&#8217;t know that that helped them. At various times there&#8217;ve been NOW chapters that sort of waxed and waned. There are some good people now doing stuff with the League of Women Voters. You&#8217;ve always had that outgrowth of the earlier woman&#8217;s movement, just the same as business and professional women, so those things are all floating around and at times they&#8217;re quite energized. Where I saw the movements tying together were like the Mountain Women Cooperative kind of thing and that would be supportive women interested in women&#8217;s issues and also interested in Appalachian population, or women would be involved in SOCM [Save Our Cumberland Mountains] or any of those other kinds of groups, but again not so much carrying a banner of feminism. I saw that as more the academic kind of thing.   Certainly there&#8217;d be events to try and promote the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and the 1980s. We certainly in various ways felt put upon by the behavior of the southern states [Laughs] with the Equal Rights Amendment. Our Southern Sociological Society, we wouldn&#8217;t meet in a state that hadn&#8217;t ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, and that certainly became difficult for a southern organization. [Laughs] Then you had Tennessee that sort of decided that they&#8217;d take both sides and passed it and rescinded it in a different session so it was unclear what&#8212;so anyway. That was when you saw some of that coming out, feeling that the feminist was being challenged.   Planned Parenthood keeps a reasonably low profile and doesn&#8217;t present itself as a feminist organization. Lorayne [Lester], who you&#8217;re going to talk to this afternoon, has been very active in Planned Parenthood all along. So I see different people getting involved in different pieces of the puzzle, some of it if they&#8217;re rooted more in the labor movement then they join up with women&#8217;s issues. Certainly Highlander Center&#8217;s gone through different phases depending on who&#8217;s the director, whether it&#8217;s more interested in women&#8217;s issues or not.
JF: But you couldn&#8217;t point to a woman&#8217;s movement the way you could point to a labor movement, you know, like there&#8217;s the union hall, there&#8217;s the labor movement people. The women&#8217;s movement seems like it was more dispersed and people moving in and out of places depending on&#8212;.
SK: Well, and I&#8217;m going to challenge your view of what a movement is. I think that it&#8217;s mistaken to think that a movement is represented by dues-paying membership or that there is a building somewhere that we can go to, that then gives you a sense of concreteness that I&#8217;m not sure really fits with at least my idea of what a movement is, which is people sort of more or less sharing some ideology wanting there to be change. It makes it much harder to identify my version of a movement. [Laughs] I mean in my view that there were lots of people doing different kinds of things with slightly different ideologies and all that contributed together to making some changes for the better, but could you find a spokesperson, no. Could you find a dues-paying kind of&#8212;no, but I&#8217;m not sure that that means there wasn&#8217;t a movement.
JF: No, I definitely agree that we should change the terms to fit what the situation was rather than try to make the situation fit the terms.
SK: Well I mean it&#8217;s like people periodically declaring that a movement&#8217;s dead. Okay. Can you tell me when it began? [Laughs] If you can tell me when it died tell me when it started. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
SK: And you see what I&#8217;m trying to say, that there&#8217;s an inherently ephemeral nature to social movements and we as academics can frame them for people and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to say, like about the Third Wave, is that I think that&#8217;s been framed by academics and the media, not really that there is a Third Wave.
JF: So the so-called Second Wave [Laughs] of the [19]70s?
SK: Oh, that drove me nuts.
JF: Yeah?
SK: Oh, it must have been in&#8212; [19]77? I&#8217;m not sure that was the right year. Over the years I keep giving away things to people who are writing papers or whatever about the past and then you eventually don&#8217;t have any more, but they don&#8217;t seem to keep them either. I mean because that was of course the original hope. Florence Howe, who had been president of MLA [Modern Language Association] and was involved with the Feminist Press and KNOW, Inc.&#8212;I&#8217;m sure you know those groups&#8212;had gotten grant money to look at women&#8217;s studies ten years later. So Florence was a real entrepreneur and one of the programs she looked at was at the University of Hawaii, and, I thought, ah ha, I&#8217;m not sure&#8212;. [Laughs] [I got] suspicious of her motives for Hawaii.
JF: [Laughs]
SK: And then she wanted a program in the Deep South, so when she called me, because I was chair of women&#8217;s studies then, I said, well, we&#8217;re not in what&#8217;s considered the Deep South, and we&#8217;re not a major either; we&#8217;re a minor. Well, no, no, I need a program in the South, and she was big on talk of the Second Wave, and I thought, well, okay, but where is the talk of the Second Wave coming from? In fact you&#8217;ve got that book No Permanent Waves&#8212;have you read that one?
JF: Nancy Hewitt&#8217;s?
SK: Yeah, I like that.
JF: Mm hmm.
SK: I mean I don&#8217;t care for the wave analogy. [Laughs] I&#8217;ve never tracked down who first started saying &#8220;Second Wave.&#8221; I remember things like&#8212;I mean there are events sometimes where you can pinpoint the kind of thing. I was in Chicago at the NOW [National Organization for Women] meeting in I guess it was 1970, [19]69, where Betty Friedan just sort of declared women&#8217;s strike day and people freaked [Laughs] because she just did it, you know, on her own. But other things, you know, just sort of creep into the vocabulary, have no precision, and what bothers me is they&#8217;re used to take minor distinctions and make them major so that if you read some of the people riding on the Third Wave they&#8217;ll suggest that prior to now nobody cared about race. Everybody in the Second Wave was ignorant about race. Maybe you should go back and read who was in the Second Wave and what they wrote and who they were before you proclaim that the Second Wave, whatever it might be, did not care about race.
JF: Right, that they were all white middle class women.
SK: Yeah. I mean every time I read that I keep thinking, so what classes did you sleep through?
JF: [Laughs]
SK: It just bothers my mind. I read these sweeping generalizations and then I&#8217;ve talked to some people and they say, you mean you're claiming that people talked about those things [Laughs] and I say, yeah, they did. Anyway.
JF: In fact I was going to ask what you thought of the relationship between movements in the [19]60s and [19]70s or that time period where there is so much social change and agitation going on, coming from the Civil Rights Movement, anti-war, the New Left, counterculture. Is it a coincidence or does it just seem that women&#8217;s issues kind of came to the forefront out of all of that milieu, or do you think that there was sort of a longer trend of women&#8217;s issues that grew along with those other movements?
SK: As a sociologist I&#8217;d have to argue that you had&#8212; a cultural environment, a medium, a cultural medium, if you will, for these things to grow in, related to post-war prosperity. You certainly see cracks in the 1950s, and the early 1960s still were pretty much an extension of the 1950s. But a couple of points, you know, which you sort of look back at them and you say, oh, that's kind of interesting, I wonder what would have happened if that hadn&#8217;t occurred. So Kennedy&#8217;s appointing women, that to me was a really important kind of thing, because then you had the states modeling it and then we had a task force on our campus and all these things sort of roll off of a model. Where that model comes from to begin with is always sort of tricky but at least there was the idea that you should have this group and certainly NOW [National Organization for Women] came out of his appointing that original set of women, so you keep saying, well, is this serendipity or was it the times, that something like that was going to occur; certainly a precipitating event. So you had that social-political climate in which there was an openness to that. You had baby boomers coming of age, I think, and I think that made a difference because you had all these sort of optimistic young people. You had various court decisions and legislative actions and executive orders that started pushing for equal pay, [Laughs] which still hasn&#8217;t exactly occurred. But certainly in a context where decisions were being made about changing longstanding racial arrangements and making it the law of the land that you would pay people in different kind&#8212;I mean I think those things all created this milieu.   My thing about women is that I have a model that&#8217;s much more like, there are always women who want to challenge the system that we&#8217;ve got, who recognize the inequities in it. How many women, how strongly [they] have these feelings changes over time. From my sort of grand model then is that when you have the conjunction of a bunch of other things then you&#8217;re going to have these visible movement activities. It&#8217;s not that women don&#8217;t care at other times or no women care; it&#8217;s just that the times aren&#8217;t ripe for there to be those kinds of actions. So I like to think that way because I&#8217;m not very comfortable with the idea that you go from being alert and aware to being unconscious. [Laughs]
JF: Or vice versa.
SK: Yeah, yeah. I mean the model is just bizarre to me where, &#8220;Oh, I woke up one day and realized that&#8230;,&#8221; and you think, I don&#8217;t think it happened like that. I mean I think that you might have had some awareness then you hear these things, see the possibility, and then you can pull more people into action, and you always still have a limited number of people really active. Then you have people active at different levels where they may be more involved, let&#8217;s say in the labor movement, but they see what the issues of women are. Or you can be more involved with women and see that we&#8217;ve got to support the labor movement. I think people vary in what their primary focus is, how they think you should proceed, what kind of actions you should engage in.   So the answer to your question is that in my model things were changing, we certainly know there were changes, and women going to college [but] not as many women graduating from college, but that had sort of turned around so you had then the idea that you could speak out, in my view which makes a difference for everybody. If some groups are speaking out then other groups feel free to speak out. I mean it&#8217;s no different in the classroom. If I get some of the students to talk other students will feel empowered and speak as long as I don&#8217;t let one dominate. So, yes, it&#8217;s facilitative that you had a student movement, that you had a civil rights movement, because that represented that there was the opportunity to speak out. Those groups had positive and negative sort of impact because they certainly challenged women from focusing on women, saying it&#8217;s more important that we do x, y, or z, and within those organizations that were in those movements you would find men who were very chauvinistic and obviously then you have the famous Stokely Carmichael quote: &#8220;The only position for women in SNCC is prone,&#8221; which feminists forever have loved him for that. Or, you know, the Weathermen, and all that kind of stuff. Anyway, that&#8217;s my answer; sort of complex.
JF: What were reactions like on campus in the [19]70s, like say to the creation of the women&#8217;s studies minor or to the report from the task force?
SK: Not a whole lot. I mean university students, not to paint them all with the same brush, I believe were more concerned before I arrived with getting rid of hours for women students [Laughs] than they were&#8212;.
JF: Like a curfew for&#8212;?
SK: Yeah, yeah, I mean in dormitories they used to have hours, so their issue in the 1960s was that students tend to be more concerned with having readily available birth control in the student health clinic and so on, so they certainly weren&#8217;t holding rallies, but people weren&#8217;t dumb and so there were people who did go and talk to the president about women&#8217;s issues, and you don&#8217;t have to have a thousand people. You just have to have some people who are articulate and know how to use the system, and there were those people.
JF: That sounds something similar to what Gloria Ray was saying. She said Title IX was a big deal but it was more like an ace in the back pocket and you would work the channels and find your allies and work with them rather than coming at your biggest obstacles, shoving your biggest weapon in their face.
SK: Yeah, I mean it would not be a good strategy here to do that kind of thing, and actually not a good strategy most anyplace. [Laughs] I mean because you would find people who would be supportive; now maybe not supportive of your whole agenda. That&#8217;s okay. You find who&#8217;s supportive of what parts of it, and that&#8217;s what I keep saying. You&#8217;ve got different people doing different kinds of things, speaking out on different issues, and you think, well that&#8217;s cool. If you want to go out and speak on that, great; that&#8217;s not what I want to do, but I&#8217;ll certainly spend my time doing this other thing. And then it comes together that you make some sort of difference, and that&#8217;s why I get bothered sometimes about models of movements too closely tied to organizations because I think they&#8217;re a combination of all these kinds of things. So I think, apropos of the athletic thing, is they had to do a lot of working around the president at the time. I mean we&#8217;ve had presidents of the university that were sort of conservative Baptists so they weren&#8217;t necessarily the most supportive of women&#8217;s issues, but again you don&#8217;t hit people head on. We had a chancellor, Jack Reese, for a long time and he was really quite supportive.
JF: I&#8217;ve also heard the name George Wheeler?
SK: Well he&#8217;s much more recent.
JF: Okay.
SK: Okay, yeah, George is much more recent. Jack Reese was when more of the action was occurring. George Wheeler made a difference in that he pushed for academic departments to really look for women, because I mean one of the tricks about why you do or do not have a faculty that sort of represents the discipline or the Ph.D.s in the discipline is complex but if you really try [Laughs] and there&#8217;s an institutional commitment you will do better than if there&#8217;s not that sort of real heavy push, and he would do that. We&#8217;d had for years, again coming out of that original task force, a salary study comparing women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s salaries. So a lot of these things, as I said, that&#8217;s a really key document with everything sort of flowing out of it, but of course it could have been a dead document if people didn&#8217;t take actions related to it. So, yeah, I mean I&#8217;d agree with Gloria that you work through the channels you knew, the people fundamentally you knew that you had [their support], like Chancellor Reese, in the 1970s for a lot of different things.
JF: How much of an effect did you feel Title IX had on the university?
SK: Well the state of Tennessee was Neanderthal and didn&#8217;t stop having half court women&#8217;s basketball until the 1970s when they were sued by a father and daughter in Oak Ridge, saying that it wouldn&#8217;t be possible for his daughter to play at the University of Tennessee as long as they kept playing half court basketball. So, yeah, Title IX certainly made a difference because the state of Tennessee obviously wasn&#8217;t in a mood to move forward.
JF: Actually I&#8217;m going to talk to Dorothy Stulberg. I think she was the one who represented that father and daughter. I had no idea that the basketball courts were half court for women.
SK: Well actually see I&#8217;ve talked to the people in phys ed. At one time they were a third of a court. I thought half court was bad enough but then somebody told me they divided them up even more than that before that. Yeah, so that was crazy. But on the other hand the women&#8217;s basketball, I mean the success of Pat Head Summit, I think, has really been helpful. I&#8217;m always interested in seeing the fans of women&#8217;s basketball. So anyway, yeah, we wouldn&#8217;t have had any of that.
JF: And what are the fans like? Is it mostly women supporting women&#8217;s basketball?
SK: Well, [Pause] yes. It&#8217;s more women but you can have&#8212;and certainly it appears both from appearance and other things that you have more lesbians than you would say gay men, maybe, at a men&#8217;s basketball game. I mean the proportion is&#8212;let&#8217;s just be frank about it. That&#8217;s the way it is. But you have retirees, a lot of retirees. People will come from Cross Hill and come to Lady Vol games, certainly retirees from the local area go there. I mean for some reason it&#8217;s very appealing to them. I can&#8217;t put my finger on that. I don&#8217;t think you get as much student following.
JF: How much has sexual harassment been an issue at the university?
SK: That&#8217;s been really tough. There were a couple things that we had to work on in a variety of ways. One of them was language, okay, so that one&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see. We did that through the Commission for Women, so the Commission for Women in that case, we proposed some language guidelines and we got Chancellor Reese to agree to append them to the faculty handbook, because we wanted to have some place that we could point to and say you need to use gender neutral language. I&#8217;m coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that&#8217;s probably dated in the 1980s, and again that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve got and that&#8217;s become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let&#8217;s say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we&#8217;re proposing this, so it&#8217;s coming from the side, if you will. Then you&#8217;d encounter all these people saying things like, &#8220;But that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That&#8217;s how I met my husband. You&#8217;re denying us the opportunity.&#8221; [Laughs] Well just keep your pants zipped up and wait a little while. It&#8217;ll work.
JF: [Laughs]
SK: But you can&#8217;t say those things. So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she&#8217;s been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I&#8217;ve been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it&#8217;s very weak. It&#8217;s a weak statement as it's written because that&#8217;s what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It&#8217;s better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn&#8217;t have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that&#8217;s one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It&#8217;s been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it&#8217;s rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues.
JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy?
SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That&#8217;s how I met my husband; that&#8217;s how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there&#8217;d be false accusation, that there&#8217;d be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don&#8217;t want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that&#8217;s the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution&#8217;s really at heart trying to protect itself and so they&#8217;re not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever. So, yeah, that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s not stronger policies.
JF: What about pay inequity between women and men?
SK: It&#8217;s there, you know. We've fought for years about how you measure it, how people are assigned different tasks. If somebody brought up George Wheeler&#8212;probably Anne Mayhew&#8212;one of the things that George did was try to push more in a mentor program, which I think has probably been really helpful for women, because what you had at one time was that women would get more advisees and get more of this and more of that, all the things that would sort of drain time away from doing other kinds of things, so that as over all institutions of higher education have cleaned up their act a bit about what is it you need to do to get a promotion, okay, which serves both men and women but the point is that as they clean that up I think it&#8217;s helped women particularly because you could lay this out early on in the game and point out some of the problems.
JF: So would you say that things have gotten better at UT overall?
SK: Better relative to what?
JF: Yeah, let me rephrase. What do you think has been the biggest accomplishment for promoting the advancement of women or gender equity on campus?
SK: What has promoted gender equity on campus? I really think it&#8217;s the gradual transformation of people, so that as people are socialized in a world in which they recognize what it means to have two working parents and responsibility for child care, and that that becomes sort of just taken for granted that we know that that&#8217;s an issue, you know, that we&#8217;ve been successful in the larger society, they bring that with them and that continues the transformation of the institution. Institutions aren&#8217;t static. They&#8217;re really people and so people come in and they bring new ideas and they take for granted things that other people didn&#8217;t take for granted and we keep moving along. So I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any point of radical transformation at UT, except I&#8217;d go back to the task force that really set a tone there, but since then it&#8217;s been gradual, sort of reflective of the larger society, in a southern context. [Laughs] And a southern context always means that people are more cautious about sort of declaring change. I have some apprehension that the current climate of everybody needs to be above average, every school needs to be in the top twenty-five, is not good for women. I suspect that any time that you put that kind of emphasis in there it&#8217;ll be a challenge to not have some skewing of what goes on. But we&#8217;ll see how that works out. But anyway, that&#8217;s one concern I have right now.
JF: Is there anything that you thought I would ask that I haven&#8217;t yet, or anything that you&#8217;d like to add?
SK: I think I should add that groups come and go, that you&#8217;ve got people for awhile who work together and then they sort of shift topic, that as I watch people around town that they might be more engaged with women&#8217;s issues for awhile and then engaged with other issues, but what you have for the most part are people are either active or not, okay, so that over a period of time I will run into persons I haven&#8217;t seen for awhile because we&#8217;re supporting some political candidate here or doing whatever and that&#8217;s just an interesting kind of thing. I think it gives you a different sense of things then saying being a feminist means from this day to this day your first priority is feminism and everybody defines you that way, and I don&#8217;t think it works that way. I think that fits really perhaps with your project, is instead of defining people in terms of a cause&#8212;.  [Interview ends abruptly because recorder stopped to back up memory]
