Joey Fink:  It&#8217;s August eleventh, 2010.  I&#8217;m in New Market, Tennessee, at the Highlander Center with Aisha Brown.  Aisha, the first question I said I would ask you would be if you would just tell me a little bit about your childhood, where you&#8217;re from, and what it was like when you were growing up, how you got to where you are today.  Aisha Brown:  I grew up in a rural African American neighborhood in west Knox County, and it was annexed into the city later on, so now the same place where I grew up in is part of Knoxville.  But it was very much the country in that people had chickens, and a lot of people had gardens, dogs, because in the country there&#8217;s not like leash laws.  But there are other people that can support the extended family structure.  There are other people that will tell your mother what you did or will spank you.  So, I grew up in that kind of neighborhood.  JF:  What year were you born?  AB:  I was born in 1951 in Knoxville, Tennessee.  Both of my parents lived in Alcoa, Tennessee, which was an aluminum company plant town.  And so, I think in 1951, later on after I was born, I think they started servicing African American families in their hospital.  So, my mother wanted me to be born in a hospital, so she was coming to a doctor in Knoxville, and that&#8217;s how I always say I&#8217;m from Alcoa, but I was born in Knoxville.  For me, I very much had like a working-class plant town background in my childhood, and then relatives in the country, so I had the rural piece.  And I even had relatives that lived in the area where my great-grandparents lived, so they were actually in a part of - far east, east Knox County that was called Sunrise at the time, but it&#8217;s about twenty miles east of East Towne.  The mall is on that side of town.  So, that was another rural area that we got to visit when we were children, and we could see the different houses and shacks.  Somebody would say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the house your mother was born in,&#8221; or, &#8220;That&#8217;s the house your grandparents went to when they got married,&#8221; that kind of stuff.  Even now, if you go to Sunrise to the graveyard, I can see a lot of my ancestors and relatives on both sides laid to rest in the graveyard that&#8217;s out near Sunrise.  I say all that to say I am from East Tennessee.  I&#8217;m Cherokee on my mother&#8217;s side, all the way back through the women.  And my mother has passed away, but her mother was 101 years old.  And I knew my maternal grandmother&#8217;s mother.  She lived to be 93, so when I was a teenager I knew her.  And she was raised in Blount County by her father, her Native American father.  And so, we can kind of trace our family tree back to the mountains in the earlier generations.  So, I really consider myself a mountain woman, and I am from East Tennessee, and there&#8217;s a special thing that I get from nature, from the lakes and the river and the mountains, the Smoky Mountains, and the things that are around that are just naturally beautiful.  I really get a kick out of the fact that I am the one person in my family that stayed in this area and that I stayed in the South.  And it was kind of an active decision for me, because people in my family are in Chicago, New York, DC area.  JF:  How many siblings do you have?  AB:  I have two siblings, a sister and a brother, and they&#8217;re both older than me.  They migrated like Chicago, Chicago area.  Well, my brother did come back South.  He&#8217;s in Middleton, Tennessee, now.  But I very much like the beauty of East Tennessee.  And I think a part of my connection to nature is - partly what kept me is my rural piece.  It&#8217;s the part that has, I think, kept me attached to Tennessee as a physical place, to live and work and still think about things.  And I&#8217;m conscious that politically it&#8217;s still the South and there&#8217;s still a lot of work to do, but I like remembering those parts in nature that are beautiful.  My father&#8217;s parents came here from Georgia I imagine to see about work that was going on at Alcoa.  But they were farmers and very talented horticulturists, so where everybody else bought a house, like people who worked at the plant could buy a small wood house and a lot, my father&#8217;s parents bought their small wood house and then they bought lots around their property.  So, they were actually some of the few people in the African American community of Alcoa that actually had - they still had a farm.  And so, you know, it might have been even like a couple of acres.  They bought enough lots for it to be like maybe an acre and a half or a couple of acres. But they had a fishpond.  They built a cobblestone patio.  Even though they kept their basic country wood house, they brought rocks down from the mountains and built a patio, and a stairway, and the fishpond.  They recycled.    I think right now I&#8217;m just giving this background as the kind of people that nurtured me when I was a kid.  Things that I saw that I just took second-nature were the things that I saw - these people now would be considered environmentalists, you know, that inspired me, and agricultural experts.  And I think that they were on the order of that: agriculturally, of a George Washington Carver or something.  Their laboratory was their community and the lots that they bought.  They didn&#8217;t have a university, but they did incredibly with what they did have.  My father&#8217;s mother had about a fourth grade education, yet she landscaped her yard with bushes and things she brought down from the Smokies that people said, &#8220;Well, that won&#8217;t grow down here,&#8221; or &#8220;You can&#8217;t do this,&#8221; or &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;  And she just landscaped her whole property with beautiful shrubberies and trees.  It would have been on the Dogwood Trail had she lived during this time period.  And she started a 4-H Club for young African American - I assume it was probably teenagers.  She started a 4-H Club in Blount County for young African American girls.  And they often said that she was - she was a very tall woman.  She wasn&#8217;t like overweight, but she was big, they would say.  Her name was Beulah.  They would say, &#8220;Beulah was a big woman.&#8221;  I named an art gallery after her later.  In the early [19]90s when I had a little shop for a while, I named it after her.  It was called Beulah&#8217;s Eye.  That was because she also had this creative edge: she tatted and made lace and sculpted, played the organ and piano for her church, and she helped to build the foundation for her church.  And she also went to a different church than her husband.  My father&#8217;s father was a minister, and he was an assistant minister at a Baptist Church.  And she went to that church for a while, but she was actually one of the people that left with another minister to build his own church.  So, I think, when I think about her and my other grandmother, I think those were the early feminists that I was exposed to.  JF:  Uh-huh!  AB:  It was very, very obvious and clear.  And they said that maybe there was a time when she even worked in the aluminum company, that she may have been one of the women that had a job there.  She was about five eleven and a half.  She wore about a size eleven shoe, but she would wear boots.  She worked in her garden, so she would wear like men&#8217;s boots or something while she worked.  And she would also cook food, sell dinners, spaghetti dinners, to raise money for her church.  So, she was also one of those people that had something going on Saturdays out of her kitchen.  People would come there.  People used to say that they don&#8217;t think that Beulah went to the back of the bus either.  People always say that.  Well, we know there was a political back-of-the-bus that was the most powerful because it catapulted everybody into the most incredible fight for justice probably in the history of the world, the recent world.  Everybody always said, &#8220;Well, yeah, there was other people that did it, and this is the one that was the organizer.&#8221;  Rosa Parks was organized and part of a greater plan, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s always good about organizing.  But, yeah, people say they don&#8217;t think that Beulah would ever go to the back of a bus, and they don&#8217;t think that anybody would ask her or expect her to.  My mother&#8217;s mother was almost the opposite of that.  She was very petite, physically opposite.  But she went an African Methodist church, so one of the churches that I would go to when I visited my maternal grandmother, which I spent more time with her than I did Beulah, the other grandmother I described.  And she was a part of a flower club and she was also good at horticulture, but her thing was houseplants.  So, very early on, I was interested in agriculture and I was interested in recycling.  I was just raised in a place where people contributed to their community.  So, my other grandmother would be one of the ladies that would organize the teas for the fundraisers, and the little girls got to pour tea, and people would give you money, and the flower club would organize fundraisers, and they would donate.  But they were very - her and her friends were very well dressed, very particular, and very - met for tea.  So, I really learned to like tea from my maternal grandmother.  And my maternal grandmother worked inside the home.  So, the other part, I think, of my family&#8217;s background, which comes deeply from both my grandmothers, is - the one that was petite that was the homemaker, she was actually more fierce.  She didn&#8217;t necessarily use her [fierceness] outside in the community in a radical way, but one-on-one, she was the person that showed me that you don&#8217;t have to allow people to mess with you at all.  So, I think, very young - even in a place like east Tennessee that has a small percentage of African American population, I think early on, somehow in the way that I was raised, I never thought that I would ever tolerate anything inappropriate: injustice and a lot of the different things that we&#8217;re dealing with as far as gender issues or criminal justice system or economic justice.  All those things are people really trying to do abusive, oppressive things to other people.  And so, one-on-one with my maternal grandmother, whether it was shopping or going to the grocery store, people didn&#8217;t disrespect you, you know, in the checkout lane, or any kind of little innuendo because you&#8217;re black, that actually - if it happened when I was a child, it wasn&#8217;t tolerated.  My mother migrated to New York, of course, because she wanted better job opportunities and more things to do, as she would often say, &#8220;than just cleaning up after somebody,&#8221; or doing some manual labor.  So, she migrated to New York and was able to pursue her interests and careers.  And my extended family - I was raised by an aunt that was my maternal grandmother&#8217;s sister.  And that&#8217;s the experience that I had in west Knox County that was rural and outdoors, with a garden in the backyard.  That influence was very powerful, too, because my uncle, he did the garden seasonally.  He hunted.  He fished.  He worked at the aluminum company, too, but he also went to the lake.  He had bought maybe twenty or thirty aluminum boats, and so during the summer he rented boats to people at the boat dock so they could go out and row or - I think some of them might have had a small motor on them.  But he rented boats, little boats to people to go out and fish or go out on Sunday, rowing or something, and that was his business during the summer.  He would work night shift all summer at the aluminum company and he would do the boats.  And he had a concession stand there near the boat dock.  I got to go with him, so I learned to fish.  And there was a swimming pool that was - really the place that he had his business was considered an African American park at the time because it was still segregation.  But there was an African American coach that would run the swimming pool during the summer for Parks and Recreation, and that&#8217;s where I learned to swim.  I could almost swim like a fish from the time that I was four.  And there was also a swimming pool close to my grandmother&#8217;s house in Alcoa.  My brother, he was like a lifeguard, because we just grew up going to both swimming pools constantly, nonstop.  I grew up feeling really confident.  My father was a World War II veteran, and he suffered complete disability, posttraumatic stress disorder.  And he was - in high school his nickname in high school was &#8220;Philosopher.&#8221;  So, when my father was in high school, people thought that he was very, very smart.  I think the war really cut off a lot of opportunities for him and experiences that I know he was really set up to have intellectually.  And the reason I say that was he ended up with other siblings - Beulah had about ten children, and at least five of her children had college degrees, graduate degrees.  One of my uncles has a Ph.D., I think, and two of my aunts have master&#8217;s degrees in English.  And my Uncle Fred had a master&#8217;s degree, I think, in English.  He was the first African American person to teach in a public school in the state of Tennessee.  I think that was Oak Ridge, was where he got the job.  His name was Fred Brown.  He had a very academic background.  And there was another brother they had in education, another brother they had that was a male nurse in the [19]50s, and then I had two aunts that had graduate degrees.  So, my father had - at least half of his siblings were academic, and he was a writer.  He would write all the time, even though you couldn&#8217;t necessarily always make sense of his journaling - he journaled.  He had stacks and stacks of notebooks. You could tell his interests were in theology and world religion.  You could tell what he thought about, even though the war had really messed up his mind.  I think when I was coming of age in east Tennessee, I had all these indicators.  I had things to make me feel really, really strong and positive about myself.  And then, I had these really strong women around me that actually didn&#8217;t hesitate at all to do or say whatever it was that they felt like they had to do.  And then, the aunt that raised me, she was a caterer, so she had her own business.  So, I really also grew up around the whole activity of feeding the family, of nurturing and health and nutrition.  It was always tomatoes and beans in the garden, and people canned and put away food for the winter, so they could have their own fresh vegetables. I remember that.  People grew corn and beans and went fishing.  I think my uncle hunted a lot.  There was like a photograph of me and a deer.  There was a deer tied to the car that had lost his life.  And somebody must have told me to stand over there and get a picture, and I was just like hanging on to the front of that car like, &#8220;Oh, my God, they killed him!&#8221;  [Laughter] I must have been about ten or something, or eleven, but you could tell that I was just like, &#8220;This is not so good.&#8221;  [Laughter] I kind of look sick, like, &#8220;Please get me out of here.&#8221;  But I don&#8217;t think I ever ate that deer.  I didn&#8217;t want to taste it.  But that was the rural.  That was the ruralness of the situation.  You&#8217;d go hunting, and you would have pheasant and quail and all these different kinds of trout and things that would come from the fish line, because he would lay a fish line in the river and then just go back and pull it up, so it would be all these different kinds of trout and catfish and spoonbill or turtle.  I grew up where people would fix the regular catering dishes, but they also would do turtle soup or bring home fresh venison or have some trout that was just straight out of - back then the water was not so bad, so you could eat trout out of the Tennessee River, and it was okay.  [Laughing] Maybe not so much anymore.  So, I think that it was really good for me and influential for me that I was raised by hunter-gatherer agricultural geniuses that kind of laid this image for me of what things could be like, even in simple terms, when you&#8217;re just happy with your family and this is what you do to provide for your family.  JF:  Do you think it was unusual for your family, especially the women in your family, to have such independence and strong wills and confidence?  AB:  I think that, for some reason - and I do think that there was something special about both my families, and I could see even back then there were different ways that women compromised or negotiated, so I could see that they were powerful and that they were moving forward, but you could also see the matriarchy and then you could see how the patriarchy controls the matriarchy.  [Laughs] So, it&#8217;s not like powerful women weren&#8217;t there, but in the end bell hooks says something about you can see - even in those subtle nuances, you can see who the king was in that family structure.  And I think this piece of history is very important for me because I knew my father, my father knew his father, both my grandfathers knew their fathers.  I know where my great- and great-great grandfathers are buried, and I may know where my great-grandmother is buried, I think.  And so, for me, this history, this linking of family structure, you can see that women negotiated some levels of power, but you also know that they functioned inside this greater system.  And my grandmother would talk about it, my maternal grandmother.  She would say, &#8220;Well, y&#8217;all don&#8217;t have to take the things we took.  You don&#8217;t have to tolerate that.  We don&#8217;t have to do that anymore.&#8221;  She was quick to remind people, even though somebody is married for fifty years, it don&#8217;t necessarily mean all that.  There&#8217;s still that piece of the women&#8217;s struggle I think that people discuss inside the life of a domestic engineer.  And my maternal grandmother never worked outside her home.  She raised my mom and three other children, and she helped raise a lot of grandchildren.  But I think she was quick to determine what it meant for her to have a high school diploma, which she did, as opposed to somebody else going further and taking it further.  So, she was always pushing us to do other things.  And there were a lot of generations.  On her side, she had a brother that had started a school in North Carolina for African Americans who were hearing and sight impaired.  It was a state school, but he started the first one and he ran it for years.  And then, of course, segregation ended or supposedly ended, and they didn&#8217;t have a need for a race-specific school of that nature.  But he started it, so there were people in my family even in my grandparents&#8217; generation that went to college.  So, I think the push was really heavy, especially since my siblings were baby-boomers, too, I think the push to do something was always really big in my family.  I think that staying in the South in a small southern town has probably affected to a certain extent how much movement success you could actually measure, say in comparison to someone who did something really, really big.  Like, we&#8217;re here at Highlander, and we know people have been through here that have done really, really huge, incredibly big things in relationship to civil rights or justice.  But, by the same token, on a local level I think there are a lot of things that you can pursue that take a really long time, and there might be inches of progress forward and still not be so-called &#8220;wins,&#8221; as people determine something big happening, a law being passed, or something being changed completely.  So, it&#8217;s almost like - sometimes seems like maintenance.  You know, if you&#8217;ve lived long enough to watch different politicians and different systems, in and out, you&#8217;re kind of just like maintaining a systematic way of trying to challenge another system.  And so, there&#8217;s so much going on that you really have to manage input in a way: How much time and attention can I actually devote to this part of my activism as opposed to something else?  And so, I ended up being drawn to culture because I really felt that culture had a powerful thing to do, especially with media, television, movies, and music, and the way that people are affected by culture and storytelling.  I felt like culture was the biggest issue in terms of helping people to discuss and try to relate to how they were thinking about change, first changing themselves, then reaching out into the community or into the movement and contributing to a wider thing.  Because if you don&#8217;t realize you need to change, then it&#8217;s probably a limited realization in terms of how society needs to change, or how organizations need to change, how social justice approaches need to change, and how communities and governments need to change.  It covers all these systems and all these things you really have to know and learn in order to even challenge these systems.  It&#8217;s kind of not a job.  It becomes like an ongoing thing that you do, keeping up with information, keeping up with the reading, keeping up with what&#8217;s being said on a particular issue or concern you might be working on, but also trying to have a broader sense of what&#8217;s going on everywhere and how that affects everybody.  Like, now, all of a sudden, the whole country is just green.  It&#8217;s like everybody just folded in a couple of minutes.  It was like, &#8220;Oh, everybody&#8217;s recycling!&#8221;  [Laughter] That&#8217;s culture.  And so, I&#8217;m very interested in that.  Like, why does it happen that way?  But also I&#8217;m interested in how it happens, again, in a good way or for a higher purpose or for an even better cause.  JF:  Where were you educated?  Tell me a little bit about your educational experiences.  AB:  Hopefully, I&#8217;m still being educated.  JF:  [Laughs] That&#8217;s a good point.  AB:  I&#8217;ve had a fun experience.  In 1969 I attended Hampton University and I kind of continued some of my thoughts from high school, like my interests were in psychology, and I had an interest in debate in high school, so in college I pursued rhetoric and debate and speech and psychology.  Because of the posttraumatic stress disorder of my father as a veteran, I was always interested in psychology in high school.  So, I kind of started there, and I didn&#8217;t go to Hampton for very long.  I only attended Hampton for a year.  I came back to Knoxville and I attended Knoxville College for about a year and a half.  And there were times that I have worked at the University of Tennessee and taken courses, and there is a time when I have also just enrolled in school at the University of Tennessee.  And I lived in Nashville for a couple of years in the late [19]70s and I attended school at Tennessee State.  So, I have a really balanced liberal arts kind of - I have a reader&#8217;s education, I suppose.  And I am a writer and a poet, and so, I do believe I have a poet&#8217;s education, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I have twenty-some hours in psychology, I have twenty-some hours in world religion, I have twenty-some hours in agriculture, which was an interest that I carried over from my childhood, and I think I have the experience time in sociology.  I have some sociology courses, but I have a lot of background that affords me, I think, almost like probably my undergraduate degree is in sociology just by experience in jobs and the kinds of things that I&#8217;ve been doing for the last twenty years.  I think what I&#8217;ve been doing would come close to sociology and cultural anthropology, if I could frame it in any way.  I keep planning to add another piece to that, hopefully without having to deal with the undergraduate part of it.  I&#8217;m working on writing programs that accept you on your writing strength, as opposed to worrying about your transcripts.  I&#8217;m trying to get in a writing program because I can write and forego having to go back to graduate school for another semester of documented something, attendance or something.  But, yeah, I went to four schools.  So, I got in this mind of reading and writing, and I think I&#8217;m just getting to the point where I have time for that and I really like it.  So, right now, I&#8217;m focused on my writing a lot, and it&#8217;s taken some time for me to be able to do that, but it&#8217;s good.  JF:  Aisha, I&#8217;m going to pause for just a second to skip to the next track.  [Recording stops at 34:15 and starts again at 35:10]  JF:  Do you want to start back at 1970 at Knoxville College, and maybe we&#8217;ll work our way from there?  What did you like about Knoxville College and what didn&#8217;t you like about it?  AB:  [Laughs] That&#8217;s interesting.  I think, for me, being in college when I was eighteen, nineteen was a time where I could have learned more about being focused, and so I think that I just wanted to know about a lot of different things.  And I really was concerned, because of the time period more so than anything and the history and the culture, I was really concerned about what was going on in society, and I couldn&#8217;t really see how what I was doing academically had to do with the real world at the time.  So, I think that had to do with going to the different schools and kind of jumping around.  I got married and had a baby.  I just kind of left school in [19]72 and was more interested in doing something else.  And I think a lot of words from the time period, the late [19]60s, early [19]70s&#8230; I think that I was kind of a cultural warrior.  I considered myself a spiritual warrior, and I realize now I was really a cultural revolutionary.  And I had specific things in the culture that I wanted to challenge and I experimented, I think, a lot with shifting cultural barriers and challenging things that had to do specifically with how people thought or how people learned.  JF:  Can you give me an example?  AB:  My daughter was born in 1973, and I had a sense then, I believe, that the form of education that I was pursuing and the way that I was pursuing it wasn&#8217;t very effective for me.  Like, now, forty years later, people can write their own academic programs, and there are different things that you can do inside a university, inside a residential setting, to still allow yourself some expanded ideas about learning inside that system.  I think, for me, since it was the time period in American history where people my age were challenging the system, that I felt a lot like education was one of those systems that I wanted to see adjusted.  So, when my daughter was born in 1973, I really just began to read a lot of John [Caldwell] Holt, Ivan Illich.  I studied the Marie Montessori system just because she was able to do something in education with children that were supposed to have learning disabilities and challenges.  She was able to help them surpass the other children in that Italian school system that she was familiar with.  And so, she then asked herself the question, &#8220;Well, if this works for them, what would it do for everybody?&#8221;  But that was a very formal system even inside itself.  I always dug deeper because, of course, Montessori was for those who could afford it, and when I was working sometime I would send my daughter to Montessori School.  But I was very interested in home schooling and I was very interested in new ways of eating, diet, and nutrition.  I was interested in herbs and growing herbs and things that had to do, again, with basic survival, but looking for better ways to advent internal change.  What if you eat differently?  What if you think differently?  How do people go about learning to think differently?  My daughter went to public school for about a week, and I struggled with - in preschool she had gone to Montessori and gone to some free schools, which were just kind of schools that ran on new ideas and new learning methods and were usually fun, too.  If the word "free" was involved, they were also fun schools.  In preschool I had sent her to Montessori and some free schools, but the public school situation, after a week, I just felt strange about it.  I didn&#8217;t like the way it was treating my child, so I embarked on an experience of learning inside, home schooling. Not just the different ways that people do that, but very much rooted in about ten John [Caldwell] Holt books that I just read over and over again.  Instead of Education, How Children Learn, and How Children Fail were the top three that I would just read all the time. Instead of Education and then there was one that was kind of like Learn by Doing.  The idea was when people really found what they were interested in, then your kids would begin to pursue that.  But until they found what they were really interested in, bullying them about it wasn&#8217;t actually going to help their life any.  My daughter, I would say in retrospect, she had a lot of fun.  I wasn&#8217;t very attached to workbooks and I wasn't very attached to trying to pretend to be a regular school.  We went to a lot of art galleries.  We went to the mountains a lot.  Home schooling was a lot of fun, a lot of fieldtrips, a lot of - maybe not so much movies back then, but lots of museums, lots of outdoor activities, lots of trips to the mountains, walking in the Smokies or hanging out by some of the smaller rivers in the mountains.  I ended up chartering a school, because home schooling was not legal in the state of Tennessee when I was doing it.  It&#8217;s legal now.  And so, I chartered a school and occasionally I had to deal with various visits from people from different administrative departments that managed the public school education system, because they did have to show effort for dealing with truancy and dealing with different things.    My daughter&#8217;s childhood I think - I hope - for her was a lot of fun, and, also, it was an experience of where, when there was school that got close to her being able to go to, she went to an alternative high school when she was almost twelve.  She was eleven at the time, eleven and a half, when she went there.  And because she went there, the school began to examine having junior high and high school. After that, they did go ahead and occasionally accept another student inside their system.  Back then, &#8220;alternative&#8221; didn&#8217;t mean the kids that go to the school have a problem.  The public school systems and the government co-opted words just - the same way they do in terms like &#8220;community organizing&#8221; now, they did twenty years ago to the word &#8220;alternative schools.&#8221;  Alternative schools used to be kind of an extension of free schools. Summer Hill, or places where people could learn consensus building, learn to collaborate, pursue different art forms in high school, have a photography darkroom, and different things inside smaller schools or smaller numbers.  My daughter went to Laurel High School when she was about eleven and a half, and she was admitted in a print and drawing competition that was exhibited at this gallery that&#8217;s not around anymore.  It was called the Dulin [Gallery].  And the Dulin would have an annual high school print and drawing competition.  Laurel High School entered along with the city high schools.  If there were about a thousand pieces of art, they picked about three hundred to exhibit, and my eleven-and-a-half-year-old daughter had a piece in that high school competition.  In retrospect, I didn&#8217;t think about it until much later, or even recently, in the last couple of years, but home schooling very much was a part of my radical step forward in womanist power in terms of me being able to take a stand about my child.  I knew other home school mothers, but it wasn&#8217;t like we were trying to promote this as an issue or get other people to do it.  We did support each other.  I did have friends who did home schooling that would do childcare for me or teach my daughter something, and we would make exchanges like that.  For me, it was very much a part of, like, alternative economy, alternative education, alternative community, which is all about culture to me in the end.  And my beginnings as a culture worker and a cultural organizer, I think, was just first dealing with those internal family structures that were so important to me as a child.  Food, clothing, shelter, what goes into your mind and your spirit - how is that going to be nurtured?  What are we going to be eating?  JF:  Who were the other women that you were informally sort of allied with in the home schooling?  Were they women you knew from your neighborhood or from organizations or old friends?  AB:  I think that it was very few people, and I think that people that do that maybe end up kind of finding each other.  Maybe it&#8217;s just that you go to the same waterhole or something.  [Laughs] But I had one friend - she&#8217;s a raw food caterer - I have one friend that I&#8217;ve had a really long time, since the [19]80s.  And she made the tofu and the soymilk, and now she does raw food catering and she&#8217;s a farmer in Alabama.  Interestingly enough for east Tennessee, not a lot of east Tennessee women that I knew were doing these kinds of things.  Later on, I met a few, not a lot of African American people, but my friend that&#8217;s a raw food caterer from Alabama, she [pause] - I&#8217;m very reluctant to use words to describe people.  This is a total tangent for me.  I just realized I was trying to describe my friend inside this conversation, and it&#8217;s just that she&#8217;s my friend.  You know?  JF:  Um-hmm.  AB:  And I met her - a guy I was dating introduced me to her, but I think it was because he thought that we had similarities.  She had two little girls and was getting ready to have her second son when I met her.  If you have to go to Alabama, she might be one of the people that you would like to talk to.  She had eight children and she was always interested in food - sustainability and food science and farming - and now she&#8217;s down in Alabama trying to get a farm together.  I would say that we practiced home schooling, and the similarities that I had with her were more about justice, power, liberation, culture.  She was Rastafarian. The whole idea of cultural liberation meant a lot of things, but especially how you looked, how you ate, how you taught your children. She was very much a home schooling friend.  In other communities that I was in, like Nashville, it was, I think, maybe a spiritual circle or a religious community that kind of focused on trade and exchange and different things.  A lot of those people ended up going ahead and sending their kids to school later on, too.  I think, for me, it was very much I didn&#8217;t have a lot of support.  My family didn&#8217;t think it was a very good idea.  They would kind of aggressively discuss it with me from time to time.  So it wasn&#8217;t a very popular thing to do, and since it wasn&#8217;t legal, it was just kind of like a little bit of a challenge.  Of course, you were being a little bit of a rebel, but you had to make sure you didn&#8217;t have your child out in the daytime before school closed, because people are used to not seeing children before two and three o&#8217;clock.  And back then somebody would always mention it: &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you in school?&#8221;  It was like a favorite question.  JF:  So, when you said you chartered a school, was that sort of just to fulfill a legal formality so that you could school your daughter, or did you have other kids -?  AB:  So people could leave me alone, mostly.  I never really just opened a school or had other people.    I worked in education, like I worked in a community-based summer program called Martin Luther King Institute.  And the guy that founded that, George Kemp, he would rent inside churches, and one time we had the Institute in public housing.  But in the Institute, I taught arts and crafts.  There was another time I was on the Board of Directors.  And so, I think my interest in children also extended into these other areas.  It was like my daughter was ten, but sometimes I would work in the Institute, and then they started a daycare.  Sometime I would be on the board; sometime I would work in the daycare.  But I was trying to pursue this idea of alternative education in a lot of different ways, and this was more, I think, about mentoring and tutoring and after school programs so kids would have somewhere to go during the summer.  The director, we called him Brother [Hariff 52:48], George [Kemp 52:49], he was a retired public school principal and assistant principal.  He worked in education anyway, and then this was what he did when he came home after hours, what he did in his community.  So I helped on that.  I thought about it a lot, and I went back and forth about it a lot when my family challenged me, just wanting to make sure she got certain things and certain skills.  It wasn&#8217;t until later in life - because my daughter, when she graduated from high school, she went to UT, the University of Tennessee, a couple of times and then just dropped out.  It was like a couple of different semesters.  Later on down the road, maybe she was about twenty-eight, she started taking courses, taking some more dance classes, and then she started taking art classes.  She graduated from the University of Tennessee in 2005.  She was around thirty-two when she graduated from college.  And I realized then, and that&#8217;s like much later, some of these ideas in John Holt, I could see them kicking in, because I could finally see her doing what she really wanted to do.  And so, a lot of times I&#8217;m just known to say, &#8220;John Holt was really right,&#8221; because a lot of things do come together when people are happy and doing what they really want to do.  I always look at her and go, &#8220;John Holt was right,&#8221; because she graduated College Scholars, she wrote her own program in media art, cultural studies, and cross-cultural collaboration, and she did several cross-cultural collaborations before she graduated from the University of Tennessee as an example of her own program that she wrote.  But, going into that, I don&#8217;t even know if she was sure or realized that she had the oomph to graduate with honors, one of those, as my mama used to say, &#8220;Laudie-laudies,&#8221; the second one - I can&#8217;t ever remember what it is - magna cum laude.  She graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee in something that she loves, and she&#8217;s able to use it, she&#8217;s able to discuss it even here at Highlander in the context of activism and social justice.  One of my friends in New York said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate the fact that you home schooled a child that graduated a Scholar.  Don&#8217;t underestimate what you did.&#8221;  JF:  Yeah.  AB:  And so, I can truthfully say that that was my [19]70s thing that I think was really radical, and it was really in the South at a time when there weren&#8217;t a lot of people willing to even defy such a system as public education, because even now they&#8217;ll put you in jail if your child don&#8217;t go to school, if they feel like it.  You know, if that&#8217;s one of their excuses they want to use, they can use that one, because some laws - Bush passed some laws before he left that had to do with truancy.  But now, you can legally home school.  It&#8217;s just you have to register and test and still fall in the lines with certain systemic ways of educating the child.  Now it&#8217;s under control, so to speak, or under wraps.  But I think that was kind of my personal cultural revolution, and then I was able to translate that into cultural work that I could do in the community or I could do with people or with other artists or just even with ideas.  I think in my mind I&#8217;m developing as a culture worker.  I&#8217;ve had this opportunity to do that at places like working at the Highlander Center in the early [19]90s, and then in the [19]80s I worked in the library, and I was also an administrative assistant to the cultural program that Jane Sapp created at Highlander.  And so, I was in touch with other Southern - I think this was around [19]83.  JF:  What was the program?  Jane - what was her last name?  AB:  It was Highlander&#8217;s cultural program, but it was Jane Sapp.  Her husband was Hubert Sapp.  He was the first black director that Highlander had, and I think he came around [19]82.  She had a cultural program here, and I was the administrative person on that project.  I began to contact and communicate with other people who were doing cultural work around the South.  JF:  How did you first get introduced to or hooked up with Highlander people?  AB:  I think primarily from the publicity around the fiftieth anniversary in 1982.  I think, because there was a lot of publicity around who would be performing at the Bijou, because they had an event at the Bijou Theater, and one of the performers - of course, a lot of people that had been affiliated with Highlander and a lot of the Southern activists that had been also involved with music and cultural work were performing at the Bijou.  And a friend of mine - we went over there, and it was sold out, but I think we got to hear part of it standing up, and Sweet Honey in the Rock was there.  During that weekend, I met people that were attending other events.  Another friend of mine that lives here is from Chicago - I rode up here with him.  And I just kind of was very curious about what was going on or how people could get a job.  Somebody told me when something came open in the library.  Then I did that for a while in the [19]80s.  But again, most significantly, I think - the important thing that I was able to do was also that my daughter attended some of the programs that were up here for young people.  And also, in that engagement, she was able to get involved with community projects, with African dance, and she got involved with the intergenerational theater project with Carpetbag Theater, she got involved with a peer theater group Planned Parenthood had when she was young.  I think a lot of that - she says a lot of that confidence came from her participating in youth program workshops at Highlander.  So, it&#8217;s had a kind of a positive experience on me as far as me learning more about popular education.  And I think that I could say working in the youth program in the early [19]90s, I became a really good facilitator while I was working here.  And I&#8217;m able to use that in my own work and use that in situations of all kinds.  Just being able to help people sit down and listen to each other and talk is a very powerful thing.  I think popular education is just one of the extensions of my life, having this education piece run through it, whether it&#8217;s cultural education or home schooling or popular education, those things being about activism, but just also my family background.  Even without a college degree - because I went to all these different schools and studied all these different subjects, but I could pull that together and create something that is very interesting as far as my activism.  All that stuff has helped me be the activist that I want to be.  So, I&#8217;m able to use my education, even if it&#8217;s not in the specific way of having an academic degree in a particular subject.  I think that getting exposed to popular education at Highlander has helped me look at ways that I can use that in my community and just still trying to be as community-centered as I can be and also write, take the time to do the writing and other things that I want to do.  I&#8217;ve been a part of local groups, but I&#8217;ve also been a part of trying to help local groups.  JF:  Did you work with TERN?  I read an article about you that you worked with TERN.  AB:  I worked with the Tennessee Economic Renewal Network, first on the Board of Directors.  And I&#8217;m trying to think of a timeline, but it might have been around 2003 that I got involved with TERN, because somebody I knew went to a World Social Forum, and I ended up being one of the people that helped them raise money so they could pay back some of the money from the people that helped them go.  I kind of indirectly got involved then and was just going to Fair Trade meetings and trying to learn more about some of the things as far as how international trade affects people economically here, that I had started learning about at Highlander when I was working at Highlander in the [19]90s.  And I think TERN was started up here sometime in the early [19]90s, too, but I wasn&#8217;t so involved with it then, because that was the economic program that would have been involved with them, and I was in the youth program.  So, I was aware of it on the periphery, and then I always say I got sucked in.  And then, some kind of way, I just started going to more meetings, then somebody asked me to be on the Board of Directors, and that&#8217;s one time I can safely say I probably should have said &#8220;No,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t.  [Laughter]  From there, I end up being on a board for a couple of years, then doing some consulting work, trying to manage some directors coming in and out, so I was Interim Director for a while.  I don&#8217;t know what article you read, but when I stopped working on that, which was kind of abruptly, I broke my foot.  This has been about 2006.  I fell and broke my foot, and the building that the office was in was not wheelchair accessible, and it was stairways, and the crutches didn&#8217;t work.  So, I ended up trying to do some stuff from home, but, really, I just had to shut it down.  I didn&#8217;t walk well, even with a cane or a stick or something, for a really long time.  I broke my ankle really bad.  So, suddenly I wasn&#8217;t involved, but when I was involved, I&#8217;d say, as Interim Director, the greatest thing that I felt like we were working on was with Gerdau Ameristeel, which is the downtown recycled metal facility that is on the edge of this community called Lonsdale.  You might as well say it&#8217;s in Lonsdale.  And it&#8217;s had a lot to do with the railroad track coming through there and buying up additional property and expansion and air pollution, particularly downtown, and one of the key things that affect air quality in that area that is Mechanicsville and Lonsdale, which is primarily African American people, low-income European American people, and recent Latino residents.  We got started on challenging the air quality permits, so that was the most exciting thing that I was doing when I was working there, because everything else was about management and organizational development and - I don&#8217;t know a nice way to put it - and me trying to figure out how to deal with things that other people did that were just really confusing.  I think it was kind of on the end or transition of an organization that I came in on that group, so not one of my favorite stories [laughs], because I think organizational development-wise, I think, as activists, we might get bogged down structurally in things that have to do with the making of a business.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a skill set that everybody has.  You&#8217;re trying to work on movement issues, but you&#8217;re trying to manage a business, too.  I kind of walked into this organization when all that, coupled with a male-dominated environment having set themselves up to confront three African American female employees that came together to look at their own injustices that were being met upon them inside such a power structure.  So, I kind of walked into that, like [laughing] you walk up in the middle of some serious feminist activity, I must say.  [Laughter] It&#8217;s just no telling what will happen.  TERN was making a transition from industrial renewal to economic renewal and trying to figure out what that meant to people.  Knowing that this economic environmental thing was getting ready to cross - so how to make that transition.  Because I could see the sustainability stuff coming in and I could see the environmental stuff coming in, but it was hard to get everybody on the same page by the time that hit.  And it just hit overnight.  We had a new president, and the next thing you know everybody is green.  [Laughing] I mean, it&#8217;s just still - it&#8217;s quite a miracle.  It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, wow, what&#8217;s going to happen next?  A big oil spill.&#8221;  I worked with TERN and I learned a lot about what I don&#8217;t know, about people, about nonprofit management, about the transition of an organization, like when to let go.  Because some things, if you didn&#8217;t create them, you&#8217;re not going to be able to fix them either.  It&#8217;s not yours.  You come in thinking maybe you can offer some contribution or do something to help, but in the end, if people don&#8217;t want help, you can&#8217;t really help.  I think TERN was an organization that did a lot of great things early on with workers and I think it was hard to pinpoint in transition what was the next step of that, because I participated in - there was a national organization that TERN was a member of that took a great many grassroots people to the World Social Forums that were held in Puerto Legro, Brazil, more than once and also Mumbai, India.  But the idea was to expose people to as much about world economic issues and as much about fair trade and what trade was having to do with the transformation of the global economy.  I was able to participate as a member in some of those trips.  I attended the World Social Forum in Mumbai, India, and I attended one in Puerto Legro, Brazil, and I did learn a lot about other things that were going on in other parts of the world.  And so, part of my experience at TERN, again back to education, [was] learning more about what&#8217;s going on in the world.  And I think that was one of the programs that they did that was extremely effective: to just educate workers and also to help workers see what was going on on the border in Mexico and what was actually happening to Mexican workers.  I think all that stuff was important, so no matter what I did to either support that happening or participate in it, it was really good for me.  Some of the experiences that I had with that organization were very good and helped me a lot.  And I think the part where I&#8217;m trying to manage a nonprofit organization that might be in a little crisis or might be having a few things going on that really are about organizational development.  At the time I thought that I was kind of good at organizational development stuff and I had helped groups, like smaller groups, but I wasn&#8217;t able to help this group at all [laughs] and I probably contributed to some of the problems.  But I have been a part of other organizations like that where the leadership is either male-dominated or just under male domination, you know, could actually be females in the leadership that don&#8217;t know that they still function inside a patriarchal structure.  It&#8217;s hard to say that that is a problem because it&#8217;s not a problem for the males that get to be like alpha all over the project and stuff.  [Laughter] It&#8217;s not a problem for them, so they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;  [Laughter] It&#8217;s just, you know, &#8220;Women!&#8221;  [Laughter] So, I think that those are still situations inside organizations and inside organizational cultures that I don&#8217;t feel people actually feel comfortable about addressing.  JF:  Do you think it&#8217;s easier to address those kinds of things doing cultural work?  AB:  I think some of my strong points of experience have been to suggest things inside organizations that are not culturally specific to the reining power structure.  So, interestingly enough, part of my activism in the South, I think, has been that I have tended to be the type of cultural revolutionary that challenges the status quo even if it is inside an activist structure, which is the greatest shift.  It&#8217;s the greatest change that you could possibly make because, of course, &#8220;We&#8217;re changing the world!  What do you mean?&#8221;  You know?  &#8220;What do you mean I&#8217;m racist?&#8221;  [Laughter] It&#8217;s the next question, you know, although I don&#8217;t think calling people racist is the way to accomplish anything, just the general idea of it, that there might be organizational culture, there might be something going on inside a structure that needs to shift a little bit or change.  So, I feel like, as a cultural worker, I&#8217;ve been able to address - it&#8217;s been a little easier for me because I was a writer, I was a poet.  I don&#8217;t actually sing.  There&#8217;s a lot of comfort that comes with songs.  I think the cultural workers that make music and help people sing, they are the most fun.  They are the culture workers that people want to hang out with.  [Laughter] They do not want to hang out with the smart-mouthed poet -  [laughing] you know what I&#8217;m saying - that&#8217;s talking about shifting the organizational culture.  [Laughter] No, no, no!  I think there are little things that I am happy about that I participated in that I will never be famous for, that no one will ever know or care.  It&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh, you did that?  So what?&#8221;  You know?  It wouldn&#8217;t be like that big of a deal, but it&#8217;s a big deal to me.  And one is that I was coordinating a Youth Citizenship School - I think it was in [19]93 or something - and they were people that were eighteen to twenty-five, so they were young adults and were kind of like already established in some of their projects and community issues.  I was working with a person that had been working in the youth program and directing things for four or five years before I came on.  I was able to enter into discussion with a group of people that thought it might be unusual if couples participated, as opposed to, say, the man is admitted into the workshop and the family gets to come to Highlander because the man is admitted to the workshop.  I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;Well, if they do their community work together, how about admitting both of them into the workshop?&#8221;  So, then it&#8217;s like the discussion about the budget for childcare or whatever.  So the next thing I know, there are two couples participating, one from Ohio and one from east Tennessee.  We have two married couples in participation and nursing mothers that don&#8217;t want to put their children in childcare.  For the first time, we actually have parents and we have children sitting in the middle of the circle.  For me, that was very exciting.  And it&#8217;s almost twenty years ago now, but just this idea of shifting the habits or the points that people are attached to culturally, like, &#8220;This is the way we do this,&#8221; or &#8220;This is where childcare is, and you can go get your child when the workshop is over.&#8221;  It&#8217;s just a little tiny shift, but it&#8217;s the most exciting stuff to me.  Twenty years ago, we were engaging ways to have youth program participants come back to Highlander and participate.  My daughter was one of four people that helped create a summer youth workshop.  They had been in it three or four years earlier, and now they&#8217;re creating one and they&#8217;re the team and they&#8217;re the coordinators, and we&#8217;re the support staff.  We&#8217;re bringing people back that have done it.  They&#8217;re finding out they&#8217;re good facilitators and they&#8217;re still community-minded and community-focused, and we&#8217;re taking these other steps of saying, &#8220;Well, look at the age set.  Look at the age group that works here.&#8221;  Just in the last twenty years, there&#8217;s a shift in the age set of who&#8217;s running the show of a major social justice institution.  There&#8217;s a shift in people of color participation and people being able to - staying power - people being able to continue to a certain level, as opposed to &#8220;last one hired, first one fired.&#8221;  So, there are things I think that are important that are happening inside social justice organizations on top of the fact that some of the laws that are just recently passed.  People are experimenting with insurance, providing insurance for employees, providing adequate vacation days so you don&#8217;t work the daylights out of your employees, providing considerations about health or fitness or medical care.  A lot of those things come out of democratic process or come out of social justice institutions, then into the greater society.  It just doesn&#8217;t happen overnight.  People talk about it for thirty years or forty years, and then - and that certainly affects women and children, because right now, with the job situation and the economy situation, people just haven&#8217;t been getting medical care at all.  There are so many things that are cultural, not specifically in my issue, but things in the culture that have to shift, that some people are angry about now, but that&#8217;s too bad.  The culture has to change.  I think it&#8217;s been a challenge for me to be the kind of culture worker I am and to be thinking the way that I&#8217;m thinking about what we need to change inside ourselves while we&#8217;re changing the greater society.  It still gives me things to work on, in terms of perspective.  I still have things I need to study up on and approach and figure out new angles and ways to jump back in there and get things done, because I think the movement is changing quickly as society changes. I don&#8217;t know if we have a clue about what it&#8217;s going to be, even in the next couple of years.  We don&#8217;t have a clue what&#8217;s going to happen next.  It&#8217;s all kind of shifting quickly.  I think being a culture worker just helps me to be observant and to keep my ear to the ground and watch the signs and see if I can notice or help to notice what&#8217;s the next shift and what&#8217;s our next bend and sway going to be.  JF:  How have your ideas about gender equality changed over the past thirty years?  AB:  [Pause] That seems to be a hard question [laughing] for me to answer, because I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve changed very much.  I don&#8217;t know if my ideas about gender equality have changed very much over the last thirty or forty years, simply because, as far as race and culture and gender and even class, even though I see there have been little changes, I don&#8217;t think there have been enough changes that we&#8217;re at a level yet that - we can&#8217;t jump up and scream yet and we cannot gloat yet.  [Sighs] I wish I could say I&#8217;m very impressed with the way society has changed and that, even with me being around in the time when we have the United States of America&#8217;s first African American president, I can truthfully say I don&#8217;t really know what any of this actually really means.  I&#8217;m still in research mode.  I&#8217;m still in observation mode because I think whatever happens next is going to be very interesting, too.  [Laughing] You know?  JF:  Have there been alliances over the years that have surprised you or that have worked really well, alliances between groups of people or alliances between groups working on different issues that come together on common group to effect really meaningful change, whether it&#8217;s small day-to-day stuff of the nitty-gritty life or whether it&#8217;s changes in the city you&#8217;ve seen or neighborhoods?  AB:  [Pause] I think that deep down inside I feel that unfortunately there&#8217;s not enough change that has occurred in America or in the South to be of a significant enough level for me to acknowledge.  I feel very positive about my life and I feel very positive about the future, but I also see the history that I have lived.  And I think the hardest thing is to be a certain age and know what you&#8217;ve actually seen and have that kind of be a barometer for any future evolution.  What does it exactly mean?  I feel a lot like when you look at the statistics as far as education, African American health, obesity, medical care, infant mortality - when you look at some of these statistics and you look at the South, the South is still, in a lot of ways, on the bottom of a lot of these lists.  So, it does make me go, &#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s going on?  What are we doing?  What&#8217;s really happening?  What&#8217;s really changing?&#8221;  Right now, I&#8217;m just in a mode right now of still trying to do some research or some observation.  I don&#8217;t really know what the next step is movement-wise.  And I am concerned - the reason I&#8217;m interested in personal research is I&#8217;m interested in not like reinventing the wheel, wasting my time doing something that doesn&#8217;t have merit or that I&#8217;m not going to be able to see something positive and productive from.  This idea of, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re in this for the long haul,&#8221; you know, I&#8217;m not interested in any misery at this point.  And so, I think, for me, I have come to a point where enjoying my life is more important than being the person to carry the last flag up the hill.  [Laughter] &#8220;Oh, I got it!  I got it, I got it!&#8221;  You know?  I think there are a few things that may never change, although I do also think scientifically the world is changing faster than the speed of light every moment as we sit here.  I think the actual change and transformation that sometimes is occurring is the change that we aren&#8217;t giving attention to.  And I think there&#8217;s something right now going on in the world with the world religions, and then there&#8217;s something going on with the superpowers and the money.  There&#8217;s something going on that&#8217;s going to shift who has the strongest economy.  There are some things that are happening, I think, that are going to determine even what&#8217;s the next language that people are going to worry about.  Some people are still worried about Spanish.  And I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But, yo, baby, how is your Chinese?&#8221;  [Laughter] Because Spanish ain&#8217;t getting ready to be your only problem.  You know what I&#8217;m saying?  I think sometimes people can&#8217;t catch up with themselves.  They&#8217;re like all in a tizzy, but they're not acknowledging actually how fast the world is spinning on its axis.  We&#8217;re in motion, and I think that, just as something as complex as physics or the atoms splitting, I think in some way as thinking, breathing human beings, we have to come in sync to that kind of vibration, that sound vibration.  So, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re actually acknowledging the level that we need to acknowledge right now, in terms of how fast things are happening.  I&#8217;m trying to be very careful and cautious about the way that I work now.  I think what is different now in terms of gender, race and class, because I think that it&#8217;s hard for me as a person of color to map out what is specifically ranking in oppression, because I&#8217;ve had people try to argue with me about whether, &#8220;You&#8217;ve had it harder being a woman than you&#8217;ll ever have being black,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a white person trying to tell you that.  And you&#8217;re like, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;  [Laughs] And so, rather than rank oppression, I could just say that so far I don&#8217;t think people are going to quit.  There&#8217;s a level of gender, race and class that people just need to back off of that&#8217;s related to their ignorance, but they don&#8217;t seem to actually be willing to do that.  So, there&#8217;s a whole lot of mayhem.  Right now, I&#8217;m just a little bit upset about how much women are going through in terms of these wars and just the fallout from the natural disasters.  A lot of times you&#8217;re talking about jobs and how people are doing, but women are really suffering in the aftermath of the hurricane in Haiti and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The things that women and children have to go through in the world just in terms of who&#8217;s on the bottom of the list in relation to hunger.  Who&#8217;s hungry?  Who&#8217;s unemployed the most?  Who&#8217;s not getting medical care?  Who&#8217;s getting laughed at in Haiti when they&#8217;re reporting being raped in the camp that they have to live in because they&#8217;ve lost their homes?  Who&#8217;s at the brunt end of the police laughing and not responding and not doing something to help them?  It&#8217;s women and children.  I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s enough progress, even if there is progress.  I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s at the level of an advanced society.  And I think there may be societies in history that have probably just not recorded that they did better than people are doing now on some of those issues.  Because there may be more - even women&#8217;s leadership of nations and governments, heads of state - there may be more women in history than there actually are now that are coming about in different parliaments and different governments.  I feel, as far as gender, race, culture, there&#8217;s still a long ways to go before people realize the level of oppression that&#8217;s been vented upon different groups of people for different reasons.  And I think that if you&#8217;re a woman of color, it&#8217;s just overlapping into different arenas in different ways, you know, in the job market in a different way, and the prejudices and the stereotypes are all different.  And there are not enough hours in a day, but I think people still need to be communicating and talking about it and working on that in a participatory way so that we&#8217;re all working on those personal changes, those changes that are going to have to shift in individuals before they shift collectively in society.  I think, for me, most of the groups, if I actually worked in community groups - in the [19]70s, the two or three that I can think of that I went to meetings and volunteered and helped and participated, the power structure inside those organizations was male, just like I feel like basically it was in Tennessee in TERN.  Even though there were females employed and females involved in leadership, I think specifically there&#8217;s a culture, there&#8217;s a subtext, there&#8217;s a substructure, and if you look at it really closely, in a lot of groups it comes out to be male.  Lucky for Highlander, that&#8217;s not the case.  For Highlander, leadership has evolved over the years, and so in its beginnings it was male, but the last couple of directors have not been.  I think there&#8217;s been that thing happening inside organizations in the South where people have had female leadership and have had women running foundations and running organizations or helping community groups and distributing money, because women have always been an active part of the movement, civil rights, social justice.  I agree that people separated movements and separated into categories that kind of shut down communication in different ways, because people were like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go over here and work on this issue, and this is more of my concern.&#8221;  And I think there&#8217;s still that discussion that movement people have to have about women&#8217;s rights organizations in history, having that history where they tend to pull off to the side and go, &#8220;Well, we can get this passed if we&#8217;re not hanging out with those black people.&#8221; That happened after the Civil Rights Movement.  It happened when women won the right to vote.  And so, I figure it&#8217;s this issue of overlapping groups of allies needing to step forward.  There&#8217;s an incredible thing happening this weekend as far as a protest around a Nazi group coming to Knoxville that&#8217;s organizing around immigrant rights.  And it&#8217;s a primary group of European American allies that are organizing the counter protest to this basically white supremacist march.  I think that it&#8217;s a very good education opportunity for the community that sometimes wants to know, &#8220;Why are white people leading this protest, and not the NAACP?&#8221;  You know?  And I think that&#8217;s a good question to get answered for a lot of the European American people in the community, to be able to talk to those students and those activists that are participating in that so that they can say why white people should be actively engaged and speaking out about some of these issues.  And certainly when it involves racism and people just want to actively throw a certain group of people out of the country, it&#8217;s going too far.  So, for me, it&#8217;s constantly - [sound drops out at 97:18 and begins again at 98:13 when recorder shuts down temporarily to back up memory].  So, there are a lot of things, to me, that are still similar that we still have to work on, even though it might not be about not going to the back of the bus.  It seems like in some ways it should be more advanced, the country still should be more advanced than it is, in terms of some of the problems that we&#8217;re still dealing with in the society.  [Recording stops at 98:51 and resumes at 99:44]  Joey Fink:  We&#8217;re back after a short break, and Amira Haqq, Aisha&#8217;s daughter, has joined us.  Amira and Aisha, if you would just like to talk a little bit about - Amira, maybe you could give your perspective a little bit on some of the things your mom has shared with us about being home schooled in the [19]70s and being part of this cultural world that involved these Highlander folks and activists and artists, and we&#8217;ll go from there and see where it takes us.  Amira Haqq:  I just have to say most of the time I&#8217;m in denial about it.  [Laughs] It&#8217;s like so much a part of me, but I sort of try to exist as if I&#8217;m sort of separated from it in a way.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s just sort of my way of trying not to have any - you know sometimes you meet people who are kind of like second-generation certain types of environments, and they kind of boast it?  [Laughs] But I don&#8217;t really - I&#8217;m very proud of it, but I think that I - if anything, it comes out through my art, like what I&#8217;m into, so I&#8217;m really quiet about it usually.  But when I was younger, she noticed right away, when I was probably about three years old, that I was into drawing and sculpture.  So, I think by the time I was six, I was lucky enough to have a mother to just get me all the paints that I needed and stuff, so I could decide that actually I preferred water color and acrylic to oils.  The oils just weren&#8217;t drying fast enough for me!  [Laughter] It&#8217;s kind of like I&#8217;m making this thing, and now it&#8217;s like taking this long to dry, and I need to move on.  I need to stick it up on the wall and move on to the next thing.  So, a few friends of mine were like, &#8220;Your mom actually gave you oils?  Like, paints?  Who does that?&#8221;  [Laughs] Like you wouldn&#8217;t give a six-year-old child oil paints?  But I was able to decide very early on what my interests were because she did that.  JF:  When you were being home schooled, did you know that it was actually illegal for your mom to be doing this?  AH:  [Laughs] Well, I remember that there was a period of time when she got a charter, and I was the only student at the school that she got a charter for.  So, I knew that there were some issues about it, because there were at times concerns about where she was taking me when we would go on our field trips and stuff.  She was a little bit concerned that someone would see us out and question her about why wasn&#8217;t I in school.  I think sometimes people would ask me, and I was like, &#8220;I am in school.  What are you talking about?&#8221;  [Laughter]  And some of the times during those experiences I would go to Montessori schools for a little bit, so she always had me in activities or some social activities.  So, depending on what was going on with us economically at the time, or what area we were living in, I didn&#8217;t always go for the full school year.  So, there might be a little bit of home schooling and then Montessori for about a few months and then some home schooling.  But there were periods of time when we did stay in the house a little bit more than usual sometimes, depending on what was going on.  So, yeah, I was aware of it.  And then, at some point she got the charter, so then we were a legal school.  I told someone at one point, &#8220;My mom had a charter school.&#8221;  And they were like, &#8220;Well, why on earth did she do that?&#8221;  And I was like, &#8220;Well, home schooling wasn&#8217;t always legal in Tennessee.  [Laughs] So, she wanted to figure out how to have me at home with her and do it in a way that we wouldn't have to worry so much about it.&#8221;  So, it was definitely a move.  AB:  The other thing that I can think of that was fun about that to me was that she could stay up as late as she wanted to.  She could sleep later, or she could get up early if she wanted to and go back to sleep.  And so, suddenly the learning wasn&#8217;t on the clock of the daily nine-to-five clock.  The learning was just happening whenever she felt like going to do whatever it is she was going to do.  So, if it was checking out the plants and the grass and bugs, then that was learning.  Or if she was painting, she could paint as long as she wanted to.  I think that being able to stay up all night and those things have to do with allowing a child freedom, when there&#8217;s not a rule for everything.  Then suddenly it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I can paint or play with my friends.&#8221;  I told you about my other friend, [Yahwah 105:00].  For a while, she was across the street, so she could be across the street with her little girlfriends playing dolls at three o&#8217;clock in the morning.  So, we kind of left some more space in there for play and learning while you&#8217;re playing and just being free.  AH:  And it was unusual.  Some of my friends always kind of thought it was, I think, a little weird.  And then sometimes, I guess maybe sometimes I felt like, &#8220;Well, do they know something I don&#8217;t know?&#8221;  And then, there were always situations where I knew things that they didn&#8217;t know.  So, sometimes I would have some of my friends be like, &#8220;Oh, your mom actually tells you about this, this, and this.&#8221;  She probably focused on stuff, especially as far as history was concerned, especially as far as history was concerned.  A lot of my other friends just had no idea of different things regarding things that were going on in the world and history.  So, it was always really interesting how folks would react to me.  I think I&#8217;ve always had a tough skin because I had to get one really quick, because it wasn&#8217;t always easy how other children would react to me.  There were outlets and times where I was able to meet other children that were in similar situations.  However, the bulk of it was a bunch of kids wondering why I was weird, and why did I dress funny, and being an African American young girl that my mom chose not to straighten my hair or put a relaxer in my hair.  There was always kind of like - it sort of made me an activist without me really even trying to be, just because she made some choices, so I had to make decisions about whether or not I agreed with it and if I could defend it or not.  And most of the time I did, even though it was hard at times, especially with folks thinking you look funny.  When you think about a whole society of people that don&#8217;t even know what their hair would really look like if it wasn&#8217;t relaxed, and how they&#8217;re reacting to someone who&#8217;s doing the opposite of that, and how they&#8217;re taught to think about someone who&#8217;s doing the opposite that.  So, it was a lot of little battles with other children, and somehow I was able to get through it.  [Laughs]  It&#8217;s not for everybody.  I had some other friends who grew up in an environment like that, and as soon as they got old enough, they stepped as far away from - [laughing] &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to break open some canned pork and just do the complete opposite of everything.&#8221;  I&#8217;m still close to those folks.  They&#8217;re still like my brothers and sisters, but it&#8217;s just like the few of us that were, especially in Knoxville, there were just a few of us, and it was rough.  So, there were a few folks, as soon as they got to that age where they felt like they could just break out of that without too much judgment from their families, they just went on the opposite end of it completely.  AB:  Trade their dreadlocks in for a wig!  [Laughter] No more of this being different stuff for me!  Yeah, that is funny.  JF:  Was it just the two of you pretty much?  AH:  Most of the time.  AB:  Yeah.  I think that was the part of my feminist - I think my feminist experience stepping forward is more personal, and it's not totally involved with my movement stuff, so I really haven&#8217;t talked about that part of my life, which had to do with husbands and just individually stepping forward as a human being and saying, &#8220;Okay, I can&#8217;t take this.  [Laughs] I can&#8217;t have that in my life.  I can&#8217;t have this in my life.&#8221;  And so, I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s a whole other interview.&#8221;  Because a lot of that is about, again, patriarchal values, religion, ideas about what men and women are supposed to do that are not just Judeo-Christian values, but Islamic values as well, that are kind of out there in society, that have dictates about women.  I&#8217;ve had an evolutionary process seeking my spiritual identity.  And I think part of a rebellion that I had towards the way maybe that men treated me personally had to do with at least me trying to set enough of an example for my daughter to, &#8220;Well, at least I can get out of this even if I allowed myself to be in it.&#8221;  At least she can see me leaving as the last thing that she remembers about it.  I&#8217;ve had to, I think, because of the way that I was raised, I ended up feeling really strong, even sometimes when maybe men in my life or different people didn&#8217;t think I should be strong.  I knew I had a right to not send my child to public school.  I knew I had to right to walk into a Montessori school and ask them if they had scholarships, to ask people what arrangements are you making to include people of color in this high academic experience.  And, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to know and I&#8217;d like to use those resources if they&#8217;re available,&#8221; or people would get busy and create ways that you could participate.  I didn&#8217;t have a limited way of thinking about myself and I didn&#8217;t want my daughter to think in a limited way, which sometimes backfires, because I feel like I really taught her to be a fighter, and it&#8217;s not always a good thing I have learned [laughing] the hard way, myself, personally.  Sometimes you can just kind of let this one calm down or let this one go or let this one do that, but sometimes you have to adjust.  But I think because we are in the South, that particular thing that I feel like I did get from both my grandmothers that served her well, I can see it in my granddaughter.  Surely, she will not be taking anything off of anybody.  So, it still comes back to family, I think, which is very important, and makes me very happy that she joined the conversation, because I feel like I got that from Annie Kelly and Beulah Brown and the other people in my family.  I wasn&#8217;t around the 4H Club, but just hearing about it totally inspires me.  And the aunt and uncle that I lived with, they - my uncle had the Boy Scouts.  The black Boy Scouts met in my backyard.  The Neighborhood Association met there sometimes.  People did drive people to vote.  That aunt and uncle were kind of like grandparents to her, so she saw them being in business.  She saw them driving people to vote.  She saw them going to the neighborhood meetings.  So, by nature, it was a family or a community experience, by nature.  I was always linked to a community, even when I was working at some place like Highlander.  I still had my own neighborhood land trust or neighborhood group that was working on something that we needed to work on that I think came from that family identity.  It&#8217;s really important to me, too, to hear what she thinks, but I think I had to bring out my quiet personal feminist in my personal experiences, and that&#8217;s a whole other long story, to tell the truth.  AH:  Well, one thing I was going to say is that the whole thing about seeing - not feeling like you&#8217;re stuck in a situation, I guess, was a part of my life to begin with, because when she did attempt to take me to public school, I think I was going into first grade.  But I think that I probably was really at a second grade level when I went into it, and they were having a hard time with the type of schooling she was saying that I had gone through beforehand, so they wouldn&#8217;t test me.  So, they put me in a first grade class.  And the woman is giving these pages out for us to circle the smiling fish [laughter].  I circled the smiling fish, and then I colored the ones who weren&#8217;t smiling some sort of green stripes with purple polka dots, and then I colored the smiling fish orange.  And I got a big &#8220;wrong&#8221; mark on my paper, even though I had done what she had asked.  It was the fact that I had done a little more that was the problem.  So, I think I was there for two weeks, and it was like a really tortuous situation for me, and I went to her regarding it.  She was asking me how I felt, and I said I hated it and I didn&#8217;t want to go back again.  [Laughing] And so, I never had to go back to public school again.  I think I kind of knew that I didn&#8217;t have to be going through that.  But a lot of people that I&#8217;m friends with felt like that they didn&#8217;t have any other choice in the matter.  It&#8217;s what they had to do, and so that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve done.  And it&#8217;s made them who they are, and some of them are great people.  But, yeah, at six years old, I just was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m supposed to be treated like this.&#8221;  The woman would never try to pronounce my name correctly, my teacher, and I always thought she was making really ridiculous requests of the children in the classroom.  I thought to myself, &#8220;Are we really like this - like, are we this dumb?  Did she really just say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t do this with the chair,&#8217; and put the chair on her head?  Like, are there really people doing that?&#8221;  [Laughter] Because she would give us this list of things to not do, and it would be things that I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone do yet.  And I was just kind of like - she was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do this with the chair,&#8221; and she sticks it up on her head.  And I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Okay.  Really?  Are we really doing that?  Are we sticking the chair up on our heads?  Did I miss something?&#8221;  Of course, then people are like, &#8220;Oh, you can do that to a chair?&#8221;  [Laughter]  JF:  [Laughing] The power of suggestion!  AB:  Then they start doing it.  AH:  Then they start doing it and they&#8217;re getting in trouble for sticking the chair on their heads when they probably wouldn&#8217;t have thought of it to begin with.  But it was just really - yeah, it was really kind of interesting going through that experience, and I&#8217;ll never forget it.  But I think that probably really early on I was just kind of like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to go through certain things.&#8221;  And so, that was good, I think, in the long run.  It took me a while to know.  I don&#8217;t think I knew until my early twenties that it was okay that I had that experience.  I think it took me a long time to be okay with having that experience.  Of course, I&#8217;ve picked something to do that probably I would not have picked to do if I had stayed in that type of school situation.  AB:  It&#8217;s worth it.  AH:  Yeah, because I&#8217;m struggling with trying to be this independent female filmmaker.  I&#8217;m continuously being reminded in various ways of what people&#8217;s problems are with me [laughing] trying to be a female filmmaker.  Initially, when I got into it, I didn&#8217;t realize it was like that big a deal, what I was attempting to do, until I started doing it.  And then it was like, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s really not that many of us.  And I&#8217;m coming out of a program at the University of Tennessee that&#8217;s actually a pretty good program, and out of the thirty women that I remember being in school with, me and two other people are the only ones that are actually still doing it.&#8221;  Because once they started trying, the no&#8217;s and the hands are up and they&#8217;re looking at them - they just started doing something else.  They went back to school for something else or just started doing something else.  It&#8217;s been kind of interesting.  I didn&#8217;t know, probably until I was coming out of the program, what I was going to get into.  I think that probably my early experiences have been a big help, because I think otherwise I probably would have done something more similar to what a lot of my peers that I went to school with did, which was pick something else.  AB:  So, you could have the freedom to do something challenging if you really have been raised to feel like you can face a challenge and you can overcome a challenge.  And so, personally, especially in the South, this would be a financial challenge for her just employment-wise, and to be able to focus on that means that you don&#8217;t necessarily have another job.  That is your main job and that&#8217;s what you focus on, and you focus on securing relationships that keep that evolving in a positive way.  But if you haven&#8217;t been raised to be secure in doing something you really enjoy or setting yourself up for a challenge that you know will transform itself in a few years if you&#8217;re just diligent and patient - people in regular school systems, particularly public school systems, they&#8217;re just trained to get a job.  They really aren&#8217;t trained to think about the creative process or develop a business or figure out how to make it though an economic challenge or make it during a time that your business might be lean or make it off of a lesser budget - from month to month, your budget is different, so you&#8217;ve got to do some economic adjustments in your mathematical computations.  I think that the home schooling afforded the freedom for this kind of thinking and the creative process, the diligence and the pacing that it takes to even be patient with yourself, because it&#8217;s not going to be perfect all the time when you are starting a business.  It&#8217;s going to be up and down until it gets its momentum going.  And so, I feel like her skills have been affected, but also her patience with herself, being in that system, because I have noticed that the people that graduated with her are doing other things or pursuing other careers or fall by the wayside or just can&#8217;t fully - you know, they don&#8217;t take women seriously in this, or as directors, or there are not that many women filmmakers.  AH:  I get a lot of wardrobe jobs from people who are trying to be supportive, because maybe they don&#8217;t [laughing] - if I get too close to the camera, you know.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s like a woman on a pirate ship or something, like some things about women not being in certain places.  JF:  A woman on a ship is bad luck.  AG:  Yeah.  So, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, well, you can do this.  You can hang out with the clothes.&#8221;  So, I said, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll hang out with the clothes a little bit.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve done a lot of different things, because it&#8217;s been like this sort of battle to not run away because I&#8217;m being asked to do all these other things besides the things that are closest to where I know I want to be.  And I have to make my own pieces in order to be where it is that I want to be, or have someone collaborate with me on something where I can be where I want to be.  But I think that, also, people who are - growing up, no matter what type of school system they&#8217;re coming out of, if they&#8217;re lucky enough to have some mentors or people to push them forward, but what I found when I was going to school was that there are some people getting pushed a little bit more forward than I was, and a lot of times they were white males!  [Laughing] And I could literally go up to a professor in one of my classes and be like, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to do dot-dot-dot in a shot,&#8221; and they would literally look at me and go, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re going to have to figure it out.&#8221;  Or, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to have to play around with that.&#8221;  And then, I&#8217;d see a guy come up and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to do this, this, and this in this shot,&#8221; and him, like, get his journal out and sit down with him and tell him exactly how to set exposures or what kind of lenses to get to achieve that thing.  And nobody, even when I was seeking for that, there was nobody there that would really do that for me.  It was always like, &#8220;Figure it out on your own.&#8221;  But they weren&#8217;t telling everybody to figure it out on their own.  They were just telling certain - particularly the ladies - that they needed to figure it out on their own.  So, I think that - I guess where that put me is that I have been figuring out stuff over the years, especially when I later went to Laurel High School.  JF:  That&#8217;s what I was just about to ask you, is how the first twenty years of your life impacted the way you now look, like your ideas of equality and community, and what is possible in terms of social change, and the barriers that are still up against justice, whether it&#8217;s in the University or in our neighborhoods?  AH:  Yeah, wow.  Well, I feel like there&#8217;s always kind of little battles going on in various communities, and somehow I&#8217;m a part of them.  And I have found that, in being a filmmaker, I&#8217;m sort of able to observe, which I prefer, but I inadvertently sometimes end up making a statement anyway.  Like I said earlier, sometimes I try to do this thing where I&#8217;m detaching myself from it on one level or another, but I&#8217;ve had a lot of opinions about - I think that people in general should just be concerned with their environments and how they're living and what&#8217;s going on around them and what&#8217;s going on in schools, whether or not they have children.  It&#8217;s going to somehow affect them or somebody in their family or somebody close to them at one point or another.  It&#8217;s like I always have sort of issues with labels, but I&#8217;ve had sets of friends that like labeling me in different ways or my mother in different ways, but I don&#8217;t like it because to me it feels like it&#8217;s just how things are, it&#8217;s just a way of life, it&#8217;s just a way of being.  We should all want human rights.  We should all want our environment to be good.  We should all want people to be treated fairly and equally.  But that&#8217;s just not what we&#8217;re going through.  So, I&#8217;ve found that more than anything there&#8217;s the people who care about that, and then there&#8217;s the people who don&#8217;t.  And then, there&#8217;s some people that might sort of care about some of the things, [laughs] but not really.  I guess I have found some struggles with labeling, particularly when I'm talking with folks who want to talk about like the feminist movement.  And most of the time that&#8217;s because, I guess I feel like how I&#8217;ve grown up I&#8217;ve just seen it.  It&#8217;s like a human rights issue.  It&#8217;s like a fairness issue.  So, it&#8217;s already something that the people around me fight for without putting a label on it.  And so, it&#8217;s like if you&#8217;re already working really hard for your people being viewed as citizens and people who have actually put their lives into where we live and that we deserve respect just like anybody else, you&#8217;re kind of already doing that for women as well.  It&#8217;s not like I can figure out a way to define exactly what it is that I&#8217;m talking about.  But even if I know that there have been women that I&#8217;ve grown up around that have that sort of point of view, it&#8217;s not like they have to announce it, it&#8217;s not like they have to affirm that they are doing that, because it&#8217;s just a part of who they are and it&#8217;s just a part of what they&#8217;re doing and it&#8217;s just a part of what we have to do to take care of ourselves to be able to be.  And the other part of it is I think that labels like that sometimes keep us from talking about overall issues.  So, sometimes I try to avoid certain conversations, because it&#8217;s like one movement is more of an issue than another, one movement is supposed to be older than another.  I sometimes do this thing where -  JF:  Wow, that sounds so much like what your mom was saying right before we took the break to restart with you.  [Laughter]  AH:  So, yeah, sometimes I&#8217;ll be in a conversation where it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, yeah, now we&#8217;re talking about race.  Now&#8217;s the time to talk about race,&#8221; and something else comes up.  And it&#8217;s like, okay, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m trying to devalue what gays and lesbians and bisexual and transgender people are going through right now, but I don&#8217;t want that conversation to come up as a way to try to not talk about this thing over here.  So, can we just finish this one up here and then move on to that?  And as we&#8217;re talking about the different stuff, let&#8217;s not be unrealistic about what it is that causes these things, because it&#8217;s a different subject.  Even though there are injustices going on in all these different areas, it&#8217;s not always the same kind of injustice.  And it&#8217;s okay to say that.  You don&#8217;t have to be like. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going through this,&#8221; or, &#8220;I did that.&#8221;  Recently, I was talking with a white guy who&#8217;s a friend of mine, and he goes into the &#8220;when I had long hair&#8221; thing.  And I&#8217;m like, okay, if I hear the &#8220;I got treated the same way that you&#8217;ve gotten treated on a regular basis when I had longer hair&#8221; thing one more time - [laughs].  It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not the same.  I&#8217;m not saying that you didn&#8217;t go through a set of whatever because you had longer hair or you did whatever, but that&#8217;s not what this is.&#8221;  A lot of times when people just kind of step back and look, you do see a grander scheme, maybe a grander economic scheme or a grander scheme about how to separate people from each other, from being able to have conversations.  But typically we&#8217;re not talking about that when folks are sitting down and talking about that.  When people are sitting down and talking about injustices, you&#8217;re not talking about this grand scheme of how folks are separated.  They&#8217;re actually trying to gear the conversation in a way where&#8217;s it&#8217;s like going to be more separation when we&#8217;re done having the discussion.  I think that in the work I do I usually am just trying to look at stuff, just looking at opinions, because that&#8217;s really all I can do.  Occasionally, I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m full in this conversation.  This is why I&#8217;m having this conversation.&#8221;  Maybe I feel like somebody needs to know something.  I might let it go for a little bit, and then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  Maybe somebody needs to tell this person that.&#8221;  [Laughter] But most of the time I&#8217;m engaging myself in conversations with people where I can find out as much as I can about how they feel and why they feel that way.  And then, I&#8217;m just trying to look at it, and if I see comparisons, what I do in my documentary work is I try to show comparisons.  I try to go, &#8220;Look at this, and look at this.  Oh, now look at them next to each other!  Well, what about that?&#8221;  JF:  That sort of echoes what your mom was saying.  You were saying that - you said that you&#8217;re still researching.  You&#8217;re still pulling this together and putting pieces together.  AB:  Yes, always learning.  Learning doesn&#8217;t stop.  So, when you think in degrees or diplomas, and it kind of starts and stops, and once you get that one job or whatever, you kind of get stuck.  But I feel good about having been able to study a lot of different things in a lot of different ways in a lot of different places.  Listening to Amira, I can hear - one of your questions was about networking and allies and overlapping - and as she was talking, I could see some of the networks, because you said a lot of people mention Carpetbag Theater.  Linda Parris-Bailey was the director of the first youth program, the Summer Youth Workshop, when it started in its original form in the [19]80s, which I think Hubert Sapp started also.  She was director, and so Amira did get involved with Carpetbag Theater&#8217;s Intergenerational Theater Project, and she looks at Linda Parris-Bailey as one of her mentors.  So, that&#8217;s kind of a piece of the Highlander connection.  AH:  Woman Tour.  [Laughter]  AB:  Woman Tour.  Alternate Roots was founded at Highlander, and that&#8217;s kind of a southern-based arts activist organization, a network of arts activists, primarily from the South, but also from around the country.  And then, the Tennessee Economic Renewal Network was founded here at Highlander.  So, there are some kind of overlapping circles and overlapping networks, but when she was talking, I could also see the cultural pieces and how they evolve and overlap, too.  It&#8217;s that history of a cultural worker, I think, that threads through all these different stories and has another conversation of its own that I could see kind of happening in layers.  As she was bringing up new subjects, I could just hear other layers of that cultural dialogue.  JF:  I think we should have another session sometime where we sit down and talk again as a group.  AH:  Okay.  JF:  And maybe in a few years, your [Amira&#8217;s] daughter could join us, too.  [Laughter]  AH:  Okay.  JF:  And give her perspective.  AH:  Yeah.  JF:  This has been a real pleasure.  I really thank you, Amira, for joining us, and Aisha, thank you for all the stories you&#8217;ve shared with me today.  AB:  Thank you.  JF:  Is there anything that either of you would like to add before we finish up?  AH:  No.  AB:  I really appreciate you interviewing me and getting the opportunity to remember some of these things and talk about it in this context.  JF:  My pleasure.  AB:  It does overlap in a feminist way, so it&#8217;s very interesting to look at it like that.  I learned a lot today even.
