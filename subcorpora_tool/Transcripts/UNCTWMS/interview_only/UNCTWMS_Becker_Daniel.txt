Jennifer Donnally: Good afternoon. Today is August 16, 2011. My name is Jennifer Donnally and today I am interviewing&#8212;. Why don&#8217;t you introduce yourself?
Dan Becker: Dan Becker, Daniel Becker, Georgia Right-to-Life president.
JD: And it&#8217;s about 1:00 in the afternoon. I don&#8217;t know the exact time. My first question&#8212;oh, and I forgot to warn you about this first question&#8212;where did you grow up and what was your childhood like?
DB: I grew up here in Georgia. We were transplanted from up north, at a very early age my family moved down here, so I was raised in the Georgia school system in the Doraville-Chamblee area. I attended Chamblee High School and graduated in 1970 and went off to Emmaus Bible College in 1970 through [19]73. It was a three-year school, seminary studies.
JD: What denomination?
DB: It was Plymouth Brethren, which is evangelical.
JD: So you went to Bible college in the denomination that you grew up in.
DB: That&#8217;s correct.
JD: Are you still Plymouth Brethren?
DB: No, I attend a Southern Baptist church right now.
JD: Okay. So what was Bible college like at that point in time in the [19]70s?
DB: It was intense and foundational to shaping my worldview around a biblical perspective, and it was out of that that our emphasis shifted to pro-life work. It enabled me to segment and compartmentalize a lot of actions, activities, policies and strategies. We call it a biblical worldview.
JD: Okay. Now did you go to college in mind to become a minister, or what were you&#8212;?
DB: It was a foundation for life. It allowed for various tracks at the conclusion of the time of study, one of which led me to Switzerland to study under Dr. Francis Schaeffer at L&#8217;Abri, the fellowship there that dealt with Christian worldview issues and applying them to the culture.
JD: And he was already well known at this point in time when you came to Switzerland.
DB: He was. He was at the peak of his publishing career and we, as students in college, had read most of his works. He was very famous and it was just the icing on the cake at the end of a time of academic endeavor to show up at L&#8217;Abri and sit under his teaching and direction for a period of time, which I was delighted to do, just before I got married and just before I settled down into a profession.
JD: So how long were there in Switzerland under Schaeffer?
DB: It was not long. It was a short-term summer mission so I was there for four weeks, living in the village nearby and even slept under his dining room table with my wife one evening when we came in late and there was no room in the inn, so they put us in their own home. That&#8217;s a unique experience, waking up in the Swiss Alps under Dr. Schaeffer&#8217;s dining room table, with your sleeping bag rolled out.
JD: That&#8217;s a story for the grandchildren [Laughs].
DB: Oh, it is, it is.
JD: So then you met your wife in college then too?
DB: She was part of our church relationships here, youth groups and so forth, here in the local city of Atlanta so I knew her prior to college, but we dated for five years, and she&#8217;s the only sweetheart in my life, and we had five children. They had on average five children so I have twenty-six grandchildren.
JD: That&#8217;s very exciting. I&#8217;m the youngest of five.
DB: They&#8217;re all following the Lord. It&#8217;s a delight. Since my wife&#8217;s death six years ago to breast cancer, I live with my eldest son and his eight children.
JD: I&#8217;m sorry to hear about your wife.
DB:  Well it&#8217;s something that just enhances what I&#8217;m doing here.
JD: Earlier prior to when we started the interview you said that Dr. Schaeffer is the one who first introduced you to the concept of abortion or your knowledge of it.
DB: Yeah, during some of the student discussion that we had in his den down by his fireplace he would sit there and entertain current events and discuss them and how do you apply a biblical worldview to current events, how do you shape culture, how do you inform public policy. Those were the challenges we were faced with as college grads and many of them were quite secular in background so it was a question of&#8212;. Actually, the range was pretty broad. But the number of Christian students that were there&#8212;. When he brought up the recent Supreme Court decision that had occurred just a few months before called Roe v. Wade he said here is a Supreme Court decision that is going to shape Western civilization and it&#8217;s going to change everything that we know, and I&#8217;ll be honest, even as a Bible college grad I had no way to connect the dots. I didn&#8217;t see what he was talking about. Yet we heard what he had to say and of course subsequent publications&#8212;Whatever Happened to the Human Race?&#8212;all brought clarity to the point that he was making, that how we value human life shapes everything else in a culture, from private property to personal rights and so forth. So the sanctity of life became the bedrock of what I took from L&#8217;Abri during that time of study there and of course it was instrumental in shaping my thinking in years to come.
JD: When Roe v. Wade came out in January, 1973, was it even on your radar screen? Do you remember it? Did it mark an occasion for you at all?
DB: Well, no. I mean I read the headline but it had no meaning beyond that. It wasn&#8217;t until three months later that I was at L&#8217;Abri that he brought a definite application to the culture that we needed to consider long-term. Now I will say everything that he said has come to pass. He was a prophet in his own time, predicting exactly how society would respond in a given circumstance, and it&#8217;s part of my background as a reform advocate that you look at how ideas have consequences in the culture, so your worldview does shape exactly what we do in the way of public policy. I&#8217;m grateful to live in a country where Judeo-Christian values were upheld and had a significant portion of our founding tied to it. The fact that we&#8217;re moving away from that has significant consequence within a culture and what he predicted has come about and we are now trying to address some of those same issues in the twenty-first century as we see probably pro-life 2.0, to use a current term. We believe that the twentieth century was about abortion; we believe the twenty-first century will be about human life itself, the sanctity of human life as it&#8217;s expressed through our public policy for stem cell research, emerging technology, human-animal hybrids, eugenics, a whole host of things that the pro-life movement itself has not currently embraced. We believe that that&#8217;s the challenge of the twenty-first century that we face.
JD: Okay. So that&#8217;s what, when you said you&#8217;re the cutting edge, that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s coming from. Okay, so going back, you said that you went to Switzerland, came back, and then started a career and a family with your wife.
DB: We started a family first. The career was slow to follow. I was a union apprentice carpenter for four years and I had five children in six years and it was hard to do that on a wage-earner apprentice salary. I became a journeyman carpenter and enjoyed that profession for fourteen years but because of the large family and the needs the hourly wage wasn&#8217;t cutting it so I started my own business doing exquisite woodworking through my commercial contacts, and I became the owner of the largest architectural millwork installer in the nation, one of the largest in the nation. It was out of that that I was able to fund a lot of my extracurricular nonprofit activity. Today, eleven years later, I haven&#8217;t drawn a dime from Georgia Right to Life. I&#8217;m one hundred percent volunteer. But that business also allowed me to run for Congress in 1992, so I was able to take time off from my business. We&#8217;re celebrating our thirtieth year as a corporation.
JD: Is it family owned?
DB: It is; it&#8217;s a hundred percent owned corporation. This is our thirtieth year.
JD: Congratulations. Okay, so then you had a busy time in the &#8217;70s if you were&#8212;. So if it&#8217;s thirtieth year, it started in &#8217;81, you started your own business.
DB: 1981.
JD: Okay. When did you start becoming active in the pro-life movement?
DB: We were active immediately. We&#8217;ve never not been active, because Francis Schaeffer activated the evangelical movement in the late [19]70s. He held a rally here in Atlanta that many of the foundational evangelicals attended because of his film series, Whatever Happened to the Human Race?
JD: When was that?
DB: [19]79?
JD: Okay, I was going to say, Whatever Happened to the Human Race? I think came out in [19]78 and he did the tour, so this is when he came for the national tour.
DB: That&#8217;s correct.
JD: Okay, so then he came to Atlanta in 1979.
DB: As a carpenter apprentice, having school two nights a week in downtown Atlanta, I didn&#8217;t go home those evenings, I had time to kill, and I would take my hardhat and my sign and I would march in front of the local abortion clinic by myself. I mean that was part of the outworking of my faith and worldview. Midtown Clinic was notorious at the time for being one of the largest in the southeastern United States.
JD: And when did you start protesting at the clinic?
DB: The [19]70s. It was prior to his national tour so it would be [19]77, [19]78.
JD: So you were all by yourself protesting?
DB: All by myself with my hardhat, yeah, just a hardhat blue collar worker out protesting about the taking of innocent human life.
JD: What pushed you to do that all by yourself? Was it just like one night you were like, I&#8217;m going to do this now?
DB: There was nothing that triggered it. It was an outworking of how I spent my time, my free time, and I wanted my free time to count for eternity and protesting the devaluing of human life and where that would lead, according to Schaeffer&#8217;s prediction, to a wholesale genocide, and it wouldn&#8217;t stop at just abortion. It would continue well beyond that. That was my concern and it led me to stop by a drugstore, get some poster board, get a marker, and express my opinion as an activist. It&#8217;s applying your faith. It&#8217;s a faithful application of your biblical worldview.
JD: At that time was your church involved in any of the activism, or what church were you attending at that point of time in Atlanta?
DB: The church was not, but interestingly enough I became the moral-concerns director. Having attended Bible college I was tapped to take on that role and one of the first things that came to my attention was a ministry that was run by a gentleman named Mr. Phillips. I forget his name; I&#8217;ll have it in a second. He was starting something called a pregnancy resource center in Atlanta and it became actually the first ever pregnancy resource center, crisis pregnancy center, in the city of Atlanta, called Atlanta Care Center. I met him at a barbecue one evening and I took his ministry to our local church, Landmark Church, and asked that they consider supporting that as a ministry with monthly donations, which they agreed to do, and we became the first church in the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia to support, with our monthly giving, a pregnancy resource center.
JD: And it was run by Mr. Phillips, because a lot of times, a pregnancy crisis center, eventually a lot of female volunteers really come there.
DB: This was definitely a male-led effort because it was at the burgeoning front end of the pregnancy resource movement and that was the first in Atlanta. God put it on his heart, he responded, he ran that organization for about fifteen years, turned it over to another gentleman who is from my neighborhood and is now running for office. It&#8217;s been interesting to see that dynamic, how the politics and the principle all line up to activism at all levels, so it&#8217;s hand-in-glove, and we believe that one informs the other, our biblical faith, our actions, our life choices, and so forth. But Atlanta Care became the first in Atlanta, we were the first church, we were always noted as being foundational in getting that established, and it&#8217;s part of my joy to have been the instrument in bringing that about.
JD: So then since you started your activism earlier, what was it like watching Francis Schaeffer come in and show Whatever Happened to the Human Race? What were the ramifications of that, coming to Atlanta?
DB: In his national tour he met at Five Points park, and an overwhelming amount of people&#8212;. Now the pro-life movement within evangelical circles was virtually unknown. It wasn&#8217;t until his film series alerted us to the fact. Catholic teaching and the Catholic Church had a well deserved position at the top of the leadership chain for their long-time activism and focus on the issue. We were the Johnny-come-lately&#8217;s and we actually were called to come in, come alongside of, and serve in the pro-life movement under the current leadership, which we did for over a couple decades. It was his infusion of fresh blood into the movement that then led to Operation Rescue and a whole host of other ministries and organizations that are around today that embraced both Catholic and Protestant as co-belligerents for the same cause. So we joined forces and early on in the movement worked out that we agreed that we were co-belligerents for a cause, we weren&#8217;t seeking to set up a church in any way, form, or fashion where we agreed on everything, but that we were agreed on policy, we were agreed on church teaching, and I would say for the record that I greatly appreciate the encyclicals that have been put out by the Roman Catholic Church: Evangelium Vitae, Dignitas Personae, Humanae Vitae, all of these encyclicals. We share that same teaching, that same basic biblical approach to how we view the sanctity of life, and it&#8217;s foundational to our co-belligerence, it&#8217;s foundational to our unity, and always has been.
JD: So then when did you become involved with Georgia Right to Life, because Georgia Right to Life has a long history prior to Roe v. Wade, and if I&#8217;m not mistaken it was started by Catholics in Georgia?
DB: An event happened prior to my coming onto Georgia Right to Life. In 1992, after having successfully developed a national carpentry insulation firm&#8212;. We do all the high-end commercial work in the city of Atlanta. I sold that business a while back. I&#8217;m in communication and technology now, but my partner with me at the time now owns the business and it&#8217;s still right up there. Taking the proceeds of the business and the freedom as being CEO I ran for Congress in 1992. It was for no other reason than to have the biblical worldview representative from here in the Deep South Bible Belt, from a district that was deeply conservative but Democrat at the time, north Georgia. It was Georgia&#8217;s 9th district, which from corner to corner, in the northern portion of the state down to Cumming, was a significant portion of the state, mostly mountainous, mostly blue collar, and certainly pro-life. But they had never voted Republican ever, and I was the first Republican that actually had a chance to win. I set a record with the amount of votes that I got for a Republican to date, and that record stood even after my defeat in the general election. But what&#8217;s noted about the general election&#8212;and I didn&#8217;t start off with this in mind; I started off with nothing more than wanting Christian representation at a congressional level&#8212;was that as a federal candidate I had what was called a protected class, free speech. I had something that even state reps and state senators weren&#8217;t afforded, and that is free and open access to the airwaves for anything I wanted to say. In other words federal free speech trumps state free speech and a federal candidate could not be denied access to TV. We had to be granted the lowest possible advertisement rate and we could say in an ad whatever we wanted to say. Well I set a legal record by becoming the first federal candidate in U.S. history to have free speech censored with a federal court order using prior restraint. Never had a federal court order forbidden a federal candidate to speak, and yet I was, based on the content of my speech, denied access to the TV [stations]. Now granted it was a unique circumstance because I wanted to use my protected class, after I found out into the campaign that I actually could, to air what had never been seen on TV before, which was actual first-, second-, third-trimester abortion. I took out infomercial, I showed aborted baby parts as part of my commercial in a sixty-second ad that ran during the Atlanta Braves game, and it was&#8212;.
JD: That was when the Atlanta Braves were at the top of their game.
DB: The Atlanta Braves were at that time clinching the division for the first time in twenty years of the franchise, so it was one of the most widely watched shows in Atlanta history, and the ad was aired with a warning, saying that we&#8217;re going to show you something disturbing and please turn the children away. I did show it and it made national news. CNN ran it; I was on Good Morning America; I had numerous interviews; the networks picked it up and aired it internationally. It became the first time that abortion was actually seen stripped of its rhetoric. It was visual; it was visceral; it was something that elicited an immediate repugnant response in many. It called the question: When we talk about a woman&#8217;s right to choose are we talking about this? It actually showed a severed face, a baby&#8217;s head being pulled from the birth canal. I mean it was graphic stuff. They aired it but then they stopped airing it. We took them to court and it developed a court case and the courts actually denied my general election ad.         I won the primary, I had three opponents; those three opponents thought that abortion would be the kiss of death. Showing ads on TV would be the kiss of death politically. I swept the opponents, and this was against political pundits, public opinion, and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. I was on the front page for seven days in a row with the event, so it was something that broke new territory and it was actually another gentleman from Indiana, Michael Bailey, that did it a month before me but gave me the idea that I could use my candidacy if I wanted to. I knew I was sacrificing potential election for getting the word out and then I got to thinking, &#8220;Which is more important, to proclaim truth to the culture, which is what we were challenged under Schaeffer to do, or to get elected and influence public policy?&#8221; Well I figured that even if I lost I could still impact public policy, which has proven true through the years.         So the power of influence sometimes is greater than the power of authority and it was something that I had to decide then and there and knew I would lose the election but still make a point. The point that I make is that by focusing on the wrong of abortion and publicly proclaiming it and asking voters to consider changing public policy is actually a winner. That is a winner politically and Georgia&#8217;s 9th district has produced most of our pro-life leadership, it has produced two congressmen, one of which was a former Georgia Right to Life chapter leader. It produced the leader of our pro-life caucus down at the Georgia house; it&#8217;s produced our lieutenant governor; it&#8217;s produced our governor. Every pro-life gain that we enjoy today, and that is that all nine constitutional offices elected statewide in Georgia, if it&#8217;s a statewide vote for public service commissioner or insurance or agricultural commissioner, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, attorney general, all of them are not just pro-life, they&#8217;re pro-life without exceptions, no rape and incest exceptions allowed, and we&#8217;re the only state in the nation that can make that claim. And, every one of them have declared publicly that they support a personhood amendment to the Georgia constitution. So the gains that have come out of establishing a very bold and pragmatic and prudential approach to politics defies political convention and yet it&#8217;s true here in Georgia that you can shape public opinion through the political process by a bold proclamation of principle, and that&#8217;s clearly evident by what has been done over the last twelve years here in Georgia.         But that race propelled me into the limelight locally here in the state and it was from that popularity and public exposure that Georgia Right to Life came in 1999 and asked me to come on as the political director, the PAC director.
JD: Okay, that helps explain. So we&#8217;re jumping back in time, back to 1979. So Francis Schaeffer came. What sort of mobilization and activities were you doing in the early [19]80s then, around right to life?
DB: Primarily working through the church, just simple education, and raising a family, spare time moral concerns ministry things with Atlanta Care. It was very limited because there wasn&#8217;t a large volunteer base at the time.
JD: After Francis Schaeffer came, did evangelical churches start meeting with each other? So it sounds like you&#8217;re at Landmark and doing a lot from Landmark as a base, but when did you start to connect to other churches?
DB: That didn&#8217;t actually happen until 1987 when Operation Rescue, Randall Terry, came to Atlanta, so between the late &#8217;70s and the late &#8217;80s there was a ten-year period where education was the name of the game. The evangelical base was being educated, the Catholic base was being activated and educated, and then we would take what few voices we had out there, Pat Robertson being one with the advent of Christian television. The life issue became central to our politics. Jerry Falwell, the Moral Majority was the only thing working at the time for us that could coordinate activity, and not anybody that I knew was involved. So, even that era from the late [19]70s to the [19]80s was pretty dark on my radar screen and not much going on. It was primarily Catholic activity within the Catholic churches which [was] nothing new. That was ongoing.
JD: Did you continue to protest outside of Midtown in that period though, or once you were out of the carpentry school two times a week did you&#8212;
DB: No, I was&#8212;.
JD: &#8212;use most of your energy starting your own company?
DB: Yeah, all my energies went into my moral concerns ministry at the local church and raising my family.
JD: Were there any other issues that you addressed when you were looking through the moral concerns ministry?
DB: Well, I mean, besides normal missions, foreign missions, doctrinal concerns&#8212;I served as a deacon during that timeframe&#8212;no, there were no other social issues that caught my attention.
JD: That&#8217;s quite a bit of work right there, that you just listed. [Laughs] So then you said 1987 Randall Terry came in, so what started happening, or how did Randall Terry come in? Was there contact at the local level to say to Randall Terry and Operation Rescue, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come to Atlanta, it might be smart for you to come to Atlanta,&#8221; or&#8212;?
DB: The national Democratic convention was being hosted in Atlanta in 1987 for the [19]88 elections. Randall Terry, seeing an opportunity to use the Democratic national convention as a platform for activity used that as a backdrop to come to Atlanta from wherever he was up in New York and connect with some churches down here. One of the churches that he connected with was Perimeter Presbyterian. Randy Pope was the pastor. He hadn&#8217;t been in Atlanta very long at all. He now has one of the largest churches in the nation and is a well known Presbyterian pastor here in the Atlanta area. But at the time he was fresh, he was new, and he was only a few miles from here and our church was a few miles from here, and they had announced through their congregation that Randall Terry was going to be there to address the abortion issue and, &#8221;Please come and hear what he had to say.&#8221; Many people from our church went, from surrounding churches went, over to Perimeter Pres and heard what Randall Terry had to share in the way of activism. Now if you&#8217;ll think, Francis Schaeffer had either died or was&#8212;
JD: Was in declining health.
DB: &#8212;was in declining health and C. Everett Koop had left the scene, I&#8217;m pretty sure.
JD: Well he was Surgeon General under Reagan.
DB: Yeah. So we&#8217;re dealing with a dearth of leadership nationally and there had been a decline in any interest. I know that for a fact. We were commenting at the time that there was a significant decline in focus on the sanctity of life issue.
JD: Do you think that was&#8212;and I didn&#8217;t ask you this&#8212;do you think part of that was because of the failure to pass the Human Life Amendment in [19]83 and [19]84, because there was so much momentum when Reagan got elected in 1980 and expectation and then it didn&#8217;t pass.
DB: It didn&#8217;t pass, and you had the Hyde Amendment in I believe [19]87, and we can discuss that later, but I think that was the most serious blow to the pro-life movement in the history of the movement, was the passage of the Hyde Amendment, and there are distinct reasons for that and that&#8217;s where the debate and dialogue from the early [19]80s and the mid &#8217;80s. Now historically what was going on is that the leader of the March for Life in Washington, DC, Nellie Gray, broke away from national Right to Life over the debate of political endorsements and political action involving rape and incest exceptions. So Nellie Gray broke originally as a national Right to Life board member over the issue of personhood and whether or not you protect all classes of human life with your law and your politics, your strategy. That debate split the movement and of course the March for Life came out of that. She instituted what was called the life principles and she reads those at every Washington, DC national March for Life, every year. Judie Brown split.
JD: Also split.
DB: And that was largely over the Hyde Amendment itself where for the first time the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was advocating that a class of human life could be executed, could be killed under the law, based on their manner of conception. That had never happened before. So we were faced with a debate within the movement. Should we save some&#8212;? Should we participate in evil in order that good may come? Now the opponents would argue that that wasn&#8217;t a fair assessment of the situation, but it was allowing for human execution of children based on their manner of conception in order to achieve a higher good, in their mind, and that would have been the broader, achievable, prudent action that for the first time the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops approved. Well, that split the movement and the national Right to Life board was split as well, and the leadership that was elected and is in place currently today were the ones who rejected that position.         It was my coming along and reevaluating the debate that raised it again for the third time in the history of the movement and I questioned from an evangelical standpoint the strategy of breaking God&#8217;s law in Deuteronomy 24:16, where it specifically says you shall not put a child to death for the crimes of its father, or its parents. In other words each individual is responsible for their own action and if there&#8217;s an innocent party the guilt doesn&#8217;t attach to the innocent party. Now when we became a faith-based organization the year I came on board in 2000 we agreed as an organization to reexamine everything that we did in that light, and that was one of the policy decisions that had to be changed immediately.
JD: So in other words, when you do a personhood amendment it&#8217;s personhood, no exceptions.
DB: It&#8217;s personhood&#8212;. Well all of the bills Georgia Right to Life has done have no exceptions. We&#8217;re the only state in the nation, other than Michigan&#8212;two states in the nation&#8212;we&#8217;re the only state that once allowed rape and incest exceptions and then removed that as a policy objective.
JD: Was there divisions within the state level over this debate in the &#8217;80s, or even when you came in, in 1999? Did you ruffle feathers, in other words?
DB: Yeah, no, there wasn&#8217;t&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know what the debate was over the Judie Brown and Nellie Gray controversy. It was Catholic-on-Catholic debate at that time because it was Catholic leadership. Catholic leadership remained in place until 1996 or &#8217;97. You&#8217;ll get that from Gen Wilson, our president. I think she was the first Protestant president of Georgia Right to Life, working closely with the archdiocese and the Catholic leadership. I mean it was a mutual&#8212;. It wasn&#8217;t anything negative. The debate did lead to several members of our board resigning back in 2001 when we actually applied it in our first political race. We removed rape and incest exceptions as an endorsement criteria, allowable endorsement criteria, here in Georgia, so from the moment we did that until today we have seen nothing but political good come as a result of holding what we call a biblical standard. We&#8217;re not kingmakers. We differ from Christian Coalition and other groups out there who want to continue having access after the election is over. We hold a standard and we judge everyone according to that standard, so we don&#8217;t treat anyone with any favor. If they meet the standard we give them our approval and we don&#8217;t endorse one over another. We have done that to our harm early in the process and we changed our ways quite quickly and realized that&#8217;s not what we were being called to do, but to uphold a certain standard that all men had to meet.         That controversy during the Hyde Amendment shaped the current pro-life movement, and what&#8217;s shaping it now is a move back to principle and it&#8217;s called the personhood movement and it was launched here in Georgia in 2007 when Representative Martin Scott, through my coordination with him&#8212;. He was my former campaign aide in 1992, the connection there being that he was fully on-board with what we were doing, he had advanced in politics. He&#8217;s now a House rep. He became the sponsor of the nation&#8217;s first-ever state human life amendment at a state level. It had never been tried before because the debate at the national level lost in the early [19]80s with Nellie Gray and it lost again under Judie Brown&#8217;s debate. So it wasn&#8217;t that I knew this history; I didn&#8217;t.
JD: So you didn&#8217;t really know too much about the amendment before you came in, in 1999.
DB: No, I didn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t know any of this. It was something that we developed locally as a result of our biblical worldview, our faith in action.
JD: So you somewhat were inventing the wheel and sort of reinventing it.
DB: Exactly. We thought we were. It wasn&#8217;t until our opponents at national Right to Life in the current leadership began pointing out that all you&#8217;re doing is raising the specter of debate again, and we&#8217;ve already settled this twice. Somebody came up and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re going Judie Brown on us,&#8221; and I had no idea what that meant.
JD: So had you ever even heard of Judie Brown at that point?
DB: No, never heard of her. There was no former collusion or any kind of former history. It was just that from a Protestant evangelical perspective we couldn&#8217;t do what the movement was saying we should do and we disagreed with the application of their policy strategy. The policy we were good on. They agree with us that a child should not be put to death for the crimes of its father. They disagree with rape and incest exceptions but they allow them, and they always have, since 1987, and it was significant that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was the driving force behind a shift in their opinion that allowed that for the first time. Had they held firm I think we would have stopped abortion in the twentieth century, quite frankly.
JD: So Terry Randall came&#8212;. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m still going&#8212;. We&#8217;re jumping all over timelines, trying to get this. So in 1987 Terry Randall came and started talking. How many people were attending those&#8212;?
DB: Randall Terry.
JD: Randall Terry. I always like to switch the name. It&#8217;s one of my fun things that I continually make that mistake.
DB: There were about two hundred people at that initial meeting at Perimeter [Presbyterian] and it was attended by such a diverse group from Catholic to Protestant across the board. It was mesmerizing. It was absolutely&#8212;. The electricity in the room, from an era of almost a decade of nothing to seeing actual faces of people who placed the issue as central to their core values and wanted to do something about it. It was electrifying and the energy and the optimism and the fact that we could do something. I was drawn to the whole thing but I had personal theological differences based on my Bible training background in that I couldn&#8217;t see taking the law, anarchy, into our own hands without being led by civil magistrate. In other words it&#8217;s the whole doctrinal discussion of civil disobedience and the use of it in promoting a social agenda, and I have absolutely no problem with civil disobedience and being arrested, standing for what I believe in, as long as it&#8217;s done with a civil magistrate at the head of the movement, at the head of the action. If we could have gotten anyone that was an elected official or a government official of any kind to come and lead the group, to sit in front of the abortion clinics, I would have been right there next to them. In fact I went to a congressman, the only conservative congressman elected at the time from Georgia, and asked him to do just that and he declined based on it would be several months before the general election and he wanted to get re-elected and he didn&#8217;t want this to skew his re-election bid. He lost, and so that didn&#8217;t become an issue.         I went to Randall Terry personally. First I went to my pastor, who as moral-concerns director for the church, Landmark Church, sent me to our parent church and one of the largest, Mount Paran Church of God. They had a lot of activists at that meeting. He wanted me to represent our church to the larger movement that was going on, and that included two significant pastors in the city of Atlanta of the largest churches in Atlanta. One of them was Dr. Charles Stanley of First Baptist of Atlanta, and the other was Dr. Paul Walker of Mount Paran Church of God, and I was tasked as the liaison to them because they shared my theological concern. They didn&#8217;t agree with the civil disobedience without a civil magistrate.
JD: And what was the importance of the civil magistrate? Sorry, I&#8217;m not as familiar with these theological arguments.
DB: The theological argument from&#8212;. The Huguenot movement in France was a religious movement that sought religious independence from the church and from the French government and they ended up being slaughtered on St. Valentine&#8217;s Day massacre.
JD: Or those who were lucky moved to the United States.
DB: Right, and quite frankly they were the ones that developed the whole debate and dialogue theologically about what can a citizen of a country do under its lawful king and authority. Romans 13 is the basis for the argument that God raises up all authority, all authority is raised up by him, and we are subject to it. When the peasants&#8217; revolt erupted under Martin Luther during the Reformation he said, &#8220;No, this is illicit. This is an improper use of liberty. This is license.&#8221; You need the authorities to lead the civil charge for change in a culture. You can&#8217;t do that apart from the civil government; otherwise it leads to anarchy, which is exactly what the peasants&#8217; revolt did, and many innocent people died as a result of misguided activism on a social cause. So harkening from that example in history a theology was developed called the doctrine of the civil magistrate that would allow for social disobedience under the guise of godly, divinely appointed authority. Now, we didn&#8217;t say how high that authority was. It only had to be an authority raised up by God. It could be a local justice of the peace; it could be a tax&#8212;. Well, I mean it could be anybody that was duly authorized by the state: sheriff, policeman&#8212;.
JD: But not just a government employee?
DB: Not just a government employee. It had to be somebody in a position of authority that was appointed by the state, recognized by the state, and governed by the state. Then it wouldn&#8217;t be anarchy. What they were doing, it&#8217;s called the doctrine of interposition, and that is a big doctrine in the discussion of the pro-life movement, because the doctrine of interposition says that a civil magistrate, elected by the people or appointed by the government, is established by God as divine authority and can and should interpose himself between an offending higher authority and those God has called him or her to serve. In other words, if you have a state rep, a Georgia House rep, who has been called to serve a certain district, in that district that&#8217;s his God-given role and jurisdiction and so if the US government came in and confiscated all land and all private property and usurped the Constitution, it&#8217;s the job and role of the civil magistrate to interpose himself between the higher role of government that&#8217;s acting improperly and the lower class of people that he&#8217;s tasked to serve.         That is what I went, with a message from these two pastors, to Randall Terry during the initial phase of the Atlanta campaign. I met with his top leadership [and] him, we debated, we talked about the spiritual authority that he had, which I challenged. I told him that he did not have the spiritual authority to come into this town and this state to foment rebellion and anarchy, and that if we could work together in unity that would be the desired goal, and so I was tasked by him, Randall Terry, to set up a meeting with these two pastors and a select group of Christian leaders from the city of Atlanta. That meeting took place in Charles Stanley&#8217;s office in downtown Atlanta at First Baptist of Atlanta, 1987, early in the Atlanta rescue movement&#8212;it was not later, it was earlier in the process&#8212;and it was at that point that Randall Terry disagreed with the pastoral counsel that he was given and the fact that it would split the burgeoning pro-life movement in the state, which it did.
JD: Was there any rescues going on at clinics before this meeting?
DB: There were not.
JD: There was no rescues then whatsoever, or so-called rescues.
DB: No. There were people that would do sidewalk counseling and do what I did, which was walk on the legal sidewalk, perhaps counseling women that came in. There was that, but there was no civil disobedience that was taking place.
JD: You said it was mostly, , it was between [19]79 and &#8217;88 when the big siege happened, it was mostly education based, so is this showing Whatever Happened to the Human Race? in churches, or showing the new Assignment: Life or whatever new videos were coming out, or how did the education work?
DB: There was an increasing focus in the seminaries and in the pulpits that the sanctity of life was a central issue because we&#8217;re created in the image of God. That&#8217;s the underlying doctrinal distinctive that both Catholics and Protestants share, and with that doctrinal persuasion we could see it under attack for the first time through the feminist movement, the late &#8217;60s, and into legal abortion and then abortion on-demand through all nine months with Doe v. Bolton, so consequently we could see the Schaeffer prediction coming true in the culture and it alarmed a lot of pastors and they took it up as an issue. So educating the flock, but there was no activation. What could they do? Aside from picketing, what could they do? Pregnancy resource centers were just starting to come onto the scene so there wasn&#8217;t a lot of outlet for activism, but the populist approach that Randall Terry took was highly attractive, to give people a focus. Here&#8217;s something I can do, and I can become a martyr for Christ and for the unborn. It was something that spoke to both the good and the bad in us, to thumb our nose at an authority that had run amok at the Supreme Court level.         So doing so, it started drawing people from all over the nation. Wichita was an outcome of the success of the initial Atlanta campaign and once it hit the airwaves the third day it was here, the third or fourth day, and became national news because of the national Democratic convention that was here, it drew people. People got on airlines and started coming here by the droves. It was a lot of people from out of state that swelled the ranks of that initial two-hundred person meeting until you were having two hundred people arrested, actually being trained how to do it and so forth. I witnessed this, two of those rescues, and the police brutality and the atrocities that were committed, eyewitness accounts, caught on tape, documented. That&#8217;s the first time American Christians had ever heard that the government was proactive in that way, negatively, with police brutality being purposeful and evident, unabashed, do what we can to hurt whoever, young women, teenagers, young people, pastors, priests, particularly targeting the spiritual leadership, and it was heinous. It was something that even though I oppose the issue of not having met the qualifications for interposition I still was sympathetic.
JD: So then when you were navigating this, you said you witnessed two of them, so does that mean that&#8212;because there&#8217;s a division amongst the roles. There&#8217;s people who decided to peacefully on the sidewalks and there&#8217;s those who decided to risk arrest and then those who decided to risk arrest repeatedly.
DB: Out of the meeting, Randall Terry requested that Dr. Charles Stanley and Dr. Walker, who was present by proxy through somebody that he sent, actually come to the rescue. It was the second rescue they held and they had Baby Doe. Baby Doe was a cadaver of a young child aborted in a third-trimester abortion. They had the child in fluid, formaldehyde, and it would rally the troops. They would use it on the street to show women and so on and so forth. A judge banned the baby from being shown. There was an injunction given against the demonstrators for showing the baby. I met with all the top leadership, including Randall Terry. He had agreed to come to my house over the weekend for a prayer vigil in which we hopefully could forge agreement before he split the pro-life movement here in the city of Atlanta. He agreed to come and at the last minute received an invitation from a large activist church and went there instead. But I worked with Joseph Foreman, Keith Tucci; these are all leaders within the rescue movement. I met with them for a couple meetings to try to hammer out a compromise and an agreeable position.         When he requested that the pastors come to the rescue Dr. Stanley said yes, he agreed, and attended the rescue on Spring Street. It was about two hundred and fifty people present. There were a number of people that were tasked to stand on the sidewalk and not be arrested. So they were legal and Dr. Stanley was among those, but we had a special guest appearance in Jerry Falwell. Jerry Falwell flew in for the rescue and while Joseph Foreman was being handcuffed because of his use of Baby Doe, showing Baby Doe to the crowd, as the police were handcuffing him he tried to hand Baby Doe to Jerry Falwell who didn&#8217;t receive it. Somebody else had to take the baby. But Jerry Falwell was there and I don&#8217;t believe Falwell got arrested but he was there in the crowd egging them on, appreciating them, and Charles Stanley was over there silently watching and observing. And of course it was within a few days of that event that Dr. Stanley  &#8212; and I think it was cosigned by Dr. Walker of Mount Paran, Southern Baptist and Pentecostal, two diverse groups &#8212; signed what was called the white paper. Dr. Stanley issued a white paper condemning civil disobedience and charging it with opening us up to the charge of anarchy.
JD: When you were having these unity prayer meetings what was the alternative that you were proposing for the protest?
DB: That they would find a civil magistrate to lead us as a group in civil disobedience, because it would be that civil magistrate, and at the time we looked we couldn&#8217;t find a single elected official or appointed official willing to do that. Now there is a certain level of theological savvy that you need to have in order to do so, to understand the action, and we now have several. There&#8217;s not a problem with that.
JD: I was going to say, have you ever done then a rescue at a clinic after you found a magistrate?
DB: The rescue movement itself, I&#8217;m working with now the leadership of it&#8212;.
JD: Is this the Forty Day, this organization in Atlanta? What&#8217;s it called?
DB: Forty Days for Life?
JD: Yeah. Is that it, or is that another one?
DB: No, that&#8217;s another one. It&#8217;s Personhood USA, which I sit on the board of directors&#8212;board of advisors, I&#8217;m sorry. They&#8217;re mostly made up of the latent rescue movement. It fell&#8212;. I mean I know Flip Benham quite well, and it has fallen into dis-practice. They&#8217;re not practicing it like they did before because of the stiff federal penalties that have passed into law since then. In other words the clinic regs and the bubble zone and the RICO&#8212;
JD: Under the Freedom of Access, or&#8212;.
DB:&#8212;yeah, RICO statutes [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] that were being charged against the leadership, so the movement itself has backed off. They can&#8217;t stand to lose their property, their homes. I mean everything is up for grabs now. It&#8217;s not just a simple jail sentence. Some are being arrested still. I saw an arrest just last week, a video of it, up in Wyoming. So I can tell you I&#8217;m still working with that element and leadership, quite closely, but the whole issue between us has been agreed. They&#8217;re also in favor of interposition at this point because that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s left them, so that&#8217;s not a point of division at this stage of the pro-life movement.
JD: But you said that Terry did divide the movement in [19]88.
DB: He did. In 1990 a pastor approached Dr. Charles Stanley by the name of John Rowell, whose church is two hundred yards down the road.
JD: And when you say these churches, how many people belong to Mount Paran or the First Baptist?
DB: First Baptist of Atlanta was the second largest church in Georgia at the time.
JD: How many families, over two thousand families?
DB: I hesitate to say. All I know is that&#8212;. And Mount Paran was number three. The largest was ten thousand, so that will give you a scale, so these are significant-size churches and the average church that got involved could easily be in the hundreds, sending people and so on and so forth.         What was unique and startling is that after a decade of inaction all of a sudden there was a flurry of activity, it&#8217;s now on everybody&#8217;s radar, it&#8217;s in the press, it&#8217;s focal, it&#8217;s now becoming a matter of dialogue and debate, and that is in [19]87. By &#8217;90 John Rowell pulled the same group of pastors from the rescue side and the interposition side together in a unifying group at Charles Stanley&#8217;s boardroom to pray weekly, and so the rift was healed within the pro-life movement two years later and we became one cohesive group beginning in 1990, all advocating the same policy and strategy.
JD: What were those policies and strategies?
DB: Well, my campaign came two years later out of that group. It was out of a pastors&#8217; prayer meeting at the Georgia capital that I was challenged to consider running for office. Another pastor ran for office and succeeded in getting elected as a House rep.
JD: Who was that?
DB: Ron Crews, Pastor Ron Crews, reformed Presbyterian, evangelical reformed Presbyterian, and later after he lost his re-election bid after two or three terms he took the position of [president of] Family [Institute] up in Massachusetts, so you may have been up there. He ran the Massachusetts Family [Institute] that opposed same-sex marriage successfully in Massachusetts.
JD: I&#8217;ve interviewed&#8212;. [When I&#8217;m] going back for another oral interview trip[ [1:02:06] Massachusetts Catholic&#8212;.So I&#8217;ve got most of the Catholic interviews done.
DB: Ron Crews headed up the Focus on the Family&#8217;s policy arm, Family Research Council.
JD: Okay. I may ask you for his contact information later on.
DB: I don&#8217;t even know if I have it now. That was a while back. But it was out of that group of pro-life pastors that a number of pro-life initiatives developed and we worked together on them, so it&#8217;s been the basis of our political activity because these men were involved as activists and concerned pro-lifers from the interposition side that wanted to do more and politics became the natural outlet for that.
JD: Now were these meetings&#8212;? It sounds like they had quite a bit of men. Were any women involved? Where were the women representing or coming in office?
DB: Well since it was primarily church leadership&#8212;.
JD: It was mostly men.
DB: Yeah, it would be pastors, and in the evangelical Protestant movement, unless you&#8217;re one of the mainstream Protestant groups, you don&#8217;t have female leadership at a pastoral level.
JD: But where did the women come in? When we talk about Operation Rescue were there any key pivotal female leaders?
DB: Not that I interfaced with. There are, and there were, including the wife of our development director, Madia Bowman, Steve&#8217;s Bowman&#8217;s wife Madia Bowman. She goes back to the early days of being arrested and sidewalk-counseling and so forth. She now has twelve kids so that limited her action there for awhile.
JD: That would do it. [Laughs] I have a sister with four and I don&#8217;t know how you do it with twelve. [Laughs] That&#8217;s a lot. A lot of respect there. So, church leadership, was there any outreach to the black churches in Atlanta?
DB: I mean we&#8217;re the Deep South, okay. We have a problem. Our problem is Jim Crow. It&#8217;s endemic throughout the culture. We encountered it most recently a year and a half ago in our legislative session when we attempted to become the first state in the nation to pass a law banning race-based abortion, abortions strictly on the basis of race, gender, or coerced abortion. So those three things were banned in Georgia law, passed the Senate, and was killed in the House on the last day of session, but it passed all committees in the house. We were told behind the scenes that the white Republican and Democrat Georgia legislators did not want it to come to the floor for a vote, even though they are part of the pro-life caucus. The reason is they feared that if their white daughter was raped by a black man, which is every redneck&#8217;s fear, then they wouldn&#8217;t have an outlet, they wouldn&#8217;t have an alternative except to have their daughter bear that mixed race child, and that is the unspoken fear throughout the South against rape and incest exceptions. They always want to attach rape and incest exceptions to all pro-life law because that&#8217;s the one caveat that even pro-life representatives claim is a step too far, and we were hitting it head on with a law that said if this is race-based and your daughter is pregnant with a mixed-race child and you&#8217;re the one paying for it and urging her to get an abortion, against her will, and there&#8217;s plenty of testimony to that effect, then this is not legal in Georgia and the abortionists can&#8217;t perform the abortion. They&#8217;ll have to go elsewhere. That raised the whole issue to us of where is the black church, where is the black leadership? The year before, we had recognized that Georgia had a problem. We were the largest and first state in the nation killing African American children through abortion.
JD: How did you guys come to realize this?
DB: CDC, the reports from the CDC.
JD: [1:06:42]
DB: And the state of Georgia health and human services releases a report annually, by race, of the abortions committed in Georgia, so we combined the totals and we were number one in the nation per capita. I mean California killed more, and so did New York, but per capita blacks make up thirty percent of our population but they&#8217;re sixty percent of our abortions. So, is that purposeful? Is there an intent behind that? We discovered there was. Tracing back to Margaret Sanger and the founding of Planned Parenthood, the eugenic policy that she had of getting rid of the &#8220;weed seed,&#8221; the unwanted races, the fact that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just a year and a half ago, made a public statement to the effect that: I thought when we legalized abortion that that did away with our problem of getting rid of the people we have too many of. It was a eugenic summary of the policy of Planned Parenthood and abortion on-demand here in America, by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, acknowledging and admitting that that was the purpose for the abortion agenda, to get rid of people we have too many of. And of course when you go into the specific writings of Margaret Sanger, the founding of Planned Parenthood, the eugenic society that underlined the founding of Planned Parenthood, and then you see that Planned Parenthood&#8217;s clinics are all based, here in Georgia, in majority minority neighborhoods. Access to abortion is enhanced primarily for minority communities by the location of the abortion clinics themselves. They claim, &#8221;We go where the client is; we go where the demand is.&#8221; The placing of the abortion clinics in those communities has increased the number of abortions in those communities, so which came first, the chicken or the egg? Well when you go back and you discover that there&#8217;s an intent, that there&#8217;s a specific policy in play, then you have to say, &#8220;Wow. If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.&#8221; And that&#8217;s what we discovered here in Georgia, is that there was a eugenic policy that the African American community was not dealing with nor aware of.         All of our outreach throughout the years of Catholic leadership, evangelical leadership, it didn&#8217;t make any difference; we had no success in reaching into the African American church with this issue. It wasn&#8217;t until it became a civil rights awareness issue, a carryover from the days of Jim Crow and the achieving of civil rights through the civil rights movement, that the black church became aware that they were being targeted, used, and working towards their own destruction as a people. Here in Georgia the African American minority is the only minority that&#8217;s on the decrease. It decreases year on year, while the other minorities increase, so there is a distinct statistical, empirical fact that the African American community has had to deal with and we decided at Georgia Right to Life that we were going to do something about it, and that&#8217;s when we hired our first African American outreach coordinator, Catherine Davis.
JD: So you said two years ago, so it started in 2009 or 2008? When did you guys really start looking at this?
DB: 2007. I came in 2007 as vice president&#8212;2006, November&#8212;with the role of relieving Carol Swift, then president, in November of 2007, so I began effectively directing policy and vision in preparation for that, and one of the first things we did was bring on Catherine Davis as African American outreach. Her task was to make the community aware and she succeeded overwhelmingly, so much so that our billboards, as you heard from Ryan, were picked up by ten other states who were featured on the front cover of Jim Dobson&#8217;s Focus on the Family magazine, Citizen Magazine, June and July of 2008&#8212;or, I&#8217;m sorry, 2009. So we&#8217;re considered, with Alveda King on our board&#8212;.
JD: When did you meet Alveda King, and what was her role in all of this, because she&#8217;s been around for a long time.
DB: She was working for, and still is, Fr. Pavone at Priest for Life, as their African American outreach.
JD: Where is Priest for Life located?
DB: I&#8217;m not sure. I think it&#8217;s New York State.
JD: I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they were in New York State.
DB: But Alveda&#8217;s located here in Atlanta and she&#8217;s been peripheral to what we&#8217;ve done for years. We asked her to come on, Carol did, as a board member and she accepted, so her insight and activity, primarily her friend, Catherine Davis. I mean everything went through Catherine and that&#8217;s why I suggest that if your real purpose is to identify the link, Catherine&#8217;s integral, Ryan is ancillary, because he just basically came on the scene in the last couple years, as he came to us with a project that Catherine recognized had merit and we funded.
JD: Okay.
DB: We funded the website, toomanyaborted.com, the development of it. We funded the billboard ads one hundred percent, there was no other money given.
JD: Was it all through Georgia Right to Life or did you get any help from the national Right to Life committee? It was all state funded?
DB: It was all one hundred percent Georgia Right to Life.
JD: Okay, but you&#8212;        DB: We receive nothing&#8212;.        JD: &#8212;also contributed quite a bit of your own personal finances too, or is it more time?        DB: It&#8217;s time.        JD: Okay. I didn&#8217;t realize&#8212;. I thought national got on and helped on that.        DB: National is&#8212;.        JD: Catching up still?        DB: Still, yeah. I&#8217;m challenging. I mean I believe I&#8217;m loyal opposition and I&#8217;ve taken several opportunities and they&#8217;ve been gracious to allow me.        JD: Does it still work as the fifty-member board, because I&#8217;m not familiar with how it operates today; I&#8217;m more familiar with how it operated prior to the whole [change].        DB: National Right to Life, I think, is an organization in trouble. It&#8217;s deeply divided at its core level, the states are out of touch with the head, and vice versa, probably vice versa being the main point, and they&#8217;re attempting to address some of those things but their refusal to embrace personhood will be their downfall. Organizations all over the nation, and the world, are embracing the debate that happened back in [19]84, &#8217;87, and now 2007 with Georgia introducing the personhood amendment at the state level. That reignited the debate that is now being embraced by Family Research Council, Focus on the Family&#8217;s number-one policy arm. Our language from the 1984 unity agreement is now being promoted as of next legislative session in all fifty states by Family Research Council&#8217;s model legislation for the pro-life movement. They&#8217;re also using our ethical treatment of human embryo bill, which is considered landmark model legislation for the emerging technologies, IVF regulations, regulations on stem cell research, cloning, and human/animal hybrids, and they&#8217;re including it in their catalogue as model legislation that they want to see promoted in other states, so it&#8217;s very affirming to have national groups. American Family Association is the second-largest group in America and they&#8217;re right behind Focus on the Family. They embraced, and you can see all their quotes on the back of the book, Personhood. They&#8217;ve all broken ranks with national Right to Life and AUL and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.        JD: Okay, because those are the big&#8212;. AUL, Americans United for Life, and the legal defense fund, they&#8217;ve been funding a lot of all this.        DB: This book refutes Clarke Forsythe of AUL and his prudence and pragmatism, politics in America book. We are at total odds, strategy wise, as to what is prudent in the political realm. If he defines prudence as winning, being effective, we&#8217;ve done that here in Georgia with the highest standard in the nation for political candidates. No one can touch us.         JD: I&#8217;m assuming you ran in a Republican primary and then on a Republican ticket. Were you born and raised Republican in the South or were you part of the conservative Democrats that became Republican, because you were from the North originally so there was a chance you could have been&#8212;.        DB: My parents voted Democrat and Republican. I voted Democrat and Republican as a young adult.        JD: So you come from an independent family.        DB: Yeah, and I have voted Republican exclusively since then, except when they don&#8217;t run a candidate I can support, in which case I write in a vote. My vote is my most sacred possession and I will not give it to a candidate who believes that a class of human life can be executed under the law, and that includes John McCain, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and any other Republican candidate for President. We broke ranks with national Right to Life as the first group in the nation to not endorse their endorsed candidate in the last presidential election, and our candidate won in the state of Georgia. It was Mike Huckabee. He was the only prudent political choice that didn&#8217;t take a rape and incest exception. There were other candidates in the race that also had a life&#8211;of-the-mother exception. He was winnable, and he won in Georgia against all odds. We were the only group supporting him. So our group support, our state endorsement, swept him against all political pundits into victory, and it was against national Right to Life&#8217;s endorsement as well.        JD: Did national Right to Life endorse McCain pretty quickly? I can&#8217;t remember.        DB: It was Thompson, Fred Thompson.        JD: Okay.        DB: And I was there at the board level for the debate where this issue came up and I respectfully disagree with their decision. I think it harms the movement, it sends the wrong message, it requires a lesser standard, it participates in evil; there&#8217;s a whole host of reasons not to involve yourself with candidates that violate your basic policy, and only support candidates that support your basic policy, your principal position.        JD: I&#8217;m really fascinated with your discussion of the legacy of Jim Crow and the sort of, some would call it, the mythology surrounding a white woman being raped by a black man, or the actual instances of it, or how that plays out in Southern politics. So you found out about it from behind the scenes, because nobody was coming out with it out front, were they?        DB: No. I mean the fact that racism is alive and well in Georgia in the twenty-first century shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone, much less anywhere else in the Deep South. Now it&#8217;s interesting that Mississippi will probably become the first state in the nation to actually pass a personhood amendment in their own state constitution in November of this year. That&#8217;s assuming a positive state supreme court ruling to allow it to reach the ballot, but we&#8217;re presuming that it will and that they will be successful. It is the South that is establishing the protection for the sanctity of all human life and I have to believe that some of that comes out of our Southern heritage of having embraced the outcome of the civil rights movement that all human life is deserving of equal protection under the law.         We see whenever a federal government gets involved in defining personhood rights under their constitution, there tends to be classes of humans left out of those rights. It was slaves under Dred Scott [v. Sanford] and our original Constitution, 1787, one-third of a person. It was the Native Americans, who until 1890 you could take their life on an Indian reservation because they weren&#8217;t persons under the law. Up in Canada it was women during the suffrage movement. The supreme court ruled that even though a woman was elected magistrate to the parliament the prime minister refused to seat her because she wasn&#8217;t a person, and the supreme court of Canada upheld that, she wasn&#8217;t a person. She was denied personhood recognition. The preborn have been denied, the Jews have been denied. It&#8217;s classic to state that the civil rights movement is integral to what we&#8217;re about in the sanctity of life in the twenty-first century. The civil rights movement laid the foundation for awareness that all human life should be protected under the law with equal rights, and having said that, when are we human? Science has already answered the question but the Supreme Court under Roe v. Wade said, &#8220;We can&#8217;t know. We can&#8217;t know when we&#8217;re human.&#8221; Well, we can, and in the twenty-first century that&#8217;s without question. Now it&#8217;s coming down to sentient beings, like dolphins, chimpanzees, should they have personhood and protection? What about the human/animal hybrids that are being created, ninety-eight percent human, two percent cow? Do they have rights? To what portion of humanity will those rights attach? The whole gamut of public policy debate centers around civil rights in the twenty-first century.        JD: So you said you really became aware of this in 2007, 2008. What brought you to become aware of it? When did you really&#8212;? Was it the CDC report that really&#8212;?        DB: No, no, no, and to say that it was a moment in time&#8212;. Margaret Sanger, and anyone in the right to life movement from the late &#8217;80s on, I knew had a eugenic policy and was attached to Planned Parenthood. George Grant is an author who wrote a book called Killer Angel documenting Margaret Sanger and all of the writings and letters, specifically targeting blacks and other unwanted races. It&#8217;s not even debatable. Her influence on Himmler and Adolf Hitler, he sent lieutenants over to study under her to implement eugenic policy back under Nazi rule. So the fact of the matter is eugenics played a huge role in the whole abortion issue early in the game and that&#8217;s knowledgeable to anybody in the pro-life movement regardless, from the [19]60s on. So it was reading that book, knowing that fact, and then actually seeing the numbers work out under our jurisdiction, Georgia Right to Life, how does this affect the black community, realizing the tremendous impact it was having negatively. We decided to take action, not just as bearded white men leading a group, but because of the core issue of ignorance and being unaware of what was happening and being imposed on the community. Anybody can stand up and cry &#8220;fire,&#8221; and we were doing so at the top of our voice but we weren&#8217;t being heard within the African American community. It took a different approach. Alveda helped to shape that, our work with Catherine Davis and Ryan and the billboards. Our bill, the prenatal nondiscrimination act, House Bill 529, filed in 2009, led to a huge political fight and a division of the Republicans into two camps, those that were truly concerned for human rights and those that weren&#8217;t, and right now those that aren&#8217;t, or even some right-to-lifers who claim to be right-to-lifers but they don&#8217;t see this as a human rights issue. So with the acceptance of Jim Crow and some of the ongoing concerns for their white daughters they took a very bold stance in committee and behind the scenes in the caucus, stopping our bill from ever reaching the floor. The African American community is largely silent and ignorant. That&#8217;s changing with the Maafa 21, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re&#8212;.        JD: Actually I&#8217;m not.        DB: Oh, really?        JD: Mm mm.        DB: Nobody&#8217;s mentioned Maafa 21?        JD: Mm mm.        DB: Maafa, spelled M-a-a-f-a, number twenty-one, and I forget what it means in Swahili, I think it means genocide, is a documentary that has effectively about an hour and a half&#8217;s worth of solid documented material showing the targeting of African Americans through abortion, the destruction of the African American race through abortion, as a matter of government policy. The Nixon tapes go well beyond the Watergate scandal. [Laughs] Fortunately some of the Nixon tapes and the excerpts&#8212;.        JD: Are you talking about when Nixon&#8212;okay, yeah. [Laughs]        DB: Actually said, you know, talking about abortion, Planned Parenthood, and whatnot, that this is our means of &#8220;getting rid of the niggers.&#8221; I mean he was very clear about what the intent was. Public federal funding of abortion would allow for the decrease in the targeted race of unwanteds, that Ruth Bader Ginsburg reference. So it&#8217;s coming out of that liberal [19]60s but it is a federal agenda and Maafa 21 has been shown in African American church after African American church to resounding outrage: &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know; we weren&#8217;t informed; this can&#8217;t be true.&#8221; And when you go and actually check out the facts it removes the scale from the eyes and it&#8217;s the African American community itself that is leading the fight now. That is something we could never&#8212;. We&#8217;re just privileged to have been one of the catalysts to help make that happen.         JD: And how did you bring Catherine Davis on board? What was her background and how did you guys recruit her?        DB: I&#8217;m PAC director for eight years at Georgia Right to Life, and I met her when she qualified with us to run for Congress, and because she was running against a well known pro-abort named Cynthia McKinney, a liberal radical, at a national level she received a lot of notoriety, of press, as a conservative challenger.        JD: And Republican?        DB: Yeah, and a black Republican.        JD: Yeah, she hits that wonderful conservative black Republican woman rarity.        DB: Her communication skills, her background, her positions on the issues, led her to be a natural choice for our outreach director into the African American community because she had networked around Atlanta through the black community running for Congress, through the conservative side, and they would be the natural ones to open the door and invite her in for that type of thing; her political connections with Herman Cain and a number of other people.        JD: You seem very informed about what&#8217;s been going on in the Georgia Republican party since the [19]90s. How have you navigated the relationship with the Republican party?        DB: We took it over.         JD: Okay, how did the takeover happen?        DB: 1988, Pat Robertson ran for President and that swept the evangelicals into the political process. Thousands showed up and unseated the liberals that were in place, so we thought. It turned out many of them weren&#8217;t liberal, they were Reagan Republicans, and we had just unseated them. We didn&#8217;t know what we were doing, we didn&#8217;t know how to rule, and in most cases the individual local counties reverted back to the Reagan leadership or some form thereof. The battle still went on but we came into the process as servants rather than as conquerors. We gave up our crown and turned it back over, turned it in for an ability to serve and earn the right to rule, which came about. We progressively in our service were given increasing roles and responsibilities in the party until we actually sought upper rule. By 2001 the real challenge for the party took place and Ralph Reed, of Christian Coalition fame, decided to run for chairmanship of the Georgia GOP, the first time we ever had an avowed Christian conservative run for that position and win. The way he won, was a number of the Christian groups issued endorsements for a slate of candidates called the executive committee. It was made up of about six different positions&#8212;chairman, first vice chair, second vice chair, secretary, and so forth&#8212;that would run the party on a day-to-day basis over the next two years. All the Christian groups issued a slate. We issued our slate for the first time ever utilizing the rape and incest exception and we applied it to the Republican&#8212;        JD: The Republican elections.        DB: &#8212;elections for GOP. Our slate was the only slate that every candidate won. Christian Coalition didn&#8217;t agree with us on some of the candidates. We made the distinction on where they stood on the life issue and Christian coalition said you can&#8217;t elect that slate. Other groups said you can&#8217;t elect that slate; it&#8217;s not pragmatic.        JD: When you say Christian Coalition, they&#8217;re more the kingmakers who are wanting someone to win.        DB: Ralph&#8217;s former organization that he ran nationally, it was his local state affiliate that was involved. Their slate lost&#8212;. It was identical with ours except for one candidate and our candidate prevailed, so not only did we get every single Republican executive officer holding a no-rape-and-incest exception but they were all pro-life at their core, so for the first time ever in the state of Georgia we saw conservatives take power.        JD: So in Kansas, give or take, the Summer of Mercy was really key for conservative mobilization, and I claim and my dissertation argues the 1980s, this is beginning much earlier, and actually what is perhaps different in Wichita is that the local evangelicals and Catholics together invited Operation Rescue and Randall Terry to just descend on them?        DB: No. It&#8217;s largely the press from the Atlanta success that showed activists, hey, there&#8217;s some place we can go. You call the game and we&#8217;ll show up.        JD: But what was the ramifications? So in other words, all that building, when the Summer of Mercy happened it really did help generate the conservative caucus from that point on. Did anything from 1988&#8212;that huge moment&#8212;was there any political ramifications from that or was it just kind of a blip in the radar screen?        DB: The political ramifications was out of the pastors&#8217; unity meeting that took place down in Charles Stanley&#8217;s boardroom. I ran for Congress on a pro-life plank, Ron Crews was elected to office out of that cadre of men, there were numerous activists developed out of that, and that was the rescue/non-rescue crowd coming together, so your activists on the life front were represented, from a spiritual leadership standpoint, by that core and it worked itself into the political.        JD: Before the&#8212;.        DB: I&#8217;m going to open the door here.        JD: Sorry. [Pause] Okay, so let me think about this. Were pastors meeting like that throughout the &#8217;80s or did that come out of the division? So that did come out of that goal for unity&#8212;        DB: Yes it did.        JD: &#8212;and the weekly prayer meetings came out of&#8212;.        DB: There was nothing going on here that I was aware of other than pregnancy resource work and volunteerism, and that had not yet reached the level it is today, its being so pervasive throughout.         JD: That&#8217;s an important modification though, I would say. A lot of times national journals, books and things like that, when they talk about Georgia they would talk about&#8212;. I think it&#8217;s important to know that it came from the pastors locally. How did it spread then? So it&#8217;s being led by pastors in Atlanta; how did it spread out for the rest of Georgia then? How did you guys start getting on the map? Was that pastor to pastor or was it through the Republican party meetings that conservatives were getting together?        DB: Well you have to understand that at a national level Pat Robertson was talking about the life issue as a significant policy issue, for the first time ever. Ronald Reagan was pro-life. I mean the litmus test of appointing pro-life justices was dismal, under Nixon, under Reagan. The most terrible appointees have been Republican appointees. We&#8217;re now to the point where that&#8217;s not the case, where the movement has matured and even at a presidential level, at a national level, what&#8217;s the one litmus test that a Supreme Court justice has: Where do they stand on the sanctity of human life, Roe v. Wade? We&#8217;re there, but we weren&#8217;t in the [19]80s, so you ask what was going on around the state, that spread primarily as the national attention grew and it became more of an awareness issue in our magazines, our newspapers, our TV media. It was just a general rising of all boats as the tide came in, but there was no specific action that can be credited. The Catholic leadership was very active in the Catholic churches, that&#8217;s the one caveat, but not being Catholic I can&#8217;t speak with any specificity to that period of time.        JD: When you say&#8212;and I wanted to ask you more about this in terms of over this period of time&#8212;key are magazines, newspapers, newsletters? What are the big newsletters going out? Were you part of any of the direct mailing routes where they send you the news and update you? What evangelical magazines were you reading? What did that education message look like?        DB: Well primarily through Christian Coalition as an organization that came out of the Pat Robertson campaign of [19]88, that organization, founded by Pat Robertson and run by Ralph Reed. Ralph Reed appeared on the front cover of Time, Newsweek, I mean he&#8217;s the baby face that never aged, you know, guy to represent the pro-life, pro-Christian, pro-family type of movement, so we&#8217;re being spread from &#8217;88 on through the national media and the response&#8212;. [Sound of voices in the background growing louder] Sorry.        JD: Sorry. They&#8217;re just&#8212;. It&#8217;s a little&#8212;. We can maybe keep it a crack.        DB: Well, they&#8217;re&#8212;.        JD: They weren&#8217;t out in the office. Of course they decided to come out in the hallway when we opened the door. That&#8217;s how it always goes. Okay, so&#8212;.        DB: Magazines would be WORLD magazine, that&#8217;s an evangelical publication read by many. They&#8217;re late to the scene; I mean it&#8217;s after the fact. It&#8217;s just assumed that they&#8217;re going to cover pro-life things. But the sanctity of life movement came of age, I would say beginning foundationally with Francis Schaeffer and into the &#8217;80s but it wasn&#8217;t until Operation Rescue hit Atlanta and the pregnancy resource movement blossomed. Those two things, those two events led to a deepening of volunteerism through the churches, it brought Catholics and Protestants together in common cause, it developed friendships that became the basis for political action and activity, and then it translated into national policy, and as PAC director we know what we did here in Georgia and as soon as we made our decision to tighten the reins of the standard and the message and the underlying principle we began seeing political victory after political victory.        JD: So I&#8217;m just throwing something out that someone might ask. I&#8217;m not sure how to phrase this. Some person, perhaps, would question the recognition in 2007, 2008 to really start looking at this as a civil rights issue to get the black community to be on board. Someone would maybe ask, how does that relate to the moment around African American politics nationally with the rise of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party or how race politics are working at a national level? Was that part of the strategy or how does that fit in?        DB: All right. Keep in mind we&#8217;re isolated here. We&#8217;re not privy to the history of the pro-life movement going way back inrecent history and we are inventing things as we go because we don&#8217;t have support from national Right to Life. We don&#8217;t have support from AUL. They don&#8217;t agree with our no-rape-and-incest position; they think it&#8217;s harmful, even though we proved that it wasn&#8217;t. But it didn&#8217;t matter to us whether it was or it wasn&#8217;t; it was principle. Civil rights, when you ask the civil rights question, we&#8217;re in a culture in the Deep South that civil rights is central, depending on what communities you live in, small towns, so on and so forth. Did the human rights issue ever get linked directly to the sanctity of life issue? I can&#8217;t answer that question from the Catholic historical side; I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if it did. I don&#8217;t know that we did until we embraced the strategy of personhood, and it was personhood that we investigated and discovered that it was personhood within the black civil rights question that was central, that was the central issue in civil rights is personhood: When do rights attach? What rights are they? What are guaranteed? It&#8217;s not on the basis of the color of your skin but on the fact that you&#8217;re a human being. That is our argument in the sanctity of life that carries that protection all the way back to the beginning of creation of that human life.         So is it a human rights issue? Yes. Personhood helped us to focus on what the African American community experience for literally a hundred and twenty years, and that that issue was still alive and well today because rights aren&#8217;t attaching to human life, even at the elderly or the disabled. Rights are being removed, rights of personhood are being removed, on the basis of disability, infirmity, age, gender; I mean, where is the protection? So we see the sanctity of life movement in the twenty-first century as being a civil rights conclusion to the twentieth. And it wasn&#8217;t just blacks; it was Jews, it was women during the suffrage movement, it was Native Americans prior to that. All have felt being disenfranchised by the government on the basis of civil rights, so if our focus is now on human rights in the twenty-first century and we see, historically, how that&#8217;s affected the African American community and the Native American community through a eugenic policy, why wouldn&#8217;t we speak out on it? The two tie directly together. So it&#8217;s a conclusion of a process that was begun by the civil rights movement recently in the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s.          JD: Coming back to House Bill 529, who came up with the idea for it, how did you begin to draft it, who was consulted on it, what was the strategy for it?        DB: I came up with the idea in a conversation with Catherine Davis over proposed legislation. She was bemoaning the fact that we have a racial issue in Georgia still, and I said why don&#8217;t we pass a ban on any racially motivated abortion? Let&#8217;s ban black abortion in Georgia, because of what&#8217;s happening with the empirical data and the statistical analysis that shows there&#8217;s a disproportionate amount of blacks dying to the population, by double. It&#8217;s a hundred percent more, the increase, so let&#8217;s get that message out and let&#8217;s use a piece of legislation to do it. We were then informed that we needed to make it gender based as well as coercion based to cover a broad category and not just single out race.         JD: Who informed you of that?        DB: Our pro-life caucus, as a matter of political strategy.        JD: Okay. So there is a pro-life caucus of all the different groups coming together&#8212;        DB: Yes.        JD: &#8212;to try to at least know what each other&#8217;s doing.        DB: There&#8217;s a couple individuals at the Georgia capital that can always be counted on for counsel and strategy.        JD: So this is the pro-life caucus of legislators.        DB: Yes.        JD: Okay.         DB: And our problem is the House so we originate everything in the House because if you have a problem there you can just take it to the Senate and they&#8217;ll pass it, and then it comes back over to the House with more weight.         JD: Okay. So how long has the Senate been majority pro-life? Is there any effort to get that?        DB: Our pro-life majority came in two election cycles after we implemented the no rape and incest, and it&#8217;s only been building since then. We have a fifty-five percent majority. The lieutenant governor who runs the Senate, the Senate majority leader, and the Senate president pro tem are our strongest pro-life politicians, and before they were elected to office at those levels of influence, so they&#8217;ve been with us forever and now the top three are fully on board with us and they crack the whip. We&#8217;ve passed four bills in three years through the Senate; we&#8217;ve passed zero through the House.        JD: So in the next election cycle you guys are targeting the House.        DB: We are. We are.        JD: So House Bill 529 came into being from a conversation with Catherine Davis. I really do need to call her and set up an interview with her. I hope she&#8217;s available. [Laughs]         DB: She&#8217;d love it.        JD: She sounds so key and pivotal. So who became the major lobbyist for it, was it Catherine?        DB: We all did.        JD: You all did.        DB: We have a hired lobbyist, and the full-time lobbyist, myself, and Catherine and other volunteers. I mean there was no question; it was the most debated and controversial bill of 2009/2010, HB 529.        JD: Do you remember, what was the opposition or the prochoice response?        DB: I&#8217;m sorry, I said HB. It&#8217;s Senate Bill 529, Senate Bill.        JD: Yeah, because it came through the Senate and then&#8212;.        DB: Actually it came through the House and it passed committee in the House and was killed by the speaker in rules and then with minutes to spare we took it to the Senate and they passed it in record time, sixty legislative hours.         JD: Oh wow, okay.        DB: That was quick.        JD: So were you hitting the gun in terms of the last day to propose legislation?        DB: Yes.        JD: Okay.        DB: Yes, it was the last three minutes. It was wild.        JD: I told my students&#8212;. I taught classes this summer and I was like, &#8220;Does anybody know how a bill is passed?&#8221; In all my classes no one knew, and I was like, that&#8217;s okay. I didn&#8217;t really actually know how a bill was passed until I had to start doing this research. [Laughs] Then I found out every bill is scheduled somewhat different depending on the state legislature and then how things&#8212;.        DB: It got fast tracked and it passed in no time and was sent back over to the House where it passed hostile committees. It was a miracle. You can see it on tape. But the fact of the matter, we had testimony that women were coerced, that there was black targeting going on, and the most important piece of that bill&#8212;it was followed nationally.        JD: Yeah, it was.         DB: We had people in the pro-life caucus of the US House actually providing us cover, counsel, and support, calling down here trying to get the Speaker of the House to put it on the floor, because it had one very important poison pill for Planned Parenthood in it. It had a RICO statute that would have allowed us to prosecute Planned Parenthood in Georgia for killing African Americans disproportionately, for targeting them. We would have filed a court case and brought the data before the federal court that would then, because it&#8217;s a federal violation because federal funds were involved, it would then cross state line and we would be able to go national, and there were a ton of groups following that bill for that one point. If we could pass it then the RICO statute would allow us to turn the tables on the abortion industry and prove in federal court, bring our evidence and give it its day in court, let the court decide if the evidence displays the overwhelming fact that African Americans are being targeted, that gender is being used among the Asian community, overwhelmingly, for sex selection in abortion, which upsets the feminists because it&#8217;s the female babies that are being aborted in an Asian culture in preference to sons. So, you know, it&#8217;s a human rights issue, plain and simple, and we&#8217;re returning to our roots here and starting afresh with new battlegrounds.        JD: When we think of some of the big names, can you give me some names that you think of as key people? I know Catherine Davis is one; are there any other key names that you can think of over the history of&#8212;.        DB: In regard to what?        JD: Senate Bill 529.        DB: Mike Griffin, G-r-i-f-f-i-n. He was our state lobbyist and was up to his elbows in&#8212;        JD: Is he still around?        DB: &#8212;yeah, yeah&#8212;personal anecdotes and whatnot. He can tell you all about it. Trent Frank, Congressman Trent Frank up in Washington, D.C., Congressman from Arizona, Walter Webber of American Center for Law and Justice, that&#8217;s Jay Sekulow&#8217;s group out of DC. Walter Webber is a constitutional attorney, got a lot of Supreme Court experience. He helped craft it.        JD: With the RICO statute? Was he the one&#8212;?        DB: No, it was our own legislators, our own pro-life caucus that put the RICO statute in and Mark Crutcher of Life Dynamics out of Texas, that produced the Maafa 21 film, he was just salivating because Maafa 21 provides the legal [justification].        JD: What is Crutcher&#8217;s group called? You said out of Texas; what was the organization?        DB: Life Dynamics.        JD: Okay. I&#8217;ve seen some of their things.         DB: Matt Staver, out of Liberty Counsel. That&#8217;s Jerry Falwell&#8217;s law school, Liberty Counsel. We got special friends within the Catholic pro-life movement, Rob Muse of Thomas More Law Center, not society but center, Rob Muse, and a very famous law professor at&#8212;.Charles Rice, professor emeritus at Notre Dame.         JD: Okay, I was going to say is it Rice or not? [Laughs]        DB: Yeah, it&#8217;s Charles. Are you familiar with him?        JD: Mm hmm.        DB: Yeah, he&#8217;s a good friend and I appreciate his collaboration and help on personhood.         JD: He was an early person from the&#8217;60s on personhood, and he&#8217;s changed various strategies over the years in his articles for the Human Life Amendment, or the Human Life Review.        DB: Largely because they didn&#8217;t think it was achievable at a certain point, but Georgia&#8217;s reenergized the whole thing and what we&#8217;re seeing with Personhood USA, Mississippi, I don&#8217;t know if you realize it but in 2007 when we filed the state amendment it did receive national news and then Colorado immediately got the limelight because they got it on the ballot three months later. It was a high school student, home school student, Kristi Burton, who, when I was researching personhood and the Human Life Amendment, doing my research as vice president, contacted my friend in Alabama, John Eidsmoe, a constitutional attorney&#8212;John Eidsmoe, E-i-d-m-o-s-e, I think [Correct spelling is Eidsmoe].        JD: I would never have been able to spell that. [Laughs]        DB: He was Kristi&#8217;s professor of law and when I talked to him about a personhood state amendment he shared it with the class and she took it to Colorado and followed it up in Colorado and that started the ball rolling there in [19]88. Mexico picked up on it. Mexico now has passed a personhood amendment in nineteen states. If they pass it in two more it will become national law, and it&#8217;s being funded by some of the richest men in the world in Mexico. That funding is now accruing to the organization in the United States that&#8217;s promoting this.         JD: When did Personhood USA come into being?        DB: 1988. With the failure of the personhood amendment in Colorado under Kristi Burton they decided that an ongoing national organization needed to be formed. They contacted me and I helped them get some of the initial stuff together and I sit on their board now. They&#8217;ve gone international, Hungary, Poland, Mexico, Brazil, largely through the Catholic countries right now but that focus is coming back on America.        JD: What was the archdiocese of Atlanta or the Catholic Church&#8217;s response to Senate Bill 529? Were they on board? Were they sending their Catholic lobbyist in to help you?        DB: We had a major falling out on the last day of the session because they accepted a compromise that included rape and incest. None of our Georgia law in twelve years has a rape and incest clause and they were willing to compromise, and that would have opened the door for further compromise and justification for politicians to take a lesser road. We had worked hard to establish a high standard, we&#8217;d maintained it, and they came in and undermined and undercut it, and we had some pretty frank discussions on the last day&#8217;s session about their willingness to support a compromise to do evil. That has not been fully healed. We healed most of it in the 2011 legislative cycle and we worked very closely together on other legislation, but we took issue with them on that.         JD: Well I&#8217;m trying to think&#8212;. Oh, goodness. Is there anything you have to add? [Laughs] Sorry, this went longer. It&#8217;s already 3:00 and I have to be there at 3:30.        DB: Well, I mean if it were the history of the pro-life movement I could fill another hour with personhood, the paradigm shift that&#8217;s going on right now, and this to me eclipses anything within the African American connection. I mean that&#8217;s happening, but it&#8217;s happening because of personhood. The national group, which we&#8217;re very close to, and I can name all the national black leaders, adopted personhood as their main directive as a result of working with us and the fact that it is central to a human rights call. They see it as the last human rights issue, civil rights issue, of the twenty-first century. So we&#8217;re linked, we&#8217;re tied together at the hip. You probably got all those names within the pro-life African American community but Catherine can give them to you. She&#8217;s right up there with them, and Ryan is too.        JD: Sounds good. Well, I thank you so much for the interview today.        DB: Okay. You got Gen tomorrow.
