Evan Faulkenbury: Today is October 28, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m interviewing Darlene Parsons, who goes by Dee, for the Southern Oral History Program. So, Dee, the first question I have is for you to talk about your childhood and where you grew up.
Darlene Parsons: Okay. I grew up in Salem, Massachusetts. My father was the child of Russian immigrants and he couldn&#8217;t speak English until he started first grade. My grandparents&#8217; names are on the Ellis Island Memorial. My mother comes from, as she put it, a longstanding Yankee family in Danvers, Massachusetts, that used to be part of Salem, and they go back to the original governors of Massachusetts, and also I believe we may have the first Canadian deserter in our family. Much to my aunt&#8217;s dismay, who does my mother&#8217;s history, we found that a major ancestor of ours took off when the Revolutionary War started and settled in Nova Scotia and didn&#8217;t return till the late 1800s.   My father was very poor and he worked his way through medical school washing dishes and playing jazz trombone in an all-night bar. He then became a family doctor and decided to return to Salem to care for the immigrants in the Salem community. He was comfortable with that, having grown up there, and so his family practice was focused on immigrants who were low income and could not pay for doctors and had very long work hours in factories. So my father had evening office hours. He would visit them in their homes. He even delivered a few babies in their homes because they couldn&#8217;t afford that. He spoke fluent Russian, Polish, and Ukrainian, so all of those from that background would come to see him, but also other immigrant families trusted him. They knew he understood their situation, and so we had very close friends from Italian, French, Greek &#8211; our closest family friends were Greek &#8211; and about every day I would go out, open the front door of our house, and sitting on our front doorstep would be a fish that a fisherman had found, meals, Italian food. I grew up eating a wide variety of foods from all over the world, and that actually influenced me. To this day I love to eat all kinds of food.   My father used to tell me stories about how hard it was for him to go to school and not be able to speak English. He grew up in a Russian ghetto in Derby Street in Salem, Mass, and it was also at the time when people were beginning to be concerned about Russians, so he would be teased and called &#8220;commie&#8221; or &#8220;red,&#8221; and he wasn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s what they did. He never forgot that and he always instilled in me to look beyond what we see on the outside to what is on the inside. Salem is in the North Shore of Boston and our schools were integrated, so I grew up with students from all kinds of backgrounds, races, and so forth and enjoyed every last minute of it. I still remember walking to school with some friends and one gal was Polish, another one was Italian, and there was a guy who was Greek, and we used to call each other &#8211; this sounds strange &#8211; but they&#8217;d call me a &#8220;commie,&#8221; I would call them names. My girlfriend who was Polish used to tell us, as she put it, &#8220;Polak&#8221; jokes. We joked amongst ourselves with the jokes that perhaps touched on the pain that many of us had on being perceived as not really American but immigrant.  My father was Russian Orthodox but he primarily was Russian Orthodox to go to all the festivals, so we would go to the Russian festivals and dance the polka and eat all kinds of awesome foods. I still cook a lot of the Russian foods today. But as I grew older &#8211; and my mother was not religious, although she would send us to a Methodist church up the street for Sunday school, but neither one of them showed much interest in religion. I was a very curious teenager, and one time during an episode of Star Trek when I was seventeen years old it suddenly dawned on me that what I was looking for was the creator of the universe and, in a most unusual conversion story, I became a Christian while watching Star Trek. I didn&#8217;t know much about the God I was seeking but I realized that it was that God that was behind everyone exploring in space, and to this day I am an avid sci-fi buff and I want something about that on my tombstone, &#8220;Died a Star Trek fan,&#8221; or something like that. So even my conversion experience, up North, was highly unusual. When I made this conversion and attempted to do some reading I found the works of C. S. Lewis and so forth. I knew virtually no one in my extended family that believed the way that I was growing into believing. Over time I found my way into Park Street Church in Boston, again a very unusual church in that it was very open to all of the students in the Boston area. And we had students attending the church that came from all over the world, and again I had a very rich cultural experience that was not fundamentalist. None of us talked about: no drinking, no dancing. I grew up in a Russian family. One of the neatest things that a patient of my dad&#8217;s made for us every year was homemade raspberry wine from her raspberry bushes. I have yet to taste wine that was as good as that raspberry wine from that lady.   So I was not indoctrinated into having to believe the earth was six thousand years old, in fact none of my friends did, so we had a very broad perspective. We majored on the majors and we were grateful to find each other because up in New England you were a little bit odd if you considered yourself an &#8220;evangelical,&#8221; is the word I use now. Back then I just said I was a Christian who really believed it.   EF: Right.  DP: During that time I started attending&#8211;. I was going to college in New York at a small women&#8217;s college called Russell Sage and I received my bachelor&#8217;s in nursing, but I wanted to return to that area and actually became a visiting nurse in Salem. I was assigned, because I was the newbie &#8211; I was only twenty-one when I graduated &#8211; the tough section of Salem, and about fifty percent of my caseload involved child abuse and neglect follow-up. The visiting nurses in those days, in these smaller towns, often had contracts for the local government. So&#8211;.  EF: Would you mind if I pause you, to go back? I want to ask you much more about your nursing career and who you were working with, but you talked a lot about your father and I wanted you to go back and talk a bit more about your mother&#8211;  DP: Oh, sure.  EF: &#8211;and her family background as well.  DP: Okay. Well, she went along with my father. She was a woman of her day. She was a stay-at-home mom and if my dad went to the Russian festivals she went to the Russian festivals. My father was definitely the dominant one in our family. She, however, was a nurturer and as I grew up I felt&#8211;. My mother was the one who hugged us, made sure that she was at the events that needed to be at, because sometimes my dad was off delivering a baby in someone&#8217;s house. She was very close to her sister and her brother, and my great-grandmother I knew. She lived until her late nineties, and my grandmother lived to 103 [years old], so I knew them as well growing up, so they were very much a part of my life. But there was some conflict. They didn&#8217;t think much of my mother marrying a Russian, so there was bickering between those two sides all those years growing up. I still remember, when my dad passed away ten years ago, my grandmother marching into his funeral, and she said, &#8220;I outlived him.&#8221; [Laughs] That&#8217;s what she said, and she passed away about a year after that. But, I don&#8217;t know. It was actually funny. I actually think deep down inside they liked each other, even though they went at each other all the time.  EF: Sure.  DP: Who knows? She did go and get her medical care from my dad sometimes, so&#8211;  EF: Well.   DP: &#8211;it couldn&#8217;t have been that bad.  EF: That&#8217;s a sign. [Laughs]  DP: Yeah.    EF: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more&#8211;. You said that your parents loosely attended and had you attend a Methodist church?  DP: My father would bring me whenever he would go to the Russian Orthodox Church,&#8211;  EF: Right, okay.  DP: &#8211;which was very rare, and I would go for the Easter processionals and so forth.  EF: Right.  DP: My mother grew up generic Protestant so she felt we should see that side of things, so on Sunday morning she would bring my brother and I and leave us in the Sunday school program. She&#8217;d go get herself a cup of coffee. We&#8217;d sit through the Sunday school and then come back out. My brother, when he hit his teenage years, totally rejected it but for some reason I was always drawn, both to the Methodist Church and to the Russian Orthodox Church. There was something inside me that drew comfort from both of those.  EF: Sure. And then you mentioned a Star Trek conversion experience. [Laughs].  DP: I bet that&#8217;s the first and last you&#8217;ll hear.   EF: It&#8217;s so interesting. I wonder if, maybe rewind a little bit and describe what led up to that, I mean what &#8211; because you said it wasn&#8217;t on your mind a whole lot, these evangelical principles.  DP: We didn&#8217;t know anybody.   EF: Yeah.  DP: I had nobody, except around that time a couple from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary&#8211;  EF: Yeah, in Boston?  DP: &#8211;came&#8211;. Yeah. They came to our youth group and they would&#8211;. I really didn&#8217;t get what they were saying most of the time. I really enjoyed being with a few friends there, but somehow it must have had an impact that I didn&#8217;t understand. I also, when I was sixteen, decided I was going to, quote, read through the whole Bible. [I] made it through Deuteronomy and I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore, so that was that.  But I again was drawn to it, and then my mother and father actually went to see Billy Graham when he was in Madison Square Garden and they mentioned it to me a few times, and my dad had enormous respect for Billy Graham. He didn&#8217;t believe what Billy Graham believed but he had enormous respect for him.  EF: Right.  DP: So occasionally they would turn on a crusade on television and I would watch it through and see people going forward and I would hear more about Jesus, and Billy Graham often&#8211;. He preached a gospel that was very loving and that&#8217;s what attracted my mother and father to him. And actually six weeks before my father died he asked me to help him pray that he would be a Christian. He asked me if it was too late and I said no. My daughter was with me when it happened. My mother, still to this day&#8211;. She remarried a wonderful Jewish man who also is atheist and she doesn&#8217;t like me talking about it. [Laughs] So, you know.   But what happened is during that time there were articles about the Jesus Movement in newspapers, and I always read magazines. I was reading Time magazine at a very young age.   EF: Sure.  DP: So I still remember one of the Jesus Movement people saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s not a religion, it&#8217;s a relationship,&#8221; and for some reason that phrase stuck with me. So when I was watching Star Trek that night I was putting two and two together that I was curious about how this whole universe got started, and then that phrase, &#8220;It&#8217;s not a religion, it&#8217;s a relationship.&#8221; And so it was a God that created this massive universe who actually gave a hoot about me, and I said, &#8220;I believe.&#8221; I still remember saying, &#8220;I believe,&#8221; and no one had me pray a sentence prayer, told me I had to do these steps or anything like that. At that moment, I believed, and the following week I went to my youth group meeting and they were reading from I John 1, and as usual nobody had any insight. They said, &#8220;Any insight?&#8221; and we would all sit there, but [that time] I raised my hand. I said, &#8220;Well, let me tell you all about this dark stuff. I always felt like I was in the darkness but now I&#8217;m beginning to see something, a little light. I actually think that I&#8217;m moving into that light that I John 1 is talking about,&#8221; and the two of them looked at each other and they said, &#8220;Did something happen this week?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, the strangest thing during Star Trek.&#8221; And that&#8217;s that part of the story.   EF: That&#8217;s really interesting.   DP: And unique.   EF: Yeah, definitely.   DP: No one believes me when I tell them that I became a Christian during Star Trek but I did.   EF: I believe you.  DP: Thank you.   EF: Well, in the same point in your life, can you tell me a little bit more about your education?  DP: Sure.  EF: You said you went to an integrated school and you had a lot of friends from different&#8211;  DP: Yes.  EF: &#8211;ethnicities. Could you elaborate a little bit more on your schooling?  DP: Yeah. I was in a public school. My father was a great believer in public school education and so we were sent to the local schools, and I walked to school every morning and even through high school walked to school as well. So, back in Salem in those days, I went K through eight at the Bowditch School, which was named after Nathaniel Bowditch, and then I went my last four years to Salem High School, whose mascot is the witch.   EF: Of course. [Laughs] The Salem Witches.  DP: Yes, you got it.   EF:  Great. And then you went off to college, right after graduating from high school?  DP: Mm hmm.  EF: And you mentioned the college. Russell Sage?  DP: Russell Sage. It&#8217;s a small women&#8217;s college, and why I chose that I&#8217;m still not sure. I read the brochures about it. I was accepted at Simmons and Skidmore but I liked the nursing program. It didn&#8217;t require me &#8211; isn&#8217;t this awful? &#8211; to go summers. I wanted my summers off so I went there, and I got a very good education but wanted to return. That was in Troy, New York.   EF: Okay.  DP: The brother school was RPI, Rensselaer Polytechnic, but I wanted to come back to Massachusetts. I loved the Boston area at that time in my life.  EF: Sure. And what was Russell Sage like? I guess you spent four years there.  DP: Yes.  EF: What was the environment like?  DP: Again few Christians, evangelicals, but there were a few of us, about six of us, and we would get together and pray for one another, and I still remember. We&#8217;d set up a book table and people could take books free of charge, different books like something written by Billy Graham, and I still remember one time&#8211;. That was back in the days of the Children of God. They were this real nutty cult group and they invaded our cafeteria one day and a bunch of the ladies went up and basically threw them out, saying, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got our Christians here. We don&#8217;t need you.&#8221; And I remember sitting there laughing, and they came back and sat down and they said, &#8220;You guys aren&#8217;t weird like them, so let&#8217;s keep it to you guys.&#8221;  I had a Russian history professor who I absolutely adored and I took a number of history courses, not only Russian history but other history from him, and he was very respectful about my beliefs. He also got a kick that I grew up in Salem and they had some minutemen come to the school to do like a marching deal, and he picked me to be the one to fire off the musket, and I&#8217;ll never forget it because it kicked back and I fell backwards and he actually caught me.  EF: Oh, no.   DP: He knew that was going to happen. But he encouraged me, because I loved history and I actually thought about switching, and at that time it was very difficult, the job market wasn&#8217;t good, and he said, &#8220;Look, you can always do history.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Be a nurse. You&#8217;ll be able to earn money and then you can decide what you want to do from there,&#8221; but he was very supportive of me. Again, he was Jewish in background and we had some wonderful talks, respectful talks where we weren&#8217;t going at each other exploring what we believed, and this is something that has meant a lot to me through the years, is being able to talk to people. I respect everybody that I meet, I love their backgrounds, and I&#8217;m not here to try to convert anybody. Heck, I became a Christian during Star Trek without anybody beating down my head. My goal is merely to share and understand other people and I&#8217;ve been like that, intensely curious about people.  EF: Right, like a good historian.   DP: I guess so.   EF: Well, on that same vein, when you&#8217;re at Russell Sage and you&#8217;re part of the small Christian group, one of the questions I wanted to ask was when did you start becoming active, whether it was politically or religiously, more publicly active and in what ways?  DP: Well &#8211; and it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m not now &#8211; I actually was appointed by my mayor in Salem to serve on the drug advisory committee and I was active in Democratic politics until Ronald Reagan ran for the presidency, and at that point I became a Republican but I was never fully satisfied with the Republican label, and I&#8217;ll get into that later. I spent two years on the Navajo Indian reservation, which really affected me.   So for a while I was actively involved in Republican politics but I found that I was tired of it, people fighting with one another and if you didn&#8217;t follow the party line on everything you were somehow suspect, and I found that actually on the Democrat side as well because I agreed with some of the Democrats and I agreed with some of the Republicans. So, I will admit that I was the president of the Triangle Republican Women back in the mid [19]80s, but it was right after that that I dropped out of politics and I decided it wasn&#8217;t for me. It&#8217;s so embarrassing to talk about that. [Laughs]  EF: Oh, no. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed. This is fascinating information, and it&#8217;s in some ways refreshing to hear these different stories, not glued to partisan politics, so I definitely want to know more. Maybe before I start talking more again about politics, you mentioned working for two years with the Navajo, and that was a part of you being a public health nurse, right?  DP: What it was is I met my husband at Park Street Church in Boston.  EF: And this is after you&#8217;d graduated from college.  DP: I&#8217;d graduated and I am working now as a visiting nurse.  EF: I see.  DP: I also did discharge planning for a while for a large hospital in Boston. But my husband was a medical student at Dartmouth and we met at Park Street Church, and he also came from a family&#8211;. His father was an alcoholic who eventually achieved sobriety, but not until he lost his job at the Mass College of Pharmacy. He was a dean there. My husband was very interested in substance abuse, obviously, and my father actually was a chief of staff at an alcoholic hospital as well in the North Shore of Boston, so we met through those circles. He had two years of his&#8211;. His dad was drinking heavily and couldn&#8217;t, he suddenly called him one day and said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t pay for your last two years of med school. You&#8217;re on your own.&#8221; My husband joined the National Health Service Corps program which paid for two years of his medical school education in return for two years in an underserved area.   He was a little confused as to what he wanted to do in medicine and decided to do his two years after his one-year internship at Brown University in Rhode Island, and we decided to go with the Indian Health Service, and in particular with the Navajo tribe because we heard they were the most cultural intact tribe in the US. I applied for a job. My Navajo friends used to call me&#8211;. I was the minority hire of the Navajo tribe, and I set up a home health agency but it&#8217;s very different out there.   EF: Where exactly was it?  DP: Well, the Navajo Indian Reservation is&#8211;. I was actually in their central office in Window Rock, Arizona. We lived in Gallup, New Mexico.  EF: Okay.  DP: My husband was at the tertiary care Gallup Indian Medical Center. I covered the entire Navajo reservation, which encompasses New Mexico, Arizona, and a couple of spokes up into Colorado and Utah. They had received a Department of Aging grant to set up follow-up. Now, Navajos don&#8217;t live together like this. They believe their home is their land. Their home is not their little hogan; the hogan is merely a shelter for them. So they don&#8217;t live in community and they sheep-herd, and there are many elderly people who are brought along in sheep herding who need care. There&#8217;s terrible incidence of diabetes. So my goal was to try to set up a system where I could take Navajo people from the community and train them in basic healthcare and have them follow up and find them when they were herding sheep. It was an amazing experience because if I wanted to go find John Begay &#8211; &#8220;Begay&#8221; is like &#8220;Smith&#8221; &#8211; I would be given directions, &#8220;Well, you get off 40 and onto the dirt road, and then the dirt road will go away, and then you continue heading south until the buttes look more separate, and then you need to go east for about five miles and then start looking for some sheep.&#8221;   EF: Wow.  DP: That&#8217;s how we found people on the reservation, and it was an incredibly culturally rich experience, and they trusted me. I was given standing orders so I could treat them immediately, no matter what I found out there. Besides setting up the program I would find people in diabetic comas, and you can&#8217;t get back into civilization. It&#8217;s forty-five miles away, often over desert conditions, high desert. Early on I realized that I would have to downplay who I was as a privileged, white girl from the East, and they asked me to give a talk the first month I was there and I decided&#8211;. And the Navajos have the most incredible sense of humor but you can&#8217;t tell, because they keep their face&#8211;. [Demonstrates]  EF: Oh, really?  DP: And you have to listen and you suddenly realize that they&#8217;re pulling your leg. They love to tell a joke at the start of all of their meetings, and [I wanted to] take a chance so I told the following joke, I said, &#8220;Tonto and the Lone Ranger were galloping across the high desert over near Chinle,&#8221; and they&#8217;re looking at me because the Lone Ranger and Tonto of course are very stereotyped.  EF: Of course, yeah.  DP: So they&#8217;re looking at me, and I said, &#8220;And suddenly they looked to the north and on the butte were great numbers of Navajo warriors on their horses, obviously getting ready to attack, and they looked to the east, the west, the south, surrounded by great Navajo warriors. The Lone Ranger looked at Tonto and said, &#8216;It looks like we&#8217;ve reached the end of the road,&#8217; and Tonto looked at him and said, &#8216;What do you mean, &#8220;we,&#8221; Pale Face?&#8217;&#8221; And they loved that and, to the day I left, if they saw me I&#8217;d get hit on the back and say, &#8220;What do you mean &#8216;we,&#8217; Pale Face,&#8221; and that joke stuck with them because they understood that I could make fun of myself and who I was, and I was very, very accepted. They gave me a Navajo name. They made me a traditional Navajo outfit, which I still have and cherish, and it was again a rich cultural experience where I felt very much included, and again my faith was there but I never&#8211;. They knew that I was a Christian but they knew I was there to support them in their rituals, and I even attended a Christian Reformed church on the reservation that was also attended by the president of the Navajo tribe, and half of the service was in English and half was in Navajo. So even within my faith I was able to get a very rich cultural experience, and I actually didn&#8217;t want to leave. I cried all the way through Albuquerque, heading back east with my husband to finish his training.  EF: Right. So two years there in the Navajo Nation and then back east, and then you continued to work as a public health nurse?  DP: At night I was somewhat bored on the reservation and I ended up &#8211; this is so typical of me &#8211; [saying to myself] &#8220;How does money work? When the Federal Reserve says they&#8217;re releasing money into the system, what are they talking about?&#8221; So, I signed up at the local Navajo community college. I took a course in macroeconomics. Then I took a course in microeconomics and I said, &#8220;Oh, this is interesting.&#8221;   So, we went back. I got a job as an evening visiting nurse supervisor, which was a trip in itself; lots of things happen in cities at night.   EF: Sure.   DP:  I also applied and was accepted to the executive MBA program at the University of Rochester, was the first nurse to go through that program and one of the few women. There were only four women in my class that long time ago. Things were different.   EF: Right.  DP: So, anyway, those two years were very full, doing that. Then my husband knew immediately that&#8211;. He had decided he wanted to be a cardiologist and he was accepted our first year back for his fellowship in cardiology at Duke, so we knew we were going to move south. By that point I had grown so much in love with warmer weather in New Mexico I didn&#8217;t want to live north anymore, so we were very excited and we moved down here and integrated and fell in love with North Carolina.   EF: And about what year was that that you moved down here?  DP: Let&#8217;s see; 1984.   EF: Okay. Gotcha.   DP: Yeah, that&#8217;s right.   EF: And then, again before I start talking more about religious and political topics, I noticed on your bio that you worked with Glaxo for a while. Was that here in North Carolina?  DP: Yes. So I got my MBA and went to work for Glaxo in this liaison position between marketing and medical studies and realized that I hated working for a corporation. It was not me and, remember, I used to be out there roaming the reservation and suddenly, I was in a cubicle. Yeah, I got to travel to check everybody&#8217;s studies that were going on, but I hated it, and in fact I was in the process of looking at how to get out of it and I found out I was pregnant.   EF: Ah.   DP: And it gave me a perfect exit.    EF: And that was after you had finished your MBA, you said, right?  DP: Yes, and I worked two years for Glaxo.  EF: Okay. I see.  DP: Then I&#8211;.  EF: Can I ask &#8211; sorry for interrupting.  DP: Please.  EF: I should have asked when you were on the topic, but you say you were one of the few women going through the MBA program at the University of Rochester. Did you experience sexism from the campus?  DP: Not at all, although my best buddy was the only African American in the program and we used to sit next to each other in class, and the two of us would hoot because whenever they wanted to get a picture of the &#8220;typical&#8221; MBA class they would walk in the class, and my friend, Lance, would go, &#8220;Oh, no. They&#8217;re going to take another picture of us for the brochure,&#8221; like this is typical, the two of us. So, no; in fact we were very welcome, and we were in a study group with two other guys who were great, and did not sense sexism at all. But again, remember, we&#8217;re way up north.  EF: Right.   DP: Rochester, New York is not Birmingham, Alabama.  EF: Right, absolutely.  DP: Yeah.  EF: Well, great. So you&#8217;re in North Carolina in about 1984, I think is what you said, and then you said in the mid-1980s you started working for &#8211; or you were the club president for the Republican women of the Triangle, so I wonder if you can trace your political evolution a little bit.   DP: Well, I&#8217;ll tell you one funny thing. I got involved when I was in New Mexico on the reservation. There was the Cowboy Coalition, which was more conservative people who lived out in the sticks of New Mexico, and there were actually a fair number of Navajos who were involved in the Cowboy Coalition, again not as traditional conservative politics as you might imagine. But I got involved with that and actually went&#8211;. It was really a hoot. I went to a gathering that they had and the Navajos were making Navajo tacos &#8211; that were in our group &#8211; and they even had &#8211; and I still to this day have major, like a cultural weird feeling &#8211; they had a Polish band playing in the background.  EF: Wow.   DP: And Jeff Bingaman &#8211; I think he said Bingaman. He was the astronaut, he went to the moon, and he actually came out to speak during that time as well. So here I am, out on the reservation, eating Navajo tacos, listening to a Polish band, and there&#8217;s an astronaut who served in the Senate &#8211; he just served one term &#8211; but he was very well-liked by the Navajo people because he really pushed for giving the Navajo back control over healthcare and stuff like that. So I was again a very confused Republican because I assumed that there were many Republicans like me who felt that we had terribly treated our Native Americans [that I looked at] in those two years as my brothers and sisters &#8211; they adopted me into a clan and so forth &#8211; so I always had very&#8211;. I always felt we needed to give the Navajos, and all Native Americans, back more land, give them more money to develop their industries and so forth, so I assumed, because there was this one Republican guy who was into this, that this was a viewpoint that was shared by many conservatives. And also, remember, I&#8217;m from up north&#8211;  EF: Right.  DP: -and so what is conservative up north is not what is conservative down in Alabama.   So, I got involved with the Triangle Republican Women when I got back here, for something else to do. My husband had very long hours as a fellow, I was working a nine-to-five for Glaxo, so I thought, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll get involved with them.&#8221; They asked me to give some talks about my time on the Navajo reservation and eventually they asked if I would be the president of the group. And it was during the time I was president, and it was a very interesting moment for me, I was sitting at a barbecue place that no longer exists, in Durham. We decided to have a dinner meeting and we were eating barbecue and several of the people, who I knew to be Christians, started insulting other Republicans who didn&#8217;t hold to their particular denominational doctrinal beliefs, and it was like this light clicked, went off in me, and I remember I looked at all of them, and I said, &#8220;This is not a Bible study. We are to embrace all of those who share or can share with us certain ideals, and if you want a Bible study and you want to beat people over the head with the Bible, do it at church,&#8221; and they were not happy.   I could tell, they were not happy with me, but it was at that moment I realized this isn&#8217;t the way I want to live out my life. In other words, politics is not the answer for me. I have other things that concern me and I&#8217;m concerned actually within the church with issues, and I believed very strongly that God tells us to get our acts together inside the church and that we are not supposed to be pointing our fingers outside the church. If we believe that we are Christians and that God helps us to change or see things his way, why are we blaming people outside the church when they don&#8217;t? It bothered me deeply because I wanted to have dialogue with people outside of the church. I didn&#8217;t want to beat them over the head on whatever the current theology de jure was. That wasn&#8217;t my deal. Let&#8217;s be ourselves up inside the church and let&#8217;s be loving and open to those outside.  EF: Right.  DP: So, it was basically that journey into politics that helped me to see that I&#8217;m not going to change people that way, or affect people&#8217;s lives that way, and certainly very few people were as interested as I was in Native American politics&#8211;   EF: Right, sure.  DP: &#8211;back here in the east, so I was a fish out of water.  EF: I see. And did any of it also have to do with &#8211; because you also mentioned Ronald Reagan earlier &#8211; did your movement away more from the political sphere have anything to do with more national Republican politics? Like were you still on board with a lot of the political opinions, or were you in the middle?  DP: Because I got my MBA I actually am a supporter of a more free market system. I believe that more people go to get work when the market is allowed to flourish; however, I also believe that there are people who are disenfranchised and let down by the system. So, how I evolved in this was I did &#8211; and I also did appreciate &#8211; and again, understand that I come from a Russian immigrant background &#8211; Ronald Reagan&#8217;s stand against Gorbachev and the Berlin Wall. My father had taken me. I&#8217;ve been to Russia three times. I&#8217;ve even taken the Trans-Siberian Railroad, [and my father] told me most likely many of our relatives were conscripted to build that railroad. I believe that my grandparents left looking for more freedom.   So a lot of my attraction to Ronald Reagan was his stand against communism and what I considered the persecution of the people within Russia. I had a number of friends who were Cuban who were very upset with Fidel Castro and believed that he could be a danger. So, understand that a lot of it had to do with a big picture where I saw Ronald Reagan, to me, going for that. And, by the way, that&#8217;s why, John F. Kennedy &#8211; my father worshiped John F. Kennedy and he made a stand against communism as well, and so I have a great deal of respect. But, see, what I was finding was there were big pictures that I was supporting but there were some other things underneath that were not being dealt with that bothered me.  EF: Right, right. So your focus became less on politics and more church, religious-based. Can you talk about how that became more of a priority for you while in North Carolina?  DP: Well, we&#8217;re going to have to go, while in North Carolina, to Dallas, Texas. Let me tell you what happened.  EF: Sure.  DP: My second daughter was born and my husband had a grant from the NIH, and a group of people from Duke went to UT Southwest Medical Center. It has the largest gathering of Nobel prizewinners in medicine and about ten doctors from Duke &#8211; my husband was on faculty at that time &#8211; decided to go to Dallas. I was not thrilled but my husband promised me it would be two to three years but, as I always said, God had a little different plan in mind. So what happened is I stayed home with my daughter, my second daughter came along very quickly; they were twenty-one months apart. We went to Texas and just as soon as we got to Texas I found out I was pregnant with my third, who would be my son, Will, and a few months after that my daughter, Abby, who was turning three years old, was diagnosed with a massive malignant brain tumor and we were given less than a ten percent chance of her survival. It was bad. We called all of our friends around the country, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins and other places, and we were told to stay put, right where we were, at Neurosurgeons for Children, which was twenty minutes from my house. They were very well known for radical surgeries that were separating conjoined twins. People came from all over the world and they were there.  EF: And this is Dallas.  DP: Yeah, twenty minutes from where I lived, so there was no question in my mind that we were going to stay there, and I wanted one surgeon who was going off the service, but I told him I didn&#8217;t care if he was going off the service; he was going to operate on my daughter. My [daughter&#8217;s first] surgery was fifteen hours long and she bled tremendously, which is not a good sign. It means the tumor has developed its own blood supply, and my husband and I, having a medical background, knew we were in terrible problems, terrible straits.   So her tumor returned immediately and they decided to induce me to have my son because I was so stressed out. I mean, how do you calm down when this happens? So I had my son and then she went in for her second surgery. During the surgery the neurosurgeon thought he had gotten it all. Thankfully it was not a metastatic tumor but it was a highly malignant tumor; it just doesn&#8217;t send seeds off. He thought he got it all because the cold sections and the margins were clear, but two days after surgery we found out that there was still some tumor.   So we needed to stay there, and we had to make a very difficult decision at that point. Some of the doctors wanted to radiate her. She&#8217;s three years old. A child who&#8217;s radiated with a deep brain tumor is guaranteed serious mental retardation. There&#8217;s no question. I mean they tried to put it in nice terms but my husband and I aren&#8217;t stupid and we understood. So we thought we were going to lose our daughter, and we thought why would we put her through hell for her last days on this earth where she would become confused, sick, and most likely nonfunctional. So we made a decision to not radiate her. It was supported by two members of the team &#8211; by now we&#8217;ve got this massive team overlooking her &#8211; and it was not supported by many other members of the team, and my husband was hauled into his chief&#8217;s office and he said, &#8220;Are you not radiating her because you&#8217;re Christians?&#8221; and my husband said, &#8220;No. We are not radiating her because we don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the wisest decision at this point,&#8221; and he said &#8211; the tumor was still pretty high in the brain, the part that was there &#8211; &#8220;We would ask you to consider a third surgery and at that point, if it grows back, we will consider radiation at that point.&#8221;   Well, fast forward: she&#8217;s a nurse now at the Duke surgical trauma intensive care unit.  EF: Wow.  DP: The tumor was residual tumor, residual tumor, residual tumor on every MRI, waiting for it to grow, waiting for it to grow, waiting for it to grow, and it never did. At the end of the ordeal&#8211;. So we were there for ten years. My husband, at that point, left academics because we had terrible bills and went into practice so we could give her the type of care, even if we had to travel, that we wanted her to have.   So what happened was, had we radiated her, she would have survived but she would have been severely impaired. The fact that we didn&#8217;t radiate her, actually it was written about, our decision on this, and they have actually re-looked at some of their boilerplate decisions on radiation therapy in young children. My daughter was seen recently at the Duke brain tumor clinic &#8211; she needs to be followed every couple years &#8211; and the head of the clinic came in and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you made that decision but we all applauded you in rounds this morning.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m still flaming neurotic over the whole thing.&#8221;   EF:  Wow.  DP: Totally neurotic. But again&#8211;.  EF: Yeah, what an ordeal.   DP: What an ordeal, and to have people looking at us cross-eyed, thinking we were making this decision because we were evangelicals and we were going to pray away the cancer, we never&#8211;. Look, I have been a visiting nurse; I saw many people die who prayed. I don&#8217;t look at God as guaranteeing us healing; I look at him as guaranteeing us he&#8217;ll walk with us, and so I never&#8211;. I didn&#8217;t know what God had in store for me. I just wanted him to walk with me and hold onto me so that I could be a good mother to three children in a town where I knew no one.   EF: Wow. Thanks for sharing. That was really something. Wow. Any follow-up question after that is like a downward spiral.   DP: Well, and that&#8217;s when I got&#8211;. Let me bring you back. So,&#8211;  EF: Please do.  DP: &#8211;you asked about me getting involved in church,&#8211;  EF: Yes, right.  DP: &#8211;and so we&#8211;. Our first church, which was Ed Young, Jr&#8217;s church,  and, if you read about him, he&#8217;s a Southern Baptist prosperity gospel guy.  EF: What&#8217;s his name again?  DP: Ed Young, Jr.  EF: Okay. Where is he based?  DP: He runs Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Texas.  EF: Oh, okay, yeah.  DP: That was not our style: big church, big music, everything flowing; it was a little too perfect. He lived in our neighborhood. He was nice to us when our daughter got sick but his style wasn&#8217;t our style.   Once my daughter semi-stabilized we found Pete Briscoe&#8217;s church, Bent Tree Bible Fellowship, and Pete, who is evangelical, has a very high view of women in the church and he actually has an associate pastor who is a woman, and his [parents], Stuart and Jill Briscoe, Jill has preached all over the world. I had always loved history and I would sit in some Bible studies I attended and I said, &#8220;Did you know about this? Did you know about that?&#8221; and Pete called me one day and said, &#8220;We have a lot of people coming in from a Catholic background and not many of them understand about Martin Luther and all that stuff.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Can you do like a course on the Reformation?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Me, alone?&#8221; and he said yeah, and he said, &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Is anybody going to have trouble that I&#8217;m a woman doing this?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Oh, I need to have a talk with you.&#8221; He talked to me and I ended up developing a two-year course on church history and put it all together and taught it, and it was extremely well attended and I didn&#8217;t have any problems. No one seemed to mind. A guy joined in with me, not to help me because I&#8217;m a woman, but he actually writes history books and so he got a kick out of my class so he started helping me teach. So, the day we left Dallas to come back, Pete came up to me and he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever let anybody tell you that as a woman you can&#8217;t teach or preach. Don&#8217;t let them do that to you,&#8221; and I&#8217;ll never forget that.   EF: Yeah, sure. So what became your church home in this area, in North Carolina?  DP: We decided to come back. My daughter, who was so sick, her middle name is Caroline. Our goal had been to stay there two to three years and head back here.  EF: Sure.   DP: So finally they told us that she was a most-likely cure and we said&#8211;. My husband called me, I&#8217;ll never forget it, and he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m standing here on the tenth floor of Baylor Hospital and I&#8217;m trying to figure out why are we still here in Dallas? You want to go back?&#8221; That was in March, and on July 17 I was sitting in a house in Raleigh. It upset our kids terribly, because we&#8217;d been in Texas. That&#8217;s what they knew. They cried all the way across the country. I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry. You&#8217;ll love it here,&#8221; and they all love it here, by the way, now, but they weren&#8217;t too happy.   So, we needed some support when our kids were very &#8211; when my daughter was so sick. So we sent our kids to a very large Christian school, that wasn&#8217;t fundamentalist, in Dallas, and my kids liked the environment so we decided that&#8211;. When we made the choice to move back across country, they were so upset we said, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;ll find a place for you that&#8217;s roughly similar to what you&#8217;re in and you&#8217;ll at least feel comfortable in it.&#8221; Although, by the way, we chose the Christian school primarily because we were under such stress. We needed all the support we could get. I am very supportive of public schools, parochial schools, home school; I don&#8217;t care, whatever works for your family. That&#8217;s my deal on it, so this is not like some sort of doctrinal thing.  EF: Okay.   DP: So we got them into North Raleigh Christian Academy and all three of them ended up graduating from there, and it was good. But that&#8217;s when we began to see more of the South, because at Pete Briscoe&#8217;s church nobody ever talked about Young Earth creationism.  We just didn&#8217;t.  EF: Sure.  DP: Well, at the school, people talked about it, and then my kids wanted to go to church where all their friends were, and so we started attending Providence Baptist Church, which is a Southern Baptist church. The pastor was nice enough and so forth, they had a good youth program, but the first thing that happened is we were asked to teach a Sunday school class so we started our&#8211;. We got another guy, my husband, myself, and this other guy, and we worked our way through my church history deal that I had put together. Then we decided to work our way through a systematic theology book and we came to creationism, and I knew that there were a couple of people in the class that were Young Earth creationists. So I said, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;re going to have a nice debate, and I&#8217;m going to let the Young Earthers do their debate and my husband and I, we&#8217;re more like Francis Collins, theistic evolutionists. And everybody&#8217;s going to get equal time, and we want to show how we can all get together and not make this a major issue.&#8221; Oh, my gosh, that was&#8211;. And somebody came up to me and said, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to go well,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Why? We&#8217;re open and we&#8217;re going to let everybody have their say,&#8221; and they said, &#8220;You watch.&#8221; In fact it&#8217;s the guy who helps me with my blog on the technical issues stuff now. And, all hell broke loose.
EF: Wow.
DP: We had the debate. We had some Young Earth creationists&#8217; group show up in our Sunday school class, they were causing a ruckus, interrupting us and so forth, and I went to the pastor with my husband and I said, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; We did not know this: he was an ardent Young Earther and he had it taught to the kids every year, and to the grownups, six weeks a year, on Young Earth creationism. And I said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell us before we joined the church? I would never have stepped in here and stepped on a hornets&#8217; nest. We wouldn&#8217;t have come to your church.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t put it in there so people will come to the church.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Great, and then we&#8217;re stuck with this.&#8221;   But people begged us to stay, because my husband said, &#8220;We got to get out of here,&#8221; and they begged us to stay. So for our class, we had about fifty people, and I actually made some wonderful friends, [and] we still get together now because we&#8217;ve all left the church. What happened is what caused all this to happen. I was becoming more and more concerned about some of the hard-line, what I call secondary doctrine, stuff that I was seeing.
EF: Sure.
DP: In the meantime I had gone through a faith crisis of my own, questioning what it was I believed and why I believed it, and I spent five years reading books. I&#8217;ve read all of Dawkins, Hitchens. By the way, Christopher Hitchens is my secret vice. I love Christopher Hitchens&#8217; writings.  I don&#8217;t agree with him but I loved him, and I spent five years slightly interacting but reading at ExChristian.net. I wanted to understand, not have it flour-coated, why people leave the faith. Why do they hate it? What are their questions, and when they have those questions I spent time reading and finding answers to those questions, because I wasn&#8217;t going to continue on in a faith where I couldn&#8217;t get my questions answered. So my faith was becoming more and more strong as I sought, and I also became more comfortable with a little doubt on the edges, because all of us doubt, and I also believe God&#8217;s big enough to handle our doubt.   So what happened was a woman came to my house and said, &#8220;I need to tell you a story.&#8221; She said, &#8220;My son&#8211;.&#8221; We had heard that a pedophile who was associated with Providence Baptist had been arrested &#8211; and by the way he&#8217;s serving thirteen years &#8211; and that he had molested a fair number of young teen boys, and he had been a volunteer [from the] seminary and he worked with all the youth.
EF: The seminary in Raleigh?
DP: Yeah, Southeastern Seminary. I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8211;.
EF: Oh, that&#8217;s okay.
DP: Assume Southeastern when I talk about more fundamentalism, alright?
EF: Okay, got it.
DP: That might help.
EF:  Sure.
DP: He molested kids, and I found out how bad, and I wanted to tell you that, as a nurse who had worked with child sex abuse victims, this was amongst some of the worst sexual abuse I have ever heard in my life. I can&#8217;t even speak of it, it makes me so sick. This young man, who was fourteen at the time, and his name is Aaron &#8211; he&#8217;s very out about his name &#8211; was at a summer camp and the guy, he was in a cabin with him, and the guy &#8211; and forgive me if this is X-rated &#8211; was encouraging them to do circle masturbation. He was shocked. He&#8217;s fourteen years old. He went to the pastors and told them this, this is a year before the arrest, and they decided not to believe him. They said he was exaggerating and that this seminary student &#8211; Doug Goodrich, he was in the news &#8211; that Doug said, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s locker room humor. This is what we were doing and he&#8217;s exaggerating it.&#8221; His parents came in and met with them and they ignored it and, not only then, but then he was actually put on probation for six weeks, the parents weren&#8217;t told, because he was taking them to some pretty explicit R-rated movies and a parent discovered it. So they told the church that he was taking a six-week sabbatical to help care of his sick mother but in fact it was due to that. He came back and he was escalating, and it was a policeman&#8211;. He took a kid after church to a park and was molesting him in a car and was found by a policeman, so we know that this all happened.   I was in absolute shock, and I went to the pastors and I said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you do something a year ago? This is bad behavior.&#8221; They denied that the meeting ever took place. They said, &#8220;No, the kid didn&#8217;t report this.&#8221; That&#8217;s when I realized something was wrong. The mother was a friend of mine, I knew her through the school and stuff, and I watched her as she talked to me, and I knew when she was telling me the story, and I was watching her hands shake, that I knew my life was about to change forever. I knew that I was stepping into something that I couldn&#8217;t come back from, but I didn&#8217;t know quite what it was. I called a friend who taught Sunday school with us and I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re a deacon, you do something about it.&#8221; He goes, &#8220;Well, I thought it was all dealt with.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, you claim that you believe all this stuff in the Bible. You can&#8217;t let this go.&#8221; He said that that was a moment that changed his life forever, that I held his feet to the fire.   We got a group of people together and confronted the church. The church did an investigation and claimed that the meeting never took place and that they didn&#8217;t know anything about it, and we knew that it had taken place. We had people who remember when it all occurred and so forth. We left the church, and the Bible study that we founded with our Sunday school class, the day we walked out &#8211; we told the class we had to leave and we were very frank about it &#8211; that class was decimated, and our friends all went to different churches but we still get together twice a month for a Bible study. We&#8217;ve been together for years, and the young man gave me a gift that I will never forget because I believed him. I was at a party and he came up to me and said, &#8220;I got this for you,&#8221; and it was those little Willow Creek&#8211;. Have you seen those little angel carvings? They&#8217;re made of wood. You see them in the Hallmark stores.
EF: Oh, yeah.
DP: And it was the Angel of Courage, and her hands are raised like that, and he said, &#8220;You gave up everything, your church, your Sunday school class, because you believed me.&#8221; And he is a very, very healthy young man today but he was headed down a tough path.   So I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m starting a blog. I&#8217;m going to start writing about a lot of things that have been troubling me for a long time,&#8221; and my husband made me promise&#8211;. He said he wouldn&#8217;t do it again, but my husband and my friend&#8217;s husband were worried that we were going to get in trouble, we were going to get sued, and I can understand why they felt that way. So they asked us, in the incident that happened at that church, not to write about it directly, so we did a series called &#8220;Leaving Wonderland&#8221; and we wrote about what happened but gave names to the characters, like &#8220;Alice&#8221; and so forth.
EF: Sure.
DP: The church was mad at us, they actually got some lawyers, however Jeff Anderson, who is&#8211;. If you look him up on Wiki he&#8217;s the one responsible for most of the settlements against the Catholic Church. He heard about what we did and he called me, he called and talked to me on the phone, and he said, &#8220;I just want to let you know, they can throw you out of the church but they can&#8217;t bring you to court. You&#8217;ve done nothing wrong. If you need me, I&#8217;ll fly in and tell them.&#8221; So he then helped me to understand what I can say and what I can&#8217;t say.
EF: Sure.
DP: So we began writing, we wrote about that. Then Mark Driscoll&#8211;.
EF: And this is the Wartburg Watch, right?
DP: Yes, and we named it after the castle that they had Martin Luther in when the pope was trying to&#8211;.
EF: And what year did you begin this?
DP: 2009.
EF: Okay.
DP: And nobody read us at first, except for people affiliated with the church who wanted to see if they could get any dirt.
EF: Right.
DP: We were very careful about what we said. But we also didn&#8217;t like a lot of other people. Mark Driscoll was very famous, Mars Hill, and if you look at him, he just had to step down, but he was big. We wrote [about him and] we called it &#8220;Brother Mark&#8217;s Traveling Sex Show.&#8221; He came here to UNC campus and we wrote about&#8211;. I mean, he&#8217;s pretty gruesome, and I don&#8217;t&#8211;. It&#8217;s almost hard to talk about some of the things he said as well, about women, as really&#8211;. Well, I mean everyone&#8217;s written about it in the papers, in the New York Times. He called &#8220;penis humps.&#8221;
EF:  Wow.
DP: Yeah. I mean this was stuff that was going on, and we couldn&#8217;t believe it because all of the Neo-Calvinist crowd, they were loving this Mark Driscoll who was into this manly stuff, and my friend and I, we&#8217;re no one. We&#8217;re just like average people. She has an MBA, by the way, from Carolina. We&#8217;re average people and we&#8217;re looking at everything we&#8217;re seeing, and we talked to some pastors at Southeastern, seminarians, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t get it. We all support them and there&#8217;s something wrong with the two of you.&#8221; Well, Mark Driscoll just stepped down, so maybe we weren&#8217;t so stupid after all. We&#8217;re average nobodies.   So I said, &#8220;Look, let&#8217;s get our thoughts out on the table. Let&#8217;s start writing.&#8221; So the first year a few people trickled in. Well, we are still in absolute shock, because then people started sharing their stories. So we started posting their stories at this church and that church, and now, this morning, I had a little technical glitch and a guy in Perth, Australia said, &#8220;I see your glitch. Here&#8217;s how you take care of it.&#8221; I&#8217;ve got a guy in Perth, Australia, and there&#8217;s even a gal who works during the summer months in Antarctica who follows us, and we have people in England and Scotland who are regulars on our blog, and we continue to go after child sex abuse. This was a big deal for us and there are so&#8211;. Boz Tchividjian, who is Billy Graham&#8217;s grandson, he got into this too and he said that the evangelical church is in worse shape than the Catholic Church when it comes to child sex abuse, and he&#8217;s formed a group called GRACE which is exposing child sex abuse in the evangelical church. And he&#8217;s right, because if you look at the statistics you have like a billion adherents in the Catholic Church. If you look at it percentage wise we are higher than the Catholic Church when it comes to not handling child sex abuse, pedophilia, and so forth.
EF: But Catholic abuses are much more in the media.
DP: Yes, although it&#8217;s starting, because we now are&#8211;. We were very involved in exposing the Sovereign Grace Ministries sex abuse cover-up, which we believe is a cover-up, and it is probably the biggest lawsuit that has been brought against one entity within the evangelical population. We were writing about that right from the start as well. A group of families have brought lawsuits against Sovereign Grace Ministries and it&#8217;s going to be a long battle in the courts.   Since that time we have become friends with these folks. We actually have had meetings up in DC where we all get together and go to dinner and talk, and we have formed very intimate relationships with numbers of people who come to our blog, and we also have a number of atheists on our blog who say that we&#8217;re the first Christians that actually fuss at the stuff that they&#8217;ve been fussing at for years. So actually I&#8217;ve had several atheists go to bat for us and what we&#8217;re doing, and that is so wonderful because that&#8217;s what I want; I want them to feel welcome, and I&#8217;m not there trying to&#8211;. And they know I&#8217;m not trying to convert them.
EF: You&#8217;re just trying to expose what you see as a big abuse happening.
DP: So that gives you a rough idea. So we then got into domestic violence, in fact we were rather feisty out of the gate. Paige Patterson, who used to be the Southeastern Seminary president and who then went back to Southwestern Baptist Seminary, they were dedicating a building to him, and he had just come out with a tape &#8211; he was at a conference and we listened to the audio &#8211; in which he told a woman to go back to her abusive husband, [and she] came back to church. You can read it, because we always link. We never say things we don&#8217;t have links to. Jeff Anderson pounded that into us. She came back to church with two black eyes the next week and she said to him, &#8220;Do you see?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;You should be glad your husband started going to church.&#8221; So we called for Southeastern Seminary to not dedicate the building to him and for Paige Patterson to step down, and of course they were laughing. Nobody was reading our blog.  We probably had about fifty hits at that point.   So, we have also gotten involved with the problems within the evangelical church and how they view domestic violence. It bothers us terribly.
EF: Sure. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more?
DP: Yeah. One of the leaders of the Neo-Cal movement is&#8211;.
EF: Can you explain what that means? What is Neo-Calvinism?
DP: The term came out of the late 1990s into the early 2000s. It was like people rediscovering John Calvin, and suddenly his doctrines, his views and so forth, were looked at as more pure, so they began changing seminaries. Southern Seminary, which is the flagship seminary of the SBC&#8211;.
EF: That&#8217;s in Louisville?
DP: Yeah. Al Mohler &#8211;  who knows us really well &#8211; Al Mohler went in and basically decimated it and pretty much filled it all with Calvinists, and this is going on in New Orleans Seminary, Southeastern Seminary. They are advising people to get into the Baptist churches as Reformed Baptists but not to tell people they&#8217;re Calvinists and, once they&#8217;re in, to change things, and if you want to read a fascinating story about how that worked, it happened right here at First Baptist Church, Durham, and we wrote about it, how Andy Davis came in and did not tell them what he was going to do. That is one of our blog posts that we wrote a few years ago, that still gets a ton of hits, and we were able to analyze it because Andy Davis has been very open, put everything he did out online, so it was very easy. We direct quoted him.   So, they have a view that anybody who doesn&#8217;t toe the line, as one of their guys, R.C. Sproul said, &#8220;They may be Christians but they&#8217;re just barely Christians.&#8221; That&#8217;s the rest of us, we&#8217;re barely Christians, and they are adamant. They believe that God chose people at the beginning of time to be saved, and only those people are saved, and everybody else is going to go to hell and they have no chance whatsoever, and I&#8211;. I&#8217;m not there, and I tried. I read all their stuff. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to learn this stuff,&#8221; I actually did a notebook for myself, and I never could get there. I backed away from it.   So the Neo-Calvinist movement, until recently, has been growing by leaps and bounds, has stood fairly unchallenged, but now there are some really great people who are scholars and who are rigorous theologically who are taking on the Neo-Calvinists, and they&#8217;re giving them a run for their money. Their most famous &#8211; Al Mohler, from Southern Seminary, and John Piper. Now, John Piper had a lot to do with the views of the Neo-Calvinists with domestic violence; however Paige Patterson is not a Calvinist, he&#8217;s an Arminian, and he&#8217;s had a core view. But John Piper says that a woman should endure abuse for a season &#8211; we have a video, you can see this &#8211; and then she should go to the church, and the church should tell the guy basically not to do it. But he&#8217;s very laid back about this whole thing and he said, &#8220;Now, if her life is in eminent danger she can separate from him but she can never remarry. She&#8217;s tied to him forever.&#8221;   His thinking, unfortunately, permeates, and so there is a Reformed pastor in Oregon who started a movement called Cry for Justice in which, he is Reformed, and he&#8217;s taking the Reformed leaders to task for their belief in domestic violence, and we have featured some of their writing on our blog as well. But even my previous church, a group of women went and asked if they could put a phone number for the domestic violence hotline up, and the church refused to allow them to do that, because they needed to come to them to deal with the domestic violence&#8211;
EF: Wow.
DP: &#8211;and not involve &#8211; yeah &#8211; and not involve the outside. Because, &#8220;They&#8217;re not Christians and counselors outside of the church are secular and they obviously are not going to understand how to deal with this as a Christian,&#8221; which is baloney because there are a lot of people, who are actually evangelical, who are counselors outside the church who handle things tremendously, who don&#8217;t buy this. So, we would get letters from women who had been advised to return to their husbands and we are very much against that.
EF: Sure.
DP: Now there&#8217;s one other area of abuse, and this one&#8217;s going to be hard for me to explain, and we call it spiritual abuse. One of our well-known articles is by Todd Wilhelm. How are we doing on time?
EF: Fine. I&#8217;m making sure that it&#8217;s still recording. You&#8217;re fine.
DP: Okay. I wanted to make sure I&#8217;m not talking too much.
EF: No. Please continue.
DP: There&#8217;s a man who originally got involved in a 9Marks church. 9Marks is a Reformed Baptist movement; its head is Mark Dever, who&#8217;s friends with Al Mohler, and has a church called Capitol Hill Baptist Church in DC. They have planted a number of churches around the world and one was planted in Dubai. There is a man who is working for a company over in Dubai, he&#8217;s an American, and he was attending the 9Marks church in Dubai. He was leading a Bible study, he was actually being &#8211; they wanted to put him more into church leadership. They have a bookstore, and in the bookstore they are selling books by C. J. Mahaney, who&#8217;s the head of Sovereign Grace Ministries, the one in which there&#8217;s this horrible lawsuit on numbers of children who were abused within that ministry. By the way, some of those perps are in jail, but the lawsuits are saying that the church purposefully covered it up. This is their allegation. It hasn&#8217;t been to trial, but they covered it up &#8211; I believe them &#8211; covered it up so that it wouldn&#8217;t get out.   This lawsuit is very well-known, it&#8217;s been written about by the New York Times, everybody&#8217;s written about the lawsuit. This guy was the head of the whole thing and he was very entrenched in the Neo-Calvinist movement, C. J. Mahaney and Sovereign Grace. So Todd went into the bookstore and said, &#8220;They&#8217;re pushing C. J. Mahaney&#8217;s books. I&#8217;ve met a couple of those kids who were abused. I know some of those families. We should not have this man&#8217;s books in our bookstore,&#8221; and he told them, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to become a member of the leadership until you get rid of these books. I can&#8217;t in good conscience support this. To me child sex abuse is a horrendous blot on the church,&#8221; and they said no, and in fact they push&#8211;. They quote C. J. Mahaney a lot in the services.   So he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s it, I&#8217;m out of here. I&#8217;m not going to be a member of this church,&#8221; except he signed a membership covenant, and this is something that we talk about at length. These membership covenants are actually legal. They can be legally enforced. You can read&#8211;. We&#8217;ve written extensively on it. So they told him that he couldn&#8217;t leave the church, that according to their membership covenant he has to join another church that they approve of. So they kept his name as a member of the church and because he wasn&#8217;t coming to church he was then eligible for church discipline where they get up in front of the church and say, &#8220;We need to shun him,&#8211;
EF: Wow.
DP: &#8211;&#8220;he&#8217;s not a Christian,&#8221; and they believe that they hold the keys to say whether or not a person is a Christian, isn&#8217;t a Christian and, by the way,&#8211;
EF: Oh my goodness.
DP: &#8211;this is in the Neo-Calvinist movement, so all of these guys, like Al Mohler, all of these people are buying into this, and we&#8217;ve written about this whole new thing, about keys of authority, the keys to decide who is a communing member, and who&#8211;.
EF: And you call this spiritual abuse.
DP: We call it spiritual abuse, because they leave&#8211;. This man is standing up for his conscience. In I Corinthians 5, Paul talks about church discipline but he talks about a guy. It was for a major problem. A guy was sleeping with his mother-in-law and the church was saying that&#8217;s okay, because we&#8217;re all free in Christ, and Paul said, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t live like this. This is against our standards within the church,&#8221; again, within the church, &#8220;He either needs to get his act together or get thrown out.&#8221; So this is the example of church discipline in the New Testament. They&#8217;re disciplining him because he decided to stand up for his conscience. He wasn&#8217;t sleeping with his mother-in-law and saying that Jesus is cool with this.
EF: Right.
DP: He was saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this, I can&#8217;t be part of it. And instead of staying in the church and being part of it, I&#8217;m going to leave. And no, I&#8217;m not joining a church right away. I&#8217;m going to take some time before I jump out of the frying pan into the fire. I&#8217;m going to be careful.&#8221;
EF: But he couldn&#8217;t even leave, you&#8217;re saying.
DP: He couldn&#8217;t leave, and so this went on for eight months. We have nicknamed it, and it&#8217;s starting to stick, that 9Marks is the Hotel California of the evangelical set, you can check in but you can&#8217;t leave. This story now is slowly gaining some&#8211;. The Associated Baptist Press recently talked about Mark Dever and these keys of authority but then they quoted us and Todd Wilhelm&#8217;s story, and Todd has become such a good friend. He flew in from Dubai to see his family and a bunch of us all got together in DC this summer and got a chance to meet Todd.   So we talk with each other all the time via emails, and we even call each other, and there is a sense of camaraderie amongst&#8211;. We&#8217;re not the only bloggers looking at abusive issues within the church, there are some others as well, and we support all of those who are doing that. One of the best ones, Dr. Warren Throckmorton, is a professor at Grove City College and he contacted me about nine months ago about Mark Driscoll and some of the stuff we had posted, and he said, &#8220;Has he ever apologized for any of this stuff?&#8221; We said, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not his style.&#8221; So Warren Throckmorton has now become famous. He actually has focused on Mark Driscoll and it was his expos&#233;s that caused Mark Driscoll to step down two weeks ago, and Warren and I are in constant communication on some of the various issues. So there is a sense of camaraderie; we are all Christians. Most of them are like me, not fundamentalist, but.
EF: Yeah, sure. Well thanks for the details on that. That&#8217;s really fascinating. I have a few questions left. I know you have a quote that you brought.
DP: At some time. I don&#8217;t want to forget that quote.
EF: Okay. I&#8217;ll be sure.
DP: Because it defines me.
EF: Good. Maybe that&#8217;s something that we can close on, if that would work.
DP: Cool.
EF: Well I wanted to ask about&#8211;. I mean do you consider yourself moderate then, politically, or&#8211;  DP: Yeah.  EF: &#8211;theologically? Is that where you frame yourself?  DP: Yeah. My kids and I, we&#8217;re all talking &#8211; they&#8217;re all in their twenties now &#8211; and my husband and stuff, and&#8211;. See, in Boston I was considered conservative.  EF: Yeah.   DP: But in other places they consider me liberal, and I think I&#8217;m moderate. And I&#8217;m willing to look at issues that a lot of people, like even the gay issue. There either seems to be two sides: yea or nay. Now, once again, I say within the church you get to decide what you want to decide, but I decided I needed to become sensitized to the issue. I got a chance &#8211; I was so excited &#8211; to sit for a few hours with in Lee of the Gay Christian Network, and he&#8217;s considered a fairly well-known gay activist, and I was able to&#8211;. What I wanted to do is sensitize people to things, like for example reparative therapy. Reparative therapy doesn&#8217;t work.   By the way, Warren Throckmorton became well known. He is a chair of psychology and he used to speak for NARTH and was into reparative therapy and in [I think] 2005 he started really looking at the studies and realized he had made a horrendous mistake, and he came out and said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m wrong. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; And he was beaten to death by the conservative Christian crowd. But to me it&#8217;s important that we see beyond our prejudice and to look into and understand the lives of people, where they&#8217;re coming from.   I love Justin Lee, and because I love Justin Lee there are some people who are not happy with me, that I love Justin Lee, and he&#8217;s helped me to define myself in terms of how I can develop a theology that gives adherence to the Bible but also looks at things on a more broad basis. So he&#8217;s wonderful, and in fact he contacts me occasionally to be in a focus group or something like that, so I&#8217;m one of the few more conservative people who&#8217;s willing to look at a subject like that.  EF: Right. Okay. That certainly makes total sense and, I wonder, maybe another issue&#8211;. Maybe it&#8217;s been alluded to but I wonder if you could tell me, what are your views on feminism?   DP: I believe women can be pastors. I disagree&#8211;  EF: Yeah. That&#8217;s what I meant when&#8211;.  DP: &#8211;with&#8211;. Yeah, I do believe, and Pete Briscoe helped me to see that through, and I got a chance to meet his mother, Jill. I believe that women can do whatever&#8211;. I believe God&#8217;s given us all gifts. I didn&#8217;t know that I could write, by the way, until&#8211;. I used to think I could speak better than I could write. We all have been given gifts and we need to use them, and there should be nothing that prevents a woman from doing whatever a man can do except, for example, there&#8217;s a strength issue,  but then again for some men there&#8217;s a strength issue on things as well.  EF: Right.   DP: I realize that most people within evangelical Christianity do not support women as pastors. I don&#8217;t make it a hill to die on, but I have made my viewpoint known. My guess is, in years to come, that issue will change, and, see, even like Park Street Church up in Boston. I was reading an article &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry, Grace Church, which is kind of like Park Street Church, up in Boston &#8211; and I saw they now have an associate woman pastor. So, it&#8217;s kind of funny; I think it&#8217;s North versus South.   EF: Yeah,  for sure.   DP: Yeah.  EF: Well those are really all the questions that I had. I thought that if there&#8217;s anything else you wanted to address this is certainly the time to do it, and I see you brought an important quote along with you.  DP: Yes. I&#8217;ll make sure&#8211;. Oh, just one other thing.  EF: Sure.  DP: I believe in dialogue, and that we don&#8217;t hear each other and we put each other in boxes. And that&#8217;s why when we started the blog I told my friend that no matter how harsh somebody is, say we have somebody come to our blog who&#8217;s an atheist and they&#8217;re harsh with us, don&#8217;t&#8211;. People use harsh words to push people away and instead to see what is underneath the surface. There&#8217;s a man who came to our blog, he works for the Department of Defense, and he had walked away from evangelical Christianity. Oh, was he hard, really difficult language. Some people got mad that I allowed him to continue, but I saw something below his words. I felt he was trying too hard to push us away, and why was he coming to the blog and trying so hard? Over time other people started being kind to him as well, and he got sick and landed in the ICU with a cellulitis and a bunch of people in the DC area &#8211; and I drove up &#8211; visited him. Last November my husband and I went up and he was baptized. He struggled with his weight for years, and we&#8217;re talking four hundred pounds, and [my husband and I] convinced him to have a gastric sleeve. He&#8217;s lost a hundred pounds and his life&#8211;. He has softened and he wrote a hundred and forty letters, and we&#8217;re putting it together in a book, asking people to forgive him for the way that he was and how poorly he treated them. When somebody says that the internet cannot be used to develop friendships, they&#8217;re wrong. It depends on who&#8217;s running the blog and how much they want it.   There&#8217;s a quote that I read shortly after my Star Trek experience, it&#8217;s about two paragraphs, but it is who I am and how I view people who come into my life:   &#8220;It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest, most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations &#8211; these are mortal and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously &#8211; no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.&#8221;  What I have challenged people to do on my blog, and in some talks that I get, is to never view anybody you meet in your life as an ordinary person. I&#8217;ve challenged people to find out who the ladies are in the cafeteria when those trays go through the opening. There is an immortal in back of that opening. You&#8217;re to know them. There&#8217;s an immortal who is taking your shopping cart back into Walmart. Remember that. Remember when you check out you are dealing with an immortal and you treat them with the love and respect that the creator of those immortals gives them, and you&#8217;re to love them to the best of your ability. That, through it all, is who I am and how I view anybody who comes into my life and onto my blog. They&#8217;re not a bunch of words, they are an immortal person worthy of love and respect, and I force myself to remember that, even when the comments are difficult.  EF: Well thanks for sharing. Who is the&#8211;?  DP: C. S. Lewis, and The Weight of Glory.  EF: Okay, great. Well, with that I guess we can call it a day.  Thank you so much for sharing.  DP:  I bet I talked too much.   EF: No, not at all. I&#8217;m going to turn this off.
