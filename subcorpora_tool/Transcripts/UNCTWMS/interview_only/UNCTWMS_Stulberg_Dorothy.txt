Joey Fink: This is Joey Fink. It&#8217;s May 12, 2011. I&#8217;m interviewing Dorothy Stulberg for the Southern Oral History Program in her home in Knoxville, Tennessee. Ms. Stulberg, thank you so much.
Dorothy Stulberg: Oh, I&#8217;m excited.
JF: We can pause anytime to take a break, let me know, but can you start by telling me when you were born and where you grew up?
DS: Okay. I was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa, July 4, 1925, grew up and was educated there. That answer it?
JF: Mm hmm. What was your family like, a big family, small family?
DS: Ordinary. I had a brother and a sister and a mother and dad and one of my favorite words is &#8220;facticity.&#8221; It&#8217;s that the good things that happen that you have nothing to do with. I didn&#8217;t choose my wonderful parents and my wonderful brother and sister, and I think that accepting that fact, that so much comes your way that&#8212;. I was born in a state that loved education and it was a great growing up.
JF: Was there an expectation that you would go to college?
DS: No. My dad didn&#8217;t graduate from high school. I think my mother may have taken a few credits. She never got a degree but I think she took a few credits before she got married. No. I guess one could say there was an expectation but nobody ever said it, and we were poor. This was poverty time, this was Depression time, so the idea that you might be able to go I don&#8217;t think was ever doubted but never said. All three of us graduated with a BS. I was the only one who went on. My brother died last year and he was wonderful. My sister&#8217;s still alive and she&#8217;s wonderful. I mean [I&#8217;m] lucky, lucky, lucky.
JF: What did you think you would do when you were a teenager? Did you have&#8212;
DS: I had no idea.
JF: &#8212;any ideas?
DS: No, no. What ended up, with another wonderful break&#8212;. This was during the Second World War and Curtiss-Wright had what they called Curtiss-Wright Cadets. I went to Purdue, took a fast crash course on aeronautical engineering, and worked on airplanes.
JF: Wow.
DS: Yeah. I worked as assistant to an engineer and so there was my boost and some money and the first time out of state for any period, all alone, knew nobody, but that was the beginning of my choice. It&#8217;s what I wanted to be. I took three years and my advisor said: No place for women; get out of this. [That&#8217;s how it was at] that time of life.
JF: [Laughs] Was this at Purdue?
DS: Oh, after the war. Then I went to Iowa State and altogether I had three years of aeronautical engineering and then my advisor said get out. [Laughs] If you would believe it, I took a year of home ec. I couldn&#8217;t boil water. So my degree is a bachelor of science but it&#8217;s in home ec.
JF: What did you think when he said that?
DS: I didn&#8217;t think anything. You were a woman, you were basically under the control of men, and back then&#8212;. I can imagine what I&#8217;d do now; I&#8217;d throw the book at him.
JF: [Laughs]
DS: But that&#8217;s what we did, and life has been for me&#8212;. It turned out to be great. So, where are we? Anyway, then I graduated from Iowa State.
JF: Okay. And was there an expectation that you would get married, have children, stay at home?
DS: It wasn&#8217;t for me. My sister and brother both got married. I didn&#8217;t get married until I was thirty, and that was old. That was old. [Laughs] My obstetrician told me that if I didn&#8217;t get pregnant in the first six months he was going to do something about it, and that was because when you were that age back then you didn&#8217;t have babies. So, anyway, two of my daughters that are married waited until they were thirty.
JF: So what did you do? You had your BS in home economics; you were twenty-two, maybe?
DS: I went to work for General Electric in designing household equipment. I was there two years, almost two years, and then the University of Minnesota asked me if I would come teach. I didn&#8217;t have a master&#8217;s, which is most amazing, but there wasn&#8217;t anybody with my combination of skills, so when I was the same age as the kids [Laughs] I taught seven years at the university, wonderful, wonderful years.
JF: And you were in your twenties then?
DS: Uh huh. I would have been twenty-one when I started teaching, never any idea&#8212;. I mean life just unfolds. It was a wonderful seven years, and that&#8217;s where I met my husband, who was working on his doctorate in biochemistry. Then he came down here, and what did women do? They left their career. [Laughs] Which hurt, but&#8230;
JF: So he got hired at UT-Knoxville?
DS: No, I didn&#8217;t get hired. I raised our kids.
JF: But he was at UT-Knoxville?
DS: I&#8217;m sorry?
JF: Where did he work?
DS: At the laboratory.
JF: In Oak Ridge.
DS: In Oak Ridge, yeah. He was a basic researcher there. That&#8217;s why we came.
JF: Okay.
DS: It was very, very hard for me because I wasn&#8217;t working [outside the home] but I did all kinds of research. The League of Women Voters was wonderful, wonderful. I think they saved my life, basically.
JF: How so?
DS: Gave me something where you used your mind. Oh, in our neighborhood everybody had coffee every morning, coffee every morning and talked about nothing. I mean I just dried up. Mel worked many hours, my husband. I had three little kids, which I loved, I mean I don&#8217;t regret the years, but I did loads of volunteer work, loads of volunteer work, and became aware of the tragic lives that people were living. In 1964 the Poverty Act was passed and I and another friend who was a League member decided that if it wasn&#8217;t going to be political ordinary people had to get out there and help communities organize, so for a number of years I worked with Community Action. I was director for awhile and I was chairperson for a long time and those were good years. They were years when people didn&#8217;t even have outhouses and one of our programs was building outhouses in rural areas, meeting wonderful people, and they&#8217;re still my friends, just wonderful people. Then I griped and I griped and I griped and I griped because I saw people who had become my friends end up in court and no possibility they wouldn&#8217;t be found guilty. It just&#8212;.
JF: What were they in court for?
DS: Oh, stealing, a couple murders. I represented a couple murderers. Actually [Laughs] I found some of these people who did bad things I liked better than the people who were prosecuting them. When you looked at their life and how they maintained anything; if you don&#8217;t have education and you don&#8217;t have health and there&#8217;s nobody that pats your head and says, &#8220;You can do it.&#8221; So I griped, and one of my friends [Laughs] kept saying, go to law school. I&#8217;m a non-doer and let life fall where it falls, and one of my friends brought me the application to take the LSAT to be a lawyer. I was forty-seven&#8212;
JF: Wow.
DS: &#8212;at that time and I&#8217;d never wanted to be a lawyer. Could you&#8212;? [Pause] Thank you.
JF: No problem.
DS: But it was a solution to the things I was griping about. So I graduated when I was forty-nine and one other woman in my class, in my actual class. A third person graduated when I did and she became my partner and we were the first women&#8217;s law firm. Nobody would hire us, nobody.
JF: So you created your own law firm.
DS: We couldn&#8217;t even clerk. Nobody would let us clerk. We couldn&#8217;t get a loan unless our husbands signed and we were darned&#8212;. I mean that was not going to happen. So we finally found&#8212;and I wish I could remember which bank; I don&#8217;t remember. We borrowed five thousand dollars. At the end of the year it was paid off. We never made very much money but we always made our overhead and we were partners until&#8212;.   Let&#8217;s see. I retired supposedly in July last year. I think January was my last case. I&#8217;ll be eighty-six and your mind doesn&#8217;t click fast enough, so I got another job and worked at the university pro bono in the Teaching and Learning Center to help professors understand the generation that they&#8217;re trying to teach now. I hated giving up being a lawyer but since January of this year, I hit the low and I haven&#8217;t been able to go back to work since then. I&#8217;m hoping but I just know it&#8217;s useless because what I have is a stupid disease that nobody has. There&#8217;s not another person that has it, there&#8217;s no cure, no treatment, but you don&#8217;t hurt; you just get tired. [Laughs] That&#8217;s all, so.
JF: Who was your partner?
DS: Ann Mostoller.
JF: Okay. I&#8217;m meeting her next week.
DS: Good, good. She&#8217;s very different than I am. It&#8217;s probably how we could stay together as partners because with lawyers, you know, they split up, they divide, they do all kinds of things but we&#8217;ve been partners since&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see, we started in &#8217;74. Is that right? We started in &#8217;74 and she&#8217;s still practicing. She&#8217;s a lot younger than I am. Everybody&#8217;s younger than I am. But we&#8217;re very different. I would say if you want to say did we really get along, we didn&#8217;t, but it was a perfect combination. She&#8217;s a looking forward person, very honest. I mean we really had a good reputation, still do, and she&#8217;s a bookkeeper. I mean not literally but she&#8217;s&#8212;. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say that, but I don&#8217;t think she liked my clients. Her clients were the wealthier group. Now she&#8217;s a trustee in bankruptcy, which is perfect for her. Honest, and has done some very good things for girls. Now she has grandchildren and she&#8217;s much softer. [Laughs] We would not have had our law firm if it hadn&#8217;t been for her because she could do the organizing, seeing that we didn&#8217;t represent both sides, we didn&#8217;t have conflicts. She looked ahead and knew where we had to go if we were to survive, so those were wonderful years, wonderful, wonderful years.
JF: It sounds like the War on Poverty legislation really changed your life.
DS: Oh, Margaret Meade came down here and really took Oak Ridge to heart&#8212;no, not to heart, I mean a lecture: How could Oak Ridge sit here in the middle of all this poverty? And Oak Ridge was isolated. We had actually government subsidy, for transportation, for education, but segregation. I&#8217;ll never forget when we came down here. The African Americans would walk off the sidewalk and rarely looked you in the eyes, couldn&#8217;t wash their clothes in the laundry mat, couldn&#8217;t roller skate in the roller skating rink, and schools became desegregated about that time. It was done very poorly. But anyway, yes&#8212;.
JF: The desegregation was done poorly?
DS: Done poorly, done poorly.
JF: Your children, the school they went to did not desegregate?
DS: They divided up the community so that your next door neighbor didn&#8217;t go to the same elementary school you went to, and that&#8217;s where you form some kind of community, and not very many blacks in each school so there wasn&#8217;t a central&#8212;. I mean it was all done with good faith, I think people really wanted it to work, but they took people out of their comfortable black schools, black teachers, who knew their families. So maybe they weren&#8217;t as highly educated as the Oak Ridge teachers, as the regular school, but they were wonderful teachers, wonderful women.   So you&#8217;re exactly right, it was the Poverty Act, and my friend and I went around to the various rural communities organizing because we thought keep politics out, have just ordinary people go, and oh, we made just wonderful friends in the rural areas that are still my friends since &#8217;64. We learned, at least I learned, that you have to listen. I talked to one woman who wanted to get running water, they had no running water, and she said I don&#8217;t want it because I can get water out of the well. If I don&#8217;t have any money I still get water. If I&#8217;m on the water line I have to pay a bill. The experience that she came from&#8212;. One community, what they wanted to do more than anything was paint their mailboxes. Now would you&#8212;? But they had other things that made sense to me. They had an awful garbage dump that everybody in the county dumped in. There were rats and whatever and they could never get anybody to listen to them. So we went with them to the county commission and in a few days that was gone. And they changed the name of their community and they improved their schools, but I don&#8217;t know that that has gone on. Community Action is very strong in our county. We have a county Community Action and no politics.  JF: And that&#8217;s Anderson County?  DS: Uh huh.  JF: Was it mostly men or mostly women in the communities that you worked with?  DS: [Pause] Oh, it was&#8212;. I&#8217;m not sure I could say. One community built a park and that park was initiated by men. I would say getting rid of the dump was men. That&#8217;s a hard question. I suspect women probably were the major. One group got commercial canning equipment and started a community canning center; now that was women. I&#8217;m trying to think of&#8212;the people I&#8217;ve kept contact with are mostly women. [To dog] Freddie! Go, go.  JF: He&#8217;s okay. He must know we&#8217;re recording. He&#8217;s being very quiet.  DS: He won&#8217;t leave you alone.  JF: [Laughs] So a friend gave you an application for the LSATs.  DS: Oh, yeah. They knew that I was sort of: I don&#8217;t want to be a lawyer. She brought me the papers, had me fill them out in front of her, took them to the mailbox and put them in the mail. [Laughs]  JF: What did your family think, your children and your husband?   DS: My husband was very supportive. My two daughters and I were all in school at the same time. [Laughs] So, yeah, everybody was supportive. A lot of funny things happened because there just weren&#8217;t women lawyer and all kinds of funny things happened. When I went for a deposition I was always supposedly the court reporter. I mean when you went to a doctor&#8217;s office they never expected you to&#8212;. One really funny&#8212;. I did a lot of criminal law in the beginning and I was sitting with my client in front of the judge and the judge said to my client, &#8220;Do you have a lawyer?&#8221; and I stood up and said, &#8220;Your honor, I&#8217;m his lawyer.&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;Oh, I thought you were his mother.&#8221; Now that was in the early &#8217;90s. Isn&#8217;t that wild? Funny, funny, but you know they were funny. It wasn&#8217;t because&#8212;. That just wasn&#8217;t being mean. He just&#8212;his eyes were closed. Anyway, that one was one of the funniest things. [Laughs]  JF: How were you treated at the University of Tennessee as a law student?   DS: One professor stopped me on the steps and said, &#8220;Women should never be lawyers because they&#8217;ll cry.&#8221; [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  DS: And he was serious. I mean that was no joke to him. I had a class with him. Anyway, there were funny things. My first professor&#8212;. Back then people didn&#8217;t have to take a schedule, like both of us had young children so we had to pace the hours that we actually went to school. One of my first professors at the end of the class gave me a copy of the Constitution and said, &#8220;You are the kind of person that should be in law school.&#8221; Now if you don&#8217;t think that gave me courage. I mean it was a recognition that it was all right, so some people were ready for it. I don&#8217;t remember being humiliated. Well the guy who said women shouldn&#8217;t be lawyers; okay. It didn&#8217;t get me, and actually I did cry. I did cry because I saw a jury was going to find&#8212;. I knew they were going to find a person guilty and I knew he wasn&#8217;t guilty and in my closing it just got to me, so I proved him right. [Laughs] Anyway, I loved my clients, I loved my clients. When you knew the background and the struggles and how much they needed love and recognition or something. Anyway, they were wonderful years.  JF: Did you consider yourself part of the women&#8217;s movement in the &#8217;70s?  DS: Oh yeah. One of the things we did, in the newspaper we were always &#8220;Mrs. Mel Stulberg,&#8221; we were never &#8220;Dorothy Stulberg,&#8221; and I used to get awards and they were &#8220;Mrs. Mel Stulberg.&#8221; Well we got on the newspaper and it took forever but they finally agreed to use our names.  JF: When was this?  DS: Oh, golly. I don&#8217;t know the time but it was probably in the &#8217;90s.  JF: Wow. [Laughs]  DS: I&#8217;m trying with all this stuff to do a kind of&#8212;what would you call it?&#8212;the dates that things happened, a timeline, because &#8217;74 is a long time ago and &#8217;64 is a long time ago and that&#8217;s when the act passed. I would say probably human rights has probably been up here but it was the women who needed the most, who were the least recognized, but I would say, I mean I&#8217;ve done a lot with African Americans. I did a lot. A long time client, a wonderful woman, just called today from Chattanooga. I became her attorney twenty years ago when she was discriminated against.   I did a lot of discrimination work and in the beginning a lot of criminal work because that was something men didn&#8217;t like to do because you didn&#8217;t get much pay because they were poor people, so we really got kind of a start. One attorney was wonderful to me in helping me. See we didn&#8217;t have any mentors. We had to do everything really by trial and error and I always took cases&#8212;. Oh, I can show you something funny. Where is it? Oh, here it is. This is hilarious, and I&#8217;m really kind of proud of it. I don&#8217;t know who did it but an attorney did it. [Laughs] These are three cases and two of them are about girls and one was about law students, but this attorney did this and sent it to me and I think it&#8217;s hilarious, and it&#8217;s true. These are three old, stodgy Tennessee Court of Appeals [judges].  JF: Can I take a picture of this later?  DS: Oh sure, sure.  JF: So I&#8217;ll have a picture of this to include with your interview, but it&#8217;s a hand drawn comic and it says, &#8220;The short but happy legal career of Dorothy Stulberg,&#8221; and there&#8217;s three, as Ms. Stulberg said, stodgy old judges. One is saying, &#8220;All I did was tell her that girls are inferior to boys, and of course there&#8217;s nothing new in that,&#8221; and another one is saying, &#8220;All I did was tell her that law students are too immature to attend faculty meetings, an obvious fact,&#8221; and the third one says, &#8220;All I did was deny a car to a girl who hasn&#8217;t earned enough Brownie points, but I did give her a hundred and twenty-five dollars for a good try.&#8221; And then a sort of wretched looking creature, huddled before them, has a thought bubble that says, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll try for medical school, but then all my patients will probably die.&#8221;   DS: [Laughs] Those were three of my cases. And that just looks like those three guys. I don&#8217;t think that looks like me, but. [Laughs]  JF: No, no, not at all. So these represent three cases you took on?  DS: Hmm?  JF: These represent three cases you took on?  DS: Yeah.   JF: Can you tell me about them?  DS: Yeah. [Pause]   JF: Hang on just a second. Let me pause and skip to the next track.  DS: Let&#8217;s see, I&#8217;m not sure. I know the law student one was my first case and the law school had denied tenure to what we all thought was a wonderful woman and so on behalf of the law students we sued the university. My first case, [Laughs] sued the law school for not allowing the students to attend their meetings where they considered this woman, who was really, really wonderful. This one, it was for a wife in a divorce, a wife and three daughters, and one daughter had decided to go with her mother and it was the wisest thing she ever did. She was very young and decided not to go with the father. The court of appeals back then were not as good about women divorcees and the child got nothing. All they said she could have is a hundred and twenty-five dollars from her father.  JF: A month or just a hundred and twenty-five dollars?  DS: Just a hundred and twenty-five dollars, to get a car. What was this one? That&#8217;s funny; I don&#8217;t remember that one. It&#8217;ll come to me but I don&#8217;t at this moment remember it. But I got that in the mail, no name, [Laughs] but I knew it was an attorney. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  DS: Anyway, that&#8217;s kind of my prize. That kind of shows what my career was, not appealing to the court system.  JF: Let me pause for just a second to skip to the next track. [Break in recording] How did you learn about the women&#8217;s movement?  DS: [Pause] Well, I&#8217;ll tell you. I think women owe a tremendous amount to African Americans because I think their recognition of self allowed women to think a little about their status, so in my own heart I feel I owe a tremendous&#8212;. I think all white women owe the black movement because I think most of us&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know, it may not be right, but I know I had not really&#8212;. When my husband moved down here of course I moved down here. When I got married of course I take his name. I could feel a few rumbles inside about some of them, like if you have a profession you lose your name, so I can remember a few rumbles. But no matter whether you worked or not you did the cooking, you did the cleaning, you took the kids where they needed to go. But to see the African Americans take hold of their&#8212;trying to find their own identity or telling us, we have our own identity, I really think that made us aware that we too had a problem with our identity. We were a wife, we were a woman; we were in a way not a separate individual. It was my experience that very few women thought about what their position was. This was their position. I love the psychologists&#8217; take on positioning because I think women were positioned and we accepted it, in general accepted it.   At least for me the beginning of life, of recognition of the world, came about in &#8217;64. I saw so much. Actually a lot of my volunteer work was with the isolated community in Oak Ridge. The blacks were totally separated, totally separated, initially didn&#8217;t go to school with white kids, and to see that. I&#8217;ll just never forget walking down the street. They couldn&#8217;t eat&#8212;. We with our little, only had one kid at that time, in a stroller, we ate along with black people in the&#8212;. It was a store that had an eating counter and we went and ate with African Americans, broke it. But I&#8217;ll never forget.  JF: You took your child with you to protest segregated dining?  DS: Yeah, yeah. It was so wrong. They could wait on you, they could handle your food, but they couldn&#8217;t eat with you. But the most telling thing to me was walking down the street and that feeling that the road belonged to me; it didn&#8217;t belong to them. Where I grew up it was a different situation. There were blacks, one was head of the student body, we swam in the same pool, but it was not the same issue as down here because there were not very many African Americans in Iowa, but we certainly grew up without prejudice. I mean it was just&#8212;. Imagine: I would have been in junior high when we had a swimming pool at school and we all swam together, so you would never expect them to avoid your eyes, so I think that shock. Where did we start with this? [Laughs] I ramble.  JF: No, no, this is great. The League of Women Voters&#8212;?  DS: Yeah. The Poverty Act and the League of Women Voters made me aware, and in fact I became head of the local committee to organize communities, and so I would say it was in &#8217;64 that passed.  JF: Were there other women in the League of Women Voters who also shared your views about segregation?  DS: Oh yeah. It was national. It was a national movement in the League, yeah. It was a project.  JF: So you formed some friendships and allies there.  DS: Yeah, and there were so many intelligent women in Oak Ridge with no jobs and so the amount of volunteer work was huge. Women were so involved in the local community. Now they didn&#8217;t start I really think until Margaret Meade came and gave that talk, and the League&#8217;s movement, were what began awareness. But I don&#8217;t think people even now are truly aware of the poverty. They&#8217;re comfortable.  JF: [Pause] Did you ever go to a consciousness raising?  DS: To what?  JF: A consciousness raising group?  DS: No.  JF: Did you have any reading groups or book clubs with women, reading feminist literature in the &#8217;70s?  DS: No.  JF: What kind of groups&#8212;? Were you involved with the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center?  DS: No. Other than the League and Community Action I don&#8217;t think I belonged to&#8212;and NOW. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever belonged to&#8212;. I&#8217;m not an organization person.   JF: Do you remember when you joined NOW?  DS: No. Forever.  JF: Yeah.  DS: Yeah, forever. I don&#8217;t belong now. I think lawyering just took over my life. Things sort of&#8212;. I&#8217;m remembering things now as I&#8217;m looking at this. Just was very involved in community stuff but not organizations.   JF: Can you tell me some more about the Community Action?  DS: Oh yeah. The experiences I had or&#8212;? Well the beauty of Anderson County was it was not political. Every county around us was political. We went without paid help. I was director for a long time and we weren&#8217;t paid. Now there is an actual structure but in the beginning nobody knew exactly where this was going to go and we were determined it was going to go nonpolitical and that the whole purpose of it was that people speak and that you help people organize themselves, so the idea is beautiful. We did, as I say, build outhouses; had a Green Thumb program, distributing seeds so people could grow their own food. We&#8212;. [Laughs] Oh, God. Susie and I, Nan Shugart&#8217;s mother, Susie and I started Home Decorating on a Shoestring, and, oh, golly, that was fun. We thought people should have beauty around them. [Laughs] We were kind of crazy, I guess. We&#8217;d go into people&#8217;s homes with them and together we&#8217;d paint, we&#8217;d get pictures, we&#8217;d get artificial flowers, and that was just plain old friends.  JF: That&#8217;s great.  DS: And if somebody&#8212;. [Laughs] One time we were taking a mattress and it was on top of a truck and the mattress flew off. I mean we were&#8212;. We didn&#8217;t know much.  JF: And this was before you went to law school? This was in the &#8217;60s?  DS: Oh yeah, yeah, long before, but it&#8217;s what culminated in my knowledge of how people struggle. I remember&#8212;. [Laughs] Oh, God. It&#8217;s just so amazing the outlook. One time, and I don&#8217;t know why, I drove up to this desolate home of a person I still have contact with. She was about to have a baby and she lived miles away from a hospital, so I took her to the hospital and barely made it. She&#8217;d never been to a doctor. I mean she didn&#8217;t have money to go to a doctor. She says I did this twice but I only remember one, and why I was there I don&#8217;t know. Another time I was at her father&#8217;s house and he was in the middle of having a heart attack and he was sitting on the only chair, they only had one chair in their house, and he got up so I could sit down in his chair.  JF: Oh my gosh.  DS: Ah! So we took him to the doctor, and again it was just circumstance that I was there. My friend, Betsy, who worked for me when I became a lawyer and we&#8217;ve been friends for over thirty years, she and I did a lot of this, organizing communities. I&#8217;ve got pictures and pictures and articles on this stuff. It made the newspaper. I&#8217;m telling you I think if I&#8217;d been a newspaper reader I would have been tired of seeing my picture.  JF: [Laughs]  DS: Some of the stories kind of touched people. Let&#8217;s see if I can&#8212;.I worked with a man, and I can&#8217;t remember what that program was called, but I know one thing we did was make an IQ test with things that these rural men knew the answers to and then we took it to, quote, educated people [Laughs] who&#8217;d never heard of the questions, much less knew the answers.  JF: [Laughs]  DS: I really don&#8217;t remember the name, and once I get through that stack I&#8217;ll remember, but that was really fun and it made the men feel like they were: Okay; so I know something and nobody else knows the answer to that. I don&#8217;t know. By the time I get through that box of stuff my memory will be primed. One of my friends or I were out every day. My kids were young and they are so grateful because I took them with me and they would play with children that had only a dirt floor in their house. They learned about playing in streams and found very early that people are fun, that black&#8212;. I mean they spent a lot of time in the black community but also in the rural area that had nothing. Well it&#8217;s wrong to say they had nothing because they had a lot in who they were as people, but so far as&#8212;I don&#8217;t know&#8212;things like paper over windows and nothing to keep warm in the winter.   We did some art programs in the summer, the art center. We organized art where kids could come and paint in the summer. I don&#8217;t know what we didn&#8217;t do, frankly. We started a transportation program because one of the awful things is they didn&#8217;t have cars, didn&#8217;t have transportation, so we got one of the university professors&#8212;. We didn&#8217;t know what we were doing, and we did have a transportation program going for a while. It didn&#8217;t last; that&#8217;s too complicated.   In the rural mountain area women particularly needed friendship. I think women depend on conversation and friendship and many of the houses were far apart and women just didn&#8217;t have anybody to talk to. You know the other organization that was absolutely wonderful was Planned Parenthood.  JF: Okay. I was going to ask if these women asked about birth control and women&#8217;s healthcare.  DS: They didn&#8217;t ask about it. We all went and made friends and through that&#8212;because women didn&#8217;t ask about things like that, that was private, and women had many children, not necessarily because it was by choice.   JF: How did you start conversations like that with them? Did you just have to work your way up to it?  DS: Well you were just people and you began talking, and talking about health. Teeth: Oh, the condition of teeth; just awful, just awful. For awhile they had programs where they would tell you what was wrong but there was no way to do anything about it. You could be told you&#8217;ve got to have that tooth taken care of but it you didn&#8217;t have a dentist where would you go? The dentists would go around but the people couldn&#8217;t get in to them.   Oh, another thing, [Laughs] there was what was called the smallest library in the world and it was this little community in Morgan County and the library was about from that side of the&#8212;about that side of the whatchamacallit out to maybe here and back there.  JF: That&#8217;s tiny.  DS: That was the library.  JF: It&#8217;s like the size of maybe&#8212;. I&#8217;ve seen closets in homes that are that big. [Laughs]  DS: Maybe two little closets; it would be about that big.  JF: Wow.  DS: And we gathered books. This woman had this little library forever. I mean it was so wonderful for the kids.  JF: It was run by a local woman?  DS: Yeah. Oh, she was wonderful.  JF: Did she start it before the Community Action program?  DS: Yes, yes.  JF: Oh wow.  DS: Yeah. Oh, it was wonderful. She was a wonderful woman. So we did help them get a greater variety of books.   Let&#8217;s see; what else can I think of? I wish I&#8217;d had time to go through that whole stack. That Community Action and League of Women Voters, that box is full of stuff.   JF: You started the Rural Legal Services?  DS: Yeah.  JF: Can you tell me about that?  DS: Oh, yeah. I was their chairperson for over twenty-five years, I think, and that, of course the purpose was to provide services to poor people. The attempt was for it to be based on the need of the people and so a lot of us went around and talked to people about what they saw as their needs, and of course they were better housing, toilets, running water. Do you know about Marie Cirillo?   JF: I&#8217;ve heard of her, yeah, the Glenmary nun who formed FOCIS?  DS: Yeah, she&#8217;s done wonderful things in the upper east, community based, the community making the decision, the community owning the property.  JF: Did you know her well? Did you work with her?  DS: Yeah. The law takes over and you don&#8217;t get to do some of the things that you would like to do with your friends, but I hear from her all the time by letter. She&#8217;s a wonderful woman. So she was one of our early friends. [Laughs] When we first met her&#8212;. We&#8217;re martini lovers. Every Friday night we&#8217;ve had a date for thirty years, watching a movie and having a martini. The first time we met her she had a martini at our house. Oh, we had&#8212;. She&#8217;s fun. She&#8217;s not one of those who&#8217;s going to preach to you or even [let you] know that she was once a nun. She&#8217;s delightful.  JF: So the Rural Legal Services started in the mid &#8217;70s?  DS: Whenever the law passed. It established legal services so it became federally funded, and I don&#8217;t know the year, but it must have been around &#8217;64.   JF: Okay.  DS: It must have been around then. As usual the Democrats initiated it and were very good about not regulating what they could do. Now once the Republicans came in they cut what they can do, they can&#8217;t collect any money, even if they win a huge settlement they don&#8217;t get the money, so that means they&#8217;re dependent on federal funding and when you don&#8217;t have federal funding then your program has to be cut. There are so many women here who need a divorce, I mean desperately need a divorce and don&#8217;t have the money for it, and the Republicans took away the right of women&#8212;. You have to be abused, physically, before they can represent you, so there are women that need&#8212;. Not that I think divorce is the answer to everything but a bad marriage is pretty bad. So actually there is a wonderful organization in Nashville that is privately operated and is basically what Legal Services was intended to be. They take whatever is not treating people equally. They&#8217;re wonderful. [The director of this program]&#8212;I should know his first name&#8212;is head of it and he&#8217;s fearless. He&#8217;s fearless, and can be because he depends on contributions; very, very successful and wonderful man.   We started about Rural Legal. They did a lot&#8212;. [Pause] They do a lot now for TennCare, when TennCare came in. One of the lawyers, Lenny Croce, knows more about the TennCare program than the people who run it, and battles for people to be accepted under the TennCare program. A lot of very bad housing here, Knoxville, Oak Ridge, rural areas, awful housing, and they&#8217;ve been trying to destroy some of it but of course the law protects the owner, but they&#8217;ve done a lot on evictions. Just in any area where a human being is not treated properly; but they are quite restricted. But it&#8217;s a wonderful program. It does provide help but they&#8217;re limited.  JF: So it sounds like the 1964 Johnson administration really did a lot for rural poverty but from the late &#8217;70s on it&#8217;s been rolled back?  DS: Every time the Republicans have been in control all support for poor people goes down. It&#8217;s amazing, it&#8217;s amazing. And every time the Democrats are in, support goes up and our deficit goes down. Now why Republicans are considered monetarily wise&#8212;. There&#8217;s a great book, the blue one. It shows the facts. I know this isn&#8217;t supposed to be political but it shows the facts of when Republicans are in power and Democrats. When Democrats are in power our debt goes down, our support for those disadvantaged goes up, and the difference in income goes down. When the Republicans are in charge the difference in income level goes up, support for the poor goes down, and our deficit goes up. He has shown that with figures, not with political language, and I don&#8217;t know how they get the name &#8220;fiscally responsible.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know.   JF: You can be political; that&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s no problem. [Laughs]  DS: Okay. [Laughs] But there&#8217;s a great chart in that book that shows&#8212;. It&#8217;s not a book that says this is right and this is wrong. It&#8217;s a book taking actual figures of when Republicans versus Democrats are in power. It&#8217;s just amazing, and I don&#8217;t know&#8212;. It&#8217;s the English language. The Democrats don&#8217;t know how to use words that get to people&#8217;s heart and the Republicans have very good use of language&#8212;motherhood and apple pie&#8212;and it doesn&#8217;t make any difference what the facts are. It bothers me a lot that we&#8217;re so easily fooled. We&#8217;re very easily fooled. We&#8217;ll buy somebody&#8217;s words. You can tell I&#8217;ve got Mr. Obama in the corner.  JF: Yes. There&#8217;s a huge, life size cutout of President Obama in Ms. Stulberg&#8217;s living room.  DS: [Laughs] My son-in-law brought that to me. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  DS: For him it was a joke; for me it was wonderful. Anyway.  JF: You&#8217;ve mentioned a lot with the Community Action program work. You use the word &#8220;fun&#8221; a lot, that you had fun with these women and the activities that you did with the kids were fun. It sounds like that was a really important part of what was going on.  DS: Oh, I don&#8217;t do much that I don&#8217;t think is fun. You know it comes back to you, and to see children or a mother&#8212;but it was like friends. It wasn&#8217;t like, oh, you poor thing. None of that. I never put down. I never felt anybody was less valuable. In fact for some of them I think they would survive a third world war and I wouldn&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t know how to grow anything and they have a way of&#8212;.There&#8217;s some knowledge that people who struggle against poverty [have]. In fact many of them learn to cheat.  JF: What was that?  DS: Many of them learn to cheat.  JF: To cheat?  DS: Yeah.  JF: It&#8217;s a survival skill.  DS: Yeah. I think we set it up so that people break the law. I think I&#8217;d smoke marijuana. Big deal.   JF: Or grow it and sell it, if you needed to make money.  DS: Yeah. What would you do if you had nothing, nothing to eat, the necessities? I don&#8217;t mean nothing, like a huge house, but if you had no future. I don&#8217;t know. Anyway, we do poorly by people. We send too many people to prison. Actually when I went back&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know if you know but I got my doctorate while I was a full time lawyer and I went back because&#8212;. I shouldn&#8217;t say I went back because I still practiced but I went to school and got my degree in 2004. Is that right? I&#8217;m not quite sure. But anyway, I went back because I saw what prison did to my young friends I represented. I mean that&#8217;s the end of your life. You have a felony, nobody will hire you, you spend&#8212;particularly for young black men, they&#8217;re easy to arrest and no support and easy to break into their house, easy to stop them in the car, and mostly the ones I represented were between eighteen and twenty-two. Those are the growing years of young people. [After a conviction] they can&#8217;t vote. People wouldn&#8217;t hire them.  So when I went back to school I felt we&#8217;ve got to do something. I went into business thinking business could consider these young people, women and men, as assets and use them&#8212;use, wrong word&#8212;but make them an asset so when they come out&#8212;or not send them but help them grow during those years. But then I discovered that changing prisons was not the answer. You have to change education, health, possibilities, so then I went into a collaborative learning program where maybe you could get people to talk together and find better solutions. It&#8217;s the opposite of what&#8217;s going on now but there&#8217;s an undercurrent going on. We have a wonderful Tennessee Supreme Court, three women: Five member; three women.  JF: Wow.  DS: It&#8217;s amazing, and they&#8217;re wonderful, and the men are good. They are so determined that legal aid be out there for everybody and they&#8217;re very supportive of this teaching and learning center that I was telling you about. They&#8217;re putting their name on one of the big programs they&#8217;re starting. So there are these ripples underneath, but, oh, what&#8217;s happening legally is so, so embarrassing, but not with [Tennessee] supreme court, ours. Now the US Supreme Court is humiliating. It&#8217;s humiliating. Anyway.  JF: Let me pause for a minute and we&#8217;ll skip to the next track. [Break in recording]  DS: Most of the schools around here do not have softball or baseball for girls, and this one girl was determined she be on the team, the boys&#8217; team. They didn&#8217;t have girls and under Title IX, by golly, she was entitled to be on their team. Really, really funny: One of the judges I just loved and nobody else liked was the federal judge and we went before him and said, by golly, she had a right. Well he [Laughs] made them let her play baseball and it was so funny because Judge Taylor loved baseball. He loved baseball and he said, &#8220;Baseball is an intelligent game. It&#8217;s not a game of who hits who, it&#8217;s an intelligent game, and girls are as intelligent.&#8221; I mean it was amazing. Well she never&#8212;.  JF: About when was this? Do you remember when this was?  DS: It&#8217;s in that stack.  JF: &#8217;70s or &#8217;80s?  DS: No. No, it was later than that, but that was a real win, even though it happened, and of course it slowly happens and it was the end of the season, but she got to dress up the last game, and oh, I mean that was a little victory but it was a big victory. It was a big victory applying Title IX for women. One of the cases that I guess is probably the best, the most forward looking and effective case was the full court.  JF: The basketball case?  DS: Mm hmm. We went to the same judge and said there&#8217;s no reason girls can&#8217;t run up and down on a floor. Well our wonderful TSSAA took us to the court of appeals, saying girls should not run up and down the court, and the court of appeals upheld them and said&#8212;oh, I&#8217;ll never forget it. The judge said, &#8220;This could harm the women&#8217;s reproductive organs,&#8221; and I thought that&#8217;s all we&#8217;re for? I mean if that was not an example of&#8212;. That must have been probably&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m going to put together a timeline and I&#8217;ve got the cases, the decisions. So we didn&#8217;t have enough money to go to the Supreme Court. We would have won on the Supreme Court, but it&#8217;s so expensive.  JF: [Break in recording] You were representing a young girl who wanted to play full court basketball but Tennessee high school said girls&#8217; basketball has to be half court.   DS: Right, and Pat Head Summitt testified, said she would not hire people from Tennessee because, by golly, she wasn&#8217;t going to have to teach half the game, and that was it. Judge Taylor locally agreed and so that was what we thought was a wonderful win and we thought surely TSSAA would accept that, but they didn&#8217;t.  JF: What was the TSSAA?  DS: Hmm?  JF: What&#8217;s the TSSAA?  DS: Tennessee&#8212;. [Pause]  JF: Is it the athletic&#8212;?  DS: Athletic association, Tennessee&#8212;.  JF: That&#8217;s okay; I can look it up. Yeah, it&#8217;s the athletic association for the state.  DS: Anyway, Susie and I&#8212;. Susie was not a lawyer; I was the lawyer.  JF: And this is Susie Shuberg?  DS: Shugart.  JF: Shugart.  DS: Her mother&#8212;.  JF: Nan Shugart was the girl you represented?  DS: Yeah. No, no. We didn&#8217;t represent anybody. We just said Title IX should be applied and that women could run the full court. Oh, and they boo-hooed us, the local school board boo-hooed us and of course we lost the court [decision]. We weren&#8217;t going to give up so that&#8217;s when we went to the Civil Rights Commission and at that time we were not necessarily after the full court because the law had decided we couldn&#8217;t go full court, so we went to them on track. The track girls didn&#8217;t have workouts. They didn&#8217;t have letter jackets, although they always won. Boys got letter jackets and never went to the state. The boys got the track first and if it wasn&#8217;t busy the girls could. The coaches didn&#8217;t get paid any money. So we went to them on that issue. We couldn&#8217;t go to them on the issue of full court but the wonderful&#8212;. I wish I could find that woman. I&#8217;ve tried to find her. The woman and a man were fantastic. We prepared all the information and petitioned them to come and make Oak Ridge follow Title IX.   Well when they came up here they said full court, that it was discrimination, and that isn&#8217;t what&#8212;. We were just after the school applying Title IX, and as I say we couldn&#8217;t actually appeal the full court because the court of appeals had said no. They made them give the girls letter jackets, they made them give them warm ups, they had to be able to use the track at equal time, the coaches had to be paid, and full court basketball, just like that. So Oak Ridge was the only school and would have nobody to play but it turns out that almost everybody wanted full court so finally TSSAA voted that there should be full court basketball.   So it&#8217;s just ironic, really. We got it through the back door. It&#8217;s how things work, but you just don&#8217;t give up. You try to find a way that speaks the language of people. Some of the coaches across the state were against it but the reason was that they knew the split court game and they knew the rules and many of them had been coaches for a long time and shifting to full court is different. And I&#8217;ll tell you, when we were at the court of appeals and that judge said it could hurt your productive organs it made us look like nothing but somebody who&#8217;s going to produce more children. That&#8217;s our role. I stood up and was going to walk out but I knew&#8212;. Actually my partner did the argument in the court of appeals, and I knew if I stood up and walked out I would be in contempt so I sat down, but, oh, it was hard to hear. It was really hard to hear.  JF: It&#8217;s hard to hear now.   DS: Yeah. So anyway, the Civil Rights Commission did it for us.  JF: That group, is that the Tennessee Human Rights Commission?  DS: No, federal.  JF: It&#8217;s a federal civil rights commission?  DS: Mm hmm.  JF: Okay.  DS: Out of Atlanta, and they came&#8212;Marge Justice. I don&#8217;t remember the man but he was just as important as she was. Marge Justice was as straightforward. I do have a copy of what they demanded Oak Ridge do. I have all that stuff in there and I&#8217;m trying to figure out a way to&#8212;. I mean it&#8217;s the history of women&#8217;s rights in Tennessee. I think Title IX has done more for women than anything because I think competition and the camaraderie&#8212;is that a word?&#8212;in playing with a team, and competition, and learning to lose, learning to work together, in my opinion it&#8217;s one of the most important things that&#8217;s happened. When you think of the physical condition of girls, if they learn the sport, any sport&#8212;. That&#8217;s where my husband is now. He&#8217;s off to gamble and to go to the Lady Vols softball tournament.  JF: [Laughs]  DS: [Laughs] That&#8217;s his birthday present.  JF: Now I spoke with Gloria Ray, who was the first women&#8217;s athletic director at UT.  DS: Oh!  JF: Did you know her?  DS: Oh, I admire her. I really admire her. If anybody has shown what women can do as a model to look at, she&#8217;s it. Oh, yeah, we&#8217;ve known her. Mel and I and two other people formed the Lady Vols Booster Club, just a group of people. We went to a game in South Carolina, I think, and we rode a bus over and back and on the bus coming back we decided we were going to form a booster club, so as soon as we got back we met and I wrote the bylaws. But we were a private group, but the opportunities out of a booster club&#8212;. The women needed money and we weren&#8217;t money raisers, although we tried, but then the university decided that the booster club should be authorized by them, and they raised millions.  JF: Wow.  DS: It made us a little unhappy because we felt ownership, you know, but what it&#8217;s done for women&#8217;s athletics is just amazing. So we were the beginning of that. That was back when Pat had to drive the teams to the games; the men flew. It&#8217;s when they bought one pair of shoes for the women; bought many for the men. Pat and the team had to wash the clothes. Imagine.  JF: They had no support.  DS: None, and so when we got this booster club going that was part of the&#8212;. Now it&#8217;s basically world renowned. It&#8217;s so honest. The women have to sit in the first three rows. They cannot miss a class unless they notify Pat and there&#8217;s a reason. If they have a hard test the next day they don&#8217;t go out of town to the game. Athletics is second, and they all graduate.   JF: That&#8217;s so different from male college athletes.  DS: Part of it is what the world is like. The men have a place to go to make a load of money, okay, so if you can come and spend a year at college and show off your ability&#8212;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do if I had a million dollar contract. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do, especially since most of these young men come from poor families and a lot of them use their money to buy their mother a house. So you can understand, and also you can understand because male athletes are pushed through school. They don&#8217;t have to be good. They&#8217;ll get passed. So thank heaven they don&#8217;t do that to women. I hope that never happens.   JF: Were there any negative reactions? What kind of negative reactions were there to the Lady Vols when they first started?  DS: When they first&#8212;there was none. There may be fifty of us there to watch the game, yeah. It&#8217;s such an honest, respectable, and Pat is really the one who made basketball acceptable. She started the competition. Now there was a lot of negative reaction to full court. You should read some of the letters to the editor. I mean, oh, not only was the decision horrible&#8212;government interfering&#8212;but Susie Shugart and I were running everything, and I got thrown out of the chancellor&#8217;s office and I got thrown out of the board that controls, you know, what disciplines you can have, when I was battling for equal things for the women&#8217;s team.  JF: Like physically thrown out?  DS: Well I was told there was another meeting, and they wouldn&#8217;t even let Susie in with me. The chancellor made me come in the office by myself with an attorney. I wasn&#8217;t an attorney then. By being thrown out I mean they said the meeting is over. Now they talk about how good the administration is. Pooh. They were awful, and TSSAA was awful. I mean they just looked on you like you were nothing but a troublemaker, who would want full court.   But you know it&#8217;s fun to battle. It really is fun to battle when you know darn well you&#8217;re right. It just was fun. Even losing, if you knew you were right and you did the best job you could do, I would say it&#8217;s fun. Wonderful years, wonderful years, ever since &#8217;64. I think I just came alive when I realized&#8212;I know I did. I became aware of&#8212;. I just was not aware of poverty, period. In the North segregation was not a big issue. I know it wasn&#8217;t equal but it was not a big issue. But coming to the South was&#8212;. I&#8217;ll never get used to it. I&#8217;ll never get used to the culture here. I&#8217;ll never get used to it.  JF: What parts of the culture?  DS: People tell you through the church what you&#8217;re supposed to do and what you&#8217;re not supposed to do, and the biases. The Presbyterian church here, the big one here, a woman is not qualified to teach a man anything about the Bible. She can teach women and teach children, not men. The first question asked when you meet somebody new is: What church do you go to? And things like same sex marriage; people are so afraid of that.   JF: I remember hearing that one of the negative reactions to the Lady Vols was that it would make the women manly or encourage lesbianism.   DS: Yes.  JF: Did you get any of that?  DS: Yeah, but people wouldn&#8217;t dare say that to me, really. I mean nobody ever said that directly to me, but I know that was a part of the under attitude. Anything that&#8217;s&#8212;. I mean women are second class here in general except Lady Vols basketball is way on top of the mountain, but it&#8217;s a struggle here. I had a dear friend who teaches in the religion department at UT. She finally left. She moved to Wales. She just couldn&#8217;t understand this blindness, which was blindness to her because she knew the history of religion and the things that had happened. And there still is discrimination against blacks, particularly black women.   JF: Did you have any cases?  DS: Oh yeah.  JF: Can you tell me about some of them, or if you need to keep it anonymous for confidentiality I understand.  DS: I don&#8217;t know if I can think of&#8212;. If something has been published, the decision has been published. I could tell you one that&#8217;s real good, but this is a man.   JF: Okay.  DS: A black man who one of the school systems&#8212;and I&#8217;m not remembering which county but one of the adjacent counties. [He] was apparently an excellent teacher in&#8212;what&#8217;s the opposite of home ec?  JF: Shop?  DS: Yeah, shop. He apparently was very good and they terminated him and we went to court and he got his job back and I got a call from the principal of the school saying it was the best thing that ever happened to them, that he was a great contributor and he was really glad that we had done it.   I&#8217;ve got another example of that. TVA, we represented an African American I guess just laborer because the people around him made comments [and] gave him the dirty work to do, and we sued his boss, and that boss I&#8217;m still friends with. He was found the discriminator. He has said that he was not aware. That it was right in front of him, he saw it happen, but it was just one of those things, and he said that being found a person who discriminates just kills him because he did not know&#8212;. It just killed him. He did not know what he was letting happen and he was grateful, and we&#8217;re still friends. I hear from him every Christmas. So it&#8217;s not always that people are mean, it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re uneducated, unaware, just like I was when I came down here. I didn&#8217;t know people got treated that way. But when I saw it I saw it, and he had lived with it because he&#8217;s from this part of the country, so saying something unkind, that&#8217;s life. But the guy kept his job and was never treated like that again, so some of those things make you feel really good. It doesn&#8217;t always work that way so you lose a lot of discrimination cases. It&#8217;s not easy to prove.   But, let&#8217;s see. [Pause] Women were harder. I probably had more women losers than men losers, and I&#8217;m not sure why. I guess it&#8217;s easier to support a man, a breadwinner. I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know. I have to think about that, because I always just took a case and a case and a case and didn&#8217;t go back to why. I lost that one so I&#8217;m not going to lose another one. Thirty-five years of representing people. [Pause]   I know one that I lost that was against the laboratory, darling, darling, darling black woman, but I still hear from her. I just got a note; she&#8217;s going to Africa to do some teaching. I guess the wonderful thing is if you really tried and you really believed your client at least there was a chance for them to speak, so I don&#8217;t think anybody was ever angry at me when we lost. And when I made a mistake I said I made a mistake. It&#8217;s hard not to make a mistake. But all in all I felt I did some good.  JF: When you said that more women seemed to lose discrimination cases than men it reminded me of the battle for the Equal Rights Amendment. Were you involved with that?  DS: Yes. Oh, yeah, I wore the bracelet. I&#8217;ve got the bracelet. Oh yeah.  JF: What was the bracelet like?  DS: With ERA on it. In fact I wore it the other day [Laughs] and it&#8217;s really interesting, one of the young men, an African American man who&#8217;s a friend of mine, looked at it and he said, &#8220;Oh, Equal Rights Amendment,&#8221; and I thought [Squeals] great! Fantastic! Yeah, oh yeah.  JF: So my understanding is that Tennessee ratified the amendment and then rescinded.  DS: No. I don&#8217;t think they&#8212;. I mean it passed, yeah, with one vote, and because of his mother.  JF: Oh, the suffrage amendment.  DS: Oh, yes, I&#8217;m sorry.  JF: No, you&#8217;re right; Tennessee was the deciding vote, and it was because of the man&#8217;s mother. That&#8217;s a great story, isn&#8217;t it?  DS: A great story. I slipped a gear on that one.  JF: [Laughs]  DS: That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s a wonderful story. [Laughs]  JF: It&#8217;s a much better ending than the ERA.  DS: Yeah.  JF: Why do you think it was so hard to push for the ERA?  DS: Well women aren&#8217;t as good as men.  JF: [Laughs]  DS: What&#8217;s wrong with you? Women are emotional and belong in the home. They raise our children. I really think it&#8217;s part of the culture.  JF: What did you think of Phyllis Schlafly and those women?  DS: [Laughs] You don&#8217;t have to ask me that question. Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Some people are just there to get their name&#8212;and have different experiences. I can understand. Children should come first, and I think you&#8217;re given a gift and you sure as heck better take care of it, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t work. My daughter lives over across the street, or down a couple blocks, the best mother I&#8217;ve ever seen, has raised two beautiful, wonderful, caring children. The girl is twenty-one and the boy is seventeen. She has worked all their life. She goes out of town quite a bit. She would not have been a good mother if she didn&#8217;t work; she&#8217;s too bright. But the children were always first, and I think if you&#8217;re going to have kids you have part of making or breaking them. I mean I do agree with that and if a mother is more comfortable being home, so what? Let her. I mean I was home when my kids were growing up and did what I did, almost work because I did so much volunteer stuff. I just think the children are the most important. Family is so important. What&#8217;s happening to a lot of the low income kids is they don&#8217;t have that support, education wise. The schools are not good.  JF: And I was thinking when you talked about how many young black men are imprisoned between the ages of eighteen and thirty, that&#8217;s got to put such a stress on black families, young black women who have little children and no income support, no emotional support.  DS: Yeah, and you know the single mothers with income and support are okay but if you&#8217;re a single mother and maybe on welfare, maybe don&#8217;t have your high school diploma, being a single mother is almost impossible. You can&#8217;t afford daycare. I have a keeper. They won&#8217;t allow me to be alone&#8212;my good friend is here&#8212;because I guess the chance of falling. I see these keepers, obviously without education, poor, how many times the car has broken down coming here. Most of them&#8212;one I don&#8217;t like&#8212;they would be bright enough to be a better caretaker if they had help. Berta has this friend that she introduced me to last night who if he hadn&#8217;t had her as a mentor&#8212;. She&#8217;s hearing me. He just graduated from college, got his bachelor&#8217;s, and she&#8217;s still encouraging him. Well if you don&#8217;t have that&#8212;.  JF: No skills or no training.  DS: Yeah, or somebody to pat you on the head. That&#8217;s what I found. So many of my clients, nobody said: You&#8217;re okay. Nobody made them feel&#8212;. Oh, I&#8217;ll tell you another case I had that was fun. I got the first woman in a big labor union coal mine.  JF: Oh yeah?  DS: Yeah.  JF: Was that with the Coal Employment Project?  DS: No, but I know her, Betty, Betty&#8212;Betty something. No. I just took it to court.   JF: Did she come to you looking for a lawyer or did you hear about her trying to&#8212;?  DS: She came to me, and because in Tennessee at that time the only job for women was working on textiles and it was periodic, very hard work, very hard work, and not much pay, but if you could get a job in the unionized coal mines, boy, you made money. So we went to court for her but it was not pleasant for her. I mean she stuck it out, but the struggle. She would get things in her lunchbox and people made remarks, but she stuck it out and she needed the money. So that was another movement, and I&#8217;m assuming that other women have gone into the mine. But that was my dear Judge Taylor that nobody else liked.  JF: Can you tell me a little more about representing that woman in the coal mine case? What was the union&#8217;s reaction? Were they in support?  DS: Oh, no, no, no. Well of course when you think about it the culture was that women do not go in coal mines. I got to go into one before all this happened but not very far. They said it was unusual to let a woman go as far as I went; creepy. You have to be a certain kind of person to want work in the coal mines, or just true necessity. But what it felt like, it was right. If women wanted to work in the coal mines they should be able to work in the coal mines. If they couldn&#8217;t do it or didn&#8217;t have the strength, okay, but if they could do it, and most of it is by machinery now, not a lot of physical. But, oh, my goodness, I can&#8217;t imagine wanting to. But it was only fair.   So I guess&#8212;. You know I never&#8212;. I&#8217;m not a planner ahead. If she came and wanted to go in the coal mines, okay, we&#8217;ll try. If it doesn&#8217;t work it doesn&#8217;t work. But I never planned. I never planned to be a lawyer. I really&#8212;in fact I don&#8217;t really think I was. This great Judge Taylor that nobody liked, [Laughs] one time I walked in and he said, &#8220;When are you ever going to come with a legal case?&#8221; and he called me a social worker. He was always kind to me. I can tell you a story about that, which doesn&#8217;t quite fit you, but Judge Taylor&#8217;s daughter is Ann Taylor, the announcer on NPR.   JF: Okay.  DS: Ann Taylor. Her voice is most unusual. Once you identify it you&#8217;ll remember it. It&#8217;s his daughter. One of the judges here wrote a book about Judge Taylor and it was all so negative, and he was a tough guy. I mean you got your case prepared and there to try it and that was it, and that&#8217;s what he should do. All the lawyers around who were before him wrote something and I wrote a couple things that were in the book and when they had a reception for the book when it was published Ann Taylor and her brother were there and they sought me out because mine were the only positive things about him. That made me feel really good because he was so honest, so nonpolitical, and I had several examples where he went beyond the law to make something fair. One time we had a discrimination case and he said, &#8220;You know you&#8217;re not going to win.&#8221; Oh, that&#8217;s funny. I didn&#8217;t remember this, but an attorney wrote it. He was on the other side, he was the defendant, and I don&#8217;t remember which case&#8212;. I didn&#8217;t remember doing it. The judge said, &#8220;You know you&#8217;re not going to win this. You&#8217;ve read the Supreme Court case,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s time you judges stood up to some of those things,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I agree,&#8221; and we won the darn case.   JF: Wow.  DS: [Laughs] Those funny, funny things just happened. One time he&#8212;. Let&#8217;s see, was that the same&#8212;? No. That we won legitimately. Another time we were in trouble and he said to the other attorney and to me, &#8220;You two go into my chambers and you work this out.&#8221; No law behind us; fairness behind us. So we went into his chambers; darned if we didn&#8217;t negotiate a conclusion. She kept her job, got a raise. [Laughs] Not because the law said to but because Judge Taylor said you go into my chambers and you work this out. That kind of human being&#8212;. That&#8217;s what the law is about. The law is to get fairness. So I had such a different feeling about [him]. I just loved Judge Taylor.   JF: I like that comment, that he called you a social worker not a lawyer.  DS: Yeah. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] I&#8217;m sure so many of your clients that you&#8217;ve helped felt that you did more for them as a lawyer than social workers did as social workers.  DS: It&#8217;s funny. All the other attorneys, you know I was so much older than anybody else, and I can say that the attorneys were not&#8212;. One of them was kind of condescending but he was one of my favorite attorneys. I wore a dress and the skirt I wore had a slit up here and this crazy Roger said to the judge, &#8220;Could we approach the bench, please?&#8221; and he said, &#8220;Would you please tell her that [Laughs] she&#8217;s distracting the jury.&#8221; [Laughs] Now this was funny. This was not&#8212;. He was not being mean, he was being funny, and I loved him. He had a wonderful sense of humor, and it was not demeaning. I had beautiful legs, [Laughs] back in those days, and the lawyers always teased me about my legs. Now you could say that was discrimination. I did not consider that&#8212;. And I always got hugs. It was the way people did it. I&#8217;ll never forget him, and of course I knew the judge well, and I could hardly keep from just exploding with laughter. [Laughs] Oh, God.   There&#8217;s so many things in thirty-five years that are going to happen, and I can say I don&#8217;t regret. I regret losing when I think we were right but I don&#8217;t regret trying. Good years. I didn&#8217;t want to leave, but your mind doesn&#8217;t go as quick. It just doesn&#8217;t click. Words don&#8217;t come as easy and you have to be able to speak on your feet to whatever the words are that come out of your client. Sometimes your client says things on the stand that they&#8217;ve never said to you&#8212;or the opposite&#8212;and you have to be quick enough to figure out whether they really mean what they said or whether you should ask for a break. You have to be quick.   I&#8217;m thinking of another case of a woman truck driver and I can&#8217;t remember&#8212;. It was discrimination and the jury was on our side and we won that case. I&#8217;m not remembering what the discrimination was. I think she was terminated for something that men did, but I&#8217;m not remembering. But that was a nice win.   It&#8217;s going to be fun to go through that.  JF: Mm hmm.  DS: My whole life is documented. I started in kindergarten keeping things, not for any reason, I just collected things. So I&#8217;ve got kindergarten, junior high, high school, I went to Purdue for awhile, I&#8217;ve got that, and I have my college and sorority time, and then I&#8217;ve got all the stuff from the volunteer stuff in that bottom box, and then of course my legal career is documented because it&#8217;s all in the law books, so my whole life is there. It&#8217;s really fun.  JF: Do you know where you want your papers to go?  DS: Well no, because I don&#8217;t know where they should. Berta and I are trying to figure out a way to keep the newspapers. A lot of the things I keep, now that I&#8217;m organizing it, I put in those plastic covers, but they&#8217;re short and the newspaper articles are long so we&#8217;re trying to figure out what I could put them in. But the reason I&#8217;m doing this is for my kids and I don&#8217;t want them to have to throw out stuff or go through stuff.  JF: Well don&#8217;t throw anything out. [Laughs]  DS: [Laughs]   JF: The Southern Historical Collection at UNC I&#8217;m sure would&#8212;.  DS: Would they want it?  JF: I would think so. I can be in touch with you about that. I&#8217;ll talk to the archivist there.  DS: Okay. Especially I think how we got around the split court and the struggle we went through; it seems to me that&#8217;s rather historic. There were five states at that time, and I even ended up in the Des Moines Register, but that&#8217;s very interesting. Girls&#8217; basketball in Iowa, split court, was the game, the game. At the finals they honored the winning team and they wore gowns, and carried flowers, and music, extremely popular. So when I started this thing about full court they didn&#8217;t like it and Mr. Cooley, bless his heart, had built this program to a huge moneymaker and huge popularity, and of course he wouldn&#8217;t want it to go to full court, and boy did he fight it, [Laughs] very nicely, very nicely. But it wasn&#8217;t long until full court came to all the states.   Anyway, it&#8217;s quite a journey, it&#8217;s quite a journey. I&#8217;m glad you saw Gloria Ray. I should try to think of some other people. When I was healthy we gave big parties together here. I can&#8217;t do that anymore, but let&#8217;s see. Okay, let&#8217;s see who we can think of.  JF: You mentioned Elizabeth Peelle, and she&#8217;s local in Oak Ridge?  DS: Yes, in Oak Ridge. She&#8217;s not real healthy but she sure is brain wise healthy. She&#8217;s wonderful. She&#8217;s one of those real people that you never read about, who does things very quietly.   JF: And you said you have contact information for Nan Shugart?  DS: Yes. Her mother was the one that was with me in the Civil Rights Commission. Do you have any way of finding this Marge Justice? I tried to find her because she and that man were&#8212;. This wouldn&#8217;t have happened without them.   JF: That was the federal Civil Rights Commission?  DS: Hmm?  JF: They were with the federal Civil Rights Commission that forced Oak Ridge to comply?  DS: Yeah.   JF: I can do an internet search and look.  DS: I tried to find her. I called Atlanta, which was the office, and I think they were reluctant to just tell somebody. I think she could still be working because I don&#8217;t think she was any older than I. But anyway.  JF: Were there any people at the University of Tennessee Law that were particularly good about getting young women in the law and getting fair treatment for&#8212;?  DS: As far as professors?  JF: Mm hmm.  DS: The dean right now is marvelous, but of course he&#8217;s not been dean very long. When I was there, there was no effort to get women. I mean we just stuck out. But I don&#8217;t know that anybody has&#8212;. I think women have just done it without being pushed into it, just like in the medical field.   Let me think. I know there are more people. I wish we could find Elizabeth Alexander. She was involved in the integration. Now she would be pretty old but she lives in Oak Ridge.  JF: Was she a student at Oak Ridge when it integrated?  DS: Yeah, integration. She&#8217;s a wonderful woman. One of the very difficult things was the women teachers. They didn&#8217;t have the credentials. I mean it was an all black school, a total black school, in what was known as the Valley, and the teachers lost their jobs. But she did the very best that anybody with the best intentions, but she reminded me of somebody else. [Pause] Oh, somebody told me that what they would like to do is interview the students who went through the integration, and they would be mostly fifty. My kids went through that, the schools were integrated when they were there. It really is not in very good shape right now. Some of the teachers that I talk to, the high achieving is fine but there are not many blacks in the high achieving.   I was on a panel with mothers and fathers of African Americans and they&#8217;re very disturbed because education is looked down on by their children and they don&#8217;t know what to do about it. They don&#8217;t know how to convince them, because they look around and see people who graduate and don&#8217;t get anywhere. And if you&#8217;re an athlete, a male athlete, you get pushed through school without learning. I represented more of those kids who ended up in legal trouble who were great athletes and just pushed through, couldn&#8217;t read, pushed through school because they were good athletes.   JF: What kind of legal trouble did they end up in?  DS: Oh, burglary, mostly burglary, stealing, shoplifting. One wonderful young man, like a stupid eighteen-year-old, went in with a gun to rob and of course he spent time in prison. He admitted it. The interesting thing about him is when he got out of prison he came by the office and said for him prison was the best thing that ever happened; that he became a man. Now, that doesn&#8217;t happen, but it happened because he had a good upbringing and he had a wonderful mother and he goofed. Kids goof. He came in the office not very long ago when I was still working, and he&#8217;s held a job, he&#8217;s got a family, he&#8217;s got children, so I think because of his background. He made friends, the guards liked him. He used every resource they had in the prison; nice guy, a nice guy. I&#8217;ve known his mother for years, back when the Community Action stuff. There were some wonderful people. It&#8217;s not a good place to live. The Valley is not a good place to live.   JF: Is that the black community in Oak Ridge?  DS: Yeah. Open drugs, and really the community isn&#8217;t treated like a well to do white community, totally isolated, and on purpose when it was set up. I don&#8217;t know. Anyway, there are more opportunities for blacks now but not like there should be. It&#8217;s not equal. Government has done the most in hiring and I think that most were women. Often when I was against the federal government it was a woman who was black.  JF: Your client?  DS: Hmm?  JF: Your clients?  DS: No, no, the lawyer.  JF: Oh, the defendant&#8217;s lawyer.  DS: Yeah. And now there&#8217;s some difficulty because many federal employees are being laid off, so that means a lot of the jobs available for women and African Americans are gone.   JF: Well that just reminds me of where we started, when you started off by telling me that your first opportunity was as an engineer during World War II, how much through the long history the federal government has maybe inadvertently helped women.  DS: Yeah, I think so, I think so, and I think it&#8217;s amazing that Title IX passed. It&#8217;s just amazing. [Telephone rings; break in recording]   &#8211;experience with being old and you realize that keeping in touch with the world, you do that with young friends. I think it&#8217;s really important. It&#8217;s worked for me.   JF: [Laughs] Well I just have a couple more questions, if you don&#8217;t mind. I want to know, did you consider yourself a feminist in the &#8217;70s?  DS: No. No, I considered myself an equal-righter. I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re a kid&#8212;. I mean you better see that those kids get what they need. If you&#8217;re a black male you deserve the same protection. So, no, I don&#8217;t&#8212;. It&#8217;s beyond&#8212;. &#8220;Feminist&#8221; is too narrow for me.   JF: What did feminism mean to you in the &#8217;70s?  DS: What did it mean in the &#8217;70s? Burning bras. In a way I agree. I mean I agree with what feminists stand for except first it was white people. It wasn&#8217;t black people included. It wasn&#8217;t black women included. We all wear our whiteness and we still wear our whiteness. You can&#8217;t help it. But I thought it was too narrow. Everybody has to have a chance. Everybody should be able to become the best they want to be and the best they can be. I think that&#8217;s what we owe each other as human beings. I think we&#8217;re all part of the same rock. [Laughs] If you chip a piece off of it and throw it out you diminish me. So I think that answers the question. No, I&#8217;m not. I wasn&#8217;t.   JF: What do you think made the biggest difference for struggles for equal rights? What was the best resource or the biggest change?  DS: Title IX. I think Title IX was a tool for women in more than athletics. So far as the most telling for women I would say Title IX. I think the Equal Opportunity Act made people more aware of poverty. I don&#8217;t think it concentrated on women at all. It was a general approach to opportunity for everybody, but Title IX, I think it was a magnificent law. It isn&#8217;t used as much as it should be and they&#8217;re trying to weaken it. There&#8217;s a real effort. What would you expect? The Republicans are trying pretty hard to say it&#8217;s not fair because the men bring in the money and the women don&#8217;t and it&#8217;s harmful to the men. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about that now. You have to keep fighting. You have to be aware. I love that statement, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re being spit on you don&#8217;t know nothing,&#8221; and if women aren&#8217;t aware that you have to work hard to keep these rights, because men are still dominant. That&#8217;s what I believe.   JF: You mentioned that the churches in the South tend to be very conservative and influence the culture in conservative ways. Were there any churches, like when you worked in Anderson County, that were supporters or that were allies for anti-poverty or anti-discrimination?  DS: The Unitarian church. My husband&#8217;s heritage is Jewish and neither one of us is&#8212;we&#8217;re not religious. We think we&#8217;re what it should be. We both love people and want everybody to have a chance so that&#8217;s our religion. How did I&#8212;? I can&#8217;t remember the question.  JF: Were there any churches that were supporters of the anti-poverty?  DS: The Jewish people do not try to get others to be Jews, and I don&#8217;t think you ever heard a Jewish person ask you what church you go to. There is a wonderful Jewish church here. My friend down the road that comes in often is a wonderful believer. He has a wonderful sense of the world. Let me say, yes. When we needed clothes, where did we go? To the church. When we needed furniture and needed a place to store furniture&#8212;. There is a wonderful Presbyterian church here. In fact half the church members left when they integrated and formed their own church but the church as it remained gave us a place to store the furniture as we collected it. Yes. I think those of us who I would call believers in something different ought to fight for religions that don&#8217;t hurt anybody but fight against religions that diminish people. Yeah, and the Catholic church here has a place for poor people to come.   One reason that I completely left the church, completely, was that one of the big churches asked me to find things that people in the rural areas could use, what they would benefit from, so man did I work. I went all around asking people and there were all kinds of wonderful projects. You know what they decided to do? To buy a bus and bring these poor people into their church on Sunday morning. Here is this church full of wealthy, well dressed people. Can you imagine? They have their own churches. Rural areas have wonderful churches.   JF: This was a church in Oak Ridge&#8212;  DS: Yes.  JF: &#8212;in the &#8217;60s that wanted to bring rural people into their church?  DS: And I just thought that was the most insensitive&#8212;. I just can&#8217;t imagine. And, oh, there were so many things, like there were a lot of doctors that could go out and a lot of lawyers that [could] go out and help, but those weren&#8217;t the projects. The projects were things like helping them fight for better education in the rural areas and ways to do that. I was so disappointed and I thought, uh uh. That&#8217;s not for me. So that was sort of my end of organized religion. It really hurt, really hurt.   I thought of another case. [Pause] It&#8217;ll come back. [Pause] Do you want to see my family?  JF: Mm hmm.  DS: There&#8217;s a woman who struggled. That&#8217;s the Lone Mountain community that wanted to paint mailboxes. So I really treasure that because I think it kind of shows&#8212;. Actually that house is in better shape than many but it was not in good shape. The floors aren&#8217;t very solid, the porch wasn&#8217;t solid, but she was a woman who struggled. She struggled. Obviously no dryer, the roads were not good. That&#8217;s the place where the community got rid of the rat hole, the dump.  JF: The dump? Where did you say this was?  DS: Where is it?  JF: Yeah.  DS: It&#8217;s right outside Norris, and here&#8217;s Norris, this wealthy, wealthy TVA-based town, and this is probably two miles away. It&#8217;s a whole community&#8212;. It used to be segregated and it had a name. Again memory is foggy, but they changed the name of the community to Lone Mountain. The regular community was more fitting for a black community and by now it was black and white so they changed the name, and Lone Mountain is a nice name and they all agreed on it. They had a community meeting and agreed that it would be called Lone Mountain.   JF: Can I take a photograph of that after the interview?  DS: Yeah.  JF: Okay. It&#8217;s a beautiful picture.   DS: I love it. It has so much meaning. I do remember the lady and a number of children, and children with problems, and children with bad health. But she struggled. She did what she could.   JF: Was she from that town? Did she have an education at all?  DS: No.   JF: What did she do to get by?  DS: Hmm?  JF: What did she do to get by, farming?  DS: No.  JF: Wage labor?  DS: They didn&#8217;t have an income. I don&#8217;t remember when food stamps started. Do you remember when food stamps started?  JF: I think in &#8217;64.   DS: Okay, then that&#8217;s what she lived on, was food stamps. It was a lifesaver. But they didn&#8217;t have doctors, no running water, things we take for granted. But I really prize that.  JF: It&#8217;s beautiful. Do you want to wrap up?  DS: Okay.  JF: Is there anything you&#8217;d like to add or anything you thought I&#8217;d ask that I didn&#8217;t?  DS: No. I&#8217;m just glad you&#8217;re doing this because I think it&#8217;s a history that women should be aware of. I think we&#8217;ve got to keep our mind on keeping what we have so far and getting more. You know that they&#8217;re changing the definition of rape, our wonderful Congress? Unless you fight and have bruises it&#8217;s not rape.  JF: Oh my gosh. That&#8217;s appalling.  DS: Appalling. Our Congressman Duncan is the signer on the bill. Can you imagine? And all the organizations to protect women say don&#8217;t fight because you&#8217;re going to be killed, but Duncan in all his wisdom says we&#8217;re changing, because obviously if you don&#8217;t have bruises you wanted it.  JF: Oh my gosh.   DS: Can you imagine? So if we think our rights are well protected we&#8217;re crazy. They&#8217;re not. And if people hadn&#8217;t yelled about Planned Parenthood it would have been gone. That was so stupid. There&#8217;s a video out by a conservative group that Planned Parenthood is the greatest abortion organization, that they kill more babies than any other organization in the country. It&#8217;s a lie. It&#8217;s a lie.
JF: Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard that they give out talking points that tell people that Planned Parenthood teaches children how to have sex.  DS: You know what Knox County has done? They&#8217;ve always had Planned Parenthood do their sex education and now they&#8217;ve said the teachers have to do it and Planned Parenthood can&#8217;t. Teachers are not equipped. They&#8217;re not trained to teach sex education. Planned Parenthood is. But Knox County Schools in all their wisdom said no more Planned Parenthood; &#8220;teachers will do it.&#8221; Teachers have enough to do. Anyway, things are not good, and if we don&#8217;t speak out we&#8217;ll lose it. We&#8217;ll lose what we have. Anyway, life goes this way, but when it goes down you&#8217;ve got to fight for the up, and if you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s gone.   JF: Thank you so much. I really enjoyed talking with you.  DS: Oh, it&#8217;s really fun. I mean I really enjoy it because it&#8217;s history.  JF: Yes, you, your life is history. You have been one of the path breakers and on the front lines.  DS: Without knowing. You know, I never really&#8212;. I would not have said that about me. I would have said I just think everything should be fair and you should not have to be a path breaker. You should just say that&#8217;s how things ought to be.   Anyway, I would never stop talking. I could probably tell you fifteen other cases that made a difference, but it&#8217;s hard to [keep talking].
