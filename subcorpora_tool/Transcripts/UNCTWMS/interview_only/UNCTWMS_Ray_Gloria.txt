JF: It&#8217;s May tenth, 2011. This is Joey Fink with the Southern Oral History Program. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee, interviewing Gloria Ray. Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me. I just wanted to start off by asking you to tell me a little bit about where you are from, where you were born, and where you grew up.
GR: Well, you&#8217;re in Knoxville, Tennessee, and this is where I was born. I grew up in east Tennessee and was born actually here in Knoxville, went to elementary school, junior high and high school here, and I finally decided I needed to go away to go to college; so I did that. But this is my home and it&#8217;s kind of neat in that you then have family and you have roots. So I think it adds a certain sense of substance to who you are as you grow up to have that around you.
JF: And you went to Fulton High School, is that correct?
GR: I went to Fulton High School. It would be considered an inner city school. It was a school that I think took great pride and there was a family atmosphere there. There was a sign out front of the school that said, &#8220;Enter to learn and go forth to serve.&#8221; And I think that the graduates of that school have really taken that to heart and a lot of us are involved in what we think makes a difference or we hope to make a difference in people&#8217;s lives. Coming from an inner city school, there were a lot of challenges and therefore, a lot of opportunities. I feel very blessed to have been there.
JF: What was the makeup of the student body when you were in high school there?
GR: There was about three hundred and fifty in my graduating class. Interestingly, our school, like I said, was an inner city school. We had the first two floors of the school was what was called &#8220;shop.&#8221; You&#8217;d take cosmetology or you&#8217;d take auto work. So you learned a trade as opposed to a college-bound course, which were on the top two floors. The dynamics were very interesting in how those people related to each other. I chose to go into the college prep courses and knew I was going to go on to college, but you learned a respect for those that thought, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s really not in my future. I want to learn a trade.&#8221; I think that helped a lot of us in terms of appreciating people for their different talents and their different contributions. We weren&#8217;t a cookie cutter school, had very good athletic teams. We were all pretty competitive. I think it was an opportunity to grow a little bit and get ready for society before maybe we needed to.
JF: Was the high school integrated?
GR: It was. A very small amount of African Americans at that time.
JF: Would this have been mid-[19]60s?
GR: Yeah. I graduated in [19]65. We had a high school that was predominately a minority school, Austin, and then as I grew older, they changed that to Austin East where they combined. We had a small number of minority students, but primarily it was all Caucasian.
JF: And the difference between the students who chose college prep versus the vo-tech [vocational-technical] kind of classes, was there a noticeable difference between men and women?
GR: No, because the vocational program was pretty broad-based. Actually, it was quite impressive. The cosmetology school put out a lot of young ladies that went on to be hairdressers and cosmetologists. And then there was also they had a segment on radio. So a lot of people learned how to get into the television industry with camera work or we even had some that practiced to be anchors and news reporters and sports reporters. So it offered, you had home economics, but in a different sense. They learned the commercial side of home economics. So it was a different emphasis, but kids were still pretty proud. There was a lot of pride and I think that you will find that probably in east Tennessee, there&#8217;s a lot of pride that I think stands as a motivator for us to do things that maybe others didn&#8217;t think that we could or should do. So I think it&#8217;s okay to be prideful as long as you can back it up. So it was okay.
JF: Generally speaking, what kind of athletic opportunities would be available to a girl or a young woman in the [19]50s and [19]60s?
GR: Totally different in the [19]60s than it is today. I was an athlete and we had a tennis team. So it was okay for young girls to play tennis. So I played tennis and won two state championships because our motto was, or my motto is &#8220;if they keep score, it must matter.&#8221; So I played tennis. Now basketball, for whatever reason, was not an interscholastic sport for girls, nor was volleyball, nor was softball. So tennis was okay, but the others we did through the YWCA through a Y teen program and we had one tournament a year. So I always found that interesting that it was okay to play tennis, but not much else.
JF: And at the YWCA, there was more encouragement to try different sports?
GR: Yeah. We had actually countywide tournaments in basketball and volleyball. It was okay also to swim, but they didn&#8217;t have scholastic teams, but they did have summer teams. It was okay for young girls to swim. I remember growing up and when I turned thirteen, I was at my doctor&#8217;s office and the doctor lived right down the street from where we did. And he called me in and he said, &#8220;Gloria,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve turned thirteen, you can&#8217;t play football anymore.&#8221; I went, &#8220;What happened? Why? Yesterday I could play football, but today I can&#8217;t play football?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, little girls, once they reach thirteen, can&#8217;t play football. But you can play tennis and you can swim and you can dance.&#8221;   He gave me a list of a lot of options that I could do, but I was more curious as to why you couldn&#8217;t do the other and I always figured it was because his son was the backup to me and I figured if he got rid of me, his son could then be the starting quarterback on our football team. But those were just little things growing up that you kind of, at that time, you go, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that. I&#8217;m better than somebody else.&#8221; As I got older, I understood and I didn&#8217;t want to be tackled either, but that should have been my choice to decide not to do that. I&#8217;d have probably been a kicker. I wouldn&#8217;t have been a quarterback because I got hit. So touch football was okay.  JF: What kind of encouragement did you get or did you have role models?  GR: Oh great encouragement from my family and I would also say in the South. They referred to it as, you live in the Bible Belt. There was also a lot of encouragement from your church or your faith-based community, where you went to church, in terms of there were leadership roles for women in that. Now that might have been in the girls&#8217; auxiliary or to be head of the department and plan the programs or you&#8217;re in the singing group and who&#8217;s going to plan what we sing. That tended to be who could do that the best, not a man will do this or a woman will do this. So there was encouragement in that.   There was encouragement at home. My mother worked full-time and had all of her life. My father had died when I was two and so she had raised my brother and I. [My brother] was three years older than I. She raised us with a thing that we would not do without. Whatever we wanted to do, we would do and so therefore, any limitations really were not put on us by the family or it was up to you. Expectations became very, very important. It wasn&#8217;t a matter of &#8220;are you going to go to college?&#8221; It&#8217;s &#8220;which college are you going to go to?&#8221; It was those types of decisions as opposed to, I think, others may have had a different set of support groups that might not have afforded them the same opportunity and that&#8217;s a real shame.  JF: Your mother must have had to work hard. My mom was a single mom and that was in the [19]80s. What did she do?  GR: She was a secretary at an insurance company and she that. My mother remarried when I was ten and my brother was thirteen. We remember that because I was the best woman in the wedding and he was the man of honor; I was the maid of honor. So he was the best man and I was the maid of honor. She&#8217;d met him at church. So it was all as the script would have it that that happens and he became equally supportive and encouraging to us. She was an incredible woman and lived to be ninety-four. I&#8217;ll tell you a funny story about her later on when we talk about the Hall of Fame. But she was very, again, expectations were very high and I think that&#8217;s the key because so many people, no one expected them to do things and so therefore, they ended up not doing all that they could, I think.   I&#8217;ll shut that door.  JF: Sure. Thank you. What church did you belong to?  GR: Broadway Baptist. I grew up there and still am a good Baptist. That was part of the, you&#8217;d go Sunday morning, Sunday night, and Wednesday night. We used to laugh and say Thursday night is book study and Tuesday night is visitation and so our whole family, a lot related around that as we grew up.   JF: You said you feel blessed that you had high expectations from your family and encouragement. Did you feel that you were unique among your peers for that?  GR: I guess I really never thought about it. One of the stories is when my brother and I were both very, very young, he did something or I did something wrong surely and he hit me and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that. You&#8217;ll upset Mother.&#8221; It was like we kind of monitored each other while she was still a single mother. So we kind of monitored each other in that respect. I remember when I was a teenager, I went to a local furniture store and said I wanted to buy a washing machine and a dryer for my mother and I told them I had planned how I would pay for it, that I had these jobs and that I could pay this much a month. And I think the store was so taken back that some child basically had come in and wanted to do this that they allowed me to do it. But that was all just what&#8217;s unusual about that? If you want to do that, you go do that. Now some people may call that gutsy, but at that time, it was just a matter of if you want something, you have to work hard to get it and that&#8217;s what we did.  JF: So it sounds like hard work, obstacles were just kind of part of daily life. So the obstacle of being a woman and wanting to do things that usually men just do didn&#8217;t seem that different from all the other obstacles.  GR: No, it really didn&#8217;t. My first job I was six years old.   JF: What did you do?  GR: I worked at a swimming pool and I worked there all the way through my junior high years and started out sweeping the floors. I got paid a quarter a day, but I got to swim free. So I thought I&#8217;d made it and hit a home run there. And then you work you way into, after cleaning, you then get to work in the basket room or then in the little soda thing and cook hamburgers. Then the ultimate, you got to lifeguard, but then the very ultimate thing was to be able to work in the box office and that was my goal, was to one day be able to work in the box office and sell tickets because that was a lot of responsibility with money. And I think that&#8217;s where the business sense, I always had a leaning toward business and sports. That took me all the way through junior high school working there. But I have a picture in my office of that swimming pool on opening day in 1927, not that I was there, but that swimming pool opened in 1927 and it&#8217;s just a reminder to me that you work hard and with good fortune and support, you can achieve a lot of things. So I take great pride in having worked at the swimming pool. That was my first job.   JF: Wow, six years old.  GR: Yeah. But Mom was working and we didn&#8217;t have a dad. So if we wanted anything, if I was going to pay back those people for the washing machine, I had to work.  JF: So did you end up getting the washing machine and dryer for your mom?  GR: I did.  JF: She must have wept.  GR: She was proud and I think that was a lot of it. We wanted to make her proud. We felt like she had had a hard life. Our natural father died when I was two and Danny was five and that was her second husband. Her first husband had died after six months. This one died when they had young children. So it was like she&#8217;s had a rough life and she&#8217;s kept the faith. She&#8217;s strong. She&#8217;s positive. She&#8217;s encouraging. So we didn&#8217;t want to upset her or disappoint her and so that was a lot of the drive. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s healthy, that&#8217;s the healthiest way to do it, but it was certainly an influence on us, both of us, growing up.  JF: And you said college was expected?  GR: Oh yeah.   JR: Were you worried about how college was going to get paid for?  GR: Well, by that time, Mother had remarried and I went to a school, East Tennessee State, which was about an hour and a half away from home and tuition was very, very low. He was working and she was. So they had enough money to pay for my tuition. I then got a job and helped pay for the food and anything extra that I wanted other than tuition. Like [if] I joined a sorority. That had to come out of my money. So they sacrificed. I didn&#8217;t realize that until I was older. I&#8217;m not sure they loved peanut butter as much as they said they did, but they sure did eat a lot of it. They did without a lot and I think that&#8217;s the unconditional love that you felt. They never held it above your head and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re giving up a lot for you&#8221; or &#8220;We&#8217;re doing without so that you can have.&#8221; But you just knew that. You saw that. It was never held over your head. It was like, &#8220;They are doing so much. I need to repay.&#8221; That&#8217;s a good premise on which to grow up, I think.  JF: What did you go to school to study and what were your expectations for what would happen after college?  GR: Well, again, now there were certain things that women could do and certain things you couldn&#8217;t. So I fit the mold. I would be a teacher. I would be a teacher and a coach, which allowed me to take advantage of my athletic abilities. But I also enjoyed the business side of it. So when I taught in college and whatever, I also had camps in the summer and ran tournaments that made money. So I enjoyed the entrepreneur side of it and so that&#8217;s where I was kind of drawn to. But growing up, going to college, it was I majored in education. Now my masters degree I did get in administration because again, I wanted to see the inner workings of budgeting and prioritizing and those types of things. So the two together made a good background for going into athletic administration, coaching for a while and then being an AD [Athletic Director] and then doing what I do now. So it was a good segue.   JF: You got your MA at UT [University of Tennessee]?  GR: Uh huh.  JF: At UT-Knoxville. Did you straight from undergrad to there?  GR: No, I went to Orlando, Florida, to teach and I taught there for three or four years, three years, I guess, absolutely loved it, lived in Orlando. The average age teacher at our school was twenty-seven. Most of us were single. So we were still in college trying to teach these young children something and so I had a good time doing it and I loved it. Like I said, teaching was the best job I ever had. But I realized I needed to continue my growth and so I came back and got my masters degree and then went on to teach in college for a couple of years. And again, I saw that I was drawn to the business side and so from there in Mississippi, I applied at UT for the athletic director&#8217;s job, their first one, and the rest is history, as they say.  JF: Yeah. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for. It would have been, what, [19]70, [19]71 when you finished your undergrad?  GR: Undergraduate in [19]69.  JF: [19]69.  GR: I did it four years. Now [19]65 to [19]69, that&#8217;s pretty good. And then I went away to Orlando for a while and then came back and got my masters. I can&#8217;t remember what year that was. Then I went to Mississippi for a couple years. I came back here, I think, in [19]77, as the women&#8217;s athletic director. That was the result of Title IX, I think, in terms of the university, because when I was here in graduate school, I coached their tennis team, but they were all club sport teams. So you had women&#8217;s opportunities, but they were not funded with scholarships nor travel money or coaches&#8217; salaries, certainly. I got a graduate assistantship to coach tennis. So that&#8217;s how I got my masters. I coached while I did that. So that was the basis and they had probably ten or eleven club sports for woman at that time, but all the instructors taught either in the physical education department or in other departments and did that on the side pretty much.  JF: So the motivation to coach a women&#8217;s club sport must have been purely interest and support, not monetary.  GR: Yeah, it wasn&#8217;t monetary. It was interesting. When I announced that I was leaving UT to go to&#8212;well, one, I&#8217;d finished by degree and I was ready to move on. I was only there a year, I guess. I got my masters in a year. So they said, &#8220;Well, why are you leaving to go to Mississippi?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, the school that has hired me gives full scholarships in women&#8217;s tennis.&#8221; So that was like the next step. At that time, UT did not give any of this. The school in Mississippi was a private school for women. It was Mississippi University for Women. It used to be called Mississippi State College for Women. They offered full scholarships in tennis and basketball and volleyball. I thought, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m going to coach, I&#8217;d like to coach people that I can go out and get scholarships and better players.&#8221;   So I went and did that for two years and then the university decided that, &#8220;You know what? We probably need to take this serious too.&#8221; They called me and said, &#8220;Would you be interested in applying?&#8221; I applied and we started from there with a change in attitude and certainly, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll ask me about Title IX, it certainly had an influence, but I would never say that it was the driver. I don&#8217;t think that it was. I think it was probably caught their attention that probably they were woefully lacking in what they were doing for women, but there were no lawsuits, there were no threats, there was none of that. Again, in the South, that would probably hurt you as much as it would have helped you to have done that. So strategically, coming in as the first women&#8217;s athletic director and starting a women&#8217;s program, I think it was helpful that I was familiar with the dynamics and the politics and the gender issues that I could use that to my advantage. I think if I had come in cold and not known, it would have probably been harder to get started. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s good or bad, but it&#8217;s worked out okay. I think the Lady Vols have proven to be a pretty successful program. So that was the interesting part.  JF: How would you describe the kind of strategies that were successful in the early and mid-[19]70s?  GR: Well, a lot of it was parents and a lot of it was subtle. What do you call it? Passive aggressive, maybe we were that. I made bumper stickers that said this and handed them out wherever we traveled and all over town and it said, &#8220;The Lady Vols Too.&#8221; It was &#8220;Lady Vols...Too.&#8221; Our message was, it&#8217;s not in place of the men, but in addition to the men, there&#8217;s now Lady Volunteers. Tennessee being such a big football school, the fear was, is this women&#8217;s athletics going to hurt football?   We had to immediately make everybody feel comfortable. It&#8217;s not going to hurt football. And when I could say, &#8220;When I lived in Florida, I flew home every game, every weekend for the football game.&#8221; &#8220;Oh so you&#8217;re one of us.&#8221; I went, &#8220;Yeah. And when I was in high school, I was one of the hostesses that hosted the recruits they brought on campus.&#8221; &#8220;Oh so you understand.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I understand. I know who Mallon Faircloth--.&#8221; &#8220;You know who Mallon Faircloth is?&#8221; I said, &#8220;He was the last single-wing tailback at UT.&#8221; So immediately, it drove down the fear and what we were dealing with was the fear of the unknown. So we were trying to gently lay it out and we did that through campaigns of &#8220;Lady Vols...Too.&#8221;   And we had to spout out. If I&#8217;d go to speak to a Big Orange Club, I&#8217;d talk about football, basketball, men&#8217;s sports, for five or ten minutes first before I got into women&#8217;s sports so that they felt comfortable. And when I&#8217;d come in, they&#8217;d say, &#8220;Boy, you don&#8217;t look at all like we thought you&#8217;d look like.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re short and you&#8217;re little and you&#8217;re petite.&#8221; I said, &#8220;So what was I supposed to be, a linebacker?&#8221; So this fear of what it was going to be, we had to reduce that a lot.  The second thing was what we asked for in terms of funding. Again, we did not take a sheet of paper and say, &#8220;Title IX says you must give us the same thing that the men get.&#8221; And quite honestly, I got in trouble with some women&#8217;s groups here for a couple of reasons. The first one is, we&#8217;ll talk about it in a minute, but the second one was, as an example, in basketball, the men&#8217;s basketball team, the players got ten pairs of shoes. Now keep in mind, the women&#8217;s basketball team had been a club sport. They had never gotten any shoes. So I budgeted and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to need three pairs of shoes.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Well, if the men get ten, don&#8217;t we need ten?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need ten. I only need three, okay. Do they need ten? That&#8217;s up for them to decide, okay, but we need three. Now four years from now, we may need four because how you practice is different and what floor you&#8217;re practicing on and all this kind of stuff.&#8221; But so we were never really turned down, we asked for what we needed to succeed, not what the men had. I didn&#8217;t think that was a good standard [to ask for what the men had] and again, I think that was well-received in the South and so that worked for us.  One of the things that we did, the first things, was we didn&#8217;t have a name and my fear was if we don&#8217;t give ourselves a name, someone else will. And if the headline said in the newspaper, &#8220;Tennessee beats Alabama,&#8221; they&#8217;re going to think the men beat Alabama, but it might have been us, but they didn&#8217;t know that. So we came up with the name &#8220;Lady Vols,&#8221; or I did, and I thought it was a nice touch. Graphically, it was a good brand. We could sell it, whatever. And again, a lot of the women&#8217;s groups got mad because they said, &#8220;Well, they don&#8217;t call the men Vols the &#8216;Gentlemen Vols.&#8217; Why are you calling it the &#8216;Lady Vols?&#8217;&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s really for identity purposes. It&#8217;s not stating any other social or any type of issue there. It&#8217;s really for recognition.&#8221; Because at the same time, the newspaper was doing a contest of what to call the women&#8217;s teams. You need to write these down. Some of these were the &#8220;Volettes,&#8221; the &#8220;Orange Maids,&#8221; and my favorite was &#8220;Vols Dolls.&#8221;  JF: Vols Dolls.   GR: So I&#8217;m convinced had we not named ourselves, they would have named them for us. They&#8217;re not going to put, &#8220;Tennessee women&#8217;s basketball beat Alabama&#8217;s women&#8217;s basketball team.&#8221; They&#8217;re just not going to do it.  JF: It&#8217;s going to be a pretty big header.  GR: Yeah. You had to do that and plus, from a branding standpoint, it proved to be very marketable and it was not offensive, except for a few groups and hopefully, they got over it.   JF: Do you remember which groups were most vocal?  GR: Yeah. There was one liberal group of women out in Holston Hills and they called me. They were more political in nature. It was not the women&#8217;s studies groups, even though speaking of that, Sharon Lord would probably be someone good for you to speak to. I don&#8217;t know if anybody&#8217;s given you her name or not. Dr. Sharon Lord, very impressive, started the women&#8217;s studies program at UT. She&#8217;d be good. But I think once they heard the explanation, there wasn&#8217;t that much resistance. So we didn&#8217;t have any protests, but there was still the sensitivity that you had to have.  JF: It sounds like the groups that were not on board with the Lady Vols were thinking of sort of political rhetoric.  GR: Yes.  JF: And you were thinking more in terms of pragmatic business.  GR: Right.  JF: What&#8217;s going to be marketable, consumable.  GR: Right. And I didn&#8217;t think it would hurt the women&#8217;s movement if we called the Lady Vols. I think they did. They thought that it would be accepting a position of second class and I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;Why is being a Lady Vol second-class? I don&#8217;t get that.&#8221; But we survived. We did fine.  JF: You sure did. I was going to ask you one question about sort of what was going on in Knoxville in terms of the women&#8217;s movement at the time and if there were allies or connections between the community and the university.  GR: Early on, some of the hardest people to get to support you were the women, which I always found interesting. They weren&#8217;t comfortable talking sports as much then as they are today. I could get [more] support from the Kiwanis and the Rotary Club than I could from the women&#8217;s clubs. They didn&#8217;t have any interest in what I had to say. So it was really, sometimes women are the worst to support women in terms of what they&#8217;re making in payroll or compensation. They&#8217;re moving up the ladder. They seem to take shots at women more than they did men, which I always found interesting. That&#8217;s changed, but early on, that was there.   JF: Would you have called yourself a feminist in the [19]70s?  GR: No, I wouldn&#8217;t have because I never thought of it as an issue and the ones that I witnessed, that&#8217;s all they thought of as an issue. They were anti-men and I never got that. I was pro-woman, but not anti-men and at that time, it seemed as though those that were the most active in the women&#8217;s movement were anti-men. They were mad at men for this. They were angry at them for this. They blamed them for that. And I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;You know, maybe we can blame ourselves here. If we don&#8217;t expect ourselves to do much, we won&#8217;t. And if we run into the first hurdle of an obstinate old guy who won&#8217;t cooperate, then you&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to make him do what you want him to do.&#8221; So I never understood why we stopped and would batter him. Why don&#8217;t we figure out a way to turn him? So it was a different approach.   So I never felt that and I don&#8217;t know that I was ever called a feminist. I don&#8217;t think that I was. And it may have been at that time, that word did not carry a real high perception by people. So maybe I didn&#8217;t want to be called that. Maybe my actions and my behavior and my results would tend to make one think that, but I don&#8217;t recall ever [calling myself a feminist]. Being called a pioneer, yes, a role model, yes, but there was so much anger at that time in the feminist movement. Not similar, but somewhat in the racial thing, I look at that, the problems there. I get real frustrated when we go to seminars and stuff about race relations and we spend more time saying all the things that the white folks have done wrong rather than, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about all the things that we can do to help the blacks.&#8221; You have to get the right frame of mind. I think you encourage these people. You don&#8217;t tear down these people. So it was kind of a similar course right there. So I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s about as philosophical as I will be.   Title IX was a good thing. I think it got everybody&#8217;s attention. It got us started. I remember appearing before the Board of Trustees at the University of Tennessee and the president at that time made a statement of the women&#8217;s athletic department had increased a thousand percent, more than any department on campus. And I didn&#8217;t think about who I was talking to. I was just, that made me so mad. I said, &#8220;Well, look, you can have your thousand percent. I&#8217;ll take three hundred percent of what the men got any day.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Okay, that probably wasn&#8217;t a good thing.&#8221;   We did make a lot of strides, but we earned them and that was probably, I think, the better thing for it. If we had twelve scholarships to give, we didn&#8217;t give twelve the first year. There weren&#8217;t twelve young ladies that were ready for it. We had them to give if we could find them, but we weren&#8217;t just going to give twelve. Pat still doesn&#8217;t give twelve scholarships a year. She can give fifteen now. She doesn&#8217;t give all fifteen because you have to manage your teams. Don&#8217;t make us do things because the men do it. Let us do what we need to do to be successful. That was the way.  JF: Did you have to negotiate for the money to pull it from something else or were you raising money or encouraging--?  GR: We were raising some. Student activities fees were a part of our budget. The man gave us a certain amount of money and then we raised a certain amount. It was real funny. We could put any amount of money in training and first aid: &#8220;Oh you&#8217;ve got to take care of the kids.&#8221; So we&#8217;d put it in there and then use it somewhere else. But they were pretty good. My key thing was there&#8217;s three things to spend money on and the order of, the first one is you have to hire the right people and you&#8217;ve got to pay them. When I came, they said, &#8220;Well, we thought all the coaches could be one-tenth time.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Absolutely not. All the coaches will be full-time. We don&#8217;t need twelve scholarships. We&#8217;ll only, say, give five, but we&#8217;re going to have a full-time coach.&#8221; It&#8217;s coaches and then athletes and then your schedule. That&#8217;s where you put all your money and in that order. It made our decision-making much easier in that if it didn&#8217;t hit one of those three, then we didn&#8217;t spend it. We didn&#8217;t need to.  JF: Did you have models in other universities that were helping you in planning for the Lady Vols or were you sort of going on your past experiences at Mississippi and Florida?  GR: Probably a little bit of both. Keep in mind, at that time, there was AIAW [Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women], which was not the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] as most people know today. It was a women&#8217;s organization, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, and they governed national competition between women&#8217;s teams and they had rules that were different than NCAA rules. The big division in AIAW and the big split always centered around scholarships. The AIAW did not want to give scholarships for women. They thought that would be the downfall for women.  JF: What was the rationale behind that?  GR: That women should be participating in sports for the purity of the game and that if we once introduced scholarships and money into the game, we would become as bad and as illegal and cheating as the men&#8217;s teams. I&#8217;m going, &#8220;What?&#8221; You had a real divide and some schools had more money who could give scholarships and others think, &#8220;Well, as long as y&#8217;all can&#8217;t give them, I can compete with you.&#8221; So philosophically, though, there was a big difference.   I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;d own up to it now, but Donna Lopiano, who was head of the Women&#8217;s Sports Foundation for years, she was at the University of Texas before that as athletic director, she and I went head to head on the convention floor in that she was totally against scholarships and I was totally for scholarships. You got UCLA is this way and somebody is this way. So everybody was kind of fighting it out. Will it be the death of women&#8217;s athletics?   A lot of people thought if we gave scholarships that we would ruin the sport itself and this was primarily coming from women that had grown up in the National Association for Girls and Women in Sport, NAGWS. They were scholars and academicians and purists of the sport, that you played for the love of the sport, and not that that&#8217;s bad, but if you&#8217;re going to compete, we felt like we needed to give scholarships, sell tickets. When I came, they said, &#8220;The team plays at two o&#8217;clock in the old gym.&#8221; And I went, &#8220;Why?&#8221; &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just what we do.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, then nobody can come see us if we&#8217;re playing at two in the afternoon.&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right.&#8221; I said, &#8220;We need to change that.&#8221;   It was just a whole different set of different young mindsets coming into the arena. And Donna Lopiano, who went on to go to Texas and gave scholarships like crazy, started out very much of a purist. She was from New York. She was one of those eastern ladies I was telling you about.   JF: Would it be fair to say that the women who were saying that scholarships would be the death of women&#8217;s athletics were of an older generation?  GR: Yes.   JF: And did they come from wealthy or upper class or from--?  GR: No, they did not. They came from, I would say, an academician background. They were not elitist in that regard, but they were very smart and they were very well-intentioned. They truly felt like it would ruin women&#8217;s sports. It was not a shallow argument for them at all. It was from their heart and that was why it was such a passionate argument because those of us on the other side felt just as strongly. We didn&#8217;t think that we were turning our girls into prostitutes to sell tickets to see them play and they might wear skimpy shorts, but you know, it was just a difference in approach. And now I see some of those ladies and they&#8217;re at the games and they&#8217;re yelling and they&#8217;re just as happy as could be. But from their soul, their core, they felt like it would hurt the sport which they loved.   So once they got past that and of course, once they went into NCAA, that all changed anyway. The purists would probably tell you if we hadn&#8217;t given scholarships, we&#8217;d have never been merged into the NCAA. We could have been stand alone. Fine, but you don&#8217;t have any money to pay for the teams to travel to the national competitions. You don&#8217;t have the television money. You don&#8217;t have all these things that come with the merger of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s sports. But you would have protected the purity of the sport had we never had NCAA get involved and therefore, we should have never given scholarships. That was our downfall. So it&#8217;s just an interesting--.   And they fought battles that I never had to fight. God love them. And it may have been they didn&#8217;t know how to work the people that were their obstacles. You don&#8217;t just go head to head with them. They try and figure out a way to get them to nudge a little bit so you can turn them just a touch. They were just, it was this way or not.   JF: I might be off base, let me know. Was there like a concern coming from these women of the older generation that women&#8217;s athletics, their respectability would be tarnished by having competitions?  GR: No, they were competitive as hell. Competition was not a problem for them, but you did it not to please a crowd or to be written up in the newspaper. You did it for the purity of the competition itself and it should be enough. You shouldn&#8217;t have to have somebody pay you to go to school or have to pay to come watch you play, or they didn&#8217;t have to come watch you play. You should be giving your one hundred percent effort at two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon with no one there to see you. And that&#8217;s good, that&#8217;s true, but as things were changing, do we want to leave the women out of the telecommunications world that&#8217;s got radio and then television and now satellite and now internet? They would have still been playing at two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon had their wish come true. It couldn&#8217;t happen.  JF: And you said that a lot of the women in this older generation came from the East or the North?  GR: Yeah. You got a lot there, either that or they were more vocal, they were in leadership positions, a lot more schools. Where was it? She was in New York somewhere, Donna. Where was she? There&#8217;s a bunch of schools up in New York. Anyway, it just seemed different and the ones that were from the South were all, again, very educated, very much, but again, if they want to play you in badminton, they&#8217;d beat you to death. They&#8217;d have no mercy, none. They&#8217;d beat you to death, but they did it for the love of the sport.   They felt like we were losing the value of the competition, that by exploiting the sport, we were exploiting the young women that played and they found that very distasteful, as do I. The word &#8220;exploitation&#8221; is bad. We wanted to think we would not exploit women like some of the men have been exploited. Have we? We probably have in some cases, yeah. But was that worth not giving women the chance to learn how to be on a team and how to lose and win and how to be embarrassed? How do you win gracefully in front of thirty thousand people or how do you lose gracefully in front of thirty thousand people?   So those were the lessons that our young girls weren&#8217;t learning that the boys were and when you got in the workplace, the women were at a big disadvantage because they didn&#8217;t know how to be on a team, how to play a role. If in fact the only women&#8217;s sport [that] was okay to play is tennis, that&#8217;s pretty much by yourself, swimming is pretty much by yourself. So it was like individual sports were okay and so the women were not learning the team sport benefits that needed to be learned to survive in today&#8217;s business world and really in society.  JF: Yeah. I was thinking of that when you said young women learning to win and lose gracefully in front of people and how that would translate into the classroom, the boardroom, the courtroom, wherever.  GR: Yeah, and it&#8217;s how, do you play a role? If you&#8217;re on a team, you have a role. You may be the star. You may not be the star. You may be the star one game, but not the next game. You may be the tall one that gets the rebounds or the short one that dribbles the ball down, but everybody has respect from each other as to what talents they bring. Well, here you had women that just knew how to play tennis against somebody. They didn&#8217;t know how to work together. There was no team camaraderie. There was no learning of those roles and that was critical.  JF: Let me pause for just a second. We&#8217;ll skip to the next track.   (break in conversation)
JF: Okay, the sound is still good. So it&#8217;s 1977 and you&#8217;re asked to come back to Knoxville from Mississippi to be the first women&#8217;s athletic director. I&#8217;m going to ask some mundane questions. They may seem silly, but--. We talked a little bit about the name. So Lady Vols was your idea and you wanted to make sure you named or the team got named by the women.
GR: Yes.
JF: What about uniforms? What kinds of debates or issues were around uniforms?
GR: Didn&#8217;t really have a debate there. We had to learn to get on it from a business standpoint that we got on a cycle of rotating new uniforms. It used to that the women would wear uniforms until they were worn out. Well, let&#8217;s figure out the cycle for wearing out. Can you wear your warm-up suit longer than your--? So we got into a formula for doing things like you would in a business. So you didn&#8217;t just do it. You weren&#8217;t the Raggedy Anns. You wanted to look good and all that.   The first day I came to the office, or I came to work, I said, &#8220;Where&#8217;s my office?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have one.&#8221; I went, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Where&#8217;s my desk?&#8221; &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have one of those either.&#8221; There was no typewriter. There was no secretary. I mean, it was nothing.
JF: Wow.
GR: We were able to really start from scratch and identify. We had temporary offices until we moved. Nobody ever thought to maybe put us in Stokely Athletic Center. I said, &#8220;Well, wouldn&#8217;t that make sense?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not where you play basketball.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; So a lot of it was so there wasn&#8217;t resistance. It had never been asked before. So I felt very blessed in that there really wasn&#8217;t a whole lot of resistance. It then became a matter of us making decisions early on with our coaches. I got the coaches lined up and we sat down: &#8220;Okay. What&#8217;s the most important thing? Athletes and then schedule.&#8221; You&#8217;ve got to have if you have the coaches. We had great coaches, just super coaches. We got some good athletes, not all scholarship, but most of them scholarship, and a few years later they were all scholarship.   So it was really birthing it from nothing and I think that&#8217;s part of the entrepreneur in me is enjoying building that. What&#8217;s your marketing plan? What&#8217;s your budgeting formulas? What&#8217;s your personnel decisions? What&#8217;s your public speaking, your persona? I did a lot of speaking. Three times a week, I was on the road traveling to different groups just to talk to them to alleviate any of the fears. The biggest thing, I think, was the fear would we hurt UT football? Once we got past that, we were okay.   We learned a lesson in that when we sold our first season tickets to women&#8217;s basketball, I thought I was smarter than everybody else, so I know who was going to buying these tickets and so we did a campaign directed at this particular demographic. I thought it would be college-educated couples with young children would be who would come to our games. That makes sense. They were educated. They were near this age. They understood what was happening and it was a good role model for these young girls, their children. Well, that was not who came to our games and I never bothered to look to see who came. I just [thought I] knew who came or who would buy season tickets. As it turns out, the biggest purchaser of season tickets were retired couples that had a certain level of discretionary income and they could afford to buy season tickets. They could afford to travel with the teams and our young athletes became like their grandchildren. They just made over them and brought them the booster club forum to make the girls feel at home and they brought them food and cookies. It was not the college-educated couple with two young children. So it was interesting, the seniors, and if you go to basketball games today, still the majority of the public will be retired senior citizens. It&#8217;s amazing.  JF: That really just belies the idea that an older generation is going to be conservative and against women athletes.  GR: They don&#8217;t go to the men&#8217;s that much, but they go to the women&#8217;s games. It&#8217;s their little girls. They like little Susie. And the other measure of success is when early on, you&#8217;d say something about the Lady Vols and they&#8217;d say, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t care.&#8221; You knew you had arrived when at Sunday school, they&#8217;d not only know the Lady Vols played the night before, but they&#8217;re mad about either the official at the game or they think Pat&#8217;s not substituting well. And I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Well, we have really arrived that they now are involved. They&#8217;ve bought into it. They&#8217;re a part of it.&#8221; And you can&#8217;t make people do it. You have to make it available for people to do that and that was maybe our approach was we made it available and it took. I&#8217;m not sure forcing it, force feeding, don&#8217;t think would have worked.   JF: I was going to ask about local press coverage. I guess you might have answered this that you couldn&#8217;t have forced it or created something that didn&#8217;t exist and sold it to people. But what was the local press coverage like? Did you have allies?  GR: It was pretty good. We allowed access probably more than the men did at that time. So they were able to get to know. We had to get through the reference to the tall blonde or the blonde with long legs. I&#8217;m going, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; Not that they wrote that, but that was how they thought of different ones whereas the men, they didn&#8217;t do that. They said, &#8220;He&#8217;s got a good jump shot&#8221; or &#8220;he screens well.&#8221; And they identified him by his talents, okay. Women have arrived now. They are identified by their talents. They are identified by the purity of their jump shot, their vertical leap, their ability to do certain things with a ball. That didn&#8217;t come automatic. You had to make their talents available.   And that&#8217;s why when I first came, we had more team sports than what we ended up with because I cut sports. I cut gymnastics because we didn&#8217;t have a feeder system in the state of Tennessee and nobody in this area, the only gymnastics was the rich kids at a private club. So I said, &#8220;Okay. That&#8217;s not going to be a sport.&#8221; And I did away with field hockey much to the chagrin of a lot of the women that had been involved in sports because that was a huge sport for women years ago. It again was not played in the state high schools. There was not teams and summer leagues of field hockey. So we limited it because our thing was unless it is legitimately an intercollegiate sport, we&#8217;re not going to call it a part of the program.  We were very careful to try and maintain credibility and so we treated our athletes that way and tried the media with the athletes. We would talk about them in terms of their vertical leap, those types of things, their hang time, because they had never viewed women in that way in sports. It was the girl that had the pageboy that could really run fast. They just looked at it differently. So that came along. They did okay.   The biggest objection was, and he's gone on to be famous now, was Paul Finebaum. He now has his own radio show in Alabama in Tuscaloosa or Auburn. He&#8217;s a big Alabama boy now. He was the editor of the Daily Beacon at the time, the sports editor, and we couldn&#8217;t get the campus paper to come to our games. We had two local papers then, a morning and an afternoon. We could get them to come. We could get local communities to come. We couldn&#8217;t get our own UT paper, the Daily Beacon, to come. He just wrote an editorial one time that when women&#8217;s sports were good enough to come watch, until that time, he would not be going to any of the games and wasting his time. So he admitted and of course, I challenged him, that he had never been to a game. So he was making a decision not to do something based on no knowledge whatsoever and it got ugly. He became no longer the sports editor of the paper. But there was that of he being in the position of power that he would decide who was worthy of coverage and who was not, and he decided that the women at this point in time were not worthy. Not that they wouldn&#8217;t be in the future, but right now they were not worthy. And I really didn&#8217;t think that was his choice if he had never seen it.   So Tennessee was one of the first ones to have men practice teams. So that kind of raised the credibility a little bit. &#8220;Oh.&#8221; They realized that they&#8217;d do a pickup with some of the Lady Vols and they&#8217;d get beat because they were pretty physical. So you had all that going on. But the media coverage was pretty good.  JF: Do you think the fact that in the [19]70s there was nationwide a lot of attention paid to women who were breaking barriers or breaking into male-dominated arenas, do you think that helped in eastern Tennessee or not?  GR: A little bit, but now keep in mind who were your women stars at that time? They were Billie Jean King, individual sport, Chrissy Evert, individual sport, swimmer, individual sport, you really didn&#8217;t have the team sport person. There were not that elevated an athlete at that point. The role models that young girls had growing up, because they wanted to be like Magic Johnson, it was a guy basketball player because there weren&#8217;t any females for them to have. Now little girls want to grow up and be Candace Parker or they want to be Diana Taurasi or Chamique Holdsclaw. They want to be Maya Moore. And they now want to be in their same gender. So that&#8217;s changed a little bit&#8212;I mean, changed a lot&#8212;that you now have recognized athletes. When the soccer team won, several years ago when they won, that was huge for team sports for women, huge. It got more coverage than the women&#8217;s basketball team winning the gold medal.   So people still decide which sports, but you&#8217;ve seen the parents come along now and the men, the daddies, are just as obnoxious about their daughters, their opportunities, and them playing. They didn&#8217;t use to. If they had a young girl who was, quote, pretty good in sports, she was probably a tomboy and they kind of downplayed that, whereas now, they&#8217;re telling you, &#8220;My kid can pitch this softball at this level&#8221; and &#8220;she shot jump shots and she shot twenty out of twenty-five.&#8221; They&#8217;re talking now about the abilities of their young girls in a different way than they did before. They&#8217;re coaching their young girls&#8217; teams.   And again probably going back to the AIAW, it&#8217;s just been the ruin of all athletics is when we started giving those scholarships because now we&#8217;re competing. So that was it.  JF: So do you think that sort of just the pragmatic, kind of business sense changes? Getting the money, getting the funding for full-time coaches, or changing when the games were played, those had a bigger impact on changing the way the community thought about women&#8217;s athletics than legislative changes?  GR: I think the legislative was kind of like your card in your back pocket. You played it if you had to. It wouldn&#8217;t have been played well here, just knowing the dynamics, and it would cause resentment from some. So we did it based on credibility, that we worked hard and we deserve this.   It&#8217;s also changed, talking about the money, scholarships go up as inflation goes up, but what&#8217;s really changed and therefore has changed the expectations are the college coaches&#8217; salaries, particularly in women&#8217;s basketball. Whereas coaches of women&#8217;s teams for years have been protected, if you didn&#8217;t do well, it didn&#8217;t really matter, nobody was going to fire you, well, if they&#8217;re paying you five hundred thousand or more a year, they then begin to matter and they&#8217;ll fire you if you don&#8217;t do well. Again, if we&#8217;d never given scholarships, we&#8217;d never reach this point in time. I see that happening now. You used to see a team that had the same coach for years and she never won, and you also had more women coaching women. Now you&#8217;ve got men and women coaching women&#8217;s teams. I don&#8217;t know what the percentage is. That would be something to look up. I don&#8217;t know what that would be.   But Pat&#8217;s making over a million dollars a year and a young lady just joined at LSU [Louisiana State University], second head job, she&#8217;s going to be making seven hundred thousand a year. She&#8217;d better win. If she&#8217;s been given the money, she&#8217;d better win. That&#8217;s the way the business is. So that&#8217;s different. That&#8217;s not love of sports. That&#8217;s you&#8217;ve got to win to keep your job and most of them embrace it. Others do not and they stay in a school or in a system that allows them to really work with the development of a less talented athlete and not really pay much attention to the wins and losses at the end of the year.   In terms of Title IX, I do want to say one thing. I probably was different than most people and I still am probably different, I know I am with Pat and Joan and all of them here, is that using Title IX language, do you interpret that to mean that if you include football in the men&#8217;s sports numbers, you&#8217;re talking about eighty-five to a hundred young men on the football team. So are you saying that because you have eighty-five people on the men&#8217;s football teams, you&#8217;ve got to have eighty-five people on women&#8217;s teams? Which women&#8217;s sports are you going to do? So it&#8217;s almost like you create more sports for women than maybe is credible. To me, if they&#8217;re not--. You&#8217;ve got softball-baseball, basketball-basketball, tennis-tennis, volleyball-volleyball. You&#8217;ve got track-track, cross country-cross county. Then you&#8217;ve got this football and some of the women will argue, &#8220;We still should have all the money that they get for those sports for women&#8217;s scholarships.&#8221; What are you going to give them in? So don&#8217;t create--. You could say, &#8220;Well, gymnastics.&#8221; Or you could say, and a lot of schools are going with rowing because it&#8217;s a large number of people. Gymnastics is expensive and it&#8217;s a small number of kids, the team size. So there&#8217;s those decisions being made, but I think including football, to me, is not necessary to be in compliance with Title IX. Every other women&#8217;s athletic director would probably argue with me on that one, but I wanted to be a pioneer.  JF: So as the athletic director in the [19]70s, what kinds of concerns and problems were women coaches and student athletes bringing to your attention?  GR: I don&#8217;t know what problems. It was how to we best present the product and making the athlete realize the role that they must play both in going to classes, being a good citizen on campus, and then not minding beating somebody&#8217;s butt on the court, but not to be a bully off the court, that they were just like everyone else and that was important.   We didn&#8217;t have problems with drugs, didn&#8217;t really have problems with pregnancies. We talked about it. We did have some issues with eating disorders that we had to address that I think maybe the men didn&#8217;t have to address. And that&#8217;s maybe a sweeping generalization, but we had an awful lot of young girls, particularly in our track and cross country programs, that thought weight was an issue and they did not eat well. So that was a little bit of a problem.   I guess my concern is that they not let it go to their heads, that they not become prima donnas because then I kept hearing those little old ladies saying, &#8220;If we give scholarships, it&#8217;s going to be the ruin of women athletes.&#8221; So I didn&#8217;t want them to become spoiled, privileged, prima donnas, and quite frankly, they had the opportunity to have that role model than some of the male athletes. So have we been able to as a group say that we&#8217;ve been able to maintain that in the women&#8217;s sports? No, because now we do have prima donnas, but we fought it pretty hard and I still think they try, but between the media and the money and everything else that goes with it.  It used to be we&#8217;d have television. I remember the first game we televised. Kids didn&#8217;t even really think about it. They were just there playing. And now you see the kids playing basketball and the TV camera and they&#8217;ll actually go by and show their jersey. Why do you even know where the camera is? Why do you care? But they&#8217;re marketing themselves. That&#8217;s come with it.   And probably those women would say that giving those scholarships just ruined those girls. You can see things that trouble you and you can go back and say, &#8220;Maybe they had a point.&#8221; It probably wouldn&#8217;t have happened, but think of all the good things that wouldn&#8217;t have happened too. So if we can minimize the bad that can happen and try and celebrate the good, then I think it was worth the risk. That kind of is my take.  JF: Did you have student athletes or did you hear about this from their coaches in the [19]70s, sort of in the early years of the Lady Vols, did you have them dealing with getting harassed or dismissed by fellow students or by male student athletes?  GR: No, I think we had the issue of the fear of lesbianism amongst the ranks of women&#8217;s sports. Was that an issue? I say it wasn&#8217;t any different than society. It certainly wasn&#8217;t grown. It wasn&#8217;t an organic growth with the department or anything like that. So I think some of them were sensitive to that and some of the adult supporters wanted to feel good about that, whatever that would make them feel good. We had a little bit of that. But then you got that tall blonde with the long legs that counters that. So the media didn&#8217;t jump all over that. I often wondered if some of our athletes early on because some of them were quite masculine in their behavior, not that they were or were not lesbians, but a shot putter, she&#8217;s going to have a different gait. Well, this shot putter, she went on to win an Olympic gold medal. So she was a pretty good athlete and so she looked pretty strong. She was pretty strong. So they had to get used to seeing, particularly when we got to the level of the elite athletes, that these were pretty well-trained and well-oiled machines. They trained hard and they played hard and they performed well. So Pat has a thing to say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t take donkeys to the Kentucky Derby.&#8221; We had some show horses and we had a lot of attention on that, but I don&#8217;t think early on.   I think we worked real hard on the appreciating it and I want to believe that it paid off, that those girls appreciated. I&#8217;m concerned now that the girls, today&#8217;s athletes don&#8217;t appreciate what those young women went through, but I don&#8217;t think they felt like prima donnas. At least, we tried not to.
We didn&#8217;t have dorms for women. The men had dorms for men. We didn&#8217;t want to. Now does that mean Title IX, we should have demanded to have our own dorm for women? We didn&#8217;t want a dorm for women.
JF: You mean that they would just be in the regular student population?
GR: Yeah. We just mainstreamed them and I thought that was healthy. I thought it was a disservice to the men to all live together. But some women&#8217;s advocates would have said, &#8220;But if the men have a private dorm, the women should have one.&#8221; Well, but we don&#8217;t want one. So much of it in that transition time is trying to understand what was the spirit and the intent, not the legalese of Title IX. To me, it was the opportunity for the women to perform at their highest level and to do that, they needed coaching, they needed scholarships, and they needed travel. It didn&#8217;t say that they had to have ten pairs of shoes. We didn&#8217;t need. What would we have done with them?
JF: What do you think is the biggest difference between the treatment of women student athletes at UT in the early years of the Lady Vols versus now by the university, sort of the administrative higher-ups?
GR: Well, I think they are now a more marketable asset. I think the university takes great pride in the achievements of the women&#8217;s teams and because of the increase in publicity and national exposure, the university is benefitting from the Lady Vols doing well in basketball. They&#8217;re going to be on TV a lot. The Lady Vols in softball right now are doing very, very well. They&#8217;re going to make it here. The track team. You go all the way down the line and it&#8217;s a way to broaden the base of people that care about the university because you&#8217;ve opened up a whole new realm. It&#8217;s different than who I thought it was, but it&#8217;s a whole new group of people that support women&#8217;s athletics and therefore, support the university. And they get a lot more television coverage. As much trouble as our men&#8217;s basketball coach got into with the NCAA and ultimately lost his job this year, you had Pat Summitt, who was the winningest coach in men&#8217;s or women&#8217;s basketball. So you had that balance. If you didn&#8217;t have that, you just had bad, bad, bad about Tennessee. So you have the opportunity now to use the women&#8217;s achievements to balance that. They&#8217;ve been, I think, the community has been interested to get to meet some of these young ladies and be very impressed with them.
JF: But were you the athletic director when the Lady Vols won their first national championship?
GR: When the Lady Vols won their first national championship, but it was in track. It wasn&#8217;t in basketball.
JF: Oh okay. What year was that?
GR: [19]81. I think it was [19]81. My thing, we had all the teams in the top five and ten of them were in the top ten and five of them were in the top five, and we won a national championship and that&#8217;s when I decided, &#8220;That&#8217;s a good time to leave. You&#8217;re looking really good.&#8221; Because I wanted to get more in the business and the entrepreneur, the marketing, which is what I do now is market events all the time. There&#8217;s sports and there&#8217;s non-sports. So my skill set was better served as an entrepreneur starting things than it was in maintaining and increasing. It&#8217;s important to know your role. I&#8217;m a starter. I can get you pumped up, fired up. You&#8217;ll give me money and I&#8217;ll get you started and we&#8217;ll do great. I&#8217;ll stay with you about three or four years and then I want to just do something else. The athletic director that&#8217;s there now has done a great job of maintaining the excellence and even furthering what their accomplishments are, and that&#8217;s a talent I didn&#8217;t have. I didn&#8217;t have a passion for it. You have to have a passion, I think. Okay.
JF: So did you leave in [19]81-82 then?
GR: You know, I was thinking about this driving over. I think it was [19]84. I think that&#8217;s when it was. I think it was.
JF: What did you go on to do?
GR: Marketing. I started out doing a PGA golf tournament, started it, ran it for about four years, and now I&#8217;ve turned it over and somebody else is doing it. So I just like to do that. And with the Sports Corporation, that was what it started and then they asked us to take over the convention bureau so that we could use our business strategies for getting conventions the same way we were sporting events, and it&#8217;s worked. So we&#8217;ve been very blessed that we&#8217;ve had growth in all those. But it&#8217;s like every event, you come up with a new name, a new logo, a new budget, a new marketing plan, and it&#8217;s great and then they go away and then you start. We&#8217;ll have a hundred and eighty events in one year and they&#8217;re all brand-new. The next year, they&#8217;re all new again. So isn&#8217;t that fun? It&#8217;s fun to me. Okay, we&#8217;re getting close.
JF: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about the Hall of Fame? I know you said you had a story about your mom you wanted to share and maybe, I know you were inducted.
GR: I was. I think they felt sorry for me. But anyway, the Hall of Fame, a group of women thought there needed to be a hall of fame to recognize the achievements of women in women&#8217;s basketball. So they formed a committee of about thirty, thirty-five people that represented all parts of the country and they tried for about two or three years to raise the money to build the building to get it started and whatever. They were never successful.   So I stepped in and I said, &#8220;You know what?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Let us give it a shot here in Knoxville. Number one, it makes sense because of the highway systems. You&#8217;ve got I-75 and I-40. You&#8217;ve got basketball that&#8217;s very well-received here, women&#8217;s basketball. We&#8217;ve got national credibility for sponsorship opportunities.&#8221; With their vote to let us do that, we took off and we went out and raised ten million dollars and built the building, signed a contract with their board that we would build and develop and manage the Hall of Fame for them, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. That&#8217;s a part of our umbrella, this overall organization. So we&#8217;ve been in business.   The thing of it is, which I think is kind of neat, it&#8217;s: &#8220;Honor the past. Celebrate the present. Promote the future of women&#8217;s basketball,&#8221; which it&#8217;s the only hall of fame that recognizes women&#8217;s achievements anywhere in the world that&#8217;s a building. There&#8217;s lots of halls of fame, but a building that recognizes it. It&#8217;s really pretty special if you go through it. At first, I was just zeroed in on the bricks and mortar. It&#8217;s a building. It&#8217;s pretty and it&#8217;s beautiful and it&#8217;s got great exhibits. And you find out later that what it really is, [it] is a building of stories and then the people that come through, they have memories and they tell you their memories. It&#8217;s really kind of special.   I went in last year and I was the reluctant inductee. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go in on behalf of all the managers and the trainers and the booster clubs&#8221; because I wasn&#8217;t a great basketball coach or a great basketball player. But I love the sport and so I&#8217;ll represent all those that if it weren&#8217;t for those people, there wouldn&#8217;t be this. The AIAU coaches in the summer, they&#8217;re never going to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, or a trainer who wraps your ankle or the manager who washes your clothes. But without all those people, you wouldn&#8217;t have the stars of today. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll accept on their behalf.&#8221; So it was a nice honor and I felt very humbled by it.  The board still chooses the inductees. We put on the induction ceremony. It&#8217;s June eleventh, I think, this year and it&#8217;s a very nice affair. You&#8217;ve got the symphony orchestra and it&#8217;s very nice, very nice.  JF: What was the story of your mom that you were going to share?  GR: Oh if you go by the building, there&#8217;s this huge basketball on the one end of the building. My mother passed away when she was ninety-four. She lived for a long time. And probably when she was ninety-two, she was kind of in failing health and so Sundays, you&#8217;d go to church and then you&#8217;d go out to eat with your parents. That&#8217;s just part of it. Well, she was pretty much not able to do that a lot. So this day that we put the ball on the building, it had kind of rained. So I decided not to take her and I thought, &#8220;Well, that Sunday afterwards, I&#8217;ll take her over there and show her the ball and she&#8217;ll be proud.&#8221; She got to be there for the first induction. She was still living then. I took her over there and I showed her the ball. We got out of the car and walked down there. I said, &#8220;See that ball, Mom?&#8221; And she said, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s twenty feet wide. It weights thirty thousand tons. And it&#8217;s got ninety-six thousand little nubs on it to make it look like a basketball.&#8221; And she looked at me and she said, &#8220;Well, who'd be stupid enough to count?&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Okay, then. So much for impressing her.&#8221; So expectations were a lot with her.   And the whole community kind of enjoyed building the building. It&#8217;s a source of pride, I think. So it&#8217;s good.  JF: So what would you say is your proudest accomplishment or your biggest accomplishment so far in your life?  GR: You know, I don&#8217;t know. Probably seeing some of the young ladies that came through the program or were interns here at this office, the Sports Corporation office, probably seeing how they&#8217;ve developed and taken advantage of some of the opportunities that they&#8217;ve had, that they didn&#8217;t just say, &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; They&#8217;ve pretty much--. Somebody said, &#8220;Well, who&#8217;s your idol&#8221; or &#8220;who&#8217;s your role model&#8221; or whatever, and mine&#8217;s so different than anybody else. Mine&#8217;s not Condoleezza Rice. It&#8217;s not somebody like that. Everybody is going to say their mom and that&#8217;s true, but mine are the single moms that have kids, that are having to work two jobs, and they never complain. You know what I mean? They put clothes on those kids&#8217; backs. They take them to softball and soccer and they go take them to school and they&#8217;re active in the PTA, and they&#8217;re working two jobs and they never complain.   Now to me, that shows more power and focus and energy than, you know, if somebody looks at somebody like me or Pat and says, &#8220;You&#8217;re a role model.&#8221; We&#8217;ve got it made. Our obstacles are gone. So I don&#8217;t idolize someone who&#8217;s already got it made. I really idolize those that are fighting like hell to live and they are doing it well and their kids are normal and happy and resourceful and not whiney and not spoiled. That&#8217;s just amazing to me. That&#8217;s who my role models are. I don&#8217;t even know their names, but I just see them at the grocery store with three little kids hanging on them. I know they&#8217;ve had a rough life. I&#8217;ve got an easy life compared to that. So okay, that&#8217;s the end.  JF: I think that&#8217;s a great way to end.  GR: Okay.
