 IVANNA GONZALEZ:  All right.  So my name is Ivanna Gonzalez, and this is Joey Fink, and we are here with Kim Bobo doing an interview for the Southern Oral History Program&#8217;s Long Women&#8217;s Movement project, and today is September 28th , and it is, it&#8217;s nine-fifty-seven.  So thank you so much for allowing us to interview you today.  We&#8217;re both really excited.    KIM BOBO:  My pleasure.  IG:  I think we&#8217;ll just start off with a really vague question and you can take that where you wish.  Can you tell us a little bit about your, about where you come from?  KB:  Sure.  So I grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Cincinnati is on the Kentucky border.  So on some level it technically north, but really kind of a southern city.  And about half the people in Cincinnati moved there when mines or railroads closed down in eastern Kentucky.  It was the first sort of northern city where there were manufacturing jobs and whatever.  And so that&#8217;s really part of my history in that my mom&#8217;s family, she was born and initially brought up in eastern Kentucky, Irving is what they called it Irvin&#8217;.  And when the mines and railroads closed where they were, they moved to Cincinnati to try and find jobs.  And they brought with them this very southern church called the Church of Christ, which is what I was raised in.  It&#8217;s the non-instrumental churches.    IG:  What does that mean?  KB:  That means they don&#8217;t believe you should have organs or instruments in service that you should just sing with your voice.  Now historians say it&#8217;s part, it&#8217;s kind of class-oriented in that the rich churches in the cities could afford organs and actually became, there was a big split in 1906 and actually became the Disciples of Christ.  Where the poorer more rural churches, the Churches of Christ couldn&#8217;t afford organs and so this whole theology developed around you shouldn&#8217;t have organs.  Now again I&#8217;m not trying to argue the theological point, but I grew up in this church that really comes out of in many ways kind of the rural, poor South called the Church of Christ.    And so the church I grew up in and this is like the Baptists here in North Carolina, we went to church Sunday morning, Sunday night and Wednesday night, every week of the year.  So it was a pretty, it was a really significant part of your life.  And the church was, that I grew up in, was almost everybody was from eastern Kentucky because they had moved to Cincinnati to get jobs.  Every, almost everybody was working class.  Most people worked in the factories that&#8217;s why they went to Cincinnati.  Then often in the summer people went down home, and down home meant you went to eastern Kentucky.  So again the church stuff is very kind of southern tied.  Now for those of you, if you look at the Church of Christ now.  It&#8217;s not longer a poor rural church.  I mean there are some big mega very rich churches in Nashville and Dallas and whatever.  So it&#8217;s not really that, it&#8217;s on a lot of levels like the southern Baptists in that you used to have lots of really small, poor churches that now there&#8217;s these mega kind of churches.  So again it&#8217;s gone through some transformation.    My dad is a product of World War Two, went to college on the GI Bill.  He would, came from a really poor family in Fort Worth, Texas.  And his dad died leaving three sons when he was thirteen.  He had a twin brother and a slightly older brother.  I want to tell you a little bit about my dad, and it will make sense how it has affected me.  So my grandma on my dad&#8217;s side had a sixth grade education.  So when her husband died, she took in clothing and sewing and whatever, and my dad did paper routes and whatever.  My dad had a very serious speech impediment and stuttered, and so in the family and particularly with the twins they always talked about my dad being the dumb one.  And but he actually was pretty good in math stuff and engineering and whatever.  But he was the dumb one.  So World War Two comes along, and he and his brothers enlist in the Army, and this is in the early years of the build up before World War Two before folks were sent overseas.    And at that point they were testing everybody because we had this math and science gap in the country.  So they were trying to identify particularly men who had science abilities.  And he apparently tested off the charts in math and physics stuff.  So they put him in college.  He was absolutely convinced he was going to flunk out, that he wasn&#8217;t smart; he was the dumb one.  And he couldn&#8217;t possibly, somehow the test was wrong.  So he gets to college up in Minnesota.  He&#8217;s never been out of Texas.  They drop him in college in Minnesota, and besides being freezing he could do it.  He was pretty good in math and ended up doing, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m doing pretty well.  Okay, this is okay.    So then he as the war effort heated up, they pulled all these guys out of college and dumped them all in the infantry.  And it was a special program.  Anyway they dumped them all in the infantry.  He wanted to be part of the war effort, but he didn&#8217;t really want to carry a gun.  So anyway, they said well, you can be a litter bearer.  So he said okay fine I&#8217;ll be a litter bearer.  He&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t take much training to do that.  So they send him to France.  The first big skirmish the medic is killed.  His commander hands him a manual and says you&#8217;re now a medic.  He said, he had no clue.  So he&#8217;s reading the manual.    So he served out the war, survives the war, comes back, finishes college, becomes an engineer, moves, got in early on in the jet engine division when jet engines were first starting.  Got on with General Electric, moved to Cincinnati, which is one of their jet engine divisions.  Meets my mom at the Church of Christ because he grew up in the Church of Christ as well.  Got married, have the kids.    But my dad, my parents had two kids, my sister and me.  And it might have been different if my dad had had boys.  But my dad didn&#8217;t have boys; he had girls.  And realized that he had daughters who were actually pretty good in math and science.  And so it was incredibly encouraging of us and because he always thought he was dumb and it took him years to realize he wasn&#8217;t dumb, he was very intentional as a parent of trying to say you&#8217;ve got to work hard but you can do a lot of things.  He was an encouragement of my sister and me in terms of doing what we needed to do, not that we were brilliant but that we weren&#8217;t dumb.  And that we needed and could do things, and that really came out of his own experience.    So we had this church experience that it&#8217;s in the fundamentalist tradition.  So it&#8217;s very conservative in lots of ways, no drinking, and there were people who didn&#8217;t dance.  My grandmother didn&#8217;t play spot cards.  There&#8217;s all this kind of stuff.  On the other hand it was warm and loving and caring about people.  Folks said oh how was it coming up in a fundamental--?  It wasn&#8217;t, it was a lovely tradition.  So I have no sense of it being a harsh tradition.  It wasn&#8217;t harsh.  It was caring for one another and spending lots of time with people and, and I memorized lots of Bible verses.  It&#8217;s a very biblically oriented tradition, and I might have been a little bit competitive.  So I always won the Bible verse contests.  [laughing]    IG:  I have no doubt.  KB:  So I have a lot of tiny little pink Bibles to prove it.  You got the little pink Bible if you won the Bible verse contest.  But again so it was a central part of who I am.  And you did all that, but you also sang hymns.  You sang hymns and singing because we didn&#8217;t have organ, singing was a central part of the tradition.  And so I learned to sing; I learned to read music; I learned to read shape notes.  I mean, just this whole singing tradition was part of it.  And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re singers or musicians, but music gets in your spirit and the words of songs, so on the one hand you&#8217;re memorizing the Bible verses, but the words of the songs are in your spirit and I think influence who you are as a person.  So again that whole tradition was significant to me.    In addition to that my parents, again they weren&#8217;t social justice folks.  They weren&#8217;t advocates per se.  But they cared about people.  So we spent enormous amount of time visiting sick people, visiting shut ins, visiting the elderly.  And when people came up from Cincinnati [Kentucky] looking for work and they got to Cincinnati and ran out of money, the first place they would call would be the church, and my dad would say, &#8220;Kimberly, come on.  We&#8217;re going down to the bus station.&#8221;  We&#8217;d go down to the bus station, pick up families, trying to figure out where they could go and how we could help them and either get them settled in Cincinnati or give them money to get on up to Detroit where there were even more jobs.  It was part of this people went from eastern Kentucky to Cincinnati to Detroit, part of the whole jobs migration.  But again the caring for people was just absolutely central to who I was.    So when I go through my high school years and whatever, and most of the people in my church didn&#8217;t go to college.  But if you did go to college, you went to the Church of Christ college, and the nearest Church of Christ college was Nashville, Tennessee.  So I didn&#8217;t even apply anywhere else.  I just applied to go to David Lipscomb College in Nashville, Tennessee.  So I arrived there, and whoa, it was wild because it had the, it was Church of Christ, but it was no longer the loving kind.  It was so restrictive.  I'd gone to public school in Cincinnati, Madeira, actually a suburb, Madeira High School.  And I was there, graduated in[19]72.  So I&#8217;m there during the Kent State killings.  I&#8217;m there during [19]68 stuff.  I mean so my high school was  a little wild, and we&#8217;d fought all these, some of the fights, which you look back and think that was silly, but it was a huge fight at the time.  In my high school a huge fight was for the girls to be able to wear pants to school.  You know again&#8212;  IG:  Did you win?  KB:  Of course we won.  [laughing]  Are you kidding me?  Of course we won.  Or for me in high school when I went to high school, it was required that all girls take two years of home ec.  So the girls had to take two years of home ec, and the guys had to take either shop or mechanical drawing.  That was the division.  And I hated sewing.  I just hated it.  And I really, I could cook fine.  Why do I need anyway--.  And the idea of taking two years of home ec was just horrible to me.  So I decided I wanted to take mechanical drawing.  I&#8217;m good in math; I&#8217;m good in--.  And so the high school said I couldn&#8217;t do it.  So then I fought; I had a fight at the high school level that we had to take to the school board to allow me to take mechanical drawing for two years.  So I was the first girl at my high school to ever take mechanical drawing.  But again there were these you look back on it and you think that was, kind of a silly fight.  But it was those little fights at all the little high, at the local high schools for girls to be able to wear pants to school or for the girls to be able to take mechanical drawing, things that people can&#8217;t even imagine right now.  But so there were clearly some fights in my high school.  So I get to this college, and at the opening invocation or of the college the president of the college stands up and says, &#8220;Well, you know I know many of you girls are here to get your Mrs. degree.&#8221;    IG:  What&#8217;s that?  Oh.    JF :  They still say that.  KB:  It&#8217;s like whoa, I mean, from the top person in the college doing this to the welcoming freshmen.  It was just like whoa that&#8217;s crazy.  And then the David Lipscomb had these rules that girls had to wear dresses or skirts, to all classes to chapel that you had every day, to all meals and all day on Sunday.    IG:  So when couldn&#8217;t you, when didn&#8217;t you have to?  KB:  Saturday when you weren&#8217;t eating.  [laughing]  And then if you wore pants, the limited time when you could wear pants you had to wear wrist length tunic tops over your pants.  I&#8217;m not sure because you would show you had a waist or--.  It was like what was that.  And then there were these rules where first year students, freshman women had to be in the dorms by seven p.m. but the guys didn&#8217;t have to be in until ten.  What&#8217;s that about?  Anyway, so I had been like really, I had fought a few little things in high school, but I was basically this really good kid in high school.  I organized prayer groups at the school.  I was really a good kid.  But getting to college where they just had these completely stupid rules, it just brought out every rebellious bone in my body.  And so I would climb out of my dorm window at night, not that I was going to do anything.  I didn&#8217;t do anything bad.  But it just, I shouldn&#8217;t have to be in the dorm at seven p.m. if the guys don&#8217;t have to be in the dorm.  So I ran through the men&#8217;s dormitory all the way down every floor just for the fun of it.  Anyway, did a few things, anyway that ended up getting me like dormed, like punished.  And I, actually the last ten days, anyway so the last ten days of my time at David Lipscomb the first year, I was spent dormed.  I wasn&#8217;t allowed out except for meals and classes and church.    IG:  My gosh.  KB:  Anyway, so I decided David Lipscomb wasn&#8217;t the place for me.  But again I did well in school.  I think I made straight As in my first year there, and it was all fine.  Then I&#8212;  IG:  Can I ask you a quick question?   KB:  Sure.  IG:  Were you satisfied with the teaching at David Lipscomb College, like the classes, the curriculum?  KB:  I started out as a double math and music major, and the math classes were fine.  It&#8217;s hard to do anything too weird to math and calculus.  The music was fabulous, was absolutely fabulous music because these were all singers.  So the singing was,  I've sung my whole life.  The singing at David Lipscomb was the best singing I've ever done.   And I still have singer friends from those time periods.  But the Bible classes, which you had to take a Bible class every day, not the best.  But the other stuff was fine.  It was really fine, but it was really the rules around behavior that were so discriminatory against women and out of touch with where the rest of the world was.  It was like again I'd grown up in the Church of Christ, but this was like a complete throwback to the like another era.  Pants and can&#8217;t wear pants on Sunday and really?    So I dropped out and I, but I stayed in Nashville, and I ended up getting, I just I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do at that point, but my parents were like look, if you&#8217;re not in school, you&#8217;re on your own dear.  We love you, but you&#8217;ve got to find a job, whatever.  So I tried to take a test.  Anywhere I could take a test I thought I&#8217;ll do okay because I can test pretty good.  So I took some tests and got into the actuarial department of an insurance company because I did so well in math stuff.  So at this insurance company, where they, any place they could let you take a test, I took a test.  So&#8212;  IG:  That&#8217;s a good strategy.  KB:  And so there I did really well on the math parts.  So they said put her in the actuarial department.  Oh my lord if you ever wanted to go back to school, work in the actuarial department of an insurance company.  JOEY FINK:  What is that?  What do you do?  KB:  It&#8217;s like the numbers part where they figure out the death rates and what the numbers ought to be and what the rate should be based on, oh my word, the most boring stuff in the entire world.  And I was eighteen years old in this job, and so I learned, I would do hours of just adding on a calculator.  So I to this day I can do numbers on the phone because they&#8217;re like the calculator.  But it was so boring.  But at the same time a colleague, somebody I knew had gone in, done the same test stuff not done as well on it but got put into the management track because he was a guy and going to have to provide for a family.  And I was just as single girl, which again was like, so he was actually on a much more interesting track than I was.  It was again, you look back and you think oh that&#8217;s interesting.  I didn&#8217;t, at the time I didn&#8217;t, it was just oh okay.  But it&#8217;s really not right.    So I started trying to think about okay what did I want to do and where did I want to go and working with the actuarial department really wasn&#8217;t my idea for the life.  And I decided, I worked for a couple summers at a church camp.  So some of the liberals at David Lipscomb had organized a, they&#8217;d done some it&#8217;s almost kind of like missionary stuff where they sort of set up camp in some really poor communities in Bed-Stuy in New York.  Anyway there&#8217;s a long history on that.  But anyway they ran a camp in New Jersey for poor kids.  And I mean so anyway I became a camp counselor at this place, and the kids were almost all African American kids, and you had to, there was this long sort of racial training awareness program that you had to go through to be a camp counselor, whatever.  I used to say look, I&#8217;m not sure we did any help for the kids, but the kids did a lot of help for the counselors.  So you just kind of, I had some racial awareness stuff, but that was really quite an eye opener and really a great experience and ended up going in and visiting New York and loved it.    And the story that you briefly heard about me meeting George Reid on the train was when I was in college and stayed friends with one of these girls from Bed-Stuy and took the train from New York to Cincinnati and had this girl with me who was clearly another race, another class.  We just didn&#8217;t make sense together if people looked at us.  And George Reid the Council of Churches director here saw us across the aisle, and when the girl went to the bathroom, he leaned over and said, &#8220;How are you two together?&#8221; which started a thirty-seven year friendship with George Reid from last night.  But anyway, so I decided I loved New York and I applied to both NYU and to Barnard in New York City.  Got more money from Barnard; so I said fine I&#8217;ll go to Barnard.    So I move, I went from David Lipscomb in Nashville, Tennessee to Barnhard, which is a women&#8217;s college, part of Columbia University about as far as you could go in terms of types of schools and backgrounds.  And it was really great.  It was a great place.  Although so I moved to New York.  I get there, and I didn&#8217;t know a soul in New York City but got there.  And it was very clear, very quickly that people were better educated than I was.  I mean a lot, two-thirds of the kids had gone to private high schools.  Just again I knew I was reasonably bright, but I'd never written a paper.  I did not write one paper in high school, and my first year in college I was a math and music major.  I didn&#8217;t write papers.  So I get to Barnard.  I&#8217;ve decided I was going to be a religion major.  I take five classes and every class requires a paper.  I didn&#8217;t know how to use the library.  I mean I&#8217;m like oh my word.  [laughing]  But once again, on some level the family training was work hard and you can figure it out.  Work hard and you can figure it out.  And so on some level I eventually learned to write.    But it wasn&#8217;t easy, but Barnard was so great.  It was so supportive of women and women doing anything, and yet you were in a big university.  So you could take all sorts of classes and I could take classes at Union Seminary.  So I took a class with Gustavo Gutierrez the sort of liberation theologian, and my parents had gotten calls from friends of theirs, pastors and other folks in the Church of Christ telling them they shouldn&#8217;t let me go to Barnard because I would lose my faith if I did so.  And my parents ignored it and kind of let me, let me do whatever.  [background noise&#8212;microphone] But I really feel like the, my sense was, look if I can&#8217;t maintain my faith by moving to a different city what kind of faith is that.  Like it&#8217;s not really worth that much if you can&#8217;t keep your--.  Now clearly my faith changed and on some level my views about spirituality and religious practice broadened and deepened and I learned about other religions.  So on some level maybe some of the Church of Christ folks were right in terms of I lost my faith as they knew it.  But it was a wonderful, wonderful place.    I mean there&#8217;s lot of experiences from college, but probably most important one was I was doing kind of organizing on hunger work on campus and I had put together an anti-hunger group, and then I'd help do some anti-hunger groups and some other campuses and put together a network of anti-hunger groups around the Northeast.  So I was kind of doing organizing kind of stuff.  And there was this woman named Marie Runyon who was a long time organizer.  She had like, she was a white woman but had been a main fundraiser for the Black Panthers.  She had done tons of tenant organizing.  Actually originally from North Carolina, an interesting connection.    IG:  Oh a southerner.  KB:  A good, another good southern root.  And anyway she, eventually became a state rep, but she was older at the time she was state rep, maybe sixty or something.  And I remember hearing that one of her first speeches at the New York State legislature, she basically stood up on the floor and said this place is really terrible.  Somebody needs to throw a bomb in this place.  Anyway they referred to her from then on as Grandma Bomb thrower.  But quite a character.  But she was going up and back to Albany all the time and she needed, she had two dogs, lived by herself in Manhattan, had two dogs and needed a dog walker.  And so she put out the word that she wanted a student who was active in social stuff, social action, to walk her dog in exchange for free rent.  So New York City, free rent, that&#8217;s a good deal.  So I interviewed with her.  She asked me to come be the, her dog walker.    And she was really my first organizing mentor.  First time I was arrested was with her.  She was such, just classy, a good southern classy woman.  She always dressed nice.  She was always lovely, and then just did the wildest things.  Always active in her church, and again good southern lady in lots of ways but a real organizer.  And so I'd go with her to tenant meetings and whatever.  And at one point she got this call about these immigrants who were being illegally evicted.  There was this whole issue in New York where they were trying to evict people whether or not it was the right thing--even if they&#8217;d been paying their rent--to get people out so they could turn the apartments into higher rent apartments.  It was a whole effort going on at the time.    So she gets this call about an illegal eviction and says, &#8220;Kim, I&#8217;m going down.  Want to come with me?&#8221;  I&#8217;m like, sure, why not.  So we jump in a cab, get down to the place, get out, and we&#8217;ve got basically movers and a moving truck moving all their stuff out.  And she says to me, &#8220;Kim, stand in front of the truck and look big.&#8221;  She goes, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go deal up in the apartment.&#8221;  I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How do I do that?&#8221;  She says, &#8220;Put your hands on your hips and spread your legs and stand.&#8221;  Okay.  So I look big in front of the truck and she goes up and is trying to stop the stuff up in the apartment.  Eventually they called the police on us.  The police came, hauled us away.  They take us up to the police precinct in Manhattan up in Harlem near where we were, and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;What are you guys doing here?  What happened?  Who do you work for?&#8221;  Anyway, so Marie who was in the state legislature says, &#8220;I work for the governor.&#8221;  But anyway they were not happy with us and so they said, &#8220;Well, we need to do a strip search and we don&#8217;t have any female officers here.  So we&#8217;re going to take you to the downtown lockup.&#8221;  And so they put us in the back of a police car, and Marie says to me, &#8220;You know this is the first time I've had this happen.  I don&#8217;t think this is going to be good.&#8221;  [laughing]  IG:  Oh dear.  KB:  So they take us downtown and sure enough did a complete strip search looking for violent weapons on the two of us.    IG:  Oh my gosh.  KB:  But we eventually got out and it was all fine.  But she really was the first time I met anybody who had like done social justice work for their life.  And I always, I always wanted to help people and had kind of thought well, maybe I could do social work, because I was good in music, maybe I could be a music therapist.  Or trying to figure out how you do something that would help people.  But she really gave me this sense of there&#8217;s organizers and people, and there&#8217;s work out there and you can figure out how to do it.  And you just really have to be driven by your passions, and anyway, it was just like this whole vision.  And she was such an awesome role model.  Now the truth is she just turned ninety-five&#8212;  IG:  Wow.  KB:  this past year.  And about a year ago she and some other women went down to the military sign up and offered themselves to go to war instead of the young men and women and got herself on the front page of the New York Times.  I don&#8217;t know front page but on the New York Times, Grandmas for Peace is what they were called.  But yet again here she is having trouble walking, can barely see, has trouble hearing, but she&#8217;s still going down doing actions.  That&#8217;s what I want to be.  I want to at ninety-five be doing some sort of action.  So again you start looking back so I had this family that was incredibly encouraging and a dad who was encouraging, and they always say for women in leadership a lot of them have dads that were encouraging.  The moms are encouraging too, but the role of the dad is important in women feeling able to function in a world with a lot of men.  But then Marie such a role model, such a role model for me.  So all right, so now we got kind of through the college years.  IG:  Do you&#8212;do you&#8212;  KB:  Do you want me to stop?  IG:  Do you have any questions you want to jump back to?  JF:  Yeah, I&#8217;m really curious.  What were you thinking when you were sitting in that cop car?  KB:  I just, I really didn&#8217;t even know.  I didn&#8217;t know what to thin.  She said this is not going to be good.  I&#8217;m like okay, well--.    JF:  Was Marie like this brand new kind of force of nature or was there something about her you recognized from women in your childhood or women in your community?  Had you seen a woman like Marie before in your life?  KB:  No, I don&#8217;t think I'd ever known anybody quite like Marie where they were really so out front on social justice stuff.  But I had known lots of people like her in terms of being self-assured, being dressed well, being active in the church, being--.  The church for all its flaws and for all the craziness around the role of women in leadership in the church, you look at women who have come, who go into leadership, a huge number of people have come through the church because it develops leadership skills.  When I was thirteen, I was teaching Sunday school classes.  You develop, now in my tradition you couldn&#8217;t, you could only, as a girl you could only teach young kids.  You couldn&#8217;t teach the older, again, but again so many women develop leadership skills in the church.  And I think that&#8217;s particularly too if you look at the history of the black church.  Black women&#8217;s leadership almost always nurtured and came up through the church.  So yeah, I saw lots of strong women.    IG:  So you have all these great stories about these times when you sort of fought back in high school and you kept saying, I didn&#8217;t, I felt, you felt that there was something wrong but you said you hadn&#8217;t quite figured it all out yet.  When did that happen for you?  When was that click moment when you said oh that, that was somebody saying I couldn&#8217;t do something because I was a female?  KB:  I don&#8217;t know.  It&#8217;s like some of the stuff goes back even really, I went, when I was in sixth grade, I went to a church camp, and at the church camp they, they had morning devotions and Bible classes all morning, and then in the afternoon we&#8217;d swim and have fun whatever.  The morning was all Bible stuff.  So  I had this teacher for the girls because of course the boys would be in one place and the girls would be another who said to us that to be a good Christian wife and mother, which was clearly our ultimate goal, you need to learn to embroider your own pillow cases.  I remember thinking, that&#8217;s the dumbest thing I ever heard.  Are you kidding me?  I&#8217;m not embroidering any pillowcases.  And my mother who was a lovely, lovely woman, she didn&#8217;t sew.  There&#8217;s now way we&#8217;re going to have embroidered pillow cases at my, it was just, so there were just these things that people said that were so dumb that you had to go really, come on.  So again I feel like really a lot of the stuff in terms of women could do or not do came out of that sense of that is so dumb, really.    IG:  Like in the reality it&#8217;s just so obvious it doesn&#8217;t match up with what you&#8217;re saying it should be or you&#8217;re expecting.  KB:  Right or that I need to wear pants all day on Sunday, really.  And where&#8217;s that in the Bible.  Maybe it was that I also knew my Bible very well.  That I knew the things that people pull out and make into these really important things are really not the central core teachings of our biblical tradition.  I mean the tradition was around love and justice and poverty and caring for people and healing people.  I mean that&#8217;s what the tradition is.  It doesn&#8217;t say anything about embroidering pillowcases or not wearing pants on Sunday.  It&#8217;s just, we bring all of our craziness in the society to our faith.  And trying to sort out what&#8217;s the craziness and what&#8217;s really the core truth I think is one of the joys of life is trying to figure that stuff out.  I think on some level my family encouraged that kind of thinking.    And it&#8217;s so funny because my mother, she stayed in the Church of Christ her whole life.  I think by the time she decided a lot of the stuff in terms of not allowing women in leadership by the time she decided how wrong that was she&#8217;d just been there so many years she didn&#8217;t want to change.  But they would, at the point when she was seventy-five, she&#8217;s going to the Church of Christ.  At that point she&#8217;d moved hear my sister in Virginia.  They&#8217;d send out these little notices about what would you like to volunteer to do.  And she would always volunteer I will read, I will read, I will read the Bible passages in service.  I'd be happy to teach the adult class, all things women were not allowed to do.  At seventy-five she&#8217;s pressing the pastor around I can do all these things.  And she could, she could.  And at her funeral my sister and I lead music, which women were not allowed to do, and we had women leading the Bible verses all in a Church of Christ church.  So we used her funeral to just kind of push her little agenda.  But again so you&#8217;re, so on some level my mom fought back in her own ways.  My dad was encouraging and again maybe if he&#8217;d had guys he wouldn&#8217;t be supportive of women, but he wrote all these papers about the role of women in the church and got hate mail as a result of it.  So they were supportive of kind of doing stuff.  IG:  How did people react to you when you were taking the lead on wanting to take this technical drawing class?  You said that we went to the school board but you were the one who ended up taking the class.   KB:  Right and no one else took the class initially.  Of course they changed the whole policy.  People were like go, yeah, do.  I never wanted to take that class either.  So again people were supportive.  I often find in any of the social change stuff that a lot of people will support you.  A lot of people kind of wish they could do it but for whatever reason don&#8217;t have the kind of chutzpah, the kind of self-confidence.  I do think an awful lot of the ability for us to move forward is just the sense of feeling okay about yourself and that you can step out of what&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not smartness.  It&#8217;s really more self-confidence.  And not self-confidence that you think you&#8217;re the smartest or the best or whatever.  It&#8217;s not inflated kind of stuff.  But it&#8217;s a confidence in just your own who you are as a person.  And I think that, that on some level either gets nurtured through your family or gets nurtured through your experiences and your friends to develop that.  But you got to have that to be much of a leader in social change.  IG:  What about your sister?  Does she sort of comes up?  KB:  You know it&#8217;s so interesting because my sister while she hasn&#8217;t done the social justice thing quite in the same way she went into afield that is completely dominated by men and is doing well in it.  She went into railroads.  Know you can imagine railroads and transportation is like all guys.  And she&#8217;s, she now works for the World Bank doing, on their railroad team advising countries on how to deal with transitions and changes in railroads.  So virtually every country she goes into at work, she works primarily in with the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and Turkey and that whole region.  It&#8217;s all men, just all men.  But again I think my father and mother nurtured her sense.  She&#8217;s good in science; she&#8217;s good in math.  She, that she can function in this arena and she&#8217;s done well in it.  IG:  What was your, can you remember your first encounter was with feminism as a thing?  I imagine the [19]70s in New York City might have been a time where that came up.  KB:  You would think it would be before then.  But I think the first time I really encountered it was I took a class with Carol Krist called &#8220;Beyond God the Father.&#8221;  And she ended up being my advisor at Barnard, and it was this whole feminist theology that, that&#8217;s interesting.  So I did obviously a whole lot of reading in the whole feminist theology world.  And so I think in terms of the feminist world that was probably my first serious encounter with it.  And it was great.  They were wonderful folks.  Elaine Pagels who&#8217;s now at Harvard, and is just, she was chair of the department at, and she would have all these little like open houses at her house where she&#8217;d invite the religion majors to come and--.  And it was interesting because most of the religion majors at Barnard weren&#8217;t practicing people of faith.  Now they may have been people of faith, but they weren&#8217;t practicing.  And they thought I was kind of cute in that I was, and I was very active in social action stuff and people knew it, but they were very supportive of it.  And so Barnard again has just, just this rich tradition of encouraging and supporting and again there was just never a sense that women couldn&#8217;t be authors, couldn&#8217;t be leaders, couldn&#8217;t be, and I think for so many people, so many women coming up, people need to see people.  You see people in leadership; you see people doing things and you have a sense, well, I can do that.  It&#8217;s not longer not--.  Actually you know I have twin sons.  I always thought I would be a great mom for girls so all I got twin sons.  But the funniest thing was, the church that I, that I've attended for the last thirty years has most, the whole time I've been there really has had a female pastor.  And so when my kids were about five or six years old, we went to some other church one time and there was a guy pastor.  My sons turned to me and said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that men could be pastors.&#8221;  [laughing]  It is what you say right.  So anyway&#8212;  JF:  Can I ask one?  IG:  Well, what, I've been asking all the questions.  JF:  You should be.  You should be.  No&#8212;  KB:  Now I need water.  Is this, have you been drinking this?  IG:  I have been.  You can have it.  KB:  Okay, let me go get one.   IG:  I kind of want to know what you did for fun with whatever spare time you had.  You were in your twenties in New York City in the 1970s.    KB:  Uh huh [from distance]   IG:  What was going on?  What did you do for fun?  KB:  Well, I always sang.  So I found the singing group that made the most sense for me to join.  It wasn&#8217;t nearly as good as David Lipscomb because people weren&#8217;t singers really.  So I joined Collegium Musicum so I sang all the way through college.  I also, my first year at Barnard, I did this thing where I said one day a week I&#8217;m going to go see a museum or a something.  And so I probably went forty times to a museum or a walk or a something or another.  So I knew more about sort of the public places than people who had grown up in Manhattan because they just hadn&#8217;t gone to the stuff.  So I did that.  I joined a church nearby and was active in that.  And then I did all this organizing stuff in terms of anti-hunger stuff and it was fun.  It was very fun.  So I had fun.  I always have fun.  Life is, there&#8217;s so much good stuff and New York is so fun.  I could just walk, you can just walk the streets and it&#8217;s fun listening to all the languages and the people and eating all the crazy food, and it&#8217;s so fun.  It&#8217;s a great city.  IG:  I want to go to New York City with you.    KB:  Oh yeah.  It&#8217;s a fun place.    IG:  This is sort of going back to something we talked about before.  But in high school you talked about all these little fights you had, and then you go to college and you sort of were experiencing these sort of very restrictive environment that you hadn&#8217;t really experienced before.  What made the difference that in high school you kind of, you took on these fights but not at David Lipscomb, that you decided I guess to drop out and then eventually go to Barnard, I guess?  KB:  Well, again I fought back in my own little ways.  I would wear pants under a coat and wear it to chapel.  I would, I did sort of the little rebellion and climbed out my window, and so I fought back in my own little ways.  But I think maybe, maybe I had this sense that I wasn&#8217;t going to stay.  Really after the first quarter I was like, this is, this is ridiculous.  I&#8217;m getting out of here.  So I think the difference in high school is you&#8217;re going to be there for four years.  You&#8217;ve got to change it.  I didn&#8217;t have that commitment to be there and to fight.  But again I did fight but just in frankly in not all that effective ways.  I also had no, at that point I had no training in how to think strategically on this stuff.  I just, you just kind of did stuff completely by gut, and guts are good but not over time you learn some ways of thinking about things strategically.  I don&#8217;t know.    IG:  Well, we&#8217;re at about quarter to eleven.  Right at--do you want, we&#8217;ll just wrap up.  Do you mind if I take a few photos while you guys are talking?  KB:  Yeah, sure, sure, sure.    IG:  We like to get the action.    KB:  Okay fine.    JF:  But we, do you (           ).  J:  Is there anything that you would like to say that we haven&#8217;t touched on.  I know that we&#8212;  KB:  Well, let me, maybe what I should do is also just talk about the beginning of getting into the more kind of professional social organizing kind of stuff.   IG:  Yeah.  KB:  Because for me there, I think there&#8217;s some lessons for folks.  So I've been doing all this anti-hunger stuff.  So I really kind of looked around to find what were the organizations that I thought were doing the absolute best work.  And I had joined and been a member of this group called Bread for the World, which is a lobby group on hunger issues.  And I just thought what they did was really terrific and I went to a weekend training session, and I, because it united people, it engaged people of faith on lobbying on hunger issues.  So it worked on both working with the faith community and engaging people in more than soup kitchens.  I mean it was engaged in social change and public policy, and anyway, I thought that was so cool.  It was just like perfect.  And they were headquartered in New York, and so I went and  I met with them and said, &#8220;Do you have any jobs.  I&#8217;ll do absolutely anything you have.  Absolutely any job.  I&#8217;ll work really hard,&#8221; and so they had this little three month project that they hired me to do, and of course I worked really hard, and then they hired me to be an organizer, and then of course I worked really hard.  And I was given ten states in the South to build local chapters in, and I built congressional district organizations in probably eighty congressional districts in the South over the next three-year period.  And then at twenty-six I was asked to be the director of organizing for Bread for the World.  And then I spent the next seven years in really doing that and helping build bread for the World.    But I, I often tell people if you find an organization that you just think is the dream organization, and it&#8217;s where you want to be, go pitch yourself.  Go volunteer.  Go offer to work for half the price.  Go do, don&#8217;t like just apply willy-nilly.  Really think about where, what really you think is like doing the best work and how can you get there because that&#8217;s where you should be because that&#8217;s where your heart&#8217;s going to be, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to excite you.  And anyway and for me it was the perfect organization that really developed my skills, developed my confidence, but I really wanted to be there.  When you really want to be there, you&#8217;re going to do good work.    IG:  That&#8217;s great.  I have one more question that I just thought of that&#8212;did you have any experience with unions?  Did you know what unions were growing up?  Did you see them around you growing up in Cincinnati?  What was that before you entered the&#8212;  KB:  The union world.  IG:  The union world.  JF:  I&#8217;ve got to pick up Michael too.  I forgot.    KB:  Okay.  No one in my immediate, neither my dad nor my mom were in unions.  Most of the people working in the factories in the church I was in growing up were in unions.  But again we didn&#8217;t really talk about it.  I mean but again they were union, and so I didn&#8217;t in any way, there was no separation between people in the church and people in the union.  They were just in the union.  And people worked in the factory, and you made a halfway decent living and health care, and that all came with the union.  I did have, I have an uncle who is really active in the union in Texas, and so I had some distant relative.  But again I didn&#8217;t really know anything about unions.  And didn&#8217;t know how they were structured, nothing.  And when I was at Bread for the World, never once worked with unions, never once when I was at Bread for the World.  We just, it just wasn&#8217;t, we didn&#8217;t work for them at all.    IG:  So I think, that&#8217;s all I have.  Do you have any last&#8212;  JF:  Well, we&#8217;ll end it and I want to do--  KB:  Phase two, phase two.  JF:  Want to do another interview.  KB:  Phase two, okay.  IG:  Thank you so much for this.  KB:  Oh you&#8217;re welcome.  Yeah.  No, again there&#8217;s sort of the next phase is really getting into how I got into all the labor stuff and those connections with labor stuff.  So maybe at some time we&#8217;ll do another one.  How&#8217;s that.  JF:  I hope so.  IG:  Can&#8217;t gloss over all about that.  END OF INTERVIEW  Transcribed by L. Altizer, January 18, 2013
