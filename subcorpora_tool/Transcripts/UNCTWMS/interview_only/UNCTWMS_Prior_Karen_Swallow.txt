Evan Faulkenbury: Today is June 13, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m here in Amherst, Virginia interviewing Dr. Karen Swallow Prior about her life history. So first, thanks for being here.
Karen Swallow Prior: You&#8217;re welcome.
EF: First, I&#8217;d really like to hear about your experience, where you were born and growing up.
KSP: Well, I was born in 1965 in the state of Maine, which is where my mother was born and raised. My father&#8217;s side of the family was originally&#8211;. Those who came over from England ended up in Massachusetts but spent all of their lives living somewhere in the New England area. So, we are New Englanders going way back, although my maternal grandparents are from Nova Scotia and paternal, as I mentioned before, from England. So I spent an idyllic childhood in the state of Maine, not on the ocean, as many people think &#8211; most of Maine is not on the ocean &#8211; but inland, growing up in a rural area.         My maternal grandparents were farmers, subsistence-level farmers. They really only made enough to eat and sell a little bit. My grandfather was a musician, a trombone player, a composer. That&#8217;s what he really wanted to do, and he farmed vegetables and had a few cows to feed his family and was always a little bitter about that. So he was kind of a hard man, but very artistic and quite an artistic genius too, but never was able to do anything more than just travel around and play in big bands and go home to the farm. But I have a lot of wonderful memories of playing on their farm, playing in the hay and wandering through the woods with really tremendous freedom, and the ability to explore and swim and hike and play a lot without adult supervision. It was the kind of childhood I wish that everybody could have today.         My parents and I, we lived in various houses. My father worked in a woolen mill first and then an industrial textile company and moved to the level of middle management. So he got moved around a couple of times through work. We went to Buffalo, New York for a few years in grade school, then back to Maine, and then back to Buffalo again when I was in high school. So that&#8217;s where I ended up graduating from high school and going to college and grad school, in Buffalo, New York. So, that was growing up.
EF: Okay. I read your memoir and got a sense of your childhood. Could you tell me a bit more about the impact of your mother and father and grandparents on you personally as you grew up?
KSP: Right. Well one of the biggest impacts that my childhood and my family had on me growing up was my mother especially cultivated in me a love of books and reading. My mother read to all of us kids &#8211; I had two older brothers &#8211; all the time. Even when we were older she would still go around and read books to us at bedtime. So I developed a strong love of books, and through my mother and my maternal grandparents I developed a strong love of animals. We had our own gentleman&#8217;s farm for a while before we moved to Buffalo. My father was not as much of an animal person but he supported my mother and me in our animal husbandry efforts, so we always had pets wherever we lived, and when we lived in Maine we had chickens and sheep and horses and so forth.         So that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always stayed with me, so I&#8217;ve always had a love for the country and for animals and for books. Because we lived out in the country for my formative years I played a lot by myself and with my animals, and so I developed a strong imagination and a strong desire to be by myself a lot.
EF: That&#8217;s all right.
KSP: I&#8217;ve always enjoyed that and I still enjoy that.
EF: A bit introverted.
KSP: I&#8217;m actually, on whatever the test is, I&#8217;m&#8211;.
EF: The Myers-Briggs.
KSP: Yes. I am fifty-one percent E and forty-nine percent I, so.
EF: Oh, okay. Toeing the line.
KSP: Yep. So, I&#8217;m comfortable either way, but I get energy from both, so I&#8217;m really schizophrenic that way. I&#8217;m also not ambidextrous but I use my left hand to write and my right hand for almost everything else.
EF: Oh. What&#8217;s the term for that?
KSP: I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think they have a term. Yeah, it&#8217;s very weird, and I have difficulty telling my right from left too, because of that.
EF: Oh, interesting. Well could you tell me a bit more about your education in grade school, middle school, high school and what those formative experiences were like?
KSP: Well, because we did move around some, I basically could divide my educational experience growing up into two categories: one, the years that I spent in Maine going to a very small rural school, which was excellent, an excellent school. When I moved from there my junior year to the large suburban high school outside of Buffalo, New York [I went from a class size of] fifty in Monmouth, Maine to five hundred in the suburban school. I actually approached the whole move with some excitement. I mean, I loved Maine, I loved my school, but I wanted to know what it would be like to live in a city and go to a large suburban school, so I was interested in the experience.         It was definitely several steps down in terms of education. For example, I was studying French in high school where we were reading French literature and studying French language and culture, and then I moved to the suburban school and we were just learning how to pass the French Regents exam. So I developed an appreciation for what I was able to have in my first few years of high school. It&#8217;s actually interesting: I, this morning, have been busy tweeting about&#8211;. There&#8217;s a controversial article out now in a leadership journal written by a former youth pastor who is serving in prison right now for statutory rape of one of his students, so it&#8217;s very controversial because the article is overly sympathetic to his perspective. A lot of people are upset about the article, so I&#8217;ve been tweeting about&#8211;. I mean it&#8217;s this problem that people don&#8217;t understand how pervasive this problem is. And when I was in that suburban high school, my junior year my health teacher tried to seduce me and, I mean, I wasn&#8217;t interested at all.         But anyway, so I have this contrast of experiences. I don&#8217;t want to overly romanticize my experience at Monmouth Academy but it was really a great school and a very different experience. Then I went to this large suburban school where all the stereotypical sorts of things happened: large school, a lot of partying going on, and this teacher, and it&#8217;s quite a contrast. I feel overall that was a very enriching experience. I&#8217;ve been able to experience both sides of the world.
EF: Okay. Could you also tell me a bit about, for lack of a better word, your religious background growing up, childhood through adolescence, that era?
KSP: So New England people are stereotypically very stoic and self-reliant, and so New England and Maine are not strongly religious communities. It&#8217;s not a strong religious community. People who have religion tend to keep it, like everything else, to themselves. So my parents both grew up in a Methodist background &#8211; or my father really not much of a church background &#8211; and so that&#8217;s how we started out. I was baptized at about the age of five or six in the Methodist Church and then my parents, when we moved to Buffalo, were introduced to an American Baptist congregation where we started going to church, and that&#8217;s where we really became more evangelical.         So at about seven or eight, I became involved in a more evangelical congregation and upbringing with Sunday school and vacation Bible school and all those sorts of things, so I did become a Christian at a young age. My strongest memory of claiming that Christian faith as my own wasn&#8217;t praying the typical sinner&#8217;s prayer that people talk about. I don&#8217;t know if or when I did that. But I do remember when we moved when I was in kindergarten, I remember my mother praying with me in my bedroom about my new home and new school, and I remember at that point that I had a faith in Jesus Christ hearing my prayer and being with me in this life transition. So I know then that I was saved and have never doubted that experience or that kind of relationship.         So, I grew up in the church, going to Sunday school and vacation Bible school and so forth. I went through some typical resentments or embarrassments or whatever, especially in Maine where I had no friends who went to church, really. Again it&#8217;s not a very religious area of the country, so that was my family and not the experience of my friends and other family members. So it did make me question, not my faith, but that cultural aspect of it, but because of that it wasn&#8217;t something that I necessarily took for granted. I mean it was something I had to be thoughtful and intentional about, even at that age. It wasn&#8217;t a cultural expectation, which is radically different from what I&#8217;ve observed, having moved to the South. So I&#8217;m thankful for that, so even though one of my older brothers really has rejected the faith, even though he grew up the same way I did, and the other one hasn&#8217;t rejected it but doesn&#8217;t really live according to it. Of the three children I&#8217;m really the only one who both accepts it intellectually and tries to live by it in terms of my practice, so. My parents both remain very involved in church. They live here now.
EF: Oh, they do?
KSP: Yeah. We built them a house in the back.
EF: Oh, no kidding?
KSP: Yeah.
EF: That&#8217;s great. I drove down there first.
KSP: Oh, okay.
EF: Okay, great. Well you mentioned growing up with a passion for reading and learning, and books especially, so could you tell me the story about higher education, where you went to undergrad and then your path towards a PhD in literature?
KSP: Right. So I grew up loving books and always did well in English in school, regardless of which school I was in, either my school in Monmouth or the large suburban school. But I always saw reading and books as something fun and something that I loved, but I never really understood it as something that could be studied and taken seriously. I mean, I don&#8217;t know where I got the idea. I think the first time I got the idea must have been when we had some young people from a visiting church staying at our house who were college students, and I that&#8217;s when I first remember hearing about college, because my mother-. They both attended college. My mother graduated from, like, a business school and my father attended college but didn&#8217;t finish, so it wasn&#8217;t necessarily assumed that I would go to college or that any of us would go to college. We could if we wanted to but it wasn&#8217;t an expectation the way it is for many students today.
EF: Right.
KSP: So as soon as I understood, or was introduced to the idea of college, I knew I was going to go to college and I couldn&#8217;t wait to be a college student, probably because of these college girls who stayed at our house one night. So I always planned to go to college, I always planned to have a career. And first I wanted to be a veterinarian, so when I was in junior high I actually did a little internship type thing with our local veterinarian. He thought I was really good. He would come and take care of my horses and I was really good at helping him hold the horse while he did surgery and things like that. But then I read a book called Sybil about a woman who had multiple personality disorder. It turned out that the story was a fake. It came out years later. But it was supposed to be a true story and then they made a film of it and it fascinated me, so I wanted to be a psychiatrist.         But then by the time I was in high school I had become bored by school and wasn&#8217;t really challenged. School wasn&#8217;t treated as something serious. It was easy for me and I didn&#8217;t yet understand the idea of the life of the intellect and taking that seriously. It was just school. Even though I loved it and enjoyed it, it wasn&#8217;t like something that I understood I could focus on. So I thought, well, I wanted to go to college and didn&#8217;t want to go beyond that, so I would study social work instead of going on for eight years and getting an MD and being a psychiatrist.         So then when I got to college and began studying social work two things happened. I began studying social work and realized how much of it is involved in government red tape, and I didn&#8217;t want any part of that. At that same time I was taking English in college and for the first time being challenged and understanding that English is something that you can study intellectually and not just for fun. So I switched to be an English major and I did not want to teach, or so I thought, so I minored in public relations and communication because I thought that I should do something practical, which is terrible advice which I never give anybody today, to follow a course because it&#8217;s practical.         So, I did an internship in a marketing office my senior year and discovered there that I hated offices and cubicles and pantyhose. I didn&#8217;t know what else to do so I applied to a PhD program in my town and got in. So, that&#8217;s how I ended up in a PhD program.
EF: That was SUNY-Buffalo?
KSP: Yes.
EF: And where was your undergrad?
KSP: Daemen College, a small formerly-Catholic women&#8217;s college, very small, fourteen hundred students when I went there. I went there because they had a social work program where you could get your master&#8217;s in social work in five years, and that&#8217;s why I went there but I switched to English and stayed. So I went into the PhD [program] because I was accepted. I didn&#8217;t apply anywhere else. It was a last minute thing and it was&#8211;.
EF: Oh, wow.
KSP: Yeah. I had no idea what I was doing. If I had known I&#8217;m sure I never would have done that. They didn&#8217;t have a master&#8217;s program at that point, so I went in straight from undergrad to the PhD program and was completely overwhelmed &#8211; and that was a whole other experience &#8211; and somehow, many years later, ended up finishing the program. [Laughs] In the meantime, after two years of coursework, I realized &#8211; because I didn&#8217;t get an assistantship. I just got admitted and went and saw that everybody else was teaching and I was like, oh, okay. I had never wanted to be a teacher or a nurse because they were what women were supposed to do or something, but I decided to try my hand at teaching, and then I discovered accidentally what I was created to do.
EF: Great. Well what was the graduate experience like at SUNY-Buffalo?
KSP: Well academically I was completely under-prepared for it. Basically what happened was, it was in the 1980s and there was a moment of panic across the country in the humanities when a lot of professors in the humanities were starting to retire. And in the 1980s the humanities had cycled out of favor so there weren&#8217;t a lot of students going into the humanities. So there were a few years of panic where there was a fear that there would not be enough people to replace the professors retiring from the humanities, so a lot of the PhD programs opened up their admission doors pretty wide, and that&#8217;s the only reason why I got in, I&#8217;m sure. I was local, for one thing. Most places don&#8217;t favor local students. I didn&#8217;t have a master&#8217;s degree, like most of them who were being admitted. I think I just got in on one of my professor&#8217;s recommendations. So, for example, the year that I came in they admitted about forty-something students. Within a few years, they kept cutting in half each year after that because they realized they were letting too many students in, and now I think they let in like five or six students a year. So to me I see it as providential I got in. I didn&#8217;t know why I was going. I wasn&#8217;t planning to teach, I had no idea what I was getting into, but that&#8217;s how I discovered what I was there to do.         So academically it was very overwhelming. I went from being a big fish in a small pond. I had won the English major&#8217;s award, a scholarship. I had the highest GPA as an English major in my little college and was the editor of the literary journal and all these things, which were very easy to do in a small college. And I went and I was the lowest, smallest fish in a very big pond, so it was really overwhelming. I mean, everyone&#8217;s experience in a PhD program is overwhelming in some respect, at least it should be, but it was really overwhelming for me.
EF: Sure.
KSP: Then more personally, I was a Christian. I was becoming more of a serious Christian. I was married at that point so my husband and I were going to church and we were going to a pretty conservative Baptist church. This was in the 1980s, so the culture wars were starting to happen. So I was becoming aligned with the conservative side in the culture wars, so culturally I was identifying myself as a conservative Christian, but I hadn&#8217;t really been introduced to the idea of being a Christian intellectual. So I was making that transition from personal faith to cultural engagement as a Christian, but the intellectual part wasn&#8217;t quite there for me yet.         So I went into the PhD program thinking that&#8211;. I mean, because I had this idea that if you studied English literature and you&#8217;re a graduate student that social activism would be really important. Like if you&#8217;re a social activist and you want to change the world and improve it, that&#8217;s a really good thing. I was na&#239;ve because I didn&#8217;t&#8211;. It was just when political correctness was coming in and I had no idea that it wasn&#8217;t just being politically and culturally active that mattered. It mattered which side of the issues you were on. So in other words, I thought that as long as you were out there trying to change the world, regardless of which side of the culture wars you were on, that would be good. So I was pretty na&#239;ve in thinking that being prolife &#8211; which I had just had a conversion to the prolife position before going into graduate school &#8211; I thought even if people disagreed with me, that they would respect that I was passionate about this issue. That wasn&#8217;t the case at all. I did not know what a volatile and passionate issue that was. I didn&#8217;t know what I was stepping into.         So, for example, I got to share an office with a TA in the program, and she was a lesbian. And she put her lesbian posters and flyers and things on the wall, and I was fine with that. It didn&#8217;t bother me at all. I felt like I was learning a lot from her and learning about this form of activism. So I started putting my prolife posters and flyers on the door. She had hers on the door and above her desk and I had mine, and then one day she met with me&#8211;. I laugh now because now I know how these things work and I didn&#8217;t then, but she did not want those things on her door.  And she said that we would have to call a truce and that she would take hers down if I would take mine down. We would take them down and put things only above our own desks instead of on the door, because she was so mortified and embarrassed to have prolife things on her door that she would rather take her own things down.         So that really took me aback because my whole approach is, I want to engage in the battle of ideas and I&#8217;m on the search for truth so I&#8217;m not afraid of any idea. As a matter of fact, I want to be exposed to as many ideas as possible because, who knows? Maybe I don&#8217;t quite have the truth, and that&#8217;s what I want. So the more ideas I&#8217;m exposed to, I feel like the more I know. I had never encountered the idea of suppressing things before. So that&#8217;s what we did. We took our flyers and posters off our door and had none, because she would prefer that than for me to have my prolife flyers on the door. So that was an interesting enlightenment for me.         I was the only Christian in the program that I know of. I think that there may have been one other pastor&#8217;s son in one of my classes who might have been a Christian, but he wasn&#8217;t putting things on his door so people knew, and I was really doing it very na&#239;vely. I wasn&#8217;t even trying&#8211;. I thought that you&#8217;re supposed to be passionate about what you believe in and that&#8217;s okay, but it wasn&#8217;t.         So another thing that I remember is taking a class in the English novel and our professor--. We were reading Jane Eyre, and in Jane Eyre the love interest of the protagonist, who wants to marry her, it turns out. He takes her to the altar and there it is revealed that he is already married and that his wife is insane and kept locked in an attic. So our professor, when we were discussing that, he asked the class&#8211;. It was a class of about twenty-five grad students and we talked about this idea. I mean, he brought in maybe a more modern-day example, like a spouse who has Alzheimer&#8217;s or something like that. And he asked us, he said, &#8220;How many of you think that it&#8217;s wrong for someone whose spouse is incapacitated to have a relationship?&#8221; I don&#8217;t remember exactly how he put it, but basically the story in Jane Eyre, or in more modern terms someone who has Alzheimer&#8217;s or something, so in other words the person who is sick would not know that their spouse was having another relationship. He asked, &#8220;How many of you think that&#8217;s wrong? Raise your hand.&#8221; I raised my hand and that other guy raised his hand, in the whole class, and our professor said, &#8220;That&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; and I don&#8217;t know what he thought or what he said.
EF: Right.
KSP: Later on, I had written a letter to the student newspaper taking a prolife position or something and I took a lot of flak for that. That guy, who was a pastor&#8217;s son, left a note in my mailbox and said that he thought that I was right or hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong or something like that. It was a note of support.         So, with that, and in the meantime &#8211; and I&#8217;m leaving out the most important thing, but setting the stage here. This was also the time when Operation Rescue, which was&#8211;. Do you know Operation Rescue?
EF: I don&#8217;t think so. Please tell me.
KSP: Okay. Operation Rescue was like this national movement of abortion protests where we would go to abortion clinics and sit down at the entrance of the abortion clinics so that the doctors could not get in and the patients could not get in to have their abortions. So right at the time when I was in graduate school and beginning, I mean this is what was going on, so it wasn&#8217;t just that I was putting up prolife literature on my door and it wasn&#8217;t just that I was speaking up in class but I was involved in Operation Rescue and after a couple of years of being involved in it I also became the spokesperson for it. So, while I was in graduate school I was being arrested for blockading abortion clinics so that the abortions could not take place, and that did not go over well with my professors and in my department.         It was all happening at the same time. I had my prolife conversion just the summer before starting graduate school. My church showed a video called The Silent Scream that shows an abortion taking place through sonogram, and I couldn&#8217;t even&#8211;. It was on a little TV on a stand, and I was sitting in the back, and I couldn&#8217;t even really see what was going on. I could just hear the narration. It was a program put on by our local crisis pregnancy center, and I remember my thought upon seeing that video. My thought was like&#8211;. It wasn&#8217;t even really about the abortion. It was like, "Wow." I had no idea that an abortion was killing a developing baby. I always thought it was a bunch of cells. But my thought was really about the woman, and I thought, "That must be a terrible thing for a woman to go through." And I said, "I want to help women not have to make that choice."         So that was the thought that it left me. I wasn&#8217;t really thinking as much about the baby, even though I saw, "Oh, that&#8217;s the baby." I thought that must be horrible for a woman to go through, and I thought I wanted to volunteer at that pregnancy center. It took me a year or so but that&#8217;s how I started. After I got into graduate school I became a volunteer at our local pregnancy center. And it was always really more about helping the woman, because I thought that was a baby, and I thought it must be horrible to feel like you had to do this, that was your best choice. So I was volunteering at the crisis pregnancy center for a year or two when Randall Terry, who was the leader of Operation Rescue, came to Buffalo and started talking about this rescue movement and my pastor started talking about it.         Because I was an activist and I&#8217;ve always been very bold and activist oriented, I mean I&#8217;m the kind of person who&#8211;. My husband had to step in one time when we were in a parking lot because two men were fighting and I was trying to break them up. I&#8217;m just a little bit foolish that way. I&#8217;m like, "Oh! Two men are fighting. They shouldn&#8217;t be doing that. I&#8217;m going to stop them." So I&#8217;ve always had that streak in me, like if I see something wrong I&#8217;m going to fix it without really thinking about it. So I can be a little bit impulsive but I really felt convicted about Operation Rescue. I really thought that if I wanted to&#8211;. I felt that women should not have to go through this and they were being victimized by our culture which was offering this as an easy solution, and by the abortion industry which was offering it, and of course the little babies too who were going to lose their lives. I felt like to peacefully sit there and prevent that from happening, in the same spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. &#8211; I mean I had studied him. Operation Rescue &#8211; and a lot of people don&#8217;t realize this &#8211; we had training. We studied Martin Luther King, Jr. We watched the videos. We watched what they did. We watched the nonviolence training and we were trained to pattern our behavior after that.         I know people disagree. They see it as violating a woman&#8217;s right to choose abortion and I understand that. But if everyone believed that these are children who are being killed in the abortion clinics then everyone would agree that it&#8217;s the right thing to do. Everyone would agree that it&#8217;s absolutely nothing to sit there and not allow it to happen, nonviolently and peacefully. So really the whole issue comes down to whether or not you believe those are unborn children or cells or some middle state or whatever. So, I understand both sides, but I happen to recognize that an unborn child is as helpless as a newborn, or a two-year-old. And so it&#8217;s a very reasonable thing to do, to sit in front of an abortion clinic and say to the women going in, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to do this,&#8221; but more importantly to the doctors who are about to do that, &#8220;This is not going to happen,&#8221; and to let that not take place unless they drag me away, which is what the police would do, drag us away.
EF: How many times were you arrested?
KSP: Four or five. Actually only a couple of those times were at the rescues themselves. The other times that I was arrested were when I was what we call sidewalk counseling. I don&#8217;t really like that term but that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called. We would stand outside the clinics and try to talk to the women going in and let them know that there was help available. I did that for years and we had many women who changed their mind. Most didn&#8217;t and most did not like us being out there, but there were many who did change their mind and I had many &#8220;saves,&#8221; we called them, over the years. But sometimes we would get arrested because the rules were always changing about where we could stand and how far we could go, and then it went to the Supreme Court. There was a Supreme Court ruling about our particular town and group and abortion clinics and bubble zones and so forth.
EF: Wow.
KWP: So, yeah, our case went to the Supreme Court. I did a lot of testifying in federal court before it went to the Supreme Court so there are a lot of transcripts in various court cases, because it went from a preliminary injunction stage to a permanent injunction stage all the way to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court case is called Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network. It was shortly after I moved here, so it was either 1999 or 2000 or something like that, Schenk v. Pro-Choice.         I had so much invested in the case. Basically it was a free speech case, so again it goes back to my passion for free speech because what the preliminary injunctions were saying is that&#8211;. They were called floating bubble zones. Basically, outside these clinics, they would establish these zones. You had to be back so many feet from the abortion clinic. But what made them unconstitutional is that only the prolifers had to be back. The prochoice protesters or escorts or whoever could be in them, so it basically boiled down to how would you know which person is prochoice or prolife? I mean, if they&#8217;re holding a sign, you know. If they&#8217;re wearing a prochoice apron, you know. But what if it&#8217;s some other citizen who&#8217;s there promoting legalization of marijuana or something? Because sometimes you would get all kinds of different protesters out there. What if someone&#8217;s walking by, never been there before, and happens to see the woman going in and says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll adopt your baby,&#8221; or something? Does that make them all of a sudden one of the prolife people who can&#8217;t be in the bubble zone? It&#8217;s very problematic. Then they were floating buffer zones too. Basically if a woman parked down the street and was walking toward the clinic then the prolifer could not be within fifteen feet of her, so that meant that it was moving, so it was a very, very problematic case.         Basically the ruling was a split ruling. It gave some victories to the Pro-Choice Network, who was the defendant at that point. It went back and forth but at the Supreme Court level they were the defendant. [The ruling gave] some victories to both sides. I was much younger then but I actually slept out on the sidewalk, in front of the Supreme Court in order to&#8211;. Because basically they have so many open seats that they give to hear [the arguments]. So that was such a big case at the time that a lot of people were wanting to see it, so I went and stood in line the day before and slept out overnight on the sidewalk in front of the Supreme Court and I got one of the last seats to hear the oral arguments. That was exciting.         So basically that&#8217;s what happened to Operation Rescue. Its back was broken by these preliminary injunctions that were put around. The other thing that was happening was instead of being arrested for violating a local trespassing law &#8211; which is what all these were &#8211; we would be arrested and we would be charged with trespassing or misdemeanor obstruction of administration of justice, something like that. We would go to court and we would be found guilty or not guilty and sentenced to time served or whatever. Most of the time we were found not guilty &#8211; because it was very hard to prosecute hundreds of people in one case, or whatever &#8211; or it would be thrown out, or time served, so I never served prison time or jail time after [going to court]. It was usually just the holding time, or there were a few days once in a makeshift jail when we had a big protest.         But basically these preliminary injunctions enacted by federal courts around the country broke the back of the movement because it made it a federal crime that could lead to imprisonment for years and seizure of all assets, and so that&#8217;s how they broke the back of the rescue movement.
EF: The organization no longer exists?
KSP: Yeah, it still exists. It may have changed its name and the leadership has changed several times. Actually one of the leaders, I don&#8217;t think he is anymore, but one of the leaders ended up being Flip Benham whose sons were involved in a&#8211;. Their show got cancelled. They had a reality TV show about construction or something that just got canceled by the cable station because people found out that they were prolife Christians and they protested. That was just this spring.
EF: Oh, really?
KSP: Yeah, yeah. So as a result of that, I mean there are still people who protest outside abortion clinics, still sidewalk counselors. That still goes on back in Buffalo. My uncle, who is retired now, sidewalk counsels over at the clinic where I used to go. But the real emphasis has moved more toward the crisis pregnancy centers. I mean those were always there, but they are doing a lot more of the effective work and a lot more expansive work. Now most of them have sonogram machines, or the one here in Lynchburg has not only the 3D sonograms but now they have a mobile unit. Of course Lynchburg isn&#8217;t a&#8211;. We don&#8217;t have any abortion clinics here. It doesn&#8217;t mean women aren&#8217;t going other places to get abortions, but it&#8217;s a very different situation than in a place like Buffalo where there are five abortion clinics serving all over and abortions taking place multiple times every day of the week.         So, that&#8217;s a long way of answering. All this was going on while I was in graduate school. That&#8217;s a pretty awkward combination, to be a PhD student in a liberal department in a liberal university in a liberal discipline and being on television for being arrested for denying women their civil rights.
EF: Right.
KSP: Yeah.
EF: So all of your activity &#8211; the sidewalk counseling, the sit-in type protests &#8211; that was all in Buffalo?
KSP: Yeah.
EF: Okay. I want to come back and ask more about your involvement with the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center once you came to Lynchburg, but before then can you talk a bit about after you finished your PhD? I was looking into your record. I think you wrote on abolitionism and Hannah More? Is that right?
KSP: Mm hmm, right.
EF: And you have a book coming out, is that right, about it?
KSP: Mm hmm.
EF: Okay, great. It&#8217;s based on your dissertation I guess?
KSP: Right.
EF: Okay, great. That must feel good too.
KSP: Yeah. It does.
EF: Well can you talk about&#8211;? I don&#8217;t know the exact timeline, but once you graduate with your PhD what did you do up until the point of when you came to Liberty? And how did you come to Liberty?
KSP: Well, I finished my coursework pretty quickly, like in two years, took my comps, did all that the way you&#8217;re supposed to, but then I got more involved in the prolife efforts and got involved in teaching at a Christian school while I was doing my dissertation research. So all this was going on while I was supposedly researching and writing my dissertation, which I was working on, which was very hard. I was done with my coursework so I&#8217;m in isolation working on this, plus I&#8217;m working fulltime, plus I&#8217;m doing this prolife stuff, and plus no one likes me.         I was having a little bit of a hard time getting a committee. But, it did happen. Originally, because my area was the English novel, I was planning on writing my dissertation on the eighteenth century novelist Samuel Richardson, spinning my wheels, doing years of research, and trying to figure out what I wanted to write while doing all these other things. I had a committee together finally of decent people who could look beyond the political and cultural differences, and I discovered Hannah More, in my research for Samuel Richardson, who was a later eighteenth century poet, dramatist, and then later became a conservative evangelical and became a reformer and abolitionist. She wrote one novel, which no one&#8217;s ever heard of and no one would want to read today, but her novel was one of the first bestsellers in England. I argue in my dissertation &#8211; that&#8217;s what I shifted my topic to &#8211; that her novel, which is so didactic and dry today, actually helped to elevate the literary status of the novel so that it could become what it became in the Victorian era.         So I spent a number of years doing the research and once I stumbled across Hannah More it was a year later, basically, that I was done. So I was slated to finish my dissertation and defend in the spring, and it turned into summer, of 1999, so I was finishing up when Liberty University was advertising. I came down and interviewed in February of 1999, when I finishing my dissertation and it was looking like it would be done and it would pass, so I had the job already when I defended in July of 1999. It was really a big deal because of the glut that I mentioned earlier of PhD candidates in English. Nobody with a PhD in English was getting a job, for the most part, so that&#8217;s one reason why they stopped admitting so many students into the program. The day that I finished my dissertation it was in the summer and there weren&#8217;t a lot of people around but my dissertation chair was going&#8211;. We had to go to the office and finish paperwork so whoever he saw in the hallway, he was saying, &#8220;Oh, yeah, this is Karen. She just defended her dissertation, and she has a fulltime job!&#8221; The departments care when their people get jobs. It was really neat because I was one of the few who had a fulltime job as soon as I finished, and that was at Liberty. So it was neat that the one Christian in the department got the job, got a job, so quickly. So as soon as I finished my dissertation I came to Liberty, so that&#8217;s how I got here.
EF: Great. Well can you talk a bit about the early years here at Liberty, what that was like, not just in the English department but also maybe at the university at-large and then the wider community?
KSP: Well it&#8217;s really funny because obviously, what I just described, I was leaving a very liberal university where I was viewed as this really conservative person and I really didn&#8217;t fit in for that reason, and then I came to Liberty and I was viewed as kind of like a feminist and a liberal at Liberty because it&#8217;s all relative. I still have it. By the time I left Buffalo a local chapter of Feminists for Life had started and a lot of the women who started it actually had claimed me as an inspiration to them for starting it, so when I left they gave me a plaque for my leadership in Buffalo Feminists for Life and I had it in my office.         I am conservative, obviously, but at a place like Liberty in 1999, at a time when the female students were still required to wear dresses or skirts and the men were required to wear a shirt and tie to class, and I came with my New York dress and experience and my understanding of how to engage with liberals and Democrats and homosexuals and whoever, with whom I was often really more comfortable talking than some of the Bible Belt Southerners. So it was an interesting&#8211;. Personally it was odd to go from one extreme environment to another and to still feel like I&#8217;m the same person but to have a different place. But I was very well-received at Liberty. It turned out a lot of my friends told me later that they were surprised that I went to Liberty and they thought that I wouldn&#8217;t last very long there, it&#8217;s an excellent fit and Liberty has received me well and I won a teaching award a few years&#8211;.
EF: Oh, great. Congratulations.
KSP: Like the teaching award of all the faculty. Just a few years after being there, I think in 2003, they made me department chair.  So I feel like, because theologically and doctrinally I believe everything that Liberty does, the important stuff, and I&#8217;m very conservative in my Christian doctrine and practice, so that gives me the freedom that in this culture, in the Bible Belt, a lot of people don&#8217;t necessarily feel or understand.         So I feel like I can &#8211; because I&#8217;ve had people at Liberty ask me, &#8220;How do you get away with what you get away with?&#8221; and I&#8217;m like, "What do I get away with?" There&#8217;s nothing that I get away with. I think what they mean by that is me being me, but that&#8217;s not in conflict with anything Liberty stands for. So, I don&#8217;t know. I mean one person told me that before I came&#8211;. She said that she felt like I brought freedom to not wear like a suit to teach in, a dress suit, and I said, &#8220;Did anybody ever tell you you had to wear a suit?&#8221; and she said no and I said, &#8220;Why did you?&#8221; But she felt that she had to. So, I guess there are manners that often accompany certain principles and doctrines and beliefs, but they don&#8217;t necessarily go together and some people get them confused. I&#8217;ve never abided by those manners but at the same time believe vehemently and passionately in the principles, I guess, that sometimes result in the manners that we see here, if that makes sense.
EF: It does. I guess it&#8217;s part of the southern culture and maybe a little bit of a conflict that your own life experience up to that point wasn&#8217;t involved in that, and so there is a bit of a feeling-out process. That&#8217;s what it sounds like.
KSP: Yeah, yeah. There&#8217;s nothing about being a conservative Christian that means you have to dress a certain way, but for some people that was a revelation, I guess. I mean, it&#8217;s a very simple example but an important one.
EF: Well, in coming to Lynchburg and joining the faculty at Liberty, can you also talk about how you translated your activism from Buffalo down South?
KSP: Yeah, well shortly after arriving here I did end up serving on the board of directors of the local crisis pregnancy center for about seven years and eventually rotated off. And again there aren&#8217;t abortion clinics here, so it doesn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s not a need to help women in crisis pregnancy centers. My personality is more like, I want to be on the front lines of wherever the pressing cultural need is. I mean, I&#8217;ve learned that about myself. So I don&#8217;t feel as compelled here to be&#8211;. Of course I&#8217;m still prolife. The way that I put it in an earlier interview is that I feel this&#8211;. In the New Testament there was this call from Macedonia to come and help, the &#8220;Macedonian Call&#8221; that Paul talks about, answering the call. So of course there is a need here to speak out from a prolife perspective and to help women who might be making those decisions, but it&#8217;s not as pressing a need here.         So when I came here I just&#8211;. I feel the call of different needs in the South, and one of them that seems so blatantly obvious to me in moving down here is the issue of animal welfare because it&#8217;s just cultural. In the Northern culture, because of climate and other things, most pets are treated&#8211;. You don&#8217;t find animals that are roaming and left outside, unneutered, and down here it&#8217;s just a different&#8211;. It&#8217;s rural, the climate is warmer so it&#8217;s not as cruel to leave animals outside, but there&#8217;s a culture that comes with that in a sense of animals are left to fend for themselves. People have animals and they just leave them out and don&#8217;t neuter them, so there&#8217;s this overabundance of puppies and kittens that all end up being euthanized or they get taken up north to be adopted because there are no puppies and kittens up north, because everyone spays and neuters. There&#8217;s a lot more animal neglect and abuse down here, [so because] I&#8217;ve always been an animal lover, moving down here has made me see that there&#8217;s a need for education and awareness in animal welfare issues, as well as environmental issues.         Another moment of culture shock moving down here was when I came to Liberty they didn&#8217;t even recycle paper &#8211; I mean, now we do &#8211; and even in the communities. I mean, we don&#8217;t have pickup for recycling here in Amherst. They have bins. So the things that were automatic in the North &#8211; everyone recycled and it was very convenient &#8211; it&#8217;s harder here, so there needs to be education and commitment and awareness. Again, I feel like I&#8217;m the same person, I haven&#8217;t shifted, but the need has changed. So I&#8217;m doing the same thing down here that I was up there. I mean I was recycling up there, I recycle down here, but now I feel, "Okay, we need to be a little bit more vocal about it and educate people about animal welfare and being good stewards across the board, whether it&#8217;s animals or recycling."         So eventually some students came to me at Liberty and asked me to be the advisor for [what&#8217;s now called the] Students for Stewardship group. In the past I&#8217;ve been asked to advise for the prolife group but the prolife group&#8217;s never really&#8211;. They come and go, students come and go, and, again, it&#8217;s important but it&#8217;s almost redundant to have a prolife group at Liberty University. It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t things to be done. My gifting, apparently, is more like where there&#8217;s education needed or a big gap that needs to be filled. That&#8217;s where I get really passionate.         So I&#8217;ve gone more in that direction. A few years ago I was asked to serve on a newly established faith advisory council for the Humane Society of the United States, so I serve on that and I advocate. I had a letter to the editor in the paper this week, in the Lynchburg paper, because a nearby county is changing its zoning laws to allow concentrated animal feeding operations, which is basically factory farming which we don&#8217;t have here, and not it&#8217;s going to come. So I&#8217;m trying to advocate against that.
EF: Right. Well that sounds like, not meaning to generalize, but your stances on animal rights and the environment&#8211;.
KSP: And by the way, I use the term &#8220;animal welfare&#8221; because I don&#8217;t believe in animal rights.
EF: Okay. Thanks for clarifying.
KSP: A lot of people use the terms interchangeably but I don&#8217;t believe that animals have rights; I believe we have an obligation and a duty and a responsibility for their welfare, but they have no rights.
EF: Well thank you for clarifying.
KSP: Yeah.
EF: So it sounds like your positions on animal welfare as well as environmental recycling concerns, that doesn&#8217;t always seem to be in the mainstream conservative ethos, I suppose.
KSP: Right, right.
EF: So do you see yourself as kind of off at a distance? I guess I&#8217;m wondering how you see those positions here in Lynchburg as being complementary or contradictory to conservatism at-large.
KSP: Yeah, the problem is &#8211; and this is just human nature &#8211; I think we tend to take our positions based on people rather than principle. So the animal welfare and environmental causes were abandoned for a long time by Christians, not in history but in more recent times &#8211; and I&#8217;ll get back to that &#8211; so they get hijacked by Leftist groups so then Christians think those are Leftist issues [when they really aren&#8217;t.] I mean, to me it&#8217;s all about being consistent. Wes hould not be destroying God&#8217;s creation unnecessarily and I see abortion as an unnecessary destruction of God&#8217;s image. I do eat meat. I believe that that is biblical, although a good argument can be made that that&#8217;s the result of the fall and won&#8217;t be eating meat in the new heaven and new earth. It&#8217;s okay, but we still need to be humane and kind, that&#8217;s very, very biblical, but the problem is that people see those issues in political terms or in personality terms and so because an x, y, z group or x, y person advocates for it we have to be against it. That&#8217;s just silly, foolish, and wrong, but that is human nature.         So, yeah; down in my environment at Liberty it&#8217;s a little bit of a contrarian position. I&#8217;ve gotten into a little bit of heat over it. Well, I did ask a leader to not bring the circus in as a fundraiser because of the circus&#8217;s use, and abuse, of animals.
EF: Right.
KSP: So I had a disagreement with a leader over that. But I mean to me it&#8217;s a consciousness. Eventually they did stop doing it, so it&#8217;s a consciousness-raising, and I&#8217;m an educator. That&#8217;s my passion. I&#8217;m a teacher, so for me all these issues really are about&#8211;. In large part they&#8217;re about education. At some point the depravity of human nature comes in and it&#8217;s not a matter of education. It&#8217;s a matter of something else. But a lot of it&#8217;s education, educating people that this is a stewardship issue, this is a biblical issue. We need to do the right thing regardless of how someone else is doing it wrong or doing it for a different purpose. It doesn&#8217;t matter that some people advocate for animal welfare and animal rights because they don&#8217;t believe that human beings are made in God&#8217;s image. That doesn&#8217;t matter. We should be the ones doing the right thing for the right reason and setting the example instead of abandoning these issues.         But this does go back to Hannah More, if you would like me to talk about that a little bit.
EF: Please do.
KSP: Okay. So Hannah More was part of a group of conservative evangelicals in the late eighteenth, early nineteenth century who also strove for this consistency in their ethos and their praxis. So the very same people, like Hannah More, and her better-known friend William Wilberforce, and John Newton, who are most known for basically abolishing the slave trade in England, at the same time that they were working on the abolitionist movement they were establishing the first animal welfare organization. They established the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the RSPCA. In America its counterpart is the ASPCA. They established the first laws in England to prohibit animal cruelty.         They addressed, not to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction, but they addressed labor and factory bills to address abuses taking place with the workers there. They established some of the earliest &#8211; not the earliest but some of the earliest &#8211; Sunday schools, which Sunday schools then were not [like] Sunday schools today. It was school on Sunday for the poor, so they were taught reading and arithmetic and so forth because Sunday was the only day that they weren&#8217;t working. So Hannah More established a number of Sunday schools throughout her region. They were philanthropists who alleviated the poor. She wrote tracts to teach the poor to read and the tracts that she wrote, that would be appealing to them, included tips on frugality and recipes and how to make their lives a little bit better through stretching their dollars and being more responsible and so forth.         So this group of conservative evangelicals in the nineteenth century basically reformed society from top to low. Hannah More also wrote tracts and treatises to the upper classes asking them to, assessing the state of their religion and their morality and asking them to change a number of practices that she thought were wrong, including gambling, dueling, exploiting servants, not observing Sabbath. Which actually not observing the Sabbath ended up victimizing the poor more because by not observing the Sabbath, they were asking their servants to work on Sundays, which was really their only day of rest. So the moral implications were greater than what we might understand today.         So it was a widespread, across-the-board attempt at reform of all strata of society, and that&#8217;s the heritage of conservative evangelicals. But a lot of us don&#8217;t know that because we are too politicized and align our activism with party rather than principle.
EF: So in your forthcoming book on Hannah More, from what you just said, are you tying together some of these different strands?
KSP: Yeah.
EF: I guess what do you hope your book and your study of Hannah More will accomplish maybe in the wider public?
KSP: Well, it is a biography. I&#8217;m presenting this interesting and fascinating person to the world and not necessarily saying what people should do with her, but I do think she is a role model. The chapters are arranged&#8211;. I mean obviously a biography has to move chronologically, so I do that, but I wrote chapters loosely thematically. I try to talk about each of the areas that she worked in, in different chapters, so the Sunday school, the abolitionist movement, that takes a couple of chapters, the animal welfare movement, reform for the poor, female education. So in writing her life I am trying to present her as a role model for today, somebody who went beyond party lines and tried to apply her Christian belief in a very holistic way across all of society, to apply it to her own life but also to apply those principles to change her society, and she did.
EF: Right. Of course I&#8217;ve seen you write actively in different journals, magazines, newspapers, that sort of thing. Can you talk a bit about your activism through the form of writing?
KSP: Yeah, and that&#8217;s one of the changes that&#8217;s taken place. I mean I&#8217;m not out protesting at abortion clinics, or anywhere, but I&#8217;m writing more and that goes along with being a professor so it&#8217;s a natural evolution. But I have been fortunate to have a lot of doors open up in writing, ones that I didn&#8217;t necessarily even seek, so I am using writing as a form of activism, from letters to the editor &#8211; I just wrote another one today, locally &#8211; to the journals that you mentioned, online magazines and so forth, and I do cover a range of issues. It&#8217;s hard for me not to. I write about abortion a fair amount but I write about a lot of other issues too. So I&#8217;m trying to take this holistic approach and apply what I see as pretty simple principles about being good stewards and being faithful Christians and apply it to all of life.
EF: Right, right. I also wanted to circle back to the role you played at the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center since arriving here. You said you served on the board for a number of years. Can you talk about your relationship with them through the years?
KSP: Yeah. Well, when I served on the board it was a very, very struggling ministry. Our director was a volunteer, and so forth. So basically those seven years that I served on the board we saw it go from a part-time volunteer director to a fulltime paid director, so when I rotated off &#8211; I say &#8220;rotated off.&#8221; We didn&#8217;t even have a rotation and we had to establish it because some of us had been on there for a pretty long time. We had seen it grow so much, even facility-wise. We had to move the facility to a bigger place.         So when I rotated off it was in a really good state. It&#8217;s only improved since then. I get requests every now and then to keep in mind coming back on the board when it&#8217;s a good time. I&#8217;m very distant to it now. I go to the dinner every year and try to sponsor a table at their fundraising dinner. But again as the writing opportunities increase I really am able to do less and less of anything, so I don&#8217;t do a lot anymore besides teaching and writing.
EF: Right, right. I have one final question, and it circles back also to when you mentioned you first arrived at Liberty [and] you had a certificate in your office for Feminists for Life, so feminism, so I wanted to ask you&#8211;.
KSP: Yeah, Feminists for Life.
EF: Right, Feminists for Life.
KSP: Yeah, a plaque.
EF: Oh, right. So I wanted to ask you about feminism in general and to get your thoughts on what you think of as feminism, how maybe you add to it or change it, or what feminism means to you, I suppose.
KSP: Well there are many feminisms and even feminists don&#8217;t agree on what feminism is. If you look up the word in the dictionary [it] basically says someone who advocates equal civil and political rights for women, so if you go by that definition I hope most of us are feminists. I really appreciate the right to vote and the right to work and so forth.
EF: Sure.
KSP: Because there are so many different definitions of it and there&#8217;s a lot of disagreement over what a feminist is, I don&#8217;t necessarily claim the title. If someone calls me a feminist, that&#8217;s fine. I don&#8217;t consider myself a feminist by some of the definitions that are used today. So it&#8217;s not a word that I&#8217;m afraid of, it&#8217;s not a word that I embrace. It&#8217;s not really a very helpful term in most contexts, I don&#8217;t think, today, but I do think it&#8217;s important historically.         Feminism was very, very important in making advances for women that were needed and necessary, and some that may continue to be necessary, but a lot of people don&#8217;t know that the early feminists were very prolife. I mean abortions were obviously taking place then and they saw abortion as victimizing women and exploiting women, I mean all of them, Susan B. Anthony for one. So I have a fondness for classical feminism, and I think it&#8217;s a shame that the word has connotations today that don&#8217;t really reflect the wonderful origins of the movement, when the first feminists were fighting for the right to vote and fighting to improve the state of women who were being exploited by prostitution and abortion and things like that. So, if someone wants to call me that I&#8217;m okay with it.
EF: Sure.
KSP: I don&#8217;t claim it because some other people who claim the title would not appreciate my positions on other things.
EF: Okay. Well that concludes my questions. Is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to say or things that I should have asked?
KSP: There was one thing I wanted to add that I left out of my time in Buffalo and being a prolife activist. And by the way, during those years that was my title. I actually had a business card, &#8220;Prolife Activist.&#8221; I mean I&#8211;
EF: Really?
KSP: &#8211;didn&#8217;t make money off of it, obviously, but&#8211;.
EF: Do you still have some?
KSP: I don&#8217;t know if I have some up in the attic or anywhere. I don&#8217;t know. But because I did a lot of public speaking&#8211;. Oh, I actually ran for lieutenant governor of New York for the Right to Life party. We have a lot of third parties in New York State.
EF: Wow, okay.
KSP: That was in 1998. So I really was very much a prolife activist. I did a lot of interviews and so forth. But I talked a little bit about how I understand the other perspective, like if I didn&#8217;t believe that the unborn child was a child I&#8217;d be so out there with the prochoice activists. I&#8217;d be on their side. So to me it really does come down to that&#8211;. Well, I don&#8217;t know; probably, if we really were talking about healthcare. But I really do empathize with other points of view and I do really believe that most prochoice people and even some abortion doctors &#8211; not all but some &#8211; really are trying to help women, even though I think they&#8217;re wrong and misguided in how they&#8217;re doing it, but I still understand that.         So I did get involved in something called Common Ground and it was a movement that brought together prolife and prochoice activists to basically say, "Okay, we disagree about what abortion is and whether it should be legal or not, but what can we agree on?" That was really hard work but I loved that work. We went around the country doing workshops, speaking. I coauthored a monograph with a former abortion clinic director, although she was an abortion clinic director at the time, about the ethics of sidewalk counseling. Basically we came together and we said, "Okay, we both believe that we&#8217;re both trying to help women, even though we disagree with how we&#8217;re doing it. What can we agree on?" So we wrote this monograph, which is on Amazon but I can&#8217;t remember the title of it. &#8220;Common Ground on Abortion Clinic Activism,&#8221; that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called.
EF: Okay.
KSP: So I would meet with abortion doctors, prochoice activists, along with other prolife people, and we would sit down and hammer out the areas of agreement that we have. I did this for a number of years and that&#8217;s really where I ended up pouring my energy. And I love that model and I wish that more people who are passionate about issues would spend time focusing on where we agree as much, if not more than, where we disagree, and I think we could accomplish a lot more. I took a lot of criticism for it, especially among the male leaders of the Operation Rescue, whatever it was then, quoting scripture at me like, &#8220;What has darkness to do with light,&#8221; and so forth.
EF: Whoa.
KSP: And a lot of people thought it was wrong to do that, it was partnering with the enemy or something, but I believe very, very much in that effort of finding common ground, and I&#8217;ve done similar things of late. I was invited to what&#8217;s called the Common Ground Film Festival in LA earlier this year, which is an attempt to bring together faith communities and the LGBQT community and talk. They didn&#8217;t use this term but it&#8217;s really finding common ground, basically bringing people of different convictions on LGBQT issues to say, "What can we learn from each other without asking anyone to give up their commitments, their beliefs?"
EF: Right.
KSP: So I&#8217;m a great believer in common ground.
EF: Well I&#8217;m glad you added that, and can I also ask you to detail a little bit about your run for lieutenant governor?
KSP: Yeah. Well in New York State there are a lot of third parties. There&#8217;s a Marijuana party, a Green party, a Right to Life party; not all states have those, at least not to the extent that New York does. So obviously when you&#8217;re running on a third party ticket your goal is not necessarily&#8211;. You&#8217;re not going to necessarily win the election. Some people think you&#8217;re just taking away from one of the two major parties which, yes, you are. So by running on the Right to Life ticket, if there&#8217;s no candidate on the major ticket who adheres to the principles then you are sending a message to the major parties that this position on the issue counts, so that&#8217;s the strategy behind it. Usually the Right to Life party in New York takes one to two percent of the vote. Yeah, that was really our goal. In New York also the governor and lieutenant governor run on the same ticket. In Virginia it&#8217;s two separate candidates, but you vote for both in New York.         Basically it was a platform to go around to the debates and so forth and to get the prolife message out there. I think we took like one and a half percent of the vote or something like that, but it was a really good opportunity. I got to speak at a lot of places. We ended up using most of our leftover campaign money&#8211;. At the end we still had a lot of money to spend, so I produced some radio ads that featured the heartbeat of an unborn child and I was talking, and it was very powerful. And again [I] used it really as an educational opportunity. So those ads, [we used them to educate people] about the development of the unborn child and ask people to vote prolife.         So it was an interesting&#8211;. I&#8217;m not a politician. I would never do it again, actually, but conservatives especially have a lot to learn about how to effectively reach today&#8217;s population, and that running the same old white men all the time is not going to work. So I think we live in a diverse time with diverse people and voices and conservatives are diverse, and if the conservatives, whether Christians or politicians, want to survive they need to tap into those diverse experiences and voices, if they want to really effect change.         That&#8217;s what the Clapham Sect did in their more limited way. I mean obviously England in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century was not a really diverse country, but, as I talk about in my book, they really were willing to transcend the usual political and socioeconomic lines in order to bring about widespread change. So I think that&#8217;s what conservatives need to do if they want to be smart and successful today.        EF: Well, thank you for your time and for sharing everything.        KSP: You&#8217;re welcome.         EF: I appreciate it.        KSP: I hope it wasn&#8217;t too much or too little        EF: Oh, no. It was perfect.
