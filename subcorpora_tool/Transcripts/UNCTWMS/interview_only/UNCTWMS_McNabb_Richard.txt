Jessie Wilkerson: This is Jessie Wilkerson and I&#8217;m with Dick McNabb in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the date is May 11, 2011. So, Dick, can you first say when and where you were born?
Richard McNabb: I was born here in Knoxville, 1939, October 15, of a family that goes back several generations in Knoxville.
JW: Can you tell me a little bit about what you know about your family history?
RM: Well, it&#8217;s rather a remarkable history as it relates to Knoxville, mostly through my grandmother&#8217;s family. A fellow named Charles McClung left Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and came to Knox County in about 1793 and he married a woman that was the daughter of James White, who was the founder of Knoxville, and he for years up into the late 1830s was the county court clerk in Knoxville and established himself with quite a reputation, and he did what other people do, or did then, speculated in land and owned slaves and had a nice house and a rather large family. That&#8217;s what people did then. My grandmother was probably the fourth generation from that beginning in Knox County. Her father was a merchant named C.M. McClung who owned a large wholesale hardware here and she married my grandfather, William Ross. He was originally from Anderson County but his father had moved to Knox County and started a wholesale grocery business. McClung, my great-grandfather, was very much interested in local history, so he left a collection of local history, in fact regional history, that was given to the Knox County Library and is called the McClung Collection there. So anyway, my grandmother was interested in community projects and my grandfather was interested in business things. My grandmother started, I think, the Junior League in Knoxville back maybe before World War, in that area I think, and the Knoxville Garden Club, and in the [19]20s organized the first Planned Parenthood along with other people.   So from that background my mother started a mental health center here in Knoxville. Then a generation later I started this Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health. You know, throughout that time things were not done as they are now with government programs and grants. They were community projects where people with some wealth or some influence in the community would come together and see a need and promote that and start a not-for-profit kind of an enterprise with a local board usually of influential people. And they would either have an angel, or they would seek contributions from the community, and they got things done. I mean Child and Family Services was another of Grandmother&#8217;s projects that she got started in the &#8217;30s, that handled abortions-excuse me, not abortions. It handled adoptions, and Planned Parenthood was closely related with the Child and Family Services when I began with Planned Parenthood because they shared a building and both were important in the community. And yet the community was much smaller then. I mean it was easier to be important.
JW: Were the women in your family educated? How did they get involved in these social work activities?
RM: Well, you know, if you look at someone like my grandmother she would tell you that she had no education, and yet she went to what was called a finishing school. And she ate all of her meals with people that were educated and that were important in the community, and she was one of them. So I always thought she was one of the smartest people I knew, but she was very humble about her education. We all in the course of our lives do a lot of self educating. I didn&#8217;t know how to start the Knoxville Center or start a nonprofit, but I sure learned. And outside of anything that I learned in school. I was trained to be an accountant and certainly I used some of that to try to keep the organization going and meet a payroll, which you have to do, and keep ends meeting. Perhaps that was one of the most important things I did, because with my role in the Knoxville Center it didn&#8217;t take me long to figure out that a man really had no place there. It was a woman&#8217;s organization. I was the only male employee and the service is so much about privacy that I pretty much felt like I needed to not be seen and not be heard so I stayed in the background and oversaw things and didn&#8217;t remember names and didn&#8217;t remember faces and that, to my way of thinking, is the way it should have been. I could have an important role in the background.
JW: Was your grandmother involved in suffrage activities or the earlier women&#8217;s rights campaigns?
RM: You know, I don&#8217;t know that. She may well have been. She and my grandfather were very different. I read-it hasn&#8217;t been ten or twelve years ago-something that he had written, and he felt that the two worst things that had happened to the country were women getting the right to vote and the direct popular election of senators. Before that changed they had been elected by the state senate. So he was a pretty conservative guy, or to my way of thinking. Maybe that wasn&#8217;t so much that way in his-. I don&#8217;t know what his reasons for thinking those things were but they&#8217;re very different from what I think.   But anyway, my grandparents opposed each other for the most part in political things, her being a rather liberal person and he being a rather conservative person, and they honestly didn&#8217;t discuss the differences because they felt it worked better in their household not to discuss it. One of the examples that was used in my growing up and in my family that everybody laughed about was that he owned a company that was selling some kind of a patent medicine that was probably twenty or twenty-five percent alcohol, and she was very active in opposing those kind of patent medicines that did nobody any good. So they both took their stand, and they never discussed it. [Laughs] And the medicine continued to be sold, I think. I remember because in my grandfather&#8217;s den there were a couple of bottles of that stuff [Laughs] with all the labeling and promises that it made, so it was kind of a humorous thing, but that&#8217;s the way it was.   Certainly in my mother and father&#8217;s marriage what she did about mental health was never a topic of discussion that I was aware of with my father. He was involved in his business and this was what she did during the day. And the people that she was doing that with did not call at night. She devoted her attention to him at night, and he was not neglected. I always felt as a child we were somewhat neglected by all these long rambling phone calls.
JW: And what did your father do?
RM: He started out in the family wholesale hardware business and then left there and started his own mill supply business, selling industrial supplies. It was not a large enterprise, but he made a living at it and it kept him busy.
JW: And had your mother gone to college?
RM: Yes, she went four years at the University of Tennessee and then got a master&#8217;s degree from the University of Tennessee in psychology, which in the mid &#8217;30s was a fair amount of education for a woman. I don&#8217;t know how many women were PhDs at that point, but not that many.
JW: And how did she end up setting up the mental health center?
RM: Well, you know she saw a real need for it. Where her parents lived and where I grew up we were certainly within the line of sight of the Eastern State Mental Hospital. She remembered being taken there by what you&#8217;d I guess call a nanny, someone that was working to take care of the children at my grandparents&#8217; house. This nanny knew somebody that worked at the Eastern State Hospital and took her down there with her and they saw this person, but she saw a lot of other people too that were literally behind bars. So she never forgot it because she felt like they were just put away and forgotten, and to a large degree they were. There was no treatment really for serious mental illness at the time say of the First World War, which I guess for her to remember this--. She was born in 1910; it must have happened in 1914 or &#8217;15, something like that. If you had schizophrenia there just wasn&#8217;t much that could be done, and you can say that families turned their back and just put these people away. But on the other hand, families get exhausted and their resources get exhausted. So anyway, that&#8217;s where they were, was in the Eastern State Hospital, and it was largely at that point a holding place for the mentally ill rather than-. Maybe they would call it treatment but there wasn&#8217;t much that could be done, certainly not in the way we see now.
JW: So how was her center different?
RM: Well it was all outpatient. It had a few inpatient beds, but it started all outpatient. It started with children and youth and they had a psychiatrist and a psychiatric social worker, and they mostly dealt with parents and problem children and then they branched on into older patients. Then under Kennedy there was a bill that set up grants for community mental health centers, and at that point they became really defined. A community mental health center was a thing that had outpatient services, had inpatient daycare, had a few beds for inpatient treatment, mainly to stabilize people on medication. But still, they were there overnight for a couple weeks or a month or whatever, so it had all those things and that&#8217;s what her center became, a community mental health center. She helped them get the matching money to fund it and also to fund the building for it to be in. And it had a community board that she served on for years, and then there was the feeling that a younger generation-those people were all my mother&#8217;s age, the board people-that there should be a younger generation come in to that board, and I served on that board I guess for-. We had six-year terms, and I think I served three six-year terms. So I learned a lot about it. I also learned a lot about my mother because she and I would go to board meetings together. I was also involved in a furniture business at that point and sat on an advisory board for a bank, and she was as sharp as any of the board members anywhere. She knew exactly what was going on and she knew how to deal with the other people and she wasn&#8217;t the least bit shy or never backed up from anything, so I was very proud of that and saw how she operated, and I learned a lot from that, both additional respect for her and a bit about her m.o. It was a good experience.
JW: Can you tell me a little bit more about your childhood?
RM: Well, you know I don&#8217;t know-. Our family was a kind of a conflicted family because my father was one credit short of graduating from high school, in chemistry, and he never went back and got it, and mother had the master&#8217;s degree, so they were on different ground in that respect.
JW: One credit short of high school or college?
RM: High school.
JW: High school, okay.
RM: And I think that he didn&#8217;t have much respect for what she was doing with the mental health; didn&#8217;t understand it; felt somewhat threatened by it. It was competitive with his needs for a wife and how he conceived that. And they were conflicted about how to raise children. She was a very flexible, open person, and he had been raised in a family that was rigid, and he was rigid, so they couldn&#8217;t quite agree on how children should be raised. I&#8217;d have to say that I probably gave them plenty of fodder to be conflicted about [Laughs] because I was always into some thing or another. I was inclined to just go my own way and often it caught up with me. So I think they were both delighted when my brother and I could be sent off to boarding school because it just simplified their lives, and we were sent off, my brother in the ninth grade and then me a year later in the ninth grade, and graduated, both of us, from different boarding schools. Then we were prepared to go away to college, but for me, after my freshman year, I did not do well. So I came home and lived at home and went to the University of Tennessee, and that was very, very difficult for my father and for me. At the end of that year, mainly I think to get out of that conflict, but anyway I left home, got married, and lived elsewhere. The marriage turned out not to be a wise thing, but I still think leaving home was a wise thing. [Laughs]
JW: So where had you gone to boarding school?
RM: I went to three, because I&#8217;m dyslexic so that makes school hard for me. I went to Baylor School in Chattanooga and just struggled to get by there. I worked sort of hard, but I got nowhere. I passed my courses, but I got nowhere. Then I went to a tutoring school in New Jersey where I spent a year. They gave me standardized tests, and determined what my reading level and math level and other levels were. I started at those grade levels with individual teachers, and after a year there I was back up to speed and I had a great deal more self confidence than I had when I went there. That was an expensive educational opportunity, so I went on to Connecticut to a school that was not nearly as expensive, and it was a wonderful experience there. I did well and was in the student government and the things that successful prep school children do. One of my goals had been to get into Yale where my grandfather and my great-grandfather had both gone, and I got into Yale and went there and it was not for a dyslexic kid. I was over my head, and I struggled through a year but resigned the freshman class and did not go back and came to the University of Tennessee; didn&#8217;t do very well there either, so I left and went to work and worked for two or three years and then decided to go back to the university and did very well. I was kind of grown up by then.
JW: Where had you gone to school before going to boarding school?
RM: Sequoyah School, the local grammar school, and then Tyson Junior High School and then from there to boarding school, which were both public schools here in Knoxville.
JW: And had integration begun yet?
RM: No, no. Integration came while we were at the Baylor School, the Supreme Court decision came down, and you know integration didn&#8217;t follow right away. It had to be worked out and school boards get lined up and that sort of thing, but of course it did come. But the schools I was in were not integrated, and I think that was largely for economic reasons. I don&#8217;t have any feeling that black children would have been turned away, but it was an expensive tuition. But I don&#8217;t know that.
JW: So had you wanted to go to boarding school or was that something your parents made you do, or did you want to stay at home?
RM: No, I was happy to go. There again to get out of the household and be on my own was kind of a nice thing to do. So when I went to boarding school-the first one at Baylor School in Chattanooga-my brother had been there for a year, so I went there with him knowing people, and he broke the ice for me and it was an easier experience. But I had gone away to boarding camps in the summer as early as when I was maybe eight, went eight, nine, ten, and eleven, something like that, to a camp in the Smokies, and I always loved it. It was a great experience.
JW: So what was the University of Tennessee like in those years that you were there?
RM: Well-.
JW: Because you started in what year?
RM: I would think &#8217;62 or &#8217;63, and I can&#8217;t say that I really know, because I was married, very soon had a child. I had been through school before, and I was not really that interested in a college experience. I was interested in going to class, getting my work, and going home, so I didn&#8217;t stay on campus. My social life was not on campus. I was older than the kids that were in my classes for the most part. As I say, I don&#8217;t really know what was happening with the kids. I was not a part of that.
JW: So what sparked your interest in reproductive health, and maybe you can say when you became a part of the board of Planned Parenthood?
RM: I was very much interested in the environment, and still am, and I felt that population and the environment were just on a collision course, and they still are. But anyway, I went to Planned Parenthood with an interest in population and population control and not so much in the idea of women&#8217;s rights and reproductive control. That completely changed for me once I started the clinic and saw the people, saw the women, heard the counselors talk about what they were up to with these women and what their problems were and how they were resolving them and where the abortion fit into that resolution. I just came to a completely different view of it. It seemed to me that if we could handle these individual problems and give women the power to make their own decisions that we probably would not have a population problem because women don&#8217;t want any more children than they can take care of. I think increasingly women want their own lives and careers and that makes the number of children they want even fewer, in some cases none at all, in some cases one or two. But not six because you can&#8217;t do it all, and they know that. They know what they want to do, and all they need is a little help to do it, and by help I guess I really just mean freedom, people not trying to dictate to them. So I came to that rather quickly after the clinic was formed and so what I worked at and tried to have everyone there work at was being supportive, being nonjudgmental with these prospective patients and with patients, and trying to create a medical experience that really wasn&#8217;t going to require any particular healing period, wasn&#8217;t going to necessarily have any negative impact, because it doesn&#8217;t have to. If you lay on the guilt it might, but it doesn&#8217;t have to. Studies have shown that all over the country where [abortions] have been done and in other countries where they&#8217;ve been done, that there really are no negative side effects from a first trimester abortion. With repeated abortions, if they&#8217;re not done well, there&#8217;s a possibility that you create an incompetent cervix or some other medical problem, but certainly not mental illness and not breast cancer and not lots of things that are thrown out now as if they were facts. And they&#8217;re anything but facts.
JW: So what year did you join Planned Parenthood?
RM: I don&#8217;t know. I guess it was in the late &#8217;60s.
JW: So you were there for a little while before you actually started-.
RM: Oh, yes, yes. I&#8217;d been there for some time and had become increasingly with them, so I would guess maybe &#8217;65, &#8217;66, somewhere along there. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve interviewed Ruth Martin? She was the first executive director at Planned Parenthood and the first paid employee that Planned Parenthood had. So I started on the board and one of their first acts after I got there was to hire Ruth Martin part time to carry on the work as a paid employee, and I don&#8217;t know just when that was.

JW: Can you describe that board? Was it mostly people like you who were coming to it out of these environmental concerns or-?
RM: Oh, no, no. There were just a variety of people, an amazing variety of people, but all concerned, human, liberal for the most part, people.
JW: Women and men?
RM: Oh yes, yes. It was very much mixed, and I remember there was one man there-and most of these people stayed on for years, it seems like-one man that-. You know one of the things that people talked about was if birth control didn&#8217;t work there was always adoption and there was this man that had adopted two sons and had just horrible stories to tell, and he was very rigid that adoption was not the answer. Then there was a fellow that had had a vasectomy, and, my God, he thought everyone in the world should have a vasectomy.
JW: [Laughs]
RM: He thought they were wonderful, and I think he would have given the women vasectomies if he could. [Laughs] But he was a great guy and he had a used car business. I remember there was a wife of a psychologist that was so interested in people, and she had daughters who were becoming sexually aware-I don&#8217;t know whether active or not-but was very concerned that that be handled properly so that people could develop into full human beings. I guess there were two gynecologists, maybe three, that were on that board. Some of them came to meetings more than others.
JW: And was abortion something that at some point started to be discussed on the board?
RM: Well one of the activities of that chapter of Planned Parenthood came to be sending people to New York City that wanted an abortion and that could afford to make a trip to New York City, so I think that was fairly well accepted. But when it came to Planned Parenthood starting their own clinic there was a kind of a not-in-my-backyard attitude, [Laughs] you know, that you can approve of something and not want to be too closely associated with it, and that&#8217;s kind of where they came from, and there&#8217;s a lot of that still in Knox County. People can be supportive but don&#8217;t want to be openly so, don&#8217;t want to be quoted, don&#8217;t want to be seen coming and going from our clinic, and you just have to accept that as being okay. You have to take people where they are. But without pushing the development of a clinic it never would have happened because there&#8217;s so much inertia-and I was thinking about our interview coming up-and I think how I handled that was that you can&#8217;t push it because it creates resistance. But you can just lean against it and not quit leaning, and the first thing you know you&#8217;ve made a little progress.
JW: So is that how you would characterize your decision to leave the board and to help organize the clinic?
RM: Yeah. Well the opportunity opened up because this fellow, Grossman, came in and wanted to start a clinic in Knoxville and seemed to know-. I mean he knew his business because he had two other clinics and he knew how to do it, and he shared that information with me. In fact I helped him implement some of those things. They were creating an advisory board of directors for the clinic. That was part of his concept. I mean he was kind of a politician. He said he wanted people that were too busy to take an active interest because he wanted to do as he pleased. [Laughs] He wanted an advisory board that wouldn&#8217;t give advice, basically, but we got these people and they were good people. While I never used them too much, and I don&#8217;t think he intended to use them at all, it meant a lot to Dr. Mueller to have those people, he felt, behind him. We didn&#8217;t meet as a board much but I enjoyed my relationship with several of those people and they certainly were supportive of what we were trying to do.
JW: Were these other people who left the Planned Parenthood board or were they-?
RM: No, they were people from the-. We had a general surgeon; we had a couple gynecologists; we had the administrator for the regional public health. Sixteen counties are included in our public health region. Had a psychiatrist; got a minister. These were all people that had successful practices.
JW: So were these mostly men?
RM: You know, I think so. I&#8217;ve tried to think if there was-. I don&#8217;t remember a woman, but I wouldn&#8217;t say there wasn&#8217;t. And they were mostly medical. Of course we needed the support of the medical community, we needed the medical referrals.
JW: And how did the Planned Parenthood board react, since they had said Knoxville wasn&#8217;t ready for it?
RM: I think they were supportive because they could do it at arms length. They could be supportive at arms length.
JW: Was there ever a point you were in dialogue with members of the women&#8217;s movement or women&#8217;s organizations or feminists who would have been taking an interest in reproductive choice?
RM: Well I think we hired some of those people, you know, and certainly tried to be in dialogue with them, because everybody associated felt that was such an important thing and we were a part of that. We weren&#8217;t the vanguard of that for sure, but the abortion services and women&#8217;s health services are just part and parcel of the women&#8217;s movement. Women can&#8217;t be as free as they need to be without those things. But I guess I always felt that we needed to tend to our business, which was providing quality women&#8217;s healthcare, because we were controversial enough that we didn&#8217;t necessarily need to be out on picket lines. Though we had some staff members that did those things, we didn&#8217;t do them as an organization. [Pause]
JW: Oh, I know what I was going to ask. So how were your friends and family reacting [Laughs] to this move on your part to help support and then take over this clinic?
RM: Yeah, soup to nuts. My mother was very supportive; my father wished I could find something to do that was less controversial. Especially, he would always say that when there was some kind of a television interview. He would not say something negative, he would just say &#8220;I wish you could find something that was less controversial.&#8221;
JW: When you would do television interviews?
RM: Yeah, for whatever thing, and then later Bernie would do all those things. I think it was important to us to have a public face, to be the place that when something came up that involved women&#8217;s reproductive health that we could be the spokesman, that we could know the issue and know the problems and put it out there as we thought it was and as it should be. The media took advantage of that and I think it was good for us to-. And there needed to be a place like that in the community, and that&#8217;s why we were there.
JW: Were you still married when you had gotten involved?
RM: Yes, yes, I was married up until 1978. I got a divorce in 1978 and then in 1980 I married Bernie.
JW: So how was your partner at that time, how did she feel about you getting involved in this stuff?
RM: I think well-. I think yes, she was supportive of it. She may at times have been embarrassed about it, but that was her problem. We all function better when we&#8217;re around supportive people, and if she&#8217;s thrown or I&#8217;m thrown in a social situation that&#8217;s not supportive we&#8217;re uncomfortable, because in a social situation you don&#8217;t expect to have to influence people, and really you won&#8217;t influence them either. [Laughs] So I think she got in some of those situations and certainly I did too, where there were people that just thought we were killing babies and they just had to tell us. With my friends, male friends-my goodness, men are so strange-never discussed.
JW: Ever?
RM: No. [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs]
RM: I had one friend-. I mean and most of my friends are, and in fact most of east Tennessee, I think, oh, they&#8217;re such conservative Republicans, and I have one friend that is a conservative loyal Republican, but he says he wishes the party had never made an issue of abortion because it&#8217;s just none of their business. That&#8217;s the most support I&#8217;ve got, but for the most part they just do not discuss it. But then that&#8217;s the way these men are. I eat lunch with a group of men every Monday, one of them missed a week, and the next week he died of cancer. He never told anybody he was sick.
JW: Oh my gosh.
RM: Yeah. That&#8217;s just-. One of them divorced his wife. He never told anybody. We found out when he remarried. [Laughs] So men are kind of closed about things other than sports. [Laughs]
JW: [Laughs] Well, so how has it affected you to have worked in an environment where there were a lot of women and people who were feminists and who probably acted a little bit differently than this group of men?
RM: Yes, they do, and I&#8217;m just a feminist, and with those other people I&#8217;m just a closet liberal. Yeah, but it&#8217;s affected me. I&#8217;m a different person because of it, but none of them give a damn. They don&#8217;t care what I&#8217;m like. [Laughs] They care about their stuff. It&#8217;s strange, but they&#8217;re not deep people.
JW: So when you started the clinic, who did you think would be the women who would go there? Was there some idea of who would be using the services?
RM: Well I thought there would be many more [University of Tennessee] students than there turned out to be. Yes, I was quite surprised at the diversity of patients in age, in ethnicity, in geography, probably more than half from outside of Knox County, from all surrounding places. We used to keep statistics on where people came from and how old they were and that sort of thing, but I don&#8217;t remember those. Bernie probably knows those statistics. When I retired I let it all go. I just don&#8217;t keep up with those things anymore.
JW: But it&#8217;s still [acting as] a regional service.
RM: Yes, it certainly has, which is great.
JW: Were there any big surprises in those first couple of years?
RM: Well, you know we got off to a very slow start and that was kind of a surprise because it was awfully difficult to make ends meet, and I kept putting money in and putting money in, and I just hoped it would turn around. And it finally did, but it was scary. So I guess that was a kind of a surprise. It shouldn&#8217;t necessarily have been.
JW: Has your understanding of reproductive choice or women&#8217;s rights changed over the years?
RM: Not really. I was a great fan of the Supreme Court &#8217;73 decision, and I couldn&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve read that decision, but I felt they had it very much right about a woman&#8217;s right to privacy, you know? So if you start out that a woman has the right to privacy and it&#8217;s nobody else&#8217;s business, you can&#8217;t loosen up much from there. So that&#8217;s the way I felt about it. We&#8217;ve had an awful lot of threats to that, people that think, yeah, but what about this or what about that. To me it&#8217;s just too simple. It&#8217;s nobody else&#8217;s business, that that woman should be able to make that decision about her life and nobody else should be involved, so I felt that way in &#8217;73, in &#8217;74, and in 2011 I feel that way, so that certainly has been a constant for me.
JW: What other community organizations have you been involved in?
RM: I think that&#8217;s-. Well, no, I was involved with the Sierra Club and Trout Unlimited Club and a bunch of those environmental kind of things early on, and of course the mental health center and Planned Parenthood. I can&#8217;t think of others.
JW: That&#8217;s more than the average person. [Laughs]
RM: Well, you know what I was going to say, I have done all those things and I feel like I&#8217;m not a joiner, you know, because I don&#8217;t enjoy meetings and I don&#8217;t care too much about joining organizations. [Laughs] And yet I have done those things without ever becoming a joiner.
JW: What year did you retire as director of the center?
RM: I would think it was, oh,&#8217;87, &#8217;86, somewhere along there, and of course Bernie took over my job and we were still both very much interested. But she was doing the work, so I took most of a year and sat at the dining room table and designed this house and then spent the next year down here with carpenters and framers and stucco men and whatever and built this house. So that took me completely away from the clinic and got me involved in something else that I found just very rewarding. I loved it and got lots of exercise.
JW: So one story that we haven&#8217;t touched on yet is the Margaret Sanger story.
RM: Well, and see I don&#8217;t know much about that story. I just know that it happened, and I know that it happened because my mother told me that it happened.
JW: So what did your mother tell you?
RM: Well, that Margaret Sanger had come to Knoxville, and I think met with my grandmother because I guess she was-. Well I don&#8217;t know whether she was setting up or interested in starting the chapter here at that point or not, but anyway they probably had a cocktail party for her and had a dinner for her at their home and so, you know, that happened. She was there. In the &#8217;20s they were pretty socially active people. I know that Clarence Darrow was down for the Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, and he spent a night with them and similar entertainment and that sort of thing, that largely probably set up by my uncle who at that time covered the story of that trial for the Knoxville Journal. So he probably got to know him and got him to come up and be with all of them. I don&#8217;t know if you ever read anything about him. I&#8217;ve read several biographies of him. He was a wonderful liberal person for that period, just a very human person, and of course Sanger was too. I&#8217;m sure she would have been quite a person to meet.
JW: So did you know your grandmother very well, like did she live long enough to see you-  RM: Oh, yes.  JW: -do these things?  RM: Yes. I didn&#8217;t know her as well as my older brother did, they shared more interests in common, but I think my interest in the environment came from her. She was a gardener and an environmentalist. Oh, she&#8217;d carry on about organic gardening and maintaining the fertility of the earth and the forest. All those things I just swallowed up and thought were wonderful, and still do, and I think Bernie&#8217;s interest in gardening has been helped by her in that I&#8217;ve helped Bernie with her gardening. I don&#8217;t do the work but I prepare all the stuff.  JW: Then how did your grandmother feel about the clinic?  RM: I think she was dead by then.  JW: Okay.  RM: Yeah, I think she was, and if she wasn&#8217;t-but I think she was. She had a long period of unawareness before she died which, you know. Death with dignity is a thing we don&#8217;t understand a lot about yet. We support people in living much longer than they can live, and she was a victim of that. She was in a nursing home for years, and my mother was as well. These kind of interviews were used, though it was a political [1:02:14 move], but it&#8217;s still very interesting and you can get out of these interviews a lot that&#8217;s never been written down and never would be. People don&#8217;t think to write it down, and frankly we&#8217;ve gotten too lazy to write. We use computers and we use televisions and we don&#8217;t record as much as we used to, and I grieve over it. But I&#8217;m as guilty as the next. I don&#8217;t write my stuff down like I should.  JW: I just thought of one other question. So you were never in the service?  RM: No, my marriage precluded that.  JW: Okay.  RM: Yeah, and I&#8217;ve often told people that if I had it to do over again that was one of the big mistakes I made. I should have left home and joined the service instead of leaving home and marrying because I just was not-. I was awfully smart at nineteen, I thought, but I needed so much to grow up and to have more experience, and I should have done that but I didn&#8217;t.  JW: Okay, well I thought at the last second that I was curious about that. Anything else?  RM: Not that I know of.  JW: Okay. Well, thank you.  RM: Good interview, and I&#8217;ll try to get you a history together that&#8217;s-.
