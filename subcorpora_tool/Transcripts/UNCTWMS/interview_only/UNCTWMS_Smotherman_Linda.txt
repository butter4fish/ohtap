Evangeline Mee: Ok, this is Evangeline Mee, and I am here with Linda Smotherman at her home in Spencer, Tennessee, on May 31, 2012. So I guess if we could just start off, if we could just talk a little about your childhood background and where you&#8217;re from.  Linda Smotherman: Ok. I&#8217;m originally from Van Buren County. And my parents were factory workers and farmers. And I had a brother, and both sets of grandparents. And great-grandparents until I was about eight--lost two of my great-grandmothers. And my great-grandfather lived till I was twenty years old. And we still have the family farm that was dated as far back as 1888. And it is in the Piney community, Van Buren County. And my father was borned there on that farm, and my mother was born in Warren County.   And then I went to school at the Piney School till I was in the fourth grade, and then they did a combining the schools to two different community school. And it was Pineland. And I went from fifth grade to the eighth grade there, and then to Van Buren County High School in Spencer. And I graduated in 1968, and I went from high school to college at Middle Tennessee State University [MTSU] in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. And that&#8217;s where I met my husband, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. So we got married in 1972, and I went to Medical Laboratory School there at the hospital in Murfreesboro. I started in &#8217;71 and finished in &#8217;72.   And we moved back to Van Buren County after I graduated from Lab School, and I went to work for River Park Hospital in McMinnville, Tennessee. And I worked there from 1973 to 1978. And then I went to work for a private practice doctor&#8217;s office. And that&#8217;s about the time I became involved with SOCM [Save Our Cumberland Mountains] while I was &#8211; shortly after I left River Park. Well, actually, I was involved with them prior to that with the Concerned Citizens of Piney. But shortly after I left the hospital, I became president of SOCM for about a year to two years &#8211; somewhere between that time. And it demanded so much of my time that I -- with working and home and &#8211; I just didn&#8217;t feel like I could continue the pace that I was going. So when it come election time, I declined to hold office any longer.   EM: So did you &#8211; what kind of first brought you to SOCM?  LS: The fact that Amax Coal Company was planning on a large strip-mining operation. And it would have destroyed our community and because of the long family history in the community, you know, the fact that we still had the family farm; we definitely didn&#8217;t want it destroyed. And my great-grandfather had started what had started to be a family cemetery, which was in the heart of the, you know, Piney Community. And that&#8217;s where he was buried, and I didn&#8217;t want--. You know, we didn&#8217;t want our cemetery--. We didn&#8217;t want our family farm tore up. And the only way to do that was by whatever means we could come up with to keep them from coming and so we chose the avenue of--. They had to have a water quality permit, and we chose that avenue to see if we could get them to deny the permit.   EM: What would the coal mining company have done physically to the landscape?  LS: Oh, they was bringing a dragline that took out tons of dirt at one time. And they would--. Just started taking out, removing everything and putting it on spoil piles, so they got way down to the Sewanee coal seam, which is what they&#8212;[Interruption]. Which is what they was after. Because it&#8217;s high quality coal. But it&#8217;s real deep. And so that was their purpose: was to get down to the big --. I mean, take off all the dirt till they got down to that coal seam. And they just keep moving up and doing it and doing it till they took out all the coal seam, which if they took out all the coal seam, they took out nearly all the community too.   EM: And how did you know that this was in the works? Just because you saw the trucks come through?  LS: No, we had heard talking about, you know--. They were wanting to get the land form out of state landholder that had been here for years. And they was leasing all this land, and they made it clear this is what their intent was. And the first community meeting that we had, they was representatives there from Amax. You know, telling them what their intent was. And then there was the two organizers that was with SOCM at the time. And we heard what Amax said, and then we heard what the organizers said and decided what Amax was saying wasn&#8217;t all that they intended to do. And of course we knew what their history was in other states and the kind of equipment that they used and the amount of blasting and everything that they would have done.   EM: So you had kind of heard the damage that had been done in other states.  LS: In fact, my mom and dad went with Maureen and a couple other people up to Illinois to see some of their sites and what they had done. And there was this one place that they went to, that it just like--. They went around; they just left the cemetery on the teeny knoll where they just mined all the way around it.    EM: So what was the name of the group that you were involved with before you joined with SOCM?  LS: Concerned Citizens of Piney.  EM: Okay. And was that formed because of this?  LS: Yes, it was. The first meeting was just kind of--. It was just--. Somebody had called a community meeting. It wasn&#8217;t anything, anybody, any name to it. Just a community meeting to say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been hearing these rumors and we want to know. You know, is this true, how much of it&#8217;s true. You know, what&#8217;s your plans, where you going to do, where you going to do it at?&#8221; That kind of thing.  EM: And who led that meeting?  LS: Well, I don&#8217;t know for sure if you can say they led it or not, but Maureen and Boomer. I think they first got up and said, you know, what they knew and had heard. And then I think the Amax representatives got up and said what they--what their tale was. And then our state representative, he got up and made a statement. And of course then a lot of people in the community went and asked him questions and of Amax and of Maureen. And I think maybe the asked the representative, you know, things that--in regard to what he knew, and what they could do and would do.  EM: And so there were already SOCM representatives at that meeting or after that?  LS: No, they came to that meeting, and I--if I&#8217;m not mistaken--they&#8217;re the one that called for a community meeting. Which at that point they wasn&#8217;t no chapter down in this area, they were all up in Scott and Campbell County.   EM: So then it was--. So after the meeting, that&#8217;s when joined forces with SOCM and what happened there?  LS: Well, we maintained a Concerned Citizens of Piney. But then like myself, my mother, my dad, Louis Macdowell, and different ones became members of SOCM. And when we became members, it just kind of kept easing down this way and we got organizers down here working a whole lot of the time. And then my mom became one of the organizers later on. It was like two organizations working together, but it was the same people doing the work.  EM: For the same cause.  LS: For the same cause, yeah.   EM: And what role did your dad have?  LS: To begin with, he was president, I think, of Concerned Citizens of Piney. And right now off the top of my head, I can&#8217;t remember who was vice-chairperson. I started out as the secretary, and then in a little while then I moved up to the chair position. And, of course, then I became more involved with SOCM all the time.   And at that time, the way SOCM was organized is not how&#8217;s it&#8217;s organized today. They had monthly meetings; they had it in a different community each time. Whoever wanted to showed up; whatever decision making was taking place, everybody at that meeting voted on it. So it involved a lot of traveling around. But I continued to do that. And about 1980 &#8211; somewhere along in there &#8211; I became president. And I was still doing that meeting, and I attended all the meetings. And it was at different locations, and a lot of times it was in different time zones. And I was trying--. I was working full time,   EM: So what kind of attracted you to take on leadership roles in SOCM?  LS: Well, I don&#8217;t know that I called it an attraction. It was just, in order for it to stop, somebody had to do something. And a lot of people was, &#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t want it. Yeah, I&#8217;d like to see it stopped.&#8221; But nobody was willing to work. And I wasn&#8217;t willing to set around and not have it stop, so I just stepped up and done whatever I could do.   EM: And what kind of specific issues did ya&#8217;ll work on while you were president? What were the successes or hard things?  LS: Well, we got someone in Congress to introduce a bill, a Surface Rights Amendments, that give the people that just own the surface and just not the minerals the right to say whether or not somebody could come onto your land. So that occupied a whole lot of time. And also at that same time is when SOCM decided that the way they was organized wasn&#8217;t going to work for a long-term organization. Because the monthly meetings--how we was going to different places-- just whoever showed up was whoever showed up and voted. And they come up with the idea of a board and chapters and each chapter would send a representative to the board. And so that was a whole, long, drawn-out process of changing from how it originally was to that. And we had lots and lots of meeting. And lots and lots of discussion [laughter].   JW had been president ahead of me, and then Betty Ford had been after him. So it&#8217;s Betty in between me and him. And JW&#8217;s very opinionated as to how it needed to happen. So we had different views on things, and we&#8217;d have to go and chat about it [laughter] and come back. But that was a pretty long, drawn-out process to actually to get that form of organization of which we did. And of course starting out, there wasn&#8217;t that many chapters. And then it just kept growing, and as it growed, you&#8217;d form another chapter. And that&#8217;s still how it&#8217;s done. And of course I was the board representative multiple times. And I was at large representative a time or two.   EM: So after the first initial--what was the name of coal company again that you mentioned?  LS: Amax.   EM: Amax. How did that suit end up? That struggle with Amax?  LS: The state testing water quality board denied their permit. And after they didn&#8217;t get that, they just decided it was just more than they wanted to fool with. They decided it wasn&#8217;t productive enough for them, I guess, with all the opposition they had had. So they decided not to, but then they kept selling off their lease. So eventually we got strip mining in that same area, but not to the extent that they was planning to do. But it still--. Massive, massive amount.   EM: And can you talk about that, what ended up happening with the strip mining that still came through?  LS: Well, they of course clear-cut, and they stripped, and they just--. They had to reclaim it more than it used to be. And they did just barely enough to leave, and then it had to get a reclaim some more, so they couldn&#8217;t get their bond released till they reclaimed it suitable. So they lost their bond money because it&#8217;s not being--maybe four years ago somebody come in and did it so they could get their bond released. But now that company--and it changed hands, and I don&#8217;t know all the names--it was Skyline Coal Company. And I think they eventually had some financial issues and sold off parts of their company. But some other company is who got the bond money because they had come in and done the reclaiming of that--. They could get the bond released.   EM: What was the reaction in the community to--.  LS: To Skyline?  EM: Yeah and to--.  LS: Oh.   EM: Ya&#8217;ll&#8217;s group--.  LS: Yeah, it was like some people loved us, and a lot of people didn&#8217;t like us at all. And a lot of people, they might of liked us but they didn&#8217;t want it out because it affected their jobs in various ways. Or they felt like it would. And a lot of people just thought we was troublemakers. And a lot of people thought, by us working to deny for them to get their water quality permit, that we was killing off jobs. Because they [coal companies] was telling all, &#8220;We&#8217;re going have, oh, this huge amount of people that we&#8217;re going to employ. We&#8217;re going to pay a large wages.&#8221; And a lot of people thought that&#8217;s what we was doing: we was killing off possibility for a job.   EM: So was there any retaliation from the community?  LS: I don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;d say retaliation, but they didn&#8217;t like us, and every time something would come up, they&#8217;d all say, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s that same bunch that&#8217;s causing trouble.&#8221; And that was always the--. A lot of people looked at it like that, like we was the people causing trouble.  EM: So was it hard to get support? I mean, were there enough people that wanted to stand ya&#8217;ll that it wasn&#8217;t--?  LS: No, it&#8217;s hard to get support. Like I say, cause a lot of them thought, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;ll look bad; against my job.&#8221; Yeah, and you could go out into the community, you couldn&#8217;t get a lot of people to come to a meeting or--. And it was the same--. It&#8217;s the same--. It was the same people whatever come up. The same people did the work, and it turned out like I say. Anywhere from twelve to twenty-five people.  EM: What did it take to get people to come out for the meetings?  LS: Well, like I say, the first two or three it was a large group because I think for a curiosity factor then. But you could hardly get other than that core group of, like I say, twelve to twenty-five to come. Because they didn&#8217;t--. For one thing, they didn&#8217;t want people to say, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re part of that troublemakers!&#8221;   EM: That&#8217;s hard. Once you guys started organizing and raising awareness about what the coal mining company was going to do, did you guys experience any intimidation from the coal mining company or was their any kind of relationship there? Or do you think they knew what ya&#8217;ll were doing?  LS: They probably knew, and they might have would have liked to intimidate us. But it didn&#8217;t work. Because we had strong opinions about it. I mean, they was nice enough like at the hearings: you&#8217;d meet them in the hallways. You speak to them; they speak to you. But then we had a lot of other people backing us, because the water quality--. A lot of the water quality people was on our side; they knew what it was going to do. They knew what they were saying wasn&#8217;t going to work. And they wasn&#8217;t going do all that they said they would to prevent the pollution. So we had a lot of those kind of people on our side. And like TWRA, they knew what it do, and a lot of them was on our side. So we had support from that kind of people. But not people right in the community who felt like, &#8220;You taking away my possibility for a job.&#8221;  EM: So I guess, kind of shifting gears a little bit, could you talk at all about why there was such strong women&#8217;s leadership in SOCM? It just seem like &#8211; I&#8217;ve just heard this reoccurring theme of the women in SOCM just being fiery forces and that being something that&#8217;s really special and unique about the organization. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that at all.  LS: Well, just like how I got more involved all the time was, like I said, people: they like something done but they didn&#8217;t want to do it. And a lot of the women wanted it done, and they was willing to do the work. And they was real opinionated about it. And I think that&#8217;s is how it came about. It wasn&#8217;t necessarily--. They didn&#8217;t have some idea of like, &#8220;I want to be this, or I want to be that. I want this done. I want this stopped. I want--.&#8221; You know. &#8220;And it order to get it done, let&#8217;s do it. I got to get it done. Get on with it.&#8221; And I think that&#8217;s how most of them, you know, like Betty Anderson and Carol Ford and Barbara Levi. Laura--. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s Laura&#8217;s last name? Well, I cant remember her last name right, but--. And it wasn&#8217;t necessarily like they had any ideas like, &#8220;I want to do this because that just looks cool.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;I just was it done.&#8221;  EM: What were some of the hard things throughout your time with the organization? Like did the organization always run smoothly in your experience with it?  LS: Well, when they come up with the concept of making the organization operate like a lot of them do with board and board members, that was so different from what the original group did, and what they intended it to be. And it to them it seemed more like a lot of other groups that was--. That it looked cool to be like, you know--. Like Sierra Club, like it&#8217;s a great, big, nation-wide thing? And I think, to a lot of the original ones, they didn&#8217;t want to be that. They wanted to be their little community organization like they started out to be. And so that whole concept of--. That was difficult. I say it took lots of meetings and a lot of working through to get people to have their feelings hurt or feel like they lost what it started out to be. Especially the older ones, because a lot of it begin with the ones that started off were elderly people to begin with that was out there doing a lot of the work in the beginning. That was a little different, a little getting used to.  And then a lot of people just didn&#8217;t want to see it keep spreading out across the state. They wanted to keep it mainly up in the coalfields, and so that was kind of a rough--. To get it spread out across the state. A lot of the original members didn&#8217;t want to do that either. But overall, it has run pretty smooth considering the time. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s--. It&#8217;s not been that bad,   EM: That&#8217;s good. And SOCM does more than just strip-mining activism, right?  LS: Yes, they do a lot of stuff now. And that&#8217;s been a little different too. Because for my own self, it was all about the environment then. And to me that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s still--. That&#8217;s what I think of it still. But yeah, they&#8217;ve worked on a lot of stuff. We&#8217;ve worked on against landfill. We&#8217;ve stopped a landfill here in our community.  EM: Really. What happened with that?  LS: Same thing: water quality. What they were talking about doing couldn&#8217;t possibly happen where they were talking about doing it. Because they were talking about how they were going to do all of this liner and how it wasn&#8217;t going to let pollution out. And it couldn&#8217;t be done. Because they were going to do it in a swamp, swampland anyway kind of. That was a whole other issue. You can&#8217;t do away wetlands. They were going to have to relocate some more wetlands. And it wouldn&#8217;t just going to be from us. They were going to bring it from out of state, some of the waste. But we stopped that.  There was going to come a--. The National Guard was going to put a base here at the old base from World War II. So we stopped that.  EM: What would that have done?  LS: It would have took up that large portion of the county acreage like same as the coal mine would have done. It was [29:05] is the same vicinity. And it would have done the same thing. It would have took out part of [29:10]. That was just kind of--. I don&#8217;t know where that fly by night idea come from to start with! [laughter]. The guy that was the commander in Tennessee, I think he got the idea to start with. I don&#8217;t even know why, but once that was, said, &#8220;No that ain&#8217;t going to happen.&#8221; Then there&#8217;s not even anything been mentioned about a National Guard base.  EM:  Seems like such a constant onslaught of things wanting to--.  LS: Yeah, well, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;ve always said: &#8220;If they had something bad they wanted to put somewhere, they&#8217;d put it out in our community!&#8221; But they didn&#8217;t want us to have no good thing; no stuff that would create a nice jobs for people. Or something that would bring us in water, which is a issue for our county. We don&#8217;t have adequate water, adequate city water for expansion as far as housing and stuff. We&#8217;ve got a lot of housing developments now, and they can&#8217;t get water. They have to have a well dug.  So you know, if somebody say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get water; let&#8217;s get sewer; let&#8217;s get--.&#8221; No. but they don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t want to bring us good stuff like that. [Laughter]. They want to bring PCB incinerators and garbage dumps and mining [laugh]. Crazy stuff.  EM: Yeah. Which is amazing because--.  LS: In our little community we already have four landfills! I think four landfills has already been located in our community.   EM: Wow. From what city sources?  LS: Just our--. Well, it was supposed to be just our county, but the one--. And it was supposed to have a long life, and it had a very short life, because they was letting out of county people bring--. And they wouldn&#8217;t pay! They was just bringing it and dumping it! And they didn&#8217;t pay! So now, we don&#8217;t have any and we pay eleven cents a pound, and it&#8217;s shipped off to some place else for our own county use. Which we have a nice recycling center, and it&#8217;s utilized well.  EM: It&#8217;s amazing to hear that because, like when I&#8217;m driving through, you pass so many state parks. And so it&#8217;s obviously a beautiful place with so much preserved land, and yet at the time there&#8217;s all these--. People want to use it for landfills, and--.  LS: And it would have all affected out state park. And we go that declared unsuitable for mining, SOCM did, because they actually was going to--. Skyline was going to creep that way with it!   Mr. Smotherman: Amax, honey.  LS: Well, Skyline too! But Amax would have took out a whole bunch of--. And there was something that come up last year or year before last that they might try to lift that unsuitable for mining, but I hadn&#8217;t heard anything else said about it. So apparently they decided that that wasn&#8217;t going to be a good idea.  EM: So what did you do after SOCM? When you stepped down as president, idd you stay involved?  LS: Yeah, I did. I did. I was on the board in 2005, I guess. I graduated from Tennessee Tech in 2006. I went back to college after my daughter graduated high school. And I was on the board a lot of time I was going up to Tennessee Tech. So 2005, I think, must have been the last time I was on the board. And I had--. I stayed involved.   EM: What do you see as some of the current issues &#8211; either that SOCM has tackled or current issues in the community that you see?  LS: Well, I haven&#8217;t been active in the last about four or five years, so I&#8217;ve not attended any board meetings. I don&#8217;t really know--. I know the office moved into Knoxville. Of course, they&#8217;ve got one down in west Tennessee. So I really, I don&#8217;t know a whole lot about right now. Except mountain top removal, and that&#8217;s not just a SOCM issue, it&#8217;s a issue for a lot of other people. Which I&#8217;d really like to see that stopped. Because it&#8217;s just totally insane. And even different groups I had &#8211; one of the classes I was in. Once a younger student came into the class I was in, talking about mountain top removal, up there at Tennessee Tech. and I think it&#8217;s a big issue, and I think it&#8217;s continue to be one until someone takes a stand and says, &#8220;No, this is insane. We&#8217;re going to make a law against that.&#8221;  EM: And yet, it&#8217;s kind of the same thing that you encountered: there&#8217;s so many communities that support it &#8211; or are okay with it &#8211; just because they think it brings jobs.  LS: That&#8217;s just it because they&#8217;ve got no way to make a living, and they think that&#8217;s their only way. And these companies use that. They use that. They build that up: how great we&#8217;re going to be; how much money we&#8217;re going to bring to the community. Which is exactly what Amax did all those years ago.   MS: And we&#8217;ve got a lot more populated too in the last twenty years.  LS: Yes.  MS: There&#8217;s been the storms down in Florida and Mississippi, and there&#8217;s been a world of people moved from down there to up here.   LS: And for this community, in our county, water is going to be even more an issue than it is right now. Course where you&#8217;re seeing so much dry weather? And the way we get our water, it&#8217;s going to be less of it all the time. And we can&#8217;t get anything until we get water to support more business. We can get sewers to support business. We need that. And we can&#8217;t. And for me that would be the issue if I had the time to do it. It would be trying to figure out a way to get us some water.   But I mean, the people where mountain top removal is going on, right now they&#8217;re seeing job. They wont see down the road: &#8220;We don&#8217;t have that water.&#8221; Cause it&#8217;s been ruined and destroyed; it&#8217;s filled in! It&#8217;s gone! But right now what they can see is, &#8220;Yeah, I got a paycheck coming in.&#8221; And if they was--. If our economy wasn&#8217;t such that they could get a job, a different job, a lot of them might now have that kind of job. If you ain&#8217;t got any kind of a job, that looks pretty good.   EM: Even if it&#8217;s taking away where you live.   LS: Yeah. It&#8217;s like that old saying, &#8220;Some people can&#8217;t see the forest for the trees.&#8221; Can&#8217;t see through the trees.   EM: Well, I&#8217;m trying to--. Can you think of just of any stories that I wouldn&#8217;t know to ask about that you think would be good to share or anything like that?  LS: Not right off the top of my head [laughter].   EM: [Laughter] Not without a memory trigger.  LS: Yeah.  EM: Or what, I mean, is there--. Can you talk about going up and having meetings at Highlander some? I know you mentioned that before.   LS: Yeah, like I say, a lot of times we moved around for meetings. But we always had an annual meeting where we would get together, and we would set goals for the next year, the enxt five years. And a lot of people came that time that maybe didn&#8217;t come to the monthly meetings all the time. You&#8217;d get a whole bunch of first people in a place, they got, you know--. Come up with pretty good ideas when you sift them all down. And it was interesting meeting all the different people. Just like back when the Concerned Citizens of Piney was meeting. They would go back to my house for coffee. And you&#8217;d have all these different peoples from--. You know, that would have never accidentally run into each other otherwise. We&#8217;d have--. One night, we had--I don&#8217;t know what--thirty people at our house after a meeting for coffee, you know. And we had water quality people, and we had real wealthy lady from over on Lookout Mountain, and we had Jesuit priests, and we had TWRA people, and--. We just--. A whole diverse people, you know. And they got different ideas! Than what you--. If you&#8217;re working beside the same person all the time, your ideas may be similar, but you get that many diverse people from different walks of life together, you get a different set of ideas.   EM: For sure.  LS: And it was real interesting to meet people from, you know, real different walks of life.   EM: Carol Ford was saying that SOCM taught leadership too?  LS: Yeah, it really encouraged it. And of course, at the time that Amax was here, and iw as going to all these places, speaking to all these people, I didn&#8217;t know about speaking to nobody! [Laughter] You go somewhere and you think, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s going to be twenty people.&#8221; And then they&#8217;d be two hundred people that would show up. but you learn a lot of things when you have to push yourself to do things you think you can&#8217;t do in order for the good end results. And they do--. They encourage that. They encourage people to do that and to become leaders.  But I know I went, and I spoke to the League of Women Voters. And we went on TV to a Meet the Press thing, and went to Washington D.C. to meet with the EPA. When over to the University of South to talk to some group, and I forgot what that was now, but--. They encouraged that.   MS: Sierra Club.  LS: Yeah, I went and spoke to the Sierra Club.  MS: Chattanooga.  LS: But they push you to do things that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise do.   EM: Well, I guess is there anything that you&#8217;d want to add?  LS: Not right off the top of my head.  EM: Well, I suppose we can pause this. Thank you so much for telling some stories!  LS: You&#8217;re welcome!
