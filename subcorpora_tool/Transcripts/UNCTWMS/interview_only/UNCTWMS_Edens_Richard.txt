Evan Faulkenbury: Today is July 31, 2013. My name is Evan Faulkenbury with the SOHP. Today I&#8217;m interviewing Pastor Richard Edens of the United Church of Chapel Hill in his office in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. First, thank you for agreeing to sit and be interviewed. The first question I have is to tell a bit about your birth and childhood and that sort of thing.
Richard Edens: Okay. Well, I grew up in the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, born in 1952. I did not know my maternal grandparents. They died either before I was born or right after I was born. But my paternal grandparents had a small tobacco and cotton farm in Rowland, North Carolina, which is on the north side of South of the Border.
EF: Okay. [Laughs]
RE: It&#8217;s down in Robeson County. I would spend summers down with them, so I had a great experience being on that farm in those early years, but most of my growing up was clearly in the suburbs of Charlotte. I&#8217;m one of the few people my age that can say that I worked with mules, so that was from that farm experience.
EF: So tell me a bit about the schools you went to in Charlotte and your educational experience coming of age in Charlotte.
RE: I went to Cotswold Elementary and then over to Montclaire Elementary as our family moved from one side of town to the other. I went to Smith Junior High, and then right as I was graduating from that, instead of going to South Mecklenburg, which is where I would have been slated to go, my family moved to the east side of town. I ended up going to East Mecklenburg, so my growing up was there. From high school I went on to Wofford College, a little Methodist school in Spartanburg, South Carolina. I spent one year out at the University of Arizona, thinking I might be a geologist, and then I came back and finished my college degree at Wofford College, and from there went to Yale Divinity School.
EF: Okay. Well talk a bit about what made you want to go to divinity school, the inspiration for that, and what led you to Yale.
RE: Being in school in the early 1970s was a time of great unrest, turmoil, as people, at least male students, were struggling with what the draft might mean for them, the Vietnam era. The first Earth Day had just taken place in 1970. There were a lot of things happening on campus, and I found that the people that were really asking those kinds of questions and giving you space to talk about it and think about it. The campus ministers or clusters of people [often] gathered in this kind of religious conversation. So over time I started going, &#8220;Gosh, this might be interesting.&#8221; So I started taking religion courses while I was at Wofford College, and one of the professors there had been at Yale Divinity School and he spoke fondly of it. So actually there were several of us in my class that went from Wofford College up to New Haven.
EF: And what year was that that you went to Yale?
RE: I entered Yale in 1974.
EF: Okay. Well talk a bit about Yale, your time there and your experiences.
RE: Well, like for many people, most of my experience had been in the South, so it was just a wonderful time to go and to see a world outside of the South and to engage that, and then also students coming from all over the country to that particular school. But I think, also, the experience of most graduate students is suddenly you&#8217;re surrounded with people with like interest. And so there&#8217;s certainly a blossoming that takes place as a graduate student in any program when you find that you&#8217;re no longer the one person, but suddenly you&#8217;ve got dozens of people around you that share your interest. It was an exciting time.
EF: Right. And the kind of religious instruction at Yale; was it similar to or different denominationally from your childhood or adolescence?
RE: Well, one, I would say it was certainly mainline ecumenical, so it wasn&#8217;t denominationally specific but certainly it would have been in the heritage of that sort of mainline progressive or liberal theological tradition. I think all religion students or theological students, people training for the ministry, probably go through at some point, either in college or in seminary, this time of really letting go of some of the things that one had in their childhood faith and re-appropriating or reimagining what it means for an adult faith. So I think that&#8217;s part of the intensity of any graduate program but particularly with religious studies. You&#8217;re having to reinterpret your personal faith, and it&#8217;s exciting at times, so that was certainly there. I mean, Yale was an exciting place to be when we were there, strong professors. William Sloane Coffin was the chaplain to the university at that point in time. There was a lot of excitement around campus.
EF: So while you were at Yale, what did you want to do after that? What were you inspired to do while at Yale?
RE: Well, actually, I went to Yale initially thinking that I was going to continue on to teach. I saw seminary as a three-year time and then I would probably go to graduate school and teach. One of the things I did, like many students at seminary, I went and was a part of a local church as an intern. That was instructive, and I would say it was instructive enough that initially I thought, &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll stay on my path to teach.&#8221; [Laughs] Then I took a year out and explored being campus minister at the University of Illinois. I was campus minister for the United Church of Christ on the campus of the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, and one of my learnings out of that is I found myself really enjoying the conversations I had with the faculty and the staff and the members of the congregation that housed the ministry, perhaps more so than the conversations with the students. I mean they were certainly rewarding, but I found myself really drawn to the interactions I was having with the other members of the congregation, so it made me rethink about whether I should reconsider going into the parish. Then I had the opportunity my last year at Yale to be one of the interns at Battell Chapel, which is the chapel for Yale University, and so that was another opportunity to be in that university chapel setting. I found myself drawn to working in a university setting and I really enjoyed the parish work, you might say.
EF: Right. So you graduated Yale in 1977, or 1978?
RE: 1978, because I had taken the year out.
EF: Oh, right, at Illinois, okay.
RE: Now meanwhile, Jill, my wife, she had also gotten there and she took a year out and was serving at a church. At that point we didn&#8217;t know each other, but she had served in a church in Cleveland, Ohio, also during a time of discernment, so we both came back to Yale as essentially fourth-year students. I mean, we were both completing our third year really after being there for four years, taking the year out. We got thrown together at that point and of course discovered that we had fallen in love and were ready to go out together into the world. So we became one of those early clergy couples. [Laughs]
EF: [Laughs] Well, talk about that, becoming a clergy couple and then on into your first job, I suppose.
RE: Well, part of the discernment as young seminary students, there&#8217;s certainly the attraction of having someone who understands you and knows you and understands the life you&#8217;re getting ready to go into, so that&#8217;s certainly a part of the attraction. But as we came out, interestingly, being in New Haven I had found myself attracted to the United Church of Christ [UCC]. Because of the Congregational heritage of the New England area--Puritans, Pilgrims, Mayflower--there were many more UCC churches in that area. I have to say, growing up in Charlotte I did not know the United Church of Christ. My church world was basically Methodist, which is what I was, or Baptist, or Presbyterian, and that was the totality of my Southern church world. [Laughs] There were a few Pentecostals somewhere and a few other names, but basically most everyone was either Methodist, Baptist, or Presbyterian, so that says something about being from North Carolina.         But there I got involved with the Congregational church, or the United Church of Christ, and as I said, I ended up serving as the campus chaplain for the UCC. Jill had a similar journey in that she came to New Haven as a Methodist but had served in a UCC setting--back in Cleveland she served a UCC church there--and we both had come back to that last year thinking that we might, individually, be exploring moving into the United Church of Christ. But as we came together as a couple, one of the tensions that came up is [that in the] United Church of Christ the tradition is for churches to call their own pastors, sort of a free call system, you might say, and here we were as a clergy couple. What&#8217;s the likelihood of finding two churches nearby that would both be looking to call someone at the same time? So we looked at that and said, &#8220;This seems a bit too complicated for us, so maybe we ought to return to our Methodist roots and let the bishop worry about that.&#8221; So that&#8217;s what we decided to do. We came to North Carolina to meet with my bishop, Bishop Allen at the time, and he would not interview Jill.
EF: Really?
RE: He said he had four clergy couples and four were enough for any bishop, so if she wanted to come in as a director of Christian education, he would be glad to meet with her, but otherwise he didn&#8217;t see that he had the time.
EF: Wow.

RE: So we weren&#8217;t sure what to do at that point in time.  So the bishop from Wisconsin came out to Yale Divinity School and he was recruiting people. He had promised that he would find a place for the two of us, so we said, &#8220;Okay. We&#8217;ll go to Wisconsin,&#8221; even though Jill was from Ohio and I had served one year in Illinois. Part of being part of a Methodist conference is that you&#8217;re always in that conference and we would then be spending our whole life in Wisconsin, and because we didn&#8217;t have family there, it wasn&#8217;t our cultural home. One of the things we discerned out of that first year is that Wisconsin was not going to be home, so we then decided to move. We also had come to the conclusion that we really wanted to go back and explore the United Church of Christ again, so we did. Jill wasn&#8217;t so sure about coming back South--or coming South at all, she wouldn&#8217;t be returning at that point--but she said, &#8220;Well, if there was a church open in Chapel Hill,&#8221; one of the few places she could name in North Carolina, she would consider it. So when I called down to the Southern conference they said, &#8220;Well, there just happens to be this church in Chapel Hill that&#8217;s open.&#8221;
EF: Perfect.
RE: Yeah, so, providential. [Laughs]
EF: Right.
RE: So we came here in the spring of 1979 for interviews. And they called us and we began here the first Sunday in June of 1979.
EF: Wow. Can you talk a bit about what it was--? I know regionally the draw back down South, but could you talk a bit about why you wanted to explore the United Church of Christ a bit more--?
RE: Sure.
EF: [Choosing UCC over] the Methodist Church?
RE: Well, I&#8217;ll give one little anecdote. One of the things that&#8217;s different about being in the South, and you realize the rhythm of your life: there&#8217;s something about standing ankle-deep in snow and saying, &#8220;He is risen,&#8221; and it doesn&#8217;t seem to ring. [Laughs]
EF: [Laughs]
RE: You expect the dogwoods to be out.
EF: Right.
RE: But part of what drew us to the United Church of Christ was clearly this is a church that was striving to engage the world prophetically, and it was striving to be faithful to a deep tradition of Christianity, but also striving to be faithful about the engagement with the world, so that attracted us. We had experienced that while in seminary and have continued to experience that to be one of the hallmarks of the United Church of Christ. It&#8217;s a tradition that&#8217;s willing to take a risk and thus it steps forward. Our former president once talked about being first responders, so I sometimes have found that the United Church of Christ has been one of those first responders.
EF: So you came to Chapel Hill in 1979.
RE: Yes.
EF: Can you talk about those first few months, or first year or so of transitioning down here into the church?
RE: I guess one of the things, when we came down at that point in time, we were coming down as two people sharing one job, one position, which was actually a lovely thing to have as a young couple because, one, you had a little more time. We had more time to explore our calling and more time to explore what were the opportunities here, what are the things that can be done around the church, because we were essentially part-time. But yet you were able to put in a lot of time, so it gave us an opportunity to really explore the community and be a part of UNC in some ways that we&#8217;ve not been able to do since then. That part was the honeymoon part, if you will, of having that extra time. Now, we didn&#8217;t have any extra money. [Laughs] It was like a continuation of the graduate student life.  But, fortunately for us, over time the church began to grow and we were able to begin a family just a few years later, with the birth of our daughter, and fortunately that has continued over time. Originally we started out as half-time and we became five-eighths time, and then three-quarters time, and seven-eighths time, to where now we&#8217;re both full-time.
EF: Finally.
RE: Yeah, finally. It was a long journey but it certainly has paid off.
EF: Can you talk a little bit about some of the people or the characteristics of the church when you first came down here, and how that changed over time?
RE: One of the things I would say, and I suspect part of what was attractive to the congregation about us as a couple, is that the congregation was a very interesting mix of people. The United Church of Christ, because it is so strongly in the New England area with the Congregational Church, you had people in the congregation who had come from a United Church of Christ church in New England but were part of the university, so here they were in this small UCC church now in Chapel Hill. Meanwhile, the United Church of Christ, we also have a branch of our church. Four different denominations came together in the 1950s: the Congregational Church, the Christian Church, and then two German groups, the Evangelical and Reformed. But this little Christian group was a breakaway from the Methodists, and primarily here in North Carolina, Elon University, is a part of that heritage. So you had some people that were part of the congregation that were historically out of that Christian tradition and they were more, you might say, rooted Southerners. And then you had the transplanted New Englanders, and so that made up this body, this little community that was the United Church of Chapel Hill when we arrived. So having the two of us come, both having been educated in New England, Jill being from the North, I being from the South, it made a nice harmony, and we reflected the congregation in some way. I would say since that time the congregation has grown in persons that have come from so many different traditions, and that&#8217;s increasingly true of all congregations now. The sense of being a lifelong member of a particular denomination is fleeting, so that&#8217;s not as prominent as it once was.

EF: Right. Well I know one of the things that drew you to this church, as you said, was the community involvement, the social action aspects of it.
RE: Right.
EF: So when you came here, can you talk a bit about what the church had been doing as far as social action, and how did it change?
RE: The two strongest things that the congregation was doing at the time when we arrived, one, they were very involved with the Interfaith Council, an ecumenical social service agency here in the community, and are still very involved with it. We were near campus at that point in time, right off of Cameron Avenue. And around one of the corners, on Wilson Street, the church ended up owning two houses that backed up to the church itself. One of those houses we used as a church house for church offices and the like, and the other house was used by the Interfaith Council, and for probably thirty years, the Interfaith Council operated out of that house. So that was one thing.         The other major mission emphasis of the congregation at that point in time was the Chapel Hill Daycare Center. This was a daycare center that was intentionally half black, half white. They sought to have economic diversity as well. To do so we had the help of the Chapel Hill Service League. [It and] the church were working jointly, and also at that point in time the social service agency that was overseeing some county monies would only give money to daycares that were of a certain quality and the like. So it made it possible, when all those things were working together, to really have a high quality daycare experience for a diverse economic population. Over time, as more and more people were looking for daycare, the county changed its rules to serve more people in more places and thus there was a little less money coming from the county for people who may have had economic needs. The Chapel Hill Service League sought to change its focus and it was pulling out. This is much later; this is probably ten or fifteen years into our ministry that we had the challenge of really how to keep this wonderful thing that got started, how to keep it going. It actually moved, it&#8217;s now in Southern Village, and it&#8217;s probably twice or three times the size that it was originally, but as it grew in numbers it had more [of] the right sizing to really do more, economy of size to actually offer some of the scholarships that we suddenly found ourselves unable to do.
EF: Right.
RE: So those were the two major projects when we first got to town.
EF: You mentioned the Interfaith Council. I&#8217;m so interested in that. Can you describe what it is exactly, and how you and Jill and the church have been involved with the Interfaith Council in Chapel Hill?
RE: Well the Interfaith Council got started really with seven congregations coming together to form this ecumenical social service agency, and this was a way of helping people in such a manner that they didn&#8217;t have to go from one church to the next. We pooled resources such that they would come to one place and they would receive assistance for heating bills or rent assistance or whatever in one place instead of having to go to every church in town.         So when we first arrived, the Interfaith Council really had two wings. One was individual services and one was community services. The individual services was helping people that came with need for food, they had need for shelter, they had need for electrical bills being paid or whatever. And then community services was where, as an agency, we looked at how to take all those individual needs and see if there was something systemic that we should be working on. For example, there are several housing projects in town that were sponsored by the Interfaith Council in response to the need for more low income housing. The Interfaith Council started what would be the first thrift shop, and later the PTA really took that over so we let go of it. We even did some early work that would be now likened to Habitat for Humanity. There were things like that that would have fallen into that community services area.         I&#8217;m going to say some time in the mid-1980s, with the changes that took place in the Reagan administration and the changes with healthcare and the mental health system, we started having more people on the street and more people in need of a meal and a kitchen, so we helped establish a soup kitchen in town known as the Interfaith Council Community Kitchen and then we also helped found the Interfaith Council Community Shelter. Over time both of those two things ended up in the old municipal building for the town of Chapel Hill, and that&#8217;s where [they are] to this day. We are now, right across the parking lot from where we&#8217;re sitting, the ground is being broken for a new transitional men&#8217;s shelter that hopefully will be--. They&#8217;re going to break ground here this month, but then it&#8217;ll rest for about six months so the fundraising can catch up, and then next March, we&#8217;ll resume the building, so it probably will not open for another fifteen to eighteen months. But the idea there is we&#8217;ll have a place for men to come and live and gain life skills and job skills and be able to stay there longer than like a two-week stay, but they would be involved in programs so that by the time they came out they would be able to have an independent life.
EF: Absolutely.
RE: The Interfaith Council was able to do that for women some years ago with Project Home Start, which is around the corner from here, and typically with women it&#8217;s women and families, women and children. It&#8217;s been a successful program, offering a space not where people come in and they have a two-week stay, but they actually get involved in a program, they go through some courses on life skills, they have time to earn some money and to put some money aside, and then can move out on their own. It&#8217;s been very successful, and we see the same program happening for men next door.
EF: Yeah, absolutely.
RE: I&#8217;ve been involved with the Interfaith Council, gosh, very early on. They got me on the board and I became president back some time in the mid to late 1980s, and I&#8217;m back on the board again, so it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been near and dear to my heart.
EF: That&#8217;s great. Well, let me pivot a little bit and ask about the process of the United Church of Chapel Hill becoming open and affirming in the early 1990s and accepting gay members, lesbian members. Can you talk a bit about the origins of that movement in the church and what happened?
RE: The origins of that movement really came out of being driven by parents.
EF: Really?
RE: We knew we had people that were participating in the church who were gay or lesbian, but like a lot of the world, they were really closeted at that point in time. But the people that started speaking up in the late 1980s and 1990s were parents. We had one family that had lost a son to AIDS and another family that was very active in the church that had a gay son. We had several families and so it was really parents wanting to say, &#8220;Look, I need a place I can come and talk about this.&#8221; You can&#8217;t take away the fear that people had of AIDS, so these were parents that were really quite fearful they were going to lose [a loved one]. One family had lost, but there were other families that were really quite fearful of losing a child and they wanted to be able to talk about it without people first having to go through, &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;         So we started a series of conversations in 1991. I will say that our denomination, in 1985, had come up asking for congregations to engage in conversations around being open and affirming, and so we took that up and started what really ended up being a two-year conversation. We would have a series of conversations, then we&#8217;d stop and have a different series, then we&#8217;d come back and have yet another series of conversations. So at the end of that time the congregation wrote a covenant and we voted on it, and I don&#8217;t have the exact number in front of me but I&#8217;ll say it passed with just a few dissenting votes. Actually we probably would have passed [it] from day one, but the process was very important because it allowed people who were squeamish to come along, and it allowed those who perhaps would have readily voted to say yes, it allowed them to really get more deeply immersed in what the issues were and know the struggle that other people were having around the issue. It became a real gift to have that time. Since then, I&#8217;ll say that the involvement of gay and lesbian people in the ministry and as ministers has done nothing but enrich the congregation.
EF: The church seemed to embrace it, but what about the wider Chapel Hill community when they heard that this was happening?
RE: The wider community probably heard more at that time about another church in town. [Laughs] Binkley Baptist [Church] was going through a similar process, at an almost parallel time, but they had someone that they were seeking to ordain and had to make it by a certain time limit so there was more pressure. We simply did this until we were ready to take a vote, which was a help. I think they ended up having a timeline that they had to make a decision by, so they got a little more pressed because of that.
EF: Sure.
RE: But I will say that both our congregations, both Binkley and United Church, had some members that--and I think in both cases just a handful, but still--that went to other congregations in town. Many congregational leaders that I know, who I spoke with, would say things like--. [Phone ringing]
EF: I can pause this.
RE: No, no. Would say things like they&#8217;re very sympathetic and personally would be very welcoming but weren&#8217;t sure that they could do it as a church.
EF: Sure. Okay, well let me ask about then too, I guess one of the next big changes was the relocation of the church.
RE: Yes.
EF: Can you talk a bit about that?
RE: Relocation made becoming open and affirming a walk in the park.
EF: [Laughs] Wow.
RE: [Laughs] Well, one of the things about the life of faith is that we--and particularly, I would say, with Christianity--we are very materialistic. And when we talk about the incarnation, that God became in flesh, well we also talk about the way in which hope and love and faith become in flesh, by our actions and also by the touchstones around us, and some of those touchstones surprise you at times. Yes, we&#8217;ve all sung the little childhood ditty about &#8220;this is the church, this is the steeple, but the church is the people,&#8221; but at the same time, suddenly: &#8220;That&#8217;s where I was married. That&#8217;s where my child was baptized. That&#8217;s where we had the funeral for George.&#8221; And so suddenly this place becomes heavy with memories and meanings that you can&#8217;t begin to pull apart. People surprised themselves at times with how important the sense of space was, and yet at the same time, [the church] went around the block multiple times.         We were in a lovely little space, and it&#8217;s currently being used as the graduate student union for the University [of North Carolina at Chapel Hill], and, like I said, it&#8217;s a jewel of a little building. People loved it in there, it was very intimate, but at the same time we&#8217;d gone to having two services, we were practically hanging off the rafters, so we knew something had to be done. So that was exciting, but there&#8217;s no extra land next to the University. So we kept discerning what to do and we came up with one plan, but that plan really only got us twelve more seats, so it seemed like a lot of money to spend for twelve more seats. We kept going round and round as to what to do because people were really torn. Many people were attracted to the church because they weren&#8217;t brick and mortar people. They were interested in action, they were interested in doing, they were interested in serving. They weren&#8217;t brick and mortar people. So then we really had to struggle with, &#8220;How is it that we create more space for ourselves, and how are we going to do that?&#8221;        So it was really about a ten-year process from start to finish. We started really the conversation in 1989 or 1990 with a retreat to write a mission statement for ourselves so that we were very clear about what we wanted for ourselves, and then by the time we moved in here, it was Easter of 2000.
EF: Wow.
RE:  But along the way we looked at a variety [of options]. We even looked at buying another church building. At that point in time St. Thomas More [Catholic Church] had come up for sale, at one point in time [when] we looked at land. Initially we looked at another piece of land, turned that down, and then St. Thomas More had declared their intention to build a new church, so we looked at that and eventually turned that down. Then we were in a quandary of what to do. We worshiped in the Wesley Foundation for a number of years, and we finally broke the logjam and bought land out on Martin Luther King and moved there. Now, fortunately, the University  has somewhat followed us because one of the things we didn&#8217;t want to lose was having the University, but now Carolina North is going to be next door.
EF: Oh yeah.
RE: So maybe not next year, but in the decades to come, the University will be more present out here than it is now. Also one of the things we didn&#8217;t want to leave behind was the Interfaith Council, and now Project Home Start is around the corner with the women&#8217;s shelter and the men&#8217;s transitional shelter will be next door. So, in a strange way, we&#8217;ve come full circle. [Laughs]
EF: Right. That&#8217;s so interesting. Well my next question is something more recent, about Moral Mondays.
RE: Yes.
EF: So I&#8217;d love to hear about your take on the Moral Mondays this year, in 2013, and your involvement.
RE: We actually ended up at, I guess, maybe the second Moral Monday. We knew we had some members that would be stepping forward in civil disobedience or, as they say, &#8220;exercising one&#8217;s constitutional rights.&#8221; So we went there, and at that time there was probably only, oh, maybe twenty-five or thirty witnesses that had gathered outside and a number of people who then stepped forward to be arrested. Since that time, over the following twelve weeks, it has grown to where there are thousands of people coming forward and nine hundred and twenty people have stepped forward to be arrested, including Susan Steinberg, and Jill and myself, and another fifteen people from the congregation.         I think one of the things that has really struck people is that we are a part of faith covenant, and really our civic covenant, is one of expansion. We see ourselves in this covenant of grace that is expanding to include more people, and we see our civic covenant as much the same: it&#8217;s expanding to include more people, and that&#8217;s certainly been the history of this country. It expanded to include African Americans, once enslaved; it expanded to include Native Americans, once denied the vote; it expanded to include women. So then to have this sense of expansion, this open-handed way in which this covenant has exercised our citizenship, then to see it turned around where it&#8217;s increasingly this exclusive covenant that the state government or the legislature was putting forth of excluding people from voting, of excluding people from Medicare, of excluding people from unemployment benefits, it was so prominently against the covenants that really give us life.  People really have been very supportive of stepping forward and saying, &#8220;No. This is not life-giving.&#8221;
EF: Can you talk about your own arrest experience?
RE: I would say the arrest experience is one of more tedium [laughs] than anything. You go forward, and then you&#8217;re cuffed and you&#8217;re taken down into the basement of the capitol building, and there they get your name and process all that information, and they put you on a bus and take you to the Wake County Detention Center. There they actually take off the handcuffs that are these plastic things. They snip them off and then you go see the magistrate. Early on it took a lot longer, but I was about midstream and so by then they were trying to process things a lot quicker, whereas some of the people early on weren&#8217;t getting out until midmorning I was out by 10:00, so it moved along. But there was a lot of that hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait. I mean, you know that you are participating in political theater. The arresting officers know they are part of a political theater. The magistrate knows this is part of political theater. Everybody knows it&#8217;s political theater and that a point is being made. We&#8217;re not there to antagonize the police, we&#8217;re not there to antagonize the magistrate or Wake County, but it&#8217;s really to have a voice beyond that local setting.
